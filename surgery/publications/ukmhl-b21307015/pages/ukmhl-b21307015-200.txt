170 SUPERFICIAL CERVICAL NERVES. The Auricularis magnus (fig. 14. 13.), the largest of the three, pierces the fascia, ancl accompanies the external jugular vein. It is distributed to the integument over the parotid gland, and to the external ear, and communicates with the facial nerve. The Occipitalis minor (fig. 14. 14.) ascends along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and is dis- tributed to the integument of the occiput. Having learned the jugular vein and ascending nerves of the cervical plexus, attention must now be directed to the sterno-mastoid muscle, from which the fascia should be removed so as to expose its entire length. The fascia should also be dissected from the whole of the rest of the neck, both before and behind the sterno-mastoid, so as to enable us to examine the deep parts as an entire layer. Behind the sterno-mastoid some difficulty will arise in the dissection, from the number of branches given off by the cervical plexus. When this preparation has been entirely completed, the side of the neck will present a pretty regular square ; â€” bounded above by the margin of the lower jaw and occiput, below by the clavicle, in front by the middle line of the neck, and behind by the vertebral column. The sterno- mastoid muscle (fig. 14. l.) extends diagonally across * Fig. H* The triangles of the neck, with the external jugular vein and ascending branches of the cervical plexus. No. 1. The sterno-mastoid muscle, which divides the side of the

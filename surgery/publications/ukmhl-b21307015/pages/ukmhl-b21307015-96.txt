ACTIONS OF MUSCLES. 66 Adduction. Abduction. T . • f 1 dorsal. Interossei, 3 dorsal, u eiossei,plantar. Abductor minimi digiti. The great toe, like the thumb in the hand, enjoys an independence of action, and is therefore provided with distinct muscles to perform its movements. But even here the direction of the actions is nothing more than is possessed by each of the other toes, and may be referred to the same plan, thus : — Flexion. Flexor longus pollicis, brevis pollicis. Adduction. Adductor pollicis. Extension. Extensor proprius pollicis, brevis digitorum. Abduction. Abductor pollicis. The only muscles excluded from this table are the lum- bricales, four small muscles, which, from their attachments to the tendons of the long flexor, appear to be assistants to their action ; and the transversus pedis, a small muscle placed transversely in the foot across the heads of the metatarsal bones, which has for its office the drawing to- gether of the toes.

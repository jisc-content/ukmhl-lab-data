ATLO-AXOID ARTICULATION. 451 3. Articulation of the axis with the occipital hone. — The ligaments of this articulation are four in number, Anterior occipito-axoid, Posterior occipito-axoid, Two odontoid. The Anterior ligament is a narrow band of fibres as- cending from the body of the axis to the basilar process, i close to the foramen magnum. The Posterior ligament (apparatus ligamentosus colli) is a broad band, and apparently a continuation of the posterior common ligament: it is attached below to the posterior surface of the body of the axis, and spreads out superiorly to be inserted into the inner surface of the basilar process. It covers in the odontoid process and alar ligaments. The Odontoid ligaments (alar) are two short and thick fasciculi of fibres that pass outwards from the apex of the odontoid process to the sides of the occipital foramen and condyles. 4. Articulation of the atlas with the axis. — The liga- ments of this articulation are five in number : — Anterior atlo-axoid, Posterior atlo-axoid, Two capsular, Transverse. The Anterior ligament is a membranous layer, passing between the lower border of the anterior arch of the atlas, and the body of the axis. The Posterior ligament is a membranous layer, passing between the posterior arch of the atlas, and the arches of the axis. The Capsular ligaments surround the articular pro- cesses of the atlas and axis, and are provided with synovial membranes. The Transverse ligament is a strong ligamentous band, crossing the area of the ring of the atlas from the inner surface of one articular process to the other. It serves to retain the odontoid process of the axis, in connection with the anterior arch of the atlas. As it crosses the odontoid process, some fibres are sent downwards to be

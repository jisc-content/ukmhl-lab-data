294 LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. Puncta laclirymalia. — Near to the inner canthus are two slight projections on the edges of the eyelids. These are the lachrymal tubercles {Jig. 33. 5.), and upon the point of each may be seen a small opening, the punc- tum lachrymale, the commencement of the corresponding lachrymal duct. From these points the lachrymal ducts, 6. 6., proceed to the lachrymal sac. The superior duct * Fig. 33. The lachrymal apparatus and tarsal cartilages of the eyelids. No. 1.

115 LUNGS. Vessels and Nerves. The Arteries of the parietes of the chest are the aortic intercostals; superior intercostals, from the subclavian; anterior intercostals, from the internal mammary; and the thoracic branches from the axillary. The Nerves are the intercostal and thoracic branches. Viscera of the Thorax. The contents of the chest are the lungs and heart, with their investing membranes, and the great vessels. The Lungs occupy the sides of the chest. In the healthy state they are of a pinkish grey colour mottled with black. The Right lung (fig. 11. l.) is larger than the left, in consequence of the inclination of the heart to the left side; it is also shorter, from the encroachment of the liver upon the right side, which presses the diaphragm upwards considerably above the level of the left. The right lung has three lobes, of which the middle is the smallest, and is placed anteriorly. The left lung has only two. Each lung is retained in its place by its root {fig. 11.3.3.), which is formed by the pulmonary artery and veins and bronchial tubes, together with the bronchial vessels and pulmonary plexuses of nerves. The large vessels of the root of the lung are arranged in the same order from before, backwards, on both sides, viz, — Pulmonary veins, Pulmonary artery, Bronchus. Prom above, downwards, on the right side, this order is exactly reversed. On the left side the bronchus has to stoop beneath the arch of the aorta, which alters its position to the vessels. They are thus disposed on the two sides : — Right. Bronchus, Artery, Veins. Left. Artery, Bronchus, Veins. Structure. — The lungs are composed of the ramifi- cations of the bronchial tubes, which terminate in bron-

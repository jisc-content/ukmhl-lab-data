r 468 LIGAMENTS OF THE HIP-JOINT. The Ligamentum teres is somewhat triangular in form ; it is attached by its base to the lower part of the cup of the acetabulum, and by a rounded apex into the depres- sion upon the middle of the head of the femur. The Cotyloid ligament is a strong ligamentous cord attached to the margin of the acetabulum, which it serves to deepen. The Transverse ligament is the extension of the coty- loid ligament across the notch in the acetabulum. It forms an arch across the notch, beneath which the arti- cular branches of the internal circumflex and obturator arteries enter the joint. In the bottom of the acetabulum is a deep depression, which is filled with fat covered by synovial membrane, which serves as a kind of elastic cushion to the head of the bone. This was formerly considered as the synovial gland of the joint. The Synovial membrane is extensive; it invests the head of the femur, and is continued around the ligamen- tum teres into the acetabulum, and is thence reflected upon the inner surface of the capsular ligament. Dislocations. — The dislocations of the hip joint are four in number : — 1. Upwards, upon the dorsum of the ilium. 2. Downwards, into the foramen ovale. 3. Backwards and upivai'ds, into the ischiatic notch. 4. Fomvards and upwards, upon the body of the pubis. 2. Knee joint. — The ligaments of the knee joint are thirteen in number ; they are, Anterior or ligamentum patellae, Posterior or ligamentum posticum Winslowii, Internal lateral, Two external lateral, Anterior or external crucial, Posterior or internal crucial. Transverse, Two coronary, Ligamentum mucosum, Ligamenta alaria, Two semilunar fibro-cartilages, Synovial membrane.

417 CHAPTER XI. I SYMPATHETIC NERVE. he Sympathetic nerve consists of a chain of ganglia, itending along the side of the vertebral column from the ;ad to the coccyx; communicating with all the other irves of the body; and distributing branches to all the ternal organs and viscera. It communicates with the other nerves immediately at eir exit from the cranium and vertebral canal. The urth and sixth nerves, however, form an exception to this le, for with these it unites in the cavernous sinus ; and ith the olfactory, optic, and auditory, at their ultimate :pansions. The branches of distribution accompany the arteries tiich are distributed to the different organs; and form immunications around them, which are called plexuses ; id take the name of the artery with which they are sociated : thus we have the mesenteric plexus, hepatic exus, splenic plexus, Ac. All the internal organs of the sad, neck, and trunk, are supplied with branches from le sympathetic, and some of them exclusively ; hence it is jnsidered a nerve of organic life. It is called the ganglionic nerve, from the circumstance 'being formed by a number of ganglia ; and from the con- ant disposition which it evidences, in its distribution, to jmmunicate and form small knots or ganglia. There are six sympathetic ganglia in the head; vis., the inglion of Ribes; the ciliary, or lenticular; the naso- jlatine, or Cloquet’s ; the spheno-palatine, or Meckel’s; ie submaxillary; and the otic, or Arnold’s: three in the icli; superior, middle, and inferior: twelve in the dorsal \gion; four in the lumbar region ; and four or five in the icral region. Each ganglion may be considered as a distinct centre, ving off branches in four different directions, viz., iperior or ascending, to communicate with the ganglion t 5

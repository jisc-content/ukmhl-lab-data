kiernan’s researches. 358 it surrounds the vessels completely, but in the smaller it is situated only to that side on which the duct and artery are placed; the opposite side of the portal vein being in close contact with the capsular sur- faces of the lobules. The Inter-lobular portion forming the sheath of each of the lobules, and occupying the inter-lobular fissures, gives support to the ramifi- cations of the portal vein, nepatic ducts, and artery, previously to their entrance into the lobules The Lobular portion accompanies the vessels into the substance of the lobule. The Portal vein ramifies through the liver in canals which commence at the transverse fissure, and spread from below upwards throughout the entire organ. These portal canals are formed by the capsular surfaces of the lobules, and contain, besides the vein, a duct and an artery. The branches of the vein, according to the arrangement established by Mr. Kiernan, are divisible into those which are given off in the canals, vaginal; those which ramify into the inter-lobular fissures, inter-lobular ; and the terminal branches which are distributed within the lobules, lobular. The trunks of the portal vein, hepatic duct, and artery, are com- pletely surrounded by Glisson’s capsule in the larger canals; but in the smaller ones (Jig. 43.) the capsule (9.) is situated only at that side * Fig. 43.

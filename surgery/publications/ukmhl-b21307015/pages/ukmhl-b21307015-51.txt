Tendon of psoas and iliacus. RELATIONS AND BRANCHES* I Adductor longus. 21 Plan of the relations of the femoral artery. Inner Side. Superiorly, the femoral vein. Branches. — The superficial circumflexa ilii, superficial epigastric, superficial and deep external pudics, are four small arteries given off from the femoral, immediately be- low Poupart’s ligament. The distribution of the first three has been described at page 12. The superficial epigastric and superficial pudic are important, from their connection with hernial tumours occurring in this region : we have seen both of them crossing an inguinal, and the latter ramifying upon a femoral hernia. In the operation they are liable to division; but, from their small size, would cause very little inconvenience. The deep external pudic is so named from being placed beneath the fascia lata : it is given off from the femoral about an inch below the superficial pudic, and, at the inner border of the thigh, pierces the fascia, to be dis- tributed to the integuments of the scrotum and labium pudendi. The Profunda femoris artery is given off from the fe- moral, at two inches below Poupart’s ligament. From its large size, it may be considered as a division of the femoral rather than a branch : and, in this view, the short trunk has been called the common femoral (femoralis com- munis), and its two divisions, femoralis superficialis and femoralis profunda ; the superficial femoral being in- tended for the supply of the knee and leg, while the pro- funda is distributed to the thigh. The profunda artery is best examined by removing the superficial femoral, and dissecting away the femoral and profunda veins, that con- Front. Fascia lata. Saphenous nerves. Sartorius. Outer Side.

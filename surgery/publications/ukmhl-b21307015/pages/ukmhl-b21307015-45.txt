MUSCLES. — ANTERIOR FEMORAL GROUP. 15 Muscles of the Anterior Femoral Region. The muscles of the anterior femoral region are ar- ranged in two groups, an anterior group, consisting of six Tensor vaginae femoris, Sartorius, Rectus, Vastus internus, Vastus externus, Crureus. And an internal group of seven, viz.: — Iliacus internus, Psoas magnus, Pectineus, Adductor longus,* Adductor brevis, Adductor magnus, Gracilis. As soon as these two tables are got by heart, the student may com- mence the dissection of the muscles which they represent. Anterior group.—The Tensorvagincefenioris(stretcher of the sheath of the thigh) is a short flat muscle, situated on the outer side of the hip. It arises from the crest of the ilium, near to its anterior superior spinous process, and is inserted between two layers of the fascia lata at about one third down the thigh. The Sartorius (tailor’s muscle) is a long riband-like muscle, arising from the curved notch, between the an- terior superior, and anterior inferior spinous processes of the ilium : it crosses obliquely the upper third of the thigh, descends behind the inner condyle of the femur, and is inserted by an aponeurotic expansion into the inner tuberosity of the tibia. This expansion covers in the insertion of the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles. The upper border of the sartorius muscle is the guide to the operation for tying the femoral artery in the middle of its course. The Rectus (straight) muscle is fusiform in its shape and bipenniform in the disposition of its fibres: it arises by two round tendons — one from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, the other from the upper muscles — / . k

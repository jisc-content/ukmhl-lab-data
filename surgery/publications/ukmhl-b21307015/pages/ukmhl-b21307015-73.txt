RELATIONS AND BRANCHES. 43 Plan of the relations of the popliteal artery. Inner Side. Front. * Popliteal nerve. Popliteal vein. Popliteal artery. Behind. Outer Side. Femur. Ligamentum posticum Winslowii. Popliteal fascia. Branches: Superior external articular, internal articular, Azygos articular, Inferior external, internal, Sural. The Superior articular arteries, external and internal, wind around the femur immediately above the condyles, to the front of the knee-joint, anastomosing with each other, with the external circumflex, the anastomotica magna, the inferior articular and the recurrent of the an- terior tibial. The external passes beneath the tendon of the biceps, and the internal through an arched opening beneath the tendon of the adductor magnus. The Azygos articular artery pierces the posterior liga- ment of the joint, ligamentum posticum Winslowii, and supplies the synovial membrane, in its interior. The Inferior articular arteries wind around the head of the tibia, immediately below the joint, and anastomose with each other, the superior articular arteries, and the recurrent of the anterior tibial. The external passes beneath the two external lateral ligaments of the joint, and the internal beneath the internal lateral ligament. The Sural arteries (sura, the calf) are muscular branches of large size and variable number, distributed to the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. * This expression, as in all cases of dissection of the posterior aspect of a limb, has relation to the dissector, and not to the limb itself.

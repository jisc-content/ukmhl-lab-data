467 LIGAMENTS.— LOWER EXTREMITY. x 6 The Lateral ligaments are very strong; they are the principal bond of connection between the bones. The extensor tendon takes the place and performs the office of a posterior ligament. Dislocations. — The second phalanges are but rarely dislocated from the first. The last phalanges are dislocated from the second backivards ; the base of the last phalanx resting upon the back of the second beneath the extensor tendon. The same dislocation occurs in the thumb. Ligaments oe the Lower Extremity. The Ligaments of the lower extremity, like those of the upper, may be arranged in the order of the joints to which they belong ; they are, the 1. Hip joint. 2. Knee joint. 3. Articulation between the tibia and fibula. 4. Ankle joint. 5. Articulation of the tarsal bones. 6. Tarso-metatarsal articulation. 7. Metatarso-phalangeal articulation. 8. Articulation of the phalanges. 1. Hip joint. — The Ligaments of the ilio-femoral arti- culation are five in number ; they are, the Capsular, Ilio-femoral, Teres, Cotyloid, Transverse. The Capsular ligament is a strong ligamentous capsule attached around the acetabulum and around the neck of the femur, and connecting the two bones firmly together. It is much thicker upon the upper part of the joint, where more resistance is required, than upon the under part. It likewise extends farther upon the neck of the femur on the anterior, than on the posterior side. The Ilio-femoral ligament is an accessory band, which descends from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium to the neck of the femur, and strengthens the an- terior surface of the capsular ligament.

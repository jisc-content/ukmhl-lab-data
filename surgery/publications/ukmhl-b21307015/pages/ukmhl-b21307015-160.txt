130 ARCH OF THE AORTA. Arch. â€” The upper border of the arch is parallel with the second dorsal vertebra, and it terminates opposite the lower border of the third. The anterior surface of the arch is crossed by the left pneumogastric nerve, and the cardiac branches of that nerve, and of the sympathetic. The posterior surface of the arch is in relation with the bifurcation of the trachea and great cardiac plexus, the cardiac and left recurrent nerves, and the thoracic duct. The superior border gives off the three great arteries, viz. the innominata, left carotid, and left subclavian. The inferior border or concavity of the arch is in rela- tion with the remains of the ductus arteriosus, the cardiac ganglion and left x'ecurrent nerve, and has passing beneath it the right pulmonary artery and left bronchus.

The Descending aorta is situated in the posterior me- diastinum, and rests upon the vertebral column. Its relations will be described with that space. The Pulmonary artery {fig. 12. 13.) arises from the upper part of the left side of the right ventricle, in front of the origin of the aorta. It ci'osses the root of the aorta somewhat obliquely to the under surface of the arch, to which it is connected by a ligamentous cord {fig. 12.*), the remains of the ductus arteriosus.

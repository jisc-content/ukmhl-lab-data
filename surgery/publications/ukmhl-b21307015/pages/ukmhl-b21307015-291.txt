CONVERGING FIBRES. 261 traverse successively the thalamus opticus and corpus striatum, and become developed into the convolutions of the upper part of the hemispheres and posterior lobe. The Corpora restiformia diverge as they approach the cerebellum, and leave between them the cavity of the fourth ventricle. They then enter the substance of the cerebellum under the form of two rounded cords. These cords envelope the corpora rhomboidea, or ganglia of increase, and then expand on all sides so as to constitute the cerebellum. In addition to the diverging fibres which are thus shown to constitute both the cerebrum and cerebellum, by their increase and development, another set of fibres are found to exist, which have for their office the association of the symmetrical halves. These are called from their direction converging fibres, and from their office commissures. The commissures of the cerebrum and cerebellum are, the Corpus callosum, Fornix, Septum lucidum, Anterior commissure, Middle commissure, Posterior commissure, Peduncles of the pineal gland, Processus h cerebello ad testes, Valve of Vieussens, Pons Varolii. The Corpus callosum is the commissure of the hemi- spheres. It is therefore of moderate thickness in the middle, where its fibres pass directly from one hemisphere to the other — thicker in front, where the anterior lobes are connected, and thickest behind where the fibres from the posterior lobes are assembled. riie Fornix is an antero-posterior commissure, and serves to connect a number of parts. Below it is asso- ciated with the thalami optici; on each side by means of the corpora fimbriata with the middle lobes of the brain, and above, with the corpus callosum, and consequently with the hemispheres. • The Septum lucidum is a perpendicular commissure > between the fornix and corpus callosum.

262 CEREBRAL NERVES. The Anterior commissure connects together the anterior portions of the posterior lobes of the brain, and the corpora striata. The Middle commissure is a layer of grey substance, uniting the thalami optici. The Posterior commissure is a white rounded cord, con- necting the thalami optici. The Peduncles of the pineal gland must also be regarded as commissures, assisted in their function by the grey sub- stance of the gland. The Processus e cerehello ad testes is the means of com- munication between the white substance of the cerebellum and cerebrum ; and the linguetta laminosa and valve of Vieussens perform the same office to the grey sub- stance. The Pons Varolii is the commissure to the two lobes of the cerebellum. It consists of transverse fibres, which are split into two layers by the passage of the fasciculi of the corpora pyramidalia and olivaria. These two layers, the superior and inferior, are collected together on each side, in the formation of the crura cerebelli. Cerebral Nerves. There are nine pairs of cerebral nerves. Taken in their order from before, backwards, they are 1st. Olfactory. 2d. Optic. 3d. Motores oculorum. 4th. Pathetici (trochleares). 5th. Trifacial (trigemini). 6th. Abducentes. _ I J Facial (portio dura). 1 1" \ Auditory (portio mollis). {Glosso-pharyngeal, Pneumogastric (vagus, par vagum). Spinal accessory. 9th. Lingual (hypoglossal). Functionally or physiologically they are divided into four groups, and in this order we shall examine them.

429 SOLAR PLEXUS. aortic, and follow the course of the intercostal arteries to that trunk : the branches of the lower ganglia unite to form the two splanchnic nerves. The Great splanchnic nerve, 12., arises from the sixth dorsal ganglion, and receives branches from the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, which augment it to a nerve of considerable size. It descends in front of the vertebral column, within the posterior mediastinum, pierces the diaphragm immediately to the outer side of each crus, and terminates in the semilunar ganglion. The Lesser splanchnic nerve (renal), 14., is formed by filaments from the tenth, eleventh, and, sometimes, from the twelfth dorsal ganglia. It pierces the diaphragm, and descends to join the renal plexus. TheSemilunar ganglion, 13., is a large, irregular, gangli- form body, pierced by numerous openings, and appearing like the aggregation of a number of smaller ganglia, having spaces between them. It is situated by the side of the cceliac axis, and communicates with the ganglion of the opposite side, both above and below that trunk, so as to form a gangliform circle, from which branches pass off in all directions, like rays from a centre. Hence the entire circle has been named the solar plexus. The Solar plexus receives the great splanchnic nerves; part of the lesser splanchnic nerves ; the termination of the right pneumogastric nerve ; some branches from the right phrenic nerve ; and, sometimes, one or two filaments from the left. It gives off numerous filaments, which accompany, under the name of plexuses, all the branches given off by the abdominal aorta. Thus, we have derived from the solar plexus the Phrenic plexuses, Gastric plexus, Hepatic plexus, Splenic plexus, Supra-renal plexuses, Renal plexuses, Superior mesenteric plexus, Spermatic plexus, Inferior mesenteric plexus. The Renal plexus is formed chiefly by the lesser

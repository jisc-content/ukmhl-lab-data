472 T1BI0-FIBULAR ARTICULATION. above the patella, from the filling of the superior pouch of the synovial membrane. The superior pouch of the synovial membrane is sup- ported and raised during the movements of the limb by a small muscle, the subcrureus, which is inserted into it; see page 16. A quantity of oily fat is situated between the tendon of the patella and the synovial membrane, which pushes the membrane inwards towards the joint. Dislocations.— The Patella may be dislocated in three directions : — 1. Outwards, which is the most frequent. 2. Inwards, less frequent; in both these cases there will be rupture of the ligamentum patellae, unless there has been previous weakness of the joint. 3. Upwards, accompanied with rupture of the ligamen- tum patellae. The dislocations of the Knee-joint are four in number: — 1. Tibia forwards. 2. Tibia backwards. 3. Tibia to either side. The dislocations to either side are incomplete. The Semilunar fibro-cartilages may become displaced from relaxation of the ligaments of the knee, and become fixed between the condyles of the femur and the tibia, so as to render the joint immovable. 3. Articulation between the Tibia and Fibula. — The tibia and fibula are held firmly connected by means of seven ligaments : viz. The Anterior supet'ior ligament is a thin fasciculus passing between the anterior surface of the head of the fibula and the inner tuberosity of the tibia. The Posterior superior ligament is disposed in the same manner upon the posterior surface of the articulation. Interosseous superior, Interosseous inferior, Transverse.

FEMALE PERINEUM. 416 The Sphincter ani surrounds the lower extremity of the rectum, as in the male. The Levator ani is inserted into the side of the vagina and rectum. The Arteries of the perineum are branches of the in- ternal pudic, and are distributed as in the male : they are the External hemorrhoidal, Superficialis perinei, Vaginal arteries, Artery of the corpus cavernosum, Artery of the dorsum clitoridis. The Nerves accompany each of the branches of the artery, and are also derived from the internal pudic and from the hypogastric plexus.

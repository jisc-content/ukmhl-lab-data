The space between these two ligaments is the glottis, or rima glottidis. 4*. The ligaments of the epiglottis are five in number: â€” 1. Three folds of mucous membrane, one at the middle, and one at each side, called frcena epiglottidis, which hold the epiglottis back to the tongue. 2. Epiglotlo- hyoidean ligament, which connects the epiglottis to the posterior surface of the os hyoides. 3. The ligament which attaches the epiglottis to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage. The Muscles of the larynx are eight in number : the five larger are the muscles of the chordae vocales and rima glottidis ; the three smaller are muscles of the epi- glottis. The five muscles of the chordae vocales and rima glot- tidis are the Crico-thyroid, Crico-arytenoideus posticus, Crico-arytenoideus. lateralis, Thyro-arytenoideus, Arytenoideus. The Crico-thyroid muscle arises from the anterior sur- face of the cricoid cartilage, and is inserted into the lower and inner border of the thyroid. The Crico-arytenoideus posticus arises from the de- pression on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and is inserted into the base of the arytenoid. The Crico-arytenoideus lateralis arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid, and is inserted into the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The Thyro-arytenoideus arises from the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, close to the outer side of The chorda vocalis, and passes backwards parallel with the chord, to be inserted into the base of the arytenoid car- tilage. The Arytenoideus muscle occupies the posterior con- cave surface of the arytenoid cartilages, between which it is stretched. . It consists of several planes of transverse and oblique fibres: hence it was formerly considered as

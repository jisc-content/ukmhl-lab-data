236 ARACHNOID MEMBRANE. The Arteries of the dura mater are the Anterior meningeal from the internal carotid, Middle meningeal 1 ^ , . , Meningea parva j From the internal maxillary, Inferior meningeal from the ascending pharyngeal and occipital arteries, Posterior meningeal from the vertebral. The Nerves are derived from the nervi molles of the sympathetic, the Casserian ganglion, the ophthalmic nerve, and sometimes from the fourth ; they are given off while these nerves are situated by the side of the sella turcica. The branches of the ophthalmic and fourth nerves are re- current, and are distributed between the layers of the tentorium as far as the lateral sinus. Arachnoid Membrane. The Arachnoid (apoc^vYj — £<So?, like a spider’s web), so named from its extreme tenuity, is the serous membrane of the cerebro-spinal centre, and, like other serous mem- branes, a shut sac. It envelopes the brain and spinal cord, and is reflected upon the inner surface of the dura mater, giving to that membrane its serous investment. The arachnoid is thin and transparent on the upper surface of the brain, and may be demonstrated by in- serting a blowpipe, and injecting beneath it a stream of air. In other situations, as at the base of the brain and between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata, it is semi- transparent and dense in its structure, and is rendered very evident by passing across from one convexity to another. In inflammation of the meninges, this mem- brane is often thickened ond opake. The arachnoid is attached to the surface of the pia mater by a loose cellular tissue, the sub-arachnoidean. This tissue is filamentous at the base of the brain, be- tween the hemispheres, and around the spinal cord, where the arachnoid is disposed very loosely. The Sub-arachnoidean cellular tissue is the seat of an abundant serous secretion, the sub-arachnoidean fluid, which fills all the vacuities existing between the arachnoid and pia mater, and distends the arachnoid of the spinal

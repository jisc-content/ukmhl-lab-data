ORGAN OF VOICE. THE LARYNX. 312 in its interior : it is supplied with the means of nutrition by the vessels at its root. The Sebaceous follicles are abundant in some parts of the skin, as in the armpits, the nose, &c. They are small perpendicular pouches secreting a peculiar oily matter, and lined by a thin layer of cuticle. The Perspiratory ducts {fig. 36. 5.) are spiral tubes commencing apparently in the corium, and proceeding upwards between the papillae, to terminate by open pores upon the surface of the cuticle. They are easily seen by examining with the microscope a thin section of skin made perpendicularly to the surface. Their origin is not yet clearly made out. Breschet asserts that they proceed from distinct globular glands. Analogy is opposed to his view, but we have not yet succeeded in ascertaining their origin satisfactorily. If a portion of skin be scalded with hot water, and the cuticle raised, the perspiratory ducts may be seen most distinctly extended in straight lines between the separating layers. The Pores are best observed during perspiration, when the fluid is seen oozing through their minute openings. In the hand and sole of the foot they are easily seen by the naked eye without this assistance. They are disposed at regular distances along the ridges of the cuticle, and give rise to the appearance of lines cutting the ridges trans- versely. Although not an organ of sense, the larynx is very im- portant as an organ of relation : we have therefore given it a place in this chapter? ' The Larynx is situated at the forepart of the neck be- tween the trachea and the base of the tongue. It is composed of cartilages, ligaments, muscles, vessels, and nerves, and mucous membrane.

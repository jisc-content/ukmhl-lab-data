The external pillar, 7., which is at the same time inferior, from the obliquity of the opening, is inserted into spine of the pubis; the internal or superior pillar, 6., forms an inter- lacement with its fellow of the opposite side, over the front of the symphisis pubis. The external abdominal ring gives passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female: they are both invested in their passage through it by a thin fascia derived from the edges of the ring, and called inter-columnar fascia, or fascia spermatica. The pouch of inguinal hernia, in passing through this opening, receives the inter-columnar fascia, as one of its coverings. The posterior border of the external oblique is in close * Fig. 37.

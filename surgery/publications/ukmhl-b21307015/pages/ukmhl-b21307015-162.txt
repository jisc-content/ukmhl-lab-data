POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. 132 does the right. Hence the difference of relation of the two bronchi in the roots of the lungs. Posterior mediastinum. — If the lungs be removed near to their roots, or thrown to one side, the posterior mediastinum may be dissected and examined. The contents of the posterior mediastinum, are the Descending aorta, Vena azygos major, Vena azygos minor, Superior intercostal vein. Thoracic duct, (Esophagus, Pneumogastric nerves, Great splanchnic nerves.. The Descending or Thoracic aorta (fig. 11. 10.) is situ- ated to the left side of the vertebral column, but approaches the middle line as it descends, and at the aortic opening of the diaphragm is altogether in front of the column. After entering the abdomen, it again falls back to the left side. Relations. — It is in relation, behind, with the verte- bral column and lesser vena azygos; in front, with the oesophagus and right pneumogastric nerve ; to the left side, with the pleura; and to the right, with the thoracic duct.

Branches. — Its branches are pericardiac, bronchial, oesophageal, and intercostal arteries. The Pericardiac are a few twigs to the posterior part of the pericardium.

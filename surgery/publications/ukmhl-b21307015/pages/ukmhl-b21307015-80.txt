FOOT. DORSAL REGION. 50 foot obliquely, and terminates in four tendons, the inner- most of which is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, and the other three into the sides of the long extensor tendons of the second, third, and fourth toes. The Dorsal interossei muscles are placed between the metatarsal bones; they l'esemble the analogous muscles in the hand in arising by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones ; their tendons are inserted into the base of the first phalanx, and into the digital expansion of the tendons of the long extensor. The First dorsal interosseous is inserted into the inner side of the second toe, and is therefore an adductor ; the other three are inserted into the outer side of the second, third and fourth toes, and are therefore abductors. Communicating arteries (perforantes), between the dor- sum and sole of the foot, pass between the bifid origins of these muscles. The Artery of the dorsum of the foot, Dorsalis pedis, is the continuation of the anterior tibial; it runs along the dorsum of the foot, from the ankle to the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe : here it divides into two branches, the communicating, which passes between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous, and inosculates with the termination of the external plantar artery and the dorsalis hallucis, which runs forwards upon the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and at the base of the first phalanx divides into two branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. Relations.â€” The dorsalis pedis is situated along the outer border of the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis ; on its fibular side is the tendon of the extensor longus digitorum, and near to its termination it is crossed by the inner tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum.

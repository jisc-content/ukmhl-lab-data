414 OPERATION FOR LITHOTOMY. The operator now inserts his finger into the upper part of the incision, drawing aside the bulb of the urethra, and presses his nail into the groove of the staff, just at the point where the urethra escapes from the deep peri- neal fascia : he then conveys the point of a knife, guided by his finger nail, into the groove, at the under part of the cylinder of the urethra, and carries it onwards, along the groove in the staff, into the bladder. In withdrawing the knife he depresses the handle, so as to divide but slightly the neck of the bladder, prostate gland, and deep perineal fascia, and more extensively any of the other textures which may have remained undivided by the first inci- sion. The form of the opening thus made must evidently be triangular, the base being at the integument, the apex at the neck of the bladder. The insertion of the knife into the under part of the cylinder of the urethra, is a pre- caution for avoiding the artery of the bulb *, which might otherwise be divided, and give rise to unpleasant hemorrhage. The Third step in the operation consists in introducing the finger of the right hand through the wound into the bladder, dilating the neck of that viscus, and breaking the prostate gland in the direction of the incision, for the purpose of securing space for the removal of the cal- culus. Then passing the forceps along the finger, the calculus is seized by its short diameter, and must be with- drawn in the axis of the pelvis. The structures cut through in this operation in their order of division, are the Integument, Common superficial fascia, Superficial perineal fascia, Bulbous portion of the accelerator urinae muscle, Transversus perinei muscle, Transversalis perinei artery, Anterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, Membranous portion of the urethra, * The author has seen two or three instances of the early division of this artery, in which no precaution on the part of the surgeon could have availed, and the artery must have been inevitably divided.

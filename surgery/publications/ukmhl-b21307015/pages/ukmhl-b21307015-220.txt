SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 190 lying to its outer side, to the inner border of the first rib, where it unites with the subclavian vein, and forms the vena innominata. On the left side the vein, at its ter- mination, advances rather in front of the artery: on the right it diverges from the artery, leaving a triangular space between them. The internal jugular receives the veins from the deep parts at the base of the skull and neck, and is joined in the submaxillary space by a com- municating branch from thq external jugular, the facial, and occipital veins. Along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle is a small vein, formed by branches from the superficial parts on the front of the neck. It is often of large size, and is named anterior jugular. Subclavian Artery. The Subclavian artery, on the right side (fig. 17. 5.) arises from the arteria in- nominata, 4., opposite the sterno-clavicular articula- tion, and on the left, 10., from the arch of the aorta, 2. The right is consequently shorter than the left, and situated on a plane super- ficial to it. The course of the artery is divided into three por- tions, first, second, and third. The First portion on the right side, 5., passes ob- liquely outwards to the in- * Fig. 17. The arch of the aorta, with its branches, and the course of the subclavian arteries. No. 1.

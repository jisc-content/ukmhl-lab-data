432 CHAPTER XII. ANATOMY OF THE FCETUS. The medium weight of a child of the full period, at birth, is seven pounds; and its length nineteen inches. The head is of large size, and lengthened from before back- wards ; the face small. The upper extremities are greatly developed, and the thorax expanded and full. The upper part of the abdomen is large, from the great size of the liver ; the lower part is small and conical. And the lower extremities are very small in proportion to the rest of the body. The external genital organs are very large, and fully developed. Osseous system. â€” At the earliest term of embryo existence, there is no distinction of structures, the entire body being one homogeneous mass. At a more advanced period, the situation of the bones is distinguishable only by a transparent trace which marks their future position, this is the gelatinous state of ossification. Later than this, the gelatinous trace hardens into cartilage ; the cartila- ginous state. And still later, ossific matter is deposited in the centre of the cartilage ; ossific state. In some instances, Mr. Howship observed that the ge- latinous state passed directly into the ossific state with- out any intermediate cartilaginous transformation. The first point of ossification in the embyro is seen in the clavicle, at the end of the fourth week ; the second occurs at about the same time in the lower jaw. During the sixth week, ossification commences in the femur, humerus, superior maxillary bone, tibia, radius, and ulna. During the seventh and eighth weeks, it appears in the arches of the cervical vertebrae, in the bodies of the dorsal and upper lumbar vertebrae, ribs, expanded portions of the cranial bones, fibula, scapula, ilium, nasal bones, malar, palate, metacarpal, first phalanges, and metatarsal bones.

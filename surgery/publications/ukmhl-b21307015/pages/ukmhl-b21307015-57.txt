FEMORAL ARCH. 27 ject the sheath of the vessels should have been left undisturbed. If now the scalpel be carried along the line of Pou- part’s ligament, cutting through the intervening structures down to the bone, and leaving only the common femoral artery and vein enclosed in their sheath (fig- 3.), it will be seen that Poupart’s ligament, which is extended from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubis, forms a considerable arch over the concave border of the pelvis. This is the femoral arch, and beneath it will be seen to pass a number of important * Fig. 3. A section of the structures which leave the pelvis through the femoral arch ; — the vessels aud their sheath only, being left. No. 1. Poupart’s ligament, the upper boundary of the femoral arch. 2. Its lower boundary, the border of the pubis and ilium. 3. The anterior superior spine of the ilium. 4. The spine of the pubis. 5. The pectineal line of the pubis. 6. The external cutaneous nerve. 7. The iliacus muscle. 8. The crural nerve. 9. The psoas magnus muscle. 10. The crural branch of the genito-crural nerve. 11. The femoral artery. 12. The femoral vein, receiving the internal saphenous vein, which pierces the sheath to open into it. 13. The external portion of the sheath of the femoral vessels, lying in contact with the artery. 14. The large funnel-shaped cavity in the sheath, to the inner side of the vein, which receives the sac of femoral hernia. 15. The femoral ring, bounded in front by Poupart’s ligament, behind by the pubis, externally by the femoral vein, and internally by (1G.) Gimbernat’s ligament. c 2

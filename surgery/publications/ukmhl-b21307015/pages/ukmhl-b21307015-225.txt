INTERNAL MAMMARY. BRANCHES. 195 k 2 to the diaphragm : it then pierces the anterior fibres of the diaphragm, and enters the sheath of the rectus, where it inosculates with the epigastric artery, a branch of the external iliac. The Branches of the internal mammary are,— Anterior intercostal — mammary. Comes nervi phrenici, Mediastinal, Pericardiac, Musculo-phrenic. The Anterior intercostals supply the intercostal spaces on the front part of the chest, and inosculate with the aortic intercostal arteries. They give off several large branches to the mammary gland, which anastomose freely with the thoracic branches of the axillary artery. The Comes nervi phrenici is a long and slender branch which accompanies the phrenic nerve. The Mediastinal and pericardiac branches are small vessels distributed to the anterior mediastinum and pericardium. The Musculo-phrenic artery winds along the attach- ment of the diaphragm to the ribs, supplying it with branches. If we now proceed to an analysis of the distribution of the branches of the subclavian artery, we shall find that two, Internal mammary {Jig. 18. 13.), Superior intercostal, 14., are distributed to the parietes of the thorax; two, Supra-scapular, 12., Posterior scapular, 11., are distributed to the shoulder ; two others, Superficialis cervicis, 9., Profunda cervicis, 10., supply the neck; and, of the remaining two, one is dis- tributed to the thyroid gland, Inferior thyroid, 7., and the other to the spinal cord and brain, Vertebral, 6.

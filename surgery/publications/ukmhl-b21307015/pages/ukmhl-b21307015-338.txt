ORGAN OF TOUCH. THE SKIN. 308 2. The glossopharyngeal, which is distributed to the mucous membrane, follicles, and glands of the tongue, and has been shown by the experiments of Panizza to be the true nerve of taste. This nerve also associates the tongue with the pharynx and larynx. 3. The lingual, which is the motor nerve of the tongue, and is distributed to the muscles. The Mucous membrane, which invests the tongue, is continuous with the cutis along the margins of the lips. On either side of the fraenum linguae, it may be traced through the sublingual ducts into the sublingual glands, and along Wharton’s * ducts into the submaxillary glands ; from the sides of the cheeks it passes through the open- ings of Stenon’s f ducts to the parotid gland ; in the fauces, it forms the assemblage of follicles called tonsils, and may be thence traced downwards into the larynx and pharynx, where it is continuous with the general pulmono-digestive mucous membrane. Beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth are a number of small glandular granules, which pour their secretion upon the surface. A considerable number of them are situated within the lips, in the palate, and in the floor of the mouth. They are named from the position which they may chance to occupy, labial, palatine glands, &c. Organ of Touch. The Skin is composed of three layers : viz. the Cutis, Rete-mucosum, t Cuticle. The Cutis (dermis) or true skin covers the entire sur- face of the body, and is continuous with the mucous mem- brane which lines its cavities. It consists of two layers, a deep one called corium, and a superficial or papillary layer. * Thomas Wharton, an English physician, devoted considerable at- tention to the anatomy of the various glands: his work, entitled “ Adenographia,” &c. was published in 1656. •}• Nicholas Stenon, a Danish anatomist: he was made professor in Copenhagen in 1672.

393 EPIDIDYMIS. s 5 * Fig. 46. The anatomy of the testicle. No. I. The tunica albuginea. 2. The mediastinum testis, or cor- pus Highmorianum. 3. A fibrous cord passing between two of the lobules from the mediastinum to the inner surface of the tunica albu- ginea. Similar cords are observed between the other lobules. 4. The tunica vasculosa or pia mater testis. 5. Two of the lobules of which the substance of the testicle is composed. They are seen to consist of the convolutions of minute tubes, tubuli seminiferi. 6. The small straight tubes by which the tubuli seminiferi terminate, vasa recta. 7. The rete testis, an aggregation of tubuli situated in the anterior half of the mediastinum. The posterior half (8.) is occupied by the arteries and veins. 9. 9. The vasa eflerentia. 10. The coni- cal convolutions of tubuli called coni vasculosi. This portion of the organ being of large size, and situated externally to the testicle, is the globus major of the epididymis. 11. The body of the epididy- mis. 12. The globus minor of the epididymis. 13. The vas de- ferens, ascending to the external abdominal ring. The arrows mark the course of the secretion along the tubes.

OPHTHALMIC ARTERY.— BRANCHES. 215 then crosses the optic nerve, and runs along the inner wall of the orbit to the inner angle of the eye, where it divides into two branches, the frontal and nasal: the latter inosculates very freely with the angular artery. Branches. — Its branches may be arranged into three groups; — 1st, those distributed to the circumference of the orbit; 2d. Muscular branches ; 3d. Branches supply- ing the globe of the eye. 1st. Lachrymal, Supra-orbital, Posterior ethmoidal, Anterior ethmoidal, Palpebral, Frontal, Nasal. 2d. Muscular — anterior ciliary. 3d. Ciliary, Centralis retinae. The Lachrymal is the first branch of the ophthalmic artery, and is usually given off before that artery enters the optic foramen. It follows the course of the lachrymal nerve, along the upper border of the external rectus muscle, and is distributed to the lachrymal gland and upper eyelid. The Supra-orbital artery follows the course of the frontal nerve, resting on the levator palpebrae muscle : it passes through the supra-orbital foramen, and is dis- tributed to the muscles and integument of the forehead. The Ethmoidal arteries, posterior and anterior, pass through the ethmoidal foramina, and are distributed to the ethmoidal cells and nasal fossae. The Palpebral arteries, superior and inferior, encircle the eyelids to which they are distributed. The Frontal artery, one of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic, emerges from the orbit at its inner angle, and |! is distributed upon the middle of the forehead. The Nasal artery, the other terminal branch of the | ophthalmic, distributes a branch to the ridge of the nose, i and inosculates with the angular artery. The Muscular branches, usually two in number, supe-

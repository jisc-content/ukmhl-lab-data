STRUCTURES IN THE ORBIT. 208 A tabular arrangement of these structures will pro- bably enable the student to learn their respective relations with more facility. The plan represents the right orbit.

The student should now commence the examination of the muscles of the orbit; and, in order to render them tense and more easy of dissection, he should inject the globe of the eye with tallow or wax. This is easily done by pushing a probe through the optic nerve into the globe of the eye, in order to break down the cribriform plate of the sclerotic coat, and then inserting an injecting pipe. The Muscles of the orbit are seven : — Levator palpebrae, Superior rectus, Inferior rectus, External rectus, Internal rectus, Superior oblique, Inferior oblique. The Levator palpebra arises from the common tendon. This tendon is common to all the muscles of the orbit, with the exception of the inferior oblique, and is attached

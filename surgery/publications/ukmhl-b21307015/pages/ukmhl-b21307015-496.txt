466 LIGAMENTS OF THE PHALANGES. pezoides, and magnum ; the third with the magnum only ; the fourth with the magnum and unciform ; and the fifth with the unciform bone only; the cipher resulting from this arrangement is 13121. Dislocations of these articulations only occur from great violence, as the bursting of a gun, or the crushing of the hand by a great weight. The kind of displacement depends therefore upon the nature of the injury, and not upon the peculiar conformation of the joint. The metacarpal bone of the thumb may be dislocated from the trapezium, and thrown inwards, so as to rest be- tween the trapezium and the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. TO. The Metacarpo-phalangeal articulation.—The liga- ments of this articulation are four ; the Anterior, Two lateral, Transverse. The Anterior ligaments are thick and almost fibro-car- tilaginous, and form part of the articulating surface of the joints. The Latercd ligaments are strong narrow fasciculi, hold- ing the bones together at each side. The Transverse ligaments are strong ligamentous bands passing between the anterior ligaments, and connecting together the heads of the metacarpal bones of the four fingers. The expansion of the extensor tendon over the back of the fingers takes the place of a posterior ligament. Dislocations The observations upon the dislo- cations of the bases of the metacarpal bones, relate also to their heads. The first phalanx of the thumb may be dislocated back- wards, so as to rest with its base upon the metacarpal bone. This accident is frequently rendered compound by the laceration of the integument. 11. The Articulation of the Phalanges. —The phalanges are articulated with each other by three ligaments; Anterior, Two lateral. The Anterior ligament is firm and fibro-cartilaginous.

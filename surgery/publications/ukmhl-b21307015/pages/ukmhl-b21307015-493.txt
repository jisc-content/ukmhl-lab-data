463 LIGAMENTS OF THE WRIST-JOINT. x 4 cature between the radius and ulna, and is called the membrana sacciformis. By its lower surface it enters into the articulation of the wrist-joint. Dislocations. — The dislocation of these two bones from each other at the upper end, have been indicated in the dislocations occurring at the elbow joint. They are, the displacement of the head of the radius forwards and backwards, and are accompanied with rupture of the an- nular ligament. At the lower end of the two bones the ulna may be separated from the radius by the rupture of the connections of the interarticular fibro-cartilage. 7. The Wrist joint. — The ligaments of the articulation of the wrist are four, the Anterior, Posterior, Internal lateral, External lateral. • The Anterior ligament is a broad membranous layer which passes between the lower part of the radius and ulna, and the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones. The Posterior ligament, also thin and loose, passes be- tween the posterior surface of the radius, and the posterior surface of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones. The Internal lateral ligament extends from the styloid process of the ulna to the cuneiform bone. The External lateral ligament is attached by one ex- tremity to the styloid process of the radius, and by the other to the side of the scaphoid bone and trapezium. The Synovial membrane of the wrist joint lines the under surface of the radius and interarticular fibro-car- tilage above, and the first row of bones of the carpus below. Dislocations. — The dislocations at the wrist-joint are of three kinds : — 1. Of both bones backwards or forwards; a rare acci- dent. 2. Of the radius, forwards. 3. Of the ulna, from its connection with the radius.

225 l 5 MUSCLES. — OPENINGS. The Constrictor superior arises from the extremity of the molar ridge of the lower jaw, from the pterygo-max- illary ligament, and from the lower half of the internal pterygoid plate. Its fibres curve around the pharynx, to ibe inserted into the raphe and basilar process of the occi- pital bone. It is overlapped by the middle constrictor. The upper part of the pharynx, on each side between the base of the skull and the upper curved border of the superior constrictor, is deficient of muscular fibres, being completed only by the mucous membrane. The Stylo-pharyngeus muscle arises from the inner side and base of the styloid process : it descends between the superior and middle constrictor muscles, and is inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is the guide in dissection to the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which runs along its lower border, and crosses it opposite the root of the tongue. Lower down it is in relation with the pharyngeal branch of the pneumogastric nerve, which passes to the middle constrictor to form the pharyngeal plexus. The Palato-pharyngetis is described with the muscles iof the soft palate. It arises from the soft palate, and is inserted into the inner surface of the pharynx. Actions. — The three constrictor muscles contract upon the morsel of food as soon as it is received by the pharynx, and convey it gradually downwards into the oesophagus. The stylo-pharyngei draw the pharynx up- wards and widen it laterally. The palato-pharyngei also draw it upwards, and narrow the opening of the fauces. Interior of the Pharynx. After examining the exterior of the pharynx with its muscles, it should be laid open in order to examine the interior. For this purpose, an incision should be made along the middle line posteriorly, and the sides drawn out and pinned aside. There are seven openings in the pharynx: — Posterior nares, two, Eustachian tubes, two, Mouth, Larynx, (Esophagus.

SUPERFICIAL AND DEEP GROUPS. 95 The Flexor carpi radialis arises from the inner condyle and the sheath of fascia which surrounds it. Its tendon passes through a groove in the scaphoid bone, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. The Palmaris longus muscle arises from the inner con- dyle, and from the sheath of fascia which surrounds it. It is inserted into the palmar fascia. Cut the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus from their origins, in order to obtain a good view of the whole extent of origin of the flexor sublimis digitorum. The Flexor sublimis digitorum (perforatus) arises from the inner condyle, coronoid process of the ulna, and oblique line of the radius. The median nerve and ulnar artery pass between its origins. It divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the base of the second phalanges of the fingers, splitting at their terminations to give passage to the tendons of the deep flexors; thence its designation perforatus. The Flexor carpi idnaris arises by two heads, one from the inner condyle, the other from the olecranon and two thirds of the inner border of the ulna. The ulnar nerve passes between its two heads. Its tendon is inserted into the pisiform bone. Remove the flexor sublimis, and draw the pronator teres upwards with hooks, the deep layer will then be exposed : it consists of the Deep Group. Flexor profundus digitorum, Flexor longus pollicis, Pronator quadratus. The Flexor profundus digitorum (perforans) arises from the upper two thirds of the ulnar and part of the inter- osseous membrane, and terminates in four tendons, which pass beneath the annular ligament, and between the two slips of the flexor sublimis, (hence its designation per- forans), to be inserted into the base of the last phalanges. Four little muscular fasciculi, called lumbricales, are con- nected with the tendons of this muscle in the hand. They will be described with the muscles of the hand.

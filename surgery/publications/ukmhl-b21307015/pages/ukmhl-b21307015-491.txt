LIGAMENTS OF THE ELBOW-JOINT 461 x 3 i tendon of the biceps, which is enclosed in a sheath of synovial membrane in its passage through the joint. Dislocations. — The dislocations of the head of the humerus are four in number:— 1. Dowmvards, and inwards; into the axilla. 1|‘2. Fortoards, under the pectoral muscles. 3. Backwards, on the dorsum of the scapula. 4. Partial, when the anterior part of the capsular liga- ment is torn through, and the head of the bone rests against the coracoid process. 5. Elbow joint.—The ligaments of this articulation are four in number: — Anterior, Posterior, Internal lateral, External lateral. The Anterior ligament is a broad and thin membranous layer, descending from the anterior surface of the hume- rus immediately above the joint, to the coronoid process of the ulna and annular ligament. The Posterior ligament is a broad and loose fold passing between the posterior surface of the humerus to the an- terior surface of the base of the olecranon. The Internal lateral ligament is a thick triangular layer, attached above, by its apex, to the internal condyle of the humerus; and below, by its expanded border, to the margin of the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna, ex- tending from the coronoid process to the olecranon. The External lateral ligament is a strong and narrow band, which descends from the external condyle of the humerus, to be inserted into the annular ligament. The Synovial membrane is extensive, and is reflected from the cartilaginous surfaces of the bones upon the inner surface of the ligaments. Dislocations. — The dislocations occurring at this articulation are Jive in number: — 1. Radius and ulna backwards. 2. Radius and ulna to either side. 3. Ulna backwards. 4. Radius forwards. 5. Radius backwards. This is a very rare accident.

245 LATERAL VENTRICLES. M 3 callosum, is the transverse Jissure of the brain, which extends beneath the hemispheres from the fissure of Sylvius on one side, to that on the opposite side of the brain. It is through this fissure that the pia mater com- municates with the velum interpositum (Jiff- 25. 8.). And it wras here that Bichat conceived that the arachnoid entered into the ventricles ; hence it is also named the Jissure of Bichcit. Along the middle line of the corpus callosum, is the raphe (Jig. 24. 2.), a linear depression between two slightly elevated longitudinal bands ; and, on either side of the raphe, may be seen the linece transverse, which mark the direction of the fibres of which the corpus callosum is composed. The corpus callosum is the commissure of the hemi- spheres. If an incision be made through the corpus callosum on either side of the raph£, two irregular cavities will be opened, which extend, from one extremity of the hemispheres to the other: these are the lateral ventricles. To expose them completely the upper boundary should be removed with the scissors. Each Lateral ventricle is divided into a central cavity, and three smaller cavities called cornua. The anterior cornu projects forwards into the anterior lobe ; the middle cornu descends into the middle lobe; and the posterior cornu passes backwards into the posterior lobe. The central cavity (fig. 24. 3. 3.) is triangular in its form, being bounded above (roof) by the corpus callo- sum. It is separated from the opposite ventricle by the septum lucidum, and its Jloor is formed by the following parts, taken in their order of position from before back- wards : — Corpus striatum, Tenia semicircularis, Thalamus opticus, Choroid plexus, Corpus fimbriatum, Fornix. The Corpus striatum is so named from the striated lines of white and grey matter which are seen upon cutting

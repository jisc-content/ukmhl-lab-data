DIVISION I. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. SECTION I.—INJURIES OF JOINTS. CHAPTER I. DISLOCATIONS: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. DEFINITION.—By the term dislocation is understood a displacement of the ends of the bones which enter into the formation of a joint, so that the articular surfaces no longer maintain their relative positions. The displacement may be partial or complete. By a complete dis- location is meant a complete alteration of the normal relative positions of the articular surfaces of the bones so that the end of one bone over-rides the other; this is most common when the joint affected is of the ball-and- socket variety, but it may occur in almost any joint in the body. In a partial dislocation, on the other hand, there is only an incomplete displace- ment of the articular surfaces—usually lateral—without any over-riding; this is most common in hinge-joints such as the elbow or the knee. CLASSIFICATION.—Dislocations may be classified according to their cause into the following three main groups : 1. Traumatic dislocations, where a healthy joint is dislocated as the result of violence. 2. Pathological dislocations, or those resulting from disease. The chief factor in the production of this form is disease in the joint capsule which gives way and allows displacement of the ends of the bones; examples of this are seen in tuberculous disease, osteo-arthritis, Charcot's disease, etc. 3. Congenital dislocations, which are due either to malformation, to some displacement in uiero, or possibly to violence at or immediately before birth. PT. IV. A

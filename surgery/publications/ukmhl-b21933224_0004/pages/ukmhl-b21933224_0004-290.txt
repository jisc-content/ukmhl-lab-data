CHAPTER XXIV. DISEASES OF THE WRIST AND HAND. DISEASES OF THE WRIST. ACUTE INFLAMMATION. The carpal and radio-carpal joints are comparatively seldom attacked by- acute inflammation, but penetrating wounds may occur and may lead to dangerous suppuration in the irregular synovial cavity, with all the severe general symptoms already described (see Chap. XL). Twists and sprains may lead to a sub-acute form of synovitis, sometimes associated with haemorrhage into the carpal articulations. The wrist joint is also one of the commonest seats of acute and gonorrhoeal rheumatism. In acute and sub-acute inflammations of the wrist, the chief swelling is not so marked in the joint itself as in the tissues around it, especially the tendon sheaths which lie over the dorsal surface and which may become inflamed and distended, and give rise to very marked enlargement. Treatment.â€”In all cases of synovitis of the wrist the proper treat- ment is to fix the joint on a palmar splint arranged so as to throw the carpus and metacarpus backwards; this splint will be more fully described in speaking of tuberculous disease of the joint (see p. 268). In the acute stage also, the application of cold is of considerable value. When the synovitis has followed a sprain, the fixation should not be continued for more than three or four days, as otherwise adhesions may form in the joint and the tendon sheaths in its neighbourhood. Massage should be practised after the second day and should be followed by the use of hot douches and pressure (see p. 93). In all cases, whether the joint be fixed upon a splint or pressure be employed, the fingers should be left free and constantly moved passively and actively. Should there be any difficulty in this, faradisation to the muscles acting upon the fingers may be employed daily. The treatment of other forms of acute inflammation, as well as that of gouty and rheumatoid arthritis, has already been fully described, and pre- sents no points of special importance.

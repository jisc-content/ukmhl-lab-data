C^^AFTER XXVII. KYPHOSIS; SCOLIOSIS. Under this heading are included the forms of spinal curvature which are not due to disease of the vertebrae, in contra-distinction to the disease known as angular curvature or Pott's disease, which is due to a tuberculous affection. Two forms of functional curvature of the spine are met with in practice. The first of these is known as kyphosis, or general curvature of the spine, and although it may in time lead to the second more serious form known as scoliosis, it is, as a rule, transient in nature and easy to treat. We shall therefore deal with this first. * KYPHOSIS. In infancy.â€”This is usually associated with considerable muscular weakness, and also with rickets. As a rule it is merely temporary, and disappears as the child grows stronger. In bad cases, however, especially in those with extensive rickets, the curvature may not disappear, and, as ossification takes place, the child will be round-backed and stooping. The condition, if persistent, is also very likely to become the starting-point of the other and more serious form of curvature of the spine, namely scoliosis, and therefore always requires treatment. A child who is the subject of kyphosis has a constant tendency to sprawl upon the back, and is unable to voluntarily assume the sitting posture. When the child is sat up, the trunk is bunched forward and the spine is strongly bowed backwards, so that the chin often nearly touches the knees. The entire spine is bent forwards into one large C-like curve. There is no want of mobility of the spine, and usually little or no tenderness on pressure. Except in very advanced cases the curvature entirely disappears when the child is laid flat on the back upon a hard level surface. There is no lateral bending of the spine except when the kyphosis has persisted for a considerable time.

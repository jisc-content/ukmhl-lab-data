SUB-SECTION II.—DISEASES OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. CHAPTER XIX. DISEASES OF THE HIP JOINT. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. SIMPLE ACUTE SYNOVITIS.—This is not at all common, but it occasionally follows a sprain or twist, and leads to pain and difficulty in movement. The affection is most frequent in children; in them it is very difficult to be sure that the synovitis is not the preliminary stage of tuberculous disease. The distension of the capsule with fluid is difficult to make out, owing to the depth of the joint from the surface, but on comparing the two groins there is generally some fulness apparent; a similar condition can also be made out behind the trochanter. The position assumed by the limb is one of slight abduction, flexion and outward rotation. Treatment.—The chief essential is rest, and for the first few days the patient should be kept in bed; fomentations should be applied to the region of the joint if there be much pain. It is unnecessary to employ splints or any form of extension. When the pain has passed off, the joint should be moved, and, if there be any stiffness, passive movements and massage will soon put matters right. The patient may be allowed to walk about in a week or ten days. I71 children, in whom it is impossible to be certain that the affection is not early tuberculous disease, it is a good rule to simply put the child to bed and see the case again in a week; should it be simple synovitis- from a strain, the affection will be well on the way to recovery, whereas if it be commencing tuberculous disease the condition will not have improved and will probably be considerably worse. INFECTIVE ARTHRITIS.—Acute or sub-acute mflammation of the hip, sometimes ending in suppuration, occurs in various infective, diseases, such as typhoid fever, gonorrhoea, pyjemia, etc.

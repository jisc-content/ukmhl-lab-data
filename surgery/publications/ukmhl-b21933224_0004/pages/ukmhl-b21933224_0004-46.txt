22 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. easiest method of reduction for those who have but slight experience. The patient is laid flat upon his back on a couch or on the ground, and the surgeon sits down facing the patient on the affected side, and after removing his boot, places his foot in the axilla. The pressure of the foot should be somewhat outwards towards the arm, the object being partly to fix the scapula and partly to provide a fulcrum which will force the head of the bone outwards into its normal position as the traction is made. If the pressure be made too much inwards, the vessels and nerves may be bruised, or indeed the ribs may be fractured. The forearm is seized above the wrist and steady traction is made in a direction downwards and some- what outwards, the surgeon leaning a little away from the patient for the purpose (see Fig. lo). After the traction has been continued long enough to tire out the muscles, the limb is firmly approximated to the side by ^ Fig. to.â€”The Heel-in-Axilla Method of Reducing Dislocations of the Shoulder. First Stage. Steady traction is made downwards and as much outwards as the surgeon can manage by leaning over away from the patient. carrying the forearm nearly to the middle line of the trunk, and the result is that the head of the bone is felt to slip into its normal position (see Fig. ii). In sitb-gle7ioid dislocatiotis, traction, either transversely to the trunk or with the heel in the axilla, very readily brings the head of the bone into position. In the subspinous and the sub-acromial forms, an ancesthetic should always be used if possible; reduction, by traction downwards and forwards is then easy. The arm should be slightly rotated inwards, so as to disengage the lesser tuberosity from the edge of the glenoid cavity, and, after the traction has been continued for some time, the arm should be rotated outwards and carried forwards across the chest; the scapula must be properly fixed by an assistant.

DISLOCATION OF THE SEMILUNAR CARTILAGES. 69 The usual antiseptic dressings are applied, and the limb is placed for a few days on a back splint which is raised upon a pillow. As soon as the wound has healed, which should be in a week or ten days, the stitches may be removed, and passive movements should be begun and should be gradually increased in range. At the same time the spHnt may be taken off, and the patient allowed to move the limb in bed. Massage may also be employed to prevent wasting of the muscles, and after three or four weeks the patient can walk; but he should for the first week or two have the joint supported by an elastic bandage applied over a mass of wool, in order to prevent the slight effusion into the joint which is likely to occur when weight is first borne upon it. At the end of six weeks this may usually be discarded, and from that time onwards it will be found that the mobility of the knee is free and that the patient has lost the constant lia- bility to locking of the joint from which he suffered. The result of these operations, with careful antiseptic precautions, is extremely satisfactory.

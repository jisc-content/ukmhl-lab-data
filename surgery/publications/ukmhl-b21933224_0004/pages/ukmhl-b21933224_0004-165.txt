CHAPTER XV. NERVOUS AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. AFFECTIONS DUE TO ORGANIC LESIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. In certain cases of disease or injury of the spinal cord or tlie main nerve trunks certain peculiar and characteristic affections of the joints are met with which are clearly the result of the nervous lesion, and which, as trophic nerves have not yet been demonstrated in joints, are possibly due to vaso-motor disturbances. These affections are most frequent in connection with locomotor ataxia, when the joint trouble receives the name of " Charcot's Disease." They are also common in cases of syringo-myelia. Joint affections have also been noted in connection with other nervous lesions; they occur in some cases of hemiplegia, after injury to the spinal cord, and particularly in connection with injury or inflam- mation of the main nerve trunk supplying the articulation. In these latter cases the affection usually occurs in the smaller joints such as the fingers, and consists of painful swellings followed by stiffness, and sometimes complete anchylosis, or by more or less complete disorganisation of the articulation. CHARCOT'S DISEASE.—This affection is practically identical with that met with in connection with syringo-myelia. In locomotor ataxia the joints most frequently affected are those of the lower extremity and especially the knee and the hip ; the disease may be monarticular or may affect two or even more joints. It generally occurs at quite an early stage of locomotor ataxia before the onset of the ataxic symptoms. In syringo-myelia, on the other hand, the affection attacks the joints of the upper extremity much more frequently than those of the lower; the shoulder is its most common seat. Pathological chang-es.—Among the most striking features of Charcot's disease are the marked and rapid atrophic changes in the articular ends; the cartilages disappear and the bone beneath often becomes .so destroyed and altered in shape as to entirely alter the

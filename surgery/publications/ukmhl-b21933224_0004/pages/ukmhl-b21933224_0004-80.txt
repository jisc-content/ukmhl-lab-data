THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. 56 (a) Dislocation into the thyroid foramen.—Bigelmv's method.— The patient is anajsthetised and placed fiat upon the back, whilst the pelvis is fixed and the thigh is flexed and abducted sufficiently to disengage the head of the bone from the obturator foramen. The limb is next rotated inwards, strongly adducted and then brought down parallel to its fellow, whilst the inward rotation is kept up (see Fig. 25). This has the effect of fixing the trochanter through the agency of the Y-ligament and the obturator internus tendon, whilst the head of the bone is forced upwards and outwards into the acetabulum. Fio. 25.—Redlction ov a Thyroid Dislocation of the Hii' by Bigeloxv's Method. The l!mb is fully flexed, adducted and rotated inwards, and is finally brought down to the middle line by circumducting it inwards. Reduction by traction.—Should the attempt to reduce the dislocation by manipulation fail, recourse must be had to traction. The patient is fully ancesthetised, and placed upon the floor or upon a low couch. The sur- geon flexes the thigh to a right angle with the pelvis, and first of all slightly abducts it so as to disengage the head of the bone. A strong jack- towel is then passed transversely around the upper part of the thigh, and whilst an assistant fixes the pelvis, the surgeon makes extension vertically- upwards with the limb rotated somewhat inwards, a second assistant pulling upon the towel so as to drag the head of the bone directly outwards (see Fig. 26). The result of the combined traction is that the head of the bone passes into the acetabulum. Should the surgeon fail to reduce the dislocation by either of the methods just described, the best thing is to convert the dislocation into one upon the dorsum ilii. This can generally be readily done by flexing the limb

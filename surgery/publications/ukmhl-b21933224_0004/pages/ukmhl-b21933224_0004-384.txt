360 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE. Treatment.â€”The removal of these tumours is always a very serious matter on account of the great risk of sepsis owing to their close con- nection with the anus; unless, therefore, they are doing harm, it is well to avoid interfering with them, at any rate until the patient is grown up. When removal is undertaken, special pains must be taken not to open into the rectum, which it is very easy to do, owing to the connection of the tumour with that structure. It must always be borne in mind that there may be a free communication between the tumour and the spinal canal, and consequently the cerebro-spinal fluid may escape during the operation.

CHAPTER V. DISLOCATIONS OF THE WRIST AND FINGERS. DISLOCATIONS OF THE WRIST. Dislocation of the carpus from the radio-ulnar arch is of very rare occur- rence, as the force necessary to produce it is far more Hkely to cause a Colles's fracture. Dislocation may occur either forwards or backwards, the latter being the more common form, and the injury usually results from heavy falls or violent blows upon the outstretched palm, the hand being forcibly bent backwards and the wrist joint over-extended. The condition is difficult to diagnose from Colles's fracture, with which it is often con- founded ; the points of diagnostic importance are the maintenance of the normal relative positions of the styloid processes and the absence of any displacement of the hand to the radial side in dislocation. Treatment.â€”This is usually quite easy, and can be carried out without an anaesthetic. The dislocation is readily reduced by traction, which brings the articular surfaces into contact, and there is but little tendency to recur- rence of the deformity. It is well to lay the hand upon an anterior splint for a few days and to employ the ordinary evaporating lotions (see Part I., p. 8), as there is often considerable effusion into the joint and the tendon sheaths around it. Massage should be practised from the first. The splint may be left off in about a week and the arm kept in a sling for two or three weeks longer, whilst massage and passive movement are persevered with. The result is usually quite satisfactory. DISLOCATIONS OF THE CARPAL BONES. Di.slocation of one carpal bone from another, although sometimes met with, is of such extreme rarity that the accident does not require any special mention; it usually occurs in connection with cru.shes of the hand or run-over injuries, and, under these circumstances, it is usually best to remove the displaced bone.

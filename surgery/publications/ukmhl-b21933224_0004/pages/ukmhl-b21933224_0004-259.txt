DISEASES OF THE ANKLE AND TARSUS. 235 removed, and the surface of the bone beneath gouged. Should there be any pits or depressions in the cartilage, they should be enlarged and bone deposits beneath them looked for. After the joint has thus been cleared out, the parts are replaced, the joint cavity is filled with iodoform and glycerine and the wound stitched up without a drainage tube. The usual cyanide dressings are applied, with which may be incorporated perforated block-tin or wire netting splints (see p. 73); outside these a large mass of wool is put on.

After-treatment.—The dressings should be changed in a fortnight, when the wound should be healed, and the stitches may be removed. The limb may now be put up in plaster of Paris, taking care to keep the foot strictly in its normal position. The plaster casing should be maintained for about six weeks, when it should be renewed. The patient should not be allowed to walk until six or eight months have elapsed from the time of the operation. Results.—The chief trouble after arthrectomy of the ankle is the tendency to lateral deviation of the foot—more particularly inversion—and this must be carefully guarded against by the use of apparatus until the parts have become quite firm. Afterwards the patient must wear a suitable boot designed to prevent lateral displacement (see* Fig. 32). There is no fear of the mobility of the hmb becoming impaired, even though the joint be kept in plaster for as long as six months, because the os calcis does not unite firmly to the tibia and a very excellent movable joint results.

THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. i6 spontaneously reduced itself. When, however, no anaesthetic is at hand, the pain that the patient suffers may be so severe as to demand immediate reduction without waiting. The best method of reduction for dislocation downwards or forwards is by manipulation; the particular method of manipulation that is most generally useful is that introduced by Kocher and usually called by his name. It is performed as follows: Kocher's method.—^^'hen the patient is not under an anaesthetic he sits bolt upright in a chair, and an assistant steadies the trunk and fixes Fig. 3.—Kocher's Method of Reducing Dislocations of thk Shoulder. Fiist Stage. The trunk is firmly fi.ved by a stout towel pas.sed round the back of a chair and held by an assistant. The elbow is then fle.\ed to a right angle and firmly approximated to the chest-wall. the scapula, either with his hands or with a towel passed around the body. It is most essential that not only the scapula but the entire trunk- should be steadied during the manipulations, as otherwise the patient may,- by swaying the body about, defeat them entirely. A good plan is to fasten the trunk to the back of a strong chair by means of a stout jack-towel. The surgeon stands or kneels a little in front of the patient on the affected side, and first of all flexes the fore-arm to a right angle and then steadily approximates the elbow to the side (see Fig. 3). This stretches the upper part of the capsule and causes the head of the bone to hitch against the

DISEASES OF THE SHOULDER JOINT. 253 of the biceps must be looked out for below, and will readily come into view if the arm be slightly rotated outwards. The biceps tendon should be carefully freed from its sheath, and pulled aside if it be healthy; if, however, the disease extends down the bicipital groove it must be carefully dissected out. The finger is then passed beneath the deltoid, which is raised from the muscles beneath and pulled forcibly outwards. Should the deltoid bursa be affected, its remains must be carefully dissected out, whilst the arm is fully abducted and the under surface of the muscle rendered accessible by everting it. The front part of the capsule is defined and isolated from the structures in front of it, and the portion thus separated may be clipped away with scissors. The arm is now carried backwards so as to hang over the table, and pushed up so as to protrude the head of the bone (see Fig. 69), when the muscles attached to the tuberosities must be partially or entirely divided. In most cases enough bone can be removed without complete division of the rotators, as a bone section about the level of the anatomical neck or just below it usually sufifices. If, however, there be a deposit in the greater tuberosity, that structure must Fig. 68.—Incision for Ex- cision OF THE Shoulder.

The soft parts are protected by n fle.\ible copper spatula -suitably bent, and the saw is applied as shown above.

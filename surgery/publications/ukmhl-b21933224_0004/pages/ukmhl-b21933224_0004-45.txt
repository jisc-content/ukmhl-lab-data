DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. 21 Traction methods.—In mu.scular subjects, however, Kocher's method is not always successful without an anresthetic; and if it fail, some form of traction must be resorted to. Ouhvard traction.—The method that seems to combine the most satisfactory results with the least pain to the patient and bruising of the parts is the following:—The patient is laid flat upon the back on the ground or on"a low couch, and the surgeon sits or kneels beside him ; the fore-arm is flexed to a right angle, and traction is made so as to bring the arm gradually out from the side until it is at right angles to the trunk. An assistant, if available, makes counter-extension by means of a jack-towel Fig. 9.—The Right-angled Traction Method of Reducing Dislocations of THE Shoulder. If no assistant be available the surgeon may exert coiinier-exiension by his unbooted foot against the axillary border of the scapula. passed transversely around the upper part of the chest, while the surgeon keeps up steady traction at right angles to the body (see Fig. 9). If no assistant be present, the surgeon must sit upon the floor at right angles to liis patient and place his unbooted foot against the scapula so as to fix it while he makes the traction. Sometimes the head of the bone is felt to slip in with a jerk, but most commonly it does so very gradually, .so that, after the traction has been continued until the muscles are tired out and the parts are fully relaxed, the surgeon finds that the dislocation has been reduced when the arm is brought to the side. If plenty of a.ssistance be at hand, the extension and counter-extension can be entrusted to assistants while the surgeon manipulates the head of the bone into place as the muscles become tired out. Downward traction.—The older method was to reduce the dislocation by means of the heel in the axilla. This no doubt is very effectual and should be resorted to if the other methods fail; it is also probably the

CHAPTER II. DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. Either end of the clavicle may be dislocated; the acromial is the one more frequently affected. DISLOCATIONS OF THE ACROAIIAL END. Strictly speaking this is really dislocation of the scapula from the clavicle. Although more frequent than dislocation of the sternal end, the injury is still far from common. It is usually caused by falls or blows upon the back or outer side of the shoulder, which push the scapula forwards. Falls or blows upon the point of the shoulder, on the other hand, are more prone to produce fracture. DISPLACEMENT.—The acromial end of the clavicle almost invariably projects above the acromion process of the scapula, whilst the latter is displaced somewhat forwards and downwards; there is generally a slight dropping of the shoulder. Cases have, however, been met with where the clavicle has been displaced below the acromion, and in some exceedingly rare cases it has even been found below the coracoid process. TREATMENT. —(a) Of dislocation upwards.—As a rule this is very difficult and somewhat unsatisfactory. Reduction of the dislocation is perfectly easy; it is only necessary to carry the shoulder forcibly back- wards and upwards, to push up the elbow and to press down the acromial end of the clavicle. This brings the articular surfaces into good position; but the difficult part of the treatment is to maintain the reduction while repair is taking place. A certain amount of deformity is almost certain to recur, and this will be permanent. Fortunately, however, it rarely interferes at all with the usefulness of the limb, and heavy manual labour can often be performed as well as ever, even with a considerable deformity; occasionally, on the other hand, there may be much interference with the patient's work. Splints.—The point of greatest difficulty in the treatment is that, however

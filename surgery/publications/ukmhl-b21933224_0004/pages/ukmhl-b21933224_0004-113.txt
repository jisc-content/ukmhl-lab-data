89 WOUNDS. (see Fig. 33). The fluid, which should be at the body temperature, should only be allowed to travel slowly through the tubes, and if necessary the nozzle should be disconnected from time to time and attached to different drainage tubes so as to effectually flush out the whole of the joint. It is important in irrigating joints to avoid the use of antiseptics which coagulate albumen, and the best lotions are very weak solutions of permanganate of potash, sanitas, or tincture of iodine. Fig. 33.—Constant Irrigation afplieu to the Knee Joint. The nozzle of the irrigator is inserted into one end of the supra-patellar drainage tube and a constant flow is thus maintained through the joint. The fluid is conducted by means of a mackintosh, appropriately arranged as above, into a suitable receptacle. For the sake of clearness, the splint fixing the joint has been omitted. The water-bath.—When irrigation cannot be practised the limb should be immersed in a water-bath (see Part I., p. 32) containing one of the fluids just mentioned. The limb should be kept in the bath night and day, and should only be taken out for the purpose of cleaning out the bath. Should it be impossible to employ either irrigation or the water-bath, the next best treatment is to use the ordinary cyanide gauze dressings, for a certain amount of benefit will be derived from the disinfection of the discharge that occurs in them, although the wound itself is widely infected. The dressings should be changed at first twice daily, and later on, when the discharge decreases, once a day. When this method is employed it is, as a nile, unnecessary to wash out the joint each time the dressings are changed; it may be done if preferred, but care should be taken to avoid

DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. 57 and then forcibly circumducting it inwards. Indeed, it commonly happens during the attempts to reduce the dislocation that the head of the bone slips past the lower margin of the acetabulum and travels round upon the dorsum of the ilium. When a dorsal dislocation has thus been produced, reduction can readily be effected by the manipulations already described (see p. 52). Fic;. 26.—Reduction of a Thyroid Dislocation by Traction. This closely resembles the traction method for the dorsal dislocations, except that a second assistant makes traction outwards at right angles to the long axis of the femur with a towel passed round the limb, so as to pull the head of the bone outwards from the thyroid foramen. (b) Pubic dislocation.—In this form it is well in any case to com- bine manipulations with traction, as there is generally some diflficulty in fully flexing the thigh, owing to the neck of the bone hitching against the brim of the pelvis. The patient should be placed under an anesthetic, and the thigh flexed as far as possible and somewhat abducted so as to disengage the head of the bone from the brim of the pelvis. Outward traction is then applied by the agency of a jack-towel passed transversely around the upper third of the thigh so as to pull the head of the bone downwards and outwards and to disengage it from the pubes. When this has been done, the limb can be more fully flexed, and it should be then still further abducted and rotated inwards, which completes the disengagement of the head. The lateral traction may now be relaxed, and the dislocation can be reduced by rotating and circumducting the limb inwards, and finally bringing it down parallel with the sound limb as for reduction of thyroid dislocations. This plan of combining manipulation and traction aims at converting the pubic dislocation into the thyroid form by disengaging the

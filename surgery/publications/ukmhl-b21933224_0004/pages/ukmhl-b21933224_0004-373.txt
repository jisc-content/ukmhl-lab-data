TUBERCULOUS DISEASE. 34^ support. When the disease is in the lumbar or dorso-lumbar regions, and IS not extensive, Sayre's plaster of Paris jacket, put on while the patient is suspended from the tripod in the ordinary way acts fairly well; when a removable apparatus is desired, a poroplastic jacket is a fairly efficient substitute. They are not however at all equal in value to the various forms of "braces," and should only be used when the latter cannot be obtained. Braces.—The idea that these jackets act by lifting up the thorax from the pelvis is erroneous; they really act by preventing the upper part of the spine from falling forwards, and this is much more effectually done by the forms of apparatus spoken of by the Americans as braces, of which Taylor's brace is one of the best. It must be remembered that the articular pro- Fii;. 135.—Taylor's Brace. The instrument is seen before application, a is the spinal support, b the apron, and c is Dr. Taylor's chest-piece.

The principle of the brace is to place a bar on each side of the spine, having their fixed points at the pelvis, and their fulcrum at the seat of the disease, and then by an apron over the front of the thorax to pull back the upper part of the spine, or at any rate to prevent it from falling forwards. Taylor's brace.—We may quote the description of Taylor's brace from Bradford & Lovett's Orthopcedic Surgery :—" In the first place, a tracing of

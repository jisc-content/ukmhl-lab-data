47 DISLOCATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. embraces it. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is flexed into the palm and firmly fixed by one hand whilst the thumb is grasped with the other and hyper-extended almost to a right angle, whilst traction is at the same time maintained (see Fig. 17). The object of this is to try to disengage the Fig. 17.—Method of Reducing a Dislocation of the Thumb. First Sia«e. With the left hand the metacarpal hone is pressed well down into the palm while firm downward pressure is exerted by the thumb against the base of the phalanx which is hyper-extended by the right hand. anterior edge of the base of the phalanx from the posterior aspect of the head of the metacarpal. It is often difficult to apply sufficient traction with the unaided fingers, but considerable help may be got either by a clove-hitch around the thumb or by special forceps invented for the purpose (see Fig. 19). When sufficient traction in the hyper-extended position has been applied, the base of the phalanx is firmly pushed forwards and the thumb is rapidly flexed into the palm (see Fig. 18). This relaxes the flexor brevis poUicis by adducting the thumb, and the extension applied to the phalanx brings the orifice through which the head of the metacarpal bone has passed opposite to the head again, when, by continuing the extension and suddenly flexing the joint, the head may pass back through the aperture and come into position. Frequently, however, it is found impossible to reduce these dislocations

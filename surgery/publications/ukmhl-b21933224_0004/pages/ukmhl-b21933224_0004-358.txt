Right side to machine ; arm straight out grasping handle is carried upwards t.o side of head ; returns to first position, pauses, and is brought down to side ; reverse ; repeat. 2. Left side to machine ; same exercise for left arm. Fig. 115. 3. Right side to machine ; left forearm resting on head, left hand over right ear grasping handle (see Fig. 115). Patient leans as far as possible towards machine, recovers and leans as far as possible away from it ; hips and legs immovable (see Fig. 116). 4. Repeat with left side to machine, right arm over head. 5. Repeat 3, with a circular instead of a to-and-fro move- ment. 6. Repeat 4, with a circular instead of a to-and-fro move- ment. Note.—It will be seen that most of the exercises with Uowd's machine are chiefly the previous e.xercises performed with apparatus. The machine simply is. an accurate means of adding increasing resistance by putting more weights on to the carrier. The same remarks apply more or less to all the developing machines hereafter mentioned. Fig. 116. Series M.—Exercises with, a Single Dowd's Machine, the Rope passing under a Pulley attached to the Floor. (Face to Machine.) 1. Right arm obliquely in front holding handle. Raise to the vertical by side of head without bending arm. 2. Left arm ditto.

CHAPTER XXI. DISEASES OF THE ANKLE AND TARSUS. Very little need be said concerning the non-tuberculous affections of these joints; their treatment has already been fully described in speaking of the diseases in general, and only a few words concerning the special forms of apparatus, etc., will be necessary. ACUTE ARTHRITIS. VARIETIES.—This may be either suppurative—when it is most com- monly either of pyasmic origin or is secondary to osteo-myelitis—or it may be non-suppurative—when it either results from an injury such as a sprain, or is associated with some general disease such as rheumatism, gout, or gonorrhoea; the latter affection is extremely common in the ankle and tarsus, where it is one of the commonest causes of acute flat-foot. The most common seat of acute osteo-myelitis occurring about the foot is the OS calcis, but fortunately the disease here generally gives rise to an abscess which finds its way externally rather than into the neighbouring joints. It usually takes the form of acute epiphysitis, so that the principal focus of disease is situated in the immediate neighbourhood of the posterior epiphyseal line, and necrosis may occur in that situation. Sometimes the calcaneo-astragaloid or calcaneo-cuboid articulation may become affected; there is then generally necrosis of the entire os calcis. TREATMENT.—This will vary considerably according to whether—(a) there is no suppuration in the joint, {b) there is suppuration, or {c) there is also acute osteo-myelitis of the os calcis. When there is no suppuration in the ankle-joint.—Absolute rest of the joint should be provided. It is important to remember that there is a constant tendency to pointing of the toes when the ankle joint is fixed, and this must be carefully avoided, as it would inevitably cause difficulty in restoring the foot to its proper position. It can easily be guarded against by seeing that the foot is kept strictly at right angles to

CHAPTER XXII. DISEASES OF THE SHOULDER JOINT. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. ACUTE AND CHRONIC SYNOVITIS with effusion are compara- tively rare in the shoulder, and the condition may be readily overlooked if the distension of the capsule be only slight; when it is considerable, the swelling is most marked beneath the anterior edge of the deltoid, and the upper arm is slightly abducted and somewhat internally rotated; fluctuation may sometimes be felt in the axilla. These forms of serous synovitis are mainly produced by injuries such as twists or dislocations; in the latter case the distension is first due to blood, and subsequently to serous effusion. The treatment of this condition follows lines similar to those already described for acute and chronic synovitis (see Chap. XII.), and presents no points of special interest. ACUTE SUPPURATION occurs as a result of penetrating wounds or as a complication of acute epiphysitis of the upper end of the humerus; in the latter affection the joint is very readily affected. The treatment is identical with that for similar affections elsewhere (see p. 94). TUBERCULOUS DISEASE. Tuberculous disease of the shoulder is not uncommon and is mainly met with in adult life, being most frequent between the ages of twenty and thirty. As in the other joints, the disease may be primary in the synovial membrane or the bone, more commonly the latter. The primary osseous deposits occur most frequently in the great tuber- osity of the humerus, and much less commonly about the neck of the scapula. In some cases the acromion process may be the primary seat of the mischief, but when this bone is affected it is usually secondary to

THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE. for longer at a time and at least twice a day. Many useful ones will be found in the Appendix. Another method also of considerable value in these cases is the sus- pension of the patient from two parallel trapeze bars, one being a few inches higher than the other. The lower bar, which should be just high enough to Hft the patient from the feet, is grasped by the hand on the side of the convexity of the curve whilst the upper one is grasped by the opposite hand. The patient may be taught either to swing upon this or merely to hang free of the ground. The object of the treatment is to allow the whole weight of the body to tell upon the spine and thus to open out the curvature ; for moderately severe cases this is an extremely useful method, especially when combined with the exercises recommended above. Fig. 83.—"Rachii.ysis" APPLIED in thk Standing Position. Tlie patient stands with the side of the concavity of the curve to be treated against the wall. She is then made to hold weights or to go through set exercises after ihe padded sling has been .npplied to the summit of the convexity. Sometimes the surgeon attempts to forcibly unfold the curve by traction (compare also Fig. 84). " Rachilysis."—A method termed " Rachilysis " has been introduced by Mr. Barwell with the object of mechanically and forcibly unfolding the curves of the spine. Theoretically it is a very promising method although in practice its objects are not always very easy to obtain, but it is valuable in the more severe cases and should always be tried. It consists in passing a broad padded sling, the ends of which are fastened to a hook in the wall about the level of the patient's head, around the convexity of the

CHAPTER XXIX. SPONDYLITIS DEFORMANS : ACUTE OSTEO-MYELITIS : ACTINOMYCOSIS : NEW GROWTHS OF THE SPINE : HYSTERICAL SPINE: SACRO-COCCYGEAL TUMOURS. SPONDYLITIS DEFORMANS. This is the name given to chronic rheumatoid arthritis of the spine, which usually occurs in persons past middle age. In it there are alterations in the articular surfaces similar to those found in other joints, and likewise outgrowths around the margin of the intervertebral discs. Osteophytic outgrowths also occur in connection with the transverse processes and the bodies, and there is a tendency to ossification of the ligaments and anchy- losis of the vertebrae. The spine usually assumes a uniform kyphotic curve forwards, and is rigidly fixed. Symptoms.—The symptoms are mainly great pain and rigidity, the pain not being limited to the spine itself, but running down the course of any nerves which may be pressed upon as they pass out of the spinal canal. Treatment.—The condition is a very hopeless one. There is no special form of treatment for the spinal affection; it must be on the lines already detailed (see p. 151) for rheumatoid arthritis elsewhere. ACUTE OSTEO-MYELITIS. This is an extremely rare affection, and, beyond pointing out the possi- bility of its occurrence, we need say very little about it. The condition is more often fatal even than it is in the long bones, possibly on account of the large amount of medullary tissue in the bodies of the vertebrte ; sometimes, however, cases recover if the condition be diagnosed and the pus evacuated sufficiently early. Only a very few of these cases are on record.

SECTION IL—DISEASES OF JOINTS. SUB-SECTION I.—DISEASES OF JOINTS IN GENERAL. CHAPTER XII. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. Inflammation of joints may be either acute or chronic, and the process may involve one or all of the structures entering into the composition of the articulation. ACUTE INFLAMMATION. Acute inflammation may affect either the synovial membrane alone— when it receives the name of acute synovitis; or the whole of the structures of the joint—when it is generally spoken of as acute arthritis. ACUTE SYNOVITIS.—Acute synovitis may be due to various causes, such as injury, gonorrhoea, specific fevers, rheumatism, etc. Its chief characteristic is rapid effusion into the articular cavity accompanied by considerable pain. The joint becomes distended with fluid, and the skin in superficial joints may be reddened; frequently, however, it is only slightly more vascular than that over the corresponding joint on the opposite side, but it is generally warmer to the touch. There is considerable pain on pressure over the inflamed joint, although movement or jarring one bone against the other is generally easily borne. The presence of fluid in the joint is a constant and marked feature. At first this fluid is readily coagulable, a character which it loses later on. The affection may subside, in which case the effusion that has been poured out becomes absorbed. On the other hand, the affection may become chronic, in which case the effusion loses its coagulable character and is poured out in an increasingly large quantity, until the cavity of the joint becomes distended with serous fluid and the capsule considerably

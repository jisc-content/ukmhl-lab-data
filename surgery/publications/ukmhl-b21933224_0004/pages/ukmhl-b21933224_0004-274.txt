250 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. tuberculous disease of the deltoid bursa. When the deposit reaches the surface of the bone, it is not uncommon for the deltoid bursa to be distended and to give rise to a soft fluctuating swelling beneath that muscle often containing rice-like bodies, which manifest themselves by their peculiar creaking sensation on manipulation. In the early stages of the disease there is increased fulness about the shoulder, with thickening to be felt in'the axilla, and some considerable limitation of movement of the arm, which is kept slightly abducted and rotated inwards. In the later stages there is very marked pain on move- ment, the arm being kept rigidly applied to the side and considerably rotated inwards, whilst abscesses form and point in front of or behind the deltoid. It is not uncommon to find an abscess travelling along the bicipital groove and coming to the surface beneath the skin about the centre of the front of the arm. In other cases it may open into the axilla, and sometimes about the lower limit of the posterior border of the deltoid. TREATMENT.—The same general rules must guide the surgeon in ^ the treatment of tuberculous shoulder joint disease as in the case of tuber- culous joint disease elsewhere. There are, however, certain points special to this joint which may be remarked upon here. Fig. 66.—Ai'PARATUs for use in Tuberculous Pisease of the Shoulder. The wedge-shaped cushion is fixed in position by the straps shown in the figure. The .ipparatus is fully described in the text. (a) Expectant.—The first point of importance is the advisability of employing expectant methods. It must be remembered that recovery from the disease in this situation is followed by stiffness of the joint,

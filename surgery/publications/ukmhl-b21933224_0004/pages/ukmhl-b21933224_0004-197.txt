DISEASES OF THE HIP JOINT. 173 Thomas's original directions for the application of this splint are as follows:—I. The initial act should be to place the machine so far posteriorly that it is just out of sight behind the buttock when the patient is lying horizontal. 2. The machine should be pushed upwards until the upper wings are close to the patient's axillae. 3. An assistant should grasp the patient's leg, together witii the lower part of the main stem, to hinder the machine from slipping downwards while the operator is manipulating, that is to say, twisting it so as to fit properly. 4. The Fk;. 38.—Thomas's Hii" Si-lint. A shows the splint previous to use; the wings « surround the leg just below the knee, while those at i enclose the thigh well above it. The stout metal band c encircles the chest, and the splint is kept in place partly by bandages and partly by the braces rf. B is the patten fastened to the boot on the sound siile by the screw plates e. The apparatus is shown applied in C, with the patient walking on crutches. surgeon should proceed first to closely fit the wings which grasp the sound side of the trunk, thigh and leg, and afterwards the outer wings are adjusted. 5. The shoulder braces are to be adjusted; afterwards the thigh and leg bandages. When flexion is present at the time that fhe splint is applied, no attempt should be made to draw the leg forcibly into the straight position. It should be allowed to remain in the position which is comfortable to the patient, and in the course of a few days the weight of the limb itself which is left' unsupported behind the knee will gradually bring the leg straight. Sometimes there is considerable pain for a day or two after the splint

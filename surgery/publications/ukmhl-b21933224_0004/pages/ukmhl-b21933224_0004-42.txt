Although for the sake of clearness these manipulations have been described in stages, the process is a continuous one in practice and should be carried out rapidly and forcibly. It is important to their success that the trunk should be carefully fixed by the assistant. Fig. 5.â€”Kocher's Method of Reducing Dislocations of the Shoulder. Third Stase. While full outward rotation is maintained, the arm is carried upwards parallel to the antero-posterior plane of the body until it is almost horizontal.

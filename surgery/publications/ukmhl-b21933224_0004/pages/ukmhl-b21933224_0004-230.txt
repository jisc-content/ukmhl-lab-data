THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. 206 to sit up in bed is accompanied by contraction of the thigh muscles, and this keeps up a state of unrest in the joint. In a child the re- cumbent position may be enforced by placing a sheet across the trunk and rolling up heavy sand-bags in either end of it. If, after about two months of this treatment, the condition be improving or at any rate not extending, the limb may be put up in an immovable apparatus; it is well not to use this in the early stage for fear of abscesses occurring beneath the splint. The best arrangement is to put the limb up in a silicate or plaster of Paris bandage from the toes to the groin. A bandage of boracic lint is first applied round the limb, and outside Fic. 52.â€”Thomas's Knee Splint. As the weight of the body is borne on the oval ring which supports the pelvis, no pressure is allowed to fall upon the knee. The left hand figure is a sketch of the splint, and patten for the sound limb, before application. this two or three layers of firm woven bandage soaked in a solution of silicate of potash are applied. The silicate bandage is much lighter than the plaster of Paris, and for the present purpose is equally efficient; whenever available, it should be used in preference to the plaster. If the patient be allowed to get about, the limb, enclosed in the silicate bandage, may be placed in a Thomas's knee splint (see Fig. 52). It is customary to use Thomas's knee splint alone for this purpose, but it does not seem to us that the leg is sufficiently fixed unless some form of immobilising bandage be employed, as the splint does not grasp the leg well and considerable mobility is possible. The combination of the two

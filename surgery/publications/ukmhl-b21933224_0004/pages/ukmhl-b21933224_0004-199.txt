DISEASES OF THE HIP JOINT. When the flexion is extreme, some extension must be made before applying Thomas's splint; this, however, must never be applied in the horizontal direction to a flexed limb as it would cause great pain, and might considerably increase the muscular spasm. It is quite easy to make extension in the direction that the limb has already assumed. When the flexion is considerable, the pulley over which extension is being made must be raised sufficiently for the cord passing from the limb to the Fig. 40.â€”A Douhle Thomas's Splint for Hip Disease. The splint, wliich is made of malleable iron thickly padded with leather, is shown applied in the following Figure. The leg-pieces diverge, so as to abduct the lower extremities. pulley, to run very much in the direction of the limb itself (see Fig. 39). In two or three days, the pulley may be lowered so as to diminish the amount of flexion slightly, and this can be continued as the limb comes down, until finally the horizontal position is reached. When there is very marked adduction^ or when the patient is a rest- less child, a single Thomas's splint is not sufficient, and it is better to employ ^/le double form (see Fig. 40), which consists of a bar running up behind each buttock and leg, thence along each side of the spine, the two being connected by cross-pieces above and opposite the pelvis. The bars should diverge from each other, so that, when fixed to them, the

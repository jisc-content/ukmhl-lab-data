CHAPTER IV. DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW, The elbow joint is frequently dislocated, and the accident commonly occurs before the age of sixteen. This is probably due to the fact that the coronoid process is then of comparatively small size, and, as it has not completely ossified, it may be very readily separated from the ulna. Dislocation may take place backwards, forwards, inwards, or outwards, and besides these typical forms, the bones of the fore-arm may be displaced in two directions at once, the most frequent being dislocation backwards and inwards and dislocation backwards and outwards. Besides dislocation of both bones of the fore-arm together, either bone may be dislocated separately. The radius, if dislocated alone, may pass either backwards, outwards, or forwards, whilst if the ulna alone be displaced it is dislocated backwards. DISLOCATION OF BOTH BONES OF THE FORE-ARM. In the majority of cases when both bones are dislocated they are dis- placed directly backwards, but in some cases an inward or an outward displacement may be combined with this. All the other forms of displace- ment, i.e. directly inwards, directly outwards or forwards, are very rare. DISLOCATION OF BOTH BONES BACKWARDS.â€”As a rule this injury is caused by a fall upon the hand with the elbow fully extended and the fore-arm supinated. The result is that the elbow is hyper-extended, and the anterior and the internal lateral ligaments are ruptured and allow the coronoid process to slip back over the lower end of the humerus, and thus the bones of the fore-arm become dislocated backwards. In some cases, however, fracture of the coronoid process, or, more frequently, detachment at its epiphyseal line, occurs. The head of the radius passes backwards along with the ulna, the radio-ulnar articulation being uninjured. The extent to which the bones are displaced backwards depends upon the damage done to the external lateral ligament, and to the tendon I'T. IV. c

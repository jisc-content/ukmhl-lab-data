CHAPTER XXIII. DISEASES OF THE ELBOW JOINT. INFLAMMATION OF THE BURSA BENEATH THE BICEPS TENDON. An affection of some importance is inflammation of the bursa between the tendon of the biceps and the tubercle of the radius. This bursa Hes very deep and it is seldom that it gives rise to any definite swelling, even when it is markedly distended; the symptoms are therefore often very vague and the diagnosis consequently difficult. AVhen the bursa is much distended it is apt to be mistaken for a solid tumour. A characteristic point in the diagnosis is the occurrence of pain when the elbow is bent with the fore-arm fully supinated, whereas there is little or no pain when the limb is pronated. This arises from the fact that in the former case the biceps action alone is called into play, whilst in the latter the brachialis anticus is the most important agent. There is also special tenderness on pressure just over the bicipital tuberosity, and the pain is increased by rolling the biceps tendon laterally over the bursa, and by alternate pronation and supination. Treatment.—The treatment consists of rest on a rectangular splint which throws the biceps out of action. After a short time devoted to this method, moderate elastic compression and massage are of considerable value, but in persistent cases it may be necessary to aspirate the bursa, following this up by elastic pressure with cotton wool and a bandage. ACUTE SUPPURATION. This affection usually occurs after septic penetrating wounds of the joint, and disorganisation of the articulation with all its accompanying risks soon follows. Treatment.—The joint should be opened freely by incisions on either side of the olecranon, with drainage from the front, followed, if the case be acute, by continuous irrigation (see p. 88). PT. IV. R

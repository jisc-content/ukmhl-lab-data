l6o THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. strapping, and a pad may be fixed over it so as to prevent it from slipping whilst the anfesthetic is being administered; during disinfection of the skin the fixation should be seen to by an assistant. A curved incision is made, a flap of skin and subcutaneous tissue is thrown back and the capsule incised directly over the loose body. Before the incision through the capsule is made, care must be taken to arrest all bleeding, as otherwise blood may find its way into the joint and give rise to troublesome adhesions afterwards. Before making the incision into the capsule it is well to thrust a needle firmly into the cartilage so as to fix it, lest it slip away as the incision is made. When the capsule has been opened, a sharp hook is inserted into the cartilage, which is then pulled out. The incision in the capsule is accurately stitched up with fine catgut, and the flap sutured in place without a drainage tube. The whole opera- tion should be carried on under an irrigation of 1-8000 sublimate solution. When, however, as sometimes happens, the cartilage escapes into the joint at the moment of incision, a very useful manoeuvre is to flush the joint out with a 1-8000 sublimate solution under considerable pressure; the result is that the cartilage may be dislodged by the fluid and carried within reach ; should this fail, the opening in the capsule must be enlarged sufficiently to expose the interior of the joint and the cartilage searched for. In some cases, however, it may be impossible to find it; the search should then be abandoned, and the surgeon should wait until the cartilage has reappeared before operating again. After the wound has healed, passive movement should be begun in order to prevent adhesions about the incision in the capsule.

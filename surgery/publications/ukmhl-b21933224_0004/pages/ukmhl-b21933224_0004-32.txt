THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. s the head of the bone without any extensive division of important structures, a very satisfactory result indeed is likely to be obtained. The third course which remains for adoption when both of the foregoing are impracticable, is excision of one or both of the articular surfaces of the affected joint. It is generally sufficient to excise one articular surface alone in order to reduce the dislocation and to restore movement in the joint; this point will be gone into more fully in connection with dislocation of individual joints.

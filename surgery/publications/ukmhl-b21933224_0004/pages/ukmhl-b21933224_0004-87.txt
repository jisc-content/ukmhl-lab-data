DISLOCATIONS OF THE PATELLA. 63 months after the occurrence of the injury. We have met with two such cases, and have operated in both instances with satisfactory results. The operation was performed through two free vertical incisions, one on either side of the patella, that on the outer side being made to divide the shortened capsule, which by its contraction prevented the patella from coming into position; from the one on the inner side an elliptical portion of the cicatricial tissue which represented the capsule was excised (see Fig. 28, A). As soon as these incisions were made, reduction was quite easy. Fig. 28.â€”Diagrammatic Representation of the Operation for Unreduced Dislocation of the Patella. A. The first stage of the operation. A free vertical incision a is made on the side of the patella towards which it is dislocated, while the cicatricial tissue formed about the rent in the capsule /; on the opposite side is excised. B. The final stage. When the patella is pulled into position, the gap b becomes the sutured incision h', and the incision a the gap a'. The only important points in this operation are to divide the capsule to the outer side sufficiently freely to prevent any hindrance to the patella coming into place, and to excise through the inner incision enough of the capsule and the cicatricial tissue to keep the patella in position, when the margins of the incision are stitched together with fine catgut (see Fig. 28, B). After the skin wound is sutured, the limb is put on a back splint in the semi-flexed position. As soon as the wound has healed, the treatment is practically that for the ordinary outward dislocation of the patella. Passive movement is begun in a fortnight, and massage and passive movement are continued until the knee has regained its full measure of mobility. Spontaneous movement, however, should not be allowed until five weeks after the operation, when the patient may be permitted to commence walking, wearing an elastic bandage.

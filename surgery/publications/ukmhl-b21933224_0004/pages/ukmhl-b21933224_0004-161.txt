TUBERCULOSIS. 137 put in the foreground. In cases of active disease with mal-position in children, the best treatment in most cases is to perform arthrectomy, if the joint be accessible. By so doing, the disease is not only removed and the patient cured, but it is generally found that the limb can be readily restored to its normal position. Should there still be an obstacle to re-position after arthrectomy, it is usually caused by a contracted tendon or band of fascia which can be divided. It is necessary to employ a fresh knife for the tenotomy so as not to infect the tendon sheath. In adults, excision should be employed, and if the deformity be great, the limb may generally be brought into good position by removing an extra amount of bone. When the disease is entirely cured and merely a deformity is left behind, suitable operative measures for the deformity should be employed. These will be excision in adults or arthrectomy or osteotomy in children. The â– choice between these operations, however, depends so much upon the particular deformity present that we cannot discuss them here

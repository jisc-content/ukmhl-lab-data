314 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE. It is about this period of life that curvature is very apt to result from faulty positions. Some attention has been directed to the possibility of producing lateral curvature by faulty positions during sleep. Many children sleep upon the back and this of course is obviously the best position. A large number however lie upon one side, and it has been said that, if the child constantly lies upon one side more than the other, this- is likely to produce curvature of the .spine. This view is probably an exaggerated one, but in all cases it is well, if the child be unable to sleep upon the back, to encourage sleeping upon alternate sides. The child should lie on a firm mattrass and not upon a feather-bed, and the head should not be unduly raised. The positions usually adopted by children at school when sitting at a desk, writing, reading, or drawing, or when playing the piano, are often faulty, and calculated to produce scoliosis. The child is generally either seated upon a form without any back or, if a chair be provided, the back is usually too straight and is not high enough, whilst the seat of the chair is too far from the ground, and there is a want of proportion between the height of the desk and the chair or form upon which he is sitting. The result is that the child soon gets tired, and, in order to support himself, brings the pelvis to the edge of the chair in order to enable the feet to touch the ground, and he is very often obliged to tilt the pelvis in order to bring one foot into contact with the floor. The spine is thus unsupported / Fig. 8i.â€”The Tvpe of Desk and Chair suitable for Children's use. The details are given in the text. If the child be very weakly, or if there be any actual curvature, a head-rest may be fixed to the chair, and the book may be made to approach the vertical more nearly by increasing the slope of the desk.

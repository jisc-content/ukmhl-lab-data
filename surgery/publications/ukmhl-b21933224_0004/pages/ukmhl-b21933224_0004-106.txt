CHAPTER XI. WOUNDS OF JOINTS. It is customary to divide wounds of joints into the penetrating and non- penetrating varieties, but strictly speaking the latter are not really wounds of joints at all; their only importance is that they may be accompanied by sepsis which eventually terminates in suppuration within the joint. In speaking of wounds of joints we shall confine ourselves to those which actually penetrate the articulation—a condition readily recognised in most cases by the escape of synovial fluid or, when the wound is of large size, by actual inspection. VARIETIES.—From the point of view of treatment, wounds of joints may be divided into punctured wounds, which are generally quite small, and large wounds which freely expose the interior. These latter may again be sub-divided according as they are clean-cut or contused; the treatment will differ in each case. In a punctured wound, caused by a sharp instrument penetrating the joint, there is often no introduction of septic material into the joint cavity; whereas in both the other forms septic •contamination of the joint will almost certainly occur. Again, in considering the question of treatment, distinction must be made between wounds that are quite recent and those in which some time (24 hours or longer) has elapsed since their infliction. The great importance of this subdivision lies in the fact that, in the former group of cases, any micro-organisms that may have gained access to the joint will not have had time to multiply and become diffused throughout the joint and the surrounding tissues, whilst in the latter this serious event will have taken place. TREATMENT OF RECENT WOUNDS OF JOINTS. 1. Punctured Wounds.—Here it is generally safe to regard the articular cavity itself as free from infection; punctured wounds are inflicted by a slender pointed instrument, and the probability is that any

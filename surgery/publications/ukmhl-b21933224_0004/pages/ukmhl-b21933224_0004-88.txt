CHAPTER VIII. DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE AND ITS CARTILAGES. DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE. Traumatic dislocation of the knee joint is a very rare occurrence, as may easily be understood from a consideration of the size of the joint and the strength of the ligaments concerned. Very severe violence is required to produce dislocation, and hence these injuries are usually complex ones, being either compound, or complicated with fracture of the bones in the immediate neighbourhood. VARIETIES.—The knee may be dislocated forwards, backwards, or laterally, and the dislocation may be complete or incomplete; usually it is incomplete. Dislocation of the tibia forwards.—This may occur from direct violence, such as a severe blow received upon the front of the lower end of the femur when the limb is in a position of full extension; the lower end of the femur is thus driven directly backwards. Generally, however, the acci- dent occurs from indirect violence, as, for example, when the foot becomes caught in a hole and fixed, whilst the weight of the body carries the upper end of the femur forward, and thrusts the lower end forcibly backwards against the posterior ligament of the knee joint, which gives way. This structure is generally torn completely, whilst the other ligaments of the joint are also ruptured to a greater or less extent, the amount of damage regulating the amount of displacement. The vessels and nerves in the popliteal space generally lie in the inter-condyloid notch of the femur and are more or less severely pressed upon; should the artery be atheromatous it may be com- pletely torn across. This form of dislocation is the most common. Dislocation of the tibia backwards, although extremely common as the result of disease, is comparatively rarely of traumatic origin. Should it occur, it will probably result from violence applied either to the head of the tibia in front or to the lower end of the femur behind, when the knee is in a flexed position.

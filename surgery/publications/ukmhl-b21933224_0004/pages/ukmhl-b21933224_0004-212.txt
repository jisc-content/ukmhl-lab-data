i88 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. tissues in front of it are separated by the finger and a suitable blunt dis- sector, and raised from it until the margin of the acetabulum is reached. The anterior part of the capsule is freed in this manner as far as possible upwards and downwards, when it may be clipped away almost entirely. When the soft parts are fully retracted, this gives a good view of the interior of the joint, and the acetabulum can be dealt with. The remains of the ligamentum teres are cleared out, and if there be any de- struction of the cartilage covering the acetabulum or any tuberculous deposit in the bone, the whole surface of the acetabular cavity should be thoroughly scraped with a Barker's flushing gouge (see Fig. 44). The next, and perhaps the most difficult, part of the operation consists in defining and removing the posterior portion of the capsule. If the patient be standing the operation well and be in good condition, by far the best way of doing Fig. 47.—Excision of the Hip by an Anterioh Incision. The imerval between the Tensor vaginae femoris externally, and the Sartorius internally is opened up and the neck of the femtir directly exposed. The figure shows how the saw is applied to divide the neck of the bone ht situ. B Fig. 48.—Saws for Division of the Femur. A is the form most useful for sub- trochanteric division, while B is more suited for division of the neck of the femur, where tlie width of the bone to be divided is less. Both forms should be blimt-ended, cross-cut, and very stout, so as to ensure rapid cutting and to minimise the chance of breaking the saw in situ. this is to make an incision behind the trochanter extending upwards and backwards from its posterior border in the direction of the fibres, of the gluteus maximus muscle, which, when exposed, are separated by the handle of the knife: the dissection is then carried gradually downwards until the posterior portion of the capsule is reached.

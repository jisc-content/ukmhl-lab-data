SCOLIOSIS. 323 curve which it is desired to unfold. The patient stands with the opposite side of the body flat against the wall and then bends over the sling away from the wall and either attempts to pick up a heavy weight beside the feet or practises various exercises (see Fig. 83). . Thus the convexity of the curve is fixed against the>ling whilst the movements of the patient unbend it at either end. The above is the principle of the method, but its application may of course be varied to suit individual cases; it may be applied, for instance, in the horizontal or even in the sitting position (see Fig. 84). Fig. 84.—"Rachilysis" as ai-flied in the Sitting Position. Very powerful traction can be exerted in this position by firmly fixing the pelvis and then making traction with the padded slings in such directions as may be necessary to unfold the curves. {Percy Le^vis.) Spinal supports.—The value of mechanical supports to the spine— the so-called "Spinal Braces"—in this class of case has been very much debated. Opinion is still divided as to whether or not they should be employed. It may be stated at once that in the early stages no form of brace or support is permissible which keeps or tends to keep the spinal column rigid; such a support is fallacious in the extreme. It undoubtedly supports the spine to some extent, and may therefore make the patient comfortable and relieve him of the heavy, dull aching pain of which he commonly complains. But its action is most mischievous, since it is essential for cure that the muscles primarily at fault shall be encouraged to perform their function of supporting the spine, and the confinement entailed by the u.se of a tight-fitting jacket must not only fail to effect this but must .actually err in the opposite direction by producing actual wasting of the muscles. We are strongly inclined to limit the use of apparatus to cases

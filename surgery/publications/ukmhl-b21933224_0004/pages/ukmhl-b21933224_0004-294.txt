Thence it is at first directed towards the inner side of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb, running parallel in this course to the extensor secundi internodii ; but, on reaching the line of the radial border of the second metacarpal bone, it is carried downwards longitudinally for half its length, the radial artery being thus avoided, as it lies a little further out. These directions will be found to serve, however Fig. 74.â€”Lister's Excision of the Wrist. The arrangetiient of the tendons on the back 0/ the wrist. LL. The radial (dorsal) incision.

The tendon of the extensor carpi radialis longior is next detached with the knife, guided by the thumb nail, and raised, together with that of the extensor brevoir, also cut, while the extensor secundi internodii, with the radial artery, is thrust somewhat outwards. The next step is the separation of the trapezium from the rest of the carpus by cutting forceps applied in a line with the longitudinal part of the incision, great care being taken of the radial

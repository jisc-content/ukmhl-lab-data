THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. 54 bone will probably slip into the acetabulum with a distinct snap. Should no assistant be available to steady the pelvis, this may be done by the surgeon's unbooted foot pressing directly downwards upon the anterior superior iliac spine of the same side. The traction is exerted at right angles to the long axis of the body, because if employed with the limb fully extended it would be absolutely ineffectual, as the Y-ligament then prevents the descent of the head of the bone; it is strong enough to bear without rupture more pressure than the surgeon can bring to bear. On the other hand, when the thigh is flexed to a right angle upon the abdomen, the Y-ligament is relaxed, and the head of the bone is allowed Fig. 23.—Reduction of a Dorsal Dislocation of the Hip by Bigelow's Method. Final Stage. The limb is circumducted outwards and brought down to the middle line parallel with its fellow. to pass back into place through the rent in the capsule. Care must be taken not to employ too much force, as fracture of the neck of the femur has resulted from too violent attempts to reduce dislocations in this way. Pulleys.—When the patient is very muscular, more satisfactory extension can be obtained if it be possible to fix a pulley directly above him. The pulley is attached to a skein of worsted fastened around the lower part of the thigh. Another plan, which is more particularly adapted for use in children, in whom the pelvis is small and difficult to fix, is to turn the patient over upon his face upon a high table, to bring the pelvis to the edge and then, whilst the trunk lies flat upon the table, to make steady traction

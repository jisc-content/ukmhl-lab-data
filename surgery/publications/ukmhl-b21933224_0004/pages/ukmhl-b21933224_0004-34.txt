THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. ro well the arm be fixed immediately after the reduction of the dislocation, there is a constant tendency for it to drop, when the end of the clavicle immediately projects upwards. Perhaps the best plan is, after reducing the dislocation by pushing the shoulder upwards and backwards, to support the arm in a large elbow-sling fixed around the neck, to place a thick pad in the axilla, another over the outer end of the clavicle, and a third over the front of the fore-arm close to the elbow. An ordinary broad leather Fig. I.—Dislocation of the ."Vcuomial End ok the Ci-avicle. A. Shows the first method described in the text. The strap—kept from slipping by the two bands passmg beneath the opposite axilla—is seen pas^ing over the point of the shoulder and around the elbow, where the two turns are ofien fastened together to keep them from slipping. A wnst-sling only is shown in the figure for the sake of clearness; It should be a large elbow-sling, and the arm should be bound to the side. B. The second method described. There is a pad over the acromial end of the clavicle, beneath the shoulder-cap which is firmly buckled to the elbow-sling. Strap is then carried over the pad upon the clavicle, around the elbow and over the pad upon the fore-arm (see Fig. i. A). When this is tightened up, it presses down the outer end of the clavicle, and also pushes the elbow upwards and backwards. The chief trouble with this apparatus is that the strap is constantly sHpping down over the point of the shoulder, and to prevent this it is necessary to fix straps or bandages to it opposite the anterior and posterior folds of the axilla, and to fasten the ends of these together beneath the opposite axilla. The arm is then bound to the side with an ordinary bandage, with the elbow somewhat

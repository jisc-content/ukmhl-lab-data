36 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. position by a posterior moulded splint. Should this treatment not suffice, it may be necessary to cut down upon the process and fasten it in position (see Part III., p. 91). Fig. 13.—Splint for use after Dislocation of Both Bones Backwards Accom- panied BY Fracture of the Coronoid Process. The elbow is flexed to a right angle and the forearm is fully siipinated. A large pad is inserted between the point of the olecranon and the spKnt. 2. Detachment of the internal epi-condyle.—In young subjects the strain upon the internal lateral ligament often tears off the internal • epi- condyle instead of rupturing the ligament. The injury is of slight im- portance, and all that is usually necessary is to employ an external angular splint with the elbow at a right angle, and the fore-arm midway between pronation and supination. Massage and passive movements should be begun during the first week; as a rule the detached process unites to the rest of the bone fairly readily, although union generally takes place by fibrous tissue. 3. Fracture of the articular surface of the humerus.—This may some- times be met with as a complication of dislocation, and will require to be treated upon the lines laid down for that particular form of fracture (see Part III., p. 77) after the dislocation has been reduced. It will generally be advisable to cut down upon the fracture. 4. Injuries to vessels and nerves.—Anything like severe damage to these structures is a very rare complication of dislocations of the elbow. Naturally there is a certain amount of pressure exerted both upon the vessels and nerves by the projecting lower end of the humerus when

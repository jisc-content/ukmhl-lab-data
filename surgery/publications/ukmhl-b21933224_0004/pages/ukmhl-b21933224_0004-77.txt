DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. 53 rotated somewhat inwards and slightly adducted; by doing this the Y-liga- ment is relaxed, and the head of the bone is disentangled. When flexion has been carried to its fullest limit, downward pressure should be made upon the knee, so as to depress the head of the bone, and at the same time the limb should be strongly rotated outwards. Abduction is next carried out to its fullest limit (see Fig. 22), the result being that the head Fig. 22.—Reduction of a Dorsai, 'Dislocation of the Hip by Bigelow's Method. Second Sia^e. The fully flexed limb is now abducted to its utmost limit, and rotated fully outwards. of the bone passes downwards behind the acetabulum, and then forwards to a point opposite the rent in the capsule. The limb is finally rapidly circumducted outwards, and brought down parallel to its fellow (see Fig. 23); the head of the bone is thus made to enter the rent and slip into the acetabulum. The success of these manoeuvres depends upon the integrity of the Y-ligament, which forms a fixed point around which the head of the bone rotates. Reduction by traction.—Should reduction by manipulation fail, either because the opening in the capsule is too small, or because the Y-ligament has been injured, attempts should be made to reduce the dislocation by traction. The patient should be fully anaesthetised and laid upon his back as before, while an assistant firmly fixes the pelvis. The surgeon then flexes the hip joint to a right angle, and at the same time adducts and rotates the thigh inwards so as to disentangle the head of the bone (see Fig. 24). Firm vertical extension is then made upon the thigh, at first quite steadily and later on in a series of jerks, when, after a time, the head of the

DIVISION 11. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE. CHAPTER XXV. INJURIES OF THE SPINE. Injuries of the spine are of common occurrence and vary in gravity according to the severity of the violence producing them. CAUSES.—The most common cause is sudden extreme flexion of the spinal column, the injury being therefore due to indirect violence. The less severe lesions may sometimes result from very powerful muscular action. Common examples of these injuries are seen in hunting or bicycle accidents, in which the patient falls upon the head or upper extremities, and the spine is forcibly doubled up. Damage may also be caused by sudden twisting or over-extension of the spine, as contrasted with over-flexion ; an example of this is a fall across a bar. Direct violence, particularly direct blows upon the back which drive the upper part of the spine forward, while the lower remains stationary, is also an important cause; as an example may be cited the case of a man digging in a pit and struck by a fall of earth or stones upon the upper part of the spine. Other causes of spinal injury are jars and concussions, such as are seen i« railway accidents and falls upon the back, the feet, or the buttocks. RESULTS.—The results of these injuries vary in degree according to their severity, to the position of the patient at the time of the accident and to the strength of the muscles and ligaments concerned. (1) The mildest form of injury is a sprain of the spinal muscles and ligaments, resulting in severe cases in a rupture of muscles and ligaments; these lesions usually follow violent flexion or rotation of the spine. (2) In more severe forms of injury, the ligaments within the spinal canal are torn, and haemorrhage results, the latter sometimes even without rupture

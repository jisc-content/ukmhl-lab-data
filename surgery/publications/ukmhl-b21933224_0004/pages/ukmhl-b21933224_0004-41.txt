DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. 17 edge of the glenoid cavity, and the next step in the manipulation causes it to rotate upon this and not upon its own vertical axis (see Fig. 8, A). The arm is then firmly rotated outwards until outward rotation can be carried no further (see Fig. 4). This brings the head of the bone outwards from the coracoid process to beneath the acromion, and relaxes the outer and posterior portion of the capsule, which has been unduly on the stretch (see Fig. 8, B). The whole arm is now brought forwards and upwards, full outward rotation of the humerus being still maintained, until the limb is Fig. 4.â€”Kocher's Method of Reducing Dislocations of the Shoulder. Second Stage. While the elbow is kept .it a right angle and firmly pressed to the side, the forearm is rotated outwards as far as it will go. almost at a right angle to the body (see Fig. 5). This relaxes the front and upper part of the capsule so that the gap in the capsular ligament is freely open, while at the same time the head of the bone comes down almost to its normal position (see Fig. 8, C). The last step in the manipulations is to rotate the arm inwards, and to carry the elbow somewhat across the front of the chest, making the fingers touch the opposite shoulder (see Fig. 6) which brings the head of the bone back through the rent in the capsule (see Fig 8, D); at this point the head generally slips into PT.

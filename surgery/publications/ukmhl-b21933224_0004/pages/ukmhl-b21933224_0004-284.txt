26o THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. excision. The elbow joint i.s the joint of all others in which operative treatment yields a most satisfactory result, because a successful operation should result in a perfectly movable joint. We therefore strongly recom- mend that this treatment should be adopted before abscesses or sinuses occur, as soon, that is to say, as it is evident that the disease is not coming to a standstill under expectant treatment. (b) Operative.—/// children the operation will be arthrectomy, whilst in adults it will be excision. Arthrectomy in children is an extremely satisfactory operation which generally leaves a certain amount of movement, although the restoration of function is not complete. In adults excision removes the disease thoroughly and at the same time leaves a movable joint, and, if proper care be taken in-^the after-treatment, the resulting joint is practically perfectly useful in something like 70 or 80% of the cases. Arthrectomy of the elbow.—This operation is best performed through two long lateral incisions, one on either side of the joint. On the inner B Fig. 70.—Incisions for Arthrectomy of the Elbow Joint. These are also those recommended for use in excision. A is the incision on the inner, B that on the outer side. side, the incision should reach from just below the point at which the ulnar nerve pierces the internal intermuscular septum downwards to about two or three inches below the level of the joint. On the outer side, the incision may extend slightly higher up the arm, but must not reach as low down

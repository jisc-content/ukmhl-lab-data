DISEASES OF THE SHOULDER JOINT. 251 which is a great disability to the patient. Moreover, unless special care be taken to prevent it, stiffness will occur with the arm in such a position that the limb is rendered very useless; that is to say, it is rotated inwards and firmly applied to the side. If expectant treatment is to be employed, the limb should be abducted to about 45°, and kept midway between extreme inward and outward rotation, that is to say with the fore-arm looking almost directly forward. Abduction can be secured by a large wedge-shaped pad in the axilla with the base downwards (see Fig. 66), whilst the fore-arm should be flexed to a right angle. The elbow may be Fig. 67.—Weight Extension applied for Tobhrculous Shoulder Joint Dis- ease. The extension is made with the arm in the al ducted position. In the figure above, however, the arm is rotated too much inwards. Care should he taken, by using a thick wedge cushion,'with its base beneath the hand, to prop up the fore-arm almost into the vertical position. It then corresponds to the position of the limb seen in the preceding figure. fixed by a plaster of Paris casing or a moulded guttapercha or other splint; if desired, the shoulder itself may be left uncovered so that local applications, such as blisters or the actual cautery, may be made to it. Among the local applications the best is the actual cautery. When there is much deep-seated pain, as is commonly the case in the primary bone deposits, the cautery will ofteo relieve it to a very marked extent. The flat cautery should be used (see Part I, p. 19) over the front and back of the joint. Extension has also been used in cases marked by very severe starting pains at night. If this is to be employed, the patient should be confined to bed, the trunk fixed with sandbags, counter-extension made by

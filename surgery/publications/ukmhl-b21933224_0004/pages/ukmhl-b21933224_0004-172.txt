THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. cannot take place until tendons have been divided ; and although some surgeons consider it dangerous to do this in hysterical cases lest the upper end should be drawn too far away from the lower by the con- tinued muscular contraction, this danger is, as a matter of fact, not a very real one, and we should recommend tenotomy as the proper course to adopt. The joint must then be fixed in proper position until union has occurred, or at any rate for two or three weeks, but in the interval the apparatus should be removed daily for the employment of massage and the other methods referred to above. In cases marked by excessive pain, some surgeons have proposed excision of the joint or amputation of the affected limb, but the results are likely to be disastrous. The pain recurs higher up, either in another joint or in the nerves of the limb ; fresh amputations may be called for, and the condition of the patient is not by any means improved. Active surgical intervention of any_ kind, even as far as the employment of counter-irritation, should on no account be adopted for hysterical joints in adults. It sometimes happens that a joint that has been the seat of a hysterical affection may afterwards become affected with some true organic lesion; in such cases, of course, it becomes necessary to treat the latter, but, while doing so, the fact that the patient is hysterical must always be borne in mind, and must to a certain extent influence the treatment. agguBasaimmiiaaaaaaaaim

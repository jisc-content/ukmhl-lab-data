55 DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. vertically downwards upon the affected limb, which will then hang fiexcd at a right angle over the edge of the table. When there is difficulty in reducing the dislocation in either of these ways, the cause is probably an insufficient opening in the capsule, aaid, to enlarge this, the limb should be circumducted several times as freely as possible, when in all probability renewal of the manipulations will enable the dislocation to be successfully reduced. After-treatment.—This is extremely simple, as the tendency to recurrence of the dislocation is very slight. The patient should be put to bed and the lower extremities may be tied together, whilst evaporating lotions, or an ice bag (see Part I., p. 9) are applied for two or three days to reduce Fig. 24.—Reduction of a Dorsal Dislocation of the Hip by Traction. The pelvis is steadied by an assistant and the surgeon makes traction at right angles to the pelvis by grasping the limb as shown above. any swelling that may result. After three days a certain amount of passive movement may be carried out carefully, and within a week the patient may be allowed to stand and walk. For some weeks, however, he should be warned against too great flexion or abduction of the limb, because these movements might reproduce the dislocation as long as the rent in the capsule remains unhealed. (b) Dislocation into the sciatic notch.—Here reduction is effected in a similar manner, except that as a rule the hip joint requires to be flexed to its extremes! possible degree first of all so as to disengage the head of the bone from beneath the tendon of the obturator internus. DISLOCATIONS FORWARDS.—Reduction of the.se dislocations is effected very similarly except that the movements of manipulation must be more or less the reverse of those already described.

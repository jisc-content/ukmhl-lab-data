THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. 42 after that, the patient may be allowed to discard the splint, moving the arm for himself, but keeping it constantly in a sling for another two weeks, at the end of which time the arm may be left free; the patient should be cautioned not to carry heavy weights or attempt any forcible movements for at least another fortnight. \ Fig. 14.— Ai'i'ARATUs for use after Dislocation of the Head of the Radius Forwards. The posterior rectangular splint and the portion of the forearm are the same as in the preceding figure. The anterior splint is a moulded one, and has a pad between it and the front of the head of the radius. Operative measures.—Unless the surgeon can assure himself that reduction is satisfactory, it will be necessary to expose the articulation and remove the remains of the orbicular ligament from between the bones; otherwise the dislocation will certainly recur and will entail very considerable dis- ability which requires for its cure an operation at a later date and under much less favourable circumstances. When it is impossible to secure satisfactory reduction of the dislocation under an anaesthetic the wisest plan is to cut down upon the head of the radius and replace it in position. This is quite readily done by the angular incision recommended by Kocher for excision of the elbow. The joint is flexed to an angle of 150°, and an incision is commenced one inch above the external condyle and carried down along the external supracondyloid ridge to the head of the radius, and thence to the subcu- taneous border of the ulna three inches below the tip of the olecranon (see Fig. 15). This incision runs between the supinator longus and the triceps above, and between the extensor carpi ulnaris and the anconeus below, and

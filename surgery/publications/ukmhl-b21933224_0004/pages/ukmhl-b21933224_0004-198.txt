THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. 174 has been applied; this is largely due to the weight of the limb, which is gradually producing extension at the hip joint. If the pain be excessive, two or three pads may be placed behind the knee so as to prevent the limb being brought down to the vertical; these are gradually diminished in thickness so as to allow the limb to come down by degrees, which it will then do without pain. The patient should be encouraged to persevere with the splint in spite of the pain, which should cease in a few days when the limb is got into good position. A very serious fault frequently committed by instrument makers is to mould the splint to fit the body of the patient accurately whilst the limb is in the position of deformity. Thus, it is curved forward in the loin to correspond to the amount of lordosis; below this comes the â– concavity for the buttock, and then it is bent forward again to corre- spond to the flexion of the leg. The result is that by no possibility can the flexion be overcome, as the apparatus fixes the limb in the faulty position. If a good result is to be obtained, it is absolutely essential to overcome the flexion, and, when a Thomas's splint alone is employed, this must be applied as he himself recommended; namely, in the form of a straight bar simply curved where it lies over the buttock, the other parts of the apparatus being absolutely vertical.

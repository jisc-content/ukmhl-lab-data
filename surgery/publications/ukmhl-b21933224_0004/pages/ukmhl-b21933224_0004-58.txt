34 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. of the brachialis anticus or to the coronoid process into which it is inserted. Should these structures remain intact, the displacement is comparatively slight, as the coronoid process usually hitches against the lower end of the articular surface of the humerus; whereas if they be torn through, the process passes backwards until it lodges in the olecranon fossa, 'i'he essential factor that determines whether the displacement shall be simply backwards or to one side as well is the direction of the force producing the injury. If the arm be driven inwards or outwards as the ligaments give way, the dislocation will be both backwards and in one or other of these directions. Complications.—Dislocations of the elbow may be complicated either with a fracture of some part of the articular surfaces or with injuries to vessels or nerves in the neighbourhood; the dislocation may also be compound. Treatment.—(a) Of simple dislocation.—This is usually quite easy. An anfesthetic should be administered if possible, and as a rule the bones slip into place after very slight extension as soon as the patient is fully under its influence. Fig. 12.—Methoo of Reducing a Dislocation of Both Hones of the Fore-arm Backwards. The knee fixes the lower end of the humerus. Tr.iction is made with the limb as nearly e.xtended as possible, and then the joint is flexed across the knee.

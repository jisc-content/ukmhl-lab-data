PREFACE. ix addicted, we would desire once more to reiterate the fact that the object we originally set before ourselves was to describe as fully as possible only those methods of treatment which have- proved most efficient in our hands. To this plan we have adhered; and therein also will be found our justifica- tion for the omission of certain newly-introduced methods of treatment which may prove of great value, but which are as yet too recent to enable a definite verdict to be pronounced upon them. To describe all methods of treatment would be to convert a manual into an encyclopsedia. London, October. 1900.

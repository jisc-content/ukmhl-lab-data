THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. 52 TREATMENT OF THE REGULAR FORMS OF DISLOCATION. In all the regular dislocations of the hip, the best method of reduction is by the performance of manipulations designed to cause the head of the femur to pass back into its proper position along the same path that it followed as it escaped from the joint. This is a point of great import- ance, as reduction may thus be effected without the necessity for over- coming the exceedingly powerful muscles which surround the joint. In all cases it is very important that a general anaesthetic should be employed although, undoubtedly, the bone may sometimes be quite readily replaced without one. DISLOCATION BACKWARDS. — (a) Dislocation upon the dorsum ilii.—-Wherever possible the method of reduction by manipulation —called after Bigelow, who introduced it—should be attempted. Fig. 21.—Reduction of a Dorsal Dislocation of the Hip hv Bigelow's Method. First Stage. While the assistant steadies the pelvis, the surgeon flexes the affected limb to its utmost limit, and at the same time slightly .idducts it and rotates it inwards so as to disentangle the head of the bone. Bigelow's method.—The patient is laid flat upon the back upon the floor, or upon a low fiat couch, and the surgeon, standing upon the affected side, raises the thigh, and flexes it fully upon the abdomen, whilst an assistant fixes the pelvis (see Fig. 21). In doing this, the knee should be flexed to a right angle, and is useful in the later stages as a lever for rotating the limb. As the full flexion is carried out, the femur should be

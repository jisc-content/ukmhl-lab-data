RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. and a stable limb is obtained. At the same time it must be admitted that excision of one knee may be followed comparatively rapidly by the appear- ance of the disease in the joint on the other side, and this is probably brought about to some extent by the increased strain thrown upon the movable articulation by the stiff limb. At the same time, the risk of this is not sufficient to warrant our refusing to relieve the patient of his existing trouble by excision. In the elbow, operation gives a very fair result, and in the shoulder, excision, although it seldom gives a perfectly useful joint, often gives marked relief. A point to be remembered with regard to excision in these cases is that the operation need not be the prolonged proceeding that is necessary in tuberculous cases. There is no need to remove all the synovial meijibrane; it suffices to remove sufficient bone, and the operation is therefore usually unaccompanied by any par- ticular shock.

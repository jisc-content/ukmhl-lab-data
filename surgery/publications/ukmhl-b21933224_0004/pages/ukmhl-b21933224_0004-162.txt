CHAPTER XIV. SYPHILITIC AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. During the course of syphilis various joint affections may be met with;, they occur during the secondary or the tertiary stage, and are sometimes met with in hereditary syphihs. JOINT AFFECTIONS DURING THE SECONDARY STAGE. Two forms of joint trouble are met with during the secondary stage. About the period when the earliest secondary symptoms manifest them- selves, it is not uncommon to find the patient complaining of indefinite pain in a joint and a little stiffness, unaccompanied by any marked tender- ness on pressure, but generally associated with pains in the bones and muscles. There may be some effusion into the joint, with a certain amount of fever, and several joints may be affected. It is probable that the affec- tion is simply a congestion of the synovial membrane and the other joint structures very similar to the congestive eruptions on the skin. In the later stages of the secondary period, true synovitis with effusion is sometimes seen. This commences slowly and painlessly, and is accom- panied by slight stiffness followed by swelling due to effusion; this, though usually moderate in amount, may sometimes be considerable. The affection is most frequent in the knee, and is not uncommonly bi-lateral. The effusion consists of a clear serous fluid, and there is no tendency to suppuration, nor are there any signs of acute inflammation. A marked characteristic of this secondary syphilitic synovitis is its intermittent char- acter ; at one time the joint may be markedly distended, whilst a few days later the fluid may have entirely disappeared; then again, for no known reason, the fluid reappears. Treatment.â€”In the joint affections in the early stages of the secondary period, the treatment consists essentially in the administration of mercury (see Part I., p. 232). Later in the secondary stage it is of advantage to combine iodide of potassium with this drug.

THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE. above and that below the ones to be operated upon, in order to gain proper access to the laminae. Reftioval of the lamince.—The spinal canal is now opened by removing the laminae. Here there is a choice between two procedures : in the one the laminae are completely removed; in the other, they are detached, lifted up upon a hinge and subsequently replaced in position. In cases of fracture the laminte must be removed; in other cases the alternative procedure Fig. 77.—Removal of the Lamina in Laminectomy. The spinous processes have been clipped off with the pliers, .Tnd the open- ing into the spinal canal is made by means of the trephine hole seen on the lowermost neural arch. The opening is then easily enlarged, until the entire lamina is removed. Fig. 78.—Method of Retaining the Lamin/e in Laminectomy. The thick black lines show (semi-diagrammalically) the in- cisions necessary to turn up the block of three laminae. The incisions through the bones are made partly with a Hey's saw and partly with a chisel, while the ligamenis are divided with probe-pointed scissors. may be adopted. The great difficulty in either case is the removal of the first lamina because it is essential to avoid injuring the cord in the process ; it may be done in various ways. If the laminae are to be completely removed, it is simplest to apply a small trephine (| inch crown) over the root of the spinous process (see Fig. 77) and remove a circle of bone; then, working laterally with a pair of cutting pliers on each side, the whole lamina can be

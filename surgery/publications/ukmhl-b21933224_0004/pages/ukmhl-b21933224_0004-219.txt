CHAPTER XX. DISEASES OF THE KNEE JOINT. The knee is so commonly affected by one of the various diseases already described that what has been already said as to their treatment will apply to this joint without much modification, and we need here only go into certain special points. ACUTE SYNOVITIS. This is one of the commonest affections of the knee, and generally occurs after sprains • it is sometimes a result of simple exposure. It may also be associated with rheumatism, although the true rheumatic in- flammation of joints affects the fibrous capsule rather than the synovial membrane. SYMPTOMS.—The symptoms vary with the acuteness of the inflam- mation, but they consist essentially of effusion of fluid into the joint, and pain which is increased on flexing or extending the limb. The joint usually assumes the semi-flexed position, the fluid effused is coagulable, the synovial membrane is congested and infiltrated with cells, and, in the more acute cases, its surface may be covered with a layer of fibrin; when this occurs, adhesion between the two opposing surfaces may take place. This adhesion is at first fibrinous, but, if the part be kept at rest, organisation may occur later on and give rise to true fibrous adhesions which may be so extensive as to lead to complete obliteration of that portion of the joint cavity. Adhesions of course only occur after the effusion has become absorbed or has been removed; as long as fluid is present, the synovial cavity is distended and its surfaces are separated. TREATMENT.—This largely depends upon the acuteness of the inflammation and the character of the effusion. When much fibrin is poured out and the inflammation is acute, there is great probability of adhesions forming afterwards, and the treatment must be mainly directed to their prevention. In slighter cases—as after slight sprains—there is

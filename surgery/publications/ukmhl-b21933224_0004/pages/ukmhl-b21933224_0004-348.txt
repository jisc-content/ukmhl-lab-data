324 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE. in which the curvature shows signs of increasing in spite of vigorous treatment in the directions just mentioned, or to those where the pain is very severe and the weakness of the muscles excessive. In these cases the support should only be worn now and then during the day, not all day long, and we would insist that any support should be of the lightest possible variety consistent with efficacy. It should be made of light steel bars taking purchase from a pelvic band and should be furnished with suitably padded springs so directed as to apply pressure at the requisite spots—which are generally the convexity of the curve and over the angles of the ribs where they are rotated backwards. Again, the apparatus should be so fashioned as only to support the spine when it is in a position of rest; that is to say, it should not be sufficiently tight-fitting to keep the spine immovable and Fig. 85.—Si'iNAi. Brace kor Scoliosis. This may be taken as a type ol" apparatus suitable for the affection. It will be seen that the various parts can be adjusted by means of the nuts shown in the figure. (Percy Lewis.) therefore interfere with the proper action of the back muscles. Even then it is well that the jacket should be worn as little as possible and should be only applied at intervals during the day. At night of course no apparatus should be worn, attention being mainly directed to the posture in which the patient sleeps. A spinal brace of this kind is shown in Fig. 85. It requires careful adjustment as the curvature diminishes. (7) Cases in whicli the curvature cannot be diminished by suspension.— Such marked changes may have taken place on the spinal column that the curvature shows little or no improvement on suspension. Here it is practically hopeless to attempt any rectification, and the utmost the surgeon can do is to prevent the affection from increasing and to treat any symptoms, such as pain, that may be complained of.

332- THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE. Series J.—With Dowd's Machine. Note.—In using Dowd's machine, the patient is to commence without any other weight than that of the weight-carrier. Gradually weights are added as the doctor may direct. It may, for various reasons, be found necessary to add more weights to one side than to the other. For instance, in the face-to- machine exercises for a patient with rotation to the right, it would be well to place more weights on the right side than the left. In the back-to-machine exercises greater weight on the left would then tend to untwist. ... I.

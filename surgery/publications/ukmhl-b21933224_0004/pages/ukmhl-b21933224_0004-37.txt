DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. 13 into place by manipulation, it may be necessary to cut down and remove the sternal end. For this purpose a curved incision with its convexity upwards should be made over the inner end of the clavicle, which is exposed when the flap is turned down. The periosteum is then incised parallel with the long axis of the bone, and most carefully stripped off by a rugine. A suitably curved copper spatula is then passed around the bone immediately beneath the periosteum, and the sternal end is nipped off b)- a pair of powerful cutting pliers, after which it is seized Fio. 2.â€”Dislocation of the Sternal End of the Clavicle. The shoulders are first drawn well back by the handkerchiefs braced together, as shown in A. Finally the forearm is fle.xed across the chest and the elbow supported by the oblique band of strapping seen in B. by bone forceps and most carefully removed, any structures retaining it being peeled off by the help of a rugine and a few touches of the point of the knife kept accurately in contact with the bone. At this stage of the operation extreme care is required, because there is always a risk that adhesions may have occurred between the end of the bone and the innominate vein, but the risk of any accident from this is^ comparatively slight if the periosteum be peeled off completely before the] end of the bone is removed. The wound is sewn up without a drainage tube, and the arm is kept in a large elbow-sling until healing is complete, when the sling may be abandoned and the patient allowed to use the limb.

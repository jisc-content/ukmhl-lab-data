176 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. lower extremities are slightly abducted (see Fig. 41). Here also a pelvic band is absolutely essential to prevent the patient moving the pelvis laterally. Another apparatus of very great value in these cases is Phelps's box, which will be more particularly referred to when we deal with the treat- ment of spinal caries. Phelps's box (see Fig. 42) is essentially a large trough diverging into two narrower troughs below for the lower extremities. In this the patient can be kept lying flatter and more comfortably than in the Thomas's splint, whilst adduction is readily prevented and extension Fig. 41.- Mkthoi) of Aimm.ication of the DouBr.E Thomas's Splint for Hii- Disease.

There are na braces as in the single form of splint as of course the patient cannot walk. can be obtained by elastic tubing attached to the foot-pieces of the splint below; the child can thus be carried about and wheeled out without disturbing him, or interfering with the extension (see Fig. 43). Another apparatus which is also useful and is very similar to the Phelps's box is Bonnefs wire splint, which is practically a wire tray made to fit the trunk and limbs, into which the patient is fastened so that he can be readily carried about without disturbing the joint. Operative interference is rarely required in the first s'tage of the disease, but sometimes, when there is clearly a deposit in the neck of the femur, good results may be obtained by cutting down upon and removing it before the joint has become infected. The difficulty here is to make an exact diagnosis. Probably the neck of the bone and the great trochanter will

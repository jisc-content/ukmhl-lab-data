6 GYNAECOLOGY, DIAGNOSIS IN the vaginal examination {q.v. antea); contra- indications are acute inflammation and advanced cancer of uterus. (2) Method and Details : (a) the patient assumes the dorsal posture in an easy attitude (head comfortably supported, thighs flexed on the abdomen and abducted and rotated slightly outwards, and heels resting on the couch or bed); (6) the gynsecologist keeps the fore and middle fingers of the right hand in the vagina (as during the per vaginam) and places them in contact with the vaginal portion of the cervix with the palmar surface turned forwards ; the thumb lies over the left labium majus and the little and ring fingers are folded in the palm of the hand; he then places the tips of the fingers of the left (or " abdominal") hand upon the anterior abdominal wall in the middle line about two inches above the symphysis pubis; the actual palpation can now be begun; (c) with the internal hand the perineum is pressed back- ward and the cervix is pushed upward, so that the fingers touching it lie in the axis of the pelvic brim; the fingers of the external hand then press downwards into the brim, and if the uterus is lying to the front, the fingers in the vagina feel an impact against them from the cervix, and this demonstrates that the uterus is in its usual position and is between the two examining hands ; the learner may now reverse the procedure and press with the internal fingers sharply upwards, when he ought to feel the body of the uterus roll under his external hand placed on the abdomen; when the uterus is displaced backwards or much to the side, the fingers of the examiner's two hands will feel each other through the intermediate tissues; {d) the process above described is now repeated for the other parts and structures, the fingers palpating the sides and the back of the pelvis so as to note the size, consistence, form, and relations of the organs, growths, deposits, etc., lying there; (e) skill in this method of exam- ining is only attained by constant practice, but when gained it is invaluable ; (/) it is necessary for the bladder and rectum to be empty before a satisfactory bimanual examination can be made; and it is well to take in order all the organs and structures in the pelvis and examine each in turn (do not be satisfied with the detection of one lesion, e.g. retroversion of uterus); {g) a typically easy case is one in which the abdominal walls are thin and relaxed, the vagina roomy, the uterus slightly enlarged {e.g. a multiparous woman some days after labour), while a typically difficult one is found when the abdominal walls are thick and rigid, the vagina short and narrow, and the uterus poorly developed {e.g. a nervous nulliparous woman with an infantile uterus); (A) the rationale of the bimanual is found in the dis- placement of the segments of the pelvic floor (the posterior being driven backwards and the anterior upwards) and in the ease with which the uterus can be pressed against the anterior segment by the external hand. (3) Varieties : (a) the form of bimanual above described is the commonest, and may be named abdomino-vaginal; but {b) the recto- abdominal (middle finger of right hand in the rectum, and left hand over abdomen) may be used, especially for the detection of structures lying behind the uterus, or in recto-vaginal septum ; or (c) the recto - vagino - abdominal (middle finger of right hand in rectum, fore- finger in vagina, and left hand over abdomen) may be employed under similar circumstances, and in order to get a very thorough knowledge of the pelvic contents. (4) Aids in performing the Bimanual : {a) the use of an ancBsthetic, (i) the presence of the sound in the uterus, (c) the downward traction of the uterus by a volsella, and {d) the presence of a sound in the bladder will be of service in difficult cases. 6a. Rectal Examination : an occasional pro- cedure in Gynaecology. (1) Indications: {a) when the conditions found by the bimanual examination do not adequately account for patient's symptoms and state ; {b) when there are symptoms pointing directly to anal or rectal disease; (c) when the patient is an unmarried girl or woman, and the vaginal touch is contra-indicated; {d) when a body lying posterior to the uterus has been detected per vaginam but not identified ; and (e) when the vaginal touch is impossible on account of atresia, stenosis, or vaginismus, or from the presence of a tumour. (2) Method : {a) before removing the fingers from the vagina the anterior rectal wall may be exposed by everting it through the anus; this is done by hooking the two " vaginal" fingers backward towards the coccyx and then press- ing them outward towards the anus (Storer's method); in this way the rectal mucosa may be inspected and the use of a rectal speculum rendered unnecessary ; {b) more commonly rectal " touch " is performed ; the patient lies on the side or back ; the gynaecologist washes his hands and draws the tip of his middle or index finger sharply across a cake of soap (in this way the crevice below the nail is filled with soap, which prevents fsecal matter lodging there, while the soap can easily be removed after the examination); the finger is then covered well with vaseline and introduced slowly and with a semi-rotatory movement into the anus, and directed at first forwards and then backwards and upwards; (c) rarely, the patient is put in the genu-pectoral position, and the inspection of the rectum (distended with air) is carried out with the help of a proctoscope, or (rarely) a sigmoidoscope, and an electric light (on the examiner's forehead), as practised by Howard Kelly; {d) the emptying of the rectum by

HIP-JOINT, DISEASES OF 235 The abscesses which form in the thigh usually originate from the cavity of the joint; less frequently they are periarticular; they may present in front of or behind the joint. (1) The anterior- abscess in exceptional cases ascends on the deep surface of the psoas muscle into the iliac fossa; it usually appears in the thigh, and comes to the surface on one or other side of the psoas; the antero - exteriial abscess appears between the psoas and the great trochanter, a little below the anterior superior iliac spine; from the resistance offered by the fascia lata, it may gravitate down the thigh between the sartorius and tensor fasciae femoris before perforating the fascia and erupting through the skin; the antero - internal abscess emerges at the inner border of the psoas, im- mediately above the trochanter minor, and bulges in the adductor region ; it may perfor- ate the pectineus muscle and point below Poupart's ligament to the inner side of the femoral vessels, or it may point anywhere from the perineum to the middle of the thigh. In connection with these anterior abscesses it occasionally happens that when they have opened and become septic the femoral vessels may be eroded, leading to serious and sometimes fatal haemorrhage. (2) The posterior abscess develops in the gluteal region, and may make its way to the surface through the gluteus maximus, more often it points at the lower border of this muscle in the region of the great trochanter, occasion- ally it gravitates down the thigh, or extends upwards towards the posterior iliac spine. Mention must also be made of the extra-articular abscess in the region of the great trochanter, which is often quite independent of the joint, and usually ruptures in the neighbourhood of the trochanter; also of the abscess ivhich originates in the lymphatic glands along the femoral or external iliac artery, which may lead to the formation of tuberculous ulcers and occasionally to erosion of the femoral vessels. The abscesses which form within the pelvis originate either in connection with the aceta- bulum or in relation to the psoas muscle where it passes in front of the joint. Those which are directly connected with disease of the aceta- bulum may remain localised to the lateral wall of the pelvis, or may spread backwards towards the hollow of the sacrum, or open into the bladder or rectum, or ascend into the iliac fossa and point above Poupart's ligament (usually to the outer side of the iliac vessels), or descend towards the ischio-rectal fossa and perineum and point in the vicinity of the anus, or pass through the great sacro-sciatic notch and point in the buttock. The abscess which develops in relation to the psoas muscle may be shaped like an hour-glass, one sac occupying the iliac fossa, the other filling up the adductor region of the thigh, the two sacs communicating with each other through a narrow neck beneath Poupart's ligament. It has been well pointed out by Cheyne that the key to the diagnosis of the point of origin of any pelvic abscess resulting from hip disease, lies mainly in the examination per rectum; if a swelling is felt on the pelvic aspect of the aceta- bulum it is probable that the abscess has started there, and one may be able to recognise fluctua- tion between the iliac swelling and that felt per rectum. If there is no swelling in the region of the acetabulum, the probability is that the abscess has originated in the front of the joint, and has spread upwards into the iliac fossa along the psoas muscle. 77ie fo7'niation of abscess in relation to hi]) disease would be of comparatively little im- portance, were it not that by rupturing on the skin surface it results in the septic complications which are so disastrous, not only by aggravating the ■ tuberciilosis, but also by impairing the general health. The development and progress of abscess, so long as the skin is luibroken, is usually unattended with any fever, or complaint of pain, since unless the patient is carefully examined from time to time the existence of abscess may escape recognition. When the abscess bursts externally septic infection is almost inevitable; this may result in abundant purulent discharge, or where the external opening- is insufficient for drainage, in repeated attacks of inflammation attended with fever, burrowing of the pus, and the formation of fresh sinuses, until the condition of the patient may merge into that of hectic fever or chronic septic poison- ing, in which he loses ground from day to day, becomes the victim of wa::y disease in the viscera, or dies of exhaustion, tuberculous meningitis, or general tuberculosis. We do mean to say that the presence of septic sinuses is incompatible with recovery, but they are a source of danger to which the patient should never be exposed if he comes under treatment with unbroken skin. Dislocation.—True dislocation is a rare com- plication, and should never be allowed to take place in a patient who is under observation. It is more likely to occur during the stage of adduction with inversion. It is often ascribed to slight violence, but it is known to have taken place during sleep from the same spasmodic contractions of muscles that give rise to "start- ings" at night. In the more common dorsal dislocation, adduction and inversion are pro- nounced, the trochanter projects above and behind Nelaton's line, and the head of the bone may be felt on the dorsum ilii. In the upward or supracotyloid dislocation the head lies below the anterior superior iliac spine, flexion is little marked, eversion may replace inversion, the trochanter is farther from the middle line than on the sound side, the adduction is compensated for by tilting of the pelvis, so that there may

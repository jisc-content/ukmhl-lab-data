INSANITY, ETIOLOGY OF 444 suftering fi'oni general paralysis. The essential j nature of his trouble is the cortical disease of his brain. And so it is with the whole group of nervous diseases, we may be struck by the grotesque gestures of chorea, we may be appalled by the convulsions of epilepsy, we may be observant of the attitude of stupor, but we must pass beyond these apparent phenomena to attain a true understanding of the fundamental and real disorder. We must not be over-much occupied by the consideration of the mental symptoms of insanity, we must search for their causes in the ancestors of our patients and in the life-history of the patients themselves. Causes stated.—The Scottish Commissioners in Lunacy have hitherto refrained from report- ing upon the causation of insanity on the ground that the information obtainable is altogether untrustworthy. The English Com- missioners, however, compile tables in regard to causation from information verified by the medical officers of the asylums. These tables show the percentage to the yearly average number of patients in the private and pauper classes admitted. During the five years 1892- 1896 the table stands thus :— Private. Pauper. M. F. M. F. Domestic trouble . 4-5 10-7 4-2 8-8 Adverse circumstances . 8-3 3-9 7-2 4-5 Anxiety and worry . . 14-0 11-0 4-9 5-0 Religious excitement . 1-7 3-1 1-4 1-5 Love affairs . 1-2 3-6 •6 2-0 Fright and shock "7 2-0 •8 1-7 Intemperance in drink . 20-5 8-6 21-7 8-9 Sexual . 2-3 •4 ■9 •6 Venereal disease . 3-9 ■5 Self-abuse . 4-0 •9 1-8 •1 Over-exertion . •6 •6 •3 •2 Sunstroke. . 3-5 •2 1-5 •1 Accident or injury . . 2-9 ■7 4-9 •9 Pregnancy •7 1-2 Puerperal. 6-5 6-4 Lactation . •8 1-6 Uterine and ovarian . 2-4 •8 Puberty .

It will be seen that the mental strain imposed upon the indi- viduals told more heavily upon those of the private class than upon those of the pauper class. The domestic troubles, as might be ex- pected, fall heavily on women, while men are more oppressed by business anxieties and worries. But these single " causes " by no means represent the whole truth. Trouble and worry are in- volved with many other disadvantageous circum- stances, and issue in a deteriorated state of health which leads by easy transition to mental disorder. Turning to the physical causes, the preponderating influence of alcoholic intemper- ance is at once recognised, but one may doubt if the figures represent a close approximation to the truth. A more rigorous investigation materially reduces the percentage, but when the social effects of alcoholism are considered, we may place against that reduction the cases of domestic trouble and adverse circumstances consequent on the abuse of alcohol. On an examination of 48 alcoholic cases out of a total admission number of 520, the proportion was found to be 9-2 per cent at the Perth Royal Asylum, which deals onlj' with private patients. These divided into classes as follows :—A. Alco- holic persons without other ascertained cause. B. Alcoholics who were hereditarily insane. C. Alcoholics with alcoholic heredity. D. Alco- holics consequent on physical stress. E. Alco- holics consequent on mental stress. A 3 "26 per cent. B 3-07 C 2-11 D 0-58 E 0-19 9-21 Or to put a concrete case. A gentleman, whose mother had laboured under recurrent mania all her adult life, informed me that he had for years averted periodical attacks of mental depression by a free use of alcohol. On his admission his symptoms pointed to alcoholic intemperance, but the ordinary motor symptoms soon passed off, leaving him in a state of acute melancholia. Alcohol had at last failed him. His alcoholism was the residt of insanity, and by no means the cause of it. There are other facts, however, which demonstrate the wide- spread influence of alcoholic intemperance in the production of insanity, e.g. the well-known observation of Dr. Yellowlees who showed how good times and high wages filled the Glamorgan County Asylum as a direct consequence of ex- cessive drinking, while the converse also held good. By this table of the Commissioners the effects of bodily diseases, toxic states, crises of life, old age, are also shown approximately. It will be seen that many had previous attacks of insanity in the proportion of 15 or 16 in men to 22 or 23 per cent in women. Lastly, we may remark the percentages stated in regard to heredity, which are assuredly understated owing to the difficulty of obtaining information as to the intimate family history of the cases coming under obser- vation. At any rate, of patients received into the Perth Royal Asylum during the past eight years, the average proportion of those who had

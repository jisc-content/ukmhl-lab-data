HYDATID DISEASE punctured. In the latter case the presence of albumin is possibly due to functional changes induced in the hydatid by the puncture. Changes liable to occur- in the Hydatid Cyst. —The echinococcus often dies spontaneously. Degenerate changes commence just outside the ectocyst; the fluid becomes opaque, coloured, albuminous, and reduced in amount; the scolices fall off, and the hyatid is represented by a pulpy debris which still contains the hooks and possibly fragments of ectocyst, and which, together with the capsule, may undergo calcareous infiltration. Partial ossification has been observed in rare cases. Death of the larva may also be caused by evacuation of the fluid it contains, or by suppuration commencing round the cyst and spreading to its interior. Rupture of the cyst is another possible occur- rence, either as a result of trauma or of atrophy of surrounding structures from pressure. Geographical Distribution. — Statistics from Iceland represent 1-2-3 per cent of the popula- tion as affected with hydatids. Hydatids do not occur in the Faroe Islands (Davidson). In German-speaking countries patients with this disease formed 0-03 per cent of a total 500,000 cases treated in hospital (Neisser), but the dis- ease is comparatively rare in Southern and Central Germany, while more common in the north, especially in Mecklenburg and Pomer- ania. For example, in Rostock there is one case of hydatid disease for every 1056 inhabi- tants. The following figures illustrate the frequency of the disease in different parts of Germany (Peiper):— Hydatids in total Autopsies. Kiel (1872-1887) 0-19 per cent. Munich (1854-1887) 0-25 Jena (1866-1887) 0-84 Greifswald (1862-1894) 1-50 Rostock (1861-1883) 243 In Switzerland ordinary hydatids are rare, occurring in 0'13 per cent of all autopsies. In Vienna (1892-1897) hydatids occurred in 0-02 per cent of hospital patients. In Dalmatia, however, the disease apjaears to be more common than in any other part of Europe. In Servia 0"02 per cent of hospital patients are affected, [n Belgium and Denmark the disease is rare, only four cases are reported from Norway, in [taly and France hydatids are more often seen. In Great Britain hydatid disease is uncommon, but it is more frequent in England than in Scotland (Murchison). In St. Thomas's Hospital Reports 1894-1898 there are 19 cases; in Middlesex Hospital Reports 1893-1897 there are 15 cases; in Westminster Hospital Reports 1889- 1898 only 10 cases; and in Edinburgh Hospital Reports 1891-1897, 11 cases are recorded. In South Africa, Egypt, China, and India, hydatid disease is rare. Osier could find records of only eighty-five cases in the United States and Canada up to July 1891. In the Argentine Republic the disease is common, but very rare in other parts of South America. The disease is common in some parts of Australia, especially in Victoria and South Australia. The average death-rate per 100,000 from this cause during the period 1882-1886 was as follows :—Victoria, 5-79 ; South Australia, 3-54 ; New South Wales, 2-05 ; Queensland, 1*29. In Tasmania hydatids are rather common, giving a death-rate of 2'83 per 100,000, but in New Zealand the corre- sponding mortality is only 0'66 per 100,000 (1882-88, Davidson). Thus the disease is most frequent in Iceland, Australia, Dalmatia, and parts of Northern Germany. Posselt has recently collected records of 215 cases of multilocular echinococcus. Their geo- graphical distribution, which is very remark- able, is as follows:—1. Bavaria 56, Austria (the majority in the Tyrol) 30, Switzerland 27, Wiirtemberg 25, Baden 3, etc., in short 147 cases within a circumscribed area; 8 cases in districts adjacent to this area; 40 cases in the two Russian territories of Kasan and Moscow. 2. 20 cases which occurred irregularly in various countries. No case has occurred in Great Britain. There is as yet no definite proof that multilocular echinococcvis is derived from a special variety of T. echinococcus. The following factors favour the occurrence of hydatid disease :— I. A high percentage of dogs infected with I', echinococcus. 28 per cent of dogs were said to be affected in Iceland, and 6 per cent in Copenhagen (Krabbe). The taenia is a common parasite in Mecklenburg (Madelung), and was found in 40 per cent of unregistered dogs in Australia (Thomas). In England " probably at least 1 per cent of our dogs harbour the mature tape-worm " (Cobbold), whilst in North America it is a rare parasite (Osier). The actual frequency of the dog is of less importance. For example, the ratio of dogs to individuals is 1 :11 in Iceland, 1 :18 in Meck- lenburg (Madelung), and the ratio of registered dogs to persons in Australia is 1 : 23, whilst the registered dogs constitute only a fractional por- tion of the total (Graham), yet the ratio is 1 : 27'8 in Pomerania, 1 : 22 in France, and 1:15 in Belgium. II. Circumstances facilitating the ti'ansmis- sion of the ova to the human subject:— The disease occurs most frequently in those who are brought much in contact with dogs, e.g. Australian shepherds, and is more common in country parts than in towns. The disease is common too in Iceland, where during the long winters the dogs live in the same room with the people, many of whom are so careless that in- stead of washing their dishes they permit them to be licked clean by the dogs (Leuckart).

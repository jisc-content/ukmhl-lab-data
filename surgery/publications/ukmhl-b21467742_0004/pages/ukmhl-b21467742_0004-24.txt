GYNECOLOGY, DIAGNOSIS IN 8 into the vaginal orifice, keeping it well back (sensitive parts are in front), and push it on- wards and upwards, keeping the short side to the front (guided by maker's name) until it meet with resistance; then look through it, and may find cervix is engaged in the end of it, but if not, withdraw it slightly and reintroduce till get view of cervix ; with cotton wool on a sound remove mucus from cervix, so as to see it better. (c) Advantages and Disadvantages: its ad- vantages are that it can be easily introduced, involves slight exposure, is self-retaining, and does not necessitate the assumption of the Sims' position ; but its disadvantages are that it gives no view of the vaginal walls, that it brings to- gether (in a deceptive way) the lips of a torn cervix, that it makes it very difficult to use any other means of diagnosis in association with it {e.g. curved sound or volsella), and that it is useless for the performance of any of the minor operations of gyntecology (save that of applying caustic to the cervix). (3) Valvular Variety of Vaginal Specu- lum : this variety, of which there are many types (Cusco's, Reid's, Barnes' Neugebauer's, and Gau's, which are bivalve, and Nott's, which is a trivalve), has much the same sphere of use- fulness as the tubular. (a) Description: Cusco's instrument consists of two metal blades, jointed to each other at their bases, and having a thumbpiece by which they can be separated, and an apparatus (travel- ling nut on a screw) by which the degree of separation can be regulated and fixed ; in Reid's speculum the blades are separable and move on parallel bars; Neugebauer's speculum really consists of the blades of a Sims' speculum sepa- rated and acting as two. (6) Mode of Use : (1) patient in same position as for the tubular variety; (2) speculum is warmed and has vaseline applied on the outer aspect; it is introdiiced closed, with its blades right and left (to suit the vaginal orifice and labia) : it is held in the right hand, the fingers of the left separating the labia; when passed within the orifice, it is turned round, so that the blades are anterior and posterior (to suit vaginal walls), that with the screw being posterior; the blades are then opened and fixed by the screw; in removing it the blades must first be closed ; both in introducing and in withdrawing it care must be taken not to catch vulvar hairs in it or pinch up the vaginal walls with the blades. {Note.—-The above description applies specially to Cusco's instrument; if Neugebauer's be used, the larger blade is introduced like a Sims', the smaller is passed into the vagina along the anterior wall, and fits into the larger blade.) (c) Advantages and Disadvantages: its ad- vantages are those of the tubular type; so are its disadvantages; but it also causes great separation of the lips of a torn cervix, and may thus mask the lesion, and the vaginal walls may prolapse between the blades and obscure the view. {Note.—The speculum, as a means of diagnosis, is more use|ful to the beginner than to the practised gynaecologist, who has developed his skill in the use of the vaginal and bimanual methods; educated touch will give nearly all the information obtainable by sight.) (II.) Volsella. (a) Description : is a pair of metal toothed forceps; the blades are separable and are secured by a pin, the handles are provided with a simple fixing apparatus {e.g. a metal clasp), the whole instrument has a slight pelvic curve, and each blade has one, two, or (best) three teeth; it should be from eight to nine inches in length. (6) Mode of Use : (1) if it be intended to introduce the volsella by touch alone, then the patient lies on the left side, or semi-prone ; the examiner passes two fingers (index and middle) of the right hand into the vagina and touches the cervix (anterior lip) with them; then, hold- ing the volsella in his left hand, he passes it in, guiding it along the fingers of his right hand, and seizes the cervical lip with it; traction is now made (force of from three to seven pounds may be safely used), and the cervix drawn down to the vulva; (2) if it be the gyntecologist's purpose to introduce the volsella through a speciilum, then the patient lies in the semi- prone or (especially for operative purposes) in the lithotomy position; the cervix is exposed and grasped by the volsella, the examiner guiding the instrument by sight. If the gynaecologist be single-handed, he may fix the volsella by a tape to the patient's dress, or to the bedclothes; with the help of the volsella, and with the patient in the semi-prone position, as good a view (or better) may be obtained of the vagina and cervix as with any speculum. For operative purposes two volsellne may be used, one for each lip. (c) Rationale of Use : the mobility of the uterus and of the anterior segment of the pelvic floor permits the downward displacement of the organ, and the small degree of sensitiveness of the cervical tissues lessens the discomfort to the patient arising from the bite of the instrument. {d) Diagnostic Uses : the volsella serves—• (1) for bringing parts within the range of vision, thus the cervix, vaginal roof, and vaginal walls can be directly inspected for lacerations, polypi, fistulte, erosions, ulcerations, and the like; (2) for bringing these parts within the range of touch, aided hj vision ; (3) for deter- mining the relation of abdominal tumoiu-s to the uterus, downward descent of that organ being accompanied by descent of the tumour if it be uterine, and by no change in its position

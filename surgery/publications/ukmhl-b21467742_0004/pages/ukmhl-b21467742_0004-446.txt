INFLUENZA 428 from a clinical aspect arise from the peculiar aptitude its poison has for fastemng on the points of least resistance in the constitution. Of the many types described, perhaps the four following- stand out most prominently :— 1. The neurotic, neuralgic, or rheumatic type. 2. The cardio-pulmonary type. 3. The gastric or gastro-intestinal type. 4. The febrile type. It is proposed to give a brief clinical sketch of four cases, each illustrating a type observed in the epidemic of 1889-90 in Dublin. I. The Neurotic Type.—One of the earliest cases which the writer saw in the epidemic of 1889-90 was that of a lady, who was seized on the evening of Friday, December 20th, 1889, and who was visited next morning by Dr. James Craig, one of the physicians to the Meath Hospital, Dublin. The following is this lady's own account of her attack: — "Friday, 20th December 1889, I went to the oratorio at St. Patrick's Cathedral apparently in my usual health. Shortly after entering the Cathedral I felt chilled, as if cold water was being poured down my back and legs. When I returned home I warmed myself at a good fire, was given some hot wine and water, and went to bed ; then my face and head got very hot and uncomfortable, and pains began in my arms, shoulders, and legs. All night the pains were very bad, sometimes so sharp across the back of my chest that I could have cried out; and, although I felt burning to the touch, the cold- water sensation continued. I got no sleep that night. Next day, about twelve o'clock (mid- day), I was given a powder (salicylate of sodium), and in two hours afterwards another, which put me into a perspiration. The pains in my limbs got better, but my head began to ache badly, and all day I felt very ill. I suffered from great thirst. Saturday night slept better. Sunday morning about 5 a.m. I wished for a cup of tea, but could not taste it. I might have been drinking hot water. Sunday evening pains had quite gone. I had no headache. I got up for a while, but felt very weak. For several days I had no energy for anything, the least exertion tired me. My sense of taste did not return for four or five days. I also got a cough which was very troublesome. Tempera- ture—Friday night 101° ; Saturday morning 100°, evening 98-8°." II. The Cardio-pulmonary Type.—On Mon- day, December 30th, 1889, Mrs. W., a lady, aged fifty-four years, somewhat frail and delicate, while out walking was seized with shivering and violent headache, and intense pain in the back and "bones." On reaching home she at once went to bed, feeling very ill and prostrate. Next day the tongue was thickly furred and dry. Her pulse was 132 ; respirations, 28; temperature, 103-3°. Having regard to the sudden onset of the illness and the symptoms, the attack was declared to be one of influenza. On New Year's Day (third day) the pulse was 110; respirations, 28; temperature, 102-0°.

January 2, 1890 (fourth day).—The report was that she had a better night. Herpes was showing round the nostrils. Pulse, 96-100; respirations, 28; temperature, 102-4°. Severe stabbing or catching pain was complained of at the lower part of the left side of the chest. No physical signs could be detected, and a hot poultice relieved the pain. January 3 (fifth day).—Pulse, 110; respira- tions, 32; temperature, 102-7°. A lyuaphy crepitation was now audible over the upper part of the left side of the chest, and on deep inspira- tion a fine pneumonic crepitation could be heard. January 4 (sixth day).—-Pulse, 110; respira- tions, 40; temperature, 103-2°. Dulness now- existed, which was rapidly extending all over the left apex, where also a marked frottement could easily be recognised. At 6 p.m. Dr. Watson Pike, K.A.M.C., saw the patient in consultation and agreed in the diagnosis of influenza complicated with a left pleuro- pneumonia. Pulse, 112; respirations, 42 ; temperature, 102-7°. There was not a trace of expectoration, and scarcely any cough occurred. We considered the patient to be in danger, and continued the treatment, which consisted in free stimulation, frequent feeding, and quinine. At 1.30 A.M. of Sundaj', January 5th, the patient was sinking fast. Her pulse was failing, and the temperature was 103-3°. She rallied for a time, but at 6 a.ji. another attack of cardiac failure came on. From this also she rallied, but at 10 a.m. she suddenly died.

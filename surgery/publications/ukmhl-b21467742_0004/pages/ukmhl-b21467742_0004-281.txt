HYDATID DISEASE 263 more important, the frequent occurrence of E. veterinorum in them.—For every hundred persons in Austraha there were in 1892, 300 cattle, 3000 sheep (Verco and Stirling), in Iceland there were in 1883, 46 cattle, 488 sheep (Krabbe), in Mecklenburg-Schwerin there were in 1884, 47-3 cattle, 164-4 sheep, 39-5 swine (Madelung), and in Pomerania there were 168'4 sheep to every 100 persons; where- as for every 100 persons in Italy there were 16"8 cattle, 30'2 sheep, 4-1 swine, in France there were 30'4 cattle, 59'8 sheep, 14*8 swine, in United Kingdom there were 28'2 cattle, 86'4 sheep, 8"2 swine (Madelung), and in these countries E. hominis is comparatively rare. Again, the prevalence of hydatid disease in man is proportionate to the frequency of the disease in the domestic animals. Peiper has shown this to be the case in the various dis- tricts of Mecklenburg, e.g. in Greifswald, where hydatids are common in man, 64'58 per cent of cattle, 51'02 per cent of sheep, and 4'93 per cent of swine are affected. In other parts of Germany not only man but the domestic animals too are comparatively rarely affected, e.g. in Karlsruhe 2-90 per cent of cattle, 2-24 per cent of sheep, and 0'66 per cent of swine have hydatids. In Australia about 44 per cent, and in the Argentine Eepublic, 30 per cent of sheep are affected, and in Iceland the disease is common both in sheep and cattle. The occurrence of E. veterinoruvi is favoured by a mild damp climate, in consequence of which the ovo of T. echinococcus may lie for months on the pastures and still be capable of development. It is the animals kept at pasture during the summer which are most frequently infected. IV. Circumstances facilitating the metamor- phosis of the larval scolices into adult tsenite.— The more frequent the occurrence of E. veter- inorum in the animals slaughtered the greater are the risks of dogs becoming infected. For the diseased viscera are often carelessly disposed of, or even employed to feed the dogs. In the absence of proper slaughter-houses, as in some parts of Mecklenburg imtil comparatively re- cently, dogs are likely to acquire infection. Hydatid disease in relation to the occupation of the individiial.—It is most common in those who are much in contact with dogs, e.g. shep- herds. The possible modes of infection are, however, very numerous, and the disease has been observed in joiners, tailors, and others, though very rarely in seafaring individuals. Sex.—The relative freq\iency in the two sexes depends largely on their occupations and pur- suits. In Iceland the disease is more common in women, as Finsen in 25-5 cases found 181 in the female sex. Neisser found 436 cases in females out of a total of 669; Davaine and Peiper hold that the sexes are equally affected ; but in Australia hydatids are more common in men, the ratio being 100:77 (Verco and Stirling). Age.—Hydatids occur at almost any age, but are rare in children. Neisser gives the follow- ing figures :—0 to 10th year, 4'8 per cent; 11th to 20th year, 13-2 per cent; 21st to 30th year, 30'8 per cent; 31st to 40th year, 24'6 per cent; 41st to 50th year, 15-2 per cent; 51st to 60th year, 6-2 per cent. Hence the disease is most commonly seen between the ages of twentj^-one and forty, and is rare after sixty. Anato7nical Distribution.—In swine the liver is more often affected than the lungs (18 : 2'3), in sheep the liver is less often affected than the lungs (14 : 21), whilst in cattle these organs are about equally affected (7-5 : 8'2) (Peiper). According to Neisser's statistics of 900 cases, the distribution in the human subject was as follows :—Liver 451, lung 67, spleen 28, pleura 17, heart or vessels 29, cranial cavity 68, spinal canal 13, kidney 80, pelvis 36, female genitals or mamma 44, bones 28, face orbit or mouth 21, other parts 18. As a rule only one organ is affected, and in fifty per cent of cases it is the liver. In some cases, however, there are multiple echinococci. In animals these are of common occurrence, and of comparatively small size. In man the liver usually contains one echinococcus, whilst there are echinococci in other situations too. The peritoneum is one of the sites speci- ally affected, for here a solitary echinococcus is rare, but several hundreds are not uncommon. The cause of multiple echinococci is variable. They are, however, usually referred to infection by numerous embryos at one time, to repeated infection, or lastly, and especially in the case of the peritoneum, to development from daughter- bladders, brood-capsules, or scolices which have escaped from the parent-cyst in consequence of tapping or rupture. An illustrative case has been recently recorded by Subbotic. At the post-mortem on this patient, a woman aged 65, there were in the right lung five echinococci each the size of a pea; the liver was enlarged to four or five times its normal size. It contained an echinococcus as large as a child's head, with daughter-bladders the size of apples, two echinococci each as large as a fist, and one other the size of an apple. The omen- tum was adherent to the liver, and contained numerous echinococci varying in size from a hazel-nut to a walnut, and of these the smaller ones were degenerated. There were also echino- cocci in the appendices epiploica) of the de- scending colon, in the pouch of Douglas, in the fundus of the uterus, and in the appendix vermiformis. General Symptomatology.—The symptoms of echinococci are dependent on their site and size, and on the inflammatory and pressin-e effects on neighbouring viscera. In many situations, e.g. the liver, if the cyst does not interfere with any

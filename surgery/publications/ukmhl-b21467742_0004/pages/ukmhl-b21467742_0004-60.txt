Hemorrhage is always present when a blood- vessel is wounded, and the loss of blood may bo so trivial as to give rise to no definite constitu- tional effect, or so severe in case of wound of one of the largest arteries as to prove rapidly fatal. The blood may escape externally through an open wound, or may become extravasated subcutaneously, or into one of the great cavities of the body. A patient may die from haemor- rhage without one drop of blood being shed external to the body, e.g. intraperitoneal haemorrhage. The main considerations in esti- mating the danger of a severe haemorrhage are the quantity of blood lost by the individual and the rapidity with which the hijemorrhage occurs. Of all surgical emergencies there is none more urgent, and none which makes greater demand upon the judgment and presence of mind of the surgeon than a rapid and severe haemorrhage, and upon its proper treatment the life of the patient entirely depends. It is customary to describe four varieties of haemorrhage, classified according to the source of the htemorrhage, viz. arterial, venous, capil- lary, and parenchymatous. In addition to the above we distinguish, according to the time of the occurrence of the bleeding, (a) primary ; (6) reactionary, intermediary or consecutive; and (c) secondary haemorrhage. 1. Arterial H;cniorrhage.—In this variety the blood is bright red (oxygenated), and escapes in jets from the wounded artery synchronously with the beats of the heart. It is to be borne

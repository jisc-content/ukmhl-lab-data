HIESUTIES 246 Various names have been given to general congenital hypertrichosis, among which are polytrichia, trichauxis, hirsuties adnata, dasytes, pilosism, and hyjjertrichiasis. Individuals affected with the anomaly in its most marked form have been called "hairy men," "homines pilosi," " human jmonkeys," " missing links," and " Esaus." German equivalents are " Haarmen- schen," " Waldnienschen," and " Hundemen- schen"; and in French the expressions " les Figs. 1-4. hommes velus," "les hommes des bois," and " les hommes-chiens " are met with. Cases of general hypertrichosis congenita are rare. The first recorded case seems to have been that of Esau, who " came out red all over like a hairy garment " (Genesis xxv. 25), or more literally "all of him as a cloak of hair." The meaning of this hairy birth has greatly puzzled the commentators, and Kalisch pointed to it as " a foreboding of the animal violence of Esau's character." In the Middle Ages there was a difference of opinion also as to whether or not Esau's state constituted a monstrosity, and Pohlius, in 1669, wrote a work with the inter- rogative title, "De Questione an Esau fuerit Monstrum." Among other historical examples was the girl born near Pisa, hairy all over ("totam hirsutam"), whose mother had been gazing at a picture of John the Baptist during her pregnancy (vide T. Fienus, De virilms im- atjinationiit, p. 224, 1635) ; and there was the hairy child Ijelonging to the Ursini family, who had bear's claws as well as the hirsute cover- ing. There was the remarkable hairy family ("homines sylvestres,") from the Canary Islands described by U. Aldrovandus (Monstroriim His- toria, p. 16, 1642); and there was also "Die haarige Familie von Ambras," consisting of a hairy man, his wife normal in the matter of hair, and his hairy son and daughter (Figs. 1- 4), described fully by C. T. von Siebold {Arch, f. Anthrop., ix. 253, 1877-8). Another well- known example of hypertrichosis was " Barbara Ursler," who was publicly exhibited in London in 1655, and who is described in Caulfield's Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters (vol. ii. p. 168, London, 1794-5), and has been recently considered by Strieker (Arch, f. path. Anat., Ixxi. p. 111^ 1877). John Crawford, who studied medicine in the University of Edinburgh in the earlj' years of the past century, and who was afterwards envoy to the Court of Ava, brought before the notice of European authors the famous hairy family of Burma {Journal of Embassy to the Court of Ava, London, 1834); and many others have since contributed details regarding this family. It con- sisted of a hairy man married to a normal woman, of his hairy daughter, and of two hairy grandsons, the children of the daughter by a normal man ; the dentition of these individuals seems to have been defective \{vide J. J. Weir, Nature, xxxiv. 223, 1886). Reference must also be made to the hairy Mexican woman, Julia Pastrana, de- scribed by J. Z. Lawrence {Lancet, ii. for 1857, p. 48), H. Beigel {Arch. f. path. Anat., xliv. 418, 1868), F. L. Neugebauer {Kilka sloiv o mezkiem owlosieniu u Kobiet, 1897), and by J. Ranke (Verhandl. d. Miinchen. anthrop. Gesellsch., 1-4, 1888); she seems to have had hypertrophy of the maxilla (E. Magitot, Gaz. med. de Paris, 4 s. ii. 609, 1873). In Chowne's case {Lancet, i. for 1852, pp. 421, 514; ii. for 1852, p. 51) the hairiness was widespread although hardly inii- versal; the patient, a woman, had a hairless brother and one hairy sister (Wilson, L^ectures on Dermatology, p. 102, 1878). The girl Teresa Gambardella, described by C. Lombroso {Uuomo bianco e Vuomo di colore, p. 155, 1871), re- sembled Chowne's patient to a certain degree. Then there were the famous Russian " hairy men " or the " Kostroma people " described and discussed by many authorities (E. R. Perrin, Bull. Soc. d'anthrop. de Paris, 2 s. viii. 741, 1873; C. Royer, Ibid., p. 718; C. S. Tomes, Brit. Med. ,Tourn., i. for 1874, p. 413; R. Vir- chow, Berl. klin. Wchnschr., x. 337, 1873; G. T. Jackson, Med. Record, New York, xxvii. 568, 1885; and A.

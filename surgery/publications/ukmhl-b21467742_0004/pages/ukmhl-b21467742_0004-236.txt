Injuries to the hip are numerous and may be serious, for even when they are caused by only slight violence the effects upon the patient are often far-reaching and may be of grave import. Bruised Hip.—Contusions of the hip, as a result of falls or blows, are usually of importance only in children and in old people. In children because they may form the starting-point of tuVierculosis or other infective disease of the joint : in old people because a contusion of the hip often resembles in its symptoms, though never in its signs, a fracture of the neck of the femur. But a fall or repeated blows upon the great trochanter may lead at any age to enlarge- ment of the bursa beneath the insertion of the gluteus maximus, or to a remarkable form of chronic osteoporosis known incorrectly as " inter- stitial absorption of the neck of the femur." Symptoms.—In its simpler forms the sym- ptoms of a contusion of the hip differ but little from those of a bruise elsewhere. There is tenderness over the part struck, followed in a few hours by swelling and stiffness, which slowly disappear, whilst the skin passes through a succession of colours due to the oxidation changes produced by the tissues on the hemo- globin of the cxtravasated blood. In old people the shock of the injury is sometimes sufficient to paralyse the limb for a time. The thigh lies motionless on its outer side and slightly ab- ducted, whilst the upper part of the thigh is swollen and tender. It is by no means easy to ascertain in these cases whether the patient is suffering from a bruise or from an intracapsular fracture of the femur. In a bruise the thigh

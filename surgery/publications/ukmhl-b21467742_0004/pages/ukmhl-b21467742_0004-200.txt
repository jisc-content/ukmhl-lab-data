182 HEREDITY what is inherited is a blastogenic variation which expresses itself in an altered mode of eliminating nitrogenous waste,—a constitutional vice which becomes more apparent through excess of food and alcohol. That diseased states of the nervous system run in families is undeniable, but in many cases they change in particular expression from generation to generation. This points to the position which many hold, which is well argued for by Rohde (1895), that what is really inherited is a germinal variation, which may express itself in general neurasthenia, easy exhaustibility, etc., or under sufficient provoca- tion in some form of acute neurosis. There is no clear case of a normal subject becoming an acute maniac through external shock and trans- mitting his disease; and Rohde's conclusion, after a careful survey, is that all transmissible nervous diseases have a germinal origin. As Ciouston has said : " A neurotic heredity is seen to resolve itself into general morbid tendencies rather than direct proclivities to special diseases." What we have said does not imply that per- sistent nerve-fatigue and neurasthenia in parents may not favour the outcrop of neurosis in the offspring, for the abnormal nervous condition may through nutritive disturbances affect the germ-plasm (as even Weismann admits), and the foetus may be readily affected disadvan- tageously through the mother. (cl) The same, or a closely similar diseased state, may arise in different ways, and the heritability will differ with the mode of origin. If the diseased state is inborn in the strict sense, if it be the result of a blastogenic or germinal variation, the probability of trans- mission is great. But if it has been induced M adventitiously by external influences the proba- bility is slight. The distinction is a real one, but it is not always readilj^ drawn in actual practice. Thus the difficulty of distinguishing congenital deafness from that which is adventi- tious—the result, for instance, of various in- fectious diseases—may, perhaps, explain why in E. A. Fay's statistics (3078 marriages, 6782 children), the percentage of deaf children in families where both parents were deaf was 8-458; where one parent only was deaf the percentage was larger, namely, 9'856. Where hoih parents were believed to be congenitally deaf the percentage of deaf children was 25*931; where one parent was deaf congenitally and the other adventitiously, it was 6"538 ; where both parents were adventitiously deaf, it was only 2"326. Where one parent is congenitally deaf and the other hearing, 11*932 per cent of the children were deaf; where one parent was adventitiously deaf and the other hearing, the percentage was 2-244. In short, it is not evident that adventitioiis deafness is inherited. Fay's statistics show that deafness among the rela- tives of the parents increases very largely the likelihood of there being deaf children; and they also seem to show that consanguineous marriages greatly increase the probability of the inheritance of deafness, or of the tendency to it. (e) In many cases there is abinidant evidence of the transmission of a specific disease, but this seems always to be what the biologist would call a disease of germinal or blastogenic origin. Thus we may cite a case of hsemorrhagic tendency given hy Klebs (qiioted by Turner, 1889), where the dark letters stand for affected subjects (all males); it illustrates first a diffu- sion and then a waning of the disease.

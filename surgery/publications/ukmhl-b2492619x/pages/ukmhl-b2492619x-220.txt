Ulcers. 210 a probe paffed forward In the natural direc- tion, and with moderate force, recourfe is to be had to drill cautioufly an artificial open- ing through the os unguis, by a trocar, or any other fharp-pointed inftrument. When the inftrument has penetrated a fufficient depth (which is eafily known, by the want of refiftance), and the blood is difcharged by the nofe, a proper attention to the direction of the inftrument, in making the perfora- tion, is always neceffary. It is to be made in an oblique dire&ion, downwards from the inferior part of the fac. As foon as the perforator is removed, a filver tube is to be introduced into the opening, where it is allowed to remain, until the edges of the wound become callous. As foon as "this is effefted, the tube is withdrawn, and the external wound heals readily.

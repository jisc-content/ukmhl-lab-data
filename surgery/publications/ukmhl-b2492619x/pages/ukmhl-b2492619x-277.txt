The trepan ought to be frequently removed, to examine what depth it has penetrated. Every time it is removed, it is to be rubbed with a fmall brufh, made for the purpofe. As boon as the burgeon has come to the diploe, he is to fecure any hemorrhagy of conbequence, that may occur (O. 238.). When the bone is nearly divided through, if one portion of the bone is completely divided, and the reft ftill uncut, the prefbure of the inftrument is to be entirely applied to the undivided portions. As boon as the bone is found loobe, it is to be removed by a fmall forceps, made for that purpofe. The depreffed por- tion of the bone is now to be raifed, by an inftrument termed a levater, introduced at the opening made by the trepan, below the depreffed portions of the bones. If, after applying a conbiderable degree of force, the bone cannot ftill be raifed, and if it feems to be wedged in by borne other procefs ot bone, the trepan is to be applied again at that

OSSIS \ 14 6 Tumours from Difplaccment. I of the acetabulum, and a tumour from the round end of the bone, is felt in the groin. O. 185. Row are Di/locations of the Os Fcmoris to be treated ? A. When the head of the bone gets into the foramen ovale, the firfl: ftep in the re- duction is, to endeavour to relax the mufcles as much as poffible. Then by moderate extenfion to endeavour to difengage the end of the bone from its cavity. As foon as this is effeCied, the bone is to be drawn up- wards and inwards into its focket. A re- duction is in this manner generally effected. Unlefs the end of the bone be above the acetabulum, no extraordinary extenfion is neceffary. But when the want of fuccefs in the reduction is owing to a projecting por- tion of the acetabulum laying hold of the bone and preventing the neceffary extenfion> the bone is to be elevated above this pro- jecting part fo as to difengage it, and the' redu&ion is then eafiJy eifeCted.

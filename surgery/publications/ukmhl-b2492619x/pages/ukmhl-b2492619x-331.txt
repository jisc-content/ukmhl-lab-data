In performing this operation, the bladder mud be always in a diftended Hate, fo as to make it rife above the ofla pubis. The patient is therefore to drink plentifully of mild and diluent liquors, previous to the operation, and to retain his urine as much as poflible. He is then to be laid in a hori- zontal pofture, having the head a little lower than the pelvis. The furgeon is now to make an incifion on one fide of the linea alba, four inches long, and down to the fymphyfis pubis. Both the pyramidales mufcles are then to be feparated; then the bladder is to be cautioufly pun&ured, and an opening made into it large enough to admit of the finger being introduced, which a£ts now as a directory for the knife to enlarge the opening, fo as to admit of the calculi being extratted, which may be eafily laid hold of, either by the finger, or by a forceps invented for that purpofe. The integuments are to be immediately brought into contact, upon the calculi being re- y moved.

226 Increafed Secretions. O. 289. How is Eneurefis to be treated? A. When Eneurefis arifes from a want of tone in the fphintier of the bladder, the cure is very difficult. It is, however, to be at- tempted, by endeavouring to reftore it as much as poffible, by the ufe of bark, cold bathing, wine, and the application of blifters to the perineum. When Eneurefis arifes from the irritation of calculi, opiates and mucilaginous liquors are to be ufed. When thefe fail to give relief, a removal of the calculi by an operation becomes neceflary. When Eneurefis arifes from a laceration of parts, in performing the operation of litho- tomy, fome relief may be obtained by ufing gentle preffure, by an inftrument termed i jugum penis in the male, and by pejfaries in the female, to prefs againft the urethra. Thefe peftaries ought to be made, as already * recommended (Q. 155.), for prolapfus uteri. In cafes where the jugum penis cannot be ufed with propriety, an inftru- ment may be worn between the legs, to re- ceive the urine, as it drops from the penis. Gen. XXII. - d

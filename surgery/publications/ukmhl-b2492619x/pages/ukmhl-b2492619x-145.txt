T * ex cy Tumours from Difplacement. 13 j OSSIS MAXILLiE INFERIORIS. Dislocation of the Lower Jaw. O. 172. How is a Di/location of the Lozver fare to be treated ? A. As this Diflocation can only happen forwards and downwards, the reduftion of it is to be affe&ed by paffing both thumbs, well covered with linen cloth, into the mouth, the head being previoufly well fe- cured by an affiflant. The jaw is now to be pufhed forward and downward, until it is entirely difengaged from the ofla mali. As foon as this is effefted, the bone, by gentle preffure, will immediately fpring back into its natural fituation by the aftion of the mufcles : the thumbs are to be immediately withdrawn; when one fide is only luxated, the prelfure, in difengaging the bones, is to be applied to the luxated fide only. xa OSSIUM *

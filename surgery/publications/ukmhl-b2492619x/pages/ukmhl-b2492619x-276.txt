Lojs of Continuity. 266 admit of an inftrument for elevating the de- prefied portion of the bone. Such perfor- ations are, however, attended with more danger in fofrie parts of the cranium than in others. A complete knowledge, there- fore, of the anatomy of the head, is abfo- luteiy necefiary. The mod dangerous parts are the frontal fmufes and the back part of the occipital bone. As Toon as this opera- tion is determined to be performed, a fmall portion of the pericranium maybe removed by a fcalpel, juft equal to the modeolus of the trepan. A fmall hole is, then, to be made with a perforator, to admit of the center pin of the trepan, which ought to be of a cylindrical form. A portion of the depreffed piece may be included within the circular divifron, made by the trepan. The weight of the inftrument, during the oper- ation, is to be laid on the contiguous found bone. Several turns being now performed by the faw, the center pin is to be re- moved. The furgeon may ufe either a trepan or trephine; but the former exe- cutes the operation much quicker, and an- swers equally well, by moving it flowly and cau-

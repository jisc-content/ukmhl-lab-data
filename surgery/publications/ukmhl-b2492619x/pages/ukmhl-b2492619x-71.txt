I Q. 66. M- â€™(Vo/ Ev.cyfted Tumours. 6l To pre vent the air from preffing upon the lungs, and occafioning opprefiion to too great a degree, by its being allowed to re- main between the lungs and pleura, let the patient make a full infpiration, as loon as the canula is removed; or, let an elaf- tic bottle be applied to the wound in the pleura, and it will extraft the air into its cavity. To produce a radical cure, by exciting a certain degree of inflammation, between the lungs and pleura, fo as to produce a concretion of them, (O. 48.) is not as yet confirmed by experience. There is, however, a great probability of its fuc- ceeding, from adhefions daily taking place between them; being difcovered by defec- tion ; and yet the perfon laboured not un- der any confiderable inconvenience. Dr. Monro recommends a feton to be intro- duced into the fide, by means of a curved trocar. Allowing the feton to remain for fome days, it will produce a fufficient de- gree of inflammation.

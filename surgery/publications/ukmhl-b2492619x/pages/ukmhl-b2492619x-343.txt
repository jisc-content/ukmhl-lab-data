The preffure from the fpeculum is then to be leffened, to prevent the aqueous humour from being entirely dilfufed. A femilunar cut is now to be made in the fuperior part of the cornea, the flap of which is to be raifed by a blunt probe, which is then to be cautioufly paffed through the pupil, fo as to fcratcli a hole in the capfule of the lens, to admit of the lens efcaping.

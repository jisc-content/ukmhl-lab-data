FRACh / [ 285 ] 0 I ) FRACTURA OS SIS HUMERI. J * Fractures of Q. 349. How the Shoulder Bone. \ . are Fractures of the Os Humerus to be treated? A. After relaxing the whole of the mufcles, as much as poflible, if the frac- ture is diftinguifhed to be of an oblique direftion, fo that one of the fraCtured bones overlaps the other, a moderate degree of extenfion is to be ufed, fo as to bring the fraCtured ends, as nearly as polfible, into their natural fituation; when they are to be retained, by means of a long roller, and by Iplints, and the arm is allowed to hang* But when the fraCiure happens to occur in a tranfverfe direction, the arm is not to be allowed to hang, as it prevents the frac- tured ends from coming into contaCt. In fuch cafes, therefore, it is to be fufpended by a proper bandage, or fling, hung about the neck. An antiphlogiftic regimen is in every cafe necefiary, to prevent inflam- mation.

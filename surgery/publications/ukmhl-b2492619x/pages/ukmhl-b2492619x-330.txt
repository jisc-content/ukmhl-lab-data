Several methods have been recommended for exe- cuting this; two of which only deferve at- tention. The one is excited by cutting over the offa pubis into the body of the bladder, from whence it has been called the High Operation for Lithotomy, and the other is executed by cutting below the * pubis, befide the urethra in the perineum, from which it has been termed the Lateral Operation for Lithotomy.

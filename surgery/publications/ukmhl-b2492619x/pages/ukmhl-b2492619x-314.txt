Obfiruclions, I Var. a. suffocatio sub aqua. Syn. Drowning. Q. 371. How are per Jons apparently drowned to be treated ? 1 A. As loon as the body is taken out of the water, it fhould be covered by fome warm fubftance, as by the warm bath. Blowing air into the lungs is next to be attempted, fo as to imitate refpiration as much as poffible, by a conical tube put into the noftrils, applying at the fame time a piece of leather, or wet paper, over the mouth. Next the ftomach and inteltines are to be roufed into attion by warm li- quors, fuch as wine palfed into the ftomach by a tube in the form of a male catheter. Injeftions are generally ufed to roufe the motion of the inteftines. They may be thrown in by means of fyringes. Other ftimuli are alfo to be applied to the body. Externally friction is particularly recom- mended. AG LIE

( 8 ) May \st, 8 a. m.—Fever came on at 2 A. M. He was well all yesterday. There is now slight heat of skin. Thermometer in axilla 102°; pulse 124°; tongue slightly dry; stump looks very well; 4 more ligatures came away to-day. Removed also one or two of the mre sutures in the flaps. Discharge healthy and not profuse; moist rales in upper right chest; respiration more natural on left side. Bowels moved twice nativrally. Takes his quinine^ brandy, and food as usual. He is very cheerful, and asks to be cured quickly. 2«f?, 8 A. M.—He had no fever yesterday, but the pulse quickened to 140 in the evening. Axillary temperature 103°; tongue now clean and moist; pulse 128°; thermometer 100°; skin cool; bowels have acted three times, but not loose. Has taken his food well; several ligatures came away, only two left; all the sutures remaining removed. The flaps have nearly united; slight and healthy discharge chiefly from the glenoid cavity, rather flakey at times, as though the cartilage were disintegrating. The stump is now strapped with adhesive plaster. Continue the same diet. ^rdy 8 A. M.—He had slight fever yesterday afternoon, and 8 loose stools, for which the House Surgeon gave him some chalk mixture. Looks rather low this morning; pulse 128 to 130°; skin moist with sweat. Thermometer in axilla 9 8°; stump not looking quite so well; granulations pale. The discharge much as usual. The two last ligatures, on femoral artciy, and vein came away. There has been a change in the weather ; rain has fallen and the hot dry air (Thermometer 100 to 104°) has become damp. This is probably the cause of his not being quite so well. The chest sounds are better, rales less sonorous; moist rale in upper right chest less crepitant. Continue the same diet and stimulants.

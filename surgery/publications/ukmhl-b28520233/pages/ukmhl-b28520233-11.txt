( 3 ) He had had a good deal of paia and serous discharge. Ordered cold applications and perfect rest of the limb on a splint. The other wounds were also dressed. April V2ith.—The wound again carefully examined, and through the bruised and injured tissues the joint was felt, the point of the finger passing into it; the inner condyle of the femur roughened; fluid collecting in the joint; pulse quick; no pain. In consultation with Mr. Partridge, I decided on amputation. At 9 A. M. I removed the limb, under Chloroform, by mo- dified circular amputation at the lower third of the thigh. All bleeding points being secured, the edges of the flaps were secured by metal sutures. I observed that the muscles at the posterior aspect of the thigh had a bruised and discolored appearance. April ISlA. 8 A. M.—Is feverish; pulse 120°; no he- monhage; tongue moist. Ordered cold applications to the stump, perfect quiet, diet of milk and sago. 14^.—No fever this morning. The posterior part of the stump is gangrenous to a small^extent, corresponding to the discoloration of the muscles observed during the amputation. 16 tk The sutures have given way and the interior of the stump IS exposed. It is somewhat sloughy in appearance; the end of the bone is denuded of periosteum and necrosed; medulla discolored at the point of section, may be living below the surface. I observed during the amputation that the perios- teum and the bone were both healthy, and that the membrane adhered closely to the bone at the line of division; most of the igatures on the smaller vessels came away to day. He had slight fever yesterday evening, but has none now; pulse 100°.

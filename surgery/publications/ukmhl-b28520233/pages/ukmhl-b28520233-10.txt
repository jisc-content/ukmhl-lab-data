( 2 ) I have noticed this subject more at length in another com. munication to the “ Anualsj" but I may here remark that the present ease is a good illustration of the disease Osteo Mye- litis and the constitutional and local symptoms it gives rise to, it also clearly demonstrates the advantage of amputating above the next joint to the bone affected, provided the operation’ be performed before the systemic poisoning have gone too far. I regard the details of this case as so interesting, in both a surgical and pathological point of view, that I have not hesitated to give them in extenso, though, as a general rule, such prolixity is objectionable. It is to be remarked that the operation was performed, and the recovery occurred, at a very hot season of the year, the Thermometer ranging from 86° to 104°. Cholera and other diseases very prevalent at the time. Shekh Asghur, aged 16 years, a slight and somewhat delicate lad, a carriage driver by trade; accustomed to drink 6 or 8 ounces of Bazar spirit daily, thin, sallow-looking, and with congenital cataract in the left eye, was admitted into the Medical College Hospital on the night of the 10th April 1864, suffering from injuries sustained by a fall from a horse which trampled on, or kicked him, after he fell. He had a wound on the chin slightly exposing the bone,* one on the lip, and some smaller ones on other parts of the body. The most severe injury was on the inner aspect of the right knee-joint, the integument being torn and bruised, the muscles and tendinous structures exposed to the extent of 3^ by inches. The joint injured, but not apparently opened, though it appeared probable that the bruised tissues would slough and open it. * From which, suhsequently, a small piece of bone exfoliated.

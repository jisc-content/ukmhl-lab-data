( 12 ) There is still one sinus at the outer angle of the cicatrix, from which a small quantity of purulent discharge can be pressed. The rest of the stump is perfectly healed. He went out and had his photograph taken a few days ago. June Wth.—He has been eating sweetmeats brought in by his friends, and has diarrhoea in consequence. Ordered 01. Ricini^vi statim, chalk mixture after it. Put him on arrowroot and soup, and keep all his friends away. The dis- charge has somewhat increased, the cicatrix become oedematous, and the mouth of the sinus ulcerated to the size of a 4</. piece. He is in capital spirits, and very anxious to be about on his crutches. June \2th.—He is better to-day ; bowels natural; good ap- petite ; sinus contracting; discharge less. Let him have more to eat again. June \ ^th.—He is in excellent health ; appetite good; bowels regular; sleep sound. The sinus is still discharging, but less than it has done. The cicatrix still somewhat oedematous, but contracting daily. He was present, and walked about the room on his crutches at the last meeting of the Medical Society. June ‘i^nd.—He is getting fatter and stronger daily; goes about the hostipal on his crutches. Still the sinus is open, discharging a few drops of pus daily. June —For the last day or two the discharge has been slightly increased, and this morning I find that he has had slio-ht fever yesterday, and that there is a collection of pus at the inner angle of the stump. This I opened and gave exit to about 2 ozs. of pus. He is pretty \vell in other respects. Passed a probe into the sinus, but can detect no extraneous substance.

138 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY verify his researches, I myself repeated many of his experiments. I availed myself of this oppor- tunity of showing to my pupils some of the most fundamental of these experiments, which so pro- foundly modified the views held up to that time, as to the functions of the spinal cord. The following essay, therefore, and the lectures here published, are not a mere analytical critique. These pages contain, in truth, an experimental criticism, or critical verification of Dr. Brown- S^quard’s discoveries. In scientific progress, veri- fication is the handmaid of discovery. The humble function of the handmaid is, however, as necessary in establishing the truth of new views, as is that of the mason in constnicting an edifice designed by the most gifted architect. That the physiological researches detailed in this Part were not barren of practical results will, I trust, appear when I come to speak of injuries and diseases of the spine. “ These Lectures* contain the results of the * Course of Lectures on the Physiology and Pathology of the Central N'ervous System, delivered at the Royal College of Sur- geons of England, in May, 1858, by C. E. Brown-S6quard, M.D., F.B.S., &c. London ; Willianis and Norgate, 8vo, pp. 276, 1860.

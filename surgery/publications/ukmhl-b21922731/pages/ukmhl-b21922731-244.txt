A NEW THEORY OF 226 this experiment is a copper plate, against the back of which a steady sheet of flame is peraiitted to play. Emerging from the copper, the waves first pass through a space devoid of air, and enter a hollow glass tube three feet long and three inches wide (this, as it were, represents a nerve tubule on a large scale). The two ends of this cylinder are closed by plates of rock salt, the only solid substance offering a hardly perceptible ob- stacle to the passage of waves of heat. After passing through the tube, the radiant heat falls on one face of a thermo-electric pile. This fa- mous instrument, and not an ordinary thermome- ter, is used in these inquiries. It is used in a somewhat novel w’’ay. The current generated in this pile is a consequence of a difference of tem- perature between its two opposite faces. If, therefore, an exactly equal amount of heat be permitted to fall on the face of the pile opposite to that receiving the heat which passes through the tube, the needle of the galvanometer con- nected wdth the pile wiW. stand at zero. The needle, in fact, represents the tongue of a delicate balance perfectly adjusted; while it points to the zero marked on the circle, we may suppose the weights in each scale to be exactly equal.

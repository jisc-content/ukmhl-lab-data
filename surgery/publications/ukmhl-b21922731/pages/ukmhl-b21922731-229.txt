AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 211 liis h}’pothesis of recurrent sensibility. Now what may be the cause of the pain resulting from an irritation propagated thus centrifiigaUy along a motor, and then centripetally along a sensitive nerve 1 To this question Dr. Brown- S^quard gives a most ingenious answer. Al- though Matteucci and Dubois Reymond differ as to the explanation of the phenomenon, yet all agree that if a so-called rheoscopic frog’s leg be prepared and laid on an insulating plate, and a second leg be laid across it, so that the neiwe alone of the second is in contact with the muscles of the fii*st, a contraction produced in the first leg by galvanic or other stimulus, is followed by a secondary (or induced f) contraction in the second, and so for three or four limbs under favourable circumstances. This is due to some change in the galvanic state of the muscle, which by its contraction thus excites the nerv'e lying on it. Now Dr. Brown-St^quard supposes that this change in the galvanic state of a muscle is, in the natural condition, perceived by the sensi- tive nerves of the muscle ; and the delicate j)er- ception of this galvanic change accompanying muscular contraction, however slight, gives to us a correspondingly delicate appreciation of the

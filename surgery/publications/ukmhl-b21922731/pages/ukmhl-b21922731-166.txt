148 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY The greater part of Dr. Bro^Yn-S^quard^s lec- Experimentai f'^res are devotecl to an attempt to investigation determine with scientific precision, of the cord , , i i i difficult and ''^hat arc the exact channels m the perplexing, spinal cord and medulla oblongata through which sensitive impressions are transmit- ted and through which the influence of the will is conveyed to muscles. In making this attempt, Dr. Brown-S^quard has recourse to experimental investigation on animals, while he also tries to corroborate the conclusions thus arrived at by reference to pathological cases; and even those who may not regard his arguments as in all respects conclusive, I venture to assert, vdll not peruse his book without admitting that he gives a masterly analysis of the pathological cases liear- ing upon these questions, which lie has collect- ed from the most varied sources, with so much labour and so much care. As an experimentalist, he has disproved the assertion of one of the most eminent physiologists that these islands has ever produced, that ‘'direct experiments afford no aid in determining the functions of the columns of the spinal cord.” I freely admit that attempts to expose this organ either in living or dead animals are surrounded with difficulties, which embarrass

AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 215 central ner\*ous system is accompanied by an increase of sensibility of the surface. AVe know that when the sympathetic nerve is divided in the neck of a rabbit, the ear on the same side becomes warmer, more vascular, and more sensitive tkin the other, and that the same conse<|uences are met with, on the same side as the section, in the posterior limb, after division of a lateral half of the spinal coixl. We are therefore, at first, naturally led to suppose that in each experiment, the vaso-motor nerve fibres being divided, and the blood-vessels paralysed, the increased vascularity consequent upon this gives rise to the increase of sensibility. An exceedingly interesting experiment of Dr. Brown- St^quardâ€™s proves that in the latter instance, at all events, there is another cause for the hyperms- thesia to Ije sought for. In his paper entitled Experimental liesearches on various questions concerning Sensihilitij, read before the Royal Society, in May, 1860, he says that in a rabbit, all the parts of one of whose hind limbs were amputated, except the nerves, and in which the the toes arc, after a time, about losing their sensibility, in consequence of all circulation of blood being at an end in the limb, there Is IS

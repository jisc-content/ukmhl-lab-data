I 62 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY ous accident, punctured; there was instant loss of vision, hut no pain referable to the optic nerve, nor was the sensation of a flash of light, said to follow the lesion of this nerve, perceived by the individual. Until, therefore. Professor Schroeder van der Kolk adduces some facts in supjDort of his assumption, his argument cannot be admitted to have any real value. With reference to the decussation of sensitive T. . impressions in the spinal marrow, the spinal and the determination with preci- marrow. Gxact seat of this de- cussation, we think the experiments of Dr. Brown-S6tpiard lead to conclusions, if possible more definite than any of his other researches. It has been known indeed for centuries, that the conductors of sensitive impressions, as well as those of the impulses of the will to muscles, de- cussate somewhere in the cerebro-spinal centres, but Sir Charles Bell seems to have been the first physiologist who undertook the attempt to deter- mine the real situation of the decussation of sen- sitive conductors; though he gives no experimental proofs whatever of his idea, which was that the crossing took place in the floor of the fourth ventricle, above and very close to the decussa-

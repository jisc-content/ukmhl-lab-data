Direct experiment seems to have placed it beyond all doubt that those nerve- fibres which are ordinarily regarded as the con- ductors of sensation, cross from one side to the other in the spinal cord itself. But is it so for the conductor of all kinds of sensation”? This question cannot, 1 think, at present be answered. Let us now see how far the notions I have been speaking of receive corroboration from patho- logical facts; and first let us inquii’e does patho- logical investigation support the view that the A lesion such as we fan- cied to be indicated at 2, must be attended with par- alysis of motion on both sides, but of sensation only on that opposite to the side of the lesion ; while an in- jury such as we suppose to exist at 3, is followed by

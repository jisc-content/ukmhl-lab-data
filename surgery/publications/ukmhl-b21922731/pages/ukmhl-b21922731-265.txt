247 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. Second experiment.—I now proceed to divide, in this rabbit’s neck, the ceiwical s\Tnpathetic nerve on the right side. I need hardly say that it is an operation of some delicacy; after dividing the integument, which is fii*st sponged well with water to keep aside the hair, I draw the parts aside, using two pair of forceps; here, you see, is the carotid artery, here the pneumogastric nerve, and behind, the small filament of the s}Tnpatlietic for which I seek. 1 now divide it; and almost at once you perceive what marked effects follow. The pupil is decidedly more constricted on the side of the injury, the conjunctiva more vascular, the right ear is unmistakablv warmer than the left; this you can all perceive, for even to the hand it is too obvious to be a matter of any doubt.

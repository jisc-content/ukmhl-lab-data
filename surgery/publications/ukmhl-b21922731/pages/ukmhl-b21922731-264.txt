Second, that the chilling of a single part, such as the hand or foot, may cause a loss of temperature in all the other parts of the body, even far beyond what could have been considered likely or possible.” Edwards did not observe that the temperature of the mouth does not vary in a degree corresponding with the hand not in the bath. Had he known this fact, he would not have drawn the second conclusion just stated, nor would he, without qualification, have adopted the axiom:—“ That we cannot either raise or lower the temperature of any one part of the body, without all the other parts of the frame being affected, and suffering a corresponding rise or fall in temperature, more or less, according to circum- stances.” The real significance and true interpretation of this experiment,* which was first accurately per- formed by Drs. Brown-Sbquard and Tholozan, will become more obvious when you have wit- nessed the very striking results of the remarkable experiment I am now about to perform. * M. Vulpian, in his Legons sur I'appareil Vaso-Moteur, page 236, states that he has not obtained the same results as MJI. Tholozan and Brown-S6quard. The experiment does not give constant results.

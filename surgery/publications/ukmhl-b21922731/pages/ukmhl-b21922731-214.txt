19G CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY by the vaso-motor nervous system, admitting that many phenomena hitherto inexplicable, find, in the effects produced upon the blood-vessels by paralysis and excitation, whether direct or reflex, of this system, a complete explanation ; still the question comes, can we explain all the pheno- mena, normal and pathological, showing the direct or reflex influence of the nervous system on nutrition and secretion by deduction from the jibove truths 'I Are they all due to the effects of paralysis or excitation of the sympathetic nerve on blood-vessels % We entirely concur with the answer given to this question by Dr. Brown- S(iquard, that facts discovered by Ludwig, by Czermak, and especially by Claude Bernard, seem to have solved the question in the most positive manner. It seems absolutely certain that there is some agency of the nervous system, which is not simply an influence on the constricting muscular fibres of blood vessels, in the normal, or patho- logical, phenomena of secretion and nutrition. Professor Bernard has pointed out how that, in- stead of contracting, the blood-vessels of the salivary glands become enlarged, when certain nerves are excited. To explain this and other apparently contradictoiy facts, we must seek

At the autopsy the following morbid appear- ances were observed :—The spinous processes and laminm being removed, the theca vertebralis was found to contain between two and three drachms of serum, slightly tinged with blood; but the membranes pre.sented no appearances of inflam- mation ; the medulla spinalis seemed healthy externally; when, however, it was laid open by a longitudinal incision, its central portion was found quite softened and pulpy, from its lower extremity to the third or fourth dorsal vertebra—here the morbid condition terminated. The softening was most extensive at the lower part, and was observ- ed throughout the whole of the tract indicated. The bladder was much enlarged, and its internal surface exhibited signs of intense inflammation.

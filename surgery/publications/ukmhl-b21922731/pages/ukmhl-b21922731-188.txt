170 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY ceived by the tips of the fingers than by the knuckle, the lips, or the tip of the tongue. Thus, if a thin tube of vulcanised indian-rubber be quite filled with water and tied at lioth ends, an im- pulse, produced by letting a little hammer fall on one end, is felt at the other by the finger when the same cannot be appreciated by the lips, tongue, and other parts; if, on the contrary, the whole hand be held under water, and a gentle current be made to pass from a pipe tlmough the water, the striking of the current on the hand is felt at a greater distance from the pipe by the back of the hand than by the palm. If ether or spirit be applied to the surface, and a draught of air made to play upon the parts, the cold produced will be felt veiy differently by different parts of the body; if a needle or pin be made to pass through a small disk of cork, so that a very little of the point projects, the pricking with this small point will be more delicately appreciated in some parts than in others ; and if the front of the fore- arm be irritated by the application of a sinapism for a few minutes, we can easily satisfy ourselves by comjiarison with the other forearm, that, so far as regards pricking, the sinapism has produced lyqieraesthesia.

LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 256 and side of the head coiTesponding with the section. 3rd. You all saw how remarkable was the controlling influence exercised over the pulsations of the heart by galvanizing the pneumogastric nerves. Each of these experiments is illustrative of the influence of the nervous system over the vascular. They have foimed the bases of physiological theories very widely diflering from each other, and have been the starting-points for other, per- haps less striking, but not less valuable experi- ments, bearing upon the same subject. The muscular tunic of the vessels which ramify through the body places them under the control of the nervous system as completely as that of the heart itself. As the muscular stiâ€™ucture of the heart, so the muscular structure of the vessels is subject to emotional and reflex influences. It is not only the blood-vessels of the cheeks which blush: the greater development of the muscular tunic in the vessels of glands and of the brain, shows that in those situations the arrangements for controlling the blood-supply are even more complete than elsewhere. It is true that it has long been known that intimate relations exist be-

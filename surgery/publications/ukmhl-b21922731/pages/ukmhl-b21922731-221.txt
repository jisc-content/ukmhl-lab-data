A>0) PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 203 way he offers an explanation of the attacks of epilepsy and epileptiform seizures, resulting from organic lesion of the nerv^ous centres. The researches of Dr. Brown-S4quard concern- ing the etiology and nature of epilepsy, are known to all the world, while his production of artificial epUeptiform attacks in animals as the result of lesion of the spinal cord, and the very remarkable discovery that the offspring of animals thus rendered epileptic, frequently acquire, by hereditary descent, the same aftection, are facts no less interesting to the naturalist than to the physiologist. But this subject, which, with that of rotatory convulsions, is discussed in his two final lectures, it is not my intention to enter upon. 1 shall content myself with observing that they are lectures of great practical value, and show in every line the extraordinary importance of studying, in all their varied aspects and com- plex forms, the phenomena of reflex excitability. In reviewing the principal of such phenomena, I cannot but admit that the best physical expla- nation of them hitherto given, seems to be that through the action of the vaso-motor nerves on the blood-vessels of the nervous centres. Bonders, and his pupil. Van der Beke Callenfels, have

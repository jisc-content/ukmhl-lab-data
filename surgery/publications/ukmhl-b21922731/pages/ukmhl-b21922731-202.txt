184 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY the cold water, the more the temperature was di- minislied in the hand left in the air. But other proofs are not wanting to show that the action of the nervous system is, in this way, sufficient to diminish the calibre of the blood-vessels. I liave myself performed the following modifica- tion of the foregoing experiment. A bat is placed upon a small piece of board, and fastened with both wings fully expanded, so that one, say the right, can be readily inspected with a micro- scope. As the wel) of the bat’s wing is generally too much darkened witli pigment to admit of very precise observation of the blood-vessels, it is necessary to peel off some of the epidermis, whicli is easily done by seizing a portion of it with a pair of forceps over one of the metacai-pal rihs of the wing and so tearing gently off a small por- tion. In the portion thus denuded, an artery and accompanying vein are to be sought, and the for- mer accurately measured with an eye-piece micro- meter. If then a small muslin bag of snow, or pounded ice and salt, be applied to the other wing, in a short time we may observe the artery under observation diminishing very remarkably in calibre—and indeed, under favouralde circumstan- ces, becoming almost entirely closed, as I have

LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOCiY 318 wlieu 1 slightly irritate the skin of the cheek on the same side as the injury, you see a convulsion sets in. The eye on the same side is first affected, then the posterior limbs—now it becomes general; you see the entire frame is convulsed, and the muscles of the jaw open and shut the mouth spasmodically, iis in epilepsy ; respiration is nearly cpiite arrest- ed ; it now begins again—at first it is diaphrag- matic ; now the animal has recovered. This, gentleman, is, indeed, a very marvellous and highly instructive experiment. An injury indicted on the spinal cord has given rise to a reflex modification of nutrition in a remote part. The cornea has become opaque : the functions of the nerve of the cheek have been so altered, that irritation of it induces a complete epileptic seizure. But, more remarkable still, if this portion of the skin over the jaw be destroyed by excision or cauterization, or if the nerves of it be cut, then the animal is cured and no more fits can be ex- cited. But we owe to Brown-S(5quard yet an- other remarkable discovery connected with the production of epileptiform convulsion ; this is the occurrence of convulsive movements of a rotatory character, from irritation of the auditory nerve.

210 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY US to suppose that, in the living organism, analo- gous molecular changes, altogether independent of the blood-vessels, may give rise to many of the phenomena in question ? In such cases, we con- fess that analogy is an unsafe guide, but, on the other hand, it is difficult, if not impossible, not to be led some little way by it. In conclusion I wish briefly to discuss two topics already alluded to; Istly, as to the muscular sense, i.e., the appreciation of the feeling which accompanies muscular contraction, and which, in its exaggerated condition, constitutes the ex- cruciating suffering which attends cramp and various muscular spasms; and 2ndly, as to the hypereesthesia which foUows the section of a lateral half of the spinal cord in the posterior limb, on the same side as the lesion. Magendie discovered, in 1839, that irritation Muacular anterior or motor roots of the sense, pain spinal nerves causes pain, and fur- attending 1 1 1 n T cramp and when these roots are di- spasm. vided, irritation of the distal extrem- ity only gives pain; while if the posterior roots of the corresponding spinal nerves be next cut across, pain no longer results from the irritation just mentioned. On these facts Magendie founded

278 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY amazing intricacies and difficulties which surround the subject, make it necessary that we should ex- amine with the greatest possible care the facts and experiments upon which hi^ theories are based. I shall hope to show you before the end of this lecture, not only some of the fundamental ex- periments from which the deductions of Brown- S^quard are cbawn, but also that his researches have been tested by myself and others, by a most rigidly exact process. I shall exhibit to you the spinal cords of animals upon which Brown-S^quard operated in this theatre about two years ago. Some of those present witnessed the experiments to which I allude, and had an opportunity of ob- serving the symptoms which I noted at the time, and afterwards connected with the precise lesion of the cord, when this organ had been rendered hard by immersion in spirit. Let me remind you that, until quite recently, since the researches of Brown-S^quard, Lockhart Clarke, and others, have changed our views, there were two rival theories regarding the func- tions of the spinal marrow: one, that of Sir Charles Bell, as modified by Longet; the other, that of Van Deen, adopted with some modifica- tion by Valentine, Stilling, and others.

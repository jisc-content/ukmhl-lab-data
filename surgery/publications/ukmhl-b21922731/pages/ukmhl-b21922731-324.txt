On the contrary, by an exaltation of this muscular sense, in certain conditions, muscular contraction be- comes frightfully painful; hence the agony which so often accompanies spasm and cramp, colic and uterine contraction. Magendie, in 1839, discovered that irritation of the anterior or motor roots of the spinal nerves causes pain; but further, that when these roots are divided, that irritation of the distal extremity only gives pain; if, then, the posterior roots of the corresponding spinal nerves be cut across, pain no longer results from the u’ritation just mentioned. On these facts Magendie founded his hypothesis of recurrent sensibility. Now, what may be the cause of the pain resulting from an irritation propagated thus centrifugally along a motor nerve, and then centripetally along a sen- sitive 1 To this question Brown-S^quard gives a most ingenious answer.

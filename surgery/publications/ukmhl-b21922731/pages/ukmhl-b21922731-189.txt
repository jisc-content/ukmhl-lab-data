AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 171 These ob\’ious facts place within our reach means, at once ready and tolerably precise, for making comparisons between s)*mmetrical and other parts of the surface; but for measuring the degree of tactile sensibility, perhaps the best metJiod of all is that indicated by Dr. Brown-S^quard in his Experimental Researches. The curious facts discovered by E. H. AVeber, respecting tactile sensibility, are well known, lie found that if the blunted points of a pair of compasses are applied simultaneously on the skin, there is, according to circumstances, either the sensation of one or of two points. When tlie points are both inside of certain boundaries, they ai*e felt as one only; when they are outside of these boundaries, both are felt. These boundaries vaiy exceedingly in ditl’ereut parts of the skin ; but for a given part the differ- ences between various individuals are not con- siderable. The compiis.ses may Ixi made use of for measuring the degree of tactile sensibility in morbid states. In a case of considerable anies- thesia of the lower limbs, the patient only felt a single impression on one leg, although the points of the compass were ten, fifteen, or even twenty centimetres apart; whilst on the other leg he could

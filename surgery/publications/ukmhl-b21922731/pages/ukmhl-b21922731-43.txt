LECTURE I. 29 observes that no conclusion can be drawn from destruction of a sore at a time wlien it cannot be determined whether it is a simple or syphi- litic venereal sore. If, after its destruction, the patient escapes without constitutional symp- toms, it may be inferred that the sore was from the first non-infecting. It appears, therefore, that after it is recog- nisable as a syphilitic sore, it is not ubortiblc. To excise it or cauterize it is only to lock the stable-door after the horse is stolen. Among the causes which have involved the study of syphilis in doubt and darkness must be reckoned the tendency which it has to form hybrids witli other maladies. In its latter forms syphilis may be seen masked and modi- fied by scrofula, rheumatism, scurvy, gout. We know that the vaccine virus and that of syphilis may be put into the soil together—the tares with the wheat—and it is probable that venereal poisons themselves may in like manner become mixed, and thus producing a compound infection, give rise to complications of symp- toms almost impossible to disentangle.

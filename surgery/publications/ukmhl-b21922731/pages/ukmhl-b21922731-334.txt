LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 1316 sioii, at present, tliat it is a more easy matter to pro- duce artificially au epileptic access l>y acting upon the blood than upon the neiYes or the brain/’ The well-known experiments of Sir Astley Cooper, published in the fii’st volume of Guy’s Hospital Reports, on the effect of tying the carotid and vertebral arteries, have had their value much in- creased by the recent researches of Kussmaul and Tenner in the same line of investigation. It is, indeed, very gratifying to see how much harmony exists between the views of these last-named authors and Brown-S^cj^uard, each arriving at their conclusion through channels of investigation quite distinct from the other. An interruption in the conveyance of arterial blood to the lirain in warm-blooded animals produces an epileptic fit, and there is the same result whether this interruption be due to haemorrhage, ligature of the great vessels in the neck, or to a contraction of the vessels of the brain through the action of the vaso-motor nerves. That convulsions epi- leptiform in character may arise from causes totally distinct from deficient supply of blood to the brain is quite certain; thus, poisons in the blood, for instance, cause various forms of tetanic and epileptiform convulsions. But reflex influ-

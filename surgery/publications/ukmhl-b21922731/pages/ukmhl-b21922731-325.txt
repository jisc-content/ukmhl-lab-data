APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 307 and Du Bois Eeymond differ as to the explanation of the phenomenon, yet all agree that if a so- called rheoscopic frog’s leg be prepared and laid on an insulating plate, and a second leg laid across it, so that the nerce alone of the second is in contact with the muscles of the first, a contraction pro- duced in the first leg, by galvanic or other stimu- lus is followed by a secondary or {induced?) contraction in the second, and so for three or four limbs under-favourable circumstances. This is due to some change in the galvanic state of the muscle, which, by its contraction, thus excites the ner\'e lying on it. Now Brown-S^quard supposes that this change in the galvanic state of a muscle is, in the natural condition, perceived by the sensitive ner\’es of the muscle; and the delicate perception of this galvanic change ac- companying muscular contraction, however slight, gives to us a correspondingly delicate apprecia- tion of the feeling of weight, which is one of the most striking phases of the so-called “ muscular sense.” The more ^'iolent the contraction, the more marked is the disturbance of the galvanic equilibrium, and consequently the more distinct and strong the impression conveyed to the central nervous system; normally these contractions arc

AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 149 the experimenter, and weaken the force of his in- ferences. The depth at which the spinal cord is situated in most vertebrate animals, its extreme excitability, the intimate connections of its va- rious parts vdth one another, so that one can scarcely be irritated without the others being affected, the proximity of the roots of its nerves to each other, the difficulty of stimulating one portion of the cord itself without affecting either the anterior or posterior roots, are great impedi- ments to accurate experiments; and when we consider these difficulties, we see a sufficient ex- planation of the discrepancies which are apparent in the recorded results of experiments under- taken by so many able observ^ers. But these difficulties, great though they un- questionably are, are not insurmountable; they reflect, indeed, great honour upon liim who has done so much to overcome them, but they also teach how slow we ought to be in admitting proofs upon this subject, drawn from experi- mental sources; and with what caution and care we should examine the tests to which such ex- perimental enquiries have been submitted, before we can accord to their results, as stated by any investigator, our sanction and belief. The tests

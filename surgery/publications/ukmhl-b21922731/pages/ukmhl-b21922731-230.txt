212 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY feeling of weight, which is one of the most striking phases of the so-called “muscular sense.” The more violent the contraction, the more marked is the disturbance of the galvanic equilibrium, and consequently the more distinct and strong the impression conveyed to the central nervous system. Normally these con- tractions are unaccompanied by pain, but if the muscular contraction be very violent, or if the centripetal nerves of muscle lie in a hypersesthetic condition, pain results, and hence that accompany- ing spasm and cramp. In support of this view Dr. Brown-S(5quard gives the following experi- ment : If we fix a thread to the tendon of a muscle of a frog, and attach to this thread a weight capable of entirely preventing the con- traction of the muscle, which is fixed by its other extremity, we find that ever}’- time the muscle tends to contract, there is an excitation of the nerve lying upon it, and a contraction of the muscle to which this nerve is distributed. Hence it is not necessary for muscle to contract in order to produce in nerves in contact with it a galvanic excitation. It is sufficient that they tend to contract. Now it is found that the greater

LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 248 cretion of the lachrymal gland is so increased, that it has wet the cheek. We find, in short, that division of the sympa- thetic nerve in the neck produces paralysis of the coats of the blood-vessels of the corresponding half of the head ; that the dilated vessels conse- quently permit a great afflux of fflood; that great vascularity, increase of heat, augmentation of secretion, and, in brief, very vigorous nutrition of the parts, are the general result. We owe to the illustrious Claude Bernard the discovery of the principal results due to division of the cervical portion of the s}â€™mpathetic: assu- redly the discovery is one in which experimental physiology has reason to triumph, for it must be recrarded as one of the most valuable disclosures of modern science. It cements together the vast number of isolated facts, which, since the days of Prochaska and Eobert Whytt, have been accumu- lating upon the hands of physiologists, but which, in the length and breadth of their importance, even Marshall Hall himself did not appreciate. But let us turn to the other half of this experi- ment; let me remind you that Dr. Brown-S4quard in America, Professor Claude Bernard in Paris, and Dr. Augustus Waller in England, almost

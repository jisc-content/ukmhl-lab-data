APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 279 ing to the tbeor}â€™ of Bell and Longet, the posterior columns were centripetal conductors, conveying on to the brain the sensitive impres- sions brought in by the corresponding posterior nerve-roots; the anterior and lateral columns were centrifugal conductors, conveying from the brain to the anterior or motor nerve-roots the commands of the will thus to Ije transmitted to the muscles ; while the grey matter of the cord was supposed to be solely the dynamical or force- generating portion, taking no j>art in the con- ducting of neurility, either sensitive or motor. Van Deen, on the other hand, and the others whom I have named, all atjreed in assiffuino; to the gi-ey matter the function of conducting impressions, Stilling, to whose re.searches in anatomy, physiology, and pathology we owe so much, held that sensitive impressions were con- veyed to the lirain ciiietly through the posterior half of the grey matter of the spinal medulla. Let us now see how far experimental research has Ijeeu able to throw light on this (piestion. Tt would not be possible for me to show in a lecture-room all the experiments by which Brown- S<5quard hopes to prove his two main proposi- tions ; first, that the transmission of sensitive 19

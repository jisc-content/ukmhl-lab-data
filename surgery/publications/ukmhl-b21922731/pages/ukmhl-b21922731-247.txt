It is known that the attenuation of the odorous matter of perfumes is almost infinite, how incon- ceivably minute therefore is the material change in the contents of the tube, which, notwithstand- ing, yields .such striking results in the wave absorption. The change within a ner\â€™c tubule resulting from the use of santonin, etc., or from exhaustion and other causes, can readly be conceived to intercept certiiin waves of motion, although the material change may be far beyond the reach of chemical re.search, and capable in many instances of such speedy repair as to cause some of the resulting phenomena to l>e very transient. A neive which has l^een for a time in action exerci- sing its proper function, Ijecomes in some degree incapacitated by undergoing a subtile molecular

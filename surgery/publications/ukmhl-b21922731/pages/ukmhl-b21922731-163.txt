AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 145 generating element of this nervous centre. The human mind loves systems, and it found in this theory something so simple and so seductive as to be almost irresistible. Yet now it must be set aside, and recorded in the histoiy^ of physi- ology with many other brilliant but deceptive doctrines. Van Deen has propounded, and Valentin, Stil- ling, and otheis have, with various modifications, adopted a theory in one respect fundamentally differing from the foregoing—they assign to the grey matter the function of conducting impres- sions. According to Stilling, whose beautiful re- searches in anatomy, physiology, and pathology, have done so much for science, the posterior half of the grey substance of the spinal marrow is the channel for the transmission of sensitive im- pressions to the encephalon. Moreover, accord- ing to his theory, there is no determinate and invariable course for sensitive impreasions, which may pass equally well by either lateral portions of gi’ey matter ah-cady indicated. Indeed, Stil- ling holds that a very small jxtrtion of the grey matter is still sufficient to permit the transmis- sion of sensitive imjjressions coming from parts situated behind the lesion. Although this theory

18G CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY connexions and relations of the sympathetic to the cerebro-spinal axis had, it is true, been already toleraldy well investigated by anatomists; but the presiding influence exercised over the heart, blood-vessels, and indeed, over involuntary mus- cular fibre generally, by the nervous system, had not been studied with success by physiologists ; tlie vast importance of the s}Tnpathetic system in its union with the cerebro-spinal axis had not been fully recognized, nor had any real attempt been made to explain many of the principal phe- nomena connected with nutrition, secretion, ani- \ mal heat, etc., which are now regarded as being under the control of the vaso-motor system of nerves. It is not possible to do more than allude to some of the leading hypothe.ses which have of late been put forward, with reference to the influence of the entiiâ€™e nervous system upon blood-vessels, or (as I have already stated in more general terms) upon involuntary muscular fibre, whether in the heart, blood-ves- .sels, intestines, or elsewhere. One of the hypotheses in question appears to us as novel and startling, as it does speculative and untenable, and were it not that it is associated with the name of one of the most eminent experi-

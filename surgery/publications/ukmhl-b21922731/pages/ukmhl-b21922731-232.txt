Of the first we have a fami- liar example in the great sensitiveness of a portion of the skin irritated by the application of a sinapism; the peripheral expansions of the nerves seem to become, in consequence of the greater supply of blood, more acutely sensitive to impressions made upon them—to undergo, in fact, an exaltation of function. Of the se- cond we have an illustration in the increased sensibility, which forms so striking a symptom of the early stages of cerebro-spinal meningitis. In this case, the increased vascularity of the

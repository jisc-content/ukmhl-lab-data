AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 197 for some theory embracing a wider generaliza- tion than any hitherto propounded. As I have already said, the notion of Dr. Brown-S^quard that this enlargement in the blood-vessels must be due to a greater attraction of the arterial l)lood by the tissue of the gland, seems to me a mere change of terms, explaining nothing. In- deed it leaves physiology as regards these pheno- mena in very much the same position as did Prochaska, whose observ'ations on “ The action of nerves on ves.sels and their fluids ” are both in- teresting and instructive. “ Another function of the nerves,” says this most acute observer, “ consists in a certain power over the blood-vessels, and specially the capil- laries, in virtue of which, when the nerves are stimulated (?) they excite, in that part in which they are distributed, a much more copious accu- mulation of blood than would have taken place in the normal condition of the circulation. Stohl termed it the tide of the microcosmic sea, or the (*bl) and flow of the blood—one cause of it is a stimulus of the nerves. Innumerable phenomena of daily occurrence show this. Thus a stimulus to the nerves is the cause why the cheeks, ears, and nose becomes intensely red and a sense of

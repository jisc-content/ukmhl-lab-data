116 LECTUKES ON VENEKEAL DISEASES. read Astruc’s account of tliese, written some- thing more than a century ago. He says— “ 1st. Of the great mercurial unction.” “ A full regular spitting being once raised, the second stage of the cure commences, of which we shall now speak. “ We call that a full regular spitting in which a thick, tenacious, viscid, and pituitary saliva flows out of the mouth to the quantity of five or six pints in twenty-four hours. But I would not be understood to mean this at the begin- ning or at the end of a salivation, when the split- ting is not in so great pdeiity, but at the height of the j)tyalism, when I think the regular dis- charge ought to be from three to six pints. If the discharge is less than three pints it will be too small, and not conquer the disease, unless it be continued beyond the usual number of days. If it exceeds the bounds of six pints it will be too violent, and not be borne by the patient for a sufficient time to get the better of the dis- temper. If the ptyalism keeps within due bounds it is neither to be encouraged nor re- strained, but to be kept to the same height for fifteen, eighteen, tw’enty or twenty-five days, as it shall be more or less plentiful.”

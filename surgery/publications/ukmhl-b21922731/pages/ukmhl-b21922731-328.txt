LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 310 Bernard, Cliauveau, Eckhard, Dr. C. B. Ead- clifie, etc.; and, third, that of the electrical con- ditions of membranes, glands, and blood, intro- duced by Downe, pursued by Wallaston, Young, and Baxter. In investigating the phenomena of disease accompanied by convulsion, spasm, or cramp, it is obviously the second that chiefly must engage our attention; and, thanks to the ingenuity of those who have laboured in this field of discovery, the laws connected with the electrical properties of nerve and muscle are now pretty distinctly formularized. First Experiment.â€”The galvanometer on the table, which is a tolerably delicate one, is con- nected by wires with zinc troughs, which, as you see, are filled with a saturated solution of sulphate of zinc. Over the edge of the troughs are laid pads of blotting paper, which dip into the solution; and you observe that when I bridge over the interval from one vessel to the other, by laying on this cushion of blot- ting paper, wet in the solution, the needle of the galvanometer does not move in the least; the arrangement is therefore ready for experi- ment. If, instead of the cushion of wet blot-

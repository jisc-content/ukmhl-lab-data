1 40 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY ing opinions and views which some twenty or thirty yearn ago were regarded as perfectly established, we, indeed, perceive the folly of at- tempting to dogmatize upon such questions. If we turn to the Report on the Physiology of the Xervous System, presented to the British Asso- ciation at its Cambridge meeting in 1833, by Dr. W. C. Henry, of Manchester, we find that although this was the work of a most careful and accomplished gentleman, many theories were assumed by him as having been, at that time, unquestionably proved, which are now over- turned. In the concluding recapitulation of that report, as among the “ most important facts that have been fully ascertained in the physiology of the nervous system,” the author asserts that the function of the spinal cord is simply that of a conductor of motive impulses from the brain to nerves supplying the muscles, and of sensitive impressions from the surface of the body to the sensorium commune ; and that these two vital offices reside in distinct portions of the spinal meduUa—the propagation of motion in its ante- rior columns, the transmission of sensation in its posterior columns.

218 A NEW THEORY OF phenomena, it has been supposed that there exists in every nerve groups of distinct conduc- tors, each adapted to convey along it distinct nervous impressions. This hypothesis is indeed that which is at the present time adopted by physiologists, and it numbers among its supporter the most distin- guished philosophers. Dr. Brown-S4quard conceives that he has ascertained that, beside the four distinct kinds of nerve fibres of the higher senses, there are at least eleven kinds of nerve fibres in the spinal cord, and in the cranial, spinal, and sympathetic nerves.'’ He enumerates these eleven kinds as follows:— 1st. Conductors of impressions of touch. 2nd. >9 99 of tickling. 3rd. 99 of pain. 4th. 99 99 of temperature. 5 th. 99 99 of muscular con- 6th. Incito-motor conductors. [traction. 7th. Incito-nutritive and secretory conductors. 8th. Voluntary motor conductors. 9th. Involuntary motor conductors. 10 th. Vaso-motor conductors. 11th. Nutritive and secretory conductors.

VI PREFACE. The autlior lias always agreed witli the illus- trious Marshall Hall in thinking that “ to be good practitioners, we should strive to be good ph3'’siologists,” and he attaclies an extreme value to the works of those who like Marshall Hall, Robert Todd, Sir B. Brodie and others, are in themselves connecting links between science and practice. The best preparation for tlie study of the phenomena of disease is the careful study of the phenomena of life and health. l^ractitioners are every day becoming more learned in physiology, and more anxious and better able to apply physiological ideas to the practice of their art ; therefore they may be the more willing to excuse the apparent incon- gruity of a work consisting, when complete, of physiological and practical elements apparently little related to each other. Each part, how- ever, the author hopes to make more or less complete in itself. 14, Lower Perabroke-street, Dublin, January, 1871.

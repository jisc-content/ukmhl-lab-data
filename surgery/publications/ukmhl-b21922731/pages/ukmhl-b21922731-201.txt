AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 183 undertaken with the intention of trying whether Dr. W. F. Edwards was right in his assertion, that if the temperature of one part of the body be raised or lowered, a corresponding rise or fall takes place, more or less, in all other parts of the body, according to circumstances. This assertion is found quite true in one sense; yet in exactness to l)ear an interpretation quite different from that put upon it by Edwards. Drs. Brown-S(5quard and Tholozau found that if one hand was plunged in water at the tempera- ture of its freezing point, a ver}â€™ strong lowering action was exercised on the temperature of the other hand ; while a thermometer placed in the mouth indicated but slight diminution of heat. Thus, in one case, the hand kept in the atmos- phere lost, in seven minutes, 22'* Fahrenheit, while the temperature of the mouth was not diminished more than the fifth of a degree. One therefore cannot hesitate to admit that this cool- ing of the hand in the atmosphere was produced by a contraction of the blood-vessels, due to an action on the nervous system, and not to general loss of temperature affecting the blood of the sys- tem generally. Besides, it was obser\^ed that the greater the pain produced in the arm immersed in IS

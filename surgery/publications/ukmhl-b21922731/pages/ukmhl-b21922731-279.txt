APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 261 For my part, I cannot comprehend the possibility of active dilatation of a hollow tube, as, for in- stance, a portion of intestine; and that the dis- tinguished physiologist in question feels the difficulty of maintaining the position which he has biken up, is obvious from his own words. “ For," he says, “ according to all received no- tions up to the pre.sent time, contraction is the active or tonic state of all tissues; but to consider the opposite condition as an}’thiug but a passive effect, will probably appear a paradox at first to most physiologists ; nor are we prepared at pre- sent to explain the manner in which this active enlargement of the vessels is effected." The theory of PHiiger on this subject is, to say the least, exceedingly ingenious. He fancies that as there is one set of nerves through which mus- cular tissue is excited to action, so there is a second set which exercises a control over this action, and checks it (the “ hemmungs nerven system," or inhibitory system of nerves) ; that, in short, one set is like the whip, the other like the rein of the rider ; that, as for instance in our ex- periment upon the heart, while one kind of uerv'ous influence lashes it into action, the galva- nizing of the pneumogastric curbs and stops its

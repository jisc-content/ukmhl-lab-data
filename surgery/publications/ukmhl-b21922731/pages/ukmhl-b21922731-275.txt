APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 257 tween organs more or less remote from each other. The term sympathy has long Ijeen in use, and equally applied to the healthy functional activity as to the pathological disturbances of organs distinct from each other. In the eyes of the practitioner the morbid sympathies (or reflex disturbances), such as occur in teething chiltlren, or later in life from irritation of the gastro-intes- tinal or genito-urinary systems, etc., have natu- rally eclipsed in interest the nomnd physiological sympathies, such as that between the uterus and mammary gland, the mucous membrane of the tongue, and the salivary glands, etc. But be it remembered that they are closely kindred pheno- mena, similar in mechanism, and in fact often passing into each other so gradually that it is impossible to say when the normal terminates and the morbid Ijegins. Histology and physiology have of late years curtailed the power of the so-styled “ great sym- pathetic.” While the latter makes it subseiwient to the cerebro-spinal system of which it is a depend- ant, histology has extended its domains. Peripheral ganglionic expansions have been demonstrated where they were previously unknown ; and yet the entire ganglionic system seems to have a pre-

G LECTUllES ON VENEREAL DISEASES. and cliaricre were the effects of the same poison. Later, Mr. Abernethy fell into the equally great error of believing that diseases which got well without the use of mercury were not syphilitic. As some confusion has arisen among writers on this subject from the nomenclature of these diseases, I would propose that hereafter clinical teachers in this country should adopt the names used in the report of the Venereal Committee. According to this report, venereal disease pre- sents itself in two forms—gonorrhoea, and sores or ulcers. Of venereal sores or ulcers tliere are two species, one of which affects the consti- tution, while the other docs not. They are termed syphilitic and simple. It is a pity that the term “ small pox ” is pre-occupied. If we could call the syphilitic sore the “ great,” and the simple venereal sore the “ small ” pox, we should at least have good Saxon words to indicate the formidable pro- portions of the one disease as compared with the other. Indeed they might be very well designated on this principle—“ the big and the little pox ”—were it not that in truth we have too many names already.

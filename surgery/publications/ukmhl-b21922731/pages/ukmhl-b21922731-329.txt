APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 311 ting paper, I place between the pads a portion of muscle, so that the transverse section of it touches one pad (a), and the outside of the muscle, that is its longitudinal section, touches the other—then, <is you now see, the needle is strongly deflected, and indicates a current pass- ing from the transverse towards the longitudinal part of the muscle (in the direction of the arrow). Now, to make certain that our experiment is really successful, let me reverse the portion of muscle on the pads, and after allowing the needle to come to re.st, see what effect is produced. You see it again moves nearly 20°, but in the opposite direction from the former experiment. Although I have used the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog to show you this muscular current, you must not suppose that it is confined to the muscle of any one animal. Du Boi.s Rejinond ha.s ol)serv'ed the current between the longitudinal and transverse sections in the muscles of man (muscles of an amputated leg), in thase also of the rabbit, guinea-pig, mouse, pigeon, sparrow, tortoise, lizard, adder, slow-worm, frog, toad, salamander, tench, etc. Second Experiment.—I have here the gastroc- 21

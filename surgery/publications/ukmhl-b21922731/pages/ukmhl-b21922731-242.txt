A NEW THEORY OF 224 entails more or less incapacity for conveying im- pressions like those whereby the nerve has been exhausted, until a certain i^mount of repair has been accomplished. As I conceive, the analogy lies chiefly in this : as we know, various solid and liquid bodies exercise a selective absorption both for heat and light, in virtue of which certain rays are set ajDart to be stopped, whde certain others are allowed to proceed; after an analogous fashion, certain nerves exercise a so-called selective power, per- mitting certain undulations to proceed, w^hile those of a different wave length are intercepted. Most substances, including those that are trans- parent for light, are generally opaque for dark heat of great wave length and small refrangibility. So we have no reason to think that heat can excite in the retina undulations capable of being propagated by the optic nerve to the sensorium, although light certainly does so. Instead of supposing, like Dr. Brown-S^quard, that there exist a great number of distinct con- ductors, I should suppose that there are a gxeat number of distinct sensations propagated along the nerve tubules, in molecular oscillations of different varieties or various wave lengths..

There is no sign of pain; iDut immediately the animal is seized ^vdth a convulsive movement, which causes it to roll over and over like a cylinder, constantly in the same direction, viz., towards the side on which the nerve has Ixien touched. Even the eyes have, as you see, the same tendency—one l^eing dniwn down and the other up. You are, no doubt, aware that turning or rolling movements occur as the re.sult of several injuries of portions of the enceph- alic mass, as of the optic tLalamus, eras cerelu-i, processus cerel)clli ad pontem, but the tendency to rotate as a consequence of irritiition of the auditory neiwe, presents points for consideration of even more practical interest. We now see an explanation of the vertig<» sometimes produced by injections of cold water into the ear, and of the convulsive atiections dependant on irritation of tlie acou-stic nerve. Cases of convulsions in children have l)een re- ported by Mr. Hinton, Avithout any other altera- tion being observ'cd after death, save in the ear. I would gladly, gentlemen, enlarge much mon:* upon this fascinating topic, lait it has been my

A XEW THEORY OF 230 change ; it becomes, as it were, like the air in the tube, when pervaded by the molecules of per- fume ; as it re-integrates itself from nutritive ma- terials brought by the Ijlood, it recovers its original ability to conduct imj^ressions. Were we to accept Mr. Herbert Spencer’s inter- pretation of the experiment, made by rubbing a portion of the surface of the body and after- wards perceiving what seems to be increased tem- perature of the water of the bath, as a crucial test of the existence of separate conductors for tactile and thermic impressions, we should be forced to admit, on similar grounds, an absolutely infinite variety of conductor for all sorts of impressions. There is no essential difference between this ex- periment and a vast multitude of others. When the hot water of the bath touches the surface of the body, a compound sensation results—partly tactile, partly thermic. The part which has been rubbed has by action undergone exhaustion and a consequent molecular change within its structure, which causes the tactile vibrations to be inter- cepted, while the thermic vibrations all pass on to the sensorium gndng the sensation of greater heat in the part rubbed.

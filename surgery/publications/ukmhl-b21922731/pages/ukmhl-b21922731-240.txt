A NEW THEOKY OF 222 I advocate this undulatoiy theory of sensation in preference to the theory of distinct conductors; Istly. Because it is simple. 2ndly. Because it is strongly supported by analogy, when compared with wave propagations in other departments of science. 3rdly. Because it appears to be in harmony with a large number of recognized physiological facts, which seem inex- phcable upon the theory of distinct conductors. 1st. When compared with the theoiy of dis- tinct conductors, the undulatory theory is obviously simpler as regards anatomical detail. Anatomy has not given any evidence that in an ordinary compound nerve there exist different kinds of conductorsâ€”to the highest powers of the microscope all such tubules are identical in appearance. Nay more; we now know that nerves may be so spheed (if I may use the ex- pression) on to one another, that sensitive neiwes may be made continuous with those which con- vey the commands of the will to muscles. As regards the analogy between this theory of

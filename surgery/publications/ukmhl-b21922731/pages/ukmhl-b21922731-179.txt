AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 161 to other contradictor)' portions of the book, the insufficiency of Professor Schroeder van der Kolk’s argument as regards the physiological properties of the spinal marrow. In the main it comes to this: the grey matter is itself not sensitive, it is therefore inconceivable that it can conduct sensitive impressions; or again, a nerve which conveys sensitive impressions is itself very sensi- tive to pain ; the grey matter is not sensitive to pain, therefore it cannot convey sensitive impres- sions. There Is not the least ground for admit- ting such an inference. To lie sensitive to pain, and to be capable of conve)dng sensitive impres- sions, are distinct functions, not of necessity co-existing in the same parts of the nervous system. Because they co-exist in the nerves of the trunk and limbs, it does not follow the same should necessarily be the case in the grey matter ; it certainly cannot be granted as an assumption, indeed several considerations lead one to the very reverse conclusion. We know, for instance, that the optic ners’e, which undoubtedly conveys im- pressions received from light, is itself not sensitive when cut or punctured—or at least, if sensitive at all, very slightly so. I have myself known of a case in which the optic ner\'e was, by a curi-

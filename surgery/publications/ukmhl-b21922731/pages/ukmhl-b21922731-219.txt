AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 201 is proj^agated to the spinal cord, which reflects it upon the roots of the cervdcal s}Tnpathetic nerv'c, by which it reaches the blood-vessels of the retina, produces their contraction, and as a con- sequence of this cause of diminution in the amount of blood, an amaurosis. If, instead of the reflex action of the blood-vessels, there is an action on the tissues, as in the case of the experi- ments of Czermak and of Profe&sor Bernard, the l)lood-ve.ssels dilate, and more blood passes through them. The cornea, for instance, is irritated : its centripetal nerve-fibres transmit the irritation to the pons Varolii, which reflects it upon the retina, the lachr}Tnal gland, the con- junctiva, etc.; more blood is attracted by all these parts, their blood-vessels dilate, and the conse- quences of a greater amount of blood become manifest—increase of tears, photophobia, etc. The two kinds of effects produced by the nervous system on nutrition and secretion, may co-cxist, or follow each other; and we have in- stances of such a combination or alternation in cases of neuralgia, of worms, etc. ^V^latsoever physical explanation may be adop- ted for the many interesting facts concerning the sympathy existing between remote parts of the u»

287 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. Let me briefly remind you of the conclusions at which we have akeady arrived concerning the decussation in the cerebro-spinal centres of the conductors of sensation and of motive power. This rudely executed diagram, which I have copied from Brown-S^quardâ€™s work, will I think very much simplify your comprehension of the matter. Let us suppose that we have here represented the medulla oblongata and spinal cord, and that we are looking at these parts from behind, so that r is the right and I the left side; let us fancy that the transverse lines at 1, 2, and 3, indicate three points at which lesions exist: 1, being a lesion w^hich engages one half of the me- dulla oblongata above the decussation of the an- terior pyramids ; 2, being just at this decussation, while 3 may represent a lesion anywhere along the cord (say in the lower part of the dorsal re- gion), and engaging one lateral half of it, as in the rabbit, which was made the subject of expe- riment during my last lecture. If a r and p r represent the anterior (motor) and the posterior (sensitive) nerve-roots, and the dotted lines their continuations to the sensorium commune, then we see that a lesion, such as 1 is supposed to indi- cate, must be accompanied by paralysis of both

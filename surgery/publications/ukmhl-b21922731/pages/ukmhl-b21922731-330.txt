LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 312 nemius muscle of a frog, with a long portion of its nerve still attached to it. I next lay this muscle on the pads, so as to include it in the circuit of the galvanometer; but I take care to lay the nerve on this piece of glass, quite out of the circuit, in such a position that I can easily pass through it a rapid succession of shocks from this induction coil, and so strongly tetanizc the muscle. Before I touch the nerve with the wires from the induction coil, you see that the mus- cular current causes the needle to stand at 8°; now I touch the neiwe, and consequently tetanize the muscle; you see the needle comes to 0, and even swings across on the other side. This, gen- tlemen, is one of Du Bois Reymond’s most beau- tiful experiments, and it proves the very impor- tant fact that the muscular current is weakened during contraction. Bearing in mind the foregoing, we now find ourselves in a predicament to perform and under- stand the ingenious experiment devised by Brown- S^quard, and akeady spoken of in reference to his theory as to the muscular sense. Third Experiment.—I have here fastened the limb of a frog, prepared with the nerve as long as possible, to an upright rod; a weight is at-

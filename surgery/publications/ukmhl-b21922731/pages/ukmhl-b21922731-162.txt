144 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY aud is so universally known, that it is hardly necessary to state it. In brief, upon this theory, the spinal mari-ow is regarded at once as a ner- vous centre enjoying an activity of its own, and as a conductor intended to place the muscles, the surface, and various organs, in connexion with the encephalon; this double function is considered as due to the two kinds of substance which enter into its composition. As a centre, it is a pro- ducer of reflex phenomena, which property is due to the grey matter, a substance supposed to be devoid of the power of conveying either sensa- tive impressions or mandates of the will to muscles; the conducting faculty resides entirely in the white substance of the columns of the cord; the posterior columns are regarded as being destined exclusively for the transmission of sensi- tive impressions to the encephalon, while, on the contrary, the anterior and lateral columns are the sole channels through which the influence of the will is conveyed to the muscles. In other words, the posterior columns aud tlieiiâ€™ corresponding neiwe roots are regarded as centripetal conduct- ors; the anterior and lateral columns, with the anterior nerve roots, as centrifugal conductors, while the grey matter is the dynamical, or force-

AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD, 189 But to pass from the realms of hypothesis, it appears tolerably ceitain that the s}’mpathetic ucrve is, first, essentmlly though not exclusively, explain the mechanism of the vaso-dilator nerves. These are examined by Vulpian, and are shown to be, for the most part quite inadequate. “ He rejects the theory of active dilatation of the vessels as in- con-sistent with our knowledge of the structure of their walls : he shows that the arterial distension cannot be due to obstruction caused by contraction of the veins, because these vessels are also dilated, and the quantity of the blood and the rapidity of its flow in them, as well as in the arteries, are increased. He con- siders, at some length, the view of Dr. Browu-S»iquard, who sup- poses that the irritation of the nerves acta, not on the vessels, but on the tissues, and increases their attraction for the blood, whicli accumulates in them in greater quantity, being drawn on hy A vis d fronte. lie formerly looked on this theory as the most plausible, and thought that it derived strong support from his own experiments on the vascular area of the embryo, and from those of Weber on the vessels of amputated limbs; but now he thinks that the results of these ex])erimeut8 may be otherwise explained, and he urges that if the increased vascularity was caused by an attraction between the blood and the tissues, the pressure in the veins should diminish, whereas it is always in- creased during irritation of the nerves. He also notices the very important fact that when at the same time a manifest action is exerted on the tissues and on the vessels by the irritation of the same nerve, these two actions can be separated one from the other. Thus, irritation of the corda tympani causes vascular dilatation in the submaxillar}’ gland and increased flow of saliva. Bernard notices that these two eflfects were not accurately coinci- dent in time, and Heidenhain has discoveied that in an animal poisoned with atropine, the dilatation of the vessels is the only consequence of the irritation, there being no increase in the flow of saliva.

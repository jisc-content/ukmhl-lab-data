182 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY Muller, (lid so much to develop subsequently. But even the facts accumulated by the latter ob- servers hung together but loosely, until their con- nexion and value were indicated by the more recent researches of Claude Bernard, Brown- S^cpiard, and others. Professor Claude Bernard published the results of his first researches on the effects of division of the cervical sympathetic nerve, in 1851 and the l)eginning of 1852, The great fact announced in these publications was, that this section was con- stantly followed by a considerable affiux of blood to the parts of the head supplied by the sympa- thetic. Along with the greater afflux of blood and accompanying dilatation of the blood-vessels, the temperature becomes elevated, hypermsthesia is noticed, and the vital properties of the parts generally become increased. Dr. Brown-Sdquard, with Dr. Tholozan, had before this performed an experiment which, taken in connexion with the preceding, prepared the way for what was to be expected from gal- vanization of the cervical sympathetic, after sec- tion of it had first given rise to the above phenomena. The experiment alluded to is one of prime and fundamental importance, and was

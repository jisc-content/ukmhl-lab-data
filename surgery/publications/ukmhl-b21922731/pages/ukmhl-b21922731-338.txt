320* LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY. object in my present lectures, as much as possible, to bring before you facts in phyaiolog}^ which you can judge of -as well as I can. These facts, inasmuch as they have been experimentally demonstrated, will not, I am confident, readily pass from your memories; and on a'future occa- sion I shall look forward to speaking of some affections of the nervous system, for the proper diagnosis and rational treatment of which sound physiological knowledge is so essential.

253 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. wires in contact with the nerves of the hind limbs, you observe the muscles are violently tetanized, and a peculiar thrUl is communicated to the hand, the result of the rapid contractions produced by the quick succession of shocks. You also see that when 1 pass the currents in different directions through the animalâ€™s body, no controlling in- fluence is exercised over the rapid action of tlie heart, as when 1 bring the wires in contact with the pneumogastric nerves. Uur experiments to-day, have occupied so much time that 1 shall defer until my next lecture an account of some further experiments, the nature of which prevents me from being able to exhibit them to so L'lrge a class. 1 shall now conclude by stating the explanation given of the last exj^er- iment by Dr. Brown-Sdquard. The stopping of the hciut, he says, depends upon the absence of excitation. The cause exciting the heart to Ixjat, he supposes to be the blood contained in the mi- nute blood-vessels of this organ; and he conceives that galvanization of the par vagum produces a complete constriction of the capillary vessels of the heart; the excitation, then, caimot take place on account of the expulsion of the blood from the capillaries.

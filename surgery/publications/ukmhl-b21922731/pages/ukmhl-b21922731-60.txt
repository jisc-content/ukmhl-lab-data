All this tends to perpetuate, as far as nomenclature can, the old notion that syphilis of itself always gets worse, and never gets better spontaneously, liicord’s division is anatornico-chronological. He takes into account not only the time at which certain symptoms appear, but likewise considerations furifished by the state and phy- siological relation of the local aifections.

Bacrensprung of Berlin looks at the question in an anatomico-patholo- gical point of view. He admits syphilis to have a jieriod of hypermmia and a period of tubercle. Secondary syphilis, according to him, manifests itself by inflammations limited to the superfi-

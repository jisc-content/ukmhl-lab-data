220 A NEW THEORY OF As regards the physiology of sensations of colour, a theory so closely analogous as indeed to ])e identical, with reference to the sense of vision, was put forward by Thomas Young, at the com- mencement of this centur}^ He supposed three sorts of conductors to exist in the optic nerve, each specially charged with the functions of con- ducting a different colour—red, green, and violet. The mixture of these three colours in different proportions gave rise to all the other colours of the spectrum. This hypothesis of Young has, with some modifications as to the colours, found a zealous advocate in the distinguished Professor Helm- holtz. It is not necessary for my purpose to enu- merate all the theories which have been ad- vanced in explanation of the various phenomena to which I have just alluded. Suffice it to say that I have long felt that the ingenious idea of distinct conductors did not exactly meet the case. So long ago as in 1861, in a critique on Dr. Brown-S^quard’s work in which his theory Avas first put forward, I expressed the opinion that we could hardly accept the idea “ that the neiwe fibres employed in the transmission of sensitive

156 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY sixth dorsal to the lower extremity. The tissue of the cord in these parts being cut, was shining, looking like porcelain, hard and difficult to be crushed. The grey matter was also a little harder than normally, but of its usual colour. The an- terior and posterior roots seemed normal. In the space between the third and sixth dorsal verte- brae, the cord was softened, pultaceous, resem- bling a whitish, or rather slightly rose pulp, punctuated in some places. AVlien placed in water, many parts became disintegrated and form- ed a kind of emulsion. This alteration existed only in the white substance. The grey, on the contrary, seemed to have preserved its normal consistence. The microscope showed that the grey matter in both the softened and indurated parts contained nonnal cells and fibres, and nor- mal blood-vessels ; while the white substance in softened region contained but rare fibres, which were altered, containing an oily matter and granulations. There was also a quantity of granulated corpuscles of inflammation, with many capillaries, oily drops, and amorphous matter ; in the indurated white substance there was less alteration, and the fibres were more normal and numerous.

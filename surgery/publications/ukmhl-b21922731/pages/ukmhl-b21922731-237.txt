NERVOUS ACTION. 219 “ I hardly need say,” he adds, “ that the num- ber of functionally distinct ner\’’e fibres is prob- ably much greater than is shown in this table.” Mr. Herl^ert Spencer also states his conviction that the nerves which conduct thermic impres- sions are distinct from those which conduct tactile impressions. The following observ’ations may be made when taking a hot bath: let the water be somewhat above blood heat, from 100* to 104* Fahrenheit. After remaining in the bath for a while, until equaUy heated all over, stand up and rub one portion of the body smartly with a flesh brush until it is red, then pause for a few mo- ments and lie down again in the water. It will then be perceived that to the reddened part the water seems much hotter than it does to any other part. “ This fact,” argues Mr. Spencer, “ yields proof, if there needs any, that the nerves which appreciate temperature are not the nerves of touch. Violent friction must produce a mo- mentary incapacity of the nerv^es of touch, and this incapacity would be shown in a decreased, instead of an increased, appreciation of tempera- ture were they the agents concerned.” As will be seen presently, I will venture to ofter another explanation of this and many kin- dred phenomena.

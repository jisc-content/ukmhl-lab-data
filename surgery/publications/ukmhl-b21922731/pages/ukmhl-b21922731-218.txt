200 CRITICAL ESSAY OX THE PHYSIOLOGY In the first case the secretions are increased; in the second diminished. In the first case, nutri- tion is more active, and there is a tendency to hypertrophy and an augmentation of the vital properties of nerves and muscles; in the second case, nutrition is not active, there is a tendency to atrophy, and a diminution of the vital properties of nerves and muscles. Lastly, in the first case, there is an augmentation of temperature, while in the second there is diminution. There is there- fore the most complete difference between these two nervous influences. *â–  Let us now, he continues, employ the know- ledge of these two modes of action of the nervous system, to explain what occurs in some cases of secretory or nutritive reflex phenomena. Suppose, for instance, a calculus in one of the ureters: it irritates the centripetal nerve-fibres of this canal; the irritation is transmitted to the spinal cord, which reflects it upon the muscular coat of the blood-vessels of the two kidneys, and produces a contraction, in consequence of which there is much less blood passing through these organs, so that the urinary secretion is stopped, or much diminished. Suppose a worm in the bowels irrita- ting their centripetal nerve-fibres: the irritation

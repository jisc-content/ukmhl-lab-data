AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 195 plete constriction of the arteries of the webs. Division of the same roots, on the other hand, wa.s followed by full dilatation of the vessels. From this experiment it appears that the vaso- motor nerve-fibres pass along with the motor nerve-roots. For a considerable time past physiologists have been familiar with the influence of reflex actions on .secretion and nutrition. Since the publica- tion of Muller’s Mamuil of Physiology, Stilling’s Treatise on Spinal Irritation, and Henl(^’s various works, no treatise on physiology, or general patholog}', has appeared which has not fully re- cognised the reflex phenomena of nutrition and secretion, as something well known. This makes it the more surprising, that, shortly l>efore his death. Dr. Marshall Hall announced, as a new discovery, the suppo.sed existence of an excito- secretorj' and secretory nerv'e system. Dr. Campbell, of Georgia, U. S., claimed priority of this discovery, which Marshall Hall in a great measure conceded to him : but the truth is that neither one nor the other adduced one single fact to .show the existence of any such distinct .system of uervTs. Admitting the vast importance of the influence exercised over secretion and nutrition

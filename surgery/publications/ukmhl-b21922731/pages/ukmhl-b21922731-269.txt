APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 251 for me the duty of maiiitaiiiing artificial respira- tion, and Dr. Bennett will afterwards be good enough to count the beatings of the heart; but you shall all quite plainly witness the result. Third experiment.â€”The animal (a large and vigorous rabbit) is first killed by poisoning with prussic acid. 1 now fasten in the trachea a portion of a catheter having a vulcanized India-rubber tulie attached, through which artificial respiration will be kept up. Next, 1 carefully raise both pneumogastric nerves upon this little rod of glass ; but as yet 1 do not divide them. Now, upon opening the thorax, the heart is seen pulsating very vigorously, but you will immediately see that it acts even more rapidly when 1 divide the two pneumogastrics, as 1 now do at one cut of the scis- sors. In fact, it now goes too rapidly to be count- ed. I next tie a ligature of silk on that extrem- ity of each pneumogastric which is in connexion with the heart, and by this contrivance of having a little weight at the other end of the silk thread, which 1 hang upon this stand, I gently raise up from the other parts of the neck, about half an inch of each nerve. Everything is now ready for me to apply to the nerves the wires from my induction coil. You see, before I pass the shocks,

LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 238 plished and intelligent surgeons that this country has ever produced, refused to accept the discov- eries of Sir Charles Bell, concerning the roots of the spinal nerves, until Muller and Magcndie placed them beyond doubt by experiment. Many a skilful practitioner now makes an accurate and correct diagnosis in heart disease, who is little conversant with the history of the experiments which have led to the knowledge of the causes of the heart-sounds. INIany a surgeon dexterously applies a ligature on a bleeding vessel, forgetful that were it not for experiments on the arteries of animals, he might still be using the red-hot iron to staunch the blood. In these later times, perhaps experiments on the spinal cord—on the transplantation of peri- osteal and other membranes—on the sympathetic nerve—on the influence of the nervous system over the blood-vessels, are among the physiologi- cal researches which are most calculated to alter and improve practice. Yet many may ask what absolute good has arisen from discoveries of this kind ? To this it must be answered—that it is not possible to know how much good may, and does arise from any newly discovered fact. The scientific inquirer must be led on by the sure and

281 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. tion, he has undertaken some experiments of extreme delicacy. On dividing the anterior columns of the cord alone, he has not found any marked alteration of sensibility ; division of the lateral columns in the dorsiil regions he has found not to diminish but to exalt sensibility in the posterior limbs ; but when the entire cord is divided, except one lateral column, sensitive im- pressions are no longer transmitted. I will admit that there is great difficulty in feeling quite satisfied as to deductions drawn from experiments necessarily of so delicate a nature; when we come, however, to compare them .with the pathology of cases presently to be referred to, we find strong evidence in favour of the \-iew that sensitive impre.ssions in the spinal cord pass chiefly along the grey substance. The proposition next for consideration, viz., that the conductors of sensitive impressions from the va- rious parts of the body decussate in the spinal cord and not in the encephalon, as hitherto generally supposed, constitutes not only one of the most brilliant, but one of the most clearly proved of the discoveries of Dr. Brown-S(5quard.

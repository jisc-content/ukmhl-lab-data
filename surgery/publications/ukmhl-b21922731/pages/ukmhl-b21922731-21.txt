Of gonorrhoea I speak merely to say that the opinion of Hunter, tis to the identity Gonorrba?a, , i • i i ot gonorrhoea with otlier venereal diseases, is now I believe universally aban- doned. Even before his time, in 1767, Balfour maintained that gonorrhma and syphilis were distinct maladies, and this view was afterwards advocated by Ellis, Duncan, Bell, and Bosquillon. It remained, liowever, for Hernandez, Cock- burn, M’Gregor, Hennen, and Guthrie to estab- lish this proposition, which has been verified, and, in short, clearly demonstrated as a fact, by the experiments of Ricord and Rollet.

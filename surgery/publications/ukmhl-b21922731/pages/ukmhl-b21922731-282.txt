264 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY No doubt, the increased afflux of blood to a part, which results from paralysis of the sympa- thetic (as you have seen in the rabbit’s ear), is followed by a more active nutrition of that part; but I cannot agree with Dr. Brown- S^quard, that this active nutrition “ produces an increase in the normal suction 'power of the capil- laries,” and is “a cause of attraction of arterial blood.” The term “attraction” appears to me to be here inadmissible; the increased chemical changes of secretion and nutrition are at first the effect, and afterwards the cause of a greater accumula- tion of blood in the part; but this augmentation of the amount of blood, depending as it does mainly on the paralysis of the vessels, is of too passive a character to be attributed to attraction in the ordinary sense of this term, while suction power almost implies the active dilatation to which I have already objected. I am not aware that any one single instance of an organic attrac- tion between minute parts has been actually observed. Mliller, in his investigations, failed to perceive any ; yet it is certain that the tissues and the glands have the power of drawing from the blood the material for their nutriment and for their secretions. But it must be remembered

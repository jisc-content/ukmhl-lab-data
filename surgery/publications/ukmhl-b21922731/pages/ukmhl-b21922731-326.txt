LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 308 unaccompanied by pain; but if the muscular con- traction be very violent, or if the centripetal nerve of muscle be in a hypersesthetic condition, pain results, and hence the accompanying spasm and cramp. In support of this view, Brown- S^quard gives the following experiment:— “ If we fix a thread to the tendon of a muscle of a frog, and attach to this thread a weight, ca- pable of entirely preventing the contraction of the muscle, which is fixed by its other extremity, we find that every time the muscle tends to con- tract, there is an excitation of the nerve lying upon it, and a contraction of the muscle to which this nerve is distributed. Hence it is not neces- sary for the muscle to contract in order to produce in nerves in contact with it a galvanic excita- tion. I repeat that it is sufficient that they tend to contract. Now I have found that the greater the resistance to the contraction of the muscle, the greater is the galvanic excitation that it gives to nerves in contact with its tissue. On the con- trary, if there is no resistance at all, as abeady shown by Professor Matteucci, after the section of the tendon, then the galvanic excitation of the nerve in contact with the contracting muscle no longer exists.”

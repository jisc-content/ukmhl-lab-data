282 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY lateral half of the spinal cord. From the result produced, I have no doubt that the division has been made with tolerable precision. The right lateral half of the cord has been divided, and you perceive the following symp- toms :â€” Left hind limb (uninjured side). Colder than its fellow. Almost insensible. Not paralyzed of move- ment. Right hind limb (side of lesion). Hotter than its fellow. Very sensitive. Paralyzed of movement. In this other guinea-pig upon which I have about three weeks ago made a similar division of a lateral half of the spinal cord, you see that recovery has, in a great degree, taken place. The animal is becoming subject to fits of an epileptic character, as a result of this injury; but I shall, at a subsecpient period, when the epileptiform affection has become more developed, direct yoirr attention to this subject. At present let us con- fine ourselves to the facts, that when half the spinal cord is cut across on either side, the hind les on the side of the section, far from becoming insensible, feels acutely; the opposite side losing all sensibility.

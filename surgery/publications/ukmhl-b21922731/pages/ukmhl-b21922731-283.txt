APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 265 that this sort of attraction, if it be so named, is something quite difierent from what Prochaska speaks of, when writing of the action of the nerves on the vessels. The conjecture of this eminent physiologist was, that the “ I'is nervosa, increased by a stimulus, renders the force of attraction of the fluids circulating through the vessels greater; so that by this means the fluids ■ are attracted from every side t<^ the centre of stimulation—as occurs, for example, when seal- ing wax is gently rubbed on a piece of cloth, and made electrical, and attracts sand and various particles.” Perhaps it would l:)e wise for me not to object to a term which has been so generally used by the most thoughtful physiologists, yet I must say that in the present state of knowledge, the phrase, attraction of blood by the tissues, gives a wrong impression of that vital aflinity of which we have evidence in the mutual but unex- plained relation existing between the blood and its vessels, and their surrounding tissues. However divergent and various may be the theoretic views arising from the facts which I have detailed, and the experiments which you have witnessed, no one can doulit that recent researches on the vaso-motor nerve-trunks, as 18*

Admitting that the value of the result to be obtained must be very variously estimated by different individuals, it is obvious why, as a gene- ral rule, medical men have not hesitated in pro- nouncing vivisection justifiable. Being familiar with the evils, they can appreciate the efforts— very often fruitless, but none the less meritorious —of physiologists to throw light on the obscure phenomena of disease, by experiments on animals.

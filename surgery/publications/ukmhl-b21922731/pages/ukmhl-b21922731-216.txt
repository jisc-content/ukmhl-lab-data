198 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY heat is felt, when exposed to a cold wind in winter. No one is ignorant how much the stimulus of sinapisms and blisters causes deriva- tion to the stimulated part; an acrid smoke, or fine powder, getting into the eyes excites a copious flow of tears, and the veasels of the con- junctiva, previously invisible, become distended with blood. The smoke of tobacco or any other acrid aroma, retained in the mouth, excites a copious flow of saliva, etc. But the same thing happens when the nerves are excited not directhf but indire^thf through the brain. We know that the face is suffused with the blush of modesty ; grief causes a copious flow of tears, congestion of the vessels of the conjunctiva, and redness and swelling of the whole face. The sight of agree- able food provokes the flow of saliva; it is not unusual for some persons to vomit, or be purged, liy only seeing a medicine, etc. Does not the vis nervosa, increased by a stimulus, render the force of attraction of the fluids circulating through the vessels greater, so that by this means the fluids are attracted from every side to the centre of stimulation, as occurs, for example, wdien sealing ■wax is gently rubbed on a piece of cloth, and made electrical, and attracts sand and particles of various kinds 1 ”

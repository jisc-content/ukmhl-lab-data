It is to be regretted that Dr. Drown-Sequard has not, in these lectures, given more fully all his reasons for adopting this view. The kinds of sensitive impressions which he Ijelieves to be furnished with distinct and separate conducting fibres, are the sensations of touch, tickling, pain, heat, cold, and the peculiar sensation which accompanies muscular contrac- tion.* It is obvious that in seeking to interrogate nature uj>on points so delicate and refined as these, experimentation upon the lower animals can give no satisfactory answer; pathological cases scrutinized with tnithfulness and care, can alone yield accurate information upon these topics. Hence it is that Dr. Brown-Sequard, with an ear- nest desire to obtain light from every source, with * Compare “ Theory of Nervous Action,” p. 217,

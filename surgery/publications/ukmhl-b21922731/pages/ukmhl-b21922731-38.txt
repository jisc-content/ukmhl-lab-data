LECTURES ON VENEREAL DISEASES. 24 closely with these, so much so that those which he accounts as having an incubation period of six weeks, or that of Alfred Fournier of 70 days, must be considered exceptional. Indeed even the case related by Bumstead, in which, under great anxiety, and the close ob- servation which probably Avas the consecpience of tliis, thirty-five clear days elapsed before any sore Avas noticed, must also be regarded as an unusually long incubation. Let us, however, compare the results of these cases Avith the results of direct experiment by inoculation of liealtliy subjects. In cases where inoculation Avith syphilitic matter has been experimentally performed (I refer to the cases of Wallace, Vidal, Necker, and others), the period elapsing from the day of actual inoculation up to that onAvhich a chancre Avas found to make its appearance, varied from 18 to 35 days, giving a mean of 27 days. In cases of inoculation directly from infecting chancres, Nollet’s case gives 18 days ; Baeren- sprung’s, 28 days ;-tind Lindwurm’s, 23 days. These cases are of course the most important of all as regards absolute precision. Being

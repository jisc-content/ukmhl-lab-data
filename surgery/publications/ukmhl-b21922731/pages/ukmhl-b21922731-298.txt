LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 280 impressions in the spinal cord takes place chiefly in its central part, i.e. in the grey matter, and second, that the conductors of sensitive impres- sions from the various parts of the body decussate in the spinal cord and not in the encephalon, as hitherto generally supposed. For the first, I must be content to show tlie spinal cords (now hardened in spirit) of animals previously made the subject of experiment, and in which the symptoms consequent upon the lesion were noted during life; of the second, I think I may promise to show you what you will all admit to be strong experimental proof. Here is the spinal cord of a rabbit, in which, as you see, the posterior columns have been transversely divided with the greatest possible precision, and what was the result ? Far from being followed by any loss of feeling, the lesion was accompanied by the very reverse effect. So far as the posterior columns are concerned, this single experiment annihilates the theory of Longet. “ If,” says Dr. Brown-S^quard, “ the transmis- sion of sensitive impressions does not take place along the posterior columns, it remains to be found what is the channel of tlieii’ transmission'{ ” In attempting to give an answer to this ques-

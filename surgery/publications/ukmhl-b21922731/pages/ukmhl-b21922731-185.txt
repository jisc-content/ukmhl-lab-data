AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 167 and all the longitudinal elements of this centre would be left uninjured; but it is impossible not to cut more or less on either side. However, when the operation luis succeeded, i.e., when the two lateral halves have been very little in- jured, a striking result is obtiiined: voluntary movements still exist in the hind limbs, but sen- sibility is entirely lost in them. The animal has the use of his two hind limbs; he moves about pretty freely. The loss of sensibility, therefore, must depend on the division of the commiasures of the spinal cord, or in other words, on the elements of this organ which cross each other in the median line, or rather, in the median plane. If, on comparing the results of these three experiments, and if, after considering the many great difficulties already spoken of, which attend all such experiments, the reader admits (as 1 myself assuredly do) that the results may be accepted, then the inferences from them are clear and undeniable ; so that it is unnecessary here to point out how completely the third experiment disproves the notion of some German physiolo- gists, that the grey matter has the power of transmitting impressions in every direction.

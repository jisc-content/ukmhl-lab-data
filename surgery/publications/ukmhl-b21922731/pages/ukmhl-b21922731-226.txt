There was not the least redness on this spot, nor any sensation or effect produced by passing my finger over its surface; but on com- pressing it with my finger and thumb against the nail very cautiously, a slight convulsion instantly ensued. I asked the patient if anjThing pricked him 1 He said “No, but something made him feel very odd."

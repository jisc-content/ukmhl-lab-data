285 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. bar region, and a careful dmsion of the entire extent of the part of the organ giving origin to the nerves of the posterior limbs, is made directly along the middle line, so as to separate the two lateral halves of the organ one from the other. If this experiment could be executed perfectly, nothing would be di\ ided in the cord except the commissures which unite the right and left sides, and all the longitudinal elements of this centre would be left uninjured; but it is impossible not to cut more or less on either side. However, when the operation has succeeded well, i.e., when the two lateral halves have been very little injured, a striking result is obtained. Voluntarj' move- ment still exists in the hind limbs, but sensibility is entirely lost in them. The animal has the use of his two hind limbs ; he moves about pretty freely. The loss of sensibility, therefore, must depend on the division of the commissures of the spinal cord, or in other wâ€™ords, on the elements of this organ which cross each other in the median line, or rather in the median place. If we compare the results of these experiments, and after considering the many great difficulties ali-eady spoken of, which attend all such experi- ments, we nevertheless conceive (as I myself as-

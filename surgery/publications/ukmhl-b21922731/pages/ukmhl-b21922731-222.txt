204 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY shown the influence of these nerves directly on the vessels of the pia mater; and the experiments of Kussmaiil and Tenner, although coming from a different direction, are strongly confirmatory of Brown-Secpiard’s views, and seem to those able experimenters to justify them in asserting “ that epileptic convulsions can be brought about by contraction of the blood-vessels induced by the Viiso-motor nerves.” A great number of observers have of late added new facts to the physiology of the vaso-motor nervous system. But can we regard the characteristic phenomena of epilepsy, or the still more subtle forms of disease met with in insanity, vertigo, hallucinations, etc., as entii’cly explicable by any such physical changes 1 Must we not, at least, still recognise the humoral views of Todd, and such notions as have been put forward by the original and ingenious Dr. C. B. Eadcliffe, as having their element of truth as a “ vera causa ” in some cases '? When we see a large snake struck; across the tail with a rod, and instantly, in the twinkling of an eye, seized vdth a paralysis as complete as death, which yet, after a time, passes off again, can we attribute such a condition to the constriction of the blood-vessels of the cerebro-spinal axisI think not; be-

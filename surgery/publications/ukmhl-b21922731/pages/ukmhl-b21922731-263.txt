245 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. The ordinary loss amounts, after some minutes, to from 6° to 8® F. In one case he observed a loss of only 2°, and in another there occurred no loss at all—on the contrar}^ an increase of tem- perature amounting to 1°*4 F. The general conclusion is, that in these experi- ments the temperature of the body does not change sensibly, while a sympathetic contraction of the blood-vessels in a distant part is usually at- tended with a considerable loss of temperature in that part. The cooling of my left hand cannot have depended upon the arrival in it of colder blood, for my mouth remained as before. We must infer, therefore, that the cooling depended on a less supply of blood, the blood-vessels having contracted in sympathy with the other limb. In his well known article on animal heat, in Todd's Cyclopmlia of A natomy and Physiology, W. F. Edwards observes concerning this experi- ment :—“ When one hand was plunged in water cooled down by ice, the other, which was not subjected to the action of the cold bath, lost nearly five degrees (R.) in temperature. “ It is therefore apparent,” he continues, “first, that partial chills, or the exposure of individual parts to low temperatures, may be, and are, felt

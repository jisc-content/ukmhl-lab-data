Wheu we see all this, is it not hard to resist the conclusion that, whether arising originally from a common source or not, we have now to do with two distinct morbid principlesâ€”that small pox does not differ more from measles, the dog from the wolf, than the simple vene- real sore does from the syphilitic ? You must remember, however, that there are many distinguished authorities, and we may especially mention Melchior Robert, and Lang- lebert, who teach the doctrine of the unity of the chancrous poison ; they hold that the virus, the seed, is one and the same in all chancres ; that the conditions of the soil make the difference. Their doctrine is, that if the seed falls on uncon- genial soil, if the virus affects an individual whose peculiarity of constitution, state of health, or other circumstances render him inapt for its development, it germinates and springs up but to be blighted after a few weeks ; it produces a local sore, perhaps a suppurating bubo, nothing more. But if it falls on a soil tit for its recep- tion, it strikes root in the syphilitic sore, and flourishes, in due time to bear flower and fruit in the secondary and tertiary consequences.

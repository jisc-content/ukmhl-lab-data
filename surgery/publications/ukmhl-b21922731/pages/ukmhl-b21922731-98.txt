84 LECTUIIES ON VENEREAL DISEASES. If a syphilitic patient smokes and drinks beer lialf the day, and plays cards and drinks punch half the night, or if, like our patient Michael B , the cab-driver, he is exposed night after night to wet and cold, and at the same time submitted to whiskey-punch treatment, his case will become aggravated—his disease will pass from the mild to the severe form.

Let his blood be on his own head.

AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 187 meutal physiologists in Europe, it would hardly call for even a passing mention. Professor Ber- nard has imagined, that the dilatation of the blood-vessels in many of the circumstiinces influ- encing secretion, etc., is an active phenomenon ; he fancies, in fact, that the capillaries have two properties—contraction and dilatation; and, if we understiind him aright, he conceives the latter to l>e no less an active phenomenon than the fonner, each being put into play by a distinct set of neiwes. Un the other hand, to stiy that the blootl- vessels dilate in consequence of a greater attrac- tion for arterial blood developed in the tissues of the part, conveys to our mind no distinct mean- ing, but-is merely putting into other, and less simple, temis the expression of what takes place when the small arteries are olisen’ed to become dilated. The view advocated by Pfliiger {Ueber da^n llemmumjs Nerren-snstem), must be admit- ted as exceedingly ingenious, and as giving a ver)' adroit explanation of many of the pheno- mena in question; but we cannot but agree with i\Ir. Joseph Lister, that the supposition that there is a certain set of nerve-fibres, the so-called inhibitory system of nerves [Hemmumjs Nei'ven- system), whose sole function is to arrest, or keep

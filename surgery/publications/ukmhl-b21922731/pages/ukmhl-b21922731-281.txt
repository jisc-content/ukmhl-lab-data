It would seem, indeed, as if the twig of the lingual suspended contraction, and produced dilatation of the vessel, in the same way as that in which the vagus has been seen to banish the state of systolic contrac- tion, and leave the heart in the state of diastolic dilatation, or in which, in Pfiuger’s experiment, the spiud cord or grand sympathetic may banish contraction, and leave the intestine in the state of dilatation.’*

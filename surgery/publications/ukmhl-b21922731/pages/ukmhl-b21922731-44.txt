Rollet of Lyons and his school explain by the theory of the “ mixed chancre ” several phenomena otherwise out of the usual order, as we may say. Thus a chancre, to all appear- ance a simple sore, is followed by constitu- tional symptoms. Ah ! they say, it was a mixed chancre ; in tlie initial stage the disease had the character of the simple sore. A chancre, apparently altogether syphilitic, with hard base, is re-inoculated on the bearer, as may occur four or five times in one hundred. They say it was a mixed chancre. The purely syphilitic part is not re-inoculable, but of course the virus of the simple chancre is. And also suppurating bubo following a chancre, which is to all appearance a true syphilitic sore, is explained on the “ mixed theory.” We must be slow to admit such an hypothe- sis without well observed facts to support it;

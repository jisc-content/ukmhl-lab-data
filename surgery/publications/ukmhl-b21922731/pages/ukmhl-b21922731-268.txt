250 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY on a great many various experiments made by Dr, Augustus Waller, Bonders and several of bis pupils, Kussmaul and Tenner, Moritz ScbifF, and myself, showing that all circumstances, whatever they may be, which cause an increase in the quantity of blood passing in the blood-vessels of the head in a given time, produce there almost, if not all, the phenomena follo'wing the section of the cervical sympathetic." Let me now direct your attention to another experiment, viz,, that which shows how the action of the heart is controlled and even arrested by passing along the pneumogastric nerves induced galvanic currents. Claude Bernard had already ascertained that the sounds of the heart were not to be heard in a dog during galvanization of the vagi by induced currents, but it is to the brothers Ernest and Henri Weber* that the merit is due of having first clearly enunciated the fact that the action of the heart is arrested under these circum- stances. It is one of the fundamental experi- ments connected with the subject of which I now treat, and I earnestly beg your closest attention to the precise circumstances under which it is performed. I shall ask Dr. Cruise to undertake * Handworterbuch der Physiologic, Art. Muskelbewegung, 1846.

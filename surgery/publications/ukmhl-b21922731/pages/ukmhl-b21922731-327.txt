309 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. In this manner Brown-S^quard attempts to explain, ’«dth what, as I have already said, appears to me singular ingenuity, the pain accompanying contracted muscles, cramps, spasms, contraction of the uterus, etc. Let me now show to you the experiments which seem to justify these conclusions, and which I have slightly modified in order to make them more visible to all. But, before doing so, let me offer a few obser\'ations on the subject of animal electricity—a subject which, thanks to the in- dustry of Professor Matteucci, of Pisa, and to the genius of Du Bois Reymond, of Berlin, has be- come one, not only of great interest, but vast practical importance. The history of animal electricity presents three distinct lines of research —first, that of special organs for the discharge of electricity known to exist in certain fish, com- menced by Walsh in 1772, and since followed with success by Dr. John Da\’y, Professor Fara- day, and others; second, that concerning the electrical properties of muscle and ner\’e, starting from the fundamental experiment of Galvani, in 178G, followed, or at least not lost sight of, by Humboldt, and, in these latter times, investigated with great care by Matteucci, Du Bois Reymond,

110 LECTUllES ON VENEREAL DISEASES. some mercurial applications are only local in their action. These actions of ditferent mer- curials, or of mercurials used in ditferent me- thods, must be carefully discriminated from each other. To one of them only can ve assign any of that influence which has been called, .and is still regarded by many as specific. I have stated in a former lecture, that I have never known anything like constitutional mer- curial action from the use of calomel ointment; yet this is a very useful ointment in many skin affections â€” syphilitic and other ; its action seems to be local. Citrine ointment may also be used, more or less diluted, and rubbed ex- tensively over the body. I think it is of real service in clearing away various eruptions, but I have never known it produce any affection of the gums. The ointment of the red iodide of mercury, so useful in lupoid ulcerations, also appears to have only a local action. Extensive condylomata, l)y cleanliness and dusting the surface with powdered calomel, are quickly cured ; yet here also there seems to be nothing more than a local effect. Possibly the sublimed calomel of the calomel vapour-bath.

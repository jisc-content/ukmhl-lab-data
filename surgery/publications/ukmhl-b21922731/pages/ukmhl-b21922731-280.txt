LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 262 vigorous pulsations. To assign to the nerves functions so distinct as those of the bridle and the lash, appears to me a very startling innova- tion in physiology ; and although I l)elieve it has been very generally accepted, yet I cannot but think that we shall yet find a simpler expla- nation for the phenomenon in question. Although I am myself unable to get the better of my old prejudices, which make me regard muscular con- traction as an active process, resulting from the stimulation conveyed to the muscular fibre through the nerves, yet I freely confess that the notions of Dr. C. B. Eadcliffe, with regard to muscular action, have been shown to be in har- mony with many known facts. According to his view, it appears that there is a state of polarity in living muscle during re- laxation which produces relaxation, and that con- traction is nothing more than the necessary result of the muscle being liberated from this state, and • left to the operation of the attractive force which is inherent in the physical constitution of the muscular molecules. In speaking of the action of the lingual nerve in Bernard’s experiment upon the sub-maxillary gland, Dr. Eadcliffe supposes that the twig of the lingual acts upon the coats

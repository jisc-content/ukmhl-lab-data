164 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY decussation for sensitive impressions, the subject of careful experiment, and some of them came very near to making the discovery, whose accom- plishment was, however, reserv^ed for Dr. Brown- S^quard, and which is not only one of the most conclusive of his demonstrations, but is an addi- tion to science of great practical importance. Istly. The spinal cord of a mammal is laid bare at the level of the two or three last dorsal verte- brae, and a lateral half of this organ (including the posterior, the lateral, and the anterior col- umns, and all the grey matter on one side) is di- vided. (See diagrammatic figure, 3.) The animal is left at rest a little while, and then it is ascer- tained that sensibility seems to be much increased in the posterior limb on the side of the section, while it seems to be lost, or extremely diminished, in the posterior limb on the opposite side. There seems to be, therefore, hypermsthesia behind and on the same side as a transverse section of a complete lateral half of the spinal cord, while, on the contrary, there seems to be ancesthesia behind and on the opposite side to the section. With re- ference to motion it is the reverse; power of move- ment is lost on the side of the section, but per- sists on the uninjured side: see the diagrammatic

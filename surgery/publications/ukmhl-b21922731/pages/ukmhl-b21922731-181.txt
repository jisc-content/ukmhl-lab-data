AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 163 tion of the anterior pyramids. Sir Charles Bell was so fond of making systematic plans for him- self, that he seems to have been thus led to adopt, on very insufficient grounds, an idea which suifed his imaginar}^ scheme. He found good anatomi- cal reasons and pathological facts to support the belief that the voluntary motor fibres of the trunk and limbs make their decussation at the lower part of the medulla oblongata, and that the ante- rior p}Tamids are, for the most part, formed by these conductors after their decussation. He could not have given his assent to the view of Foville and Valentin, that there are in the me- dulla oblongata, two sets of motor columnsâ€”one the anterior pyramids, the other the olivary col- umns, the fibres of which last they conceived to decussate all along the pons Varolii. Sir Charles wished to balance the notion of the decussation of the motor fibres in the crossing of the anterior pyramids (for which idea he had good foundation), by the idea of a similar decuasation of the sen- sitive fibres at a somewhat corresponding point posteriorly (for which he had no foundation at all). ^lany physiologists, feeling dissatisfied with a baseless, purely speculative theoiy% made this important question of the precise place of

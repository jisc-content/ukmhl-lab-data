AXD PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 199 Modern physiology will hardly be content to answer this question in the aflBrmative; to me it would seem as unsatisfactoiy’ as the sup- position of active dilatation of the blood-vessels. Although to my mind the solution given to the question, how a reflex action may produce or stop a secretion, how it may produce an atrophy or an hypertrophy, an inflammation or some other change in nutrition, by Dr. Brown-Sequard, is in some respects not more satisfactorj’- than that ofiered by Prochaska, yet it must be admitted that he puts forward his view very forcibly. There are, he argues, two modes of action of the nerv'ous system in the production of the phenomena of nutrition and secretion. By one of these actions, the nervous system determines an increase in the attraction of bloo<l by the livdng tissues, and in this case the phenomena are accompanied by a dilatation of the blood-vessels; while the reverse exists when the nerv'ous system, in.stead of acting upon the of the tissues, acts upon the walls of the blood-vessels, and produces a constriction. In the first case, the quantity of blood passing through the part on which the nervous system has acted, is in- creased; while in the second case it is diminished. 14

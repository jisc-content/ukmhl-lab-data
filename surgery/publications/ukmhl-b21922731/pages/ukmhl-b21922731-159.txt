AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 141 Before entering upon an analysis of the opin- ions of Dr. Brown-S^quard on the physiology of this nervous centre (the spinal cord), it may not he amiss to state what other views have been put forward, and what generally accepted, since Sir Charles Bell propounded that which was adopted as fulhj ascertained by Dr. Henr}", in the report just alluded to. I need not do more than mention in the most cursory way the experi- ments of Fodera, who, on dividing one posterior column of the spinal cord in the cer\dcal region, produced loss of feeling in the opposite side, and loss of movement in the same, and who, on re- peating the same experiment in the lumbar re- gion, obtained results diametrically opposite : or those of Backer, who, on cutting across the pos- terior columns, obseiwed a destruction of both feeling and motion in the posterior limbs: or of Schoeps, who, on re})cating the same experiment, thought that he found sensilulity persisting, and motion destroyed, in the posterior extremities. The ^^ews of Bellingeri, that the anterior columns of the spinal cord are a bundle of nerve fibres animating the fiexor muscles, and that the posterior columns contain the nerve fibres anima- ting the extensor muscles, are more deserving of

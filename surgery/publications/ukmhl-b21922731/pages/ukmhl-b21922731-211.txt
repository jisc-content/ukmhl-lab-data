AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 193 has been experimentally shown in the head of the ral)bit, after section of the cendcal sympa- thetic, and in the lower limb on the same side, after section of a lateral half of the spinal cord, so the constriction or spasm of these vessels has been made obvdous as the result of galvanic and other stimulation. The discovery of Dr. Brown-S^quard as to the contraction of the ves- sels of the ear on galvanization of the cervdcal sympathetic after section, was a prime step in this direction. We regard, likewise, the researches of Mr. Joseph luster,* “ On the parts of the nervous system regulating the contractions of the arteries,” as of gi*eat value, and as having done much to explain the discrepancies upon this sub- ject found between the exj>eriments of Schilf, Wharton Jones, Waller, and others. The con- striction, says Lister, of the arteries of the frog’s webs, on ir-ritiition of the cord, may 1r3 well de- monstrated in the following simple manner. The head of the frog l)eing depressed, so as to stretch the ligament Iwtween the occiput and the first vertebra, a sharp knife is carried across the spinal canal, immediately behind the head, so as * Philosophical Transactions, Part ii. 1858; also On the Early Stuyes of Inflammation, by the same author, iu the same volume.

172 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY distinguisli them at a distance of twelve centi- metres. The nonnal limit for that limb is gener- ally from three to five centimetres. In another case, where anaesthesia was slighter, the limit of the discriminating power was at from nine to six- teen centimetres. In two other cases, in which the diminution of sensibility had not been dis- covered by other means of diagnosis, the compass indicated a very slight and beginning anaesthesia â€”the limit being at from six to seven cen- timetres. Tlicse facts demonstrate that, by the help of a pair of compasses, a physician can with tolerable precision determine: 1st, whether there may be slight anaesthesia or not; 2nd, what is the de- gree of anaesthesia 3rd, what changes occur from day to day in the amount of anaesthesia as regards tactile sensibility. The same is true for cases of hyperaesthesia. In a case of paraplegia of motion, the patient felt the two points of the compasses on his feet, even at the distance of five millimetres, whilst a healthy person feels the two points only when they are at a greater distance than twenty-five millimetres. For success in such experiments, the two points should be blunted and applied simultaneously.

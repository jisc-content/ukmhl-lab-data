194 CIUTICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY to divide the cord from the brain; the toes may now be tied out, and any observation made upon the web, without the inconvenience generally produced by voluntary stmggles on the part of the animal, while at the same time the use of chloroform is avoided, which is desirable, on account of the irritating effect of its vapour on the we]), and the constant care required for its administration. If the webs be examined, im- mediately after the operation, they will be found exsanguine from the extreme constriction of the arteries; but in a few minutes this state will give place to dilatation, with free flow of blood. If now a hue needle, curved at the end, be intro- duced through the wound in the spinal canal, so that its point may penetrate a short distance into the cord, while the eye of the observer is kept over the microscope, the arteries will be seen to become constricted to absolute closure, and to dilate again after withdrawal of the needle. The experiment may be repeated as often as may be desired, until the cord becomes disorganized. Phliger, in operating upon the large edible frog, succeeded in applying the galvanic stimulus to the anterior roots of the sciatic nerve within the spinal canal, with the eflect of producing com-

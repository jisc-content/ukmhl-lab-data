242 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY of you know me well enough to think that I would not willingly cause useless pain to either animal or man; but the surgeon is early taught to look beyond the pain of the moment to the benefit of the future; -and while I heartily concur in the censure of any who may, without sufficient reason, have recourse to vivisection, yet I must express my conviction, that those humane, and, no doubt, very kind-hearted persons, who object altogether to this method of scientific investiga- tion, take a very limited view of the subject. If it was their duty, as it wiU be yours, to witness the convulsive writhings of the epileptic, or to sit by while the mother, who will not trust it in the hands of a stranger, watches her infant as it lies upon her lap, and with a power of observation, by experience rendered painfully acute, perceives the movements of the lips, the twitching of the eye, the pallor and subsequent lividity of the face, the restless motion of the head, and helpless cry that usher in the general convulsion, then, I conceive, such persons would admit that true humanity permits, in order to make a step towards unravelling the vast en- tanglement in which the mysterious phenomena of disease are involved, that animals may be sacrificed.

LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 266 regulating contraction and dilatation of blood- vessels, have thrown a flood of light upon many- obscure questions regarding pathology and dis- ease. Not only have we an explanation of the well-ascertained “ uhi stimulus, ihi jiuxus ’* tlu’ough the vaso-motor nerves, but we find, through the same channel, a physical explanation of sympathetic and reflex actions afiecting remote parts of the body. Nervous influences, similar to those which, acting transiently, “ call to the cheek Tlie hot blush of shame or the coldness of fear,” acting continuously for a longer period, must give lise to hypertrophy or atrophy, according as the vessels are persistently dilated or contracted. You saw how the cold acting on my right hand was followed by a reflex contraction of the blood- vessels of my left, and consequent loss of heat in it. The converse is illustrated by the enlarging uterus of pregnancy, causing the sympathetic turgescence, and, so to speak, hypertrophy of the mammary gland. But the truth is, that in adducing instances of reflex sympathies existing between remote parts, one is hampered by an “ emharras de richesse.” We see examples on every side ; nor is there any

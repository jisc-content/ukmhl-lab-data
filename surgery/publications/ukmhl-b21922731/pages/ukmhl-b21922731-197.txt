AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 179 a structure analogous to the tubular membrane of a nen^e fibre; and in the white structure of the columns, anterior, lateral, and posterior, the structure represented by the white substance of Schwann; while the grey medullary sulistance takes the place of the axis cylinder. Of course this comparison merely seiwes to point out an ideal similitude; nevertheless, as it seems probable that the axis cylinder, encased and insulated as it is by the surroundiug tunics, can be the means of conveying sensations produced by divers means of irritation, so it seems that there is some reason to suppose that the grey matter conveys all sorts of impressions, and even also the orders of the will to muscles. If we divide transversely, in the dorsal region, the whole posterior half of the grey matter and a part of the lateral columns, besides the posterior columns, we find that the voluntary movements are much diminished in the abdominal limbs. If the division l)e carried further, so that the whole of the central grey matter be divided, the animal can hardly move its abdominal limbs, and if we add to this section that of the anterior horns of giâ€™ey matter, the loss of movement seems to l^e- come complete, although the anterior columns

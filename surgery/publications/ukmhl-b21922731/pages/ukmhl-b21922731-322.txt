304 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY which all the parts of one of its hind limbs were amputated except the nerves, and in which the toes are, after a time, about losing their sensibility, in consequence of all circulation of blood being at an end in the limb, there is, nevertheless, a rapid and very notable return of sensibility on dividing the posterior columns of the spinal cord in the dorsal region. It is obvious that this return of sensibility cannot be due to any cause connected with the vessels of the partially amputated limb ; we must attribute it rather to the increased vascu- larity of the spinal cord, which must, more or less extensively, result from the injury done to it. So it would appear that after division of a lateral half of the spinal cord, the increased vascularity which unavoidably attends such an experiment may in some degree account for the hypercesthesia in question. It must, however, be admitted that it is not an easy matter to give an altogether satis- factory explanation of the remarkable increase of sensibility resulting from a division of the lateral half of the spinal cord; yet it seems very reasonable to suppose that any cause producing increase of vascularity of the central or aggregated, or of the peripheral or diffused portions of the nervous tree, may exalt the functionsâ€”on the one hand, of

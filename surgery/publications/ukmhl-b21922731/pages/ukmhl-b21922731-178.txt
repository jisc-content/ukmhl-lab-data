160 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY pared I had not met with them. In both cases, however, the two horns of grey matter were most beautifully injected with blood, as -was evident after the sections were dried and placed under Canada balsam. Hence it would appear that, after administration of stiychnine, great conges- tion and ii’ritation take place in the grey matter, which, in the situations where they are most ful- ly developed, as in the loins, may pass into effu- sion or dilatation of the blood-vessels; and still all this occurs without any sensations—without any pain. Were the gi’ey matter in the spinal cord sensitive, or did the sensitive nerves penetrate into the grey matter, such congestion or irrita- tion, as excites in a sensitive nerve itself the most intense pain, could not be conceived to exist without occasioning some sensation. Hence it follows also that reflex movements cause no pain nor sensation in the spinal cord, so that, by this observation, the direct ascent of the sensitive nerves in the spinal cord—of which I possess the most satisfactory preparations — is physiologically (or pathologically, if we will) confirmed.” Anyone who carefuUy peruses the foregoing passage will perceive in itself, without reference

202 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY liocly, it ^vill be admitted that the subject is one of amazing importance, and, considering its im- portance, it is surprising that so little has been done by physiologists and practitioners to develop its manifold relations, in health as well as in dis- ease. Although more than once regretting that his space does not allow him “ to enter in greater developments” on his subject, Dr. Brown-S^quard deals with it at considerable length, and in some respects treats it with great originality. In speaking of the morbid changes in the nutrition of the brain, of the spinal cord, and of the organs of sense, produced by an irritation of some centripetal nerve, he shows that insanity, epilepsy, chorea, catalepsy, extasis, hydrophobia, hysteric and other varieties of nervous complaints, may be the result of a simple, often slightly felt, irrita- tion of some centripetal nerve. He brings what we conceive to be very ingenious, and at the same time valid, arguments in support of this novel view—that it is occasionally by a reflex action of one part of the cerebro-spinal axis on another part of itself, through the nerves going to the blood-vessels, that irritation of one portion of the neiwous centre acts in modifying or altering the nutrition of another portion of itself.

1 92 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY blood-vessels, increase of heat and sensibility, and of the general vital properties of the parts. Hence it seems to follow that the vaso-motor nerve-fibres follow, in the spinal cord, a course similar to, if not identical with, the fibres for the propagation of commands of the wdl to the mus- cles; so that, referring again to our diagram, a fact, we find some means of accounting for the hypermsthesia on the side of the lesion; for the dilatation of the blood-vessels is, as we know, accompanied by an increase in the vital properties of the part; hence we find increase of heat and increase of sensibility. Whether this explana- tion is one altogether satisfactory I shall consider afterwards. As the dilatation of the blood-vessels, result- ing from paralysis of the vaso-motor nerves. section of the spinal cord in the dorsal region, sup- pose at 3, would be follow- ed, on the same side as the injury, by paralysis of mo- tion and the symptoms of paralysis of the vaso-motor nerves, f.c., dilatation of the blood-vessels, etc. In this

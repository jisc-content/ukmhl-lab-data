152 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY in its central part, i.e. in the grey matter; and in the following discourse, he enters upon those which show that the conductors of sensitive impressions from the various parts of the trunk and limbs, make their decussation in the spinal cord, and not in the encephalon, as had been generally supposed. He commences by proving that the theory of Longet, with regard to the posterior columns of the cord being the conduct- ors of sensitive impressions, is no longer tenable; he carries on the work of destruction commenced by Sir Charles BeU himself, vigorously urged on by the serious objections brought up against this h}"pothesis by Dr. R. B. Todd, supported more recently by the beautiful anatomical researches of Stilling and Lockhart Clarke, and now comple- ted by his own experiment, showing that a trans- verse. section of the posterior columns, far from being followed by any loss offeeling, is cxcompa- nied by the very reverse effect. So far as the posterior columns are concerned, this single ex- periment annihilates the fascinating theory of Longet, which won its way so speedily into full notoriety, and was so charmingly seductive, be- cause “ it was so orderly a plan and made people remember.” But it had no facts to rest upon.

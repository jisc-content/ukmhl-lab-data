LECTURE IV. 97 is specially indicated when any strumous ten- dency exists ; the second class of remedies, useful through the whole course of the disease, is particularly called for during those periods of syphilitic chlorosis (chloro-ana^mia), so usu- ally the forerunner of an outburst of eruption. Warm baths or vapour baths are the most ef- fective means of keeping the skin in action. Medicated baths of various kinds are eminently useful ; baths corresponding with those of the bromated and iodated waters of Kreuznach, the waters of Schlangenbad, Harrogate, Barege.s, can be readily obtained in all our cities. Tonic and exciting medicated baths arc of great service in syphilitic as well as other affec- tions of the skin ; baths containing iodide or sulphuret of potassium, or arseniatc of soda are eminently useful in the ana?mia, chlorosis, or rheumatism connected with syphilis. Dr. Noel Guencau de Mussy recommends three and a-half ounces of subcarbonate of soda, with twenty grains of the arseniate, in a bath. No unprejudiced practitioner will deny the benefit of the Turkish and Russian baths. We have no means of inducing diaphoresis compar- able to these.

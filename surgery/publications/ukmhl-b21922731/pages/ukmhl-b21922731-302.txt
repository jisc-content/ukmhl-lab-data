284 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY this rabbit upon which I have operated ; the in- jury, as you observe, in both these specimens engages just one-half of the cord, and you can see by the ribs here remaining, that the upper part of the lumbar region was the seat of opera- tion. These facts alone are sufficient to prove that sensitive impressions starting from one limb, sup- pose the right, are propagated upwards to the sensorium along the opposite side of the cord (the left)â€”in other words, that a decussion takes place. But Brown-S^cpiard does not rest satisfied with- out further proof, for he finds that after hav- ing made first a section of a lateral half of the spinal cord in the dorsal region on the right side, and after having ascertained that the right poste- * rior limb is quite sensitive when the left lateral half of the spinal cord is divided in the cervical region, then the right posterior limb loses its sen- sibility. This experiment shows that the sensi- tive impressions coming along the cord, had first crossed to the other side of the spinal cord, along which they were transmitted until interrupted by the second section in the ceiwical region. He has also performed the following delicate experiment: The spinal cord is laid bare in the whole lum-

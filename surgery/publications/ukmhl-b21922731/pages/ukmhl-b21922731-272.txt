254 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY, ETC. Violent mechanical excitation of the medulla oblongata produces a similar stopping of the heartâ€™s action. When a violent and sudden emo- tion causes death, it is, he supposes, by acting on the medulla oblongata that it has such a powerful effect; as an excitation is thus produced on the par vagum, which appears to have its true origin in the neighbourhood of the nib of the calamus scriptor'ius, and in consecpience the blood-vessels of the heart contract, and expel the blood they contained, and with it, the natural excitement which causes the movements of the heart, so that a complete syncope and death take place. Whether this ingenious theory satisfies you, I know not; to my mind it does not meet all the exigen- cies of the case, for why, then, should the heart continue for a time to pulsate rhythmically, when entirely removed from the body, and when all circulation through its vessels must have ceased? Moreover, we may ask what causes it to commence pulsating again when once stopped; what propels again the stimulating fluid through its own capillaries before its own action is evoked ? But in the next lecture we shall con- sider the theoretic views of others, as well as the practical bearings of the influence of the nerves on the vascular system.

146 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY cannot at the present time be accepted as exact, yet it will be found that it contains important elements of tiaitli, in assigning to the grey matter conducting power. Tt is a remarkable instance of how much may be done l)y bold assertion, even when altogether unsupported by facts, that it has been so general- ly believed that the grey matter is devoid of the power of conducting impressions, and that its true function is dynamical—that it is destined to produce nerve force. A moment s reflection serves to show that every nerve, after separation from the cerebro-spinal axis, nevertheless contains in itself the elements necessar)^ to originate the vis nervosa or neurility,'*'’ as it has been very well named, for this force may be called into being l)y the excitation of ever so small a portion of such a nerve by electrical, chemical, or mechani- cal stimulation. On the other hand, however much the minute anatomist may have failed to point out precisely what becomes of the roots of the nerves—whatever discrepancies may exist among the researches of Hannover, Stilling, Ei- genbrodt, Blattmann, Kolliker, Wagner, Lock- hart Clarke, Schilling, Gratiolet, Owsjanuikow, * Au admirable term, for which we aie iudebted to E. H. Lewes.

232 A NEW THEORY OF NERVOUS ACTION. tinct. The peculiar modifications of taste, as the taste of water after eating artichokes, or of port wine after cheese, etc., are analogous phenomena. The remarkable effects also of lead poisoning upon sensation, of santonine on the optic nerve, etc., appear to me more readily explicable upon the undulatory hypothesis than upon that of distinct conductors. Organs of special sense are of course endowed with distinct conductors for vision, hearing, smell. There are cases to show that the forepart of the tongue is separately endowed with conduc- tors for taste, distinct from those for tactile and thermic impressions ;* but this is a very different thing from resolving each variety of special sen- sation into so many elementary sensations, ea^ih having a distinct channel for its conduction. * See the case of double facial palsy with observations on the physiology of the nerves supplying the forepart of the tongue, by the author, communicated to the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Society, London, March, 1875, Also of paralysis of the fifth pair.

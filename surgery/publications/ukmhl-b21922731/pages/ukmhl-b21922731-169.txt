AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 151 pointed by the Society de Biologic, and composed of M]\I. Cl. Bernard, Bouley, P. Broca, Girald6s, Goubaux, and Vulpian. At page 42 of his lectures Dr. Brown-S^quard himself observes in a note ; “I must say, that it is absolutely impossible to know, while we make a section of parts of the spinal cord, what is the precise depth of the in- jury; it is mere guess work. But if we study’ well the phenomena, and then after having killed the animal, if we put the spinal cord in alcohol, we render it hard, and we can ascertain exactly what is the extent of the lesion. This Is the means that I always employ in my experiments ; and it is also the means employed by the com- mittee appointed by the Society de Biologie, for the investigation of my researches on the spinal cord.” I think then, that notwithstanding the great and admitted difficulties which surround experi- mentation on the spinal cord, much weight must be given to testimony derived from results tested by so rigid a process. In his second lecture. Dr. Transmission Brown-S(^*quard details the experi- of sensitive ]^y ^q^ich he hopcs to prove in the cord, that the transmission of sensitive im- pressions in the spinal cord, takes place chiefly 11

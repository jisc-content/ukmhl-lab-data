AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 153 If, then, the transmission of sensitive impres- Channel for sions does not take place along the trausmiMion columns, it remains to be impressions, found wliat is the channel of their transmission. Is it the grey matter, or some part of the lateral or anterior columns, or aU, or several, of these constituents of the spinal cord ? When the anterior columns alone are dmdcd there is no marked alteration of sensibility. Transverse section of the two lateral columns, in the dorsal region, does not diminish, but in- creases sensibility in the posterior limbs; while sensibility is lost in these parts when the entire spinal cord, with the exception of one lateral col- umn, is divided transversely: hence, it seems that sensitive impressions are not transmitted through these channels. It is quite different with regard to the grey matter. A transverse section of the posterior half of tlie .spinal marrow is attended with diminished sensibility in the posterior extremities; but as we already know that this loss of sensibility Ls not attributable to the division of the posterior, and the portions of the lateral columns thus unavoid- ably divided, it seems necessarily to lie due to the division of the grey matter.

When at length these are not inoculable, fresh matter is employed, and the above process is repeated until a positive result can no longer be obtained on the trunk. The same practice is then commenced on the arms, and continued there until the punctures fail; when a similar process is pursued on the thighs until no more postules result, and a condition of immunity, more or less perfect, is arrived at.

1G6 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY On the same side as the injury. Power of movement is lost; sensibility con- tinues. On the opposite side to the injury. Power of movement con- tinues; sensibility is lost. 2ndly. If, after having made, first a section of a lateral half of the spinal cord in the dorsal region on the right side, and after having ascer- tained that the right posterior limb is quite sen- sitive, the left lateral half of the spinal cord is divided in the cervical region, then the right pos- terior limb loses its sensibility. This experiment shows that the sensitive impressions coming along pr (after the lesion at 3), had first crossed to the other side of the spinal cord, along which they were transmitted, until interrupted by the second section, not represented in the diagram. 3rdly. The spinal cord is laid bare in the whole lumbar region, and a careful division of the entire extent of the part of the organ, giving origin to the nerves of the posterior limbs, is made directly along the middle line, so as to separate the two lateral halves of the organ one from the other. If this experiment could be executed perfectly, nothing would be divided in the cord except the commissures which unite the right and left sides,

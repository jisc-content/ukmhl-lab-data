Of these four, one is taking, and one has used, mercurials ; two have not, and, I hope, never need take any. To point out to you the principles which guide me in making this important difference in treat- ment shall be the object of my next lecture. In conclusion, I would observe that, in the wards of an hospital like this, you meet with a larger number of cases requiring the use of mercury, as a remedial agent, than you will meet with in ordinary practice ; and for this very simple reason—the slighter cases, the cases of what Diday calls “ verole faible,” do not require to come into hospital for treatment. The bulk of the cases of syphilis which you see here are severe, or malignant syphilis.

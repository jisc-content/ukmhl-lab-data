260 LECTCTRES ON PHYSIOLOGY very much. So free and rapid is the circulation of the blood through the dilated vessels of the gland, that the blood in its passage through them is not changed into venous blood, but comes from the veins of a bright arterial red, and even springs from an opening in the vein in jets as if from an artery. When, on the contrary, the twig of the lingual is severed, the filaments of the sympathetic remaining uninjured, the shrunken aspect of the gland indicates the contracted state of its vessels, and the retarded circulation causes the blood in the veins to be of a dark venous hue. Corresponding but reversed effects may be pro- duced by galvanizing the divided nerves—that is to say, galvanization of the sympathetic is fol- lowed by contraction, that of the lingual by dila- tation of the vessels. It must be confessed that as yet no satisfac- tory explanation has been offered of these pheno- mena of contraction and dilatation of blood- vessels. The view of Professor Bernard, that there are two distinct classes of vaso-motor nerves—one presiding over contraction, the other over dilatation—and that dilatation as well as contraction is an active process, cannot, 1 con- ceive, in the present state of science, be admitted.

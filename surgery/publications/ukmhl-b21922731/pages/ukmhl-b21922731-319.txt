APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 301 occasion) still exliibits very strikingly this h}’per- sesthesia. You remember that half the spinal cord lias been divided on the right side, and you per- ceive that wliile the left hind leg is insensible, it is quite obvious that the right feds much more acutely than in an animal which had not been operated upon at all. Now, what is to be consi- dered as the true cause of this increase of sensibil- ity, which thus results from the division of a lateral half of the spinal marrow, and which we obser\’e to take place on the same side as the lesion, or which occurs in both hind limbs after section of the posterior columns of the cord ? Wagner has long since pointed out that in approaching their various destinations, the nerv’e fibres divide and suMivide ; these subdivisions with the minute ganglia and oval nuclei, which have been described in dift’erent localities and textures by Bidder, Rosenbei-ger, ^leissner, Beale, Auerbach, and others, constitute what is known as the peripheral expansion of the neivous sys- tem. Tills circumferential portion, if all aggre- gated into one mass, would probably equal or even exceed in bulk the central masses—the brain and cord. H\*peraesthesia (or at least such exaltation of sensibility as we can discover in

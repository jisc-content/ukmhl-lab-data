AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD, 181 I pass then directly to the latter chapters, Yaso-motor which the functions and relations nervous of the vaso-motor portion of the system. ' . n n nervous system are considered; or, in other words, leaving behind what relates to voluntary movements and sensibility, I come to the consideration of the influence of the nervous system on nutrition, animal heat, secre- tion, etc.; and, first, of the physiological and mor- bid actions due to the great sympathetic nerve. There is, perhaps, no department of physiology in which, within a recent period, two or three discoveries have afibrded so comprehensive an elucidation of a large number of comparatively isolated facts, as in that connected with the vaso- motor nervous system. It was probably for the want of these discoveries that the observations of the thoughtful Whytt and of the profound Pro- chaska were so long neglected, and apparently forgotten; or, at aU events, that their real im- portance was by no means understood. The expression of Prochaska with reference to the capability of sensorial being reflected into motor impressions, sufficiently proves that the mind of this great physiologist had grasped the idea, which Le Gallois and Mayo, Marshall Hall and

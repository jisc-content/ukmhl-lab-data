AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL COED. 175 Ollivier’s case,—Loss of feeling of pain on pinching; diminished sensibility to cold, heat, and touch.

The notion of Dr. Brovm-Sdquard seems to lead to the supposition that distinct nerve fibres may exist for each variety of auditor}’ sen- sation; and analog}’ might lead to the supposition that the optic nerve contained distinct conductors for evei-y colour of the spectrum, so that colour- blindness and aljsence of “ear” would find their explanation in deficiency or aljsence of the con- ductoi-s of these sensitive impressions. These speculations, however, touch on subjects of so delicate a nature, that we fetir they are likely to remain for ever merely h}-pothetical. Although, therefore, it appears to me that Dr. Browu-S<5quard’s view wants further evidence for its complete substantiation, I wish to state what exactly are his notions on this subject. It seems to him that the conductors of the various

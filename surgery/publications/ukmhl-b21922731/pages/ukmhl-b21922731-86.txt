LECTURES ON VENEREAL DISEASES. 72 be tlic forerunners of the milder form of syphi- lis.

Thus, from his tables, we find of 170 cases of roseolar eruptions, the primitive lesion was in r4G of them an erosion ; in 24 of them, a hard chancre. 4th. The period of the second incubation. The duration of this j:)eriod has not been accu- rately fixed as yetâ€”that is to say, the period over which it extends. Some authors date it from the time of the impure contact to the time when the secondary lesions declare themselves. Others date it from the day upon which the chancre is observed, up to the period when those constitutional symptoms present themselves, which are about to usher in what we call the secondary lesions. The latter is probably the best definition, and can, generally speaking, be accurately defined, as we can almost always

NERVOUS ACTION. L 001 impressions of touch, tickling, pain, etc., are as distinct one from the other as they all are from the nerve-fibres employed in the transmission of the orders of the will to the muscles.‚Äù The theory which I venture to propose, and which I put forward with diffidence, when I con- sider that another has been advocated by such able physiologists as Helmholtz, Herbert Spencer, and Browm-S^quard, is simply an application of the theory of wave propagation to the passage of various sensations along nerve conductors. I conceive that the various peripheral expan- sions of sensitive nerves take up undulations or vibrations, and convert them into waves capable of being propagated along nervous tissue (neu- rility, as it has been well named by Lewes). Thus the same ners^e tubule may be able to trans- mit along it vibrations differing in character, and hence giving rise to different sensations; and consequently the same neive tubule may, in its normal condition, transmit the wave which pro- duces the idea of simple contact, or that which produces the idea of heat; or, again, the same nerve tubules in the optic nerve which propagate the undulations of red may also propagate, in normal vision, those which excite the idea of yellow or blue, and so for the other senses.

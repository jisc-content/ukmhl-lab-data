APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 259 effect can only be explained by a contraction of the small vessels, for the result is the same whether the pneumogastrics have been pre- ^^ou8ly cut or not. A considerable irritation of the skin gives rise to a like result. Practically speaking, one of the most important direct demonstrations of the contraction of blood- vessels, in oljedience to reflex stimulation, is that shown by Brown-S6quard, wherein the ve.ssels of the spinal marrow contract under the influence of irritiition of the nerv'es of the solar plexus. But of the disclosures of physiology on this subject, perhaps the most remarkable is that brought to light by the observations of Claude Bernard, on the action of the nerves on the vessels of the .sub-maxillary gland of a dog. This gland is supplied with nervâ€™es from two sources. One is a branch of the lingual, the second is derived from the great sympathetic, the filaments of which accompany the artery. These nerves can Ikj easily distinguished, and when acted upon separately, are attended with very" dissimilar re- sults. When the filaments of the sympathetic are divided, the twig from the lingual remaining untouched, the blood-vessels immediately dilate

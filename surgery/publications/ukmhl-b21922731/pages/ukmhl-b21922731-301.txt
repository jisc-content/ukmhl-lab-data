APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 283 Second Experiment.—In this rabbit the result is more striking than in the guinea-pig. I have here dmded, also, the right lateral half of the cord in the lower part of the dorsal region. You see how marked are the effects in this animal. Left hind limh (uninjured side). Colder than its fellow. Perfectly insensible. Pow’er of movement continues. Right hind limb (side of lesion). Distinctly hotter than its fellow. Ver}’- sensitive. Power of movement lost. You see that the right hind limb is so very sensi- tive, that, when pinched, the animal gives signs of feeling, even much more acute than these passive creatures usually do when in the natural state. The increase of warmth on the side of the le- sion is quite unmistakably evident to the hand, and the paralysis of movement is equally obvious. Here are the spinal cords of two rabbits up- on which Brown-St^quard himself operated; as I have already said in this theatre, they have been hardened in spirit, so as to enable one to make a careful inspection of the lesion; during life the symptoms were exactly what you see in

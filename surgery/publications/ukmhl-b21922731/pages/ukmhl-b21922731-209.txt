AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 191 aud by the results of this afflux; and fourthly, that its excitation, whether direct or reflex, is iiharacterised by a contraction of the blood-ves- sels, and the results of this contraction. The origin of the cervical sympathetic has been indi- cated by Augustus Waller and Budge, as taking place between the sixth cervical and fourth dor- sal vertelirae, and it is probable that it has an origin even more extended. As regards the other fibres of the spnpathetic. Dr. Brown- S6quard believes, that those going to the blood- vessels of the various parts of the head, come out mainly from the spinal cord by the roots of the last cervical, and first and second dorsal neives. Their real place of origin he thinks to be paidly the spinal cord, and partly the higher portions of the encephalon, but chiefiy the medulla ob- longata and the neighbouring parts of the ence- phalon. In the other parts of the body, the ueives of the blood-vessels seem to come chiefiy from the cerebro-spinal centre as well as the cervical sympathetic. On division of a lateral half of the spinal cord in the dorsal region, we find in the lower limb on the same side, most of the eftects of a section of the sympathetic in the neck, viz.: dilatation of the

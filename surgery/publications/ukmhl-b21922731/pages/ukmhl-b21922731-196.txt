178 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY this is not what occurs. After lesion of the spinal cord, engaging more or less of the grey matter, sensibility is not completely destroyed in certain places, remaining perfect in other parts : but sensibility is diminished, and apparently equally diminished, in all parts posterior to the lesion ; and this diminution of sensibility continues to be- come more marked, the more the grey matter is divided—until, when the anterior columns alone remain, anaesthesia is established. Thus, while one is certainly induced to lielieve that the grey matter of the cord conducts sensitive impressions fis a whole—and not, as a nerve, by separate con- ductors coming from particular points—it is evident that the conductors in the spinal cord are not so arranged, as to follow distinct channels, running in bundles, in continuation of the nerve roots, nor does it seem probable that such is tme for the conductors of pain, touch, tickling, etc. Indeed this, among other things, would incline one much more to regard the spinal cord as a nerve tubule on a very large scale, than as a large nerve composed of many independent conductors, as has been the view of many. Looked upon as a gigantic nerve tubule, the spinal cord may be considered as having, in its investing membrane.

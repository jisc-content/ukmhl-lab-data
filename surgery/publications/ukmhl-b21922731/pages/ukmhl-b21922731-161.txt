AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 143 above stated. If it be not so, then, indeed, a very- useful lesson is to be drawn from the deductions of the learned Professor. AVe are taught how very dangerous it is to hang physiological theo- ries upon a frame-work, such as the anatomist sees, or fancies he sees, in the structures of the nervous centres. But it will become my duty, further on, to analyse the reasonings of Professor Schroeder van der Kolk, when comparing them with those of Brown-S^quard. Passing from these, as I may call them, sub- Tworivaitheo- Ordinate theories, concerning the nes re^d- pj-gcise functions of the various tracts mgthefuuc- ^ tions of the of the spinal cord, I come to the ■ two great rivals which have for some time struggled, with var}’ing success, for accept- ance before the leading physiologists of Europe, viz., that of Sir Charles Bell, as modified by M. Louget, which had been generally adopted in France and England; and that for the most part admitted in Germany, and, with many minor nmdifications, adopted by Van Deen, Valentin, Stilling, and otlieis.

NEKVOUS ACTION. 225 As the rays of the heat, light, and actinic spectra differ in refrangibility, so do the undu- lations produced by heat, cold, pain, tickling, or the unfelt sensation (if I may use the phrase), which last correspond to the invisible and cold actinic rays. As in the economy of nature the actinic rays play a piirt of vast importance, so these vibrations, which play along our nerv'es, without our know- ing it, are all-important in the animal economy. The unfelt tickling which keeps the heart in regular and ceaseless action during life, is not less important to man than that part of the sun- beam which we cannot see, nor yet feel the warmth of, is in the economy of nature. The idea which I wish to convey is illustrated by the absorption bands occurring in different parts of the visible spectnim, when various mat- ters are submitted to examination in the spectro- scope. Perhaps, however, the intercepting of calorific waves by gases, or by the infinitely minute quantity of matter persuading the atmos- phere in the form of perfume, fonns even a more striking illustration. Professor Tyndalls well knouTi experiment on this subject is thus carried out. The source of waves which he selects for

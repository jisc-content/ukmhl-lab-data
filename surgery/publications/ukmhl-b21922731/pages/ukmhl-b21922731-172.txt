1 54 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY verse section of the anterior half of the spinal cord is also attended with diminished sensibility ; but, since we know that this loss is not attribu- table to the division of the anterior columns and of the portions of the lateral columns, it seems again that it must be due to the division of the grey matter. Lastly; if the anterior, lateral, and posterior columns are divided transversely, at a little distance from each other, sensibility persists behind the sections, the grey matter being the only channel which remains for its propagation towards the encephalon. As in this experiment it is impossible not to divide some of the grey matter, sensibility is found diminished, but not destroyed. If one can feel thoroughly satisfied as to these facts, there can be no doubt respect- ing the inference, that sensitive impressions pass, principally, along the grey matter in the spinal cord. Dr. Brown-S^quard, however, does not negative the notion of Calmed and Nonat, that the anterior columns have a share in this func- tion, for he has found that when the entire spi- nal cord has been cut across, leaving only the anterior columns, sensibility, which is at first lost, after a time reappears, and many hours after- wards e^ddently exists everywhere, though in a

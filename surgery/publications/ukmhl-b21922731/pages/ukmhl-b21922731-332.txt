314 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY first by a series of shocks from the induction coil, tlie second l)ecomes also tetanized. But further, you see that when the tension upon the hook pre- vents the first muscle from contracting altogether, that even the tendency to contract is followed by the secondary contraction in the insulated leg. 1 now cut across the tendo Achillis; you see how striking and instantaneous is the result. Gal- vanization now, as before, makes the muscle of the first leg contract, but no contraction follows in the second; the resistance being gone, there is no galvanic excitation sufficient to disturb the second leg. So, in any voluntary contraction, the disturb- ance of the galvanic cquililmum is greater in pro- portion as the resistance is greater, and this disturbance (diminution according to Du Bois Beymond of the muscular current), is felt and appreciated by the special nerves of the muscular sense. Such is the ingenious theory of Browii- St^quard on this subject. In drawing to a conclusion this short course of lectures, I wish to show the strange result of one of the experiments which you have already wit- nessed in giving rise to epileptiform disease. J need not say that the practical physician cannot

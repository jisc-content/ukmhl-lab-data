APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 303 clothes, is insiifFerable. Sometimes after injuries to the spine, the surface, even in a few minutes, becomes so exquisitely sensitive, that the slightest touch is productive of intense agony.* We have abeady seen that when the sympa- thetic nerve is dmded in the neck of a rabbit, the ear on the same side becomes warmer, more vascular, and more sensitive than the other ; and we have found that the same phenomena, as to increase of heat and sensibility, are met vdth on the same side as the section, in the posterior limb after division of a lateral half of the spinal cord. We are therefore at first naturally led to suppose that in each experiment the vaso-motor nerve- fibres being divided, and the blood-vessels para- lyzed, the increased vascularity consequent upon this gives ri.se to the increase of sensibility. An exceedingly interesting experiment of Dr. Brown-Sdquard, proves that in the latter instance, at all events, there is another cause for the hyper- sesthesia to be sought for. In his paper, entitled “ Experimental Researches on Various Questions Concerning Sensibility,” read before the Royal Society, in May, 1860, he says that in a rabbit, in * See a case reported by Dillon Kelly, Esq., in The Dublin Hospital Gazette^ 18fi4, p. 103.

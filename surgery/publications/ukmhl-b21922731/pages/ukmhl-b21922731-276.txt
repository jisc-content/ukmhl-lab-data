LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 258 siding influence exercised over it by the cere- bro-spinal centres—at times being stimulated to increased activity, at times checked or controlled by what has been called inhibitory action. The efiect of galvanizing the pneumogastric nerves, and thereby checking or entirely stopping the rhythmical action of the heart, finds a counter- part deseiwing of attention in Pfliiger’s experi- ment, in which the peristaltic action of the in- testine is controlled by strongly galvanizing the splanchnic nerves. In operating upon the large edible frog of the continent, the same physio- logist has succeeded in applying the galvanic stimulus to the anterior roots of the sciatic nerve within the spinal canal, and thereby causing complete constriction of the arteries of the webs. Division, on the other hand, of the same roots was followed by full dilatation of the vessels. It can be shown by the aid of a ha^modyna- mometer placed in communication with the caro- tid, that a considerable part of the blood-vessels of the body become contracted under certain circumstances. Thus this instrument indicates a notable increase of blood'pressure, when in a do2f. whose sciatic nerve has been cut across, the central end of the nerve has been excited. This

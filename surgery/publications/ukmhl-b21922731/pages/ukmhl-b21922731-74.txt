^)0 LECTURES ON VENEREAL DISEASES. During ten years, while I was Medical Super- intendent of the Mountjoy Convict Prison, I met with fifty-four cases of syphilis. This is a small array when compared with the hundreds and thousands which figure in the statistics of some. The power of accurate observation within prison walls, the certainty and precision of the facts, the removal of many of the disturbing influ- ences which confound results and observations made on ordinary patients; above all, the power of Avatching for years the undisturbed progress of the case, give, ho'wever, a great scientific value to observations made within the precincts of a convict prison. Of my fifty-four cases, thirteen were from the first under my owm care, never having been interfered with by any treat- ment until after their committal to prison. Of these thirteen, two only appeared to need mer- curial treatment; the rest got well under that simple, rational, hygienic treatment which can be so w^ell carried out within a prison, where habits of dissipation are at an end, and time is no object.

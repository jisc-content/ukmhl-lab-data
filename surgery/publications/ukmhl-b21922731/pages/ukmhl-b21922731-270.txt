252 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY the pulsations are still too rapid to be reckoned— they can hardly l)c less than 200 per minute. I now bring the wires in contact with the nerves— the heart at once almost ceases to beat—its pul- sations arc reduced to eighteen per minute. When I break contact, you perceive it quickly recovers, and pulsates as rapidly as ever. 1 again make contact, giving the strongest shocks which this rather feeble induction coil can give with the one small cell of a Daniel’s battery. You see it is not quite, but almost quite stopped, and between the contractions, which now take place irregularly, the heart lies perfectly flaccid, and becomes distended with blood. I cannot, in this instance, succeed in completely stopping the heart; my induction coil is not strong enough. Some of you have ah-eady seen me succeed in doing this, and at all events the eflects, as you now witness them, are sufficiently striking. At this moment, again, you see the heart is pulsating as fast as ever. You now perceive that galvanization of the pneumogastric neiwes produces upon the muscular structure of the heart an eflect totally diiferent from that produced upon an ordinary muscle, by galvanizing its motor nerve. When I place the

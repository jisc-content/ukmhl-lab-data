188 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY a check upon action, seems a very startling inno- vation in physiology, and one which we must be very cautious about accepting, so long as the same phenomena may be accounted for by the supposition of a more simple, comprehensive, and uniform action in those nerve-fibres, which seem to preside over the movements of involuntary muscles. Indeed, we cannot help looking for- ward to a further development of the notions shadowed forth by Lister—that the peripheral expansions (ganglia and nuclei, etc.) of the ner- vous system are in all cases essential to these contractions of vessels, etc., and while capable of independent action, are nevertheless susceptible of being stimulated^ or checked by the governing influence of the central nervous system; the so- called inhibitory influence being due to the more or less energetic operation of the same nerve- fibres, and bearing a remote analogy with that almost, if not entirely, passive condition of the nervous system, which gives rise to muscular tonicity.* * The view liere put forward is, I conceive, that now very gen- erally accepted by physiologists. An able reviewer of Vulpiau’s lately published work on the vaso-motor apparatus thus epito- mizes his observations on the subject: “ As was to be expected, various attempts have been made to

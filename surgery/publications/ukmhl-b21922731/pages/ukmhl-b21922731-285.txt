267 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. novelty in the matter, for long ago Robert Wliytt, Prochaska, and others (who, it must be admitted, were men much in advance of their time as phy- siologists), showed by their writings that they had a very comprehensive knowledge of this vastly important subject, and their \dews received an amazing development by the labours of Mayo, Marshall Hall, etc. It is in the physical explan- ation of many reflex phenomena through the action of the vaso-motor nerves, that there lies the real merit of the investigations of modern physiologists. It is in the fact that the presiding influence of this portion of the nervous system over the vessels may give rise, by reflex action, to inflammation and to those changes in nutrition (sometimes augmenting, sometimes diminishing it) which are so closely akin to the inflammatory process. In the practical application of the study of reflex phenomena to the investigation of disease, there has assuredly been no physician who has done more than our own illustrious Graves. One cannot now read the lectures of this accomplished teacher without fancying with what delight, were he still among us, he would watch the progress of modern science day by day illuminating the

It is known that the brain proper does not, on mechanical irritation, give rise to convulsions; superficial portions of the brain have been re- moved by the hand of the surgeon without the production of convulsions. But the question is, may not alterations of nutrition produce altera- tions of function 1 Must not such changes of nutrition, as we know as a matter of fact, alter the chemical composition of the brain in idiots . and epileptics—alter its functions, and amongst others, its capability of being irritated and ex- cited, so as to give rise to convulsive movements 1 AVe find many analogous cases in other parts of the animal economy. Third Experiment.—In this guinea-pig, about a month ago, I divided a lateral half of the spinal cord; you see the hind limbs have nearly re- covered ; the animal looks well, feeds weU, and is apparently healthy. The cornea of the right eye has become opaque. When I tickle or nip the body, or nose, or ears, it does him no harm ; but

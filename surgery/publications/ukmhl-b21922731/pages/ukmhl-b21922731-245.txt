227 NERVOUS ACTION. Suppose the glass tube, through which the waves of heat pass from the copper plate to be exhausted by an air pump. Perfectly equal quantities of heat are now permitted to reach the opposite faces of the pile, so that the needle points to zero. Now let the molecules of any gas enter the exhausted tube; if these molecules pos- sess any power of intercepting the heat waves coming from the copper, the equQibriuni will be destroyed, the opposing face of the })ile will tri- umph, and the needle will leave the zero point. From the deflections produced by pemiitting gases, vapours, and perfumes to enter the ex- hausted tube. Professor Tyndall has deduced the relative amounts of wave motion intercepted by their molecules. He thus finds that, the heat waves intereepted by atmospheric air being taken as unity, the amount absorbed by the following gases stand thus in relation to each other: Air Oxygen Nitrogen ... Carbonic acid Sulphurous acid Relative Absorption. 1 1 1 972 6,480 Some vapours allow the waves a comparatively

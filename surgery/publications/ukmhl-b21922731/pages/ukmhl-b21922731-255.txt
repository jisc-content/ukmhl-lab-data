Even among medical men, many forget or are ignorant that the principles which they daily apply in practice, are based on facts primarily obtained by the experimental physiologist; just as he who works the telegraph forgets or is ignorant that the primary discovery of galvanism is due to the frog, and that if num- bers of these creatures had not been immolated on the altars of science, our telegraphs would not exist. A little reflection must, 1 conceive, convince most people that the entire aspect of medical and surgical practice has been modified through the knowledge derived from ex|)eriment8 on animals. 1 do not speak only of the experi- ments by incision, for I fancy that all painful experiments must be embraced under the same head.

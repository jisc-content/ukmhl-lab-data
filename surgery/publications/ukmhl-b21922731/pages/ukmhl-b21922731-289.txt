271 APPLIED TO PRACTICE. side of the eyeball, as any of ypu may soon satisfy yourselves, produces such a disturbance of the flow of blood to the retina, that the power of \*ision is lost, but returns at once on removing the pressure. I at one time thought that the pressure on the eyebsdl prevented the hflflux of arterial blood, and thus paralyzed the retina ; but it is not so. I have submitted my owm eye to examination with the ophthalmoscope under these circumstances, and have examined in return the eye of a scientific friend who was wOling to submit to the experiment. We were both satis- fied that the pre.ssure produced great venous con- gestion of the retina, and that the circulation was retarded by obstruction on the venous sideâ€”the eyeball being pressed backwards upon the oph- thalmic vein. The so-called %dcarious fluxes which take the place of the menstrual discharge, must be the result of a vascular turgescence produced in a remote part by a reflex irritation starting from the uterine system. Urticaria, connected wdth uterine disturbance, is by no means uncommon. I have known a lady for a considerable time pre- vented from going into society on account of the sudden appearance of blotches of urticaria, con-

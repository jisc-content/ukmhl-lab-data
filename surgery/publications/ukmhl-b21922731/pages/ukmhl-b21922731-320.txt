LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 302 animals l)y pricking, pinching, etc.) seems to re- sult from two distinct conditions, viz., either from increased vascularity of the circumferential por- tion, or of j)ortions of the cerehro-spinal centres. Of the first we have a familiar example in the increased, sensitiveness of the surface following the application of a sinapism. The increased vascularity of the surface produces an exaltation of sensibility in the circumferential parts of the neiwe ramifications, as any of you may readily satisfy yourselves by placing a mustard poultice for a few minutes on the front of the forearm, and then making a comparison between the rela- tive sensibility of it and the opposite one, by gently nipping or pricking the surface of each. But, again, you know that hyperaesthesia of the surface sometimes occurs as a consequence of a condition the very reverse of that just mentioned; it is the result of inflammation or increased vascularity of the centres. You have, no doubt, observed the great tenderness of surface which, especially in children, forms so striking a symp- tom of cerebro-spinal meningitis ; you have seen how the patient whimpers and cries out when the finger is ever so lightly passed over the surface â€”how, sometimes, the pressure even of the bed-

174 CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE PHYSIOLOGY to ilssign to each its local habitation; so, before we can assign different conductors to each variety of sensitive impression, must we determine what are the various sensitive impressions which are fundamentally distinct* from one another. We may incline to admit the general truth of Dr. Brown-S6quard’s view with reference, for in- stance, to the appreciation of weight through mus- cular action, as distinct from the feeling of heat, while we regard touch, tickling, ordinary pain, i\a mere phases of one more general sensation, de- pending perhaps, in their varieties, upon the tex- ture of the skin, the hair, etc. It Is certain, however, that the analysis of cases given by Dr. Brown-S(iquard lends considerable weight to his idea: Thus, Case 24 is reported as having lost the feeling of pinching, pricking, and muscular sensi- bility; sensibility to cold and tickling remaining. Case 23.—Loss of the feeling of tickling or contact; persistence of the feeling of pain. Case 13.—Loss of tactile sensibility ; increased sensibility to painful impressions. Dr. Budd’s case (Medico-Chirurgical Transac- tions), in which contact was felt while heat was not perceived.

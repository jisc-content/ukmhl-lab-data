AXD PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 165 view, in which, suppose the lesion marked number 3 to be made in the dorsal or lumbar region, and let ar represent the anterior or motor nerve root, continued on by a dotted line to its decussation in the anterior p}’ramid, while pr represents the posterior, or sensitive nerve root, also continued through its supposed decussation, by a dotted line. For the present let us disregard the in- crease of sensibility, a phenomenon which we shall subsequently consider, and we have the following results of a complete section of one half of the spinal cord in the dorsal or lumbar region. per lumbar region. The arrows indicate the direction of the nervous action in the motor and sensitive conductors.—The diagram is copied from Dr. Brown-S^uard’s work.

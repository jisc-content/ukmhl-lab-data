71 LECTURE III. 2nd. The first incubation—that is to say, the period which elapses from the time of the im- pure contact until the moment when the sore becomes apparent—is a point upon which we can sometimes obtain precise information, and, when we can, information of great importance. It may be laid down as a general rule, that the longer the period of incubation the less virulent tlie infection. We have already seen that con- siderable difference of opinion exists with refer- ence to the duration of this period of the first incubation. In ten cases of inoculation from secondary lesions, the mean incubation has been 28 days ; in two cases of inoculation from pri- mitive lesions, the mean incubation has been 18 days; while Diday assigns 14 days as the mean period for incubation in the ordinary run of cases. As in gonorrhoea, so in syphilis, the longer the period of incubation, the less virulent, in all probability, the nature of the virus ; but in truth we cannot build much upon this with reference to our prognosis. 3rd. Ihe primitive lesion, that is to say, the chancre and its characters, have been thoroughly studied, and appear to afibrd some important testimony. The initial lesions, unattended with much induration, may be stated, as a rule, to

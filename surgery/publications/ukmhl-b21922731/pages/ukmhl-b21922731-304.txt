286 LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY suredly do) that the results may be accepted, then the inferences from them are clear and undeniable. So much so, that it is unnecessary here to point out how completely the third experiment disproves the notion of some physiologists, that the grey matter has the power of transmitting impres- sions in every direction. I purposely omit at present to speak of some of the phenomena which you have seen in these experiments to-day, viz : the increase of tempe- rature and of sensibility in the hind limbs on the same side upon which the half of the cord is divided. I shall in another lecture speak on this subject. But you see that the same experiment which shows that the conductors of sensation decussate in the spinal cord, proves also that the conductors which convey the commands of the will to muscles do not decussate in the cord. Yet from time immemorial it has been known that they do decussate somewhere; for, as you know, an apoplectic clot on one side of the brain produces paralysis of the opposite of the body; where then does the decussation of motor con- ductors take place ? Pathology leads to the answer â€”at the lower part of the medulla oblongata, but not extensively along the middle line of the base of the encephalon.

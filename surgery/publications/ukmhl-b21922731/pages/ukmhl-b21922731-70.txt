The minor ills arising from the use of mer- curials meet us at every turn. Cases like the following are of almost daily occurrence :— A young man, as a boy the healthiest of a very healthy family, met with a severe injury of the eye.

In such cases the gums often recede from the teeth; neuralgic and rheumatoid pains pester the patient ; he is a weaker vessel than he was before j convalescence from slight illness is slow. Such individuals are more a prey than their neighbours to that slighter form of melan- cholia which we commonly call “ the blues.”

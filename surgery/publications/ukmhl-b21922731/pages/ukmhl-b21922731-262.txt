LECTURES ON PHYSIOLOGY 244 First experiment.—The temperature of my left hand, as indicated by the thermometer (Fahren- heit’s) which I grasp in it, is at present 90®, a second thermometer placed in my mouth, stands at 99°. I now plunge my right arm into this vessel of melting ice, and Dr. Cruise will write down the result after five minutes. Left hand ... ... 86° Mouth ... ... 99° Right hand, or rather ice water 44° You see from these figures that the result is this—the general temperature of the circulating fluid, as evidenced by the heat of the mouth, undergoes no change; but the considerable cold- ness of the right upper limb is followed by a sympathetic loss of warmth in the left, amounting in this instance to four degrees. But Dr. Brown-S^quard, after repeating this experiment several times on himself and others, found that there is no regularity in the amount of heat lost by the hand which remains out of the water; in one of his experiments, the hand kept in the atmosphere lost 22° F. in seven minutes, while the temperature of the mouth was not diminished more than the fifth of a degree, F.

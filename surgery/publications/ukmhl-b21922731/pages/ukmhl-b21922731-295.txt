I shall to-day direct your attention especially to the discovenes of Brown-S6quard, and to his views concerning the tninsmission of sensitive impreasions, and of the commands of the will to the muscles through the medulla spinalis and oblongata. Since the year 1838, this physio- logist has devoted all the time he could to the study of many important questions connected with the functions of the nervous centres ; and his labors, as I believe, have been cro^vned with the most signal success; nevertheless, gentlemen, the

AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD. 147 Schroeder van der Kolk, Bidder, Remak, Kup- fer, and othersâ€”the great majority of these anato- mists, at least agree that a great number of the fibres from the posterior nerve roots pass directly into the grey substance. In this fact alone we have good anatomical evidence that the grey mat- ter is connected with the transmission of sensitive impressions. We find, like^dse, strong presump- tive evidence to the same effect, in the circum- stance that so many most skilful experimentali.sts, engaged in investigations quite independently of each other, and differing in some respects widely from one another, have nevertheless agreed in atti-ibuting to the grey matter some share in the transmission of sensitive impressions. The hypothesis of ^larshall Hall has nothing in it directly at variance with such a supposition; that of Todd and Bowman assumes that all nen^es are implanted in the grey matter, and do not pass beyond it, and that the segments of the cerebro-spinal axis are connected with each other through the continuity of the grey matter ; Wilde Bellingeri, Valentin, Schiff, Van Deen, Volkmann, StOling, and other physiologists, are led by their experiments, however contradictory in other respects, to grant to the grey matter conducting power.

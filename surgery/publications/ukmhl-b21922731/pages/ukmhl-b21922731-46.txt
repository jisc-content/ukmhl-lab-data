In short, gentlemen, when we find that the usual characteristics of the syphilitic sore differ so from the usual characteristics of the simple sore, that fVe toe in the former : Almost always a solitary sore ; A hard sore; Incubation of some weeks ; Adhesive inflammation ; Incapability of inoculation up- on the pei'sou who has the sore ; Not to be destroyed by exci- sion or caustics; Constantly accompanied by indolent, hard bubo; Producing in due course se- condary symptoms; Influenced by so-called specific treatment; and We see in the latter : Very often several sores at the same time. A soft sore. No incubation. Suppurative iuflamnuition. Capability of inoculating an in- definite number of times the person who has the sore. Able to be completely de- stroyed. When accompanied by bubo suppuration soon following. Purely local in its effects. Uninfluenced by specifics.

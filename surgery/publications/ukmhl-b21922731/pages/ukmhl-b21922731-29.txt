15 LECTURE I. A.â€”Question of Incubation. The question whether there be any fixed or . Question of definite period between the expo- incuUtion. coiitagion, and the time when the sore makes its first appearance, is one of great scientific interest, and I believe one of great practical importance also. Although we have some valuable evidence upon the subject, the question may be said, however, to be one which is still suh judice. It appears to be of mucli practical importance, because if it be established that a period of some weeks must elapse between the exposure to infection and the first appearance of the disease, it becomes probable that when the disease actually becomes apparent in the form of a chancre the sysfem is already infected. Analogy would lead us to suppose that such a period of incubation does exist, as we know it does in small-pox, measles, and such complaints ; and it must follow as a corollary, assuming a term of incubation really to exist, that when the disease makes its appear- ance in the tangible form of a chancre, it is al- ready past the hope of remedy by an abortive treatment.

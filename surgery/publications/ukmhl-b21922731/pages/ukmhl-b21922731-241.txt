NERVOUS ACTION. 223 uerve action and the wave theory of light, 1 do not pretend to say that it holds in every respect: there are obvious points of difference. If we infer that light and heat do not consist of par- ticles emitted by a hot body, our natural alterna- tive is to suppose that they are undulations of a medium pervading space. This hypothesis furnishes by far the best explanation of many very curious phenomena in light and heat, and is now generally received. This medium, which we suppose to pervade space likewise, with more or less freedom, pervades transparent and diather- manous bodies; but nerve tissue being neither transparent nor diathermanous, it is not to be conceived that the undulations of this medium are transmitted along ner\^e tissue, as if through glass or rock salt: on the contrary, the vibrations of light and heat are transferred from the medium in question to the axis cylinder of the nerv^e tubule, in a form capable of being propagated to the sensorium. The waves propagated along nerve tubules are probably oscillatory movements accompanied by molecular change. Nerv^ous ac- tion, so far as conduction is concerned, like mus- cular action, is necessarily accompanied by wear and teiu*: decomposition or waste follows it and

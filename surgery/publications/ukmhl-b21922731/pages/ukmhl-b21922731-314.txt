Case 3. * â€” A drummer of the National Guard of Paris had a quarrel with one of his comrades, who was drunk, and who not beinsr able to reach him, flung his sabre at him from a considerable distance, just as he was retreating and had his back towards his antagonist. The point of the instrument reached the upper and back part of the neck. The wounded man at once felt his legs give way under him and fell. He was conveyed next day to the hospital of La Charity. The wound, the borders of which were a little contused, was about two inches in extent; it was situated immediately below the occiput, in the upper and back part of the neck and on the right side. The finger could neither discover the depth of it nor penetrate to the vertebral column. The right arm had lost its power of movement, but preserved its sensibility.

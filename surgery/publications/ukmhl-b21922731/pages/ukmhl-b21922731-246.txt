A NEW THEORY OF 228 free passage; in other cases the minutest bubble of vapour introduced into the tube causes a de- flection of the needle. Assuming the absorption effected by air at a pressure of one atmosphere to be unity, the following are the absorptions effected by certain vapours at a pressure of one- sixtieth of an atmosphere : Eeducing dry air to the pressure of the acetic ether here employed, and comparing them to- gether, the quantity of wave motion intercepted by the latter would be many thousand times that intercepted by aii-. A similar effect is produced by perfumes dif- fused in the air. Carrying, for example, a stream of dry air over bibulous paper moistened with patchouli, the scent taken up by the current absorbs twenty times the quantity of heat inter- cepted ]jy the air which carries it. The following are some of the results obtained with various essential oils; the odour, in each case, being car- ried by a current of dry air into the tube already employed for gases and vapours.

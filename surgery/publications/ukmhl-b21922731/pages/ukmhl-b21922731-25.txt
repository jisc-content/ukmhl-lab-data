11 LECTURE I. Avill not be the forerunner of constitutional syphilis ? In answering this question, I say without hesitation, that it is not possible for any man, however skilful or experienced he may be, to pronounce with certainty whether it will or will not be followed by constitutional symptoms; but, on the other hand, you may often make the diagnosis with the highest degree of probability. If, for instance, you find the characteristic hardness which forms if not an invariable, at least a most important, symp- tom of tlie sypliilitic sore, you may say to your patient that the chances are about a hundred to one that he will some time hence suffer from secondary sypliilis, and this opinion you may form with almost absolute certainty if you find that the hard sore is accompanied by a hard gland which rolls like a marble beneath the skin in the groin. If, on the other hand, you find several sores free from hardness, suppurat- ing freely, you may give your patient good hopes that no constitutional disease is in store for liim ; and you may be more hopeful still if you find in the groin a bubo, which, instead of being hard and indolent, runs rapidly for- ward to suppuration.

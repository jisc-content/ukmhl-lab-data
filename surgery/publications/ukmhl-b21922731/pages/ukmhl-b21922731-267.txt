APPLIED TO PRACTICE. 249 simultaneously obsen^ed that galvanization of the divided sjunpathetic is followed by a reversal of all the phenomena which have been already noticed to follow its division—the vessels contract, heat diminishes, secretion is checked. “The phenomena,” sa3^8 Dr. Brown-Sequard, “ observed after the section or galvanization of this nerv^e, with the exception of a few, may^ l)e summed up under the three following heads:— Section of the Nerve. 1. —Dilatation of blood-vessels. 2. —Afflux of blood. 3. —Increase of \'ital properties. Galvanization of the Nerve. 1. —Contraction of blood-vessels. 2. —Diminution of blood. 3. —Decrease of vital properties. “ Tlie vie'w that the section of the cervical sym- pathetic is followed by a paralysis of the blood- vessels, in consequence of which more blood passes through these vessels in a given time, producing the increa.se of vital properties of the contractile and nersmus tis.sues —this view is now admitted by almost all physiologists. It is based

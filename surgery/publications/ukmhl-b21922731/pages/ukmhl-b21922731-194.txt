17G CRITICAL KSSAY OX THE THYSIOLOGY sensitive impressions pass along distinct fibres, which decussate in the spinal cord ; that none of tliem go up to the brain along the posterior columns. It remains, in his opinion, to be known where the decussation takes place for the nerve fibres conveying different sensitive impres- sions ; ])ut he conceives that for all sorts of sensi- tive conductors save one, there is evidence that their place of decussation is in the immediate neighbourhood of the entrance of the posterior roots into the spinal cord; the conductor's of the kind of sensitive impressions which originate in mu.scles when they contract—impressions which, on being felt, guide our movements— perhaps form an exception, and decussate vei'}’^ high in the spinal cord : in support of which. Dr. Brown-S6quard cites the fact that in most of the cases of alteration of a lateral half of the spinal cord which he has reported, the voluntary move- ments are said to have been unimpeded on the opposite side of the body, which would not have been the case if the ” (juidimj sensation" had not been felt. In one of these cases, however (Case 37), the patient had lost that peculiar muscular sensibility which guides voluntary movement, as she could not hold her child in her arm when she

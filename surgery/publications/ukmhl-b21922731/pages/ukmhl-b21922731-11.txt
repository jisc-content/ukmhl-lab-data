PREFACE. The author has been frequently solicited by his pupils to publish his lectures in a form which would place them Avithin the reach of those Avho have not ready access to the medical journals in which many of them originally appeared. Although gratified by the request, he hesi- tated to comply with it from the feeling that some of what he had Avritten AA'as designed simply for students, AA hile a part aimed higher, and was designed to introduce to the notice of his brother practitioners something Avhich he conceived to be of scientific as Avell as practical novelty. He noAv proposes to OA'^ercome this difficulty by publishing his Lectures, as Avell as his practical and scientific Essays, in separate parts, so that those Avho please may obtain any one part AA'hich may have a special interest for them.

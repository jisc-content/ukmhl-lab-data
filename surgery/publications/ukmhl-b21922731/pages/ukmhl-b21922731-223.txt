AND PATHOLOGY OF THE SPINAL CORD, 205 cause we know that among these animals, the cerebro-spinal system does not (even after the evacuation of the blood of the body) speedily cease to exercise certain functions, and perform movements; and, moreover, I have proved ex- perimentally, that even after decapitation, a blow across the tail stops for a while all the movements which, under ordinary circumstances, persist for a considerable time. The effect, therefore, cannot be attributed to disturbance through the blood- vessels ; it appears rather to be due to an altered molecular condition of the nervous centres, result- ing from the blow, and more or less persistent. That a shock conveyed to the central nervous system through its peripheral nerves, should, with the instantaneousness of a lightning flash, lock in insensibility and motionlessness the entire frame of the creature, cannot, to my satisfac- tion, be accounted for through the action of the vaso-motor trunks upon the blood-vessels, any more than the opposite class of phenomena de- tailed in the following case. â€œ Case 44. On rising in the morning, a lad fourteen years old was heard by his father mak- ing a great disturbance in his bed-room, who.

34 LECTURES ON VENEREAL DISEASES. question of the unity or duality of the syphili- tic poison, it appears to me that the evidence derived from the experiments of AVallace, Wal- ler, and others eannot be got over. Twenty-six times, competent observers have been guilty of the outrage on humanity of inoculating healthy persons with syphilitic poison (an outrage hardly to be justified, it is true, even by the gain to science) ; in every case where the poison took at all, a syphilitic cliancre followed, with subsequent constitutional disease. In twenty-six persons of different ages, sex, strengtli, constitution, &c., in Dublin, Prague, Lyons, Ihiris, Wurzburg, notone simple sore oc- curred with suppurating bubo, and nothing else. Now, knowing what we do about the more usual occurrence of the simple sore, are we to con- clude that, by a remarkable coincidence, all of the persons infected chanced to be fertile syphi- litic soils? or are we to believe that a syphilitic sore in every virgin soil produces its like, and that the simple sore is essentially distinct from it ? This is our dilemma, and, in the present state of knowledge, I take the latter view.

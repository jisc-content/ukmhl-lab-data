The Arrangement of the Lectures on Surgery is founded on the principles laid down by the genius of John Hunter, combined with the present improved state of general and pathological Anatomy. I have been, with diffidence, induced to publish the plan, in the hope of assisting the Student in the prosecution of his studies. To treat Surgical Diseases according to the Anatomy of the Tissues, to shew the alteration peculiar to each structure, appears to me the most favourable method for teaching, and for impressing upon the mind, the scientific Principles of Surgery. During the course, the different modes of operating adopted in this country, and also on the continent, will be practically de- monstrated. w. s. c.

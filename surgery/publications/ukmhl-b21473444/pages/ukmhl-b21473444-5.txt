ADVERTISEMENT. * It is extensively known that in the months of February and March last, meetings were held for the purpose qf obtaining an alteration in some of the regulations of the Council, and Court of Examiners of the Royal College cf- Surgeons; and the following pages loere sketched imme'- diately after attending the first meeting. The manuscript was then laid aside, under an idea that the circumstances ivhich seemed more particularly to call for animadversion might effect their o%on remedy^ I felt reluctant, too', to assume the quality of a censor—fully aicare of my own/ incompetency—and having a strong disinclination to en- gage in controversy. The appearance, however, of Mr. Lawrence's speeches, in a volume published by himself, fixed my resolution to issue what I had written. Still, I do not undertake a direct reply to those speeches, which contain many sentiments to which 1 should cordially assent. In commenting upon and objecting to their spirit, though I felt it my duty to speak strongly, I hope that the courtesy due to a gentleman of great talents and high respectability in his profession, has not been violated. Where I have given utterance to powerful feelings in relation to the labours of another gentleman, I have ab- stained from personality as far as it is possible to do so

53 purer motives—possessing sounder judgment —of larger experience—nor more alive to the uoble and important object of rendering surgery increasingly efficient for the great pur- poses of humanity—we could not place our confidence elsewhere with greater safety or satisfaction. Who can view the Court seve- rally, and not say with respect to most of them, if not of all, that they are men of the highest probity—and occupy the first ranks for their professional attainment—and for the liberal exercise of their talent in the mitigation of human suffering?—Why, it may be asked, should we charge them collectively with that, which no man has temerity enough to impute to them personally, nor even entertains the suspicion that either is capable of?

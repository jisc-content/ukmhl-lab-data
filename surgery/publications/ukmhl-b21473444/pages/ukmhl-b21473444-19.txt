17 that some private pique is indulged, his ex- ertion^ cannot be sanctioned by those who value the estimation of the wisest and best in J society. The expediency of the measures adopted by every one with whom an important trust is deposited, ought to be open to animadversion; but before we impugn the motives of others, we should seek the clearest evidence of their delinquency. Who are the individuals whose conduct in the legislative and executive de- partments of the College has been the object of such severity of censure ? Who are the men who have been held up to ridicule—whose proceedings have been made the objects of burlesque ? Are they men who have been raised to eminence merely by the hand of patronage, or who have arrogated to them- selves distinctions of which they are not fairly deserving? No!—the names of Blizard, and Cline, and Abernethy, and Cooper, and others which might be adduced, at once overthrow such an opinion. These are men whose lau- rels have been fairly won—men who have patiently and perseveringly studied their pro- fession ; who have assiduously executed the important duties which devolve on the Sur- geon ; and who have severally distinguished themselves in the diffusion of anatomical and surgical knowledge.

Whilst those who are unsteady in their pur- suits—negligent in their habits—who do not provide themselves with the means, nor ac- quire the capacity, for prompt and indepen- dent action, can have no real enjoyment in their work; nor will they be outlived by the good fruits of their labour. It has justly been said— " some when they die, die all—■ The space quite closes up through which they pass."

Were I to attempt to discuss the claims of Mr. Abernethy, and of Sir Astley Cooper, to the most respectful con- sideration of the profession, and, indeed, of mankind, it would be an effort of supereroga- tion. I should have the satisfaction, however, of knowing, that whilst I could not enhance their reputation by my praise, neither would a tribute of respect and gratitude diminish it. It was my felicity to study anatomy and surgery under Mr. Abernethy, at the time when Mr. Lawrence was an apprentice to that gentleman—and I shall not cease to remember the reciprocal esteem then manifested between the preceptor and the pupil—nor the very handsome terms in which Mr. Abernethy re- commended to his class the first literary pro- duction of his young friend. However, it is not Mr. Lawrence alone, but a numerous tribe of surgeons also, who will cherish a grateful and pleasing recollection of the advantages philanthropic Chremes, in the Heautontimorumenos of Terence, to be inscribed on the walls of the hospital-surgery, that stu- dents should have constantly before them an admonition to humanity, drawn from a reflection of their own wants; Homo sum; humani nihil a me alienum puto."

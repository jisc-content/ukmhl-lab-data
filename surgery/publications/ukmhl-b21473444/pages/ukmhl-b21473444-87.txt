\ 85 confidence they have been accustomed to bestow on the general practitioner, at the very period when, in other respects, he is most deserving of that confidence. Various means have been suggested to carry this mode of remuneration into effect. But I think a family medical attendant will find it necessary to draw out a statement periodically; and so long as tradesmen adopt the practice of sending in their accounts annually, we, perhaps, cannot with propriety do otherwise. With respect to the manner of making the charge, we must be guided a little by circum stances. The more intelligent part of the com- munity may be satisfied with a line and sum total; and others expecting a detail of the par- ticulars, may be satisfied with an aflixed total without the specification of individual charges. Where the charge must be considerable, and where the circumstances chargeable are scattered over an entire year, they are liable to be forgotten, and the practitioner may be suspected of committing a breach of trust. Instead, therefore, of distinguishing the form of medicine, whether mixtures, draughts, pills, etc; it is preferable to use the terms visit, visit and medicine, medicine, or similar ex- pression, where it may appear requisite to draw out an account; and then to place a sum al the bottom of each page, or a total at the end of the account.

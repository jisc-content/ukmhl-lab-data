64 Creator in the structure of the human fabric, and witnessing; &o habitually the devastations of casuality and disease, under all their varied forms—it is surprising that but few compara- tively have duly appreciated the blessings of Christianity, or even inquired into the eviden- ces of revelation. I am happy however to know, that there are very many amongst us who not only fully and cordially assent to this evidence, but are exemplary in all the duties— personal and relative—private and public, of a religious life. Some of these are men of the most refined taste, whose exertions in the cultivation of science have been the most successful—men capable of realizing, in the highest degree, the pleasures of literature, of science, and of social intercourse: but with all their capacity of delight, the exercises of religion, and the generous impulse it imparts to do good, by mitigating the sorrows of others, afford them gratifications far more exquisite than can be enjoyed through any other source.

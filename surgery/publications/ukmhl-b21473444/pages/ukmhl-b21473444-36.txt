34 which, further observations may be indispen- sably requisite. It has long been known that the formation of a catalogue of the museum has been in contemplation, and it is not un- likely, that some of the more important speci- mens may be engraved, and if so, we perceive a sufficient reason to suspend permission to take drawings.* Circumstances over which human agency can have no control, have de- layed the catalogue, but we should be thankful that the book is open at the College, and if the facts are not accessible in 'written documents, they are recorded in the memory of the excel- lent and indefatigable conservator, who with unwearied patience and unparalleled candour, unfolds the pages of this immense volume, and reads, line by line, to his numerous visitors. Were it the wish of the Court to withhold in- formation regarding this splendid collection, it could not have been more unfortunate in the choice of a superintendant. The appoint- ment of Mr. Clift, and the estimation in which he is held, are of themselves unequivocal proofs that it was the wish of the Court to in- vite and to reward inquiry. * The great improvements lately made in the art of Litho- graphic Drawing, and the comparatively small expence at which it is effected, leads us to hope that much good may be done in this way.

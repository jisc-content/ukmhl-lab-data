26 is requisite in the application of what we acquire to the distinction of diseases which bear close analogies; in the skilful adaptation of our resources to guide a painful and peril- ous malady to a happy termination. We find here a topic which binds us closely in society. The powers of the mind are very limited :—Life is short. The science of alle- viating human suffering, is very comprehensive — and hitherto many of the afflictions incident to mankind, are beyond the power of human skill to remove—yes, even to allay. Under considerations so momentous, what ought we to do ? Will it avail us any thing to spend our time in reproaching those who preceded us, for not judging more accurately—for not hand- ing down to us clearer views of the nature and management of conditions which have been so afflictive to mankind in all ages ? If we indulge in painfid retrospection; tracing to the time of the " Prince of Physicians," the " divine Hippocrates," and discover, that although so many centuries have intervened, and though the line of agents specially de- voted to these objects, runs through the whole period, yet on many important points little or no advancement has been made; it will profit us nothing to indulge in the spirit of animad- version ; nor would the exposure of their de- ficiencies lessen our own responsibility. ]f,

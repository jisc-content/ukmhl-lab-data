11 world, for her intellectual light and moral feeling-, it is deeply to be lamented that she retains among her enactments some statutes and tests affecting offices, seats of learning, and other national privileges, which disgrace an enlightened community, and which will not be abolished till they have ceased to be asso- ciated with the early recollections of old and tenacious men, high in office, mighty in power, and selfish in principle.â€”Even then, another generation might spring up, inheriting the same prejudices, which " growing with their growth, and strengthening with their strength," form again almost a necessary part of the existence of hoary age. It has often been found more easy to subvert a country, than to dethrone a prepossession. It cannot be effected by prying into abuses and exag- gerating their nature; nor by sarcasm and ridicule; nor by the subversion of governing laws. An attempt to violate these powerful principles will only rivet afresh the chains of those who engage in the attack; and perhaps may afford a pretext for the erection of some new defences as a security against a future assailant. But passive obedience is not the only alternative to which we are reduced, for many rightful claims, though long withheld, must ultimately be conceded to persevering and conciliatory application.

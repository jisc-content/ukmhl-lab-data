32 the members not only have access themselves but can introduce their friends; and at other periods they can obtain admission by only soliciting that favor from one of the curators. Those who will take the trouble to consider the nature of the museum, especially those who are acquainted with the damage anato- mical preparations sustain from dust and hand- ling, will be satisfied that there could not be indiscriminate admission without detriment to those specimens, at least, that do not admit of being defended by glass. Besides, it is well known, and it is no slight disgrace to our national character, that Englishmen have such a propensity to injure wantonly, when ad- mitted to public institutions, that promiscuous access could not be allowed without making an unlimited demand on the time of the officers. For purposes of mere inspection then, surely the museum is sufficiently accessible ; and I be- lieve it is a fact, that those who have been loudest in their complaints, have been amongst the most infrequent of the visitors. If it be true that persons have been refused permission to take drawings from the spe- cimens, I have little doubt but that a satis- factory reason would be assigned, if we take the trouble to inquire. Where there is an effort to make a strong case, we should be very cautious how we admit ex parte statements.

12 Policy, however, suggests a variety of ex- pedients likely to hasten iis to a successful issue. Daily observation must teach us the propriety of not irritating the party in power. Firm and continued efforts, combined with the exercise of due respect, should alone be em- ployed. We have no warrant to infer that a party controlled by prejudices detrimental to the interests of society, is not entitled to the most , respectful consideration. It is respect paid to a frailty, which attaches more or less to human nature, and its powerful influence on some topics, is not incompatible with the existence of peculiar excellencies on others. In more advanced stages of human intellect, it is probable that we shall not have to combat principles so restrictive as those we now often meet with, and cannot but perceive operating on our own minds. Some deference is due to early associations. If we look into the history of a few centuries, we shall be surprised to see how very slowly expanded and liberal senti- ments have been developed. More has been effected within the last twenty years, than during the previous century, and is attribu- table, in a very great degree, to means already alluded to, that have happily amalgamated subordinate differences of opinion, by which even well-disposed men had long been kept shy of each other.

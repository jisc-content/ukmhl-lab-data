Here anatomy can be taught not only in lectures, but practically in dissectionsâ€” combined with morbid anatomy, as elucidated in specimens and examinations; and also, com- parative anatomy. Surgery can likewise be delineated in its principles and practice. It is no slight advantage to the student, that from cases under treatment in the hospitals, he can derive the best elucidation of the theory of surgery, so that theory and practice may be combined. Although in general practice a much greater number of medical cases is seen, than of those which are strictly surgical, yet much less interest is generally taken in medical studies, than in those which are sur- gical. This may, perhaps, easily be accounted for. Much of the surgery in hospitals con^ sists of important cases demanding operations, and there is an eclat about an operation which does not arise from the treatment of a case of fever or of internal inflammation, though, per- haps, the skill displayed may be much greater in the latter instances, than in the former. But where clinical medical lectures are given, or where the theory of disease is associated with its appearance in the patient, an interest is excited which cannot be imparted by an ab- stract discussion.

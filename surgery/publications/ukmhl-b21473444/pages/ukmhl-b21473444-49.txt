47 for the science, an individual may familiarize himself with all that has been known in rela- tion to the subject without difficulty. But there are, as in all other departments of na- tural history, depths to which the human mind has never penetrated, and on the unfolding of which, knowledge of vast importance may depend. It is, therefore, still a field of re- search, and extensive know^ledge is requisite before a man can hope to direct his inquiries successfully in the development of intricate parts of the science. The faculty of teaching is distinct from that of acquiring anatomy, though they are sometimes happily united. Many a good anatomist has been deficient in the power of describing with perspicuity, and individuals not excelling in other qualities, have had remarkable facilities of imparting know- ledge to the pupil.

The structure of bone and the general configura- tion of the skeleton, afford ample scope for pleasing and useful contemplation.

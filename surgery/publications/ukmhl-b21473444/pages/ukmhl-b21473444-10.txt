8 In proportion to the light imparted to the mind by education, we usually find a desire for higher attainments in knowledge excited ; but it does not necessarily follow that com- mensurate exertions in patient and persevering study ensue. In the present day, learning is highly appreciated, and peculiar facilities are afforded; but these easy steps have a tendency, unless much care be taken, to supersede those laborious mental exertions on which the form- ation of a powerful character depends. A man of superficial reading, and diligent in his attendance on lectures, may accumulate exten- sive information. He may indeed familiarize himself with every thing that the most able preceptors teach ; but if he habitually neglect that discipline of the mind on which the suc- cessful cultivation of science and its applica- tion to practical purposes really depend, he will be a very incompetent judge of the labors which some of his predecessors underwent in ascending the rugged, and, in many respects, unbeaten acclivity, and in securing for him the privileges he enjoys. Having been raised to a considerable eminence, he becomes a disputant for new facilities, without either disposition or ability to avail himself of his advantages, and to commence, in hfs turn, an explorer of new heights, a smoother of new difficulties in the attainment of knowledge.

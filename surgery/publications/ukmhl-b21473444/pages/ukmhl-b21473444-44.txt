42 discharge of duty, or incur the imputation of being actuated by a selfish motive : and many good and upright men, holding such unworthy motives in the utmost detestation, have not firmness enough to express and perform what may appear to them perfectly correct, lest their intentions should be suspected. In the year 1824, the Court came to the resolution of excluding testimonials of at- tendance on summer courses of lectures on anatomy; and also, to restrict private teach- ing, they resolved to exclude the certificates of lecturers unconnected with certain specified hospitals, or with private schools then in ex- istence. Most of the Court being hospital surgeons, it must be supposed that, from early habits and present associations, they would entertain a predilection in favor of those esta- blishments ; and it has been insinuated that they have allowed themselves to be governed by this feeling. I will not stay to rebut an imputation, equally unworthy of those who make it, as those who made the law are above the conduct laid to their charge. Still, how- ever, it is an important point; and laying aside the motive, we may be allowed to en- quire whether it is the likeliest means to secure the most efficient education, and the most extensive and intimate knowledge of anatomy and surgery.

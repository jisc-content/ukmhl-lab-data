24 MEMORIALS OF before the Mayor, and were accepted and sworn upon the Holy Gospels of God over all the barbers practising the faculty of surgery, and dwelling within the City. They took further oath well and faithfully to oversee and superintend their brethren, to keep the rules and ordinances of the craft, to spare no one for love, favour, lucre, or hate; diligently and without concealment to present to the Chamberlain of the City all faults which they might detect. At all times when called upon so to do to superintend, as in duty bound, all wounds, bruises, maims, and other ills, without asking aught for their trouble. Finally, to do all other things which cc are fit and proper for masters or overseers to perform ;"1 in good sooth a comprehensive oath. Fauconer's ordinance, however, does not seem to have been more effectual than that of Merlawe. In a very short time after this arrangement had been made it is noted that the barber-surgeons " pretending that they were wiser than the overseeing masters," refused to call them to consultation. This may not improbably have been a fact, as it is not unreasonable to believe that the impressment of surgeons for the war which Henry Y. was waging in France2 not only included surgeons, but also those barber-surgeons who had at- tained to any repute for their skill. Those who had escaped the pressgang would, from their scarcity, be held in high esteem by the neighbours requiring their ser- vices. They would thus be liable to exaggerate their own importance, and set the overseeing masters at defiance. 1 Letter Book I, fol. 149&. 2 See page 47.

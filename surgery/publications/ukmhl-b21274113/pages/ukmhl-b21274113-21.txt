xvii PREFACE. the Eecord office, all that could be gleaned relating to surgeons and their practice of surgery. It is of this period of his life that Mr. South writes in a letter dated Sept. 11th, 1868: "I . . . .pay visits daily to the Record office, and read no end of useless things in hope of finding something to my purpose." 1 In regard to the City records, Mr. South appears to have worked independently of the late Mr. Riley, as I find no mention of the latter author's name ; and the translations of the earlier notices of the Barbers and Barber-Surgeons differ in many important respects from the versions given by Mr. Riley in the " Memorials of London and London Life." I am the more surprised at this, as from the date of the above letter Mr. South and Mr. Riley must have been working at the Gruildhall almost contemporaneously. In editing the following pages from the vast mass of material left by Mr. South, I found that the first two chapters had been finished, and were apparently ready for the press. They are therefore printed almost as they stood, and Mr. South must be held answerable for the opinions expressed as to the scientific knowledge possessed by the Druids and their immediate successors. For the rest, I have followed as closely as possible upon the lines which Mr. South had laid down for his own guidance, though I have not hesitated to deviate from them when by so doing it has been possible to give greater effect to the work, or to render it more interesting 1 " Memorials of John Flint South," collected by the Rev.

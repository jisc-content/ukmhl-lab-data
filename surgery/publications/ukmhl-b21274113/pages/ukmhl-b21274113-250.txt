MEMORIALS OF 208 before God doth take mee out of this World. And soe I do here now heartily pray to God for your health and Union together in love and friendship." The request of the old man was granted, and we may hope that his end was peace. The Company, however, were spared the indignity Mr. Arris. of selling their plate, owing to the liber- ality of one of their number, Mr Alderman Arris. The name of this worthy member is still com- memorated in the Arris lecture at the College of Surgeons, founded by him for the study of Anatomy, whilst his portrait adorns the walls of the Barbers' Hall. The Alderman advanced of his substance the sum of £214, and the plate remained intact, since the credit of the Company was sufficient to enable them to borrow the £186, which was required to make up the £400. At the following court, therefore, "The Orders made at the last Court were read and confirmed saveing the Order for selling the plate which is adnullated." The plate, however, was hardly yet secure, for the Com- pany had no sooner paid over this large sum than they were again assessed. In May, 1C43, "Whereas this Company is assessed at 811 per weeke for 3 moneths which they are noewayes able to pay In regard wee are so much in debt and that the Hall may be preserved from violence. . . . It is now Ordered that the plate in the Hall that is not guilt plate shalbe by the Master and Wardens delivered over at the best rate to deliver soe much amounting to 96n." This order was actually executed, and the plate was pawned.

The barbers ultimately became im- portunate, for in October 8th, 1545, it is recorded " The barber-surgeons have day over until this day seven night for their olde matter of dyscharge from offices, etc." 1 In 1518 the College of Physicians was founded, fifty-seven years after the granting of the The9ollegeof Charter to the barbers and barber-sur- Physicians- geons by Edward IV., and thirteen years after the acknowledgment of the wardens and fellowship of the craft and mystery of surgeons as a distinct body. In 1522 the physicians' charter was confirmed by Act of Parliament.

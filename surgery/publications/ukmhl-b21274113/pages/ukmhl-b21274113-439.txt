THE CRAFT OF SURGERY. 395 given, I think upon the Bones, cost you upwards of £30 without the expence of subjects or dissection'—That of the succeeding year in 1787 & 88 cost you upwards of £40. There were indeed 6 Lectures given in that year as there were in the succeeding one of 88 & 89, and their expences amounted to £46 and upwards. It would be scarcely credible if it did not appear upon your Books, with what needless Expences, & with what exactions it has been usual for every thing of this kind, to be deducted. In the present year a charge is made of £3 to Men who attend Executions, a mere Imposition; and what is more extraordinary, this allowance is made, at a time, when no Lectures at all have been given. In 178:2 you voted a Crown ^ head to all those Members of the Court of Assistants who should be present at these Lectures by way of encouraging the attendance of others by their own appearance ; so that every Lecture, putting their right of doing this out of the question, would cost the company, if the whole number attended, an additional expence of 5 Guineas to what they had originally done, & what Man of sense would advise the company to be at the expence of 7 or 8 Guineas for each Lecture unless the Lectures were given on the most useful subjects in Surgery, and delivered by Gentlemen of the first experience in the profession. I know it will be said that our Hall can never be a School of Anatomy the situation of the different Hospitals, the extent of the Town, together with its interference with private courses prohibit it. I admit this mode of reasoning to be in most respects true, but there is a time of the year, in May & June, when the Anatomical Lectures should be over, & before the Students have left the Town, when a number not exceeding 15 Lectures in Surgery might be given gratis by Men of Experience in the profession, on those points which tend only to real practice and the establishment of good principles. Lectures so conducted could not fail of being highly useful to the Students as well as being honourable to ourselves.

52 MEMORIALS OF of the Council to see that the various recommendations therein contained are duly executed, but there is no evidence that any further steps were taken by the authorities in reference to the unlicensed practice of physic. It may therefore be assumed that the physicians took the matter into their own hands, Conjoint ph^cmnsand associating themselves for this purpose into a society which was to co-operate with the pre-existing fellowship of surgeons. The conjoint college thus consisted of physicians and surgeons, each to be independent of the other as to their rights and pri- vileges. The physicians appointed for their government two surveyors of physic to correspond with the two masters of the surgeons. The entire college, however, was under the control of a common head, bearing the title of Eector of Medicines. This officer was to be president or ruler of each of the associated bodies. It seems, however, that he was only to have been appointed occasionally as a dictator when there was urgent need for a common government. To bring the association more prominently into notice it was proposed to acquire an authorised place of resort for its members. With this purpose in view the City authorities were asked to assign to the community three houses situated within the City of London: one, to be furnished and desked for readings and disputations in philosophy and medi- cine, and to serve as a common hall; a second, for the congregations, elections, and consultations of the phy- sicians ; and the third for similar use by the surgeons.

THE CRAFT OF SURGERY. 99 can it be decided on what grounds the Surgeons' Company speak of Henry presenting a charter to their predecessors in 15 3 5. The Act of Parliament was passed in 1540, but there is no allusion in the preamble to the Charter having been granted so long before. The king, too, did not often visit his palace of Bridewell after the trial of Queen Catherine and his marriage with Anne Boleyn; both of which events took place in 1533. If Sanders' conjecture be correct, therefore, and the Charter was really granted in Bridewell, the date of its presenta- tion must have been previous to 1535, unless, indeed, this palace was used as a place for state pageants. The position of Thomas Yicary, too, is suggestive that the actual date of the event is not the one usually assigned. He was master of the Barbers' Company in 1531, and of the united crafts in 1542, as well as on several subsequent occasions. From his actually receiving the document from the hands of the king it is most probable that he was master for the year, and the date must therefore be assigned to one of these two years, and I am inclined to believe that it was in 1542, and that the event commemo- rated was not the granting of a charter, but the final delivery of the Act of Parliament into the hands of the new Company. It is possible, however, that the painting is merely commemorative, the separate studies being incorrectly pieced together after Holbein's death. To return to the Act, however, the intention of the union was " that by the often assembling together, the good and due order exercise and surgeons' in- Â° corporation. knowledge of the said science or faculty of h 2

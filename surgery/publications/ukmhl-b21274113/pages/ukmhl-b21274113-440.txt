98 MEMORIALS OF Were the Gentlemen to give up their insignificant Fees on this occasion or to confine them altogether to the usual one of half a Guinea to be given to the Master and Wardens only, who should be under the necessity of being present at such Lectures, it would I think sufficiently answer the intended purposes. And as an incitement to emulation it would be advis- able for the Compy to give every year a Gold Medal of the same value as that which is presented to your professor, to any Student who should produce the best Treatise in the Judgment of the majority of the Court of Examiners on any given subject.

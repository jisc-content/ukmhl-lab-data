viii MEMORIALS OF THE CRAFT OF SURGERY. arranged, as they have been by Mr. D'Arcy Power, would be a valuable contribution to a part of the history of Surgery in England. Many of them, indeed, may have a wider value, in that they minutely relate facts which may help the general historians of our country to estimate the methods by, and the measure in, which social progress has been influenced, not by the prominent few who are the heroes of our history, but by the constant impetus of the mental powers and the ambitions of the commonalty. Surgeons and students of surgery may certainly find in these Memorials many facts of great interest, and, I think, some useful lessons. Only, let it be borne in mind that they are not full records of the progress of surgery in the present usual meaning of the words. They do not tell much of its progress as either a science or an art, though they may help to the understanding of this part of its history if read together with the writings of the successively con- temporary surgeons. They are, properly, as the title says, " Memorials of the Craft of Surgery," that is, of its business and of the corporate life and government of those who, in successive centuries, practised it. We can trace in them, especially in the last century, an earnest desire for the promotion of surgical knowledge ; but, generally, they record events which were of personal or corporate interest; they tell of the acquirement and defence of civil rights, the main- tenance of dignity and discipline, the repression of rivalry, the settlement of disputes.

These very reverend physicians had received their education at Salernum, and derived much of their medical knowledge from the writings of Ehazes, Avicenna, Avenzoar, and other Arabian writers whose works had been translated into Latin at an earlier date by Constantine, a monk of Mount Casino, near Salernum.

MEMORIALS OF 74 and laid before Nicholas Wifold, the Mayor, and the Aldermen of the City, a certain Bill or suppli- cation." 1 An important epoch in the history of the English barbers was now at hand. Those members of the guild to whom such frequent reference has been made as practisers of surgery^ either improved their surgical attainments, or, as is the more likely, sided with the popular party according to the wont of the citizens of London. For in the first year of the reign of Edward IV., the people's favourite, they received a charter granted to them no doubt as one of the rewards which were showered on the City in return for the readiness with which the citizens had espoused his cause, and for the acclamations with which they had received him after the battle at Mortimer's Cross. The charter was granted on Eeb. 24, 1462, before Edward was firmly established on his newly won throne, and whilst he was yet a friend of the Aldermen. Ostensibly the charter was granted to the barbers as a class, but ostensibly only, for the shavers and the trimmers of beards are passed over in silence as if the " Barbitonsor " was to exist in name only, whilst his place was taken by the modest barber-surgeon. Both surgeons and barbers had been licensed, as we have seen, by the City, though till this date they had neither of them obtained a royal charter. The barbers, as appears from their records and from a journal kept in the office of the Town Clerk of the City of London, were a guild in the second 1 Letter Book K, fol. 250.

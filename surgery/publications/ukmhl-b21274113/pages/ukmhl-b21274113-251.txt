THE GRAFT OF SURGERY. 209 In the autumn of 1643, the Company, apparently driven to desperation by repeated assess- Bankruptcyof ments, deliberately declared themselves the Company' bankrupt in the following terms: " This Court being sensible of those vast Debts they are involved in Doe desire that a Certificate be drawne up of our Debts and the House Seale passed beyond its ability and creditt and therefore not able to lend and soe to be delivered unto the Lord Maior." And yet, as the very next entry at the same court shows, they had money in hand, for, " Whereas there is 40n per annum gathered of the ffreemen of this Com- pany to be adventured into Ireland this Court is willing and doe Order that the said moneyes soe collected shal be made up [to] 5011 and by way of adventure that 50u shalbe payd into the Committee at Grocers Hall haveing formerly adventured 50n." The speculation appears to have been a successful one, for the Company still pos- sess and derive a small part of their revenue from estates in Ireland, and to this day a map of their possessions in that country is suspended in the ante- room to their hall. The seal, too, was not passed wholly beyond its credit, for in November, 1643, " the Master and Wardens may take up One hundred pounds at Interest upon the common seale of this Company for the paying of interest money and dischargeing other necessary payments." In this little matter the Company were accommodated, as appears from a subsequent entry, by " Eobert Whitchurch Citizen and Butcher of London." o

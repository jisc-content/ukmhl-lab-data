EDITOR'S PREFACE. After the death of Mr. South in 1882, Mrs. South sent to the Eoyal College of Surgeons the various manuscripts which her husband had laboriously collected during the last ten years of his life. These papers were examined by Sir James Paget, who considered them worthy to be classified with a view to their subsequent publication. He asked me to undertake this work, and the result appears in the following pages. So far as the present Memorials are concerned, I found that in the first quarter of the present century Mr. Carwardine, to whom we owe the discovery and preservation of the original midwifery forceps manu- factured by the Chamberlens, had projected a history of surgery in England. From inability to obtain access to the Barbers' records, however, he was compelled to desist. Many years subsequently his manuscript appears to have fallen into the hands of Mr. South, and it pro- bably suggested to him the idea of carrying out Mr. Carwardine's design. Mr. South entitled his work " Historical researches into the rise and progress of surgery in England, illustrated by a review of our early medical literature." In pursuance of this design the outline was slightly sketched in as far as the year 1450, an epoch here and there being more fully worked out.

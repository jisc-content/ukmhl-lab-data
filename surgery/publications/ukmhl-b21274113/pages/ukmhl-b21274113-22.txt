xviii MEMORIALS OF THE GRAFT OF 8URGERY. to the general reader. For this purpose, I have made numerous extracts from the Court Minute Books of the Barbers and Surgeons' Company in regard to matters which, though not strictly relevant to the issue, ap- peared to be of too great interest, as illustrating the manners of the age, to be passed over in silence. These extracts I have copied out verbatim et literatim, only writing in full the contractions, and marking the omitted letters by italics. I have throughout' followed Mr. Eiley 1 in using the word " craft " or " trade " as a translation of " mestera " or "mestier." For, as Mr. Eiley points out, " the word ' mystery,' or its old- fashioned and now obsolete form ' mistery,' as signifying a trade, . . . . is in no way connected with ' mysterium/ a 1 secret' which the use of the misguiding English word ' mystery' as its representative might easily lead the purely English reader to suppose." In the translations of the older ordinances, of which the originals are written in abbreviated Latin or Norman- French, I have been careful to compare Mr. South's rendering with that of Mr. Eiley. The history of the Barbers and Surgeons is through- out the history of the development of a guild into a company. In the years succeeding the Norman Conquest, the government of the City of London was oligarchical. The aldermen were the hereditary gover- nors, and their wards belonged to them by right of purchase.

Vain hope, when the whole nation was ablaze with civil war ! Poor Mr. Watson (" auncient master of out Com- pany," as he is styled) fared but badly in these times, for the M^aster and Wardens were required to pay to the Committee the money acknowledged at the last Court of Assistants to be due to Mr Watson " being adjudged to be a Papist and a delinquent to the State." " This Court findeth that they are altogether unable to pay the same money unlesse the money by them disbursed to the publique be repay d."

This Court doth consent That the 400h may with all possible speed be raised and that the Seale may passe for payment of the said 100h 2 yeares hence as is Demanded." To obtain this money, " the Court did pawne all the Companyes plate both guilt and white weighing 1120oz ^-dwt or thereabouts

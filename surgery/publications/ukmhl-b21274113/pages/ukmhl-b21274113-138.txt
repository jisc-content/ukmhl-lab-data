MEMORIALS OF 96 in the possession of the Eoyal College of Surgeons in Lincoln's Inn Fields. The cartoon hangs against the j library wall on the staircase of the college. It is placed at a considerable height, and the light falls upon! it in such a manner as to render a close scrutiny of it almost impossible. I have, however, recently made a somewhat careful examination of it. The principal por-! traits bear testimony to the masterly hand of Holbein. |i The back row of figures on the left of the king are evi-J dently by an inferior artist, as they bear no resemblance to those of the finished picture in Monkwell Street,! some of the heads being quite grotesque, and more like caricatures than the faithful portraits of Holbein. Van Mander, and more recently Mr. Cunlett, state that Hoi- bein expired without finishing the' panel in the possession of the Barbers' Company, and Mr. Black has shown that he died somewhat suddenly of the plague in the parish j of St. Andrew Undershaft in the year 1543. The' cartoon, moreover, is shorn of its fair proportions, being curtailed at each end so that it only measures nine feet two inches across, thereby docking off Master Alsop on the right, and Richard Ferris with the nameless onej above him towards the extreme left of the king. It differs also from the panel in the colour of the drapery, i The portraits are taken upon four pieces of paper which j are joined together upon a canvas to form the picture. Saunders,1 in confirmation of this view, states that the "portraits are separate pieces of paper pasted in their J. proper places and are evidently the original studies 1 Knight's " London," vol. iii. p. 182.

THE GRAFT OF SURGERY. 131 these two surgeons may be compared with those of John of Arderne, Jiving two hundred and fifty years pre- viously, whom we have already quoted in a previous chapter.

Muste first seme God, forsee the ende, bee clenly, pitie the poore. " ii. Must not be suborned for money, to hurt man- kinde. 1" A Dialogue betwene Sornes and Ohyrurgi," fol. viii.j J 2

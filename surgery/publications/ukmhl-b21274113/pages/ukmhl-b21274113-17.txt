The surgeons were not allowed to practise shaving ; the barber-surgeons were not allowed to do more than draw teeth; and if any of them became surgeons it was after such educa- tion as, in some measure at least, fitted them for surgical practice. This division of the Company was maintained by every rule and custom. The surgeons were constantly asserting their superiority in all things relating to anatomy or surgery; they resisted all encroachments from the barbers' side; they resisted the control of the physicians, and gradually superseded them as teachers of anatomy in their own hall; and, when any one was to be admitted into the joint Company who had not been apprenticed to any of its members, it was only as a barber that he could be admitted. At last, as the surgeons became more skilled and influential, and surgery became a science as well as an art, even the appearance of the union became intoler- able ; and although the barbers were an influential body of citizens in various lines of business, and had always, as they said, " with the greatest deference, submitted to the surgeons in all matters peculiar to them," yet the surgeons insisted on separation. They gave up all claim to any share in the property or other treasures of the Company, and obtained for themselves the separate Charter which preceded that by which their successors are incorporated in the Eoyal College.

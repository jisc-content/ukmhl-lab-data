MEMORIALS OF THE CRAFT OF SURGERY. 29 1367, whilst John was a young doctor of physic in 1320. It would be interesting to imagine that the poet and the physician had met; in any case, however, the reputation of Gaddesden had reached the author of the Canterbury Tales, who thus mentions him in his Prologue1 amongst the classical authors of medicine in describing the learning of his doctor of physic : " Wei knew he the olcle Esculapius, And Deiscorides and eek Rufus; Old Ypo-cras, Haly, and Galien ; Serapyon, Razis, and Avycen ; Averrois, Damascien, and Constantyn ; Bernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn." The work by which Gaddesden became celebrated is the " Rosa Anglica," in which he treats of fevers and injuries of all parts of the body, of hygiene, dietetics, and materia medica. It became a text-book of medicine throughout Europe. Although drawn largely from previous writers, it is illustrated by the author's own practice, and is interesting as a register of the medical and surgical knowledge of the time at which it was written. Such knowledge however, had not advanced far if we may judge by the author's well-known recommendation that a patient suffering from small- pox should be wrapped in scarlet or some other red cloth, " as," says he, " when the son of the illustrious king of England (Edward II.) had the small-pox, for I took care that everything about his couch should be red, and his cure was perfectly effected, for he was restored to health without a trace of the disease."

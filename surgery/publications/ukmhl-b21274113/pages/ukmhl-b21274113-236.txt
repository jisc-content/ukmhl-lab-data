MEMORIALS OF 194 Surgery unlesse such Surgeon at such tyme shall have his letter of admittance from this company under the Common seale of the same testifieing his admision to p>ractize Surgery, uppon payne to forfyt his [i.e. the examiner's] places and degree in this Company." The ceremony of presentation to the bishop appears to have borne the same relation to the Company's examination as the formal graduation in the older universities bears to the public examinations, and it was necessary to render valid the surgeon's licence to practise. Thus " Eoger Jenkins heretofore examined and approved in the Arte of Surgery was presented before the Deane of Pawles and his letters of admittance from the said Deane " were read. And at the same time Abraham Allen was lykewyse admitted by the said Deane." The Company was a mystery,1 in the more recent The company sense of the word, for " Mawris David ap- peared before the M.asteis and was rebuked for shewinge the copie of o^r Charter to a scriv- ener." In 1606 a special ordinance was made, " ffor avoydinge of giuf^g Controversy and debate in this Company. It is ordered by this Court that if any Assistant of this Company shall malitiously or otherwise at any tyme hereafter reveale report or publysh to any person being not an Assistant of this Company any sensure, order or decree . ... of this Company .... whereby any person sensured or ordered may be ympeached or hurt in his name or creditt," he shall be fined. 1 See Editor's Preface.

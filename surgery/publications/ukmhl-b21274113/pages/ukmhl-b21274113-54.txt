MEMORIALS OF 18 uprightly in all other things belonging to their calling."1 The next admission of Master Surgeons is dated 1389, and although nearly identical in form with the preceding, it presents two points of interest. In the first place there is a distinct recognition of the practice of women; and secondly, amongst the Master Surgeons I admitted is the name of Master John Hynstok. The practice of medicine by the opposite sex was not of recent date, since there were several women whose writings were held in high esteem at Salernum, as early as the eleventh century. Dr. William Moore,2 of Dublin, has shown that in the Irish Guild of Barber-Surgeons, founded in 1446, women are recog- nised as distinctly sharing in the privileges of the j foundation. The name of Master Hyndstoke is re- j corded in the previous admission twenty years earlier. The John Hynstok here mentioned may be either the same person or a relative. If the two are identical it would give weight to the supposition that the persons admitted as Magistri Surgici were not merely Master Surgeons, but were actually Masters or Alder- j men of the Surgeons' Guild, and were thus publicly placed in authority over their brethren. Office bearers | of this kind will by-and-by be found to be actually! in many instances without being needed by the context, but rather as a j sort of saving clause to cover any omission that might possibly have been made. 1 Letter Book G, fol. 219.

MEMORIALS OF 128 The surgeons of his time must of necessity have been ignorant, for even the few and instructed surgeons can only have been taught by the very small number of those who were acquainted with Latin, and who were content to lecture and comment upon the classic writers or of the still smaller number who had improved their book learning by the surgical experience which they had gained in the wars. In the Institution already quoted, Gale gives the following account of the qualifications which he considers necessary for a surgeon. The extract is of interest, as illustrative of the views of a well edu- cated surgeon of the sixteenth century in regard to the position his profession should hold. " Gluido requyreth iiij thinges in hym that is or shoulde be a Chirugian. First, that he shoulde be lettered, secondly, that he shuld be expert, thyrdlye, that he be ingenious, and last, that he be vertuous and well maneryd. . . . And as touchyng theis iiij pointes, note first wher Guido sayth he must be lettered, he doth meane he shoulde be lerned, and that chefelye in suche doctrine as is in his art requisite. That is at the lest, that he can wright, red, and understande the mynde of latyne authour. If he had knowledge in geometrie for makynge his incision, for curynge fractures and luxa- tions, and also in curiuge malignant ulcers ; knowynge what figure would moste spedely unite, and Ioyne the lyppes of the ulcere; it ware very commendable. Naturall Philosophic is a goodlye ornature to the Chirurgian, for it showeth hym what resulteth whan as there is diuers and sondry simples mixed to gether.

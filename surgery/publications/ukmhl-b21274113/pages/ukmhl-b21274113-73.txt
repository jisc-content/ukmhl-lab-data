And at london he deceyued many men. And when he mi3t no3t cure som man he made suggestion to tham that no man mi3t cure tham and that affermed he with swering that 3if the fistule was dried that the pacient at the next schuld no3t eschape dethe whiche forso^ ylefte and forsake of hym I cured perfltely. And to remoue false opinions of ignorant men for witnes I putte ex- perience. Avicen fovsofk seith experience ouercomeM reson and Galien in pantegniis2, seith no man ow for to trust in reson aloon but 3if4 it be proued of ex- perience.

MEMORIALS OF 176 distressed Netherlander who were in their palmy days such masters of the art of pageant making seems to have fallen upon our citizens at this time. And as if to heighten the gaiety of the scene, the next precept tells of death and disease, and that as in life so in the reigns of princes, " Optima quseque dies miseris mortalibus sevi Prima fugit; subeunt morbi tristisque senectus ; Et labor et durse rapit inclementia mortis." 1 (( Whereas I and my Brethren the alderm<?^ duly con- The sideringe ourselves the present infecczon of the Plague. p}agVe amongst us so greatlie dispersed in all partes of this Cittie liberties and Suburbs and the greate multitude of poore people wMch by reason of the said in- fecc/on have theire howses shut vpp and restrayned as well from goinge abroad as theire daylie trade and labors wherewzYh theie were accustomed to mayntaine them- selves, theire wives and families, and doe at this^r<?sent by reason thereof endure greate wante and extremities, have thought fitt that all publique ffeasting and common dinners at every the severall Halles and Common meet- ings of corporaczons and Companies wzthin thys Cittie shall duringe the tyme of god's visitac^on amo^ge us be but not finished), the King roade not from the Tower through the Citie in Royall manner, as had been accustomed, neither were the Citizens per- mitted to come at Westminster, but forbidden by Proclamation, for feare of infection to be by that meanes increased, for there dyed that weeke in the City of London and suburbs of all diseases 1,103; of the plague, 857." This was the plague of 1603. It went on increasing year by year until its virulence culminated in 1609, a year in which 4,000 were said to have died in London alone. It broke out again in 1625, in 1636, and finally in the great plague of 1665. (See Loftie's " History of London," vol. i. p. 355; ed. 2.) 1 Virg., Georg., iii. 66.

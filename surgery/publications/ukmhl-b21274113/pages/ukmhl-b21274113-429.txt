They met in July to examine the Accounts of their Officers of the preceeding year, whose Duties terminated in the beginning of the same month; sometimes earlier in the month, sometimes later. Within a short space of time they deferred this Report till August & soon afterwards till September ; at length it was deferred till the February & March of the succeeding year & i sometimes later, & this Order, if it can be so called was observed ' till the Resolutions of 1778. There were amongst others, two considerable defects in this S plan.

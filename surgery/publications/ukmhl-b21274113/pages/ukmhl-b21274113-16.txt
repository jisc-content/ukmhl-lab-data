And this evidence of their station is confirmed by the fact that, like the physicians, the surgeons then, and for a long time afterwards, were licensed to practise by the Bishop of London or the Dean of St. Paul's ; for it was, I think, only over the classes deemed learned that the Church had such jurisdiction as these licences imply.

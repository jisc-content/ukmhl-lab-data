THE CRAFT OF SURGERY. those for which they were originally designed will cause a great increase of expence in your furniture, your Coals, your Candles; but what is still more detrimental, the lower part of your House is by this means uninhabited, & I need not observe what damage the whole Building may receive from hence in a short space of time. If your Committee Room is to be converted into an Eating Parlour, why should we not eat in it ourselves ?—Your Dinners at the Tavern are exceedingly inconvenient & expensive & attended with a great loss of time. You meet at the Hall, You adjourn to the Tavern, you return to the Hall again, & all this, when you have a House of your own inhabited - at a great expence to you & where if you have not already all the conveniences you want you may at any time be furnished with them. If Gentlemen, you make no better use of the Hall than what you have already done, you had better sell it, and apply the Money for the good of the Company in some other way. Your Hall has cost you a Sum during the last 4 years very little less than £1,200 & the Bills for repairs, independently of the Taxes and Ground Bent have amounted to upwards of £250 within the last two. I could wish Gentlemen, on this head, that the laying out any Sum of Money beyond 5 or £10 may not be left to a Com- mittee of 2 or 3 as has been usual I believe to the Master and Wardens chiefly—But that a Surveyor should be appointed, who in the Month of March every Year should inspect your Building and report its condition to the Master by whom it should be brought to the Court of Assistants, on the first Thursday in April every Year so that the subsequent General Court held in the beginning of July may be in good time to confirm & direct the immediate execution of such repairs as may be wanting The great business in matters of this kind is not to be led into unnecessary expences from precipitation.

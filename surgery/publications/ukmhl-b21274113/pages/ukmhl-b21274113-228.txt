MEMORIALS OF 186 acted harshly and unjustly towards them, than it had been during the reign of Elizabeth. In the follow- ing case the Company clearly sided with the apprentice, and yet were constrained for the sake of example to up- hold his master : " Whereas it pleased the right honorable the Lord Maior of this Cittie by his order bearinge date the seaventeneth daie of this instant December [1604] to refer the hearinge and endeinge of all controversies betwixt William Wrighte of thone parte and Thomas Marston his apprentice of the other parte to us the Miasters and governoz<!rs of the Misterie and Comminaltie of Barbers and Surgeons of London.

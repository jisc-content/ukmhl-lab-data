263 THE CEAFT OF SURGERY. ' Commons. " Being examined, lie said that he was ap- ' pointed surgeon of his Majesty's ship, the Looe, and ls being in his return home taken prisoner in a merchant i} ship by the French and put into the common prison at Dl (Brest, he petitioned the superintendent of the place to to be removed to an open hospital at Dinan along with the Dt surgeon and his mate of the Northumberland man-of-war. } That he enclosed his warrant from the Navy office in to i his petitionary letter. And some days afterwards in- A quiring of the linguist about the success of his petition, I he was told that the superintendent did not know by Ihis warrant whether he (the witness) was a barber or II a surgeon. That upon desiring the witness to read the 1 warrant over, by which it would appear he was a sur- (' geon, the linguist replied it might be so, but that if the I witness had been taken on board one of the King of : Great Britain's ships, it would have been out of doubt. ^Whereupon the witness, concluding his warrant would l! be of no service to him, made application by another f channel, and was ordered to go in a draught appointed \ some time after." I The barbers were usually present at the four public [lectures of Anatomy, two of which were delivered at the [i! expense of the Company, and the other two at the j; expense of the surgeons. The annual expense incurred ■by the Company on account of these lectures amounted i !to about one hundred guineas, towards the defraying of j which they received the interest of £510, given by Mr. I Alderman Arris for a muscular lecture, and an annuity j of £16 bequeathed by Dr. Grale for an osteological lecture.

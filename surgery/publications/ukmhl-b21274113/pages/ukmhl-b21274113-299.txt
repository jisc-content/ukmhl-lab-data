"The Barbers1 of London were a Fraternity before the Cime of Edward the Second, and by Letters-Patent of Edward the Fourth were made a Body Corporate, and nvested with several Powers and Privileges. In the >2d Year of Henry the Eighth, the ptcblick Policy nought proper to unite them with another Company (not hen incorporated) called the Surgeons of London, in rder, (as is most probable) to transfer those Powers ,nd Privileges to the latter, without directly appearing 0 wrest them from the former to whom they had been riginally granted. " This Coalition of the two Companies having now ubsisted above Two Hundred Years, the Barbers are lurpris'd to find an Attempt made by the Surgeons 1 dissolve it, by Authority of Parliament, without their >articipation or Consent. " The principal Reasons assigned by the Surgeons, in leir printed Case, to induce the Legislature to this vtraordinary Act of Power, are, " First, That the Barbers, in the Time of Henry the Eighth, were all Surgeons, and that the Parliament, y uniting them with others of superior Abilities, itended their Improvement in that Profession ; but Hat they having, long since, ceased to intermeddle with ny Branch of Surgery, this Intent of the Act is frus- *ated, and the laudable Purpose of the Union at an end. 1 Throughout this document the words here printed in italics occur . the original in italics.

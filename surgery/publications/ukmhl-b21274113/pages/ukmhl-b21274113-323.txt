279 THE CRAFT OF SURGERY. Amongst the bodies brought to the theatre for dissection was that of Lord Ferrers, who was executed for the murder of his steward in 1760. In reference to this event the following minute occurs in the books of the Company : " The Master having laid before the Court a Letter he had received from Lady Huntingdon in respect to the treatment of Lord Ferrers body,1 And the same and part of the late Act of Parliament relating to Murderers having been read ... It was resolved that it be left to the Master and Wardens to dispose of the Body of Lord Ferrers. And to give such directions in respect to applying for a Guard and other particulars as they shall think proper." The guard here mentioned was probably for the purpose of keeping order in the hall during the exposure of the body after the execution.2 It does not appear that any dissection was performed upon him, and he was buried in Old St. Pancras Church. During the earlier years of the Company's sepa- rate existence they were constantly disput- .., , ,-, i-ir Tne army and pgr with surgeons who had retired from navy sur- 0 0 geons. the army and navy, and who sought to make practices for themselves without taking the diploma of the Company. The old army surgeons 1 The sheriff, Yaillant, had promised before the execution that the Earl's body should not be stripped. 2 Of this ceremony there still exists a print, lettered " Lord Ferrers, as he lay in his coffin at Surgeons' Hall." It appears that the public were admitted to the hall to view the bodies previous to their dissection, in much the same manner as is common in the Morgue at Paris. Special provisions were made for preventing the undue intrusion of the mob, as may be read in Appendix Q, page 381.

Be this as it may, however, at the next court day " The father of Thomas Marston the Appren- tice of Willmm Wrighte paid to the use of the said Wrighte the somme of ffortie shillinges w/iich the said Wrighte then refused to receive, and also to stand to the order of the Wasters . . . according to a referrence to them by the lord Maior referred. Wherefore it is ordered that for his said Contempt hee be committed to the Compter uppon the Loro7 Maior's command." This committal appears to have brought him to his senses, for at the next court, " according to a former order Wilh'am Wrighte hath deliuered upp to our Master the Indenture of Thomas Marston his ap- prentice . . . whereuppon the Waster paid unto the said Wrighte xls wkich he had receaved of the father of the apprentice." This would have settled the matter in an ordinary case, but Wrighte was litigious, and on the first opportunity he " appeared before the Masters of this Company and required a Coppie of the order betweene him and Thomas Marston his late apprentice. To which the Masters answered That they would be ready to showe that Order when and where they should be called by authoritie." And so the matter ended as far as the Company is concerned, since no further entry occurs in the minute books either about Wrighte or Marston, who, we will hope, went their respective ways in peace, and ceased from troubling each other.

398 MEMORIALS OF But this plan was never likely to be well executed : 1st because no adequate reward was provided for the Professor.— £diy Because a Condition was annexed which was of itself suffi- cient to destroy the whole. The Condition was as follows : Viz1, That these Lectures should be so read, at such times, within the above mentioned period, as the Master & Wardens for the time being* shod appoint. This alteration, ostensibly I believe (for it does not appear that the proposed Lectures were read) took place for the present moment; but in the succeeding year of 1767, you determined, (really I believe without taking- the trouble of informing" your- selves of what had passed the year before) that the 12 Lectures as above mentioned (for you forgot the 3 Osteological) should be now varied, for that is the expression, and that such Professor for the time being should be obliged to give (an implication that they had not yet been given) such a number of 6 Lectures on the Muscles, and 6 on the Viscera, as the Master and Wardens for the time being shall from time to time appoint, and so this Business, for all the purposes of efficacy, has been given up, & in that whimsical state at the expiration of another 13 years it now continues ; nor can I find that either the 12 or 15 Lectures have ever in any one year been given.

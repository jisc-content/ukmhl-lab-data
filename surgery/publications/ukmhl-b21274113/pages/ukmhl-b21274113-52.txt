16 MEMORIALS OF surgeons are first noted as a distinct body who, like all other persons following trades and professions, were required to appear before the authorities of the City of London to be by them licensed to practise within their jurisdiction. This licence was conceded under promise " well and truly to serve the people in their cures, to take of them reasonable fees,1 to exercise their mystery faithfully, to report to the Mayor and Aldermen any surgeon neglecting his patients, and to give informa- tion to the City officers of the hurt, wounded, or other- wise in peril of death." The following document is endorsed, "Admission of Master Surgeons." In it the persons who of Master sur- came before the Mayor and Aldermen to geons. J be sworn as Master Surgeons of the City of London are simply termed Surgeons. From this it is doubtful whether these persons only became Masters in Surgery by the authority of the court, after having been previously licensed to practise surgery by the Bishop of London or the Dean of St. Paul's, as was the common custom at this time, for the legal practice of the art: or whether they were sworn as Masters of the Guild of Surgery within the City of London having authority over their brethren of the craft. The latter hypothesis seems the more probable, inasmuch as in the 1 The licence to practise surgery granted by the University of Oxford is still very similar; it runs: "Primo, scilicet, quod quatuor saltern pauperes gratis et intuitu caritatis (quumprimum sese occasio tulerit) cures. . . . Secundo, quod fines artis tuse non excedas, aut niedicinam practices. Tertio, quod nimium pro salario non exigas; aut curationem aliquam retardes uberioris lucri intuitu."â€”Stat. Univ. Oxon. 1874; vi. (ix.) vii. 8, p. 151.

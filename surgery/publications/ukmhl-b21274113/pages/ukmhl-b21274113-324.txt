280 MEMORIALS OF sheltered themselves behind an Act passed in the secon year of the reign of George the Second, entitled " A:' Act to enable such officers, mariners, and soldiers a have been in his Majesty's service since his accession t the throne to exercise Trades." In 1782 the matte was set at rest by the Company stating a case for th; I consideration of the law officers of the Crown, wta decided against them. The examination of surgeons for the army an( navy long continued an integral part of the functions o the Company, and in its capacity of examiners for th* services two persons of note came before it. The one in real life, was unsuccessful; the other, in fiction, wa; happier. " Oliver Goldsmith presented himself in ; new suit (not paid for) to be examined as to hh qualifications for being a surgeon's mate, on tin 21st December, 1758, and in the minutes of the Cour of Examiners held on that date the entry occurs James Bernard, mate to an hospital; Oliver Goldsmith found not qualified for ditto." 1 The second and nc less famous person, although non-existent, is Roderick Eandom, who has left us a most interesting and graphic description of what passed at the examination; an account which is the more interesting when we reflecl that his creator, Smollett, had received his qualification as surgeon's mate from the Company, probably aftei undergoing a somewhat similar ordeal.2 1 " Life and Times of Oliver Goldsmith," by J.

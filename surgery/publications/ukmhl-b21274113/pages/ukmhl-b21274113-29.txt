PREFACE. xxv i far larger share of his valuable time than I as a stranger could have claimed, or he need have granted. His help has been invaluable, especially in matters of detail relating to the Barbers' Company; and his answers have in many cases thrown light upon passages which, in my ignorance of City customs, were obscure. I have ?urther to thank Mr. Young for giving me several extracts relating to the Surgeons which he met with in his reperusal of the books belonging to the Barbers' [Company, and which appear to have escaped the notice of Mr. South. To Dr. Norman Moore, the Warden of the College !in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, I must tender my grati- tude for the kindness with which he read the proof- sheets, correcting many minor errors. Mr. Horace Noble has laid me under an obligation iby the care with which he has revised the paragraphs and appendices upon the Company's heraldry, a science of which, I regret to say, I am profoundly ignorant. Mr. Joseph Mills kindly lent me the plate from which the interior of the Barbers and Surgeons' Hall i has been re-engraved. Lastly, Sir James Paget, by the readiness with < which he undertook, at my request, to write the intro- duction, has added a valuable feature to the work, and has rendered it of greater and more permanent value than I could otherwise hope to have made it.

MEMORIALS OF 198 the Commons, for it is recorded, " that trie Masters of this Companie shold proce&e wzth the reneweinge of the Charter of this Company accordinge as they shall thinke fyt, and shold contynnue the articles hereafter expressed or so many of them as it shold please the Lords to whom the same is referred to geve allowance of." The draught charter 1 is interesting, as it affords a picture of the customs of the profession at the beginning of the seventeenth century. It relates almost entirely to the surgical side of the Company, and gives to the surgeons a better position than that which they previously occupied. The clause 2 relating to the idea that " the openinge, searinge and embalminge of the dead corpes [was] properly belonginge to the science of barbery and surgery " is remarkable ; whilst the conclu- sion of the paragraph gives us a curious idea of the under- takers of the period, for it says that " the same is intruded into by Butchers, Taylors, Smythes, chaundlers and others of divers trades unskillful in Barbery or surgery3 and unseemely and unchristianlike defaceing, disfiguringe and dismemberinge the dead corpes so that by their unskill- full searinge and embalming the corpes corrupteth and groweth presently contagious and ofensive to the place and persons approachinge." 1 Appendix L, page 361. 2 Clause xvi. 3 The chandlers appear to have been especially busy in acting as em- balmers, for, " Oct. 26, 1612. This daie it is ordered that at the chardges of the house the presente Masters with the Clark shall seek in the Rowles for the Charter of the wax chaundlers and to tak a coppie of that parte of the Charter touchinge the libertye gyven unto them for the enibalmynge of dead bodyes. And as they shall finde the same soe to tak the advice of my lord chief Justice about the same at the chardge of the house."

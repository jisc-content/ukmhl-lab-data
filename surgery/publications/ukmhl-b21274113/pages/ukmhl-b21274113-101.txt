61 THE GRAFT OF SURGERY. St. Damien's Day (27th Sept.)1 to choose four masters " as old custom was " to rule and govern the craft and to hold the treasure and common goods, to be handed |on by them to the succeeding masters, at the same time giving also an account of the same ; and each of the outgoing and incoming masters was to receive six shil- lings and eightpence at this audit. At every yearly election two of the former masters might be retained, but other two from them were to be elected to make up the full number. But no master after two years' service could be elected for the next coming year " against his will." Every master within ten days of his election was to " be presented and take his charge," under penalty ;"to the box of the craft of thirteen shillings and four- pence," without provable cause, and then another master to be elected by the four men chosen from the fellowship for the same year, who together with the old masters were to present him within ten days or each of them " to spay to the box of the craft three shillings andfourpence." Every surgeon of the fellowship was " to pay yearly twopence a quarter to the box, that is eightpence a year i to the profit and worship of the craft and in helping and relieving the need of the poor men of the same fel- lowship, "to be collected by the masters with one of the four men with them ; " and a book of account was to be kept in which also were to be entered all fines received. 1 Two brothers, who practised as physicians in Cilicia, and were martyred in the early part of the fourth century. They are supposed to II have been the first practitioners who refused fees. For this reason perhaps they were selected as the patron saints of the guild. At a later period St. Luke fulfilled this function. F. Boerner, "De Cosma et Damiano." Helmstadt, 1751.

THE CRAFT OF SURGERY. 401 have put ourselves on the footing of a liberal, of an humane, & learned Society and so beneficial a one to the public, from the proper Exertions of our own private Fund; we shall have a better pretence to ask for an extension of those powers from Parliament, which we have discovered a disposition to execute so much for the advantage of the Community. Resolved that a Committee of Seven Members of this Court be appointed to consider of the above Observations and make their Report thereon to the next Court. Resolved that the Master and Wardens Mr Warner Mr Grindall Mr Minors, & Mr Gunning be of that Committee and that any three of them do make a Quorum, And that such Committee do meet for the first time on Tuesday next the 6th instant at 6 o'Clock in the Evening, and that such Committee be paid the usual ffee of half a Guinea for each attendance. This being the Day appointed by the Act of Parliament for the choice of a Master and Wardens for the ensuing year the Court proceeded to elect a Master; And Chas Hawkins Esqr one of His Majesty's Principal Serjt Surgeons was in conformity to the Bye Laws [declared] to be unanimously chosen Master for the year ensuing.

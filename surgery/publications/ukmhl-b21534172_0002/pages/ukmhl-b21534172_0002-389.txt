/ SURGERY. 381 1434. Extenfion attempted previoufly to the accedion of fwelling (772.), and con- cretion (1430.), is moft likely to be fucceff- ful, and fubfervient to repofition (1431.) of a luxated, bone. 1435. It may often be neceflfary to aug- ment the exertion of the furgeon (96.) and his affiftants by the mechanical pow- ers the lever and the pully, and to apply them fo as to occafionally elevate and fufpend the patient by repeated and fud- den jerks *. 1436. Extenfion (1432.) duly perform- ed, the luxated bone refumes its health- * The famous Ambe of Hippocrates is a lever fup- ported by a peculiar fulcrum : This inftrument has been varioufly improved by M. Freck, &c. I have combined the ambe conftrufted upon the belt principle, and an axis in peritrochio, fo as to be capable to produce the moft regular forceful exten- fion, and, when requilite, the elevating jerk, with- out the afliltance of any other apparatus. After a luxation had endured thirteen weeks, and the patient had been fubje&ed to a great variety of furgery, particularly had been repeatedly hoifted, I performed repofition of the arm-bone (os humeri) by the aid of what I call the foot-lever} in uling which the furgeon needs no afliftance.

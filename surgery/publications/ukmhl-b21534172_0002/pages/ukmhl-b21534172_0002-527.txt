SURGERY. $1$ 1723. 2.

Deligation.—Little difficulty attends the flaying of haemorrhage after arteriotomy (1720.) juftly performed in the temporal artery. Deligation fpecified after phlebotomy (1710.) being found in- adequate, affiftance may be derived from the tournequet (1637.) *. 1725. Arguments adduced to evince, that, peculiar advantages refult from ab- ftradlion of blood from the arterial fyftem (22.), are by no means conclufive. Ar- teriotomy (1720.) is therefore very feldora pradlifed. * Dr Butter has invented a fpecial bandage rcr be ufed after arteriotomy. It is no more than a ilight alteration of Petit’s tournequete. It may be ufefully applied to other parts of the body to reftrain haemor- rhage.

The alimen- tary furface is perhaps not exempted from its invarton (936.). 1094. Of the cutaneous furface, the face is the mod frequent refidence of rofe (1090.). It not feldom inverts the head. The tumefadlion exifts often in fucli quantity as to Ihut the eye-lids, and in them to aflume the fuppurative termi- nation (785.) f. The function of the brain, too frequently, is affedted, and to a fatal degree. f When the rednefs and fwelling in eryfipelas'have proceeded for fome time, there commonly arife, fooner or later, blitters of a larger or fmaller fize on feveral parts of the face. Thelc contain a thin colourlcfs li- quor, which fooner or later runs out. The furface of the (kin, in the bliltered places, fometimes becomes livid and blackilh : but this livor feldom goes deeper than the furface, or difeovers any degree of gangrene afFe&ing the Ikin. On the parts of the face not af- fected with blliters, the cuticle fuffers, towards the end of the difeafe, a conliderable defquamatlon. Sometimes the tumor of the eye lids ends in fuppu- ration.

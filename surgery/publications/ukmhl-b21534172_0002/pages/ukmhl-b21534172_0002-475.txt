SURGERY. 467 2. Rigidity. Symptoms. 1598. Rigidity of the mother’s parts (1591.), particularly of the internal orifice, caufing lingering parturition (1590.), is difcovered by 1. The mother’s being paft the meridian of life, and never having been before in child-bed: 2. The comparatively rcfiftent and un- dilated condition of the parts, although the urgency of the throes (1583.) have been great and continued : 3. The abfence of other caufes. Practice. 1599. Rigidity (1598.) is a caufe of lingering parturition (1590.) much lefs formidable than narrow bafon (1592 ), and generally is furmountable by protra<fl- ed diftenfion, the organs concerned being conftituted to yield gradually, a change that may perhaps be promoted by 1. Blood-letting (116.), when the mother is ftrong and plethoric. 2. Anodynes (119.) in proper form lo- cally applied. 3 N 2

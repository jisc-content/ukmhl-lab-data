494 ELEMENTS of 1655. 2.—FimEl ion after amputation (1652.) —Every point and organ of the fyftem (23.) manifeftly contributing to general function, an encroachment by amputation (1652.) on the found ftrudlure (15-) in- fers wanton and unjuftifiable injury. The ordinary points, in which the extremities are amputated, are, a little above the wrift, elbow, ankle, and knee, and below the el- bow and knee. The diftance may be va- ried according to circumftances: preferving the infertion of the mufcles extending and bending the fore arm and leg is a ufeful meafure, becaufe it prevents derangement that might otherwife enfue. 1656. Solid argument is wanting to evince the impropriety of performing am- putation at or in a joint: fome recent ex- periments have been made refpe&ing this important point, in the fhoulder and hip ones *. * See Mr White’s Cafes in Surgery, p. 57. Mr Kerr, Surgeon of Northampton hofpital, amputated the leg of a girl, in the hip-joint: She died in twelve days ; but this event feems juftly im- putable to other catifes.

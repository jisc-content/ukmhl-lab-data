It appears al leaft from diflections, that the ftomach has often been affeded with inflammation, when neither pain nor pyrexia had given any notice of it; and fuch nve judge to have been of the eryfipelatous kind. This kind of inflammation alfo is efpecially to be expected from acrimony of any kind applied to the ftomach, and would certainly proceed more frequently from fuch a caufe, were not the interior furface of this organ commonly defended by a mucus exfuding in great quantity from the numerous follicles placed imme- diately under the villous coat; on many occafions, the exfudation of mucus is prevented, or the liquid pour- ed out is of a lefs vifeid nature, fo as to be left fitted

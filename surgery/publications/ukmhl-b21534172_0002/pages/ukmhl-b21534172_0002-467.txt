SURGERY. 459 l 1586. Ordinary parturition (1585.) can- not be considered as womb-obftruclion. It is a healthful a&ion, and requires no adiftance from art (1581.). vagina to perceive the membranes and contiguous head (a mode of inveftigarion peculiarly named touch- ing) • circumftances which, connected with a painful fenfation in the facral region, extending to the pubis, and aggravated at intervals, indicate inftant or ap- proaching parturition. By diltenfion chiefly the contradile power of the womb is roufed, which excites the co-operation of that of the refpiratory and abdominal mulcles, by whofe repeated and attoniiliingly forceful nifus or ex- ertions, named labour-pains or throes, the veficular diftended membranes are proportionally comprefled, and protruded through the internal orifice of the womb gradually dilated, fo as to form one common opening with that of the bafon : The child’s head en- tering its brim can be diftinguiflied through the cover- ing membranes by touchi ng; thefe at laff bunting, the liquor amnii is fuddenly effufed : Its crown di- rected downwards and forwards, elevating the exter- nal orifice and perineum in the form of a tumor, emerges from under the ofia pubis; the happy pre- Iude of parturition icon to be completed by the ex- pulfion of its other parts, and of the fecundities: a painful, foinetimes tedious, but fpontaneous procefs, in which the interference of art ought to be regarded as impertinence, not feldom hurtful, 3 M 2

/ 44 ELEMENTS or goes *. This may be analogous very pro- bably to fermentation f. 834. It has been rendered probable, that the red part of the blood (22.) extrava-. * I have already obferved, that the ferum of hu- man blood, upon {landing but a little time in the fur- nace, becomes turbid before it grows offenfive, and then gradually drops a fedimenr refembling di- gejled matter. This experiment was alfo frequently repeated with the fame fuccefs ; and I likewife took notice,, that this matter never changed its colour, or mixed again with the ferum. From thefe circum- ftances I conjeflure, that this fediment is a terreflrial fubitance, intended for the nouriihment or reparation of the folids. And I am the more inclined to this opinion, upon difcovering a like fediment in the urine of people in perfedl health, after long (landing ; as I confider this laft as either the redundance of the nu-, tritious matter, or what has been actually applied, but ceafes to be any longer of ufe. May we not therefore conclude, that the ferum is perpetually oozing into ulcers, but that, from the heat of the part, and the natural volatility of animal fluids, it is all quickly evaporated, excepting this mat- ter, that remains in the fore in the form of pus, and which is fo requifite in the cure.

61 SURGERY. 875. No good reafon occurs, for ima- gining that furgery (96.) is tarnifhed, al- though amputation, one of its moft power- ful remedies, may have been unavailingly employed to flay the ravages of mortifica- tion (788.). No remedy is univerfally fuccefsful. The moft Herculean expedi- ents are daily obferved to be abortive *. * A. C. a feafaring man about fifty years of age, was admitted into the Royal Infirmary of this city. He had a diflocation at the ankle, and a fratture of the fibula of the fame leg, about three inches from its inferior extremity, and a correfpondent wound of the covering parts. Mortification extending upwards foon made its appearance ; amputation was inftituted above the knee, with a view of checking its progrefs. This remedy was unfuccefsful. I alhlted at the con- futation, and readily advifed the operation mention- ed, as the only expedient that was capable to afford the unfortunate fufferer any chance of furvival. 1 he drawback in this cafe feemed to be the too late adop- tion of amputation. Within thefe few days paf!, mortification induced by local violence proceeded fatally beyond the place of injury. A gardener aged ninety-four years, living in the neighbourhood of this city, had his leg a little above the ankle miferably fra&urcd and wounded by the wheel of a loaded cart. Forefeeing that inflamma- tion, likely to affume the termination by mortification, was to enfue, I propofed inftantaneous amputation. He would not fubmit. Mortification acceded. Hcexpi- red within three days from the time of the violence.

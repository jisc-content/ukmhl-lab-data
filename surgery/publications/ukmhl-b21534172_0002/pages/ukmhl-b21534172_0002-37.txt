SURGERY. 29 dependently of its being exceedingly com- pounded and involved, and its adoption, eafe efpecially appears at feafons liable to frequent and confiderable viciflitudes of heat and cold. To this we may add, that the parts of the body moll frequently affedted with inflammation, are thofe expofed both to over diftenfion from a change in the diftribution of the fluids, and at the fame time to the immediate adtion of cold. Hence quinfies and pneumo- nic inflammations are more frequent than any other. That a fpafm of the extreme vdlels takes place in inflammations, we prefume further from what is at the fame time the ftate of the whole arterial fyftem. In every conliderable inflammation, though arifing in one part only, an affedtion is communicated to the whole fyftem, in confequence of which an inflamma- tion is readily produced in other parts befides that firft affected. This general affedtion is well known to phyfleians under the name of Diathesis Phlogi- stic a. It appears moft commonly in perfons of the mod rigid fibres ; is often manifeftly induced by the tonic or altringent powers of cold ; is increal'ed by all tonic and ftimulant powers applied to the body ; is always attended with a hardnefs of the pulfe ; and is moft ef- fectually taken off by the relaxing power of blood- letting. From thefe circumftances it feems probable, that the diathefis phlogiftica coniifts in an increafed tone, or contractility, and perhaps contraction of the mufcular fibres of the whole arterial fyftem. buch 2 flate of the fyftem prefumes a fpafm of the extreme veflels ; and the general ftate commonly arifes from that begun in a part; though it be alfo probable, that the general ftate may arife and fubfift, for fame

The external jugular veins, thofe fituated at the bending of the arm, exterior to the tendon of the biceps mufcle, andupon the upper part of the foot, and near the ankle, being confiderably re- mote from, the larger branches of the arterial and nervous fyftems, are commonly feled:- ed for the fubjedlof venaefedtion (1710.). Dexterity joined with caution may fafely perform it in any fituation of vein, f. 1713 . 2; Method of diflenfion, and its de- gree.—Experience fhews, that, a confider- able diflenfion of a vein to be opened by phlebotomy (ry 10.) is neceflary to afford refiflerxe to the inflrument performing it, \ f Is not phlebotomy practicable with fafety in the internal jugular vein, at its inferior part, near the clavicle, immediately to the infertion of the fterno- cludo maftoid mufcle into that bone ? and may not a more fudden depletion of the veflels of the head, in the apoplectic ftate, be obtained) than from any other point of the venous fyftem ?

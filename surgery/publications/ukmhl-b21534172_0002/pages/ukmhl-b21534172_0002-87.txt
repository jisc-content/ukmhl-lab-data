Determining whether peripneuma- ny (895.) be refident in the parenchyma- tous, membranous, or vafcular part of the lungs, or in all of thefe combinedly, is a: point very little confequential *. Special Cure. 898. The peculiar ftrudture of the lungs,; and their indifpenfable function, inculcate in the ftrongeft manner the expediency of the utmoft exertion to divert peripneumo- ny (895.) from reaching fuppuration(785.) or mortification (788.): The latter of thefe will always prove a mortal events * Some phyficians have imagined, that peripneu- mony begins in the parenchyma or cellular texture of the lungs, and has its feat chiefly there. But it feems to me very doubtful if any acute inflammation of the lungs, or any difeafe which has been called peripneu- mony, be of that kind : It feems probable that every acute inflammation begins in membranous parts, &c.

28 ELEMENTS of 805. The idea of the proximate caufe of inflammation now recited (804.), in- mation feems probable from hence, that every con- fiderable inflammation is introduced by a cold ftage, and is accompanied with that and the other circum- ftances of pyrexia j and it feems alfo probable, that fomething analogous to this occurs even in the cafe of thofe inflammations which feem lefs confulerable, and to be purely topical. From all this, the nature of inflammation may be often explained in the following manner. borne caufes of inequality in the diftribution of the blood may throw an unufual quantity ol it upon particular veflels, to which it muft neceflarily prove a Aimulus. But, further, it is probable, that, to relieve the congeftion, the vis medicatrix naturae increafes Hill more the adtion of thefe veflels, which it eftedts by the formation of a fpafm in their extremities, as in all other febrile difeafe^ A fpafm, therefore, of the extreme veflels, fupjmrt- ing an increafed adflon in the courfe of the fame, may be confidered as the proximate caufe of inflammation, at leaf in all cafes not ariftng from direct ftimuli ap- plied. That, in inflammation, there is the concurrence of a copflriftion of the extreme veflels with an increafed adhon in the other parts of them, feems probable from the confideration of rheumatifm. This is a fpe- cies of inflammation which is often manifleftly produ- ce1 either by cold applied to over diflended veflels, or by caufes of an increafed impetus, and over diflen- fion in veflels previoufly conflridted. Hence, the difÂ«

488 ELEMENTS of thread forming it being fixed on pieces of quill or .the like (clavi), placed on each fide of wound near its margin, inftead of be- ing tied over it: 3. Glovers (futura pellionum) : This confifts in a feries of connected or con- tinued ftitches forming a learn : 4. Twilled (futura tortilis), formed by regularly twilling a thread about one or more pins of gold or filver palfed tranfverfe- ly through the approximated edges of wound. 5. Styptic (futura llyptica): It confifts in inclofing a bleeding veftel in a Hitch generally formed by two femicircular mo- tions of a crooked needle. A hook (tena- culum) or artery-forceps are requifite to draw the veftel beyond the furface of wound, when none of the neighbouring parts are to be included. As no needle is thus neceftary, it is literally tying or ligature *. * This variety of Suture, from its being chiefly employed to reftrain haemorrhage, feems to merit the appellation ofJlyptic, and from its importance worthy to be ranked with the others. See Mr Aiken (an ingenious Surgeon of Warring- ton) his Treatife on the Ligature of Arteries.

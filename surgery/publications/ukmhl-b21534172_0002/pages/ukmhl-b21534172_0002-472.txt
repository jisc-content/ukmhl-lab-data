464 ELEMENTS of rience fliews to be the leaft dimenfion ca- pable to tranfmit the child’s head, or to permit parturition (1582.) *. * The proper adult female bafon, at its brim, may- be regarded as an ellipfis, or oval figure, whofe longeft diameter, five inches and one quarter, extends betwixt the olfa iliQm ; its fhorteft one, four inches and one quarter, ftretches betwixt the facrum and fymphyfis of the ofia pubis j the diftance of the extre- mity of the os coccygis and junfture of the ofia pubis is nearly five inches, that of the tubera ifchiorum from one another nearly four inches : Behind, where the bafon is very confiderably concave, its depth is fix inches ; at its Tides, four inches ; at its fore part, two inches. A fruall variation of thefe dimenfions may exift without materially affedling parturition. A line parallel to and in the axis of the pelvis nearly pafles through the anus. The child’s head refembles an oblong fpheroid, whofe circumference is nearly fifteen inches; its longeft axis, extending from finciput to occiput, five inches; its Ihorteft one, from ear to ear, four inches. Thefe dimenfions vary like thofe of the cavity of the pelvis : The unoflified jun&ure of its bones renders it capable ofTuffering with impunity furprifmg altera- tion of form, and of accommodating itfelf to the fuc of the bafon. It is evident, from confidering the refpettive di- menfions of the child’s head and bafon, that the for- mer can only enter the brim of the latter, and be tranfmitted by a coincidence of their longeft axis arid longeft diameter. 1 he point at which the neck, joins ihe head, and the manner of the articulation, ne-

5s ELEMENTS of 865. The acceflion of floughing (863.} is announced by a florid or inflamed line circumfcribing the mortified portion (862.), in the courfe of which pus (784.) becomes more and more perceptible till feparation is completed. 866. The inflammation (776.) invefting mortification (788.), and ending in fuppu- ration (785.), and facilitating the hough- ing (863.), is, in general, not a part of the inflammation which had terminated by mortification. It is recent, and may be produced by the acrimony of the dead matter adling as an occaflonal caufe (791.), which fometimes feems to be fo powerful as fatally to extend its influence. 867. It feems to be a reafonable afler- tion, that, fubflances may be antifeptic (118.) over dead (26.) and not over living (25.) matter. With refpecfl to the for- mer, if any advantage is fuppofed to be derived from retarding complete corrup- tion after inflammation, proper antifep- tics may be locally applied ; among which are fupereminent, feparately or com- binedly.

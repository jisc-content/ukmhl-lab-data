SURGERY. 57 circumfcription of the mortification (788.). It ought therefore to be promoted *. * Afcer a gangrene has in fome degree taken place, it can be cured only by the reparation of the dead front the living parts. 1 his, in certain circumftances, can be performed, and molt properly, by the knife. In other calcs, it can be done by exciting a fuppu» ratory inflammation on the verge of the living part, whereby its cohelian with the dead may be every ■where broken off, lb that the latter may fall off by itfelf. While this is doing, it is proper to prevent the farther putrefaftion of the part, and its Ipreading wider. For this purpofe, various antifeptic appli- cations have been propofed. But we are of opinion, that, while the integuments are entire, rhefe applica- tions can hardly have any efleft:; and therefore that the fundamental procedure mull be to lcarify the part, fo as to reach the living fubftance, and, by the •wounds made there, to ex.ite the fuppuracion required. By the fame incilion, alfo, we give accefs to antifep- tics, which may prevent the progrefs of the putrefac- tion in the dead, and excite inflammation in the living parts. When gangrene proceeds from a lofs of tone, and when this, communicated to the neighbouring parts, prevents that inflammation which, as we have faid, is neceflary to the feparation of the dead part from the living, it will be proper to obviate this lofs of tone by tonic medicines given internally; and, for this purpofe, the Peruvian bark has been found to be efpe- cially effectual. i hat this medicine operates by a to- nic power, we have endeavoured to prove.

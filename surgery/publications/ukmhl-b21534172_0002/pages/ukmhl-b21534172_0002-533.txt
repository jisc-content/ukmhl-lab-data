SURGERY. 525 a proper chirurgic opening through the ikull without the afliftance of a circular law (modiolus), by which excifton (1652.) of a piece of it neceftarily takes place. A juft execution of this ftep of trepaning bu- ftnefs (1737-) requires attention to 1. The feledtion of place. 2. The mode. 3. The inftruments. 1741. 1. The feledllon of place. —The up- per portion of the Ikull alone is acceftible to trepaning (1737.) : Thofe parts admit it moft favourably whi«h are of equal thick- nefs, and freeft from vafcular furrows and pits. Dexterity, however, will not hefitate to attempt it, when neceftity urges, in the fagittal future itfelf. Such, however, can feldom exift, becaufe a perforation near it on each fide is likely to fulfil every indica- tion (99.). Deliberate progrefs, and fre- quent examination, are indifpenfably ne- ceftary. Detaching the membrane of the bone (pericranium) previoufly to the appli- cation of the faw, is not only a needlefs, but injurious ftep. Frequent perforations, and elevation of fragments, are not feldom indicated.

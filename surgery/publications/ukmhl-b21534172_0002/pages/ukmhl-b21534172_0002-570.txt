562 E L E M E N TS of Rectification of Wry-Neck. 1828. Mode and InJIrumcnts.—Rectifica- tion (1822.) of wry-neck (743.) is at- tained by dividing the maftoid mufcle, whofe contraction is its caufe. This is efFeCled by forming a wound of the inte- guments in the direction of the mufcle fo as to permit a probe-rafor, or any fuited inftrument f, to be inlinuated half an inch beyond irs proper fituation, greatly in- creafing the deformity. In confultation with Dr Da- vid Spence of this city, it was determined to reduce the projecting portion of jaw by partially dividing it with a fin? faw immediately under the noitrils, its piece of lip, which could not be uleful, being previ- oufly removed, and then to join the lip. '1 his deli- cate and new plan of cure I fuccelsfully cai ried into execution. I had heard of a nearly fnnilar cafe of hare-lip, where the projecting maxillary portion was totally cut off, and the lip afterwards united. By inventing a commodious forceps to fuflain the lip, fo as to effeft an accurate exeition,—by forming it fo as to efteift the excillon at the fame.—by adopt- ing dry future, as defcribed, in place' of the uniting bandage,—by difcarding the ufe of a forceps named port-aiguille, deemed neceflary to hold the needles—by injoining the patient to fwallow blood efFufed into the month during perfomance, I prefume 1 have brought the operation of hare-lip to its utmoft perfeftion. f The knife already mentioned is well calculated to divide the maftoid mufcle.

SURGERY. 23* DiagiioJUc. \ 1163. The difcrimmation of true aneu- ryfm (1162.) from other diftindtions is not difficult, when lituated in the extremi- ties, or acceffibly *. * That kind of dilatation of the arterial tube which is called a true aneuryfm, is fometimes formed in the middle, and fometimes in the upper part of the thigh, and fometimes in the ham. The general chara&eriftic marks of this ddlemper are a circumfcribed tumour, fmall at its fird appear- ance, but gradually increafing, and for fotne length of time having a'pulfatory motion, and felt exactly correfpondent with the patient’s pulfe at the wrifl : This pulfation, arifing from the motion of the blood through the artery, is eafily feen and felt for fome length of time ; but as the tumour becomes gradually larger, the pulfation in it becomes more and more ob- feure to the touch; and in length of time, when either the artery is dilated to a very confiderable five, or has burft, and has fhed part of its contents, the motion becomes in fome cafes fo oblcure, as fcarcely to be felt at all, or at leall not without very diligent attention. When it has got into this date, whether it be femoral or popliteal], the lower part of the limb becomes, by preflure of the extravafated blood, and by the ob- ftruction to the circulation through the dilated artery, confiderably loaded and fwollen, unfit for ufe or mo- tion, and in general very painful.

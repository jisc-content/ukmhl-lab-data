SURGERY. 407 ReduRion. 1494. To reduction (1493.), feldom dif- penfable as to fraCture (1482.), particular- ly when oblique (1483.) , extenfion is al- moft always a neceflary preliminary ; it is applied cautioufly according to refiftence (which is as the mufcular power), in the healthful direction of the broken bone, while the mufcular relaxation is confult- ed *. The fooner after the infliction of the injury, the more ealily is reduction practi- cable : Recovery of form is a certain mark of its completenefs. 1495. Reduction (1493.) of compound fraCture (1485.) is fometimes rendered dif- ficult by the protrufion of one or more fragments from its wound (1441.). This obftacle may be furmounted by, 1. Enlarging the wound (1441.): 2. Amputation of the protruding bone. The firft of thefe expedients is obvioufly ducenda et adaptanda, inque hoc fitu, quamdiu res ex- igit, retinenda ; fymptomata avertenda vel initiganda; fequelae praepediendae.

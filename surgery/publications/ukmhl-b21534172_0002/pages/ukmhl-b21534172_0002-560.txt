The ftaff is retired, and the for- ceps introduced along the gorgeret, which is next withdrawn, and the ftone (958.) intercepted, is cautioufly and dextroufly extracted : A plurality often exifts. 1806. Difficulties.â€”The incihve part of lateral cyftotomy (1804.) is of eafy execu- tion : indeed introducing the beck of the gorgeret into the groove of the ftaff re- quires attention ; the operation, upon the whole, is not without difficulties. The chief are, 1. Catching the flone in the forceps, efpecially when fmall, or the bladder dif- eafed. 2. Extracting the flone, when friable or large. The fragments (it is often broken) are extracted with a fpoon-like inftrument. * The ingenious Frere Come and others have in- vented various inftruments to be uled inftead of the cutting gorgeret.

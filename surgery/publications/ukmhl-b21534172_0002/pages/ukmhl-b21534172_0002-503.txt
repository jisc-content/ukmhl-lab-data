SURGERY. 495: 1657.—3. Form of the amputative 'wound (1652)—Cicatrization (1443.), being the concretion of the wounded integuments over the fubjacent parts, is expeditious in proportion to their prefervation ; a circum- ftance as much as poffible to be confulted, particularly by due attention to their con- tractility; becaufe experience has manifeft- ed, fometimes fatally, that an oppohte con- duct creates a pointed or pyramidal flump- in every refpect injurious. Hence the pro- priety of a double *, or rather triple, but That amputation in the joint of the hip is not an impracticable operation (although it be a dreadful one) I very well know. I cannot fay that I have ever done it, but I have feen it done, and am very fure i {hall never do it, unlefs it be on the dead body. The parallel that is drawn between this operation and that in the joint of the Ihoulder will not hold. Pott’s Works, vol. iii. p. 41a. * Cheselden has the honour of reviving the ufe of Double Incifion of the foft parts in Amputation ; a rational praftice, not obfcurely taught by Celsus. “ Inter fanam et vitiatam partem incidenda fcalpello caro ufque ad os ; reducenda ab ea fana caro, et circa os fubfecanda eft, ut ea quoque parte aliquid oflis nu- detur; dein id ferrula praecidendum quam proxime fanae carni etiacn inhaerenti. Cutis, fub ejufmodi cu» ratione, laxa efle debet, ut quam maxirne os undique contegatur,” whofe fentiment feems not to be gene* rally underftood.

48 ELEMENTS of fuppuration (78 5'.), becaufe it depends on it. 841. It is highly probable, and not a little confonant to experience, that the rup- ture of impoflhume (840.), or the deftruc- tion of the containing parts, will happen at the point of its furface that is the leaft fupported ; becaufe fluids prefs equal- ly on all fides. 842. The circumftance peculiarly effi- cient in the rupture of impoilhume (840.) feems to be, 1. The mechanical ^ aflion of the con- 's. The chemical 3 fined matter. Artificial opening of Impoflhume. 843. In general, a fpontaneous rupture (840.) of impoflhume (786.) may be per- mitted. Formed, however, in or near or- gans of indifpenfable importance, whole fun&ion may be diflurbed or impaired by its maturation, an artificial opening * i» of the integuments, and favour their erofion.

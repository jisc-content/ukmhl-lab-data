Sigault, afliited by Dr Le Roy of Paris, about tv» o years agoi had the honour for the firft time to perform on the living human body. The fhare-bones receded mutually fomewhat more than two inches and an half; a living child was confequently extracted through a bafon, whofe lhortefl: diameter was only two inches and an half, which by demonftratioi* is thus proportionally, although not fomuch, lengthened as isitslongeft one.

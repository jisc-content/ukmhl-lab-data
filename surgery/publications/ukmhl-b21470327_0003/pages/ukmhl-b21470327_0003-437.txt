We trust, then, that our readers will receive with peculiar indulgence our present essay, which, however imperfect, will be found, if we mistake not, to have opened up a mine of valuable knowledge from wliich some more skilful labourer in the same line will yet draw adcUtional stores of information to the profession. Of course it will be readily seen, that we do not pretend to give an ac- ji count of all the articles introduced into the practice of medicine j! by the Arabians; that, even if we were possessed of the requi- f site knowledge of the oriental languages, would evidently be i out of the question within our narrow limits.

And here it is but right that we should acknowledge that the translation itself would have been to us 'a sealed book" if our learned friend.

It may be proper to mention, that the articles which are liere described are set down in the same order as the notices of t hem were composed, because we could not satisfy ourselves with regard to any methodical arrangement which would conveniently ipply to them and be in unison with the general plan of this work.

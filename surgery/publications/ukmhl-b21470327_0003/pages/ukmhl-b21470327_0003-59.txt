SECT. III.] 47 SIMPLES. 'A-VTippivov or 'Avappivov, Antin'inon, or ABarriuon, Snapdragon, has properties re- sembling tliose of tlie buboniurQj but weakerj whence you may learn its properties. Commentary. Galen writes of this article, Antirrinum Comm. i Orontium, or Calfsnout, as being of no nse in medicine. (De ' * ' : Simpl. V.) Dioscorides, also, mentions it only as an amulet land external application, (iv, 131.) It is scarcely noticed by tthe other authorities.

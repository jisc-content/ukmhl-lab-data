Commentary. Celsus informs us that they are the same Comm. as the pastilli of the Latins. He thus describes their general' " ' properties : " Pastilli haec ratio est: arida medicamenta con- trita humore non pingui, ut vino vel aceto, coguntur, et rursus coacta inarescunt, atque, ubi utendum est, ejusdem generis humore diluuntui'." He gives prescriptions for six trochisks. (v. 20.) Galen remarks that trochisks derive their name from their spherical shape. He treats of them at great length in the fifth book of his work ' De Comp. Med. sec. gen.' Many of our author's receipts are copied from him. .

Moses Charras gives the following account of trochisks : ''They are also called pastils, rolls, cakes, and lozenges. Trochisks were invented as well to preserve a long time the virtue of certain medicaments as to unite together tlie virtue of several. To which purpose having finely powdered the ingre- dients, which are to be powdered, they are to be incorporated with some juice, syrup, or other viscous liquor, to make there- with a solid paste, out of which are formed little trochisks, flat,

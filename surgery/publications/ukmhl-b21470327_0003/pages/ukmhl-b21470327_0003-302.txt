290 SIMPLES. [book Vll. Comm. Ebn Baithar (i, 191.) The last of these is particularly full under this head. TlayKpariov, Pancratium^ Sea-daffodil, in appearance and powers is like the squillj but is weaker. Comm. Commentaky. There are two varieties of the Scilla mari- ' " ' iima, or Squill^ namely, the white and the red. The jmncration would appear to be the red variety. See Alston (Mat. Med.); Pereira (Mat. Med. 651); and Lindley (Veg. King. 203.) Dioscorides, like our author, states of it, that it has the same powers as the squill, but in a weaker degree ; and that it is prepared in the same manner, and used in the same affections j for example, in diseases of the spleen and dropsies, (ii, 203.)

Thus, he says, it is expectorant, lithontriptic, and alexipharmic, its leaves and root being astrin- gent, so as to stop looseness of the bowels, and that it is diuretic and discutient externally, (i, 121.) Galen and Aetius treat of it in nearly the same terms as our author. We have not been able to detect it in the Mat. Med. of the Arabians. HdvaKeg, Panaces, All-heal; it is from that species called Heraclium, from which the substance named opopouax is produced, being heating in the third degree, desiccative in the second, emollient

[book VII. 246 SIMPLES. Comm. proves vermifuge, not only when eaten, but when applied ex- ' ' ' ternally to the belly; for it was formerly shown that a bitter juice floes this. Nor that it removes leprosy^ clavus, and myr- mecia, need it seem wonderful to one who remembers what was formerly said. And thus it relieves orthopnoea, and promotes menstruation, when it is restrained by the thickness and viscidity of the humours; and, in a word, when we wish to incide, cleanse, dry, and heat, it is a most useful medicine. (De Simpl. viii.) Having given so full an exposition of Galen's views, we must be brief on those of the other authorities. The gith occurs in the Mat. Med. of Hippocrates, but is not to be met with in the works of Celsus. For the Arabians, see Avicenna (ii, 2, 516); Bhases (Cont. 1. ult. i, 496) ; Serapion (c. 328.) They all follow closely in the footsteps of Dioscorides and Galen. Though the gith has ceased for some time past to be used in medicine, it is still sometimes sought after as a spice. See Gray (Suppl. to Pharmacop. 123.)

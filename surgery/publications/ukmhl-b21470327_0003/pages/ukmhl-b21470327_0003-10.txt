vi ADVERTISEMENT TO THE THIRD VOLUME. clature of the present age. Accordiugly it will be found that the Commentary in this volume abounds in references to modern authorities, and contains a variety of materials col- le.cted, not only from the earlier herbalists and commentators on DioscorideSj Theophrastus, and other ancient authors, but likewise from recent writers on T3otany, Mineralogy, and the Materia Medica, in illustration "of the various articles which are treated of in this work. And I have much satisfaction in having it in ray power to state that the plan now described has the authority and sanction of the Council, who gave it their entire approval. To Dr. Pereira I owe my grateful ac- knowledgment for much valuable advice and assistance received from him on this part of my work; but at the same time it is fair to him to state I have no right to make him in anywise responsible for opinions herein advanced which may turn out to be erroneous. And now, having brought my laborious undertaking to a conclusion, I would embrace the present opportunity of re- turning my most sincere expression of thanks to the Council for the honour which they conferred upon me in selecting my work for pubhcation, and for the very flattering terms in which they speak of the first volume in the Annual Report of their proceedings for 1845. I trust that whatever degree of merit they discovered in it will be found not to be wanting in the succeeding parts, and that, taken together, the three volumes will be acknowledged to constitute a more copious repertory of ancient opinions on professional subjects than is to be found elsewhere. If such be the judgment which the intelligent members of the Sydenham Society shall genei-ally pronounce on my work, I shall certainly never regret the time and exertions which I have bestowed iipon it.

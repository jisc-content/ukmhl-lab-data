490 [book VII, SIMPLE PURGATIVES. Comm. mistake in the comparison of it to tlie ferula, as there is no ' * ' resemblance between them. An accurate modern author, Moses Charras, calls it the bark of a milky root, -which is chosen by its weight, dark-coloured without, white Avithin, and clear from its pith, which is hard and fibrous. Mesue repre- sents it to be a hot, nauseous purgative. It is given in powder, he says, to the amount of from one to two drachms. Serapion recommends Cholagogues particularly in jaundice, inflammatory aff'ections of the brain, mania, epilepsy, erj'sipelas, herpes, and tertian fever. He describes the following medi- cines as cholagogues: aloes, southernwood, black hellebore, scammony, colocynth, agaric, elaterium, two species of mezereon, lathyris, the root of the lily, centaury, polypody, birthwort, myrobalans (the yellow, the black, and the chebulic), pome- granate, cassia fistula, violet, ivy, and two Arabian substances unabac and alterariabin. We are unable to determine what the last two were. A modern writer, Christianus Margravius, in his ' Materia Medica Contracta,' thus enumerates the cholagogues of his time. Cholagoga, Cassia, manna, tamarindi, succusque rosarum, Scammoiiium, myrobalani, rliabavbarum, aloe. Professor Alpinus gives an accurate account of the ancient cholagogues. (Meth. Med. iii, 9.)

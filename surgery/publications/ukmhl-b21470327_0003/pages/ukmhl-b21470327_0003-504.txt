492 SIMPLE PURGATIVES. [book Vll. Comm. Averrlioes states that the lapis lazuli is the most potent ' ' ' medicine of this class. (Collig. v, 43.) On Phlegmagogues. Mesue's list is as follows : ■fi Clementer. Valenter. 'Cuicus. fEuphorbium. Plilecmaeoca<; ^^P^ilus- 1 Opoponax. b b b 'I Hyssopus. Lachryma ( Scammoniuin. LEupatorium etiam cholag. I Sagapenum. [SarcocoUa. Serapion directs us to administer these medicines to persons of a cold habit, in cold seasons of the year, to those affected with anasarca and apoplexy, in sciatica and hemorrhages. His list is little different from our author's. Margravius enu- merates the phlegmagogues as follows : Phlegmagoga— Carthamus, agaricus, turpeth, mechoaca, jalappa, Eniblica, bellirica;, chebulas, colocyiithis, amara, Hermodactylus, euphorbium, opoponax, sagapenum. On Hydragogues. The hydragogue properties of the elder- tree are commended by Boerhaave and Sydenham. See the section on Dropsy in the Third Book. There is some difficulty in determining what the cneoros was. We are inclined to think that it was the cassia fistula, the medicinal characters of which, as stated by Mesue among the Arabian, and Prosper Alpinus among the modern, authorities, correspond with the account of cneoros given by our author. Gum ammoniac is an ingredient of the purgative salt, a receipt for which is given by Apicius. It also enters into the sales pm-gatorii of Myrepsus. (ii, 9 and 10.) See the com- mentary on the next Section. Prosper Alpinus says of the coccum gnidium, or fruit of the thymelEea, that in doses of fifteen grains it is a strong purga- tive, and evacuates principally serous humoiu-s in dropsy. He reckons the squama seris among the drastic purgati^^es. Serapion's account of the hydragogues is nearly the same as our author's. The following is Margravius's list of them : Esula, gratiola, atque ireos succus, mechoaca, Post ebuli semen, et succus, cortcxque claterium, Soldauella virens, et gummi gulta, jalappa.

SIMPLES. [book VII. 46 ''AvrjOov, Anethum, Dill; it warms in the second degree intensely, and dries in nearly the same degree. Wlien boiled in oil it is diaphoretic, anodyne, and soporific; and concocts crude swellings. But when burnt it becomes of the third order of heating and drying medicines, and is useful when sprinlded upon foul ulcers. But the green is more humid, and less hot and digestive. Comm. COMMENTARY. Our author condenses and abridges the ' account of the dill {Anethum graveolens) given by Galen. Dioscorides, in his usual empirical stjde, recommends it for various purposes, such as promoting the flow of milk, stopping slight vomiting, opening the bowels, increasing the urine, proving useful to hysterical women in a hip-bath, and so forth, (iii, 60.) The Arabians as usual copy from both. See Avi- cenna (ii, 3, 69.) AvBvWiQ, Anthyllis; there are two varieties, both of which are desic- cant applications to ulcers; but that resembling the ground- pine consists of more subtile particles, so as to be beneficial in epileptic cases. It is also more detergent. Comm. COMMENTARY. The former species, which Dioscorides de- scribes and recommends for the cure of wounds, we would willingly refer to the Anthyllis vulneraria, but the predomi- nance of authority is against it, and in favour of the Cressa cretica. The other is probably the Ajuga Iva. A\'icenna joins Dioscorides in commending it as a vulnerary herb (ii, 2, 744), for which virtue the anthyllis was long celebrated^ as its scientific name implies. ''A.vi}aov, Anisum, Anise; the seed is particularly acrid, eating, and drying in the third degree. Hence it is diuretic and dispels flatus. Comm. COMMENTARY. Serapion and Avicenna, like the Greek ' * ' authorities, call the Pimpinella anisuni diuretic and emmena- gogue. It is now reckoned the first of the four hot seeds, the other three being carui, cumin, and fennel.

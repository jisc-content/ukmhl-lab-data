[book VII. 24 SIMPLES. Aiy'i\w(p, iEgilopSj Cockle, is possessed of discutient powers, whence it cures indurated inflammations and legilops (fistula lachry- malis.) Comm. Commentary. There is great difficulty in determining the ' * ' grasses of the ancients. This may be seen by consulting the ' Herbal' of Gerarde on this subject. The present article was probably the JEgilops ovata. Dioscorides gives nearly the same account of it as our author, who copies Galen. He further mentions that the juice of it, mixed up with flour and dried, was laid up for use (iv, 136.) The Arabians borrow closely from Dioscorides. See in particular Avicenna (ii, 2, 211), and Serapion (c. 25.) ''AtyEtpoCj Populus nigra, the Black Poplar; it is heating in the first degree, moderately desiccative, and consists of fine particles. Its leaves, when applied with vinegar, remove gouty pains ; but the resin of it being hotter than the leaves, is mixed with restorative ointments and emollient plasters. But its fruit, when drunk with vinegar, is beneficial to epileptics. Comm. COMMENTARY. There can be no doubt that it is the ' ' ' Populus nigra. Our author and all the other authorities, both Greek and Arabian, copy closely from Dioscorides (i, 110.) We will have occasion to treat of its gum or resin afterwards. See Karabe. Celsus does not mention the black poplai-. The a'ljiipoq KpnriKr) of Hippocrates was no doubt a A'ai'iety of Populus nigra. For the Arabians, consult in paiticular A^dcenna (ii, 2, 333, 340, 364); Serapion (c. 266); and Ehases (Cont. 1. ult. i, 165.) AlSoiO)', Testiculus, the testicle of a stag, when dried and triturated with wine and drunk, is a remedy to those who have been bitten by vipers. It is also mixed Avith compound medicines. Comm. COMMENTARY. Sextus Platonicus in like manner recom- —-—' mends the privy parts of a stag as an antidote for poisons. All copy from Dioscorides (ii, 46.) 'Ai0a/\»; and X«yvue will be treated under A.

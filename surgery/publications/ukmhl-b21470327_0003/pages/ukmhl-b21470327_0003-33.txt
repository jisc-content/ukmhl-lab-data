Our author would appear Comm. to have confounded these two articles together, and to have ' ' ' applied to the latter the characters which Dioscorides gives to the other. The modern herbalists agree with the ancients in commending the couch-grass as being diuretic and lithon- triptic. None of the commentators or herbalists have given a satisfactory account of the esculent grass of Galen. The Arabians treat of the grasses very confusedly. See in parti- cular Avicenna (ii, 2, 704) ; Rhases (Contin. 1. ult. iii, 50); Serapion (c. 119.) In the modern Greek Pharmacopoeia the Triticum repens stands for the a. (p. 72.) Apuleius say& "Graeci agrostem Latini gramen appellant." ''Ayyrovaai, Anchusae, Alkanet; there are four varieties, all of which are not possessed of the same powers. For that which is called onoclea has a root which is astringent and somewhat bitter; whence it is useful in splenitic and nephritic cases.

Commentary. The first species is either the Anchusa tine- Comm. / toria L., or the Litliospermim tinctorium; the lycapsos, the ' * ' lEchium italicum L.; the alcibiadios, the Echmm diffusum, and tthe fourth species the Lithosj)ermum fruticomm. There is con- ssidcrable difficulty, however, in determining the alkanets of the >ancients. Our author, in his account of them, follows Galen, Â»who, in his turn, copies from Dioscorides. Avicenna, Rhases, >and Haly Abbas borrow all they say of them from Dioscorides land Galen.

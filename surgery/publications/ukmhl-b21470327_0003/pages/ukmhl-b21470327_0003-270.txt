That from the limbs is more fatty and emollient; but that from the spine is harder and drier. Comm. COMMENTARY. According to Aristotle, the MaiTOw is a superfluity concocted from the nutritive blood of the bones. Pie states that the spinal marrow is considerably different from that of the other bones. (De Partibus Animalium, ii, 7.) Pliny, copying from Dioscorides, thus deHvers the general characters of marrows : " Omnes molliunt, explent, siccant, calefaciunt." (H, N. xxviii, 39.)

26 SIMPLES. [book VII. Comm. COMMENTARY. Our author abridges this article from Galen. " ' ' See also in particular Serapion (De Simpl. ex Animalibus.) Loliuxn, Darnel, is heating and drying, almost in the third degree, being equal in power to the iris. Comm. COMMENTARY. This, which is the Zizanien of the Arabians, ' " ' may be set down as the Lolium temulentum. Dioscorides gives . the fullest account of its medicinal faculties; he recommends it along with radishes and salt as an application to gangrenous and spreading sores, and with sulphur and vinegar for lichen and lepra; when boiled with pigeon's dung and linseed in wine for discussing strumous and indolent tumours; for ischiatic disease boiled with mulse and applied as a cataplasm; and used in a fumigation with myrrh, saffron, and frankin- cense, he says it promotes conception (ii, 122.) Aetius says, it is more acrid but less attenuant than iris. We have not been able to find it noticed in the works of Hippocrates nor in those of Celsus. The Arabians merely copy Dioscorides and Galen. See Serapion (c. 70) ; and Avicenna (ii, 2, 658.) Our old English hei'balists repeat the ancient characters of this plant. is th.e fruit of a shrub growing in Egypt, the decoction of which is an ingredient in the CoUyria, for promoting acute- ness of vision. Comm. COMMENTARY. Galen and Aetius have not treated of this ' ' ' article. Our author copies from Dioscorides, who, under the name of aKaKaWq, describes it as an Egyptian plant, resem- bling the myrica (i, 118.) We may thei'efore conjecture, with considerable probability, that it is merely some species or variety of the tamarix. It does not appear that it is treated of by the Arabians, nor have we found it in the works of Hippocrates or Celsus. Acacia is of the third order of desiccants, and of the first of cooling medicines; but if washed, of the second. It is sour and terrene.

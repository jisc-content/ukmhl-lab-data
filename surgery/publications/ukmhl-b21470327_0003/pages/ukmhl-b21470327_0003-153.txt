It is, therefore, a powerful I remedy for inflamed nipples, and for extinguishing the heat in r them. It also answers with buboes; but if too dry it niust 'be softened with oil of privet or oil of roses. Commentary. Sioeat, or the matter of Perspiration. Comm. " Sweat," says Galen, " is one of the fluids formed in the " * ' animal body, consisting of the same materials, and having the same mode of formation, as the urine, for both are formed from the liquids drunk, these being heated, and acquiring also some bihous property. But the sweat is more elaborated, as having passed through so many intervening bodies to the skin." (De Med. Simpl. x.)

Dioscorides mentions that birdlime s also got from the apple tree, the pear ti-ee, and other trees, md is found upon the roots of certain shrubs. Pliny describes Khe ordinary mode of preparing it. (H. N. xvi, 94.) Dioscorides |jrecommends it pnncipally as an agglutinative and attractive tpplication to indolent tumours and sores. When mixed with bhe caustic ley (quicklime and potass) he says birdlime in- reases its efficacy. With orpiment and sandarach, and applied

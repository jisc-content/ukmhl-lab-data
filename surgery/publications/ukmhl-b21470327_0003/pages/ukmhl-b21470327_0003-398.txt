The Arabians treat of it succinctly in mucli the same terms. See Rhases (Cont. 1. vdt. i, 5ol)j Avicenna (ii^ 2, 551.)

Having got acquired heat, as long as it preserves this it heats, but when it becomes cold, it cools. That which has a certain admixture, such as of natron or bitumen, acquires the property of the substance which is mixed with it.

It is fuUy treated of by us in Book I. See in " * ' particular Pliny (H. N. xxxi, 21); Avicenna (ii, 2, 58); and Rhases (Contin. 1. ult. i, 706.)

SECT. III. ON THE POWERS OP SIMPLES INDIVIDUALLY. Commentary. The part of our task upon which we are now Comm. entering is at once so arduous and important, that we cannot " * ' but feel diffident of our abilities to execute it properly. We may venture, however, to assure the reader that we have spared no pains as far as lay in our power to unravel the intricacies with which this department of ancient science is involved, and that, with this intention, upon every article we have care- fully compared the descriptions of the ancient authors, and have likewise availed ourselves of the learned labours of modern commentators on Theophrastus, Pliny, and Dioscorides.

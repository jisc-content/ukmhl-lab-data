257 SECT. III.] SIMPLES. Muoypov, Myagrum; the seed of it is fatty, and the oily part of it is possessed of an emplastic power. CoMMENTAKY. It is generally held to be the Camelina sativa, Comm. Crantz., of which we think there can be no doubt. Both Dios- ' • ' corides and Pliny mention it as producing an oil from its seed; and it is well known that the Camelina, or Gold of Paradise, is still noted as one of the oil plants. See Lindley (Veg. Kingd. 353.) The two authors mentioned above recommend this oil in ulcers of the mouth. Our author borrows from Galen. As far as we can discover, it is not treated of by the Arabian authorities, with the exception of Ebn Baithar, who merely quotes the description of it given by Dioscorides and Galen. Mua/c£c, Musculi, Muscles, have the same power, when burnt, as the buccina. But they have the property, when washed, of re- moving asperity of the eyebrows and leucomata when applied with honey. Their flesh is applied with advantage to persons bitten by dogs. Commentary. Called Mu'fc by Aristotle and Athenseus, Comm. Myaces by Pliny, and Musculi by Celsus, are the Mytili' '' ' edules, L., or Muscles. Celsus ranks them with those things •which open the bowels, (ii, 39.) He prescribes the soup of muscles as a purgative in fevers, (iii, 6.) Dioscorides merely recommends them externally as a stimulant and detergent apphcation in diseases of the eyes, and their flesh for the bites of mad dogs, (ii, 7.) The Arabians treat of them in general terms along with the other Crustacea. See particularly Avicenna (ii, 2, 529.) Muapo)', Myaron (called also Melampycnon) ; it is a branchy and fatty herb. The oil extracted from it would seem to smooth the asperities on the body. Commentary. This is clearly the same as the fxvay^ov Comm. described above. See Jani Cornarii doUabella in P. M. vii.

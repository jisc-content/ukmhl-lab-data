The latter gives a lengthy and in- teresting account of it. Rhases briefly notices it without saying anything of its medicinal uses. (Contin. 1. ult. ii, 681.) In the East the skink is still eaten as a restorative and aphro- disiac. See AinsKe (Mat. Ind. ii, 378.) Squilla, the Squill, is possessed of incisive powers, and is calefacient and desiccative in the second order. It is better to take it roasted or boiled. Commentary. It is the Scilla maritima.

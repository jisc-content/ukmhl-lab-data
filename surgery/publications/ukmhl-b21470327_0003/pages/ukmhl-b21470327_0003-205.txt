The use of it, however, was forbidden by the Mosaic law. In one of the Hippocratic treatises, the cochleae are recommended for procidentia ani. (De fistul.) Pliny, in like manner, recommends them in dysentery. (H. N. vii, 30.) Dioscorides and Galen give nearly the same account of their medicinal properties as our author. The latter says that they are difficult to digest, but very nutritious when digested. Celsus, on the other hand, ranks them among the weak articles of food.

Its seed when drunk kills worms, and especially the seed of the Egyptian cabbage does this. The ashes of its stalks when burnt are possessed of caustic powers, and with grease are applicable in chronic pains of the sides. The wild is stronger than the garden cabbage in all respects; 1 hence it cannot be taken internally without inconvenience. 1 The sea-cabbage being saltish and bitterish loosens the belly. 13

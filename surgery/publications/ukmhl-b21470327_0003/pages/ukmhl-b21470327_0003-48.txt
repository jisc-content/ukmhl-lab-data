[book VII, 36 SIMPLES, Comm. Commentaey. Many of the older commentators supposed '' this to be the plant which produces turbit, but we shall have occasion to discuss this question when treating of the additions to the Materia Medica made by the Arabians. What this article really was is very uncertain. Pliny and all the medical authorities mention its purgative powers. See in pai'ti- cular Dioscorides (iv, 177), from whom our author endently copies.

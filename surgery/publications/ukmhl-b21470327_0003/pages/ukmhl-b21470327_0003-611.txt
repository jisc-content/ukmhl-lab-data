In materials the cyphi are intermediate between the trochisks which are drunk and the antidotes. We use them sometimes i: in fumigations on account of their fragrance, and so also the i perfumes; sometimes we smell to them, in order to concoct Si catarrhs and defluxions, and as deobstruents, and to clear the ? parts about the brain, and as preservatives from pestilential i disorders ; they are also taken by the mouth for these purposes?, t and to concoct matters lodged in the chest, and for cold affec- tions in the liver: hence the ancients invented the antidotes c called cyphoid. They are mixed also with compound medicines, i and more especially with epithemes and antidotes. ! Suffimentum rosattm, rose perfume.

SIMPLES. 276 [book VII. Comm. notice it, do so in nearly the same language as our author. We have not been able to discover any traces of it in the works of the Arabians. Onobrychis, Cockshead, is possessed of aromatic and dis- cutient powers. It therefore discusses pliymata, cures strangury, and proves sudorific. Comm. COMMENTARY. Dioscorides describes it as having leaA'es ' * ' like the lentil, or a little longer, a stalk a fathom long, a pur- ple flower, and small root, and grows in wet and uncultivated grounds. This description seems clearly to point to the Ono- bnjchis sativa, a plant of the tribe Fabacece. Dioscorides holds it to be diuretic and sudorific, and discussive of tumours, (iii, 160.)

Comm. COMMENTARY; The Millepedes are thus described by ' â€¢ ' Marcellus Empiricus : " In locis humidis et sordidis sub lapidibus inveniuntur besfciolse multipedes quae contactte contra- liuntur et rotimdantur." (De Medicamentis, c. xxxv.) They are the Porceliones of Cielius Aurelianus (i, 4), who calls them- " animalia qua? himiectis et aquosis locis ssepe nascuntur, a Grc^cis appellata onisci." (Tard. Pass.) Almost all the ancient

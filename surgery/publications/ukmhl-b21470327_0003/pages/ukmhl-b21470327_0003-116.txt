It does not otherwise occur in Dioscorides, Galen, ' ' Serapion, or Avicenna. arivri, Elatine, the Toadflax; this herb is like the Helxine, and is moderately refrigerant and astringent. Comm. COMMENTARY. That the FluelHn or Female Speedwell " * [Linaria Elatine) is the elatine of the ancients has been long known and almost generally admitted. See Parkinson, Gerard, Rutty, &c. Dioscorides recommends the leaves with flour for inflammations and running of the eyes, and for dysen- tery. Pliny, evidently translating Dioscorides, says of the elatine, " eadem cum line semine cocta sorbitionis usu dysen- teria liberat." (H. N. xxvii, 50.) It would appear that it had been omitted by the Arabians. It held a place in our Dispen- satory with its ancient character down to a late period.

Our older herbalists and commentators are ' * ' pretty well agreed in holding it to be the garden parsnip {Pas- tinaca saliva.) Dioscorides pronounces it to be alexipharmic, and Aetius does the same. The other authorities treat very briefly of it. Avicenna calls the Pastinaca aphrodisiacal, and this reputation it maintained down to modern times. See Quincy. 'EXEXt'fT^a/coCj Salvia, Sage, is decidedly calefacient and subastringent. Comm. COMMENTARY. The sage [Salvia officinalis) has held a place " * ' in the Materia Medica from the earliest ages down to oui,. times. Dioscorides calls it diiu'ctic, emmenagogue, alexiphar. mic, and vulnerary. The other Greek authorities, hke our author, speak more moderately in its praise. The Arabians who treat of it follow Dioscorides. See Serapion (De Sirapl. 153.) In modern times it was at one period held in much esteem. See Quincy. It is retained in the modern Greek Pharmacopoiia (p. 142.)

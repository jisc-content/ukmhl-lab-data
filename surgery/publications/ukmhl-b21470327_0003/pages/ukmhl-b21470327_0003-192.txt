Galen and Aetius and Oribasius state its characters in brief terms, like our author. It would appear, in fact, to have been little used in medicine. The Arabians confound the thymelcea, chamelaja, and chamaeleon together, so that there is great difficulty in malving out what were their exact views on the Thymelacea:, Indeed, the genera of this tribe of plants are still with difficulty distinguished from one another.

It is VermUion or Scarlet grain, being the ' â€¢ ' product of a little hemopterous insect called kermes or Coccus ilicis. See Theophrastus (H. P. iii, 16), and Pliny (H. N. xvi, 12.)

The gum of the tree has the powers of an incisive and attenuate substance, so that some relate that when di'unk with wine it proves lithontriptic. With vinegar it is said to cure the lichen of children. The fruit of the wild plums is manifestly astringent, and constipates the belly. This plant in Asia is called Prumnum. The dried garden plums, now called damascenes, appear to be similar, as Galen says. Comm. COMMENTARY. Without doubt it is the Prunus insiticia or Bullace tree, a well known species of plum.

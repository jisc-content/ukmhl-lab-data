Theophrastus has treated more fully and ingeniously of botany and vegetable physiology than any other Greek writer; but except in two or three instances he scarcely alludes to the medicinal powers of the articles which he describes. In short, Dioscorides is the first and great autho- rity on the Materia Medica,â€”his contributions to which, can never be too liighly appreciated ; for, as Alston justly remarks, the science in anqient times remained ever after in nearly the same state as he left it.

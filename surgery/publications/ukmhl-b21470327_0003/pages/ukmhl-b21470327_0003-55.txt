It does Comm. not occur, we believe, in tbe Materia Medica of Hippocrates;' â€¢ ' lat least we have failed to detect it while writing this article. Anagallis, Pimpernel; both kinds are of sufficiently deter- fgent powers, having some hottish and attractive properties, sso that they extract thorns; and the juice of it purges by tthe nose. Commentary. These two well-known plants, namely, the Comm. cAnagallis arvensis and ccerulea, are included in all the ancient ' * ' lists of medicinal herbs, and were only of late excluded from )Our British Pharmacopoeias. All the authorities, ancient and lodern, give them the same characters as Dioscorides, to whom lOur author is principally indebted, (ii, 209.) He says they are ieful in diseases of the kidneys and liver. (1. c.) The ana- ;gallis does not occur in the works of Celsus. For the Arabians, bee Serapion (c. 155); Avicenna (ii, 3, 33.)

With the exception Tf Oribasius, who merely copies Dioscorides, we are not aware Jf any ancient writer that treats of it, with the exception of iibn Baithar, and he also merely copies the descriptions of it luven by Dioscorides and Galen.

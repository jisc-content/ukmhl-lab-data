â– SECT. IV.] 489 SIMPLE PURGATIVES. On Cholagogues. Most of these medicines are sufficiently Com well known, and therefore do not require to be treated of at' ^ greater length. See also Aetius (iii) and Oribasius (M. Col. The Arabian author Mesne gives the following table of Cholagogues: It will be perceived that this list contains several articles with which the Greeks were unacquainted, namely, myrobalani, tamarindi, manna, and turbith. Of all these substances we have already given some account in the Appendix to the Third Section. Mesne calls the tamarinds, the fruit of an Indian palm-tree, the word tamur signifying a date. He says, that they are excellent medicines for repressing the acrimonj^ of the humours, piirging bile, cooling the heat of the blood ; that they prove useful in hot fevers, javmdice, inflammation of the stomach and liver, and that they stop vomiting. He calls them refrige- rants and desiccants of the second order. To prevent them from hurting the stomach by their coldness, he recommends to give them with spikenard, mace, mastich, wormwood, fennel, or any such calefacients.

SECT. XXVI.] WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 613 The Pes is the standard from which the contents of the Comm. amphora, and of the other names of weights and measures in " ' ' the table are deduced; and, as our authorities assign slightly different estimates to the length of the pes, the other measures in the table are consequently affected by this difference in the assumed standard. Arbuthnot assumes the pes to be 11'604 inches, whereas Conger, with the later authorities, makes it to be -97075 ft. or 11-649 inches. Now the amphora, being the cube of-the pes, equals, according to Arbuthnot, 1563-5112 solid inches, whereas the cube of Conger's pes makes the am- phora to contain 1580*75 solid inches. Having thus pointed out the source of the discrepance between the tables of Arbuthnot and the later authorities, we shall now proceed with our extracts, beginning with Dr. Milligan, who, although he can have no pretensions to be reckoned an original authority on the subject, has been par- ticularly fortunate in giving from Targa and Arbuthnot, a very lucid exposition of the weights, measures, and characters, which occur in the works of Celsus.

Of this measure ' there were two kinds, the greater of which was the 16th part 1 of the cotyla, and the lesser the 4th part of the cyathus. The 1 mystrum is called (3dp(3oQ by Hesychius. . X»;^t»/ was so named from a shell-fish. There was a greater (or 7iistic cheme, the 20th part of the cotyla; but the lesser, ' which the physicians used, was the 30th part of the cotyla.

Their capacity and fproportion to one another is the same as when they are mea- ssures for liquids, which have been shown already. TTie Roman Measures of Capacity. The amphora, which ccontained 8 congii, was the cube of a pes, or foot. The con- ggius itself, the cube of i foot. The pes being settled, as equal tto 11*604 inches, its cube 1562'5112, gives the contents of the lamphora in solid inches; and divided by 8, gives 195-3139 iinches for that of the congius. The greatest measure among the Romans of liquid things, was the culeus, or culleus, containing 20 amphorje. A culeus lalso contains 40 urns, the urn being half the amphora. The amphora is otherwise called quadrantal, ccramium, cadus, land fiiT^r]Ti)q ItoXikoq. The urna is the 40th part of the culeus, lind the half of the amphora. The conr/ius was the 8th part of the amphora, and the 4th of the urna: it contained 6 sextarii. The congius in English measure contains 207-0676 solid inches, that is, 7 pints 4-942 oolid inches. The sextarius urbicus was the 6th part of tlie congius. This

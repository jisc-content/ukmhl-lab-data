6iO WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. [book vii. £, medimrius, thus ^; and if o, modius, thus /i. The letter r followed by a p with a v about it, indicates tryhlium, thus t/ju The letter ^, if it has e placed above it, indicates xestes (i. e. sextarius), thus ^\ But if it has o written above, it signifies oxybaphum (i. e. acetabulum), thus^". Some indicate a sextarius by a ^, with a straight line intersecting it, thus ^. The letter 7j, ha^ang ^ placed above it, indicated hemina, thus . The letter k prefixed to p, and having ju placed above it, indicates ceramium, thus Kp^, On Weights. The Attic and Egyptian mna (i. e, mina) contains oz. xvj. The Roman mina „ oz. xx. The libra (i. e. pound) . „ oz. xij. The uncia (i. e. OMwce) ' „ dr. viij. The drachma (i. e. drachm) , „ scr. iij. The scrupulus (i. e. scruple) „ oboli ij. The obolus contains ceratia or siliquse iij. lihe siliqua contains chalci (i. e. «m or «?-eo/z) ij.and§. So that an obolus contains viij sereoli. On the Measures of Liquids. The Italic ceramium contains choes (or congii) viij. The chiis or congius contains sextarii vj. The sextarius contains cotylse ij, which are also called tryblia. The cotyla, or tryblium, contains great mystra iij, but ace- tabula iv. The great mystrum contains acetabulum j, and a third. The acetabulum contains cyathus j, and a half. The cyathus contains small chemce, or small mystra ij. But if you would wish to know the measure of the weights of liquids (for there are many difi'erences of liquid substances according to weight), we shall illustrate this by the example of oil, wine, and honey. Honey, then, is heavier than wine by a fourth part, and a tenth part more, which makes altogether almost a third part. For the same measure of honej'^ as of wine contains the weight of the wine and a third part more. Honey is heavier than oil by one half; for it contains the whole weight of the oil, and a half part of the weight besides. Wine exceeds oil by a ninth part, for it contains the whole

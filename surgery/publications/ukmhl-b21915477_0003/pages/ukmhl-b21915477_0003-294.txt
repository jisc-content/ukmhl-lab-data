The wound of operation must be treated antiseptically. The accompanying wood-cuts illustrate two ingenious forms of instrument well suited for the compression treatment of any form of aneurism:— Fig. 448. May’s tourniquet for the treatment of aneurism. A. Pad of pressure. B. Pad of counter-pressure. C. Ball .and socket-joint in the pad of pressure, which is governed by the screw and nut D. E. Key by which, when applied on P, the pads can be approximated or separated. G. Penes trie, by which the pads can be adjusted. H. Strap and buckle. The action of Briddon’s instrument (Fig. 449), is made elastic by running the screws through tense India-rubber bands; it can be tolerated fora long time without producing any annoying complication.

Pressure can be made at two points, the distance between which may be varied according to circumstances, or the instrument may be taken apart, and then a single

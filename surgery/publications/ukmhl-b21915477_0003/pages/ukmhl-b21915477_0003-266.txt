222 INJURIES OF BLOODVESSELS. the promontory of the sacrum, in a farrier, who received a kick from a horse at the level of the umbilicus. The bleeding, which, of course, was internal, proved rapidly fatal. Doubtless other arteries of the abdomen may be rup- tured without external wound. The aorta has occasionally been punctured by foreign bodies which had entered it from the oesophagus. I have already presented two such examples in the section on Punctured Wounds of Arteries. The aorta, too, has not unfrequently been opened by ulcerations caused by foreign bodies penetrating it from the oesophagus. The next four wood-cuts illustrate this accident. Fig. 426. Fig. 427.

(Denonvilliers, Musee Dupuytren.) Taken from Poulet’s Foreign Bodies in Surgical Practice, vol. i. p. 93, Am. ed. Poulet1 has collected thirty-three instances of the perforation of bloodvessels by foreign bodies lodged in the oesophagus. In these cases, however, the perforations were”effected by ulcerations caused by the foreign bodies, that is, the perforations were secondary to eschars, which, by gradually becoming deeper, finally involved the walls ot the vessels. In 17, or over one-half of these 33 cases, the aorta was the vessel per- forated ; in 4 the common carotid artery; in 2 the vena cava ; in 1 the inferior thy- 1 Foreign Bodies in Surgical Practice, vol. i. p. 91, Am. ed.

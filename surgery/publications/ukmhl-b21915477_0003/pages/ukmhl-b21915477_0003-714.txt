INJURIES OF THE JOINTS. 662 injuries to the axillary artery and vein have occurred, especially when forced extension has been made in an upward direction. In some instances, a dislo- cation of the shoulder leaves a permanent deficiency in the capsule, of such a nature that reluxation occurs throughout the remainder of life from very slight causes. Symptoms.—There are several injuries which perplex the general practi- tioner by their resemblance to dislocation of the humerus, so that it is im- portant to have a clear idea of the mechanism and symptoms of this lesion. The proofs of the luxation are these:— (1) Flattening of the Shoulder.—In the natural position, the tuberosity of the humerus stands out laterally beyond the end of the acromion process, giving the deltoid region the beautiful curve so prized by sculptors and pain- ters, and aptly called by the common people of some nations the “ apple of the shoulder.” When the joint is dislocated, the absence of the bone causes the deltoid muscle to fall in, and to present, instead of the proper curve, only a blunt angle, where it leaves the acromion, and to slope downward and out- ward almost in a straight line from its origin to its insertion. If the patient Fig. 556. Subglenoid dislocation of humerus, showing flatness beneath acromion, a, a, tips of acromion processes.

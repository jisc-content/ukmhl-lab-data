241 TRAUMATIC ANEURISM. inasmuch as no atheromatous change is discernible in them, and nothing ap- pears to account for a spontaneous rup- ture, it is believed that they were lace- rated by some traumatic cause. The tumor was recognized by its position and pulsation during the life of the pa- tient, who died of another disease ; but the antecedent history is, unfortunately, not recorded.1 This sort of circum- scribed traumatic aneurism is often pro- duced by blows and strains ; and I have presented a considerable number of ex- amples of it in the foregoing pages. The inner and middle coats of the in- jured artery, on being torn through in this manner, gape open, and the pressure of the blood-stream expands the outer tunic and the sheath into an aneurismal tumor. The other frequent sort of cir- cumscribed traumatic aneurism is illustrated by the following wood- cut (Fig. 439):— It also represents a preparation be- longing to our Army Medical Museum,2 which was obtained from the following case : A soldier, aged 28, received a shot-wound through the right shoulder and walls of the upper part of the tho- rax, implicating also the axillary artery, Fig. 438. Circumscribed traumatic aneurism of tbe superioi mesenteric artery. Fig. 439. Circumscribed traumatic aneurism of the right axillary artery ; ligature of the subclavian performed too late. on June 9, 1863. The external wound appears to have healed without any trouble. Internally, however, an aneurism was developed from the wounded axillary artery in the latter part of the following month (July). On the 28th of that month, “ the true nature of the disease became manifest,” on making a careful examination, “ as the pul- sation of the tumor—at that time about the size of a large horse-chestnut—was very- apparent ; and, upon auscultation, the aneurismal bruit could be distinctly heard, cor- 1 Med. and Surg.

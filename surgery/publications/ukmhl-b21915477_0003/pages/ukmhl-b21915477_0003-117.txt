73 TREATMENT OF HEMORRHAGE BY COMPRESSION. to cause a great deal of pain, and this circumstance has led to the invention of many instruments which act only on the opposite sides of the limb. Among them must be mentioned the tourniquet or artery-compressor bf Professor Gross. (See Fig. 110, Yol. I. p. 567.) In default of the tourniquets already described, an effective instrument for compressing the main artery of the thigh, arm, etc., may be improvised in the following manner:—a pocket-handkerchief, or piece of muslin of cor- responding size, folded into the form of a cravat and knotted in the mid- dle, or containing a pebble placed at the same spot, for a compress, should be tied securely, but rather loosely, about the limb, and then twisted with a stick, a ramrod, or a bayonet, etc., inserted underneath. (Fig. 354.) I have several times known old soldiers to stop hemorrhage for comrades in this way. Fig. 354. Fig. 355. Improvised torsion, or the old soldier’s tourniquet (Esmarch.) Improvised double-stick tourniquet of Vfilkers. (Esmarch.) Comparatively little pressure, however, if exerted by means of a stick against the inner side of the arm, is sufficient to control the circulation in the brachial artery; the muscles may, in this way, be forcibly separated, partly forward, partly backward, and the artery pressed flat against the hu- merus. Volker’s improvised stick tourniquet, which attains this object, may readily be prepared from two stiff shoots or branches of a tree, and two handkerchiefs. (Fig. 355.) The blood-stream in the abdominal aorta can he most securely controlled, if the intestines have been previously emptied, by compressing the aorta

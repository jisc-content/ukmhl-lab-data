528 ANEURISM OF ARCH OF AORTA- the ridge on the distal margin of the hrachio-cephalic trunk is particularly strongly marked, and there is also a smaller ridge in the innominate itself, running from the proximal opening of the left carotid. In two dissections, I have found the left carotid arising altogether from the commencement of the Fig. 547. Arch of aorta and large branches, showing oblique roots of great vessels, and ridges running from orifices on aortic walls. innominate. An aneurism of that vessel, occurring in such a subject, would give rise to some considerable embarrassment of diagnosis, and many doubts as to which point should be chosen as that to which surgical treatment should be directed. For instance, this was evidently the original state of the vessel in the aneurism here depicted ; in the preparation, the peculiar anatomy of the left carotid can be more clearly made out than in the drawing (Fig. 548). How if these conclusions be correct; if there be in the aorta varying rates of current, and if there be districts of that vessel appertaining to the dif- ferent branches, so that the blood which flows over or near any particular portion of its wall must pass into a given vessel, it follows that an aneurism in one situation, if amenable to surgery at all, must be treated from the ves- sels of the right side, while in other situations it must be attacked from the left. Any special resume of cases is impossible: my views were carried out, first, in my own case, aijd have since been followed by Dr. Lediard and Dr. Wyeth; these, as far as I know, are the only three cases in which double distal deligation has been know- ingly undertaken for aortic aneurism. My patient lived fifteen months in fair health and comfort. Dr. Lediard’s lived nearly ten months. Dr. Wyeth’s died one year after the operation, from exhausting diarrhoea. That gentleman writes me : “ Both arteries were obliterated at the points of deligation; they were not divided, but were

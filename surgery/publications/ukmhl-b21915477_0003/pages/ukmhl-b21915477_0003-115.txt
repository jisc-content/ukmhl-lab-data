TREATMENT OF HEMORRHAGE BY COMPRESSION. 71 porarily restrain the flow of blood from recent wounds; but when they are not placed so as to press exactly on the bleeding orifice in the wounded vessel, they often do much harm. Especially is this the case when, from the faulty ad- justment of such compresses, the wounded limb becomes widely infiltrated with extravasated blood. When after a few hours’ delay, in cases where the compresses and ban- dages have been accurately applied, as directed above, we remove the dress- ings in order to tie the artery in the wound, we sometimes find that the aperture in the vessel has become closed by the contraction and retraction of its walls, aided by the formation of occluding coagula, and that the bleeding is permanently arrested. The procurement of the same result is often aided by a moderately-protracted syncope; and provided we keep the patient at rest, with a continuance of the same dressings to the wound, after carefully examining it, and abate all tendency to vascular excitement by giving cool acidulated drinks and an antiphlogistic regimen, we are sometimes grati- fied by finding that a permanent arrest of the hemorrhage has been secured.

Charribre’s screw tourniquet tourniquets have been invented by surgeons to supply its place. Many varie- ties of this instrument are in use. Among the best, as well as the most widely known of them, is that of J. L. Petit. (See Fig. 105, Vol. I. p. 566.) It consists of two brass plates, each set in a frame of brass bars in which rollers turn, a strong thumb-screw to force the plates asunder, a strong strap,

305 DELIGATION OF ARTERIES. Fig. 480. Surgical anatomy of the axillary region (Sedillot.) an inch from the sternal end of the Fig- 481. clavicle, and terminating near the anterior margin of the deltoid muscle’s attachment to that bone, taking care not to cut the cephalic vein. The fibres of the pectoralis major are to he divided in the same direction and to the same extent. The semilunar flap thus formed is then raised, when the pectoralis mi- nor will be seen crossing the inferior part of the wound. The pulsa- tions of the artery can be distinctly felt between the superior margin of this muscle and the clavicle. The axillary vein lies below the artery, but if swollen it may overlap it. One trunk of the brachial plexus of nerves lies above, and in contact with the artery, but the other trunks thereof run behind it. The- artery is isolated by scratching with the finger nail, and passing the needle under it from before backward, and slightly from within outward, avoiding the vein. The point of the needle is guided with the point of the index finger, as it emerges, and is thus kept from taking up any branch of the brachial plexus of nerves. Chamberlaine’s Operation.—Make a transverse incision, three inches in length, through the skin and platysma, along and upon the lower edge of the clavicle, commencing three fingers’ breadth from the sternal end of that bone, and ending about an inch from the acromion process of the scapula. Make a second incision, three inches in length, obliquely through the integuments, over the deltoid and pectoral muscles, meeting the first nearly in the centre.. Remove the cellular membrane and fat. Detach the clavicular portion of the vol. hi.—20 Hodgson’s operation for tying the axillary artery immedi- ately under the clavicle. (Sedillot.)

Pathology.—The lower, front wall of the capsule gives way, its fibres being rather thin at this point, and the head of the femur slips forward along the horizontal ramus of the pubis to the region of the thyroid foramen, lying sometimes just upon it, sometimes above, and sometimes a little below and behind this opening. Mechanism of dislocation into thyroid foramen, showing the Y-ligament suspending the trochanter. The head of the bone lodged in the thyroid foramen, and the trochanter resting on the acetabulum. (Bigelow.) The positions of the head and the trochanter major, in most cases of this variety of luxation, are nearly in the normal plane, so that the neck of the femur points toward the median line, and there is little rotation. When the displacement is more nearly forward, the bone rolls outward to some extent, and when most nearly downward there may even be slight inversion, as in backward dislocation. Symptoms.—Abduction is a constant symptom, and is more marked than in the pubic form of forward dislocation. The foot, as will be inferred from what has been said of the pathological anatomy, does not exhibit a constant tendency to either outward or inward version. Usually it points directly forward, rarely a little inward or outward. In whatever position it lies, it is found to be rigid. As in all the dislocations of the hip, there is some flexion, which cannot be overcome except, seemingly, by tilting the pelvis. This

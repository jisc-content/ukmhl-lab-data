ANEURISM. 530 involved the innominate, and in 9 the aorta, while in 1 the aorta was dilated though not aneurismal; of the whole 33 cases, 17, or more than half, termi- nated fatally, while in 13 decided benefit, of greater or less duration, was experienced. The additional cases referred to by the editor are those of Browne (recovered), Denuce, and Marsh, and the fatal cases of Hutchison, Pollock, and Maury.] It will be observed that in nearly all the cases of the above table which were followed by rapid death, the autopsy revealed disease of the heart, of the aorta, or of both. Therefore, the state of these parts should always be carefully investigated. In the present state of our knowledge, we may not always be able to diagnose atheroma of the aorta, or even a certain degree of dilatation ; but it may often be inferred, though not absolutely made out. At all events, it is well to point out what conditions injuriously affect the death-rate of the operation, which should never be lightly undertaken with- out due knowledge of what to seek, and what circumstances should deter. Consecutive double deligation has usually been employed in consequence of a hope that tying one of its branches would cure an innominate aneurism, the other branch being secured when, after a certain interval, improvement only, and not cure, has resulted. The operation may also, however, be under- taken because the surgeon, intending to tie both vessels,, has reason, from the condition of the heart and aorta, to dread doing so simultaneously.

The result of tying the right carotid alone for innominate aneurism is not to he considered satisfactory, and more especially is it unsuccessful if the disease involve the aorta. The vessel has been ligatured for innominate, or supposed aorto-innominate, disease, thirty times, with twenty deaths. But in cases of aortic, or aorto-innominate disease, the operation has been performed seven times, and in only one instance has it proved beneficial—the case of Mr. Annandale.2 With this exception, the longest survival was forty-one hours; the next, nineteen hours; the others, ten hours and under. The conclusion to be drawn, is, that for low innominate aneurism, which almost always involves the aorta, it is safer to tie both vessels than the carotid alone. Distal ligature of the right subclavian in its third part, for innominate aneu- rism, would not appear a hopeful procedure, since the carotid and so many 1 The patient was greatly relieved of pain, and asked, if it returned, whether the surgeon could not tie some other artery; there were, however, other aneurisms, one of which seems to have burst. 2 The patient survived two years ; the cause of death is unknown, and there was no post-mor- tem examination. (Letter from Mr. Annandale.) I cannot persuade myself that the aneurism was aortic ; the immediate effect of the ligature—stoppage of pulsation—must surely negative such an idea.

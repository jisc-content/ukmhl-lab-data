651 DISLOCATIONS OF THE RIBS. tion beneath the chin. He now presses strongly downwards with his thumbs, and at the same moment uses his fingers to push the chin in an upward di- rection. In this manipulation the thumbs become the fulcrum of a lever, the power being applied by the fingers at the chin, and the work done being Fig. 552. Showing action of external pterygoid muscle (a b d) in dislocation of lower jaw; the dotted line shows the position of the hone when displaced. represented by the depressing of the condyles. When the condyles have been forced down below the level of the articulation, the first step of the operation is finished, and the surgeon then pushes the bone directly back- ward, when the reduction usually will be found complete. In difficult cases, corks may be substituted for the surgeon’s thumbs between the back teeth. Dislocations of the Ribs. Dislocation of the Ribs from the Vertebra;.—Many of the older authors have described instances of dislocation of the ribs from their articulations with the spinal column, but modern criticism has so far impaired the value of this testimony as to render it doubtful whether any of the recorded cases were correctly diagnosed, except one mentioned by Bransby Cooper, who found upon post-mortem examination an ancient dislocation of the seventh rib. During the patient’s life, we have no means of distinguishing costo-vertebral dislocations from fractures of the necks of the ribs, and no method of effect- ing _ reduction if dislocation be present. Hence nothing can be said on the subject of the treatment of this accident. Dislocation of the Ribs from their Cartilages. (Costo-chondral disloca- tion.)—This accident closely simulates fracture of the ribs, and indeed, during

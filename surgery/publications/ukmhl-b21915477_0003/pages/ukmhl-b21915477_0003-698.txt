646 INJURIES OF THE JOINTS. to draw the dislocated member in a direction away from the body, is called the extending force. As this force is often so great that it would drag the patientâ€™s body into a faulty position, a counteracting power is necessary to fix the body by acting in a contrary direction. This is denominated the counter-extending force. The form of apparatus formerly most used to increase the power of exten- sion, was the rope and pulley. The mechanics of this every-day contrivance Fig. 549. for multiplying power are too well understood to need explanation. Pulleys for surgical use do not differ from those made for other purposes. The common two- and three-wheeled blocks of ship-chandlers are equally efficient, though less elegantly constructed. When pulleys are not at command, extemporaneous contrivances can be made to answer a good purpose as means of powerful extension. A con-

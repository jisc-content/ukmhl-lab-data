A square pad, made by folding a roller three inches wide and two yards long, should be placed over the artery to serve as a compress. Upon this the base of the instrument should be laid, its two plates having already been approximated, and the strap should then be carried around the limb and securely buckled. By turning the thumb-screw the artery may be compressed at will. The field tourniquet (Fig. 349) is composed of a strong linen strap, a strong buckle, and a pad ; and is, in substance, the strap and buckle of a Petit’s tourniquet, which are to be used without the frame and screw of that instrument. The tourniquet of Charri&re (Fig. 350) is provided with a pad for making counter-pressure; but, in respect to efficiency, this instrument does not equal the tourniquet of Petit. The well-known firm of Tiemann & Co., surgical instrument makers, have devised a useful tourniquet which bears their name (Fig. 351). In this in- strument the pressure is applied to the Fig. 351. artery by a pad which is projected by r Tiemann & Co.’s tourniquet. a screw. This tourniquet will not easily turn over, nor hinder the circulation of the venous blood. But the constriction of the limb which attends the employment of all tourniquets which act by means of a strap passing around the limb, is liable Fig. 352. Fig. 353. Compression of the brachial artery by a screw tourniquet. (Esmarch.) The tourniquet plate is displaced to show the application of the compress in the line of the artery; the plate is adjusted im- mediately over the compress before the strap is tightened. Compression of the femoral artery by a screw tourniquet. (Esmarch.) The plate of the instru- ment is adjusted over the compress before the strap is tightened.

TREATMENT OE HEMORRHAGE BY AERTERIVERSION. 101 over the first, on the hooks as over a fixed point (rigs. 405 and 406), the inversion of this part of the artery is readily secured.

The peg, when allowed to remain, apparently does no harm. Dr. Weber has operated by this method with success on the femoral, the brachial, and the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, in amputations of the thigh, arm, and leg.1 He claims, from his own experience, that this method of treating arteries is a justifiable proceeding, and that it possesses a decided advantage in leaving scarcely anything but living tissues in the wound. The value of this operation, however, is not yet determined. Medical Record, pp. 308-310. New York, 1875.

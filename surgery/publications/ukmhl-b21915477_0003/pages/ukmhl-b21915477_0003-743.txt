DISLOCATIONS OP THE HIP. 691 brought clown from the bent or flexed position in which the displacement took place, the head of the bone, taking an opposite position by reason of the fulcrum action of the Y ligament, rises upward behind the tendon, which will now wind tightly around the neck of the femur between the head and its socket. It will be seen at once what an insuperable obstacle is- here pre- sented to every effort at reduction, unless some special manipulation can enable Fig. 569. Fig. 570. the head of the bone to evade the tightly-drawn tendon, and reach its socket without resistance. More exact knowledge of the pathology of this particular form of luxation has taught us how to accomplish this, but it is not surprising that until recent years it should have been considered by the best surgeons as practically irreducible. Treatment.—Traction after Cooper’s method should never be employed in this dislocation. When the head and neck of the femur are made to advance toward the acetabulum by simple traction, they are at once arrested by the firm band of the tendon lying between them and their destination. jSTo amount of simple traction can ever suffice to overcome this obstacle, and yet with only slight force, the bone being skilfully guided, all resistance may be avoided, and reduction may be readily secured. Hor are the principles upon which this is to be accomplished difficult to understand and remember, if an accurate picture of the exact condition of parts be once fixed in the mind. Let the surgeon remember, then, that the tendon lies normally across the back of the joint, a little below its level; that the thigh being sharply flexed, the head of the bone has burst its evelopino- capsule and slipped below the tendon; and that it has gone up behind this

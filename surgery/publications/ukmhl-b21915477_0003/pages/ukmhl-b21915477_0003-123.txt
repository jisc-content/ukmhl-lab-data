TREATMENT OF HEMORRHAGE BY LIGATION. 79 Improvised compression of the aorta, with a pad and an elastic roller. (Esmarch.) water, or by applying the induced current to the same, or by compressing the main artery with the fingers, above the wound. (See also Yol. I., page 569.) If small arteries spurt, they must be tied or twisted. Fig. 371. Compression of the abdominal aorta by Brandisâ€™s method. (Esmarch.) The elastic tourniquet of Esmarch, many ways of applying which have been given above, with illustrative figures, is in some respects superior to all other tourniquets, because it can be applied around any part of the limb, and be- cause the location or course of the main arteries need not he considered while putting it on. III. Ligation. The only truly efficacious means of arresting the hemorrhage from wounds involving large arteries, are compression and ligation, as Boyer in substance justly remarks. And the direct or immediate application of a ligature to a wounded vessel is by far the most satisfactory way to stop its bleeding. It affords a feeling of security which is yielded by no other plan of treatment, and enables the surgeon to leave his patient, at whatever distance, feeling, if the artery be sound where it is tied, that there is absolutely no risk of hemorrhage left behind.

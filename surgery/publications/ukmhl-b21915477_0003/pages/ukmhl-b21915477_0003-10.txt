PREFACE. VI a faithful friend, and an honorable, high-minded gentleman, Van Buren worthily represented the best type of American Surgeon. His admirable study of Inflammation—destined to be classical in Surgical Literature—in the First Volume of the Encyclopaedia, was his last contribution to the science of that profession which he loved so well, and of which he had been so long an ornament and most honored member. The Editor feels confident that the present volume will fully sustain the high reputation acquired by its predecessors—translations of which into both the French and Italian languages have already been announced—and that on account both of the importance of the subject matter of its several articles, and of the exhaustive, and at the same time eminently practical manner in which these have been dealt with by their respective authors, it will be received with equally gratifying commendation. The thanks of both the Editor and Pub- lishers are due to the Surgeon-General of the U. S. Army, for his kind and liberal permission to use a number of illustrations from the Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion, as they are also for similar courtesies received from Prof. Esmarch, the late Prof. Sedillot, Prof. Bigelow, and Dr. Weir Mitchell.

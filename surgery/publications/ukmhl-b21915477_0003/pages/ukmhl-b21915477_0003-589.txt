Wound looking well and firmly closed up to the drainage tube, which was removed and replaced by a few strands of catgut. Patient a good deal troubled with tenesmus; enema did not give relief, and he was ordered a mild saline aperient, which was effective; bowels moved twice. Evening temperature 98.4°; pulse 116. 16th. Morning temperature 98.4° ; pulse 132. Mixture of tincture of digitalis in 5 minim doses, and sulphate of quinia in 2 grain doses, every fourth hour. Evening temperature 98.4° ; pulse 116. 17th.

The discharge seems to come from above the apex of flap. Evening temperature 98.8° ; pulse 108. 20th. Morning temperature 98.8° ; pulse 104. Pus small in quantity, quite healthy. Temperature, which has been normal for seven days, rose to 99.6° this evening. He had a good deal of stinging, burning pain in the hand this afternoon. Tumor measured in one diameter 2^ and in the other 2|- inches—showing an altered form, and giving a reduction of one inch in one direction, and of half an inch in the other. Evening tem- perature 99.6°; pulse 108. 21st. Morning temperature 98.6° ; pulse 100. Passed a very quiet night. Sensa- tion good in the arm, but still very imperfect in forearm. Still no radial or temporal pulse. Temperature of arm very good. Swallowing again very painful. Evening temperature 99.6°; pulse 100. 23d. Morning temperature 98.2°; pulse 100. Pain in right eyeball, and occipital headache. Ordered 20 grains of bromide of potassium, which had the effect of relieving him. Pulse fell to 96 in an hour and a half. Pain in right hand, as before, for a short time. In the evening pulse rose to 116, and temperature to 101°. As there was no apparent cause for this, I was sent for, and saw the patient with Mr. Corley. The wound was examined, but nothing could be found there to account for the increased fever. Ordered 20 grains of bromide of potassium, and ice. Deglutition not as difficult as yesterday. 24th. Morning temperature 98.4° ; pulse 108. Passed a good night. Had a pur- gative. Pain in right hand and arm at intervals during the day. Wound healthy. Ordered 1-J grains of quinia in pill, and a mixture containing 20 grains of bromide of potassium, and 1-| fluidrachms of infusion of digitalis three times a day.

Morning temperature 98.4° ; pulse 116. Patient rather depressed this morn- ing, for the first time since the operation. Sinus syringed out with carbolic acid, 1 in 40. A piece of ligature, about two lines long by a line broad, with some shreddy substance, was washed out. This, on subsequent examination under the microscope by Mr. P. S. Abraham, proved to be yellow elastic tissue. Presumably it was one of the cut ends beyond the knot, as it was sharply defined, and under the microscope, at one part, the fibres were suddenly turned upon themselves, as if forming part of the knot. Evening temperature 99.8° ; pulse 120. 27th. Morning temperature 98.8° ; pulse 100. Patient looks very well and passed

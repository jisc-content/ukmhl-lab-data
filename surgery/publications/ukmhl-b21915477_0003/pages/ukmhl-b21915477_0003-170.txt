The point of the bayonet entered the upper part of the left thigh, and passed through the sciatic notch, injuring the sciatic nerve, and wounding the internal pudic artery, whence a false aneurism formed, which became diffused through Fig. 418. The arteries of the pelvis. the whole pelvic cavity, forcing the rectum aside, displacing the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and rendering defecation difficult and painful. The aneurismal cavity held about three quarts of blood.1 The swelling of the thigh and leg resulted from the pressure on the iliac veins that was exerted by the aneurismal swelling. Four exam- ples of shot-wounds involving this artery were also reported.2 The outward bleedings were arrested by plugging the wounds with liquor ferri persulph., and applying com- presses with bandages, but they all terminated fatally. llio-Lumbar Artery.—A soldier, aged 20, received a shot-wound of the right ilium, February 14, 1862. Hemorrhage from the ilio-lumbar artery occurred on March 4, to the amount of thirty ounces, and recurred, at intervals, until the 24th, when death supervened.3 An- other fatal case of bleeding from this vessel is reported.4 There were several large hemorrhages.

CONTRACTURES OF FASCIA3. 25 element of danger, and there must he some probability of cicatricial repro- duction of the flexion. The idea of subcutaneous section of the contracted bands goes hack certainly as far as the time of Sir Astley Coop^T, and many surgeons have put it in practice with more or less satisfactory results. Quite recently Mr. Wm. Adams has very strongly presented the merits of this method of procedure, and has shown that, in his hands at least, it is at once easy, safe, and successful* He directs that a very small, straight-edged knife, smaller than the ordinary tenotome, shall be introduced just above and below where the skin is firmly adherent to the band, and the contracted tissue divided from above down- wards ; and if, as is often the case, these sections are insufficient to com- pletely free the finger, other similar divisions are to he made wherever requiredâ€”as many as, and no more than, will suffice to permit of full and perfect extension of the finger. Absolute rest of the hand and extended fingers is to be secured by the application of a light metallic splint, and the dressing is not to be disturbed until the fourth day. The splint is to be kept on night and day for two or three weeks, and afterwards at night only for three or four weeks longer, movement of the fingers being permitted during the day. Cases thus treated have so completely recovered that but slight traces have remained of either disease or operation, and the functional use of the hand and fingers has become and remained practically perfect.

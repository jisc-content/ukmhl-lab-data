83 TREATMENT OF HEMORRHAGE BY LIGATION. an artery without an assistant, as it will retain its hold, and by its weight will draw the vessel out while the ligature is being applied. Prof. Hamilton's spring-catch fenestrated artery forceps. Among the best of the fenestrated instruments must be reckoned Dr. David Prince’s tenaculum forceps. (Fig. 375.) As its name denotes, the extremity of one of the blades is armed with a long slender tooth capable of piercing the walls of an artery like a tenaculum. The blades themselves are held securely fastened together when closed by pushing a tube down over them. With this instrument also the surgeon can readily take up an artery without an assistant. Fig. 375. Dr. David Prince’s tenaculum forceps For the purpose of separating or detaching the sheath from the artery when about to tie it in a wound, and for many other objects, the plain for- ceps (Fig. 143, Yol. I. p. 578), can be advantageously employed. For ligating deep-seated arteries. Professor H. J. Bigelow has devised a good as well as an ingenious instrument. When the artery has been seized, the operator closes the forceps, and by slightly moving the button forward, he locks the jaws. The ligature is then passed around the blades and par- tially tied. (Fig. 376.) By pressing forward the button the small hook will now expel the loop of the ligature from the blades on to the artery, where- upon the second knot is tied and the forceps removed. Fig. 376. Professor Bigelow’s forceps for tying deep-seated'artpries. For taking hold of meningeal arteries when required during resection of the cranial bones, etc., Professor J. S. Wight, of the Long Island College Hospital, Brooklyn, has invented a good form of forceps. (Fig. 377.) The instru- ment is four inches and three-quarters long. The jaws are curved, about an inch and a half long, and perforated near the ends, so as to introduce a liga- ture for arteries or tumors. It is fastened when closed by a spring catch.

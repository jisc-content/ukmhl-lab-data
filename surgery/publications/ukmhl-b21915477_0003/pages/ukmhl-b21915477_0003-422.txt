374 SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. are never affected. They may or not be stained with pigment. The majority of hairy moles are not colored. Moles, whether simple, hairy, or pigmented, are benign. As a result of irri- tation they may inflame and become ulcerated, or may develop into malignant growths. Carcinomata, especially of the melanotic variety, are frequently described as having resulted from inflamed pigment moles. Alarming hem- orrhage has been known to occur from a mole more than usually vascular, in which ulceration had been established by friction of the clothing. Treatmentâ€”As long as no deformity or inconvenience results from these formations, it is better to let them alone. When situated upon the face, of such size or position that they become offensive to the eye, they may be removed by simple excision. The incision should be elliptical, and well away from the growth, going entirely through the thickness of the skin. The wound should be closed with a delicate suture, orylrawn nicely together with adhe- sive strips. I have removed as many as five from the face of one patient, and without leaving any perceptible trace of their location; and no bad result has ever occurred to my knowledge from this practice. The simplest method of procedure is to produce local anaesthesia by the ether spray, and operate quickly. Port-wine marks, that is, large pigment spots, may also be excised w7hen the surgeon is assured that the resulting cicatrix will be a less defor- mity than the existing mole. If a mole should at any time take on inflammatory action, or give any indication of malignant proliferation, immediate excision would be impera- tive, and the incision should be wide of the supposed area of the disease. The employment of caustics or irritants of any kind is to be deprecated, as they would increase the tendency to malignant change in these growths.

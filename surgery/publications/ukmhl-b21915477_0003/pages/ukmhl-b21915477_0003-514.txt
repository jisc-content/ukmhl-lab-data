466 ANEURISM. altogether 259 examples of deligation of the superficial femoral artery, from the time of Hunter’s first case to 1873. For reasons which will soon appear, I make use of his table only up to the end of 1869. This gives us 230 cases, of which 187 were cured, while 43 were fatal. To these figures 1 am able to add for the additional ten years, 1870 to 1879 inclusive, 67 cases with 10 deaths, making altogether 297 cases with 53 deaths—a mortality percentage of 17.8 in the whole period since Hunter first introduced his ope- ration. Up to 1870, the percentage of deaths was 18.7; since that date, it has been 15.6 ; but we may go further. A large number of the deaths occurred in the first half of the decade from 1870 to 1880, viz., in 32 cases 7 deaths and 2 amputations (the patients surviving)—a death-rate of 21.87; or if we include the amputations under the head of failures, we have the terrible percentage of 28.1. From 1875 to 1879 inclusive, the mortality declines immensely; we have, namely, 35 deligations with 3 deaths and no amputations—a mortality of 8.57 per cent. I have excluded cases of temporary ligature. I fear we must conclude that numbers obtainable by collecting published cases furnish unreliable and far too favorable results. If we turn to the records of the six London hospitals above quoted, we find a very different death-rate. The number of deligations for popliteal aneurism amounts to 52 ; of these only 40 were cured while 12 died—making a death-rate of 23.08—a percentage which is certainly higher than it ought- to be,1 and, I firmly believe, very much higher than in a short time hence it will be, that is to say, when the best form of ligature shall have been determined upon and adopted. This question of the form of ligature is of immense importance; the matter has been already in part discussed, but a few numbers and considera- tions may here be given. Of the 52 hospital cases above quoted, we must subtract 7 in which the sort of ligature is not specified; the other 45 may thus be tabulated according to the sort of ligature:— Substance used. No. of cases. No. of deaths. No. of re- lapses. Percentage of failures. Silk 14 3 1 21.4 Catgut . 27 6 3 26. Ox aorta 4 0 0 0. Under the head silk, the relapsed patient died ; under that of catgut, two of the relapses ended fatally ; thus the numbers overlap. There were in the cases tied with silk 3, in those tied with catgut 7 failures. Causes C Silk, 1 rupture of aneurism at site of ligature ; 1 secondary hemorrhage ; 1 pysemia. of < Catgut, 1 exhaustion and bedsore ;2 1 erysipelas ; 2 secondary hemorrhage ; 2 after re- death. ( tying for relapse or fresh aneurism at site of ligature. If now we consider the ten failures, we find that six, besides one case of relapse in which the patient afterwards got well, were due to the action of the ligature on the coats of the vessel. There would have been no formation of aneurism at the site of ligature, and no secondary hemorrhage, unless the arterial tunics had been damaged. Relapse would have been only an occa- sional cause of failure if the catgut ligatures had not become too rapidly soft. 1 It must he remembered that we are dealing with such small numbers that any infelicity of management affects unduly the whole calculation. Thus in one institution whose number of deligations happens to be large, we find that in more than one-fourth of the cases, relapse with ulceration of the vessel occurred, or a new aneurism formed at the site of the ligature. All but one of the patients died, either with or without retying. As such cases are not noted in any other institution, it seems a necessary conclusion that in this one a fashion prevails of pulling the ligature too tight. 2 The fatal issue in this case was due more to previous prolonged pressure than to ligature.

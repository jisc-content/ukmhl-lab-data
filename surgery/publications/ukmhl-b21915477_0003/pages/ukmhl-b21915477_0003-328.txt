284 INJURIES OF BLOODVESSELS. Fig. 461. Liston’s artery forceps. pair of forceps is also required. One, at least, of the silver probes (Fig. 462) should have a flattened and eyed extremity. Fig. 462. Silver probes. Of artery-needles, among the best is Mott’s “American aneurism needle” (Fig. 437, p. 240), especially for ligaturing deeply seated arteries. It consists of two sections, namely, a straight handle and a curved extremity, the latter of which is screwed on to the former. The curved extremity, or point of the needle, has two eyes; when used, the second eye is threaded with the ligature; the point of the needle is then gently passed under the artery, and, as it emerges on the opposite side, the blunt hook is inserted into the first eye, whereby the point is securely held until the handle is unscrewed, when the point is drawn through with the ligature. There are, however, several forms of artery-needle which may be reckoned as useful instruments; three of them are represented by the accompanying wood-cuts (Figs. 463,464,465). Fig. 463. Syme’s aneurism needle. The curved point of Mott’s artery-needle is sometimes liable to become loosened, and may then turn in the wound while it is being passed around the artery. To obviate this difliculty the instrument represented by Fig. 465 has been devised. The shaft is hollow, and receives a steel rod, having a button-shaped head for convenience in turning it. The lower end of the rod terminates in a male screw, destined to work in a female screw in the upper end of the curved point. The shaft is provided at its lower end with two triangular teeth, and the upper end of the curved point with two correspond-

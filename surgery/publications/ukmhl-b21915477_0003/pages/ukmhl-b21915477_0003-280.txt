Showing the bloodvessels, nerves, and viscera of the pelvis. the casualty.1 Moreover, there are six cases of gunshot wound of the pel- vis reported, in which 4secondary hemorrhage occurred from lesions of the internal iliac artery, between the twelfth and twenty-first days, and death ensued.2 The tunics of the artery in each instance were probably bruised by the missile, and when the disintegrated tissue was separated from the sound tissue by ulceration, the artery was opened, and hemorrhage, ensued. In three cases the internal iliac artery was ligatured on Hunter’s plan to sup- press the hemorrhage from a wounded branch, but without success in every instance.3 In the following case, the inferior hemorrhoidal arteries were wounded by a conoidal musket-ball, and death took place from secondary hemorrhage on the fortieth day:— A soldier, aged 20, wounded May 8, 1862, in the buttocks and rectum, had hemor- rhages several times which were checked by liquor ferri persulph. and opium, until June 16, when hemorrhage again occurred from the bowel, and he died in half an hour. Necroscopy—The ball entered the pelvis at the obturator foramen, passed directly through the rectum, broke off the spinous process of the ischium of the opposite side, and lodged in the fibres of the gluteus medius. The bleeding vessel was one of the inferior hemorrhoidal arteries; the space between the sacrum and rectum was filled with coagula; the recto-vesical fold was elevated, and its peritoneal surface was dark in color.4 i Ibid., p. 331. » Ibid., pp. 330, 331.

(v) PREFACE. The Third Volume of the Encyclopaedia resumes the consideration of the Injuries and Diseases of the Various Tissues of the Human Body, containing separate articles on Injuries and Diseases of the Muscles, Tendons, and Fasciae; on Injuries and Surgical Diseases of the Lymphatics; on Injuries of Bloodvessels; on Surgical Diseases of the Vascular System; on Aneurism; on Injuries and Diseases of the Nerves (including Tetanus); and on Injuries of the Joints. In the three important articles devoted to the Surgery of the Blood- vessel System, there has been, of necessity, some overlapping. Thus, in the consideration of the operations practised upon arteries, Dr. Lidell, as is fitting, has considered these from the point of view of the Army Surgeon, called to treat hemorrhage from a wounded but otherwise normal vessel, while Mr. Barwell has dealt with the subject as it pre- sents itself to the Hospital Surgeon in Civil Practice, who in operating for the cure of aneurism is concerned with arteries which are them- selves diseased, and which are often widely displaced from their natu- ral positions. Each account of the subject is valuable in itself, and each is essential to the unity and completeness of the article in which it appears. In bringing to a conclusion his work upon the Third Volume of the Encyclopedia, the Editor has to lament the death of one of his most distinguished and most valued collaborators, the late Prof. William H. Van Buren, of New York. A wise surgeon, a skilful operator, an accomplished teacher, a learned and elegant writer,

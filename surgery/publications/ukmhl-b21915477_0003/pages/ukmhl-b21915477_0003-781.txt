729 GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF JOINTS. sible.1 Generally, however, the comminution is such that we have no choice except between amputation above the elbow and excision of the joint. In regard to the selection between these two operations, such contradictory opinions have been expressed by eminent authorities, that surgical literature on this point is eminently confusing. This state of affairs can only be accounted for by supposing that many authors of prominence have preferred to form opinions by guesswork, rather than by a laborious sifting of facts. It is necessary, therefore, to discuss the question with some care, in order to reach the solid truth. The following statistics have been gathered with much labor. From the mode of collection adopted by different authors, a part of the cases are undoubtedly included twice, but it is impossible to completely separate them, and as the reduplication includes recoveries and deaths alike, it probably does not materially alter the ratio of mortality— Shot Wounds of the Elbow treated without Operation.

Of 103 gunshot wounds of the knee, only 21 ended in anchylosis. Other statements are equally sur- prising. As these results seem contrary to all experience elsewhere, I hesitate to accept them, and have omitted them from my tables. The figures were probably obtained from the records of surgeons who made out their returns in haste, and reported all injuries of the part as “ wounds of the elbow,” though the bullet had not, in all cases, opened the articulation.

98 INJURIES OF BLOODVESSELS. at the upper end of the instrument. As soon as the screw turns with a considerable degree of resistance, or the inner and middle coats are seen to be sufficiently invaginated, by observing their movements in the open end of the Fig. 396. Showing how the artery is placed within the grasp of the constrictor. artery, the instrument is to he detached from the artery, and the operation is completed. The length of time required for the operation is about one minute, or more, according to the size of the artery. The constrictor applied and closed Fig. 399.

Showing the effects of constriction applied in the continuity of an artery. Professor Hamilton says that, in the experiments on the cadaver which he has made with Dr. Speir’s instrument, he has always found the inner and middle coats of the artery invaginated or recurved enough to completely close the channel, and likewise to resist the flow of water forced in by a Davidson’s syringe. In operating on large arteries, the tongue of the con- strictor must be drawn into the sheath further than is required in operating on small arteries. This is the one point necessary, and to he attended to, in constricting large arteries, namely: a perfect invagination of the inner and middle coats must be secured. This invagination may be made as complete as may be desired, by drawing the artery up into the tube with the hook which grasps it, as far as may be needed to effect the object. The instrument may be made with a stop to indicate when a sufficient invagination has been reached; but experience has shown the touch to be the best guide for the

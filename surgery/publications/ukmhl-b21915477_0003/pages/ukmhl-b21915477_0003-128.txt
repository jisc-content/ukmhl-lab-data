84 INJURIES OF BLOODVESSELS. Fig. 377. Professor Wight’s meningeal artery forceps. Intimately connected with the subject of the ligation of vessels are such in- struments as the artery compressor, invented by Professor Gross. (Fig. 378.) It is designed to control the bleeding from vessels too deeply placed to be reached by the ligature. Fig. 378- The artery and needle forceps of Professor Wight (Fig. 379) has also been successfully employed to produce haemostasis in cases where deeply-placed vessels were wounded. Fig. 379. Professor Wight’s artery and needle forceps. Such instruments as small spring forceps (Fig. 380) and serres-fines (Fig. 381) are often valuable to the surgeon when it is desirable to complete an operation before applying the ligatures.

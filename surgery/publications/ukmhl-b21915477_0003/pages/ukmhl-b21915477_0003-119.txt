75 TREATMENT OF HEMORRHAGE BY COMPRESSION. accomplishing the same end with a clamp. Figs. 362 and 363 show the application of Foulis’s device for effecting the same purpose. The open brass ring for fastening the elastic tube. Elastic tube or ligature drawn tightly round the thigh, and fastened with a brass ring, com- pressing the femoral artery. (Esmarch.) Although it is not strictly within the scope of this article, I will in a few words* describe the process of rendering a limb bloodless by the method of Esmarch, for in this connection it will be of interest to all readers. The member having been covered with oiled silk or varnished paper to prevent soiling of the bandage, an elastic roller is firmly applied to it from the tips of the toes, or fingers, upward, until the site of the proposed operation has been passed; by this means the blood is driven completely out of the vessels. Where the roller ends, an elastic ligature, or tube of India-rubber, is wound with moderately strong traction several times around the limb, compressing the arteries so that no more blood can pass through them; and the ends are fastened together by a hook and chain, or by some other approved method.

WOUNDS OP THE HEART. 11 American Journal Med. Sciences, October, 1879, p. 509. needful rest for a time, instead of labor, no reason appears why this young man should not have in reality recovered. Velpeau mentions the history of a man who was stabbed in the left side. The symptoms which ensued were such that at the time the heart was supposed to have been pierced, Nine years afterward he died from other causes. The autopsy established the truth of the former diagnosis, as the cicatrix of the wound was found in the right auricle as well as in the pericardium.1 Dr. George Fischer2 has collected 452 cases of heart-wound, of which 380 ended in death, and 72 in recovery. Death was immediate in 104 cases, while in 270 it occurred after intervals varying from one hour to nine months. There were 44 punctured wounds with 10 recoveries; 260 punctured and incised wounds with 43 recoveries; 72 gun- shot wounds with 12 recoveries ; 76 contusions and traumatic ruptures with 7 recoveries. In 36, or exactly one-half of the 72 recoveries, the diagnoses were verified by post-mor- tem examinations held long after the original injuries; and this circumstance affords good ground for supposing that the remaining 36 cases were likewise correctly diagnosed: Fischer also notes the relative frequency with which different parts of the heart were wounded. In 123 cases it was the right ventricle ; in 101, the left ventricle ; in 28, the right auricle; in 13, the left auricle; and in 17, the apex of the organ. The right ventricle and the right auricle are wounded much oftener than the left ventricle and the left auricle, because they occupy by far the larger share of the front or the exposed por- tion of the heart; the statistics collected by M. Ollivier and by M. Jamain support Fischer’s conclusions. Additional examples of recovery from wounds of the heart, which have appeared during the last twelve years, may be found reported as follows:— In the London Lancet3 a case is recorded of the removal of a needle from the heart on the ninth day', recovery ensuing. Dr. C. L. Ford4 reports a case of heart-wound from buck-shot, which was successfully treated. In the British and Foreign Medico- Chirurgical Review5 there is related a case of bullet-wound of the heart with recovery ; on the twentieth day the external wound was already healed, and the cicatrix moved synchronously with the systole of the heart. Additional examples of long survival after wounds of the heart, which have been noted during the last twelve years, may be found reported as follows:—- Mr. West,6 in an article on wounds of the heart, gives a summary of twenty cases. In one of them, the patient lived 19 years and 7 months after both ventricles had been wounded with a knife. Dr. P. S. Conner7 reports a case of gunshot wound of the heart, wherein both ventricles and the right auricle were involved, and yet the patient survived 3 years, 2 months and 13 days. Steudener,8 of Halle, is quoted as reporting a case of pistol-shot wound of the heart, with survival for 15 weeks. On autopsy, a cicatrix was found at the apex of the left ventricle, corresponding to the wound of the pericardium ; grains of powder were also found embedded in the substance of the heart. Sir James Fayrer9 mentions a case of bullet-wound of the heart, with survival for 72 days. The missile was found in the apex of the left ventricle. Tillaux is quoted10 as having exhibited at the Socidte de Chirurgie, the heart of a woman who had survived two gunshot wounds for 18 days, one missile lodging in the left ventricle of the heart. Dr. H. W. Boone11 relates a case of gunshot heart-wound, with survival for 13 days. A case of stab-wound of the right ventricle of the heart is reported, in which the patient 1 Traite d’Anat.

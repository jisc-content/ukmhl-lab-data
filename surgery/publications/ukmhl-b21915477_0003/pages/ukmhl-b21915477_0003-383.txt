ATHEROMA AND CALCIFICATION. 339 Fig. 517. Showing calcareous deirenpration of the media. A, intima; o c, media: n, adventitia; n n, calcareous patches. Ulnar artery. Magnified about 60 diameters. (From a specimen prepared by Dr. W. L. Wardwell.) of arteries. The microscopic appearances of primary calcification are well shown in Fig. 518. Cohnheim states that in senile arterial calcification, sometimes the media, sometimes the interna (its outermost layer), is affected, and that in them the lime salts are deposited. Moreover, that this deposit of lime takes place here because these tunics have been subjected to the greatest strain. Fig. 518. Arteritis with primary calcification. Section from human radial artery, showing at B, primary calcification of the media c. A, the intima comparatively unchanged. (Drawn from specimens prepared by Dr. W. L. Wardwell at Cohnheim’s Laboratory. Magnified about 350 diameters.) Weigert1 describes a “hitherto undescribed” process known as coagulation necrosis. Beginning with the theory of Schmidt concerning the coagulation of the blood, in which the white corpuscles play the leading part, he argues that all tissues have the power of spontaneously coagulating, it being neces- sary for such ah occurrence that the cells should die, give up their ferment and 1 Yircliow’s Archiv, Bd. lxxix.

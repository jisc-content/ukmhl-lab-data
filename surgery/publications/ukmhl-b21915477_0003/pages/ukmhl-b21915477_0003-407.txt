The common carotid was tied immediately above the clavicle, the incision being made behind the posterior border of the mastoid muscle. Hemorrhage ceased instantly. The recovery was prompt, and the tumor has entirely disappeared. After ligature of the common trunk the tumor was not removed, but the wound was packed with lint soaked in Monsel’s solution.

Or Fig. 511. Endarteritis obliterans, not syphilitic. Transverse section of the basilar; A, muscular layer ; B, elastic layer. The lumen of the artery is entirely filled with a new formation, which has become canalized by new vessels at tup; c, blood pigment; e, hyaline material, part of the new formation encroaching on the media at e, and seen elsewhere. (Drawn by Dr. W. L. Wardwell, from a specimen borrowed from Professor W. H. Welch. Magnified 60 diameters.) Fig. 512. Traumatic endarteritis. Section from the common carotid of a horse, tied with a broad nerve-ligature, showing at b B the proliferation of the intima. The inflammatory new formation is projected into the lumen of the vessel, and has caused partial atrophy of the media, c ; A b, the intima ; b b, portion of the intima in the grasp of the ligature ; i>, the adventitia, slightly changed, with small-cell infiltration. (Drawn by Dr. W. L. Wardwell, from the authorâ€™s specimen. Magnified about 40 diameters.) septic matter may pass into the vessel from the surrounding, inflamed tissue, and lead to infarction and pyaemia. The same condition may result from

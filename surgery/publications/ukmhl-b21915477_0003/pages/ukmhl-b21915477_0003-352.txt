INJURIES OF BLOODVESSELS. 308 centimetres (about 1J inches) in length, and 5 millimetres (a fifth of an inch) to the inner side of the tendon of the biceps; carefully, so as not to injure the median vein, which is drawn downward (Fig. 486). The bicipital fascia Fig. 485. Fig. 486. Ligation of the brachial artery in the middle of the arm. Ligation of the brachial artery at the elbow. (Sedillot,) (Sedillot.) is divided. Immediately beneath it is the artery, lying on the brachialis anticus muscle, and between the vense comites. The median nerve lies a few millimetres inward, and passes beneath the pronator radii teres (Esmarch). Ligation of the Radial Artery.—Although the radial artery is smaller than the ulnar, it.directly continues the course of the brachial artery, and runs in a line drawn from the middle of the bend at the elbow to the inner side of the styloid process of the radius. It is superficial in nearly all its course. The radial nerve lies on its outer or radial side. It has two vense comites. Operation in the Upper Third.—Having extended the arm in a supine position, and having raised the superficial veins by compressing them above, make an incision through the skin and superficial fascia, two inches in length, along the inner margin of the supinator longus, if this is recognized, or in the line just indicated. Raise the deep fascia on a grooved director, and divide it. Flex the forearm somewhat, to relax the muscles; then, drawing the supinator longus aside, the sheath of the artery is exposed. Pass the needle from with- out inward (Fig. 487). Fig. 487. Operation in the Lower Third.—Here the artery lies very superficial, be- tween the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis, and its pulsations are very distinct. The forearm being supine and the hand forcibly extended, to show the flexor tendon, make a light incision, two inches in length, on the radial side of the flexor carpi radialis tendon. Cautiously

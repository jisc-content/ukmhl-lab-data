677 DISLOCATIONS AT THE WRIST. very without anchylosis, but this must always he exceptional. Amputation is seldom or never called for in these cases, but primary excision of the joint will often be the best course. This must depend upon the amount of injury which has been done to the bony structures, to a great extent, but somewhat on the extent of laceration of the soft parts as well. Dislocations at the Wrist. Dislocation op the Carpus.â€”The older surgeons considered this accident -extremely common; but modern investigations of the fractures at the lower end of the radius, have shown dislocation to be much less frequent than was once supposed. These luxations occur either backward or forward. The backward dislocation is produced by violent flexing of the hand,.or by blows or falls on the back of the hand while it is thus flexed. The carpus Fig. 561. Backward dislocation of carpus. is forced upward and backward upon the radius and ulna, while the latter make a large prominence in front of the wrist. Fracture of the rim of the joint often accompanies this injury. The chief danger in diagnosis is in confounding this luxation with fracture of the lower end of the radius. The mobility of the styloid process, even if crepitus be wanting, will usually Fig. 562. make the differential diagnosis absolute. Where the radius is broken ob- liquely, so as to leave the styloid process attached to the shaft, the diagnosis must rest largely upon the presence of crepitus. The forward dislocation presents a great prominence of the bones of the

TREATMENT OF HEMORRHAGE BY COMPRESSION. 77 Fig. 364. Nicaise’s elastic belt for compressing the arteries of the extremities, and thus re- straining traumatic hemorrhage. (Esmarch.) Fig. 365 Nicaise’s elastic belt applied to the arm for com- pressing the brachial artery. (Esmarch.) and may then be energetically pressed down upon that vessel by several figure- of-eight turns of a strong India-rubber roller bandage. (Fig. 369.) Should there be no abdominal tourniquet at hand, a pad may be improvised in the following manner:—A strong linen bandage about eight yards long and four inches broad, is wound around the middle of a stick about a foot long, and having the thickness of a thumb. This pad is placed just below the umbilicus, and is kept in position by an assistant. It should then be pressed with considerable force against the spinal column by many turns of an elastic bandage, four inches in width, each of which is wound around the body at the loins. (Fig. 370.) But if circular compression of the abdomen he undesirable, the linen band- age should be wound around the middle of a stick long enough to have its ends embraced by the turns of an elastic bandage, which is passed under- neath the operating table. (Brandis’s method, Fig. 371.) Whenever necessary, one or even both extremities may he kept bloodless for several hours without injury. At the conclusion of an operation in which the elastic ligature has been em- ployed, the ligature itself must not be slowly loosened, but be quickly taken off from the limb. The consecutive hemorrhage is generally considerable, because the walls of the bloodvessels are temporarily paralyzed. The hemorrhage must, therefore, be provided against, before removing the elastic ligature, either

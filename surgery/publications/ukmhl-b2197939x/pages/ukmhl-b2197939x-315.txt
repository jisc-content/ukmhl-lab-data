APPENDIX. 295 G. Us& of the Cystoscope. It is well to ascertain some time before the examination that the lu-eihra is not contracted. If necessai-y bougies should be passed. The patient should drink at least half a pint of water or weak tea half an hour before the examination, to ensure a free flow of urine from the ureters. The bladder should be washed out if pus or blood be present. In men it is generally advisable to instil a few drops of 20 per cent, solution of cocaine into the prostatic urethra a few minutes before the examination. Adrenalin chloride may be of use in several ways. Thus, 20 to 30 drops of the i-iooo solution instilled into the membranous and prostatic vu-ethra will check the bleeding which is sometimes set up by the passage of the instrument; if there is oozing from the bladder wall so as to obscure the field of vision, filling the interior of the bladder WTth a weak solution of adrenalin for a few minutes generally enables the examination to be made without difficulty. Bleeding into the ' bladder in spite of the adrenalin probably comes from the kidney. The cystoscope should be tested before use. By looking through the tube in daylight objects should be quite distinct at distances of from J< to 2 inches from the prism. Whatever battery is employed (see p. 193), the current should be gradually turned on (the cystoscope being immersed in fluid) to a little beyond the point when the glow prevents the eye from recognising the threads of the lamp. Thus, besides the cystoscope and battery, we should have readyâ€” (1) Soft catheter, warm boric lotion, and funnel or syringe for washing out the bladder (see p. g). (2) Acorn-headed catheter (the same catheter as was used for washing out will suffice if the acorn-headed kind is not available) and small syringe for instilling cocaine or adrenalin solution. (3) Bottles of adrenalin solution and of 20 per cent, cocaine solution. (4) Glycerine as a lubricant.

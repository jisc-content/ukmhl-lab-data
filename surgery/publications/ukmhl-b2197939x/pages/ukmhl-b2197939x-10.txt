PREFACE TO FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS. In complying with the wish of the Publishers to write the foUowing Manual, the Authors have endeavoured to make it as practical, and as thoroughly in keeping with modern surgical methods, as possible. They hope that it may prove a convenient and ready help to those engaged in active surgical work. The illustrations have been mainly taken from drawings from nature by W. Scott, M.B.; figures 5, 7, 8, 94, 122, 123, 129, 130, 133, are from Porter's "Surgeon's Pocket-Book," and figures 178-184 from Landois and Stirling's "Text- Book of Physiology." Their best thanks are due to Professor Tait, who has kindly revised the chapter on Electricity, and to J. H. A. Laing, M.B., who has given valuable assistance in preparing the drawings illustrating Massage. In conclusion, there only remains to say, that, while both Authors share the responsibility of the whole book, each has chosen certain departments. Thus, F. M. Caird has undertaken Chapters III., IV., XL, to XVII. in- clusive, and XXVIII., and G W. Cathcart the remainder Edinburgh, March, 1889.

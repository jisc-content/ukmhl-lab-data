A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. 154 the ligamentum patellse also begins to contract and aid in the separa- tion of the lower fragment. (a.) First Method—by Weight and Pulley. Materials.—posterior splint with a foot-piece—a Macintyre—will suit; Domet bandages; a piece of diachylon-plaster, large enough to cover the anterior and lateral aspect of the thigh, and cut away in a horse-shoe form so as to fit the patellar region (to the horns of the shoe extension-tapes should be fixed); weight and pulley; wire cradle. Treatment.—Bandage the foot and leg, apply the plaster, and carry the bandage up over it, excluding the knee and extension-tapes. Lay the limb extended on the posterior splint, and incorporate both with a bandage. Swing the limb on the cradle, raising the foot.

An ice-bag, or elastic pressure exercised through the medium of a mass of cotton-wool, will also aid in preventing effusion; but, as a rule, this is not required when the case is seen early. Fig. 112.—Fracture of the Patella, treated by the application of two pieces of plaster with elastic bands attached, so that both fragments of the bone are approximated and acted on. The bandage which secures the plaster has not been represented. (h.) Second Method—by Elastic Tubing.—In place of using the weight and pulley, some surgeons attach the two extremities of a

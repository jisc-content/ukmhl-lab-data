Condition on Examination (June sth, 1890).-The patient is a thin, fair, and delicate looking young woman, with a weary, tired expression. She is confined to bed, or the sofa, but can walk a few steps with the aid of a stick and the support of a friend Affected Part.-She complains of little or no pain when the limb is at rest. On Inspectwn.-Th^ right leg is partly flexed, and lies on its outer side. The knee is greatly swollen, especially at the inner side and round the patella, and measures 2 inches more in circumference than the left. The swelling is not abruptly marked off, and is accompanied by no discolouration. One or two scars, the result of some irritating application, are seen over the joint. The thigh and calf muscles are greatly atrophied as compared with those of the other side. On Palpation.—The: temperature of the right knee is felt to be raised above that of the adjacent parts of the limb and of the opposite knee. There is tenderness on pressure all over, especially opposite the internal semi-lunar cartilage and over the outer tuber- osity of the tibia. The swelling is soft and elastic but without any definite fluctuation. The patella is fixed, and the joint cannot be flexed or extended for more than about twenty degrees without much pain. Distinct lateral movement can be produced, although it is accompanied by considerable pain. Respiratory System.—She has no cough, but over the apex of the left lung there is some dulness on percussion, and prolonged expiration on auscultation, which gives rise to a suspicion of com- mencing phthisis ; otherwise normal.

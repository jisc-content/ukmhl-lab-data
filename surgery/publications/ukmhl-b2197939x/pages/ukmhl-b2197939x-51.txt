ANTISEPTICS AND WOUND TREATMENT. 31 and boracic acid is not strong enough for bad cases. The fluid should be renewed daily, and every three or four hours part of it may be replaced by hot lotion, as the bath cools. The patient's head and shoulders must be propped up in bed. The bath (Fig. 4) may either rest upon the bed, or be supported alongside the bed, on a slightly lower level than the mattress. Fig. 4.—Arm Bath. On the third or fourth day, or even sooner, the limb may be safely withdrawn from the bath, and treated with ordinary antiseptic dressings. If the patient is unable to sleep owing to the constrained position entailed by the bath, after the first 24 hours it may be used only by day, while at night the limb is wrapped in cloths soaked in the' lotion. The bath is, however, more efficient than the soaked cloths, and in bad cases should be kept up if possible. The best form of bath is that shown in the figure. It is made of enamelled iron, and can be had of any large ironmonger. Many limbs and lives may be saved by this treatment which, without it, would be lost. The difficulties involved in immersing the foot or leg in a bath (Fig. 5) are greater than those met with in immersing the upper limb. A very large metal leg-boot has also been made for this purpose, and might prove of service. Only the parts below the knee, however, could thus be immersed. The leg would require to be fle.xed at the thigh, with the knee raised, or the bath may be supported beside the bed, and the foot allowed to hang over the side of the bed into it. In Vienna, bad cases of burn to the trunk have been treated by continuous immersion of the whole body. Antiseptic "poultices" or irrigation with antiseptic lotions may Fig. 5.—Foot Bath. be employed where the bath is not availafele. In irrigating, a cloth is laid over the wound, and from a bottle suspended over the part a constant drip takes place by means of worsted threads which

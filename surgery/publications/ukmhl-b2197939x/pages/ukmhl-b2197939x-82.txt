The thread in the nose and that in the mouth are then to be tied together over a pad of lint to prevent the thread from cutting. For passing the thread through the nostril, a Belloc's sound may be used ; but an equally good way is to make the silk fast to the end of a gum elastic catheter, which can be easily passed from the nostril into the pharynx ; when there either it or the thread may be Fig. 28.—Belloc's Sound. Plugging the Posterior Nares. drawn with forceps through the mouth. As soon as the silk is secured, the catheter may be wnthdrawn (Fig. 28). In bad cases, the posterior plug may be left in position for twenty- four to thirty-six hours, then it should be carefully withdrawn by the thread left in the mouth. (2) Troublesome bleeding from the rectum may occur from ulcer- ation into varicose veins, or may follow the removal of internal piles. It may be either arterial, venous, or capillary, and is difficult to stop—chiefly because the sphincter prevents ready access to the bleeding point. Should the bleeding continue after the removal of clots and injection of hot water, apply cocaine and use a speculum. If the vessel can be seen, it may be stopped by the application of a strong styptic. Should this fail, give chloroform; stretch the sphincter, and pull down the affected mucous membrane ; search for the bleeding point and tie it. Digital pressure may be employed ;

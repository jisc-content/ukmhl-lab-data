Objects aimed at in Massage.—These effects of massage are applied— 1. To stimulate the circulation locally or generally; increase metabolism, and encourage nutrition, whether in the skin, in glan- dular organs such as those of digestion, in special groups of muscles, or in the body as a whole. Also to equalise the circulation, and draw blood away from congested areas {e.g., shampooing to induced sleep). Eccles* points out that light friction of the skin increases the pulse rate, probably through the agency of the nervous system ; while deep muscular shampooing generally slows the pulse, probably by dilating the vessels in the muscles. 2. By exciting molecular changes to remove certain neuralgias, e.g., some forms of sciatica, and myalgias of the recent rheumatic or lumbago type. Fig. 136.—Pressure—Rapid Lateral Movements. Fig. 137.—" Hacking." Although an almost endless number of methods of manipulation have been advocated, the chief ones only need be described here. The Movements employed.—The simplest subdivision of the movements is that adopted by Schreiber, who classifies them as "stabile" and "labile." Under the first he includes pressing, tapping (or beating), hacking, pinching, and concussing; under the second, stroking, rubbing, and kneading. (a.) Stabile Movements.—(i) " Pressing" may be done with the tip of one or more fingers, with their phalanges (especially 2nd), or with the knuckles. The simple pressure may be modified by lateral or rotatory movements, or by passing into a rubbing or kneading movement. The amount of pressure employed will vary with the depth to be reached, and the object to be attained (Fig. 136). (2) " Tapping, thrusting, hacking" (i.e., " Tapotement") indicate sudden effects produced more or less forcibly. " Tapping" is done • The Practice of Massaet.

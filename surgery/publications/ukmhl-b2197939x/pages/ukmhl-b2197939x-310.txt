APPENDIX. Sawdust Bags as an Antiseptic Dressing.—Drs. A. and E. Neve, of Cashmir, have used bags of sawdust for many years in their extensive surgical practice. They are pupils of Lister, and thorough anti- septicians. As adapted to this country, the following method has been used with much succe-ss in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. The bags are made of opened bleach gauze, such as is used for swabs, and are in three convenient sizes—4 x 6 inches, 6x8 inches, and 10 x 12 inches, or thereabouts :— The sawdust should be of pine wood, the softer the better, so as to •'et absorption into the wood as well as between the particles. The coarse fragments are first removed by means of a sieve. The bags are partially filled {i.e., so that they may adapt themselves easily), and stitched up by a convalescent patient or a nurse. They are then sterilised by steam, and removed from the "kettle" or packet by the surgeon when the wound is being dressed. The sawdust diffuses the discharge better than absorbent wool, or, in fact, than any other dressing with which we are acquainted. Its cheapness is self-evident. The objections to it are its bulkiness and weight in certain positions. In most instances, however, these qualities are an advantage in causing the dressing to act as a splint. A layer of bicyanide gauze is laid next the wound; then the bags are fitted in position, and secured with a bandage. The preliminary soaking in corrosive sublimate recommended by Dr. Neve is probably unnecessary, because the mercuric salt will be decomposed by the sterilisation in steam. The risks of discharge soaking beyond the aseptic area would certainly be much less with sawdust than with cotton wool.

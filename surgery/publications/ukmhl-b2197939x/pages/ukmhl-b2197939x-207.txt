applied directly to the injured area. The time at which these stages in the process will be carried out will vary with the seventy of the injur)- and the skill and judgment of the masseur. Some also advise the promotion of absorption of other forms of synovial distention in the same way. (5) In Fractures.â€”Thtre can be no doubt that recovery after almost all fractures will be much hastened by massage. The splints where the nature of the case requires them should be carefully taken down every 2 or 3 days ; the hmb, which must be steadied, should then be bathed with hot and cold water alternately and a method similar to that recommended for sprains be put into action. By this means not only is the swelling rapidly reduced, and the nutrition of the muscles maintained, but also the stagnation of the circulation, due to the splints and their fixation, is greatly obviated, and the healing process is encouraged. Union of the broken bone and a return of the function of the limb generally, are thus simultaneously hastened. The massaging process must not cause pain (Lucas Championierre).

A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. tubules, or of the more or less altered epithelial lining of the tubules, still holding together and shed as a whole. The recognised varieties are, epithelial (Fig. i88), opaque granular (Fig. 189), transparent or waxy, fatty, and blood-casts (Fig. 187). As several varieties may occur together in the same urine, conclusions must be cautiously drawn from the prevailing types, rather than from individual specimens, and only after repeated examination. With these precautions and with the patient's previous history in view, Roberts says that "the following conclusions are generally warranted:—(a.) Epithelial casts and blood-casts indicate a disease of recent origin, lb.) Transparent large waxy casts, mi.Ked with dark granular casts, indicate a chronic disease, (c.) Epithelium and casts containing much fat, indicate fatty degeneration." ■Fig. 187.—Blood-cast; Fig. 188.—Epithelial casts. Fig. 189.—Finely altered corpuscles granular casts, lying near it. (Figs. 187-189 from Landois and Stirling's Physiology) These tube-casts are generally present in albuminous urine, and take a long time to settle. Twelve hours should be allowed. The methods indicated before for collecting deposit should be adopted, and are specially necessary. (3) Pus Cells can be recognised under the microscope in urine without much trouble. When in large quantity their presence may be inferred from the naked eye appearances alone. (4) Blood- Corpuscles are not quite so easily recognised, owing to their liability to alteration (Fig. 187).

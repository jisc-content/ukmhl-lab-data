EXTEMPORARY APPLIANCES. 177 If the clavicle be broken, all that is needed is to support the elbow well by an extemporary sling, and bind the arm to the side. Should the handkerchief round the neck press upon the broken bone, the two ends of handkerchiefs must be knotted together. One handkerchief is then placed over the sound shoulder, while the other, spread out, and passing below the elbow of the injured side, is carried to the back to be fastened there to the free end of the first handkerchief. A fractured Icnuer jaw requires to be supported by pressure from below against the upper jaw. A handkerchief round the chin will be found sufficient. C. Bleeding Wounds.— In the extemporary treatment of bleeding wounds, whether with or without a fracture, there are three objects to be kept in view, viz.:—(i) Stopping the bleeding; (2) Covering up the wound; (3) Fixing the part to ensure rest. The first and second indications may often be combined by fixing a firm pad over the wound. As dry absorbent wool charged with an antiseptic is not likely to be avail- able, any clean dry piece of cloth may be used instead.

Tracheotomy is rendered necessary whenever death threatens from laryngeal obstruction which is not at once amenable to other treatment. Eequisites for Tracheotomy. — Chloroform; gauze-pads for sponging ; ligatures ; scalpel ; dissecting-forceps ; Pean or other compression forceps ; sharp hook ; director ; aneurism needle ; scissors; bone forceps (small); syringe with red-rub'jer catheter attached to suck fluid out of the trachea, feathers, and tracheotomy tubes. For uncomplicated cases the usual forms are sufficient. Fig- 33-—R. W. Parker's Tracheotomy Tube ; a, outer, b, inner. Durham's pattern is invaluable when the trachea lies deep in the midst of greatly swollen tissues (Fig. 36). The angled tubes of R. W. Parker 'g- 35)' are preferred on anatomical grounds, but the inner tube is liable to become bent at the cut away portion, and so to jam; moreover, thick mucus is apt to cake at the same point in the outer tube. The small flange for securing the inner tube had better be removed, when good nursing cannot be had, in case it should prevent the tube from being easily removed if blocked. The surgeon generally enters the trachea above the isthmus of the thyroid gland. This is known as the " high " operation. It is more easily accomplished than the operation below the level of the isthmus, 7 A. Tracheotomy.

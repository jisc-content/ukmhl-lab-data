Thomas. He used instead between the bars two pieces of leather, each about 2^ inches wide. One is placed so as to support the back of the calf, while the other comes behind the lower end of the thigh. After the splint has been placed in position with the ring encircling the thigh at the groin, the limb is fixed to it at two points only—i.e., just above and just below the knee. A well- padded shield of block tin or zinc is laid over the limb at these points, and is then fastened backwards by a loop of bandage, which passes round the vertical bars on each side. The shield is per- forated in two places to allow the bandage to pass through it (Fig. 157)- BARS b Fig. 157. —Diagrams to illustrate Thomas's latest mode of fixing his Knee-splint—a. Side view showing the position of the shields in front and leather straps behind (after TJwnias). b. Sectional view showing how the shields are fastened. The splint is prevented from slipping down by a strap and buckle over the opposite shoulder. If the knee be bent when the Thomas knee-splint is being at first used, and if it be thought advisable to overcome the deformity directly, the posterior piece of leather behind the knee might be omitted. The anterior pressure strap above and below the knee would be gradually tightened till the leg became straight. In attempting this, however, it must be remembered that the tibia

all at the outside, and generally less. The sitting, which should only last for from ten to twenty minutes, may be repeated daily, or once or twice a week, according to circumstances. Motor Points.—Duchenne, followed by Erb and others, has shown that on the skin over all superficial muscles there exists a special spot which yields the maximum of contraction, when an electrode conveying a given current is applied to it. These spots are called the ''motor points" of those muscles, which respond to the stimulus thus applied. They should always be utilised in the application of electricity to muscles.* Mode of Application.—For the galvanic current, one electrode, of large size, and for preference the anode (positive), should be placed against the patient's sternum or back, whilst the other electrode is pressed against the part to be stimulated. The size of the latter electrode will vary according to the concentration of stimulus re- quired : thus, a single fine nerve, on the motor point of a small muscle, will require a small electrode firmly pressed down, and larger areas will need larger electrodes, but somewhat stronger currents. For the faradic current, one electrode (either will do) is usually placed over the main nerve supplying the muscle, while the other is applied over its motor point. Electrolysis is the term applied to the decomposition of water, or other fluid or soft solid medium, by the passage through it of a strong current of electricity. The medium decomposed is known as the electrolyte, and when this happens to be water, hydrogen gas is found to gather round the negative pole, and oxygen round the positive pole. When the electrolyte is an organic fimd, such as blood, small quantities of strong alkali are found round the negative pole, and small quantities of strong acid round the positive pole. These minute quantities of acids and alkahes produce their characteristic effects upon the tissues, but have never been found carried into the general circulation. . It is to this their local action, especially that of the negative po e, that T. Duncan attributes the benefit of electrolysis for vascular tumours and goitre, while the destructive effect of the negative pole has also been recommended for the dissoluUon of urethral and other The cases in ordinary practice, for which (accordmg to J. Duncan) electrolysis is best suited, are—subcutaneous nsevi on exposed parts of the body, where therefore a scar is undesirable, cirsoid aneurisms, and intra-thoiacic sacculated aneurisms not amenable to other treat- ment. The same authority has also obtained good results in many cases of goitre. , The methods employed are similar in the above cases.

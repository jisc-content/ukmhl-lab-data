296 APPENDIX. Appendix H. Preservation of Pathological Specimens with Natural Colour Retained.—The method of lores which is a modification of that introduced by Melnikow Raswedenkow has been tested by T. Shennan, in Edinburgh, and has given most excellent results. Solutions required:— (1) Sodium Chloride, i part. Magnes. Sulphate, 2 parts. Sodium Sulphate, 2 ,, Water, 100 ,, (2) Formalin as sold {i.e., a saturated solution of Formalde- hyde gas (40 per cent.) in water. A. is a 5 per cent, solution of (2) in (1). B. Methylated spirit—i.e., about 94 per cent, alcohol and water. C. Equal parts of glycerine and water. First wash all free blood and blood clot from the specimen, then, if possible, cut specimen into slices of about i inches thick, and steep in solution A for 48 hours (according to size of specimen 24 to 36 hours), change the solution if it gets turbid. The specimen at this stage will be blanched. Now lay it in a dish or plate and pour B over it to wash off A, but no water must be used. Next steep specimen in B till the colour returns, this will take about 24 hours; to prolong the stay in spirit only bleaches the specimen again. Transfer into C, in which the specimen will float until the spirit is replaced by the glycerine. After 2 or 3 weeks mount in a fresh supply of C and seal down. Before the permanent mounting it is sometimes an advantage to take a thin slice off the surface of the section—a brighter colour and better differentiation of Darts are thus obtained.

2IO gave no reason for these directions. The upper ring is set by the blacksmith at an angle of 120° with the inner stem (Fig. 155). The padding is made thicker on the inside than on the outside of the ring, but the angle has been fixed upon to allow of this. Jones now recommends the unsymmetrical ring for all cases; he describes the slope between the plane of the ring and the inner bar as forming an angle of 135°, and advises also an antero-posterior slope, so that the ischial bulge of the ring forms its lowest point.

If looked at from the inner side the anterior part of the ring would thus be set at an angle of 145° with the anterior surface of the inner bar. fixtm; the Splint in Position.—Tht long leather apron between the vertical bars for the limb to rest on, and the method of fixing the limb to the splint with a bandage, had latterly been given up by

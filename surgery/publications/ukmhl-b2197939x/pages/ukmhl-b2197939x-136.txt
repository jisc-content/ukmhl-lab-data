Ii6 A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. (4) Spica of the Groin—(a. Suitable Jar Inguinal Hernia.—To form the first loop (Fig. 46), lay the tail over the external abdominal ring of the ruptured side, and carry the roller upwards and outwards around the pelvis, midway between the great trochanter and the crest of the ilium back to the starting-point, where it crosses the tail. To form the second loop carry the bandage over the outer aspect of the thigh round into the perinseum, and back to the starting-point again. In this way a series of crossings are pro- duced, each higher than the preceding one, with which we may exert pressure all along the line of the inguinal canal. Beneath each crossing a small flat compress of lint may be laid so as to aflbrd sufficient pressure. {b.) For Femoral Hernia (Fig. 47). — Lay the tail over the saphenous opening, and carry the roller over the symphysis and round the pelvis at the same level as before. As the first loop is completed, the bandage is next passed downwards into the perinseum and outwards round Fig. 46.—Spica of the Groin —Ascending Form. pig_ —Spica of the Groin— Descending Form.

It will be observed that, as regards he successive^crossingl the line of support in each case agrees with the

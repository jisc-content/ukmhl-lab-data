When this fracture has taken place, the styloids are on the same level, whereas, in the nonnal limb that of the radius is always much more prolonged downwards. In the absence of this symptom and of all typical displacement, it is advisable to treat as CoUes' fracture the cases where marked tenderness on pressure exists, distinctly localised, just above the wrist, and associated with a history of a fall on the palm. Treatment.—TVe^ great essential of treatment is careful and accurate setting. FoUowing this, early passive motion is equally necessary. Special splints present no advantages. Reduction should be carried out at once, and with thoroughness, giving an anesthetic, if needful. By using powerful extension and counter- extension, and flexing the wrist over the knee in cases of jreat difficulty, the fragment is restored to. its normal position It sho^«s no great tendency to become agam displaced. ^/^dded Gooch splints are then applied. The dorsal reaches to the knuckles, the anterior to the palmar flexure {see Fig. 98). . The bandage may fnclude the fingers for the first week. After this date, da. y pass.ve motion of the fingers should be carried out, and every third d^y the splints may be removed, the fracture fixed, he wnst genUy moved.

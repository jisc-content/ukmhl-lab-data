When com- mand of the shorter flexed fragment cannot be ob- tained, the inclined plane, with or without exten- sion, is indicated. (f.) Fracture of the Femur in Children.—It is noteworthy, as stated before, that in children fractures of the femur are more frequently met with than fractures of the leg- bones; they are usually more or less transverse. Children are not easily kept quiet or dry, and therefore treatment is complicated by two con- ditions, imrest and mois- ture. We meet these difficulties by using the double long splint, or vertical extension (Figs. 109 and 110). The double long splint is, and in cases of ununited fracture. It may be used with or without exten- sion. (3) Fractures of the Patella are in most respects comparable with fractures of the ole- cranon. In transverse fractures, there is marked separation of the frag- ments. The upper one is specially displaced by the action of the power- ful quadriceps extensor, and in addition by the filling of the synovial pouch of the joint with exudations and blood- clot.

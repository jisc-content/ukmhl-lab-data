A SURGICAL handbook: 10 process is repeated until the returning fluid is clear. Foulis has introduced a simple and cheap form of douche, although any other form of douche may be used (Fig. i). He attaches a stopcock to the lower part of a common-handled mug, holding a pint. The simplest method of washing out the bladder is to connect a small glass or metal funnel with the catheter in the bladder by means of 3 or 4 feet of rubber tubing. The tubing is flushed to warm it and drive out air, and is then clamped while the connection is being made. The funnel is raised about 2 feet above the bed while the fluid runs into the bladder. When sufficient has entered, the funnel is rapidly lowered to a pail below the bed to syphon out the fluid. This is repeated till the fluid returns clear. In washing out the bladder in women, Burn Murdoch's plan seems the Fig. I.—Washing out the Bladder. Foulis' Method. best. The patient's hips are brought well to the edge of the bed, while her body lies obliquely across it. If the lower parts of the labia majora be now separated the orifice of the urethra can be seen and the catheter inserted, with very little idea of exposure to the patient. The bladder is then washed out. [e.) Operations on the Mouth or Jaws.—After extensive opera- tions in this region, the diflSculty of feeding the patient may be considerable.

A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. 156 Treatment.—Roll the splints in the two ends of the largest towel, and, fitting them on the sound limb, leave sufficient space for it between the splints. Raise the broken leg, and set the fracture, sUp the splints underneath the limb; raise the two sides of the box, and retain them in position with the hands. It is now an easy matter to insert pads where necessary, especially above the malleoli, under the tendo Achillis and near the knee. The two smaller towels are next folded so as to equal in length rather more than half the anterior aspect of the leg. They are then laid over the shin-bone, and all is secured by the three slip-knots (Figs. 114 and 115). The foot is bandaged, and the figure-of-eight turna Fig. —The Box-splint, showing arrangement of Anterior and Lateral Pads. around the ankle ensure that the foot is at right angles. Finally, when necessary, the extension is adjusted. With the box-splint one can at once see whether the foot is at right angles or not, and to what extent rotation outwards exists. The tendency of the heel to pass backwards can be largely avoided by the use of a substantial ring-pad. Second Method—In the Flexed Position.—Many surgeons believe that the position of flexion is one in which a "broken leg may be treated "S-—The Box-splint applied. with most advantage. The principle of relaxing the muscles to pre- vent spasm is an old and good one, but the merits of extension are greater. One may, however, easily conceive cases and circum- stances where the flexion method is preferable. By flexing the leg

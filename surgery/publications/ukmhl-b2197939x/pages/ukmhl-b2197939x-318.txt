298 APPENDIX. To Cliromicise Catgut without making it too hard.—(i) Prepare the following solution :—Dissolve 15 grains of bichromate of potash in I oz. of boiled or distilled water; add this to 15 ozs, of absolute alcohol. (2) Steep the catgut (sterilised as above) in this solution for 15 hours. (3) Transfer to storage solution. Storage Solutions for Catgut. (i) Absolute alcohol, Glycerine,. Corrosive sublimate. 90 10 pts. (2) Olive oil containing 20 per cent, of carbolic acid—z.e., 1-5 car- bolic oil. (A^. 5.—Since tt was shown that carbolic oil is slow and unreliable for sterilising catgut, surgeons have been afraid to use it as a storing fluid. There is, however, no real ground for this fear, and the advantages of strong carbolic oil as a storing fluid are many and great.)

Methods of Drawing off Catgut during an Operation.—The requi- sites are ease of obtaining the catgut thread, preservation from con- Fig. 201. lamination of the catgut not used, choice of different thicknesses, and facility in replacing new supplies when a given quantity has run out Many more or less complicated vessels fitted with sets of spools or reels have been introduced, but none have proved quite satisfactory in all of the required particulars, and we have to fall back on a choice of tNvo simpfe methods. One is to have yard or metre lengths of catgut rolled on s^eparate spools, which are removed fi'om the bottles during an opera- tion ind laid on the instrument tray, but not "^ed ^^^J" f°;j^"> operation. This necessitates a considerable waste of catgut. 1 ne orher method is to roll the catgut balls like those of twme. The e pull out from the middle and are used as follows :-Keep two or tnrce

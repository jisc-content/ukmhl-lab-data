A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. 13Â° after acute orchitis or epididymitis. Some lint, and about a dozen stnps of stickmg-plaster, y^-va. wide, and long enough to encircle the testis in both directions, are required. The affected testis is first isolated in the scrotum, by a circle of hnt at its upper part, over which is a layer of plaster. The organ cannot now slip away, and it must be covered with successive layers of plaster, longitudinal and circular. In a few days the swelling by subsiding will have left the plaster loose when it must be applied again.

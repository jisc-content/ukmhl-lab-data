A SURGICAL handbook: 138 Treatment.—Set the fracture. Fix a loop of the plaster (adhesive side out) around the middle third of the humerus by stitching, and carry it backwards around the trunk (Fig. 84). 1 his serves to pull the shoulder backwards, and is said to give a fixed point for the second strip. Interpose lint or wadding between the chest and limb, wherever they are in contact. Lay the second strip of plaster against the sound shoulder, and carry it obliquely across the back to the elbow, where a slit should be made to receive the olecranon, and then ascend over the forearm to the starting-point so as to support and draw forward the elbow (Fig. 85). The injured shoulder is thus left free and exposed. It may be inspected at any moment without disturbing the dressing.

Another method similar to that of Sayre, in which a bandage is employed, is seen in Figs. 86 and 87. \c.) Use of Padded Axillary Handkerchiefs.—In fractures beyond the coraco-clavicular ligament and in others which are not attended with marked forward displacement, or where the patient is rather m- tractable, the shoulder may be braced back by means of two padded axillary handkerchiefs (Fig. 88). The presence of knots bclund may be obviated by interlacing the ends and tying m front (Fig. 89).

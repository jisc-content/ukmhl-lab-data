(5) Spica of the Shoulder is practically the continuation upwards ot the bandage of the upper extremity. The larger loop of the t5gure-of-eight is formed by passing from the highest limit of the upper arm over the shoulder and behind the chest, under the opposite axilla, and back again over the shoulder. As the smaller loop is formed by carrying a turn round the arm, the crossing takes place in the line of the last reversal. In this manner, by continued overlapping turns, the whole shoulder may be covered in. We do not carry the bandage around the neck, since it is so freely moveable; but we select the chest instead, much in the same way as we take the fixed pelvis when applying the spica of the groin, in preference to the mobile abdomen. Just as the rise and fall of the abdominal panetes would vary the tension of the bandage, so also would the movements of the neck relax or tighten the figures-of-eight, and the bandage would not be secure. _ (6) Double Spica of the Groin is of little practical importance, but IS sometimes used to retain dressings. The diagram (Fig. 48) explains itself. There are three crossings produced, one at each grom, and one m the middle line. This bandage might be used in IF!g. 49—Bandage for Left Mamma, begun, F'iK- 50—Double Spica for Left Mamma cases where there was an inguinal hernia on one side, a femoral on the other. For double hemiae of the same kind, it is better to apply a separate single roller to each. (7) Single Spica of the Mamma (Left).—Lay the tail against the

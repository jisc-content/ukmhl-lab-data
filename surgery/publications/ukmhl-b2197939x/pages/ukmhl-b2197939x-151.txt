The future usefulness of a fractured limb depends largely on the diagnosis and on the consequent treatment. More- over, the cases vary so greatly in difficulty, and so much hangs on the result of the first examination, that it is well to study each, no matter how simple, with method and exactness. Diagnosis.—Importance of knowing the History of the Injury.— When a person sustains a fracture, some provisional treatment is usually required and obtained from the by-standers (see Chap, xviii). The surgeon should note carefully the history of the accident. He must ascertain when and how it happened, and should direct special attention to the position of the patient at the time of the injury. It is of importance to know if the limb was used or moved there- after, and to what extent. People have been known to walk even a considerable distance with one of the bones of the leg broken. We wu:h to know the nature and amount of force which brought about the fracture, whether the violence was direct or indirect, so that we may be able to form an opinion as to the position and line of the fracture, and of the character of the displacement.

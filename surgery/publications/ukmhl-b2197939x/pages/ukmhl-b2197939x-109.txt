B. Cases of Poisoning. Cases of poisoning are always anxious ; acute ones are urgent. As treatment depends on diagnosis, no time is to be lost in forming it. Often the statement by the patient or his friends is sufficient. When this is not to be had, the diagnosis must be made on other grounds. Poisons most frequently selected in Suicidal Cases.—Apart (rom the symptoms observable, it is of interest and importance to know what poisons are most frequently selected by suicides, or taken by misadventure. Morselli (On suicide—International Scientific Series, 1881), says—" In the aggregate of suicides which happened in England and Wales in 1863-74, the following poisons seem to have been always more used than any others ; prussic acid, cyanide of potassium, laudanum, oxalic acid, arsenic, strychnine, the vermin-killer, and oil of bitter almonds; whilst in the second and third places are always found caustic acids, mercury, preparations of opium and morphia, vegetable narcotics, phosphorus, and salts of copper; lastly, though rarely chosen, come chloral, chloroform, parafiBn, belladonna, ammonia, cantharides, salts of lead, zinc, and potassium. It is remarkable that caustic alkalies are not found on the list. To compare with this statement of the use of poisons in England, the following Table has been drawn up from the Registrar-General's Report for Scotland for the five years preceding 1889, showing the number of deaths by poisoning, both suicidal and accidental. It will be seen that opium (generally as laudanum) heads the list, and that prussic acid is much less used than it is in England.

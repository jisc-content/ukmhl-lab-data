253 THE URINE. where fixed alkali produces the alkalinity. To the naked eye it forms a lieht flocculent deposit, paler than the supernatant urine, and often forming a film on the surface. It is increased by heat and dissolved in acids. In rare cases this substance is deposited in a crystalline form-stellar phosphate-and then, when in any quantity is'considered as usually associated with grave disorder in any part ol the body [Roberts). n Organic Deposita.—(i) Epithelial Scales and Mucus (taken tot^ether because the latter without the former would generally not be"visible). The light flocculent deposit found in healthy urine consists of epithelial scales shed probably from all parts of the urinary tract, and held together by the mucus ; in women, flattened scales Fig. 186.—Deposit in amraoniacal urine (alkaline fermentation), a. Acid ammonium urate ; b. Ammonio-magnesium phosphate ; c. Bacterium (from Landois and Stirling's Physiology). from the vagina will probably be added. In men, especially after gonorrhoea, the epithelial deposit from the urethra and prostate often appears as whitish flakes and shreds, which, although indicative ot no serious derangement, may occasion much groundless alarm. The epithelium from the bladder, ureter, and pelvis of the kidney, is so like the irregular cells of cancer thai no deduction can be safely drawn from its presence either for or against malignant disease. Renal epithelium, generally more or less altered, is often seen in the urine when the kidneys are diseased, and accompanies a deposit of tube-casts. (2) Tube-Casts consist of either fibrinous or blood-casts of the

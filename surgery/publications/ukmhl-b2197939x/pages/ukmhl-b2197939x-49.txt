(i) Gun-shot Wounds.—Gun-shot wounds in civil practice are generally caused by accidents with fowling-pieces charged with small- shot, or they result from homicidal or suicidal wounds from pistol or revolver. It need, perhaps, hardly be insisted on, that asepticity of such wounds, as of others, is one of the most important elements in their treatment. When none of the body-cavities have been penetrated, the first indication will be arrest of fiKmorrhage, temporarily with a tourniquet, then permanently. Under antiseptic precautions, portions of clothing, wads of paper, or other foreign .soft matter that may have been carried into the wound should be at once removed, likewise splinters of wood and greatly comminuted fragments of bone ; the Fig. 3.—Closure of Wound with laced adhesive plaster and collodion strapping.

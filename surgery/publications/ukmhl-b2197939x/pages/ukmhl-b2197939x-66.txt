A SURGICAL handbook:: 46 '{a.) Close to the hip-joint, the vessels may be controlled by Compression of the abdominal aorta at its bi-furcation, either by an abdominal tourniquet, with its pad below and to the left of the Fig. 9.—Lister's Abdominal Fig. 10.—Pad and Elastic band Tourniquet. compressing the Aorta. umbilicus, directed backwards, and a little inwards (Fig. 9), or by a large pad on the same spot, held in position by several turns of an elastic bandage or tube (Fig. 10), or by Professor MacEwen's method. This is done by an assistant, who takes up the posi- tion in a line with the patient's umbilicus, which is indicated in the figure (Fig. 11). The knuckles of his right hand are placed on the abdo- men, a little to the left of the middle line, the lowest knuckle —i.e., that of the index finger— being at the upper border of the umbilicus. He then leans in this way upon the lower part of the abdominal aorta, and with his left fore-finger on the femoral artery, first on one side, then on the other, gauges the pressure necessary to control the circulation. Pressure can be easily maintained for half an hour or longer without fatigue. In none of these methods •need the temporary compres- sion of the intestines be feared. The real objection is rather the hindrance to respiration, which in an enfeebled patient may seriously complicate anaesthesia. Fig. II.—Professor MacEwen's Method (after MacEwen).

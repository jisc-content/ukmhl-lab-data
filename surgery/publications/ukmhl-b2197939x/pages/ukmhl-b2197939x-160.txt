The rarer fractures which are met wfth at the neck are only diagnosed by excluding the possibility of other injuries. Where the hne of the fracture passes at the omo-hyoid notch, marked tenderness, with perhaps crepitus and abnormal mobility, is felt on manipulating the coracoid pro- cess. Where the glenoid alone is detached, a dislocation is sim- ulated ; but the contour of the shoulder is restored by merely supporting the elbow, and lost again on withdrawal of support- conditions which we do not ob- tain in dislocation. Treatment is similar to that of fracture of the clavicle; a light axillary pad, sling to support the elbow, and retention-bandage, 3 2 1 Fig. go. — Gooch-Splints shaped for Fracture of the Humerus—Nos. i and 2 are cut to avoid pressure on the internal condyle, 3 is used to command the rest of the arm as in Fig. 91.

Displacement is due to the direction of the force, character of the fractured surfaces, and the relation of the break to the deltoid and muscles attached to the region of the bicipital

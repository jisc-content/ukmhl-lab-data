ON FRACTURES. 147 (7) Fractures of the Metacarpals are associated with displace- ment due to a drooping of the head of the bone. By placing a small pad of wool in the pahn of the hand, to prevent the finger- nails from irritating, and bandaging the closed fist over this, fixation is ensured, and union results in three weeks, ^^^len the first or fifth meta- carpal has given way, it is, perhaps, better to secure the extended ^'S- lo;^.—Anterior Gooch-splint used by s CoUes Fracture. It is cut away in front ■ some ia - .0 a.way in front of the lower fragment of the radius, and only reaches the middle of the palm. hand and fore-arm to an anterior padded Gooch-splint This method may also be used in all cases. Fractures of the Fhalaftges are treated by binding the injured fanger and its fellows, in the extended position, to a splint, wh ch ia prolonged up the forearm. Bennett's fracture of the base of the metacarpal of the thumb is by no means rare, according to Miles and Struthers, bein? com- monly taken for a sprain. It is caused by a force acting along the aas of the metacarpal, whereby the palmar projection of thi base of the metacarpals chipped off, and the bone is shortened as t passes on to the back of the trapezium. Reduction is effected by Thnr^h S '• / poroplastic splint applied over the thumb and wnst. Passive motion and massage may be employed after two or three weeks. cmpiuycu

ARREST OF HEMORRHAGE. 67 fluid to enter. N.B.—After the injection is finished, the nozzle is withdrawn and the proximal ligature tightened. If a repetition of the injection is anticipated, the ends of this ligature should be left long for use again. Otherwise, the ends are to be cut short. The wound is dressed with a small pad of sterilised gauze and a bandage. {b.) In Blood TraHsfuston.—This may be either mediate or immediate. The latter involves special apparatus, and does not present any advantage commensurate with the trouble it entails. Clotting of blood in the apparatus or in the recipient's veins is most to be feared. The mediate method may be carried out either (i) by whipping the freshly-drawn blood with fine twigs, so as to remove the fibrin; or (2) by adding a 5 per cent, solution of phosphate of soda (i oz. to the pint of distilled water), in the proportion of one of Fig. 29. - Transfusion of Blood, solution to three of blood, and injecting the mixture. The phosphate of soda prevents coagulation. This, known as Hicks' method, was introduced by J. M. Cotterill into Edinburgh, where it has been largely and often successfully used in cases of pernicious anjemia. While a nozzle is being tied into the vein of the recipient as above, the arm of the giver is prepared for venesection. A bandage is applied to the upper arm to restrict the venous return. The skin over the median basilic is cleansed and purified, and an oblique inci-sion is made through it into the vein. The blood which flows is caught and rapidly stirred in a vessel containing the warm phosphate of soda solution, of which the quantity required has been fixed beforehand. To prevent the mixture from cooling, the vessel con- taining it should be kept floating in a basin of hot water. A glass syringe holding 8 to lo ounces should be made ready by purifying

The third part of the subclavian may be com- pressed against the first rib by a firm pad pressed downwards from above the clavicle by an assistant (Fig. 15). For this purpose, an india-rubber tipped compressor has been devised, but the handle of a door-key or other similar instrument, well padded, acts nearly as well. Keen recommends the following plan :—" A suitable roller bandage, 2 inches wide, is placed above the clavicle over the position of the artery as ascertained by the touch." Esmarch's elastic bandage, well-stretched, is then wound over it. In order to keep the pad Fig. 13.—Elastic Tourniquet applied for Amputation at the Hip-joint.

One or two turns under the opposite axilla are used to prevent the pad from slipping outwards and downwards. Thus no assistant is required o keep the pad in place, but the elastic compression would tend to nterfere with respiration. When the greatest security is desired, Mr Syme's plan should be followed.

Two strong steel spear-pointed pins are used ; each is \ inch thick and about lo inches long. One transfixes skin and pectoralis major muscle at a point about 3 inches on the inner side of the shoulder— i.e., just within the coracoid process. The other transfixes skin, deep fascia, and muscle on the dorsal aspect of the scapula, about the same level. Each pin is hidden in the tissues for about 3 inches, and their points are protected with pieces of cork or metal tubing (Fig. 16). After the limb has been rendered bloodless by Esmarch's band, a piece of india-rubber tubing, about i inch in diameter, and long enough to go five or six times round the shoulder, is wound tightly round above the pins. This will remain in position after dis- articulation of the shoulder is complete. Sometimes the axillary artery can most readily be controlled by elastic tubing (Figs. 17, 18), which is removed after the main vessels have been ligatured.

In the neck, the common carotid may be temporarily compressed agamst the cervical vertebrae, by inserting the fingers beneath the stemo-mastoid and pressing directly backwards. The "carotid" tubercle—z.e., the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra—is the best position to take ; but the operation is always a painful one Owing to the freedom of anastomosis across the middle line, not much 13 to be expected from compression of the vessels of the face or scalp. ihe facml arUriis m3.y held against the lower jaw just in front of the masseter ; the temporal arteries, against the sides 4 Fig. 16.—Wyeth's method of using pins in amputation at shoulder (after Wyeth).

Fortunately, how- Zl: f "^'^^^"IS after tons.lotomy is generally slight, and ceases spon- aneously m a few minutes. It is worthy of note that in at least three recorded cases, previously serious bleeding ceased after a f5t ot vomiting, whether spontaneously or artificially induced (10) Bleeding frovi the Palmar Arch has been already alluded to 1 he reason for the difficulty is, that in the palm, the superficial arch IS covered by strong fascia, and lies near large nerves. Free dissec- Uon IS also prevented by the after-inconvenience of large cicatrices 1 he deep arch is out of reach. If a limited dissection give small hope of success, apply firm pressure—possibly graduated-with anti- sejnic precautions. At the same time restrain the circulation in the hands by the methods already indicated (p. 54). Should these measures fail, ligature of the brachial artery would be the ne.xt step. Hemophilia.—The above indications have been made on the assumption that the patient's tendency to spontaneous healing of vessels has been normal. There exists, however, a condition, fortunately rare, where patients bleed long and freely on the slightest provocation. The disease is known as " Hremophilia." and the patients as " Hasmophilics" or "bleeders." The nature of the malady is obscure. The vessels seem normal, but the cause ot the bleeding tendency seems to be an imperfect power of coagulation. Wright strongly advises the internal administration of chloride of calcium in hremophilia (see p. 58). Swabbing the bleeding part with adrenalin solution (i-iooo) should also be tried. Haemophilia is often hereditary, and is probably often present in degrees. In bad cases, a slight pinch of the skin will be followed by extensive ecchymosis, and smaller cuts by continuous oozing. In dealing with such patients, reliance must chiefly be placed upon pressure and styptics.

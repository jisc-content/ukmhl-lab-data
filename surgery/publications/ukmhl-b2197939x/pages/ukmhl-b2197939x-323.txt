APPENDIX. 303 K SICK-ROOM COOKERT RECEIPTS. By Miss A. M. Griggs. Since the proper cooking and serving-up of food are so important in- the nutrition of patients, we mal<e no apology for adding a series of well-tried sick-room cookery receipts to oiir Surgical Handbook. For these we are entirely indebted to Miss A. M. Griggs, who has tested their value, and makes frequent use of them in her classes. Soups and Beef Tea. Chicken Soup. Required—A young chicken (the remains of the chicken, of which the breast was used in the chicken panada, p. 305, may be utiliied). 2 pints fresh cold water. Yolks of 2 eggs. % teaspoonful salt. i gill of cream. 12 peppercorns. Slice of dry toast. I blade of mace. Small "bouquet garni" {i.e., a sprig of thyme, parsley, and bayleaf). Cut the chicken into small joints, remove the skin, and put the joints into a basin with sufBcient boihng water to cover them, and allow to stand for 10 minutes to remove all fat. Pour away the water, and wash the chicken joints in cold water, then put them into a china-lined saucepan, with 2 pints of cold water, the salt, peppercorns, mace, and the bouquet garni. Let the mixture boil, skim thoroughly, and then simmer for about 3 hours till the meat is parting from the bones; strain and set aside to get cold. Take the meat from the bones, pound it in a mortar and pass through a hair-sieve, then mix with the yolks and the cream. Carefully remove every particle of fat from the liqmd strained from the bones, and pour the liquid gradually over the pounded chicken mixture. Stir over the fire until quite hot, but do not allow to boil or it will curdle and the soup be spoiled. Serve with toast cut into neat pieces. Mutton Broth (Inexpensive).

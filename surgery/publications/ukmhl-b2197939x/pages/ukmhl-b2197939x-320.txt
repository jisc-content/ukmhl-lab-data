Fig. 204. APPENDIX. 300 Gauze Dressings in Balls.â€”The same method may with advantage be used for gauze dressings. Fold a length of gauze across its breadth till it is an eighth of its original breadth. Wind it on a glass rod about of an inch in diameter. .'Vs the muslin passes through the hand it forms itself into a loose cord. Finish the ball by tucking the end under the last turn. The ball may then be sterilised. Prepared gauze, such as bicyanide or iodoform gauze, is usually sent out by the manufacturer in rolls folded to one-eighth of the breadth of the " piece." It is thus ready to be made into a ball. When finished, the ball should be fitted into a surgically clean jar or box, and the inner end brought up through a plug of cotton wool (Fig. 204). When required for dressings, portions can be drawn up and cut off as required without disturbing the remainder. Iodoform gauze should have a stoppered jar. Messrs. J- F. M'Farlan & Co. will send out any of their prepared gauze dressings in ball form if requested to do so, and can supply suitable celluloid boxes to hold them.

51 ARUEST 01' HEMORRHAGE. During the progress of an operation, the mouths of bleeding vesselscan be secured by these pressure forceps as they are divided, or just before it, if the vessels can be seen, and the surgeon may proceed with his work, leav- ing, perhaps, ten or twelve pairs of for- ceps hanging on to the surface of the wound. In a few minutes he may re- turn to the forceps, and find, after tying the larger vessels, that the squeezing of the smaller ones has completely closed them. Tying of Arteries. In tying the arter- ies, the forceps should be drawn by an assis- tant, obliquely away from the person who ties, as soon as the ligature has been passed round the ar- tery (Fig. 22). As the first knot is being tightened, the handle of the forceps should be lowered more and more on the side away from the knot, to lessen the risk of including their points. On the knot side, the operator's forefingers ensure that the thread passes well over the forceps. When the thread, thus guided on to the Fi. «.-T.i„, K„f Kno.. .e.Hod.

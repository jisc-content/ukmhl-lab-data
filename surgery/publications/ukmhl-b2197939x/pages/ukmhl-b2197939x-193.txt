EXTEMPORARY AFFLlAJM^Ji^. lyj The great secret in handling a fractured limb is to keep up extension upon it, until the splints be applied. (a.) ExUmporary Splints, it is needless to say, may be of any material that fvill give the necessary stiffness. For shorter sphnts a n.ass of folded paper of any kind does very well, or a folded coat^ ^cSng, or other stout cloth. Nothing is better than the straw «velo|es used for packing bottles. Pieces of fire-wood, old wooden or pasteboard boxes broken up, walking-sticks, and umbrellas, are also generally available. . , A capital spUnt may be made by knotting together pieces of wood, w'dsps of hay or straw, or bundles of twigs. This used m Vhe army, and makes a splint which closely imitates Gooch s, adapting itself easily to the limb (Fig. 127).

Three bands are generally enough-one at the ankle, another at the knee, and the third round the thigh.. In addition, a board may be fastened below the legs, to make aU secure (Fig. 128).

How to lift and carry the /'a/zVw/'.—Supposing a fracture to have occurred on the street, and the injured limb to have been secured with temporary splints—the next matter is to lift the patient, and carry him to his house or the nearest hospital. A patient thus injured may be carried (i) in the arms; (2) on a blanket; (3) on an extemporised stretcher.

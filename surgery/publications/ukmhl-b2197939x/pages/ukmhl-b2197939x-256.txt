A SURGICAL HANDBOOK. 236 glass alone or mixed with whiting should be smeared on with a brush or sponge, then another layer of bandage, and so on for three or four layers. (Esmarch advises the use of a freshly-made con- centrated solution of neutral silicate of potash.) By moistening the water-glass, it may be softened previous to cutting it for removal. (z.) Gum and Chalk.—A mixture of mucilage and powdered chalk of the consistence of paste may be used instead of starch or water-glass; but it has no advantage over these, and is dearer. (k.) Paraffin Bandage.—Paraffin may be applied with a brush in the melted state in the same way as starch. Although not so rigid as water-glass, it has the advantage of being waterproof; and though more expensive than most of the above, it may be boiled out of old bandages, and used over again. (/.) Finisliing the Surface of Fixed Bandages.—Plaster of Paris may be glazed with switched white of egg or with size. Its surface may be rendered waterproof by a layer of paraffin, or by several layers of boiled linseed oil, damar, or shellac varnish. In a similar way, a waterproof coat may be applied to any of the other fixed bandages, and is especially needed for children. In the neighbourhood of a window cut for dressing a wound, Esmarch advises a packing of wool saturated with collodion to prevent the soaking in of discharge. In the absence of collodion, some of the other waterproof materials above mentioned might be substituted.

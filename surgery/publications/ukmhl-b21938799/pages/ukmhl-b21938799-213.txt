CHAPTER XIII. GUNSHOT WOUNDS, WITH DIRECT PENETRATION OR PERFORA- TION OF THE LARGER JOINTS, WITH FRACTURE OF BONE. The following remarks are restricted to those cases where there is undoubted evidence of the joint having been pene- trated. For instance, cases of partial or even complete fracture of bone close to a joint should be returned as a fracture of a long bone, and not as penetrating a joint. These cases, although generally very severe, and followed by acute inflam- mation and suppuration, ending in anchylosis (as in the case of Farraher, page 171), are not of such a dangerous nature as when the ball has passed directly through the joint, fracturing the bones, as in those included under the present head. No description of wounds are more dangerous, and so fre- quently prove fatal, as gunshot wounds of joints; the result of these cases depends, in a great measure, on the size of the articulation, and the nature of the wound, the appliances that are at hand for treatment, the means of transport and provi- sions. The superiority of the two latter has been well illus- trated in the success obtained amongst the wounded during the late mutiny in India, compared to what occurred during the war in the Crimea. Wounds of ginglymoid joint are more severe than those of tho ball and socket, partly from being of a more complex nature. Fissures extending into joints, although not always attended with serious consequences, still they are generally to be looked upon as a very severe injury. Much attention is also necessary in cases of gunshot wounds in the vicinity of the joint, on account of the inflammation that is so liable to be set up in them, and from the stiffness and contraction of the structures around from

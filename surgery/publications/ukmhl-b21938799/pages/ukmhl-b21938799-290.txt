NUMBER WOUNDED, AND TIIE 238 On comparing the frequency among the eases from India of Gunshot wounds of the superior extremity, 159, or 20’36 per cent, of the total that arrived. Amputation of the superior ex- tremity, 127, or 21-22 per cent. Total, 286, or 47-42 per cent. Gunshot wounds of inferior extremity, 162, or 27*03 per cent. Amputation of the inferior extremity, 34, or 5-80 per cent. Total, 196, or 30-84 per cent. From this it is seen that there is only an excess of 3 in the wounds of the lower than that of the upper extremity; but the proportion of successful amputations is very much in favour of the superior extremity, there being 83 more than in the lower extremity. The number of amputations of the arm are 46, and of the thigh 11. This difference is to be attributed to the greater mortality in amputation of the thigh over that in the arm. The amputations of the forearm and leg are very nearly the same, being 19 of the former and 18 of the latter. There arc 53 amputations of the fingers and thumbs, while there are only 2 of the toes; still, these minor operations raise the pro- portion of the total number of successful amputations of the superior over the inferior extremity. In the Crimean war there were— Gunshot wounds of the superior extremity, 2083 treated, or 30-2 per cent, of the entire wroundcd; 47 died, or 2'9 per cent, of those treated. Gunshot wounds of the lower extremity, 2198 treated, or 31*76 per cent, of the entire wounded; 166 died, or 8-3 per cent, of those treated. Had the result of the operations performed been added, the difference would have been increased in a very material degree. The number of cases that occurred under the remainder of the classes is very small, as the following extract from the return of the India cases will show : Gunshot w'ounds of the face, 22, or 364 per cent, of the entire wounded. Ditto, neck, 7, or 1-15 per cent. Ditto, back and spine, 9, or 1*49 per cent. Ditto, perineum, genital and urinary organs, 3, or 049 per cent. Ditto, with direct penetration of the larger joints, 8, or 1 -32 per cent.

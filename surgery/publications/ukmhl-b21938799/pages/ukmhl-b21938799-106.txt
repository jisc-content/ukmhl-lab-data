CHAPTER IV. GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE NECK. Wounds of the neck inflicted by a sword or any sharp-cutting instrument are very rapidly fatal, from division of some of the great vessels. The first point to be attended to is to arrest the bleeding from both arteries and veins by the application of ligatures and pressure, bringing the lips of the wound properly together. It is remarkable that the large arteries and veins in the neck should escape injury so frequently in gunshot wounds. This may, in some measure, be accounted for by the structures in this region being so loose and movable that they yield or recede before any projectile. Eight cases were admitted, and eight were discharged to duty. In one the ball entered close to the thyroid cartilage on the left side, and still remains in, but its position could not be ascertained with certainty. One was a flesh wound on the right of the larynx; ball dropped out. In another case the ball entered external to the right sterno-mastoid, and passed out at the margin of the trapezius, without injuring an important vessel or nerve. 78th Regiment.— Private Benjamin Ritchie, wounded at Lucknow, September 25tli, 1857, by a musket ball, in the left side of the neck, close to the thyroid cartilage; the ball still remains in, but its position cannot be ascertained with certainty. He spat up blood for some time after. June lltli, 1858.—He cannot move his head except to a small extent laterally, and keeps his head bent down upon the chest. In consequence of this constrained position, the spinous processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae project. 17th.—At Fort Pitt, under the sup- position that the ball might possibly be lying imbedded in this

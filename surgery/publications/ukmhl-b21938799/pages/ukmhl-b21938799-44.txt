GUNSHOT INJURIES PRODUCING 12 Compression. Pressure applied to the brain produces derangement of its functions and a condition called compression, which may arise from a number of causes—from a foreign body lodged in the cranium; from the pressure of a portion of bone; of blood ex- travasatcd; or pus formed within the cranium. The most prominent symptoms are coma and stupor, or the patient is drowsy or insensible, not answering questions when spoken to, or only when shaken and spoken to in a loud voice; perhaps paralysis, more or less complete; breathing slow, labouring, and stertorous, with a peculiar blowing by the mouth during expiration; pupils dilated and insensible to light; pulse distinct and full, often slow' and sometimes intermittent; the faeces are passed involuntarily, while the urine is retained; the skin is of its usual temperature, and occasionally even warmer and per- spiring; sensation is completely lost; pricking or pinching produces no signs of feeling pain; the sight, smelling, and hearing are also lost; the voluntary muscles are powerless and relaxed, and the limbs are incapable of motion. Sometimes this state of coma is succeeded by paroxysms of delirium or convulsions. These symptoms either come on immediately or secondarily, according to the cause; they are immediate when produced by a depressed portion of bone, foreign body, or sudden haemor- rhage; secondary when they arise from slow bleeding or suppu- ration. In many instances concussion merges into compression, so that the symptoms of each are not distinct, and they are also often modified by the inflammatory process. The brain seems to have the power of accommodating itself to the effects of pressure to a certain extent, although the cause which produced it should still remain—as is seen in cases of depressed' fracture, when, without any elevation of the depressed portion of bone, the symptoms, which w'ere at first those of compression, after a fewr days entirely disappear and the patient recovers. It is seldom that pure examples, either of concussion or compression, arc met with in actual practice. The injury which causes a concussion will, most likely, also produce rup-

WITH CONTUSION AND PARTIAL FRACTURE. 135 and outer part of the upper third of the left thigh from behind forwards. Wounded by a second musket hall in the anterior aspect of the left thigh, the ball entering about three inches below Poupart’s ligament, close to the course of the femoral artery, where it lodged. Amputation of the fore and middle fingers, between the first and second phalanges, was performed four days after. August 16th.—Covering of stumps of fingers good; motions of ring and little fingers impaired; perforating wound of thigh healed. The wound where the ball is lodged still remains open ; there is only a small sinus, through which the ball can be felt, situated close to the inner side of the femoral vein; attempts were made to dilate the wound by tents, as it would have been rather hazardous to cut down upon it, being so very near the femoral artery and vein; the man objected strongly to have an incision made for its removal, and, as the wound had closed, he was discharged the service, October 15th, 1858, on account of loss of fingers by amputation, under which head he is included in the return, although noticed in this place for the wound in the thigh. With Contusion and partial Fracture of Long Bones, AND OF THE BONES OF THE PELVIS, IN THEIR RELATION TO the Lower Extremities. 50 were admitted, of whom 29 were sent to duty, 6 to modified duty, and 15 invalided. 5 were partial fractures of the ilium, 3 in the thigh, 14 in the tibia, and 5 in the fibula; 13 were caused by ball, 3 by grape, 1 by round shot, and l by shell. Of the 5 cases of fracture of the ilium, several were very severe; in 2 the balls were supposed still to remain impacted in the ilium, but catising no inconvenience; in 1 a portion of bone, two inches in diameter, came away by necrosis; of the 3 cases of wounds in the thigh, in 2 of them there was only slight injury to the femur; in the third case the ball entered in the popliteal space, and anchylosis of the knee-joint resulted; of the 14 wounded in the leg, there was 1 where the ball fractured the tibia, with, probably, a split into the ankle-joint; in 1 case sloughing followed, requiring ligature of the posterior tibial artery; in 1 a round shot tore the soft parts

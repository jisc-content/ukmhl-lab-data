Table 2.—Proportion of cases of Gunshot Compound Fiactuie of the Femur to Thigh Stump cases, and to all cases of Wounds and Injuries in action, passed through the In- valid Depot at Chatham; also the proportion of Thigh Stump cases to total of all classes of wounded.

In other words, the proportion of thigh stump cases being so nearly the same, the gunshot fracture of the femur cases from India over and above the proportion from the Crimea, may be received as repre- senting the proportion of the cases of this description of wound lost there by amputation, or by less favorable circumstances of service. The difference, I believe, is to be explained by the better appliances and means attending field hospitals in India, and to the less frequent practice there of amputation in this description of wound. The difference is not to be explained

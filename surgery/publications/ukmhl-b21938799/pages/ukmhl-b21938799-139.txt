CHAPTER VIII. GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. Simple Flesh Contusions and Wounds. When the abdominal walls are divided to any extent by a musket ball or by a sharp-cutting instrument, ventral hernia is very liable to take place. Occasionally a ball striking obliquely against the parietes, runs for a considerable distance under the skin, or partly between the peritoneum and muscles, in which case the course of the ball will be usually marked by a line on the skin of a reddish-blue colour, and the constitutional alarm will not be to any great extent and will soon subside. Abscesses are apt to form in the abdominal walls after severe injuries from stabs, or from gunshot, &c., and require to be opened early. Severe contusions from falls or blows may produce rupture of the intestines or of the solid abdominal viscera, and death take place within a short time. When there is rupture of any of the hollow viscera, there is extravasation of gas and of the contents of the intestines to a greater or less extent, causing rapid swelling and tension of the belly, which is a tolerably certain symptom of rupture of the gut. The solid viscera are sometimes ruptured by falls or contu- sions from cannon shot, without causing much injury to the skin of the abdomen, and the patient generally dies from haemorrhage. Wounds of the walls of the abdomen without penetration of the peritoneum and without internal injury, are to be treated on ordinary principles. In incised wounds the stitches should be inserted through the skin only, and the parietes should be relaxed by careful attention to position. When the symp-

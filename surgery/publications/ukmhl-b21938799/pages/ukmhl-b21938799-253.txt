Provision must, therefore, be made so that at first the parts behind should be longer than those in the anterior flap, otherwise there will be very little covering, and the stump will never look well. The objections to this operation, and also to that by lateral flaps and circidar operation, is, that there is frequently a great prominence in front, in consequence of the retraction of the muscles, and also from the cicatrix in the skin being in the centre, where the patient will afterwards rest the limb in the wooden leg; to avoid this, some surgeons prefer a large single flap from behind, so that the cicatrix may be in front. Still, if anterior and posterior flaps are properly performed, this method is generally to be preferred to any other. Lateral Flaps.—This operation is most appropriate at the lower third of the thigh, on account of the end of the bone not being so liable to be drawn up, and to protrude through the angle of the flap, as it is when performed in the middle or upper thirds, in consequence partly of the action of the psoas and iliacus internus muscles, and the weight and contraction of the muscles behind. It is, therefore, the usual practice to ampu- tate by the anterior and posterior method in all parts of the thigh; or to perform the lateral operation at the lower third, and anterior and posterior at the middle and upper thirds. The operation is performed in this manner :—The surgeon, standing on the outside of the limb, should grasp the soft parts on the outside of the thigh between his fingers and thumb, and having drawn them from the side of the bone, should pass the knife from above downwards, and then cut downwards and out-

CHAPTER XIX. EXCISIONS. Superior Extremity. Three cases of resection of joints have arrived from India, viz., one of the shoulder, and two of the elbow-joint. Out of a total number of 36 primary resections that occurred in the Crimean war—of which 28 were performed on the superior, and 8 on the lower extremity—of the former 6 died and of the latter 4 died, viz., 4 cases of excision of the head of the femur. Excisions are seldom required in either clavicle or scapula ; portions of caries or necrosed bones can be removed by gauge or forceps. Shoulder-joint.* "When the soft parts are not extensively lacerated by gunshot, this operation can be practised with the best results. When the head of the bone is shattered, the operation can be performed in the following manner :—The patient being seated, or laid on a table with his shoulders raised, a semilunar incision is made with a strong bistoury, commencing opposite the coracoid process, and ending about an inch behind and below the root of the acromion, and thus forming a flap of nearly the whole of the deltoid. It is dis- sected upwards, and then a firm incision is made through the tendons attached to the tuberosity on the humerus and capsule, # I beg to refer to “ Gunshot wounds with direct penetration and perforation of the larger joints,” for further information on this subject.

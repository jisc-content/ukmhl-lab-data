90 GUNSHOT WOUNDS OE THE CHEST. spine, wounding tlie lung; both wounds are soundly healed. The ball at entrance seems to have gone between the ribs, but at exit a hole in the scapula can still be felt. Had been previously wounded in the Crimea by a musket ball in left shoulder, which seems to produce a partial fracture of left scapula. The right lung now (two years after the injury) works well, but that side of the chest is scarcely so much expanded as the opposite; there is no dulness on percussion, lie was not bled locally or generally. Invalided.

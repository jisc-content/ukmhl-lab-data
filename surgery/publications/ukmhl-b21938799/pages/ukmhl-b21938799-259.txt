LOWER EXTREMITIES. 209 tlie middle of tlie leg, with the object of continuing the move- ments of the knee-joint, or the patient could rest on the knee bent, and the projection behind would not look unseemly, and the stump would also be long enough to allow of an artificial leg so as to use the joint, and this is the operation which should generally be performed in military practice "when the foot or ankle-joint has been fractured or injured. When in amputation at the lower third, patients can be provided with a good, well- made wooden leg, so that the patient can walk many miles a day without much inconvenience; this apparatus is, however, some- what more expensive than when the patient has to rest upon the bent knee. On the other hand, when an amputation has been performed in the middle of the leg (which is the site generally recommended), the stump is made of such a length as to fix into the socket of an artificial leg and foot. Should it be found that the weight of the body cannot be sustained in this way, he can have an apparatus so that he can rest on the bent knee, and the projection behind would be such that little notice would be taken of it. When the surgeon has the option, he should pre- fer operating about the middle of the leg, where he is certain to find plenty of soft parts to form a covering for the bones, whereas, if the operation is performed near the ankle, there is a chance of a deficiency of covering. Flap operation in the middle of the Leg.—This may be per- formed in the following manner :—The patient should be placed on a firm table, and held by assistants, one of whom should have charge of the flap. The femoral artery should be compressed on the brim of the pelvis, by placing two thumbs upon it, and grasping the thigh at the same time; or a tourniquet can be applied with a common hard calico roller placed parallel with the course of the artery, when the requisite amount of pressui’e can be made by turning the screw. One method is, the surgeon passes an amputating knife from one side of the limb to the other, close behind the bones, and forms a flap from the calf of the leg, about three or four inches in length, according to the size and shape of the parts. The knife should then be drawn across the front of the limb w ith a semi- lunar sweep between the points he has already transfixed ; the flaps should then be drawn up, and the bones cleared of the soft 14

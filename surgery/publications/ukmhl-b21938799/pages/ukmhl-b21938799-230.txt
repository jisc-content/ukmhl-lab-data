CHAPTER XVI. SWORD, LANCE, AND BAYONET WOUNDS. Sword and Lance Wounds. Under tliis head 47 were admitted, of which 14 were sent to duty, 9 to modified duty, and 24 invalided. In 2 cases the elbow-joint was wounded; in 5 the forearm ; in 2 the back of the wrist : and in 3 cases the fingers and thumbs were injured. In those invalided the condition of the forearm and fingers was more or less injured. In one of them both bones of the forearm were severed, with nearly total loss of use of the hand resulting. In another the tendons of the ring-finger of the right hand were cut, and the joint became ancliylosed; and in the third there was impaired use of the thumb and the index-finger from the extensor tendons having been cut. In one of the cases sent to modified duty the elbow-joint had been opened into, followed by anchylosis. There is also a second case of anchylosis of the elbow-joint that has been invalided. 90th Regiment.—Private Joseph Albison, wounded by sabre cut on the posterior part of the right forearm, about three inches above the wrist, which nearly severed both bones. There is now loss of power of the extensor muscles ; there is considerable deposition of new osseous matter around the cut bone. The hand is slightly bent inwards, powerless, and he cannot use his fingers, which arc in a straight position. June 15th, 1858.— Invalided. 9th Lancers.—Private Joseph Twining, wounded at Delhi by a sabre cut on the posterior and under surface of the left elbow- joint, which appears to have cut the external condyle of the humerus and olecranon. No pieces of bone came away, and

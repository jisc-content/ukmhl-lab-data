GUNSHOT INJURIES PRODUCING 28 temporal bone was easily removed, allowing a great quantity of fluid blood to escape. The centre artery of the dura mater being wounded, the man expired a few minutes afterwards. Fracture of the External Taele only. This table may be fractured above, and forced inwards upon the diploe, inflammation and suppuration may take place,, and perhaps necrosis. Fracture, with depression of the external table only, without any corresponding injury to the internal table, is most likely to occur at the superciliary ridges of the frontal bones, or in the neighbourhood of the mastoid pro- cesses, in consequence of the frontal sinuses and mastoid cells causing greater separation between the two tables of the skull than any other part of the cranium. Fracture of the Inner or Vitreous Table of the Skull, Without fracture or depression of the outer, is of very rare occurrence; still such an accident may take place, as the fol- lowing case shows.* This case proved fatal from compression of the cerebral sub- stance. The question arises—would this compression have been relieved by the operation of trephining? I believe not, and for the following reasonsfirst, that the compressing medium was not a fluid which might have escaped through an aperture in the cranium, but coagulated blood; and, secondly, to have operated, and punctured the dura mater when this membrane w as m a state of inflammation wrould have greatly inci cased the chances of a fatal issue. The case is interesting, as showing an injury of the internal table of the skull, uncon- nected with any lesion of the external, and produced by a ball whose conical shape and sharp apex would have led one to expect quite the opposite injury, viz., fracture of the external table, and * See the remarks on this subject in Mr. Guthrie’s ‘ Commentaries/ paragraph 2G2, lecture xviii; and Hennen’s ‘ Military Surgery/ p. 326, last edition, 1S29.

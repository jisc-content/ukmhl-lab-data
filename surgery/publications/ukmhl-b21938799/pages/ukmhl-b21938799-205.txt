COMPOUND FRACTURE OF FEMUR. 157 by difference of missiles, for in tlie Peninsular war, where no other than the sixteen to the pound bullet was used, the im- pressions of surgeons experienced in the surgery of that war was, that in only few exceptions should a gunshot fractured thigh not at once be amputated. This rule greatly influenced the practice of surgery in the Crimean war, and hence, in a considerable measure, I believe, the less favorable results thence than from the mutiny in India, when surgeons wrere not only deterred from amputation of the thigh by the Crimean experi- ence of the fatality attending that operation, but were more inclined to attempt preservation of the limb by the better means at hand for the conveyance and treatment of such compound fractured thigh cases. Further, it is to be observed, that only one fourth of the total thigh stump cases are to be considered as amputations after gunshot compound fracture of the femur; and this being the case, the number thus wounded in the Indian mutiny, who have recovered with the limb on, is eleven, whilst the number recovered after amputation for this description of wound, is only between four and five. The records of thigh stump cases amongst the wounded from the Crimea, passed through the Invalid Depot, Chatham, rarely give the nature of the injury for which the amputation was performed, and the part of the shaft through which the bone was sawed is only recorded in twenty-two of the sixty-two total cases. I subjoin brief extracts of ten* of the cases of gunshot com- pound fracture of the femur, and of the thirteen thigh stump cases referred to in the preceding remarks.‚Äù Mr. Taylor then gives a Tabular Abstract of the ten cases of Gunshot Compound Fracture of the Femur, which have already been detailed in the previous pages. * Tlie eleventh case is that of Sapper Charles BoneSj R.E.

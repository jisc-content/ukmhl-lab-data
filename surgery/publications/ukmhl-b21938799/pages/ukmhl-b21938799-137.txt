CHAPTER VII. GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. Several cases are on record of patients having lived for days and even weeks after wounds of the heart, but all these cases are exceptional, and are only objects of curiosity, and show what amount of injury these important organs can bear without proving immediately fatal. The Museum can only furnish three cases of these formidable wounds. The following preparation, No. 173, exhibits a lance wound which penetrated the right ventricle through the diaphragm. Death five days after the wound. J. Dierking, a stout muscular man, of the 3rd German Hussars, was wounded at the Battle of Waterloo by a lance, which penetrated the chest between the fifth and sixth ribs, and was then withdrawn. He fell from his horse, lost a good deal of blood by the mouth, and some by the wound, and was carried to Brussels without any particular attention being drawn to the injury. His strength not being restored, whilst he suffered from palpitation of the heart, and other uneasy sensations in the chest, he was sent to England to be invalided, and in November, 1815, to the York Hos- pital, Chelsea, in consequence of an attack of pneumonia, of which he died in two days, without attention being par- ticularly drawn to the cicatrix of the wound. On examining the body it was found that the lance, having injured the edge of the cartilage of the rib, passed through the inferior lobe of the left lung, the track being marked by a depressed narrow cicatrix. It then perforated the pericardium under the heart, and sliced a piece out of the outer edge of the right ventricle, which being attached below, turned over and hung down from the heart to the extent of two inches when

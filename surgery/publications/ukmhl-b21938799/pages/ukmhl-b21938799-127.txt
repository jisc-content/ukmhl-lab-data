CHAPTER VI. GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE DIAPHRAGM. In the Report on the Medical and Surgical History of the British Army in the Crimea, vol. ii, page 317, it is stated that “ it occasionally happened that both chest and belly had been wounded/’ One case is detailed, that of Dolan; and another is mentioned to have occurred in the 4th Regiment. The first died on the tenth day, and the other sixteen hours after being wounded; hut no case is recorded where a hernia of the abdominal organs had taken place into the pleural cavity. There appears to he a doubt as to whether Corporal Burke, 18th Regiment, was a case of rupture of the diaphragm without an external wound. In the case of Greenfield, from India, there is every reason to suppose that the diaphragm was wounded on the left side, as the wound into the chest was so low that it was difficult to say whether the food passed out from the oesophagus or from the stomach just at its entrance. In Private Balloon’s case it is probable that there was a wound of the diaphragm on the right side. When the diaphragm is wounded, the floating viscera of the abdomen sometimes pass into the pleural cavity, and Mr. Guthrie is of opinion “ these wounds never heal, but remain open ever after. When the diaphragm is wounded in the neighbourhood of the liver or spleen, adhesions may take place so as to prevent hernial protrusion.” It is always worthy of note, whether the wound is on the left or the right side, as to the probability of a hernia occur- ring, this being more liable to take place on the left than the right side. There are three specimens of this rare and interesting descrip-

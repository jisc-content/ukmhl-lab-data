CHAPTER XIY. GUNSHOT INJURY OF THE LARGER ARTERIES, NOT BEING AT THE SAME TIME CASES OF COMPOUND FRACTURE. Under, this head one was admitted and invalided from India. It is, however, probable that the case of Private Bulger, which is detailed at page 134, is of this nature. It is seldom that primary haemorrhage occurs on the field of battle, even though the ball may have passed directly through the course of a large artery. This is in some measure accounted for, although not entirely, by the round form and the strong elastic coats, but especially by the mobility of the vessel. Arteries and veins firmly bound to bone are more likely to be injured than those that are lying loose in the fleshy parts of a limb; for instance, the femoral on the brim of the pelvis. The coats of the veins, being thinner than the artery, are much more readily injured, and primary haemorrhage proceeds more frequently from them than from the arteries. Only 14 such are returned amongst the men during the whole period of the Crimean war, and one in an officer. The following preparation is a beautiful example of the elas- ticity and toughness of the coats of both artery and vein, and likewise of the mobility of these vessels, allowing of being pushed aside by the ball. No. 408 (see Plate IX, fig. 3). Portion of the femoral artery and vein, between which a ball has passed, causing mortification of the limb, and death.â€”Donor, J. Guthrie, Esq., D.I.G. This specimen was taken from Private P. Tumbrill, of the Grenadiers of the 74th Regiment, of good stature, who was wounded on April 10th, 1814, by a musket ball, passing from the inside to the out- side of the middle of the thigh; he says it bled considerably at

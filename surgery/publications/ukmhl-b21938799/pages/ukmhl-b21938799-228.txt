CHAPTER XV. GUNSHOT WOUNDS, WITH DIRECT INJURY OF THE LARGE NERVES, NOT BEING AT THE SAME TIME CASES OF COMPOUND FRAC- TURE. Nine cases were admitted, 3 were sent to duty, 2 to mo- dified duty, and 4 invalided. All were wounds of the brachial plexus. In one there was complete paralysis of the arm, with a partial fracture of the scapula. In two the paralysis was only partial. In one case the arm hung powerless by the patient’s side, without the slightest sensation or power of motion, and the temperature much diminished. In the other two cases the impaired condition of their arms, al- though not to such a great extent, w?as yet very nearly so. Various treatment wTas adopted,—blisters, galvanism, friction, cold and salt-water baths, &c., without the slightest benefit. Large nerves, like arteries, generally escape being wounded by musket balls. When they are injured, paralysis of the limb, to a greater or less extent, comes on, along with numbness and wasting of the muscles of the extremity, as occurred in the following case:— Private Peter Clear, wounded at Cawmpore, November 28th, 1857, by a musket ball, which entered the posterior part of right shoulder, above the spine of the scapula, and caused a partial fracture of this bone, and passed directly forwards, and wras cut out immediately above the centre of the right clavicle August 16th, 1858.—Wound healed. He has entirely lost the sense of feeling and of motion in this arm, which hangs quite powerless by his side. Temperature diminished, and the in- teguments are bedewed with a cold, clammy perspiration. November 23rd.—Invalided. 78th Regiment.—Private John Daniels, wounded at Lucknow by a musket ball, which entered below the right scapula, and

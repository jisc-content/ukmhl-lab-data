98 GUNSHOT WOUNDS OP TIIE DIAPHRAGM. The case of Sergeant Denis Barry, who was wounded in nearly the same situation, where there was also a hernia of the stomach and colon into the thorax, and continued to do his duty as a soldier for nearly twenty-two years, shows how little inconvenience he also experienced. Had the exact state of things been accurately diagnosed during life, what steps could have been taken for his relief? Would a surgeon be warranted in cutting into the abdomen and reducing the hernia? In this case it would have been impossible, on account of adhesions of the displaced viscera to the surrounding parts. The diagnosis of such a displacement would be extremely diffi- cult, if not impossible. There was, in January, 1847, under my care in this hospital, a patient wounded in nearly the same situation, viz.:â€”Private Thomas Eallv, set. 25, was wounded on the 29th December, 1813, at Marajpore, by a grape shot, which entered about three inches below and to the outer side of the left nipple, between the eighth and ninth ribs; it was cut out shortly after the accident, behind and at the angle of the eleventh rib. He suffered severely from pleuritis of the left side in 1844. His general health is now (January, 1847) good, and he has no complaint except shortness of breathing, or rather uneasiness in his chest, when wearing his knapsack and cross-belts. It is probable that the diaphragm was wounded in this case also; if so, the wound may possibly have closed, or pleuritic adhesions have formed and prevented a hernial protrusion. If, however, Eally was seized in the same manner as Fletcher, after all other means had failed, should operative measures be resorted to ? I am disposed to think that few surgeons would be inclined to undertake such an operation from the great un- certainty as to the state of the parts that might exist.

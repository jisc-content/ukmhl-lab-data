188 AMPUTATION OF TIIE and inferior; and the second by anterior and posterior flaps; but cither method may be modified by a skilful surgeon so as to suit any case. Both methods are, however, equally applicable in military practice, as immediate amputation is most generally required when the shaft or head of the bone has been fractured, and consequently no leverage can be obtained by the shaft ot the bone. Therefore, in most cases of gunshot wounds of the head of the humerus, the incisions will be required to be made from without inwards, and not by transfixion. The superior and inferior flaps are generally performed in the following manner, according as to which arm has to be amputated :—A strong straight bistoury, or small amputating knife, should be inserted in front of the acromion process (if on the left arm, and the reverse if on the right), and a semilunar incision made backwards to about the centre of the fleshy part of the shoulder; this flap is then dissected upwards, the joint entered and disarticulated, and an inferior flap formed. The most important part of the operation is that the assistant follows the knife (in making the last flap) with the palm of his hand, so,as to grasp securely the brachial artery. Anterior and posterior flaps may be made according to the state of the soft parts and condition of the head of the humerus; but in either method care must be taken to preserve enough of covering. Anterior and Posterior Flaps.—When the left arm has to be amputated, the point of the knife should be placed in front of the posterior fold of the axilla, and carried upwards and forwards until its point appears just in front of the acromion ; the knife should be then carried with a sawing motion down- wards, backwards, and outwards, so as to make a flap four or five inches in length, formed chiefly of the posterior part of the deltoid. On the assistant having raised this flap, the articu- lation should be opened into by cutting the tendons which are inserted into the head of the humerus. By judicious move- ments of the arm the head of the bone is easily disarticulated (if there is no fracture of the neck of the bone), and the knife is then passed in front of the bone, and then carried downwards and forwards to form an anterior flap about the same length as the other. Immediately before cutting the axillary artery

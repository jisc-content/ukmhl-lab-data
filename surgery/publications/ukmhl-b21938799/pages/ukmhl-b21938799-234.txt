CHAPTER XVIII. AMPUTATIONS. In gunshot wounds the surgeon must be cautious not to con- demn a limb too hastily, as it will present quite a different appearance when the splintered pieces of bone, the coagulated blood, and dirt have been removed. There can be no doubt that amputation is necessary when a limb is carried oft' and a rugged stump only left; when it is completely disorganized by round shot, though still left adherent; when a large extent of soft parts are carried awray along with the principal vessels, even although the bone remains uninjured; and also in the greater number of cases of compound commi- nuted fractures of the femur. Besides the cases on which there can be no doubt of the pro- priety of the instant removal of the limb, there are others of doubtful character; still it is advocated by some surgeons that this would diminish the amount of mortality, if immediate amputa- tion w^as performed on these also, although it cannot be denied that in some of these doubtful cases a very useful limb might be saved. These cases w ill be more fully explained afterwards. Military surgeons have divided amputation into primary and secondary: the primary are those that are performed within the first twenty-four hours, before inflammation has taken place in the injured parts; and secondary amputation, those that are performed after the inflammation has set in. Some surgeons have a third division, or “ intermediate amputations,” which are those performed from the twenty-fourth hour until suppu- ration has taken place. This, however, is rather difficult to follow in practice, and it is not generally adopted. The mortality after primary amputations in civil practice is greater than after secondary operations; while in military practice the case is

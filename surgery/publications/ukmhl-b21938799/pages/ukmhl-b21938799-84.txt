50 SABRE AND BAYONET elevations and depressions, and a puckered cicatrix with a notch in the superciliary ridge marking the entrance of the ball. The sight of the eye is good, and he is in robust health. He is of sound mind and perfectly rational so long as he abstains from liquor. Donor, Dr. W illiamson, S.S. IV. Sabre and Bayonet Wounds of the Head. Simple Incised or Lacerated Wounds of the Scalp caused by Sabre Cut, or by the Bayonet, but with- out Fracture of the Skull. Simple incised or lacerated -wounds of the scalp from sabre cuts should be brought together by adhesive plaster, and every portion of the scalp which has been detached from the bone should be saved, so as to afford protection and nourishment to the subjacent parts and to hasten the cure. In some cases, however, it may be necessary to insert sutures to retain the parts in apposition, but this ought to be avoided as much as possible. When the flap of the scalp takes place from above downwards, or when its base of attachment is large, it reunites more quickly than when it is raised in the opposite direction, on account of the principal nutrient vessels not being divided. When punctured wounds occur on the upper part of the cranium, between the scalp and bone, a puffy erysipelatous swelling, with tension and tenderness of the scalp, is very liable to ensue. For the relief of this, the chief treatment consists in free incisions, to allow of the discharges of blood from the arteries, and also to prevent the formation or lodgment of matter over the bone. The erysipelatous inflammation which is so extremely liable to occur in wounds of the scalp, is thought to depend upon the peculiarly dense texture of the scalp and on the tendinous expansion of the occipito frontalis muscle. The use of stitches and adhesive plaster has also been said to be the cause of ery- sipelas, but this disease frequently supervenes where neither have been used. The treatment is that usually employed in injuries of the head.

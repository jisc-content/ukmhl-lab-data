CHAPTER V. GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE CHEST. Simple flesh contusions or wounds from gunshot, bayonet, or sabre, &c., demand peculiar attention, only from the danger of inflammation being set up in the contained organs. In some cases there is an injury of the bony or cartilaginous parietes without lesion of contents. A ball may strike the ribs and pass out a little posterior to the entrance; the patient may spit up blood at the time, or even afterwards; or the bone may become necrosed, and still the lung or pleura may not be directly injured, and these patients generally recover. A ball sometimes runs round under the skin, leaving a dark, livid appearance along its track in the muscles or even between the ribs, and makes its exit on the opposite side, and where, to all appearance, it has gone right through the lung, and bloody sputa still further confirms this opinion. Sometimes a ball strikes against the coat or shirt, and is withdrawn unperceived, and may thus be mistaken for a case of penetrating wound and the ball lodged. In some cases of gunshot wounds penetrating the chest the ball is lodged, or apparently lodged. There are cases on record where balls and other extraneous bodies have been lodged in the lung, or lying loose in the cavity of the chest for years, without causing any serious disturbance to the patient; still this is far from the usual result, as death generally ensues unless the foreign body is removed, and when it does lodge, a cyst is formed by adhesive inflammation, and thus shuts it out from the rest of the system. A ball, a piece of cloth, or any other foreign substance which has been driven into the cavity of the pleura, generally gives rise to inflammation and suppura- tion, and ultimately death, unless removed by operation.

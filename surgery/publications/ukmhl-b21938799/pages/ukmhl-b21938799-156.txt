CHAPTER IX. GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE BACK AND SPINE. Gunshot wounds with fracture of the vertebra without lesion of the spinal cord are in general very tedious and slow to cure; sinuses form along the spine and are very troublesome; the spinous or transverse processes become carious; balls and pieces of cloth are sometimes lodged, and require free incision for their removal. Ten have been admitted: six have been discharged to duty, and four invalided; all were the result of musket balls; one was a case of fracture of the ilium and spinous process of the lumbar vertebrae, with the wounds still unhealed. One with fracture of the spinous process of the dorsal vertebrae; wounds still open. Two cases of wounds of the sacrum; in one of them the wound was still open, and a probe could be passed right across from the one aperture to the other. The last was a wound of the spinous process of the lumbar vertebrae, also still unhealed. The two following cases are examples of this description of wound. 93rd Regiment.â€”Sergeant James Munro; wounded at Luck- now by a musket ball through the loins; the ball entered a little behind and below the crest of the left ilium, and passed a little upwards and backwards, nearly across the back, and made its exit immediately above the crest of the right ilium; nume- rous pieces of bone came away from both apertures. Shortly after the injury the urine was tinged with blood, and it is doubt- ful whether the two last vertebrae are injured. 12th July. The aperture of exit of ball has closed; that of entrance is still open and discharging, and the probe can be introduced for a considerable distance, but bare bone is not detected; he is

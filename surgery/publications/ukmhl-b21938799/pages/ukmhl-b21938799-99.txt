WOUNDS OE THE PACE. (J5 II. Penetrating, Perforating, or Lacerating the Bony Structure, without Lesion of important Organs. Gunsliot wounds of the face are frequently of a serious nature, and tedious in cure, producing fractures of the various hones, the hall being impacted in the nostril or antrum, so as to resist every attempt at immediate removal, until, after months or years, it may have become loosened and drop down from its original position, by its own weight, on to the palate, and where it may be extracted through the mouth, as in the case from which preparation No. 2955 was taken.

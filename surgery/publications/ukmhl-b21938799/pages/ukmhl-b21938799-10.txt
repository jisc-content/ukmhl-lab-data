VI PREFACE. be found for ascertaining the results of different wars, in the several classes and species of wounds, and in the pro- portion which those classes and species bear to each other, and to the total by all wounds. The collection and record of such results seem to me to be always very desirable; and I have availed myself of the opportunity alluded to as regards the wounded by the mutiny in India. The follow- ing pages contain the result of my labours. I feel that they might have been made more valuable and interesting had similar accurate records existed of the invalids wounded by former wars, with which I could have compared data, and so have drawn more comprehensive information, statistical and surgical. I am in hopes, however, that some points worthy of notice have been elicited ; and, for example, I may refer to the large number of gunshot com- pound fracture of the femur, where the patients have recovered with good, useful limbs, as compared with the number of thigh-stump cases, and the total by all wounds. “ This very satisfactory feature in the classified return of invalided wounded by the mutiny, appears to me perhaps not uncommon for Indian wars, but certainly very much so for European wars, as far as records enable me to make the comparison. This difference in favour of results by Indian wars I believe to be mainly due to the facilities afforded by the dooley for the successful treatment of this severest of all forms of compound fracture. Eleven cases recovered, with good, useful limbs, out of the total wounded landed from India—viz., 842. This is a large proportion compared with the result of the Crimean war, viz., 8 out of 229G.” Medical officers who have served in India are, I believe, unanimous in opinion, that there is no means of transit for

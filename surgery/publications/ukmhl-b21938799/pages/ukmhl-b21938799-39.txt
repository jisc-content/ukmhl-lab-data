7 GUNSHOT WOUNDS IN GENERAL. is situated; examining the clothes as to whether any part has been carried in, as the ball may only have gone a short distance, and then dropped out under the clothes. Two apertures on opposite sides of the limb cannot be taken as decisive evidence of the ball having perforated, as they may be caused by two separate balls; occasionally, also, one ball makes several aper- tures. The different kinds of forceps which have been invented for the extraction of bullets are innumerable, but it appears to me that the simplest are the best—viz., the common lever, with finger acting as probe and director, and the common dressing or polypus forceps. There are also some other more complicated instruments, which are, in some difficult cases, of great service, such as Coxeter’s or Read’s forceps. Patients, soon after being wounded, seldom object to the ex- traction of the bullet, however reluctant they may be after months or years of a state of things of which they have become accustomed to, with all the attendant evils, such as pains, gleety discharges, &c.; still, when they have been persuaded to have the ball extracted, they express themselves as very much delighted.

CHAPTER III. WOUNDS OF THE FACE. I. Simple Flesh Contusions and Wounds. In cases of incised wounds of the face, one of the chief objects is to prevent scars. After the wound has been cleaned, the edges should be brought in apposition by the twisted suture upon thin harelip pins, or the interrupted suture, are the best modes of dressing. When in the neighbourhood of the eyelids, the interrupted suture or merely court plaster should be employed, as the twisted suture cannot be used in consequence of the mobility and the receding of the eyelids behind the margin of the orbit, and also from its causing irritation to the eye itself; as cicatrization takes place, eversion of the eyelids must be guarded against. In wounds of the face there is generally con- siderable bleeding, which, in some cases, may require the appli- cation of a ligature, or when in the lips, harelip pins may be inserted. When the wound is perpendicular, the parotid duct and branches of the portio dura may be divided, in the one case leading to a salivary fistula, and in the other to paralysis of one side of the face. In a fistulous opening in the cheek, the margin should be brought together and pressure applied. When the aperture into the mouth has closed in a case of sali- vary fistula of some standing, it may be necessary to make a fresh opening into the mouth, so as to allow of the secretion from the parotid to flow into the mouth, and then to endeavour to close the external aperture. The margins of the aperture are often hard and indurated, requiring to be excised before union can be effected.

CHAPTER XXI. TRANSPORTATION OF SICK AND WOUNDED. This is a subject demanding the attention of every military surgeon; although not exclusively of a professional nature, still it ought to be one of his special care. It is a matter of the greatest importance during an action, and is one of the chief difficulties in the operations of all armies, not only affecting the wounded themselves, but also the whole army. Numbers of men fall out under the pretence of attending to a wounded comrade or officer, when they ought to remain in the ranks doing their duty. There is now an Army Hospital Corps, to attend upon the sick and wounded in field and general hospitals, &c. The Military Train has in charge a fixed amount of the wheel and other means of transport, which now ought to do away with the colouring pretext under which some men for- merly left the field during action. It appears to me that it would be of advantage to have an Ambulance Corps, and a certain number of men, under <iperma- nent military officer, belonging to the Military Train, and appointed specially for this particular duty, so that he might be held responsible for the proper equipment of every description of conveyance for the sick and wounded under all circumstances. The horses used for ordinary purposes in the waggons of the Military Train will not remain quiet under litieres and cacalets; and further, the horses for conveyances of this description should be trained daily to carry some such load; as not one horse in a hundred, in anything like good condition, would carry a litiere swinging on its back. Still, it may be remarked that horses during a campaign arc not generally so very fresh as in the time of peace.

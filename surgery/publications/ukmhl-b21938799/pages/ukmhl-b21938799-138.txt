100 WOUNDS OF THE nEAllT AND GREAT VESSELS. in the fresh state, the part of the ventricle from which it had been sliced being puckered and covered by a serous membrane like the heart itself. The lance then penetrated the central tendon of the diaphragm, making an oval opening, easily ad- mitting the finger, the edges being smooth and well defined. It then entered the liver, on the surface of which there was a small irregular mark or cicatrix. The heart in front wTas at- tached to the pericardium by some strong bands, the result of adhesive inflammation, but the general appearance of the serous membrane showed that this had not been either great or exten- sive. The donor, Mr. Guthrie, remarks: “ If this man had lived long enough, he might have furnished an instance of hernia of the stomach or of intestine into the pericardium.” In the truth of this remark few surgeons would now concur. No. 174.—A punctured wound of the right ventricle, close to the apex. Instant death. No. 403.—Abdominal aorta showing a horizontal wound through its coats, caused by the point of a bayonet. Death three hours after. A European was admitted after the battle of Sadoolapore, in 1849, with rupture of the septum cardis, but without any wound of the chest or fracture of ribs. He had been struck with a cannon shot immediately over the breast, and under the nipple on the left side. The chest presented the appearance of only a very slight bruise, the skin not being rubbed off; how- ever, he appeared dying; pulse small, frequent, and feeble; sur- face cold and moist; countenance anxious. Stimulants, opium, &c., were of no use, and after four days he died. The post- mortem examination showed ecchymosis under the skin, ecchy- mosis of the anterior surface of the heart, and on laying it open, the septum cardis was found ruptured, so that the finger could be passed from one ventricle to the other, through a jagged and ruptured opening.

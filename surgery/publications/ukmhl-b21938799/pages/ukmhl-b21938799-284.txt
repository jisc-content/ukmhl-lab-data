2 32 EXCISION OP THE Many different methods of exposing the upper part of the femur have been recommended, but a good sound knowledge of anatomy will best enable the surgeon to suit his proceeding to each particular case. One straight incision or a semilunar one will in general be sufficient. One method, the patient being placed on his side, a deep incision with a strong bistoury should be made from above downwards over it, and on to the outer side of the femur through the skin and muscles; the fractured portion of the head or neck of the bone should be removed by the strong forceps; 'or if in a case of disease, the head, neck, and trochanter major, may be isolated and thoroughly turned out of the wound by twisting the limb over the opposite thigh, and a common saw applied to effect excision of the upper portion of the femur to whatever extent is required. A second method is to make a semilunar incision about two or three inches above the trochanter, its ends being so limited as not to interfere with the crural nerve in front or the gluteal artery behind; from the centre of the cavity thus formed a straight line of incision should be carried downwards over the trochanter; the knife should then be carried deep, and a flap turned forwards and another backwards, so as to expose the upper portion of the trochanter; the neck of the bone, and capsular ligament, and the muscles situated close to the joint should then be freely cut and the capsule opened on its outer aspect, when, by twisting the thigh across the other and rotating it outwards at the same time, the head of the bone will start from its socket, and the round ligament cut with a knife (if not already de- stroyed) and the diseased parts either removed by the gouge or saw. The lever force is however wanting in gunshot fractures. If the incisions are carried too far in front or behind, great injury may be inflicted on the nerve or vessels, and both should be care- fully avoided. There is little to be feared from the haemorrhage ; the only large arteries are the gluteal and its branches. The after treatment consists chiefly in quietude, the use of a splint, and water dressing.

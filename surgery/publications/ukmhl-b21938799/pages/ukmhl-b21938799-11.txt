PREFACE. vii sick and wounded equal to the dooley; and should this be admitted by the public and the Government., there seems no reason why our Indian subjects should not furnish us with a supply of doolies and bearers in all our wars out of India. That such a means of transport would be ex- pensive, must be admitted; but probably not so very much more expensive than the means usually supplied. The difference would not, I believe, be grudged by the public, who would find their satisfaction in the more favorable results amongst the severer classes of cases of invalided wounded arriving at the depot. Advantage has been taken of the valuable preparations on this subject contained in the Museum of the Army Medical Department, to illustrate these notes. Every pre- paration of gunshot wound contained in the Museum has been detailed in the following pages up to 1859. The specimens have been carefully described, and the history of the cases detailed as fully as possible, and several lithogra- phic drawings have also been inserted. This, it is hoped, may be of some use, as informing the profession of what preparations of gunshot and other injuries received in action the Museum at Netley contains. Gosport; December, 1863. G.

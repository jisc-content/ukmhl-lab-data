Priapism and loss of the sexual powers has also been observed in injuries of the cranium. IX. Treatment of Gunshot Injuries of the Head. The treatment of concussion and compression has already been described. All cases w here inflammation of the brain or its membranes is to be dreaded after removing its cause, should be treated on the strictest antiphlogistic principle; bleeding from the arm, leeches to the head, opening the temporal artery or jugular vein, shaving the head, and applying ice or other cold lotion, such as this,â€”composed of 4 ozs. of nitrate of potash, 2 ozs. of muriate of ammonia, 1 pint of vinegar, and 10 pints of Avater. With regard to the mode of dressing in gunshot wounds of the head, a piece of fine wet linen is first applied, wrhich adheres to the wound, and should not be frequently removed. Over this Stromeyer recommends that a net, made for the purpose, should be placed, so as to retain the dressing, and the cold applications are to be made through the net. Patients labouring under wounds of the head are frequently so restless that the wet lint is quickly tossed off, so that the suggestion of Stromeyer appears to be worthy of being generally adopted. Internally purgatives, calomel until it begins to affect the mouth, given in two-grain doses every four or five hours according to cir- cumstances, and mercurial ointment rubbed into the thighs so as quickly to affect the system; at a late period blisters to the head or to the nape of the neck, and also a seton, should be the means employed, according as the case may require.

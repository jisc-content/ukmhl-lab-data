16-1 GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Penetrating, Perforating, or Lacerating the several Structures of the Tarsus and Metatarsus. Gunshot wounds of tarsus and metatarsus give rise to caries in different bones, which generally results in contraction of the tendons and muscles of the feet; in the same manner as occurs in the carpus and metacarpus, and require the same mode of treatment. 18 were admitted under this head, of whom 6 were sent to duty, 4 to modified duty, 8 invalided. 11 were produced by musket ball, and 1 by round shot; only one remained unhealed. Two wTent through the calcaneum; one across the fleshy part of the sole of the foot; two through the tarsus only. The one by round shot bruised the bones, but did not break the skin, and caused severe injuries to both the tarsus and metatarsus. In those cases that were invalided the bones had been fractured, and tendons and ligaments lacerated, so as to produce in some cases considerable contraction and loss of power in the foot. The following is an example of this injury:—24th Regi- ment.—Private Wm. Alexander, set. 21, wounded at Jehlurn, July 7tli, 1857, by a musket ball, which struck the outer side of the right calcaneum, passed through this bone, and made its exit on the inner side. On September 26th, 1857, an incision was made on the posterior part of the os calcis, and necrosed portions of bone were removed, saving the attachment of the tendo-Acliillis. August 2nd, 1858.—Wounds healed, but cannot bear his weight on the heel. 3rd.—Invalided.

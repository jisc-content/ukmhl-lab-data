235 INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. the saw or forceps. The limb should then be turned on the outer side and the internal lateral ligament divided, taking care not to wound the posterior tibial artery. The foot should now be dislocated outwards and backwards, and the lower end pro- truded through the wound; the lower ends of the tibia and also of the articular surface of the astragalus are to he removed by the saw, and the cut surfaces of the tibia and astragalus kept in close approximation, and the limb placed on a splint and dressed in the usual manner. Astragalus. Mr. Turner, of Manchester, states that out of eighteen cases of dislocation of this bone, where complete excision of the dis- placed bone was performed, fourteen made good recoveries, and in one only was there anchylosis. Os CALCIS. When the disease is in the posterior, lower, or outer aspect of the bone; then either partial or complete excision may be resorted to with every prospect of success. Great freedom can be taken on the outside, while on the inner greater care must be taken to avoid the vessels and nerves. The bone can be dissected out from behind in injury or disease. A semilunar incision down to the bone from the pos- terior angle of the internal malleolus should be made across the foot; this flap is to be turned back, and the tendo Achillis cut across; also the ligaments which connect the astragalus and os calcis should be divided, and all the interosseous ligaments cut across and the bone dissected out. The only vessel requiring ligature will be the posterior tibial artery. Tarsus and Metatarsus. In gunshot wounds of these parts the ball should be ex- tracted and the fractured portions removed, and the wound treated according to the general principles of surgery. When it is thought that the disease is limited to one bone, the re-

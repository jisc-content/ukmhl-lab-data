GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE NECK. 73 process, an incision was made downwards to the spinous processes, but no metallic substance could be detected. August 30tli.—Duty. No. 2915.—Preparation of the atlas and axis, showing frac- tures of the anterior arch of the former, from a gunshot wound. From Private F. Boyle, 12th Regiment. Received a gunshot wound on the 3rd December, 1854, in an attack made on a stockade erected by a body of gold-diggers on the gold field of Ballarat, for the purpose of resisting the constituted authorities. The ball entered the left side of the nose superiorly, and passing downwards and backwards, came into contact with the atlas, producing a comminuted fracture of the bone anteriorly, and a simple fracture posteriorly, and displacing to a con- siderable extent the fragment of the bone. A very short time after receiving the above wound a clumsily formed conical bullet was discharged by the mouth, and, some days afterwards, the man complained of severe pain behind the jaw on the right side, and directed attention to a hard body in the vicinity, which, he conjectured, must have been either a second bullet or the cap of the one voided, and he wished to have it removed. It was only after death that the supposed foreign body was found to be the transverse process of the atlas. Con- sidering the nature of the injury, it is a matter of surprise that the man should have lived thirty days after receiving it. It is evident that an incautious movement of the head might at any time have terminated life by causing greater displacement of the bones and so compressing the spinal marrow. He died on the 12tli January, 1855.

CHAPTER II. GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE HEAD. Wounds of the substance of the brain, and also those of the cranium and scalp, are of a most serious character, and require very great attention and skill on the part of a surgeon engaged in civil practice, but more especially that of a military surgeon. After an action wounds of the head do not form the greatest proportion of the cases, as very many of them are killed instantly, or die before they can receive medical assistance. Wounds of the head are much more frequent when soldiers are employed in trenches during a siege, or in cavalry engagements, than in action amongst infantry. These injuries may be divided intoâ€” L Gunshot Injuries producing Concussion or Compression with Contusion or Fracture of the Cranium without depression, and with or without any Seal'p Wound. Concussion. Compression. Suppuration. Necrosis. Extravasation. Fracture without depression; also Fissure, or counter-frac- ture. Fracture of the external table only. Fracture of the inner or vitreous table only. II. With Contusion or Fracture of the Cranium, with depression or displacement of both tables. III. Penetrating or Perforating the Cranium and its contents.

216 AMPUTATION OP THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. or by sawing through any of the bones, so that plenty of flap or covering can be preserved. Three cases of amputation through the medio-tarsus arrived from India. In one the operation was performed three hours and a half after the injury, caused by a musket ball through the arch of the foot. In the other the operation was performed twelve days after the accident. In both cases the stumps were good. In a third case of Chop art’s operation on the foot, the heel was very much carried backwards, so as to bring the line of incision nearly on to the ground when the man attempted to put the stump to the ground to use it in progression. The tendo Achillis was divided, and the heel brought forcibly downwards, so that the weight can be taken upon the extremity of the os calcis, and a boot with an apparatus, so adapted as to prevent a return to the faulty position, has been applied. The astragalus appears to have been removed in this case; but it was sent home from India as a Chopart’s operation. Amputation of the Toes. The remarks made under the head of amputation of the fingers are applicable to the toes, and the same oval method should be adopted; and any surgeon can so form his incisions for any particular case, only always bearing in mind that it is necessary and incumbent upon him to preserve as much of the foot as possible, having at the same time a due regard to the removal of the whole, injured, or diseased parts.

Gunshot Injuries producing Concussion or Compression with Contusion or Fracture of the Cranium, and with or without any Scalp Wound. Concussion. The brain is occasionally merely temporarily disturbed in its function by external injuries, without any appreciable lesion to its structure. Its function is at first impaired, and is ultimately restored, more or less completely, should it escape inflammation of the membranes or substance. The entire brain undergoes a number of vibrations and mo- mentary compressions, of various degrees of amount, in every case of concussion where the cranium remains entire, and without any depressed portion of bone. Concussion may be either caused by a direct blow on the head, or from falling on the feet, the shock being communicated to the brain. The cir- culation and functions of the brain are generally only suspended for a short time, but on some occasions the patient remains in- sensible for several hours. The concussion may be so severe as

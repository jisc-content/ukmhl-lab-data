113 PENETRATING OR PERFORATING. result of the injury ? Probably the latter influence is consider- able ; as it has been remarked, and I believe truly, that under 'perforation of the intestines by ulceration there is not only con- traction in caliber, but marked shortening of the intestinal canal. This action beyond the peristaltic may be expected, and really appears to follow equally perforations by injury and disease, thus explaining the withdrawal of the wounded points of intes- tine from the line of the ball, as indicated by the orifices of entrance and exit. In a case that came under the observation of Deputy Inspector- General T. Alexander, C.B., the small intestines were found to have been wounded sixteen times ;* and in preparation No. 1272 the small intestines are perforated four times and the mesentery twice. No. 1272.—Gunshot wound of the small intestines and mesen- tery, the former wounded in three places, and the latter in one. Death twenty-four hours after the accident. No. 1125.—A gunshot wound of the large curvature of the stomach. The man lived eight hours after the accident. * Mr. Guthrie’s ‘ Commentaries/ p. 576. 8

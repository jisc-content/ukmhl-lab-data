154 GUNSHOT WOUNDS OE THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. during the month under report, is now 743, of which number 178 are cases of amputation or excision. The total above referred to includes only Cavalry and Infantry of the Line; but thirteen of the Royal Engineer Corps, wounded during the mutiny in India, have also arrived at Chatham, and have been disposed of at the head-quarters of their corps at this station. A nominal and descriptive roll of eight of these thir- teen cases was appended to the monthly report for January last, and a similar roll of the five arrived since is appended to this (vide p. 315). The total thirteen cases includes only two am- putation cases, both being of the arm after gunshot wound. During June, 1859, the addition of two cases of gunshot frac- ture of the femur to those previously arrived, led to the observation of the very large proportion of these cases to the total wounded, and on the striking difference in the proportion of these cases to thigh stump cases, as compared with the number and proportion of such cases furnished by similar returns of invalided wounded from the late war in the Crimea, contained in the Chatham Annual Medical Report for 1856-7. The number and proportion which these gunshot fractured femur cases bear to each other and to the total invalided wounded, seem to be of statistical value, as bearing on the question of the expediency, or otherwise, of amputation in that description of wound. In the following tables these statistics are set forth, together with similar data collected from the records at Fort Pitt, of the invalided of preceding wars in India.

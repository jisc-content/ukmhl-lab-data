CHAPTER XII. GUNSHOT WOUNDS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Simple Flesh Contusions and Wounds. The treatment of these wounds in the lower is the same as in the upper extremities, hut as an example of their frequency, &c., the following results will show. Slight, 117; severe, 13; total, 130. 01 the total 130 cases, 90 were sent to duty; 15 to modified duty; 25 invalided. On comparing the number of gunshot wounds of the upper with that of the lower extremities, it will he noticed that they are very nearly the same, viz., 212 in the upper, and 234 in the lower. There is, however, a considerable difference as to the number ol flesh gunshot wounds, there being 130 in the lower, and only 59 in the upper extremities. 5 were shell wounds; 8 by grape shot; 1 by a brickbat; 1 by a rifle ball; and the remainder by musket ball. 12 were wounded in the hip; 26 in the thigh; and 62 in the leg. In 2 cases balls were ex- tracted from the fleshy part of the thigh, at Fort Pitt; and in another case from the perimeum, immediately over the bulb of the urethra, the ball having entered on the outer side of the thigh, opposite the trochanter major; in 3 cases the wounds were very close to the femoral artery; and in 1 the ball still remains in the thigh. This man is returned under “ Amputation of the Finger,” but the other wound is interest- ing, and is noticed in this place ; the ball must have grazed the femoral artery and vein; on inserting a probe into the fistulous opening, the ball could be distinctly felt deep behind the artery. Of the 13 severe cases, 1 was by a ball which is lodged in the tuberosity of the ischium; 2 were from round shot in the thigh, followed by sloughing; several were ball and shell wounds in

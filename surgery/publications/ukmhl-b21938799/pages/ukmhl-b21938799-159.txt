CHAPTER X. GUNSHOT CONTUSIONS AND WOUNDS OF THE PERINEUM, AND GENITAL AND URINARY ORGANS, NOT BEING, AT THE SAME TIME, WOUNDS OF THE PERITONEUM. Wounds of the testicle and spermatic cord are not unfre- quent, and usually heal rapidly; but the portion which remains is often of little use, although the patient does not like to lose it. When the urethra has been wounded, a moderate-sized catheter should be kept in, to assist, during the healing of the parts, in preventing contraction of the canal. Spent round shot striking the pubis sometimes causes para- lysis of the bladder, without producing any external wound. Wounds of the bladder by musket ball are very dangerous, but not necessarily fatal. When the bladder is wounded where it is uncovered by peritoneum, the patient generally recovers; but when the wound in the bladder is at any part that is covered by peritoneum, the case is almost certain to terminate fatally, from extravasation of urine and consequent general peritonitis. In all these cases a catheter should be at once in- troduced into the bladder, and retained there until the urine ceases to flow from the wound; the urine should be allowed to drop out of the catheter nearly as fast as it passes into the bladder. The catheter should not be introduced too far into the bladder, lest it excites inflammation of the bladder, or rise above the urine, which might collect below it, and at last escape through the wound. Inflammatory symptoms are to be combated by general and local bleeding, enemata, and gentle aperients, and opium given, so as to produce some effect on the system. When a ball lodges in the bladder or prostate, it ought to be removed by operation through the perineum.

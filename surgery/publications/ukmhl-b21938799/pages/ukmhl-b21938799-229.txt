WOUNDS, WITII INJURY OF LARGE NERVES. ] 79 passed out about two inches further forward; re-entered in the axilla, and came out about the middle of the inner edge of the deltoid. He was shot from behind while loading his firelock. July 13th.—Wounds healed. Loss of sensation and motion in arm, which is always covered with perspiration. August 5th.— Invalided. 42nd Regiment.—Sergeant Joseph Mumford, set. 28, on March 11th, 1858, received a wound from a musket ball (round), which entered about an inch and a half from the sternal articu- lation of the clavicle of right side, and was extracted from the left side of the neck behind, about the centre of the clavicle. The trachea was injured, and he spat blood for seven or eight days, and the air came out through the hole of entrance. The cervical plexus has been injured; the trachea, in the course of the wound, is tender, the opening of exit very much so, and all the fingers appear quite useless; they are fixed, apparently anchyloscd in a straight position, but any attempt at bending them causes intense pain in the course of the median nerve. The hand is cold, and affected with nervous tremor; all the fingers are numb, but the motions and sensation of the thumb are good. May, 1859.—Duty. Results of wound probably not to a disqualifying extent. 88th Regiment.—Private C. Walker, set. 30, was wounded on the 21st October, 1858, at Beurwah, by a musket ball through the back of the right thigh, passing across the popliteal space from without inwards, and apparently wounding the nerve, but not injuring the bone. The wound is healed, but the leg is atrophied and the foot extended ; asserts that he cannot put any weight on the foot; is unwilling evidently to do so. On the same date received another bullet wound in left leg, just below the tuberosity of the tibia, which partially fractured the bone, and made its exit over the fibula. Wound soundly healed. Invalided.

LOWER EXTREMITIES. . 199 some small pieces of the bone came away. Had this been done, it is probable that the forefinger and little finger would have remained useful. As it is, however, all the fingers are now stiff in the extended position, the ring finger by bony anchylosis to the metacarpus, and the other fingers by adhesion of tendons. The hand is almost utterly useless, and there is little or no pros- pect of improvement. This appears to be “ conservative sur- gery ” in the wrong direction. One excellent case presented itself of good conservative surgery. J. Conollv, 37tli Regiment, was wounded 2Gth October, 1858, at Shakdre, by two musket balls or slugs, one of which shattered the metacarpal bone of the right thumb, the second passing through the ball of the thumb. Notwithstanding the amount of injury to the bone, the thumb has been pre- served ; and although the power of flexing it is totally lost, it is most useful as an opponent to the thumb. Amputations of the Lower Extremities. Amputation at the Hip-Joint Is never performed except as a last resource; but with all its disadvantages, particularly in military practice, and also taking into account the extensive mutilation and dreadful shock which such an operation must cause, still it is matter of surprise that so many survive; and as far as data for the statistics of the operation can be relied on, it is believed that one patient out of three recovers. The femur must be fractured, at least as high as the trochanters, to render the operation warrantable, and should never be in cases of in- jury when the bone can be sawn through immediately below the trochanters, and where sufficient covering can be found. When this is the case in military practice, it is impossible to rotate the knee outwards or inwards, to show the head of the femur. This can all be easily accomplished on the dead subject, or where a tumour or any malignant disease extends to the head of the femur.

CHAPTER XX. THE NUMBER THAT ARE WOUNDED, AND THE PROPORTION THAT SURVIVE UNDER THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS. It is curious to remark the numbers that are wounded, and the proportion that survive under the different classes of gun- shot wounds. Take, for example, the total number of cases that arrived from India under wounds of the three large cavi- ties, up to March 31st, 1858 : Head, 15, or 2’48 per cent, of the total that arrived, viz., 603. Chest, 19, or 3T6 per cent. Abdomen, 8, or 1T5 per cent. The numbers from India do not represent the frequency or the mortality of gunshot wounds in those different regions; but from April 1st, 1855, to the end of the Crimean Avar,* the total wounded was 7153. Of these, in the— Head, 851 treated, or 1T9 per cent, of the entire wounded; 170 died, or 20 per cent, of those treated. Chest, 420 treated, or 5‘8 per cent, of the entire wounded; 118 died, or 28H per cent, of those treated. Abdomen, 235 treated, or 3'28 per cent, of the entire wounded; 131 died, or 55'7 per cent, of those treated. From this it would appear that gunshot wounds of the head (in siege operations, at least) are twice as frequent as those of the chest, and more than three times compared to the abdomen; while wounds of the chest are more than 8 per cent, more fatal than the same injury in the head, and gunshot wounds of the abdomen are 27 per cent, more fatal compared to those of the chest. * Vide Report.

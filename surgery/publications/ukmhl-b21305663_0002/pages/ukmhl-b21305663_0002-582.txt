ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. oiiti tlie feet *. In the rabbits, the subjects of my experiments, there was no wasting, no obvious derangement in the functions ot the viscera ; on the contrary, one of the subjects of the ex- periments had young in the course of eight weeks after she had been operated upon. Lobstein adopts the opinion of authors, that the different parts of the sympathetic nerves are sources of nervous energy, upon which the healthy functions of the viscera depend ; and that the ganglia are laboratories of nervous energy. He also supposes, that mental impressions operate through the medi- um of the semi-lunar ganglia, which he calls Cerebrum abo- minale. The nervous energy fs supposed to be diffused by the cel- lular tissue in which the very minute branches of the sympa- thetic nerve are lost; and, with the view of ascertaining the influence of the sympathetic nerve upon the organs upon which its branches are distributed, he killed dogs and cats, by wounding the spinal cord ; and having ascertained the animals to be deacj, he endeavoured to excite the sympathetic nerves, but the organs supplied from that source were not affected in the slightest manner; and by applying galvanism to the sym- pathetic nerves, the heart, stomach, and intestines, did not move; the peristaltic motion continued, but it was not all de- pendent on the galvanic stimulus. OF THE NERVES OF THE I.OINS, AND INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. The nerves of the loins and inferior extremities are derived from the sympathetic, lumbar, and sacral nerves. Of the Sympathetic Nerves. The Sympathetic Nerves, after supplying the abdomen, approach each other upon the anterior part of the lumbar vertebrae, between the psoas muscle and the tendinous crura of the diaphragm. These nerves descend, then pass over the â€¢anterior part of the os sacrum, at the inner sides of the fora- Journal de Medicine, 1810.

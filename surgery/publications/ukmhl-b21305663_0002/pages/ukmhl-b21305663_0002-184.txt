ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 146 urgent. This muscle also contributes to the erection of the glans penis ; by its pressure on the corpus cavernosum of the urethra, the blood is forced into the glans penis. After having removed the muscles of the perinaeum, the bulb of the urethra comes into view : it is in form somewhat like to a cone, projects backwards, and is very near to the intestinum rectum. The bulb is, in part, covered by means of the triangular ligament of the bladder. Of the Compressor Prostata, of Albinos. Anatomical authors differ very widely in their descriptions of this muscle. This muscle has been particularly described by Santorini and also by Albinus, in his Historia Muscu- lorum. SECTION IV. OF THE BLADDER OF URINE. The bladder is a musculo-membranous sac, situated in the pelvis, immediately behind the ossa pubis, which receives and contains, for a certain time, the urine. The size and figure of the bladder vary at different periods of life, and in the different sexes. The capacity of the bladder does not bear a ratio to the age of the individual; it is proportionally larger in an infant, and rises much higher above the ossa pubis; and may more readily be cut into, above the ossa pubis, without opening the cavity of the abdomen. The upper aperture of the pel- vis of the foetus is so small that the rectum, distended by the meconium, almost fills the whole pelvis. When a child is three or four years old, the pelvis has generally attained such a size as to admit the bladder. At the period of birth, the bladder, in form, is like to a pear, the broader part of which is uppermost : the neck of the bladder may be compared to the narrower end of the pear, and its length is nearly three times greater than the transverse diameter.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 60 Those pieces of bone connected with the inner membrane of the artery, sometimes attain the thickness of a half-crown piece, and encroach upon the cavity of the artery. The valves of the veins are formed by duplications of the internal coat, which project into the cavity of the veins ; and, according to Mr Hunter, there is a certain proportion of a tendinous substance which enters into the structure of the valves. The valves appear to differ in some after death, which seems to depend upon the degree of distention of the veins. The internal coat of the veins, though thinner than that of the arteries, is not so easily torn, and is more distensible ; and it may also be observed, that the inner membrane of the veins is very rarely ossified. Lastly, it may be observed, that there is no reason for sup- posing that the absorbent vessels take their origin immediate- ly from the arteries or from the veins. SECTION VIII. INFERENCES RESPECTING THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AND ITS CIRCULATION. Erom what has been stated respecting the nature of the blood, and the structure of the heart, arteries and veins, the following inferences may be drawn : la£, That the blood is the source from which every part of the body was formed, and is nourished, to supply the waste that is constantly going on in the animal frame, during the performance of its several functions. 2d, That the coagulation of the blood may have a great ef- fect in stopping bleeding. This I have seen exemplified in a very striking manner in many instances, and more especially in one I saw with Mr Allan and the late Mr J. Bell, in which a miller’s arm was torn off by a wheel. Though the axillary artery and vein, which are so near to the heart, and of so large a size, had been torn, two or three ounces of blood only were lost. Several of this man’s ribs had been broken,

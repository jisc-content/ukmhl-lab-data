OF THE BRAIN. 243 Epist. viii. brain soft externally as well as internally, and of a paler co- lour than usual; and there was nothing particular as to the grey or white matter of the bone. In two instances there was a small quantity of a reddish fluid within the ventricles of the brain; and, upon examining the brain, in one instance, there was about half an ounce of a colourless fluid at the base of the brain. In three persons there was a slight effu- sion of a colourless fluid between the membranes of the brain. The sinuses of the brain were much gorged with blood in the greater number of instances. Of the Consistence of the Human Brain. The brain has been usually described as a pulpy substance. It varies much in firmness in different individuals, and from a variety of circumstances. The younger a child, the softer is the brain^: in a foetus it is gelatinous. In cold-blooded animals, it is much softer than in the warm-blooded; hence it suffers less from pressure ap- plied to it. Much has been said respecting the consistence of the brain of maniacs. According to Meckel, it is harder than in the healthy stale. Morgagni * found it in some harder, but in others softer than in the healthy body. I have examined with much attention, the brains of three maniacs, without being able to discover any morbid appear- ances. The anatomical investigations of Greding, Haslam, Pi- xel, and others, have proved, that the same morbid appear- ances are discovered in the brains of maniacs, as in persons who have died from apoplexy, epilepsy or convulsions. The brain, in consequence of apoplexy, hydrocephalus, and typhus fever, often acquires an unnatural degree of softness, and sometimes it is converted into a substance like custard. This fact has been long known, and the softening is either general or partial. From what I have observed, it is more

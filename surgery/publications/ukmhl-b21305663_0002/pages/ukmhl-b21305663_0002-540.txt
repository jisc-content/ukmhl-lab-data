49^ ELEMENTS Oi-' ANATOMY. must be possessed of exactly the same properties and structure, or the one could not supply the place of the other. Such an opinion was also, on consideration, greatly supported by the well known similarity of arrangement, and intimacy of con- nection, Avhich these nerves have, in their natural distribu- tion.‚Äù Of the Eighth Pair of Nerves. The eighth pair of nerves is connected, by several small nerves, with the basis of the corpora olivaria. It consists of two parts ; of the par vagum, or pneumo-gastric nerve, and of the glosso-pharyngeus; which latter has been already described. The par vagum, or pneumo-gastric nerve, is composed of several small fasciculi, which are collected into a single trunk, which passes through the foramen lacerum in basi cranii, be- fore the lateral sinus; from which latter it is separated by a process of the dura mater. After the par vagum has passed through the skull, it is somewhat enlarged, forming a sort of ganglion. The par vagum descends, in the neck, in the same cellular sheath with the internal jugular vein, and common carotid artery. In the horse, this nerve is of great size, and larger, in pro- portion to the sympathetic nerve, than in man. The branches of the par vagum are, lstf, the Pharyngeal Branch, which receives branches from the accessory nerve, and from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The pharyngeal branch sends off several small nerves, which unite with others, from the great sympathetic nerve, which pass along the common carotid artery. The other branches of the pharyngeal nerve are distributed upon the middle and back part of the constrictors of the pharynx; and these unite with some small filaments of the glosso-pharyngeus, and also with the superior laryngeal nerve, and with the accessory nerve, and sympathetic. My colleague Dr Home had a patient afflicted by the usual symptoms of stricture at the cardia, and in addition to these, whenever she turned to the left side, she suffered very

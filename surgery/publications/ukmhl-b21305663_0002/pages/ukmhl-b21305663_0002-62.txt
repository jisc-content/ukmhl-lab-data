36 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. '1 he valve between the anterior auricle and ventricle, con- sists of three principal parts, and is somewhat of a triangular form ; with its basis fixed to the columns carneae of the ven- tricle : hence it has been called Tricuspid Valve. This valve lies close upon the side of the ventricle; and, consequently, allows the stream of blood to flow into that ca- vity from the auricle. When the ventricle contracts itself, the columnae carneae are at the same instant contracted, and pull the loose edge of the membrane from the sides of the pa- rietes, the blood insinuating itself under the valve; the pro- jecting points of the membrane meet, and thus the communi- cation between the auricle and ventricle is cut off*. If the extremities of that valve had not been connected with the columnae carneae of the ventricle, the valve must have been turned inside out, and thrown back into the ventricle; and hence the blood must have been refluent, and w'ould have passed into the auricle, instead of flowing into the pul- monary artery. The ventricles constitute the most essential part of the heart; they may be compared to a forcing machine, and therefore merit the most particular mention ; the other cavi- ties, called Auricles, being merely reservoirs, in which the blood is collected, during the contraction of the ventricle. Of the Anterior or Pulmonary Ventricle. The anterior ventricle is somewhat triangular in form, with the smaller extremity directed downwards, and convex in front and flat behind. Winslow, Senac, and Haller, entertained different opinions respecting the comparative size of the ventricles; as far as I can judge, the anterior ventricle has been represented as being larger in respect to the poste- rior ventricle than it is in nature ; and this error as to the ca- pacity of the ventricles, has originated in the greater thinness of the parietes of the anterior ventricle, which yield more readily to water, or any other fluid thrown into it, than the thicker parietes of the posterior ventricle. The greater part of the inner surface of the heart is very ir- regular, owing to the columns) Carneae and foveas between

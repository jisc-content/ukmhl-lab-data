OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. 241 swelling above and below, from the sterno-cleido-mastoid and onio-hyoid muscles, as also from the jugular veins and carotid arteries, which were intimately connected vith the tumour by cellular membranes, until I freed them, as far as the point where the thyroid arteries come off. I then tied both the su- perior and inferior thyroideal arteries of either side, close to the tumour, and, on account of the free anastomoses, used the double ligature, dividing the vessels in the space between. The deeper I carried my dissection now, the more serious did the operation appear, since at every cut of four or five lines, I was obliged to tie two or three arteries; and these liga- tures, on account of the size of the tumour, and the deep si- tuation of the vessels, were very difficult, and required great care. “ When I had, with the greatest caution, dissected to the base of the tumour, which was firmly fixed to the thyroid carti- lage and the three upper rings of the trachea, on every side so great a number of arteries presented themselves, for the most part of the diameter of the radial or digital arteries, that I could not cut a line or two without dividing two or three of them. Under these circumstances, and as the patient, not- withstanding the speedy ligature of the arteries, (effected partly by means of the artery forceps, partly by the needle and thread,) had already lost a very considerable quantity of blood, I hesitated not, that I might bring the operation to a more speedy close, and spare as much as possible the loss of blood, to adopt at once the method since recommended by Brun- xinghausen,—namely, to tie the base of the swelling, and then, with the bistoury, to extirpate the tumour above it. I used for this purpose a blunt-pointed aneurismal needle, arm- ed with two four-threaded ligatures ; and while I directed the tumour to be pulled upward, passed the needle through the middle of its base, and, drawing the ligatures through, I tied one below, the other above, as firmly as possible. However, that I might perfectly command the bleeding, I passed also a third ligature around the whole circumference of the swelling, and extirpated the tumour now without any bleeding from the von. ii. a

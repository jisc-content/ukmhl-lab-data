OF THE MUSCLES OF THE THORAX WHICH ARE SUBSERVIENT TO RESPIRATION. The muscles by which respiration is performed, constitute a part of the parietes of the thorax. The lungs during res- piration are passive, and follow the movements of the chest: they have not unaptly been compared to a pair of bellows con- taining an empty bladder, the neck of which is so adapted to the boards of the bellows, as to admit the air, on the boards being separated from each other. The muscles by which respiration is performed belong to that class of muscles which have been called mixed; as we can retard, accelerate, or stop, for a short time only, the ac- tion of these muscles. To expose the muscles covering the fore-part of the thorax, an ineision should be made through the skin, in the direction of the breast-bone, and extended obliquely outwards, along each of the clavicles. Upon raising up the skin, cellular sub- stance, fat and mammae; the greater pectoral muscles, covered by a thin tendinous aponeurosis, and at their upper part by the thin muscle called Platysma Myoides, come into view. The fibres of the pectoral muscle, which arise from the cartilages of the fifth and sixth ribs and clavicle, converge, and form a stronge tendon, which is fixed into the os humeri. On the fore part of the pectoral muscle, there are several small branches of the internal mammary arteries, which come through the interstices between the ribs.

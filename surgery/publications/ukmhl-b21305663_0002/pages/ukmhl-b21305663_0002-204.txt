ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 166 ii stone imbedded behind the prostate gland. For sounding the bladdei, a catheter, made of steel, as recommended by my Father, is a good instrument; for when the bladder is empty, the stone may then be discovered. lo me it seems probable, that the exact form and size of the urethra cannot be ascertained, considering the materials of which it is composed ; for that part of the urethra which passes through the triangular ligament docs not change its place, whereas the other portions are connected with the flexi- ble elastic corpora cavernosa penis; besidf, the membrane of the urethra is very elastic, and also the corpus spongiosum urethrae, which incloses it, and is, at the same time, compres- sible. The above circumstances are sufficient to show the diffi- culty, nay impossibility, of arriving at a knowledge of the pre- cise course or capacity of different parts of the urethra; be- side, the course of the urethra is different in the distended and in the collapsed state of the penis. The course of the urethra pubis is altered by different po- sitions of the body; and hence the very great superiority of a flexible silver or gum catheter, which adapts itself to the curvatures of the urethra, in whatever situation the bodv is The urethra takes its rise from the bladder, near to the lov'est part of that organ; and, after emerging from the pro- state gland, passes through a circular aperture in the triangu- lar ligament of the bladder, and then descends and passes for- wards, for about half an inch. This ligament fills the upper part of the space, which in- tervenes between the rami of the ossa pubis, and its broader edge, which forms a portion of a large circle, with its concavity downwards, or towards the anus: it may readily be felt, like a stretched cord, immediately under the bulb of the urethra. The triangular ligament is covered by a plexus of small veins, by the bulb of the urethra, by CowrEitâ€™s glands, by the acceleratores urina?, and by skin. This ligament, in some bodies, has somewhat of a fleshy appearance.

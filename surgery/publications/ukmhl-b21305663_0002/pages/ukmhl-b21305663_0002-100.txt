70 ELEMENTS OF ANATOM V. CHAP. II. OF THE OllGANS OF .RESPIRATION. Having, in a preceding Chapter, treated of the circula- tion of the blood, it is now necessary to direct the attention of the reader to the changes which the blood undergoes during the circulation; and of these the most striking is the change which the blood undergoes in the organs of respiration. The functions of circulation and respiration have an immediate re- lation and dependence upon each other ; hence the structure of the organs of respiration is varied according to the nature of the apparatus by which the blood is circulated. Inspira- tion cannot take place without circulation, and by it the blood is exposed to the influence of the atmospherical air. The venous blood, though charged with the chyle, is inade- cpiate to support the functions of the animal economy, unless it be exposed to the air; and hence, in all animals, the respira- tory apparatus consists chiefly of a congeries of bloodvessels, to which the air has free access. In the classes Mammalia and Birds, there are two circulations, a particular one through the lungs, and a general one through the body at large, for which purpose there are two hearts, viz. a pulmonic, and a systematic heart; by the former, the blood is sent into the lungs, where it is exposed to the influence of the atmospherical air, and is returned to the latter, com- pletely changed in its properties, before being diffused over the body, by the branches of the aorta. The lungs are spongy bodies, consisting of air-vessels, air- cells, bloodvessels, absorbents, and nerves, which are all in- volved in cellular substance and membranes.

ELEMENTS OF AN ATOM V. 518 is subdivided into superficial and deep seated branches; the former of which is distributed upon the muscles of the little finger, and the opposite sides of the little finger. The deeper seated branches of the ulnar nerve in the palm of the hand, pass between the abductor and flexor parvus minimi digiti, and then form an arch, which accompanies the branches of the radial artery ; and from this deep seated arch there arc branches derived, which supply the abductor mini- mi digiti, the flexor brevis, abductor pollicis, lumbricales, and interossei muscles. From the branches of the nerves which supply the fingers, there are many lateral branches, which are distributed upon the muscles of the fingers, and which at last terminate upon the points of the fingers, by a number of small fibrils. There are many anastomoses between the smaller branches of the radial and ulnar nerves, which also holds true in re- spect to the nerves on the palmar and dorsal sides of the fin- gers. It may not be improper to add, that, under the axilla, the ulnar and spiral nerves are united by small branches, from which union a small branch is sent, which passes under the skin which covers the triceps muscle *. 8th, The spiral nerve, the largest nerve derived from the axillary plexus, is placed between the ulnar nerve and axillary artery : it passes downwards obliquely between two of the heads of the triceps, and afterwards to the outer side of the arm; and it is accompanied, in that course, by the spi- ral artery. In its course along the posterior part of the os humeri, there are several branches detached from it to the triceps muscle, and one accompanies the spinal artery, and is spent upon the extensor muscles of the fore-arm. There is also a subcutaneous branch sent off behind the os humeri, which passes down to the back-part of the fore-arm, and back-part of the hand, and joins with the branches of the ulnar nerve. * Vide Cami-er's Views of the Nerves of the Arm.

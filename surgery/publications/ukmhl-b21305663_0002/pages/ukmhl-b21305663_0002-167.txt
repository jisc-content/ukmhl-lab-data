129 OF THE KIDNEYS. buttxl somewhat like to stars, from which many branches pass to the capsules of the kidneys, and others are reflected in- wards, and form what have been called the acini of the kid- neys. When a penetrating injection has been thrown into the re- nal artery, it often passes into the uriniferous tubes, or imi- tates the secretion of urine. The veins of the kidneys are larger than those of the cor- responding arteries; they communicate freely within the cor- tical substance, and also upon the surfaces of the kidney. These superficial communications, in the seal, are of great size; they ultimately form a large trunk, which opens into the vena cava inferior, and the left vein, the longer, necessarily passes across the aorta. The nerves of the kidneys are derived from the semi-lu- nar solar plexus: they form an intimate web, which surrounds the bloodvessels, and enter the kidneys with these. The absorbents of the kidneys are numerous, and termi- nate in the lumbar glands. t , Of the Renal Glands. The Renal Glands are of a yellow colour, somewhat of a triangular form, about two inches long, surrounded by cel- lular substance, and adhere to the upper and fore parts of the kidneys. These glands are sometimes filled with a bilious looking fluid. The renal glands of the foetus are proportionally larger than in the adult, and are nearly as large as the kidneys. Of the Ureters. The Ureters are musculo-membranaceous tubes, by which the urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder of urine. The ureters are situated behind the peritonaeum. The ureters arise from the inner and lower part of the pel- vis of the kidney. These tubes are not cylindrical but contracted, where they VOL. II. r

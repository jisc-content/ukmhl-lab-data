184 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. vasadeferentia and vesiculae seminales, there are several small orifices : these are the ducts of the prostate gland. Of the Vesiculec Seminales. The vesiculae seminales, which arc included in distinct sacs, are equal in length to the breadth of 3 or 4 fingers, and near- ly three times as long as broad: but their length, and also their breadth, materially differ in different individuals; and sometimes the vesicula of one side is larger than that of the other. Castration has an obvious effect upon the size of the vesi- culae ; by mutilation, they shrink considerably in size. Even in the same animal, they differ in size at different seasons, as in birds; they shrink in these animals, during the winter months, to a small size, but expand to a considerable bulk in spring. The vesiculae are of an oblong form, and are placed ob- liquely in respect to each other, between the most dependent part of the bladder of urine and rectum, to both of which they are connected by loose cellular substance. By their anterior and narrow extremities they are united to the pros- tate gland, and their broader rounded extremities diverge up- wards and outwards from each other, and terminate in a nar- row extremity, very nearly opposite to the entrance of the ureters into the bladder of urine. When the fat and cellular substance which envelopes the ve- siculae seminales has been carefully removed, the surface oi the vesiculae are found to be irregular, somewhat like to that of the brain ; and, between the convolutions, the bloodvessels proper to the vesiculae are placed. The outer membrane proper to the vesiculae is ot a pale brown colour ; has a shining surface ; and the irregularities of the surface catch the light, which gives diem a brilliant appearance. The internal coat of the vesiculae seminales is a mucous membrane, from the surface of which a mucous fluid is secreted. There is no appearance of muscular fibres upon the vesicu-

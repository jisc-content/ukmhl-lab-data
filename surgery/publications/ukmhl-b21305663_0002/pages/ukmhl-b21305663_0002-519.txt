ON THE COLOUR OF THE HUMAN SKIN. 478 landers, the Western Asiatics, and inhabitants of Northern Africa. But the above observation must be received, with a certain limitation ; for Forster *, and Dami>ier -f-, tell us, that a blush is perceptible on the cheek of the fairest Otaheite and Tunganese women. The Albino forms a very singular variety of people, with a dead white or reddish skin; and these people have been ob- served in almost all parts of the world. The skin of the Al- bino is remarkably rough, which has given rise to the notion that the white colour proceeds from disease ; but I have seen several of these people, who, though not robust, seemed to be in perfect health. There are almost endless varieties as to the shade of co- lour. According to Jefferson j, Winterbottom §, and Waffer II, there are whites among the blacks of Africa : this peculiarity exists from birth, and it is propagated from father to son. Dr Winterbottom informs us, that the parents, brothers and sisters of a white African woman were black; she was married to a black man, and had a black child. The second class includes those people whose skin is of a yellow or olive colour, as the natives of Asia. The third class includes the natives of the American Con- tinent, who have a reddish or copper-coloured complexion, of which there is a great variety of shades. The fourth class comprehends the inhabitants of the majo- rity of the Islands of the Pacific Ocean, who are of a brown or tawny complexion. The fifth and last class comprehends the natives of Africa, excepting those of its northern and southern extremities, the natives of New Holland, Van Dieman’s Land, New Guinea, and the New Hebrides. • Notes on Virginia. -j- History of Sierra Leone.

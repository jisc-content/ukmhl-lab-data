VEINS OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 307 The deeper-seated set of veins, or venae comites satellites, accompany the arteries. The tibial, fibular, and sural veins, terminate in the popli- teal vein, which lies over the popliteal artery. The femoral vein receives all the veins which correspond with the branches of the femoral artery and those of the ar- teria profunda. The veins, from the inguinal glands and external organs of generation, are also joined to the deep femoral vein, which passes under the crural arch: it is then named anterior iliac vein. In the more common kind of crural hernia, the tumour is situated on the pubal side of the vein : the neck of the tu- mour is covered by the upper insertion of the falciform pro- cess, and the epigastric artery lies on the ilial side of the her- nia *. The anterior iliac vein receives the circumflex, epigastric, and sometimes the obturator veins, and the large plexus of veins which covers the prostate gland ; and from which, it is probable, a good deal of blood is derived, when that plexus is divided in the operation of lithotomy, especially when they become varicose. A varicose state of those veins which lie over the neck of the bladder has, by projecting into the bladder, sometimes proved the cause of retention of urine, according to Mr De- sault. The veins of the prostate gland, according to Sir E. Home, have sometimes been ruptured by riding on horseback. The hypogastric vein, formed by the conjoined veins which correspond with the branches of the hypogastric artery, is united with the iliac vein. The anterior and posterior iliac veins form the common iliac; and by the union of the com- mon iliac veins, the Vena Cava Inferior is formed, which, at its origin, receives the sacral and lumbar veins. \arix is more common in the subcutaneous than in the * Vide an account of the varieties of Crural Hernia, in my book on the Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach, and Intestines.

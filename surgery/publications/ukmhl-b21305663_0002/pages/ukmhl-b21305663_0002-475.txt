429 OF THE EYE-LIDS. The eyelids are not so thick and opake as entirely to ex- clude light, but very effectually defend the eye against too vi- vid light. They also defend the eye from the particles of dust floating in the air, and from external injury; and, by their movements, probably occasion an increased secretion of tears. These have also an effect in determining the flow of tears towards the puncta lacrvmalia. Of the Ciliary Glands. The ciliary glands, which are composed of a number of fol- licles, are placed between the tarsus and lining of the eyelids, in grooves, in the posterior parts of the tarsal cartilages. These glands are of a brown yellow colour, are disposed in rows, and in a transverse direction, to the length of the carti- lage; and, when viewed through a magnifying glass, they ap- pear like a cluster of pearls. From these glands a sebaceous matter is derived, which ex- udes through the small orifices of these glands, called the Punda ciliaria, which are placed upon the edges of the eye- lids : this prevents the eyelids from adhering to each other, and serves also as a kind of ointment for the eyes. These glands are more numerous in the upper than in the under eyelids. Of the Cilia or Eye-lashes. The cilia or eye-lashes, which are not always of the same colour as the hairs of the head, are implanted on the edges of the eye-lids, in double or triple rows. Those of the upper eye-lid, which are longer than those of the under eye-lid, are bent upwards, and those of the under eye-lid are turned down- wards. In both eye-lids they are wanting towards the inner angle. These hairs prevent dust, or other extraneous bodies, from getting into the eye-ball; and also act as a sort of shade to the eye, and they are highly ornamental; and, owing to their par- ticular direction, they do not impede our vision.

293 OF THE EPIGASTRIC ARTERY. ral arch; it is then reflected upwards and inwards behind the spermatic cord, and on the inner side of the upper abdomi- nal aperture. The artery then passes behind the rectus abdominis muscle, and ascends to meet with the smaller branches of the internal mammary artery, upon the back-part of the rectus abdominis. In the female, a branch of this artery passes along the round ligament of the womb, and there are branches of it which go to the mons veneris and labia pudendi. The epigastric artery sends a small branch, which is dis- tributed upon the pubal side of Gimbernat’s ligament; a se- cond, which passes through the inguinal canal; a third to the spermatic cord, which communicates with the spermatic ar- tery, behind the peritonaeum. In the common inguinal hernia, the epigastric artery is placed nearer to the symphysis pubis than the protruded bowels, and, by the displaced bowels, is pressed still nearer to it: but when the bowels do not follow the whole course of the inguinal canal, but pass through the under abdominal aperture only, as in the ventro-inguinal hernia, the epigastric artery is between the spine of the ilium and the protruded bowels : hence, if the incision for the removal of the stricture be made on the pubal side of the hernia, the epigastric artery will be divided, if the hernia be the common inguinal; and if, on the other hand, the incision for taking off the stricture be made on the ileal side of the tumour, the epigastric artery will probably be divided, if it be a ventro-inguinal hernia. As during life there is a difficulty in distinguishing the com- mon from the more rare ventro-inguinal hernia; hence, the greater safety of making the incision for taking off* the stric- ture in the middle of the neck of the hernial tumour. Many small branches of this artery are distributed upon the integuments of the abdomen, which sink into the sub- stance of the recti and other muscles of the abdomen; and anastomose with the thoracic, intercostal, and lumbar arteries. Circumflex Artery of the Ilium.—This artery arises op- posite to the epigastric artery ; runs along the internal edge of the crural arch, under the peritonaeum : follows a retro-

462 ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY SECTION IV. OF THE TONGUE AND SENSE OF TASTE. The sense of Taste is very much allied to that of Touch, of which it may be said to be a more exquisite modification. The tongue, the organ in which the sense of taste chiefly resides, is placed as a guardian, which, together with the nose, enables animals to distinguish between that kind of food which is noxious, and that which is wholesome. The tongue also assists us in the articulation of words, and in deglutition. The tongue varies in its size in different animals; and in some it is not merely an organ of taste but also of appre- hension. That the tongue may be rendered a more delicate organ of taste, its surface is elevated into a number of papillae, and it is very flexible; thus the sense is rendered more acute, a greater surface being presented to the sapid body. Those substances which are dry do not communicate any peculiar taste, unless dissolved in the saliva: therefore, even the more sapid bodies do not communicate any impres- sion, when there is a want of spittle, and when the tongue is dry, or when, in consequence of disease, the saliva is secreted in too small quantity, or in a vitiated state ; and it may be added, that perhaps different substances communicate a more obtuse or a more lively impression upon the tongue, in propor- tion to their solubility in the saliva. This sense is not equally acute in all men : this may de- pend upon original conformation, upon habit, and a variety of other causes. There are four different sets of papillae on the surface of the tongue, which are better seen in the living than in the dead body, even after the vessels of the tongue have been suc- cessfully filled by a coloured injection. Dr Grew thought he had seen the papillae stretched, when a sapid body was applied to them ; but though no doubt can

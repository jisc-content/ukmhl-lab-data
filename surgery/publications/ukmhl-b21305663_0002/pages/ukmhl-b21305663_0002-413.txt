OF HYD&ENCEPHALtrS. 367 Â« The lower ventricles of the brain have been supposed to communicate in a sound body with the cavity of the medulla spinalis ; and some authors, particularly IIuysch, have found a dropsy of the ventricles accompany one of the spinal mar- row ; and that on letting the water out from the spinal mar- row, the bead was drained. The proof at first sight ap- pears decisive and incontestible ; ypt I think I find just grounds to deny any natural communication between these ca- vities; for, in the first place, the tunica arachnoidea and pia ma- ter, appear* to me to shut the fourth ventricle at its lower part, and on pouring in water, or a small quantity of quicksilver, they prevent it from descending into the spine. In the next place, none of the cases of dropsy of the,head which I have yet dissected, one excepted, were accompanied with dropsy of the spine ; and in that one exception, where water was lodged at the bottom of the spine to the quantity of six ounces, and a still greater quantity of it in the ventricles of the brain, not a drop of the water of the ventricles ran out on opening the spine, though the head was held erect on purpose to try the experiment. So that I am persuaded, that, in the case men- tioned by IIuysch, if the water was not collected between the pia and dura mater, the membranes at the bottom of the fourth ventricle over the spinal marrow, where they want the support of the cranium, had burst; just as we find, in the as- cites, the peritonaeum and cellular membranes at the umbili- cus, are sometimes rent by the weight of the water. In that case, where the water was collected at the bottom of the spine, forming a disease which was first described by Tulpius, un- der the name of Spina bifida, I found, with Mr Hutchison of Dalkeith, the spinal marrow closely adhering to the back- the brain again and again, and the patients, with the exception of the case of which Dr Vose has published an account, have died. The father of a patient whom I had attended for a considerable time, was in- duced to consent to the puncture of the brain of his child, though Dr Hamil- toh, and several other physicians, were, like myself, hostile to it. The child died in sixteen hours after the operation. I was requested to examine the state of the brain, and found, that not above a half of the water which had been: contained within the enlarged lateral ventricles had been discharged. 2

520 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. and brachialis interims muscles, to both of which it gives many small branches, gets to the outer side of the tendon of the scapulo-radialis muscle, and passes behind the median ce- phalic vein. This nerve passes down the arm, under the skin, and over the supinator radii longus, as far as the root of the thumb, where it anastomoses with the superficial branch of the musculo-spiral, and gives also branches to the back of the hand. This nerve has sometimes been injured in opening the ce- phalic vein, at the elbow. 10th, The nervus cutaneus, so named, from its situation under the skin, passes down along the inner and fore part of the arm. In its course downwards it supplies the coraco-bra- chialis muscle; and, at the elbow-joint, or a little higher, is divided into three or four branches, which have been named, from their situation on the outer and inner sides of the arm, external and internal. The external passes behind, and its other branches pass before the median basilic vein, and afterwards suddenly di- vides into a number of very small nerves, which are spent up- on the elbow-joint and fore-arm. This nerve may be wounded in performing venesection, even by the most skilful anatomist. The internal branch, which is rather smaller than the pre- ceding, crosses over the basilic vein to the inner side of the elbow, and terminates on the inner side of the fore-arm. lltf/t, The CUTANEUS INTERNUS OF WRISBERG. Tile CU- taneus internus of Wrisberg also takes its rise from the axil- lary plexus. This nerve, which is smaller than the former, divides into two branches: the larger descends along the back-part of the triceps, and disappears at the under part of that muscle. The former winds round to the back-part of the arm, and is spent upon the triceps. The nerves, called the intercosto-humerales, derived from the second and third intercostal nerves, are distributed upon the fore and lateral parts of the thorax, and upon the

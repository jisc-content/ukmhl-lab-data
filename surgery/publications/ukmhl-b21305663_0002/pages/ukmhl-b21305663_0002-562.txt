ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 516* T.he interosseous nerve, in its course to the wrist, supplies the flexor muscles of the thumb and fingers, and terminates on the pronator x*adii quadratus. The trunk of the radial nerve, near to the wrist, is placed near to the skin : it passes under the annular ligament of the wrist to the palm of the hand, where it is covered by a thin tendinous aponeurosis; and, in that situation, divides into seven branches; two of which lead to the thumb, and one to the side of the fore-finger next the thumb. The other branches are derived from two trunks, and supply the opposite side of the fore-finger, both sides of the middle finger, and the side of the ring-finger, next the middle finger. There are several smaller nerves also sent from the radial nerve, which are distributed upon the lumbricales muscles; and there are others which accompany the branches which form the superficial palmer arch. The nerves of the opposite sides of the fingers are uuited at their points, and at. length terminate by a great many small nerves. It has been long known that a ligature applied around a nerve,â€¢occasions the death of the animal. Larry has made mention of two persons who died from tetanus, from the effect of a ligature upon a nerve. The arm of one of the patients had been amputated, and the radial nerve was included in the ligature along with the humeral artery. The nerve, we are informed, below the ligature, swelled like a mushroom, and that above was much enlarged of a reddish hue. In the other case, in which the leg had been amputated, the extremities of the nerves were much swollen. Portal has also made mention of the swelling of the sci- atic nerve, from the effects of a ligature. Larry obviated the effect of the ligature upon the nerve, by passing a grooved stylet between the artery and the liga- ture, and by passing the blade of a very fine pair of scissars in the groove, and cutting the thread.

I then (says Sir Astley) passed the forceps into the bladder, and was so fortunate in my first operation as to extract eight calculi. “ The instrument gave but little pain on its introduction ; but when opened to its greatest extent, and the stones admit- ted between its blades,* their removal was painful, more espe- cially at the glans penis, which appears to be the portion of the urethra which furnishes the greatest resistance to the re- moval of the stones. “ A dose of opium was given after each operation, which was repeated seven times before the calculi were all remo- ved.” Sir Astley adds, “ Farther experience is required to de- termine if it be best to dilate the meatus in a few minutes or hours, or in several days by more gradual dilatation In a late case, treated by Mr Hamilton, though the fe- male urethra was so much dilated as to admit to pass through it a stone of an ounce weight, which had been lodged within the bladder, yet no degree of incontinence of urine followed. —It may be added, that the operation occupied no less than eighteen hours, and was attended by very acute pain.

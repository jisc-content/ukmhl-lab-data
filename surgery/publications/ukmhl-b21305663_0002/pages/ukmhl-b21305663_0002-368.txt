ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 322 in which, hy the naked eye, the fasciculi that compose them are obvious: in the goose the fasciculi are larger than in the horse. A number of small bloodvessels are proper to the coats of the nerves. In the nerves, there is a white as well as a grey coloured substance, derived from the pia mater. The proper nervous substance is more abundant in some nerves than in others, especially in the optic and auditory nerves. When the matter of the nerve is examined, it looks semipellucid, and with a white and opake looking fibre pass- ing through it in transverse and serpentine lines : these are most distinct, when the nerve is in a state of relaxation, and they disappear to a certain degree, when a nerve is put upon the stretch, which led my Father to suppose them intended to accommodate the nerves to the different states of flexure and extension. The nerves are supplied with arteries from the neighbour- ing bloodvessels, and they have also corresponding veins; and where inflammation has attacked the nerve, it assumes a red colour, from the number of bloodvessels dispersed on it. The nerves do not readily putrefy after death, nor are they affected during life by gangrene. When the nervous matter is subjected to chemical analysis, it is found to be similar to that of the brain. Of the Structure of the Nerves. All parts of the body probably are supplied with nerves, but not to the same extent. The organs of the senses, of ge- neration, and of voluntary motion, are largely supplied with nerves. The different degrees of perception have been stated to bear a proportion to the number of nerves proper to a part;â€”a position which cannot be admitted, as the nerves of the heart, a very sensible organ, are very small. Few nerves can be traced into the glands; yet these are very sensible organs, and the nature ol the fluid secreted by them is much affected by passions of the miud, and other causes which affect the nervous system.

24 ELEMENTS Ol-' ANATOMY. 1000 grains oi serum oi blood contain, according to Dr Marcet *, Water, - . 900 Albumen (dry), - - 86.8 Muco-extractive matter, - - 4.0 Muriate of soda, with some muriate of potash, - 6.6 Subcarbonate of soda, - - 1.65 Sulphate of potash, - . 0.35 Phosphates of lime, iron, and magnesia, - 0.60 1000.00 According to some very late experiments of Prevost and Dumas, the blood is essentially composed of serum, holding in suspension the red globules, which are contained in their proper vesicles. When blood has been drawn, the central globules are attracted together, and arrange themselves in lines or fibres, by which the basis of the clot is formed. A quantity of the serum, and of the colouring matter, are en- tangled in the net-work formed by these fibres, which, by draining, may be separated from them. They have observed, that the colouring matter is a com- pound of a peculiar animal substance, (the nature of which they have not particularly examined), and of the peroxide of iron. It may be proper to add, that Berzelius considers the fibrin and red globules as distinct proximate principles. Of the Cruor. The cruor, or clot, is of a red colour, and its mean specific gravity is about 1.245 according to Jurin. The cruor, by being well washed, is in part dissolved, and a part remains upon the searce. Thus it may be separated into two parts; into a white, elastic, and solid substance, pos- sessing the properties of Jibrin; and the portion held in solu- tion, which contains the colouring principle.

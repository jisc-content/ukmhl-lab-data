165 OF THE URETHRA. The small veins of the extremity of the rectum follow a tortuous course, and unite with the vein that accompanies the pudendal artery; and some of them pass into the veins which accompany the sacral lateral arteries, which veins join with the venous sinuses of the lumbar vertebrae. The penis is largely supplied with nerves, the larger trunks of which are situated upon the upper surface of that organ, and are accompanied by many lymphatic vessels, which run into the uppermost cluster of inguinal glands. SECTION VI. OF THE URETHRA. The urethra, the canal common to the urine and semen, extends from the bladder to the extremity of the penis, being, at an average, about nine inches long in the adult, but some- times it scarcely exceeds eight inches, and, at other times, it is very near ten inches in length. In the strictest acceptation of the words, the urethra is not a canal, for, excepting whilst the urine and semen are passing through it, its opposite sides are in contact with each other. In some instances the urethra does not pass through the glans penis, but opens behind it, or in the perinaeum. The urethra describes a tortuous course. Much pains have been taken by anatomists and surgeons to ascertain the precise course and diameter of different parts of the urethra, by filling it with melted wax, or by passing through it wax or leaden probes, and adapting these to its curvatures ; but the object in view has not been obtained; of which the very different forms given to the bougie, by diffe- rent surgeons, and to metallic sounds, are sufficient evidence. For examining the bladder of a patient, supposed to be af- flicted with stone, sounds of different lengths and shapes are required : they must be varied according to the position of the stone; some must be much bent, to reach the higher parts of the bladder; others should be more nearly straight, to touch

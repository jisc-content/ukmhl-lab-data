416 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. justment of the eye, it is impossible for me to doubt of its be- *> ing done in this way, in the absence of all other means for that purpose. “ It is no small corroboration of this being the use of the muscle, that there is a similar muscle employed to tune the ear, by tightening the drum. “ It is now ascertained that, when the crystalline lens is re- moved, there is no longer a power of adjusting the eye; but so great is the compensation produced, by diminishing the size of the aperture, that both Mr Ramsden and myself were deceived, and believed that such power still existed, till experiments with Dr Young’s Optometer exposed the error. “ An experiment made with the Belladonna, upon the eye of a gentleman sixty-nine years of age, who had been myopic from his earliest infancy, proved, that although the influence of the belladonna increases the size of the pupil beyond that of the other eye, the adjustment remains the same,— the muscle of the lens in myopic eyes of long standing losing in degree the power of contraction, probably from want of size'fx" An opacity at the pupil was formerly called by authors a Cataract. Membranes growing upon the iris sometimes cover a part or the whole of the pupil. These are commonly white and opaque, resembling the membranes or specks which we often observe covering part of the cornea. In two cases, my Father observed filaments passing along the pupil, of the same colour as the iris, in which they were rooted. These were not perceived by the patient, just as threads glued to the surface of a convex lens or magnifying glass do not appear in the focus of the rays which it collects, or in the. pictures which it forms of objects. By the term Cataract is now-a-days understood an opacity of the capsule, or substance of the crystalline lens. The former may be called the J\Tembranous, and the latter the Crystalline, cataract. • Vide Sir E. Home’s Lect. on Compar. Anat. vol. iii- p- 2JS.

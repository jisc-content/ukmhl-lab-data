391 OF THE EYE. in general, it may be observed, that the more complex the structure of the nose, the more acute the sense of smell is. The sinuses which communicate with the nose, tend to ren- der the voice louder and more melodious. Of the Ductus Indsivus, or Passage from the Nose into the Mouth. This duct opens behind the incisor teeth of the upper jaw, into the mouth; and hence has been called ductus indsivus *. The groove for this duct is of different sizes in different skulls-; sometimes it is large and very manifest, but on other occa- sions superficial; and my Father observes, that “ in by far the greater number of human subjects, of different ages, I have not been able to find any vestige of such ducts, in the bottom of the nose, or roof of the mouth : But, in a few sub- jects, I have found them open at both ends, but always very much smaller than in the quadruped. In some of these I passed a bristle, or small probe, very readily from the enose into the mouth.” SECTION II. OF THE EYE. The Eye-ball is composed of coats, which contain transpa- rent humours of different densities, calculated for collecting the rays of light into a focus upon the nerve situated at die bottom of the eye-ball. The eye-balls are situated within the orbits, as also the muscles which move them in different directions, and the bloodvessels, nerves and absorbents proper to the eye-ball and its muscles. The eye-ball projects beyond the orbits, especially on the outer side, and much more in some animals than in man, as in birds, owing to the orbits being formed like a cone, the Vide Plate Vf. fig. i., appended to my Father’s Treatise on the Eye.

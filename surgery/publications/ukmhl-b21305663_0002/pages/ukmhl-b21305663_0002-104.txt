74 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Of the Thyroid Cartilage. The largest cartilage has been called thyroid, from its sup- posed resemblance to a shield. It occupies the fore and la- teral parts of the larynx, and consists of two wings, which are united before, and form that prominence in the fore part of the neck so remarkable in the male, called thepomum Adami, in the upper part of which there is a notch. The wings of the thyroid cartilage, when spread out, are somewhat of a square form, and are externally concave, and their concavities lodge the thyro-hyoid muscles. The superior surface of the thyroid cartilage is connected by a distinct membrane to the os hyoides ; and, from its pos- terior cornua, there are two ascending portions, which are united to the os hyoides, by round ligaments. The inferior surface of this cartilage is shorter than the su- perior, curved backwards, and united with the articulating surface of the cricoid cartilage. Of the Cricoid Cartilage. The cricoid cartilage forms the base on which the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages are fixed, by means of articular sur- faces. This cartilage is circular, and narrower before than behind, where it rises up between the wings of the thyroid cartilage; and on this posterior part of the cartilage there are smooth surfaces, by which the arytenoid cartilages are ar- ticulated with the cricoid cartilage. The posterior surface is divided by a ridge into two lateral cavities, for the crico-arytenoidei postici muscles. The inferior part of the cricoid cartilage is placed horizon- tally, and is connected with the upper part of the windpipe. The superior part of this cartilage is connected to the thy- roid, by a distinct membrane. The back-part of this carti- lage rises up between the wings of the thyroid cartilage, and the inferior portions are connected by small oblique ligaments to the thyroid cartilage. The opening transversely the crico-thyroid membrane is called Laryngotomy, an operation which is rendered neces-

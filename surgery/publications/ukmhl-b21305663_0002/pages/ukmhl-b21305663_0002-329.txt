OF THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. 285 pass under the vena cava ; but, on some occasions, the lum- bar arteries on both sides come off from the aorta by a single trunk. The lumbar arteries of the same side communicate. Anatomists differ as to the number of the lumbar arteries. Haller enumerated six pairs, but most authors have reckoned five pairs only. All the lumbar arteries are situate behind the psoas and quadrate lumborum muscles. The lumbar arteries give branches to the spine, spinal marrow, muscles of the loins, the transverse and oblique muscles of the abdomen; and they communicate with the internal mammary, lower inter- costal, diaphragmatic, epigastric, and circumflexa ossis ilii ar- teries. SECTION IV. OF THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES, AND THEIR BRANCHES. The aorta, opposite to the third lumbar vertebra, (but ac- cording to Haller, opposite to the fourth lumbar vertebra), divides into two branches, which are, in the adult, very near- ly of an equal size, and which have been termed Common Iliac Arteries. The common iliac arteries follow a similar course on the opposite sides of the pelvis. An artery, about the size of a surgeonâ€™s probe, arises from the bifurcation of the aorta, or from the iliac, which runs along the fore-part of the sacrum, as far as the lower extremity of the ossa coccygis. It has been called, from its situation, the Sacra Media. Du- ring its progress, it joins repeatedly with the sacrae laterales arteries, with which it forms anastomoses; and from these small branches are sent to the rectum and bladder of urine, and to the iliacus internus muscle. The right iliac artery crosses over the lower part of the ve- na cava, and inclines to the outer side of the concomitant vein. As there is a certain degree of resistance to the flow of the blood from the aorta to the common iliac arteries, this part of the arterial system is sometimes thrown into a diseased state. The common iliac arteries sweep along the upper aperture

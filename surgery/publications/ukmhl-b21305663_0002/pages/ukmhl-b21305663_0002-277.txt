OF THE ARTERIES AND VEINS 233 CHAPTER V. OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARTERIES AND VEINS. HaVING, in a former Chapter, described the structure of the coats of the arteries and veins, and all those general circumstances regarding these, which are most worthy of at- tention, I shall now proceed to describe their particular dis- tribution. In conducting the reader through this department of ana- tomy, I shall describe those larger branches which are im- portant, in a practical point of view, from their being exposed to disease, and to be cut or torn; or from their forming col- lateral anastomoses, by which the life of a part is preserved, when the main trunk has been obstructed. But, were I to proceed further, and attempt to describe the more minute branches, I might be accused of being most te- diously and most uselessly minute; beside, such minute ra- mifications do not, in any two individuals, follow the same course. Nor do I intend, from books, to draw up an account of all the varieties which have occurred, as to the origin and course of the arteries. All I shall aim at is, to describe those varieties which are most important, in a practical point of view, and such as have fallen under my own notice. Every deviation from the usual distribution of the common or external carotid, subclavian, humeral, and femoral arteries, merits attention, as the organs on which these arteries are distributed are frequently the subjects of chirurgical opera- tions, a3 well as the arteries themselves. All the arteries of the body take their rise from the Pulmo- nary Artery and Aorta.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 188 Of the Testes of the Foetus. The testes of the foetus in utero are very small, and nearly of the same form as in the adult. They are placed below the kidneys, and are fixed to the fore-part of the psoae mus- cles by peritonaeum, and with their edges directed somewhat forwards. The testes are of a yellowish grey colour, and of a soft and pulpy texture. The peritonaeum covers the body of the testes: the vas deferens descends, and is turned inwards below that process of peritonaeum which Mr J. Hunter has called the Guber- naculuni, along the bladder of urine; at this period there is no spermatic chord. According to Mr Hunter, the gubernaculum is soft and vascular, and is covered by the fibres of the cremaster mus- cle, which is directed upwards, and lost upon the peritonaeum, near to the testes. About the eighth month the testes generally descend from the abdomen, through a canal formed by the peritonaeum, to- gether with the spermatic vessels. At first there is a direct communication between the cavity of the abdomen and the vaginal coat of the testicle. Before the testes have reached the scrotum, it is very small, and much corrugated. The testes generally descend (or as the head of the foetus is generally undermost, ascend) into the scrotum about the seventh month, frequently later, and sometimes not until the period of puberty : in some instances they have remained in the abdomen throughout life. When the testes have reached their destined situation, the canals through which they had passed are generally obliterated, w but, on other occasions, the canals through which they have passed remain open, or are shut at their top or middle only. Wrisberg, who has devoted much attention to this de- partment of anatomy, gives a- table of 103 births. The children, whose weight did not exceed 5 lb., were 3

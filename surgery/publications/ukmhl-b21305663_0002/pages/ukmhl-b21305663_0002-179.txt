MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. 141 but it is difficult to cure the disorder until the system be strengthened. A prolapsus ani is also occasioned by the irritable state of the rectum, or of the neighbouring parts ; as from stone with- in the bladder, cancer of the womb or of the vagina,â€”from such irritation as not only increases the natural action of that bowel, but occasions strong contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, which produces the inversion of the rectum more readily than of any other part of the intestine, as, by its being fixed, it cannot elude the effect of the pressure. In some instances the mucous membrane of the rectum only has been protruded ; it becomes swollen, and, owing to the pressure on the veins, a watery fluid is effused between the coats of the protruded bowel, which adds much to its bulk. As the prolapsed portion of the intestine is not supported by the con- tiguous parts, it continually becomes longer, and, at length, by the sphyncter ani which encircles it, a strangulation en- sues ; and owing to the pressure preventing the flow of blood to the prolapsed portion of intestine, an inflammation comes on, which is succeeded by gangrene. This is the most unfavourable termination of the complaint. When this disorder has been neglected, and when the mu- cous lining of the rectum has been for some time exposed to the air, like other mucous membranes in similar situations, it loses its natural sensibility, becomes harder, and not unlike to the skin, so that it creates no uneasiness, excepting what arises from the bulk of the swelling. Of the Transferscilis Perincei. This muscle is placed in the posterior part of the perinae- um, and towards the middle of the space between the anus and bulb of the urethra, and is always covered by a good deal of fat, even in persons who are rather emaciated. This muscle is not constant as to the precise place of its origin : it arises by a tendon, and sometimes by fleshy fibres, from the fatty substance that covers the ascending branch of

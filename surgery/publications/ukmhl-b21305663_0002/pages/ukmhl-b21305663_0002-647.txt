OF THE FCETUS. 61S membrana pupillaris. The skin then hangs loosely on the body, which gives it a shrivelled appearance. In the seventh month, it is eleven inches. During the last three months, the foetus grows rapidly, and it gains more proportionally in breadth than in length. About the sixth week, the limbs begin to grow and appear like little buds. In the second month, they are a little elon- gated ; and about the beginning of the third month, or a little after, the fingers and toes are formed. Professor Scemmeiukg has remarked, even in the foetus between the third and fourth month, the greatest difference in the thorax of the sexes; that the male is not only longer and more conical, but also much more prominent in respect to the abdomen and pelvis, than the female. The female chest is not only shorter, but also wider above the fourth rib; below, it is more contracted, and therefore less conical; and it is also farther distant from the pelvis, as a greater space intervenes between the last rib, and spine of the os ilium. He observes, that the form of the head of the male differs from that of the female : it is larger in proportion to the whole body, less rounded, more prominent behind, and flatter in the crown. He also remarks, that the arms of the male are a lit- tle longer than those of the female ; the fore-arms fuller, and the scapulae larger and more prominent. According to Scemmering the inferior extremities of the male are more contracted, and the thighs are more slender. At the 4 month, the foetus is equal to 5 inches in length, 6 8 or 9 inches long, 7 11 or 12 8 15 9 20 according to Roe- DEllER. The female is rather less than the male, and when there are twins each foetus is commonly much less than when there is only one child. Males are larger than females, and the head is in circum-

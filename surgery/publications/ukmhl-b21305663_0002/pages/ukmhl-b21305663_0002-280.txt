ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. 236 semilunar valves of the aorta; they are nearly equal in size, and have been called, from their position, Anterior and Pos- terior, or right and left. The right or anterior, or larger, runs between the right au- ricle and ventricle; it usually divides into three branches. The superior runs in the groove between the auricle and ventricle, and supplies the base of the heart, and anastomoses with the left posterior coronary. The second branch passes along the thin edge of the heart to the apex of it; and the third, the largest branch, fills the groove in the inferior sur- face. The left' coronary artery passes between the left auricle and ventricle, and is subdivided into anterior and posterior branches, which are distributed upon the base, and upon the left side of the heart, and a branch along the septum to the point of the heart. This artery anastomoses with small branches of the inter- nal mammary, and phrenic arteries. I have sometimes seen the coat of these arteries partially- converted into bone, in the bodies of persons who have died from the disorder called Angina Pectoris. SECTION I. OF THE ARTERIES WHICH ARISE FROM THE ARCH OF THE AORTA. Three large trunks commonly arise from the arch of the aorta, the Arterja Innominata, common to the right ca- rotid and right subclavian arteries, and the left carotid and left subela,vian, which are separate trunks. But sometimes there are only two trunks from the arch ; and sometimes four ; viz. a right subclavian and right carotid, and a left subclavian and left carotid. The ArUria Innominata is not of an uniform length and size. It lies over the windpipe, and is covered at its rise by the vena innominata, by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and the uppermost piece of the breast-bone.

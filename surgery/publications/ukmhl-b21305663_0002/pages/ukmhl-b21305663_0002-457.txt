OF THE IRIS OR MOVEABLE CURTAIN. 411 The long ciliary arteries which supply the opposite sides of the iris freely anastomose with each other; and the smaller vessels of the iris form a circle around the pupil. The iris is supplied with nerves by the branches of the ciliary nerves; and these are larger ahd numerous in pro- portion to the bulk of the organ. The motions of the iris are involuntary, and depend on the quality of light which falls on the retina ; for light falling on the iris itself does not occasion the contraction.of the pupil; hence, when the retina loses its sensibility, the iris does not move, but remains much dilated. Upon examining a minute object, the pupil is contracted, to exclude the most divergent rays of light, which could not be united on the retina. But in some animals, as the parrot, the movements of the iris are voluntary. In the foetus in utero, about the sixth month, the pupil is closed by a very thin membrane, called therefore membrana pupillaris, and after the vessels of the iris have been success- fully filled, vessels may be seen passing to the very centre of the membrane of the pupil. In the centre of the membrana pupillaris, there is a trans- parent portion. This membrane gradually disappears, so that when the child is born there is generally no vestige of it. In one in- stance, I had occasion to see a part of it in a healthy child of ten months old : it appeared like a greyish film. Of the Aqueous Humour. The aqueous humour is contained within the two different chambers: the anterior or larger is placed between the cornea and iris; and the posterior between the iris and crystalline lens. By tins humour the cornea is distended, so as to assist in collecting the rays of light. 1 he aqueous humour also serves as a defence to the iris and crystalline lens. This humour in the adult is remarkably pellucid, in order that the light may readily be transmitted through it, but in

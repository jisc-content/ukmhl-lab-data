ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 498 On examining the appearances after death, I found that the divided portions of the left par vagum had retracted from each other, and that the opposite ends were united by a slen- der cord, which was like a nerve in colour and texture. The carotid artery was obliterated for two inches. On the right side, about one inch and three quarters had been cut out; there was an evident enlargement at the divided extremities, and there was the formation of a new cord, which reunited the divided portions of the nerve; and this cord in all re- spects to the eye resembled a nerve, for I did not wish to de- stroy the preparation, by trying the effects of an acid or solu- tion of an alkali upon it, as the new formation of nervous substance, when a nerve has been divided, has been sufficient- ly proved by the experiments of Mr Cruickshank, Dr Haighton, Mayer and other authors. I made also four different experiments upon the sympathetic nerve, with the view of determining its influence upon the sound of the voice, and upon the functions of the animal economy. In some;of the experiments, a portion of the nerve on one side was removed, and in others considerably more than an inch of both sympathetic nerves were cut out. Exper. 1. July 5. The sympathetic nerve of the left side of a rabbit was divided about half an inch above the first rib, and an inch of it was cut. The animal was imme- diately seized with a tremulous motion all over the body. Soon afterwards it could readily run about, from place to place; and about an hour after the experiment ate a good deal of clover. July 8. The wound made has now nearly healed; the animal runs about freely, eats a good deal, and dungs also. July 10. The wound is now completely cicatrized. The animal runs about with great vigour, and seems in perfect health. Exper. 2. July 6. About an inch of the sympathetic nerve of another rabbit, on each side of the neck, was cut out.

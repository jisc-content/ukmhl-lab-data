441 OF THE SENSE OF HEAllING. SECTION III. OF THE EAR, AND OF THE SENSE OF HEARING. An organ of hearing has been detected by anatomists, even in the mollusca and insects, and in all vertebral animals. The structure of the most essential part of the ear, on which the sense of hearing chiefly depends, is the same in all animals. It consists of a membranous capsule, filled by a fluid, upon which the smaller branches of the portio mollis are distribu- ted ; but the accessory parts of the organ of hearing are dif- ferently constructed in the different classes of animals, and admirably adapted to their peculiar economy. Bv the sense of hearing we are made sensible to the im- pressions which vibrating bodies communicate to the atmos- phere. The ear being impressed by the vibratory movements of elastic bodies, transmits these to the brain. In the mammalia and birds, besides the impression which may be communicated to the nerves of the ear by the tremor of the whole bones of the head, a distinct impression is con- veyed, 1st, by the chain of bones, cartilages, and ligaments, regulated by their muscles, which connects the membrane of the drum to the membrane of the oval hole. 2d, We receive a pretty distinct impression by the medium of the air contained in the cavity of the tympanum of the ear. 3d, The impression of sound is conveyed from the mem- branes of the round and oval holes to the portio mollis, by the medium of the watery fluid which fills the vestible, the semicircular canals, and cochlea. “ When we compare,” says my Father, “ the mammalia and birds with the amphibia and fishes, we understand the reason of some principal differences of structure. “ The whale, though he seems at first sight amphibious, has the same structure of heart and lungs as man ; and is there- fore obliged to breathe air frequently, and regularly, and to

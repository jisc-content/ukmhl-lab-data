86 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. tilages, there are several mucous glands which are grouped together, and of a pale red colour; these in some persons are much more conspicuous than in others, and have been called the Arytenoid Mucous Glands. Of the Thyroid Gland. The Thyroid Gland is loosely connected with the neigh- bouring parts situated immediately beneath the larynx, upon the uppermost cartilaginous rings of the trachea, and covered by the sterno-thyroid, sterno-hyoid, and omohyoid muscles. This gland is of a yellow or pale red colour, though supplied by numerous and large bloodvessels, but sometimes it is as red as a portion of muscle. This gland varies in size very much in different individuals. It is generally larger in the female than in the male, and pro- portionally larger in the foetus than in the adult. It is ge- nerally composed of two distinct lobes of unequal size, gene- rally united by a small transverse flat band, the thickness of which is very various; but, in some cases, it resembles a horseâ€™s shoe, with the concavity directed upwards; and, in a very few instances, the middle portion isawanting, so that there are two thyroid glands. This gland is covered by a condensed cellular sheath, with- in which there is in some cases a muscle, called by Haller the Levator Glandules Thyroidea, and by Soemmering, the Muscidus Glandules Thyroideee. The above muscle takes its rise from the base of the os hyoides; its fibres are expanded upon the thyroid gland, and by its action may tend to elevate this gland. This is a conglomerate gland, the larger lobes of which consist of smaller lobules; but the smaller lobes are not so distinct as those of many other glands. This gland receives its blood by four large arteries, which are derived from the external carotid and subclavian arteries. The corresponding veins, which are also of large size, termi- nate in the jugular and subclavian veins. No excretory duct has hitherto been discovered.

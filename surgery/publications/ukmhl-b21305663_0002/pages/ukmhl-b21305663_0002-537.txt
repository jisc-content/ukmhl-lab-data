NERVES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 491 This lingual branch gives nerves to the sublingual gland, and the muscles of the tongue. This lingual branch of the fifth pair then divides into five or six branches, which supply the point of the tongue, and terminate upon its papillae; which have been very minutely and fully described by Albinus *. The trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve sends off from its under part a ganglion, from which nerves are sent to the inferior maxillary gland. Upon the peculiar distribution of this nerve my Grandfa- ther has endeavoured to account for the convulsive contrac- tion of the muscles of the lower jaw, the pain in the ear, wreat flow of saliva, and difficult deglutition, which accom- pany an irritation of the nerves of the teeth of the lower jaw. There is a branch derived from the third part of the fifth pair, which descends between the condyle of the under jaw and the parotid gland ; and it gives two or three small nerves to the meatus, and which pass outwards, and are distributed upon the external cartilage of.the ear; and have been called, by Halle it, the Auricular Nerves. The main trunk of the nerve passes between the pterygoid muscles, and then sinks into the foramen, between the condy- loid and coronoid processes of the under-jaw. During the progress of the nerve through the canal of the under-jaw, it sends off several small nerves, which penetrate the substance of the bone, and also supply the teeth of the undeivjaw. The nerve then emerges at the anterior mental hole, and is distri- buted upon the muscles of the fore-part of the chin. Of the Seventh Pair of Nerves. The origin of the seventh pair of nerves has been already described, and also the distribution of the part called the Por- tia mollis, upon the internal ear. The course of the portio dura, across the internal ear, has also been described. The portio dura passes through the foramen stylo-mastoi- * Vide his Annt. Acad.

130 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. pass over the upper aperture of the pelvis, and where they pass obliquely between the coats of the bladder. It has been stated, that the whole of the urine does not pass through the ureters into the bladder, but that there are pores or passages, through which it passes directly from the stomach to the bladder. But, considering the difference be- tween what we drink, and the urine, the density of the in- tervening membranes, the varied situation of the bladder of urine in different animals, such an hypothesis seems very improbable; and it may be fully disproved, by putting ligatures around the ureters, after which no urine passes into the bladder. The ureters are composed of three coats, viz. of an outer white coat, formed chiefly of condensed cellular substance; of a muscular coat, the fibres of which are disposed in a trans- verse direction and of an internal mucous coat, which is, like other mucous membranes, perforated by the orifices of a number of small ducts. All of these coats admit of being greatly expanded, and often are so when calculi impacted within them prevent the free passage of the urine into the bladder. Calculi imbedded within the ureters have sometimes proved a cause of death. SECTION II. OF THE URINE, AMD OF URINARY CONCRETIONS. The Urine is a pale yellow-coloured fluid, which has a slight- ly bitter taste, and emits, when recently voided, an acid odour, but after being kept, the odour is distinctly alkaline. The urine differs much in its properties at different periods of life, and according to the kind of food, and especially when the digestive organs are weak. The quantity of urine secreted depends upon the quantity of fluid that is drunk, and very much upon the state of the other secretions, especially upon the quantity of sweat and perspiration. According to Berzelius, the following are the ingredients of 1000 parts of urine.

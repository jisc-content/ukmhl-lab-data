113 OF THE FtETAI. CIRCULATION. SECTION IV. OF THIS STATE OF THE CIRCULATING SYSTEM OF THE FCETUS. Before concluding respecting the organs of circulation, it seems necessary to subjoin a few observations respecting the state of the circulating system of the foetus. The heart and arteries of the fetus are proportionally larger than in the adult: the arteries are also more name- Â© rous, and their coats are more elastic and tougher. The heart of the fetus is more rounded, and is not placed so obliquely as in the adult. But the size of the arteries of the fetus is not uniform through the whole body ; it is propor- tioned to the development of the particular organs. Thus those of the brain, spinal chord, thymus gland and liver, are in the fetus of a greater proportional size than in the adult, whereas those of the pelvis are proportionally of less size, with the exception of the umbilical arteries. In the fetus there is a greater number of small arteries near to the surface of the body, than in the adult, and the skin, at the period of birth, is of a red colour. There are other peculiarities as to the circulating system. Thus, in the fetus, the ophthalmic artery is proportionally larger, and those branches of it which are distributed upon the capsule of the crystalline lens are so large as to admit the red blood or red powder of vermilion; but, in the adult, they are so small as to receive only the more watery and colour- less part of the blood. It has been already observed, that there is in the adult a particular circulation through the lungs, and a general circu- lation through the body at large. But as the fetus in utero does not breathe, there can be said to be, at that period, only a circulation through the body at large; for a very small quantity of blood, such only as is sufficient for their nutrition, passes through the lungs, in the fetal state; the greater share of the stream being diverted from that organ, by a direct com- VOL.

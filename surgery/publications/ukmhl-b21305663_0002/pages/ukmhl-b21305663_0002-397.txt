OF THE ARACHNOID COAT. S51 Within these sinuses the internal carotid arteries are placed. The arteries of the anterior part of the dura mater are de- rived from the ocular artery; those on the middle part from a branch of the external carotid; those of the posterior part from the vertebral arteries; and these arteries are accom- panied by veins, which enter the sinuses, at the base of the brain. The dura mater being a serous membrane, is liable to in- flammation, and all other organic derangements peculiar to membranes of a similar description. The dura mater also lodges the venous sinuses of the brain; and, owing to its tough and unelastic nature, and to the sinuses being lodged in grooves of the skull, or be- ing connected with the falx or tentorium cerebello-super- extensum, these sinuses cannot be extended, so as to com- press the brain, or ruptured; and, on the other hand, their opposite sides cannot be compressed, by the weight of the brain, to such a degree, as to interrupt the flow of blood through them. I have made a number of experiments upon the dura ma- ter of living animals, and invariably found, that a portion of the skull might be removed by the trephine, with impunity; but if the dura mater was cut, the animals, in a short time, became excessively feverish, and generally died in a day or two, from an inflammation of the brain. Pieces of bone are sometimes formed between the lami- nae of the dura mater. I have seen these vei’y large; and, in an epileptic boy, there were pieces of bone of various sizes con- nected with a newly formed, and very vascular, thin mem- brane, which lined the dura mater. Of the Arachnoid Coat. This very thin coat lines the dura mater. It has been cal- led Arachnoid, on account of its extreme thinness and resem- blance to a spider’s web. It is spread over the convolutions of the brain, but does not penetrate between them. This thin membrane does not adhere to the dura or pia

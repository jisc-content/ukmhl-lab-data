OF THE POPLITEAL ANEURISM. 301 more superficial at the head of the fibula, sends a few small branches to the cavity of the joint, and anastomoses with the superior external, and superior internal, articular artery, un- der the ligament of the patella. The fifth articular artery has been called the Arteria Me- dia: it is situated between the condyles of the thigh-bones, and suddenly subdivides into many small branches, which are distributed upon the capsular ligament and fat of the poste- rior part of the knee-joint. As the femoral and popliteal arteries are covered by fat, cellular substance, and lymphatic glands, if these shall fall into a stale of suppuration, they receive pulsation from the subjacent artery, and the tumour may be mistaken for an aneurism. An aneurism which has recently appeared, becomes flac- cid when the flow of blood to it is intercepted by pressure between it and the heart, and the bulk of the tumour is ma- terially lessened; and upon the pressure being taken off, the tumour regains its former bulk: on the other hand, if the pressure be made below the aneurism, the tumour becomes still more tense, and the pulsation of it is more violent. If the pulsation of a tumour be derived from a subjacent artery, it ceases as soon as the tumour is pulled away from that artery; but when a tumour acquires a pulsation from an artery passing through it, the diagnosis is difficult. On account of the impediment to the free flow of blood presented by the arch, described by the popliteal artery, when the knee is bent, and the circulation at the same time accele- rated, that artery is apt to fall into a morbid state; hence the greater frequency of popliteal aneurism amongst coachmen, dragoons and others who ride on horseback. The situation of the artery, in respect to the accompanying vein and artery, affords a ready explanation of the symptoms that characterise this aneurism, and of the consequences of it. The accompanying nerve is elevated, and put upon the stretch, and is the cause of the pain which the patient experi- ences in the knee. When the tumour has attained a considerable size, the le" ' D

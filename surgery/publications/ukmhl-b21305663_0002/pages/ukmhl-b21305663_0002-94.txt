ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. T Vide Plate III. • Vide Hate II. £8 scribed, pulsating- tumour *; this forms what has been called the circumscribed true aneurism. In some cases of this description, the tumour is of an ob- long figure, not distinctly circumscribed ; and hence has been called the diffused true aneurism. In the second variety of aneurism, a sac is found attached to the side of the artery, with which it communicates by a narrow neck. This kind of aneurism has been particularly described by Sennertus and Scarpa. The main trunk of the artery, to which the aneurism is attached, sometimes preserves its na- tural size ; but on other occasions is considerably expanded -f*. All aneurisms, according to Scarpa, are occasioned by a solution of continuity, or rupture of the muscular and inner- most coats of an artery, which is occasioned by a wound, a ■steatomatous, or earthy degeneration, or a corroding ulcer : hence the blood is effused into the neighbouring cellular sub- stance, which is condensed into a cyst. In some rare cases the coats of an artery are extended par- tially in four or five different places, forming what has been called the saccidated aneurism. My Grandfather has described what he has called a mixed aneurism, or that kind of aneurism which is formed by the rupture of the true aneurism, and the consequent effusion of blood in the adjacent cellular substance. A dilatation of a cluster of the smaller arteries sometimes takes place, forming the aneurism by anastomosis of Mr John Bell. When an unnatural communication is established between a vein and the artery which lies under it, this has been called, by Dr W. Hunter, the varicose aneurism. A wound of an artery has been said, by authors, to form a false aneurism. The blood sometimes insinuates itself a- long the course of the principal artery and vein of the limb, constituting an irregular oblong aneurism. This has been called the diffused false aneurism.

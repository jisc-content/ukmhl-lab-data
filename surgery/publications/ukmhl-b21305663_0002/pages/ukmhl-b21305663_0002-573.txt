OF THE DOItSAL NERVES. 537 reflected along with the branches of the intercostal mammary artery, which are ultimately spent upon the mammae. The lower intercostal nerves supply the adjacent muscles, and also the abdominal muscles, and the skin of the belly. The twelth intercostal nerve sends nerves which extends to the integuments of the pelvis. Of the Thoracic part of the Sympathetic Nerve. According to Lobstein, the Sympathetic nerve is a con- tinued cord, passing from the head to the pelvis, which has various ganglia connected with it, and which is very rarely distinctly interrupted. The Sympathetic nerve passes over the head of the first rib, and the heads of the other ribs, and forms ganglia with the intercostal nerves, which enters the ganglia by two branches. My Father has minutely described the structure of these ganglia, and also Professor Scarpa *,—these au- thors differ but little in their descriptions of these ganglia. Within these few years Weber-f* and Wutzer| have also published on the ganglia of the nerves, and Lobstein has very lately directed his attention to the same subject, in his book upon the Sympathetic Nerve. The ganglia are, like the brain, composed of a grey and of a white substance, which latter, like the nerves, is of a fibrous structure. The fibres which enter the ganglia lay aside their neurilma. Scarpa has described a fatty substance, as existing in the ganglia of fat subjects, but this I have pot observed: I agree with Lobstein in opinion, that it is rather a yellowish jelly. Concerning this jelly Lobstein has observed, that he had found it most abundant in dropsical persons. He has added, “ Frequentior etiam in junioribus hominibus; quo fit ut ganglia aliquam pe 1 luciditatem abeunt.

OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 45 delivery, the bulk of the organ, and also that of its arteries, is ruich diminished. In the same manner, the arteries in the vicinity of a tumour acquire an unnatural size; but upon the tumour being removed, they shrink ; but if that tumour cannot be removed, the increase in the size of the vessels is permanent. The arteries of the placenta are peculiar as to their course. They follow a long and tortuous course, and do not diminish in size until they divide into many branches upon the sub- stance of the placenta. Comparative Vascularity. There are many more bloodvessels proper to the several organs of a young, than to those of an old animal. In old age, the heart loses its force, and many of the smaller bloodvessels are obliterated; the skin, having then less blood than in early life, becomes of a paler colour; it loses its former pliability, becoming hard and scaly ; the muscles lose their former red colour and suppleness ; and the coats of the arteries become more rigid, and are frequently converted into bone. It is a general law, that, during the formation of a part, it is more amply supplied with*., bloodvessels than after it has been completely formed. All parts which are active, are most liberally supplied with blood. Thus, the bones, tendons, ligaments, and other serous membranes, receive but a scanty supply of blood, while a large quantity of blood is sent to the muscles, glands, and organs of sense. In some cases, blood is suddenly determined to a part, in order to increase its sensibility. In old age, on the other hand, a great many of the arteries are obliterated. Of the Terminations of the Arteries. The arteries terminate in different ways. Most of the branches of the arteries, whether conveying the red or the colourless part of the blood, terminate directly in veins. Those arteries which are of so small a size, as to admit on-

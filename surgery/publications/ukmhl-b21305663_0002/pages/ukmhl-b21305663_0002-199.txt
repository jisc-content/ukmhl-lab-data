OF THE PENIS. 161 We also sometimes meet with boys who have pushed the prepuce so far back, that it cannot be pushed forward again, and this occasions much pain, swelling and inflammation, which sometimes is followed by gangrene; this state is called Paraphymosh. Sometimes at the period of birth the prepuce is split, or it is too short, or awanting, or the prepuce has been destroyed by ulceration and sloughing. Paraphymosis is most frequent from the thickened prepuce being, during coition, forced backwards behind the glans, and not being brought forwards, in which circumstances, the con- stricted prepuce acts as a tight ligature. The membrane of the corpora cavernosa penis is of a pale grey colour, elastic, thick, firm, strong, and distensible; not easily divided by the knife ; evidently fibrous, and the greater number of these fibres are disposed in a longitudinal direction. This membrane is not of an uniform thickness; it is rather thinner at the anterior extremities of the crura penis, and where it lines the groove for the urethra, than elsewhere. This membrane is closely connected with the periosteum of the ossa ischia. The corpora cavernosa penis, which are to the touch soft and loose in the undistended state, are placed side by side as far as the symphysis pubis, and united laterally two thirds of their whole length. Behind the symphysis pubis they diverge somewhat like the strokes of the letter V, and terminate in two small round- ed bodies, each of which forms a cul de sac, and is united by ligamentous fibres to the ascending branch of the os ischium. The anterior extremity of each corpus cavernosum is a blind sac, which is received into a concavity at the base of the glans penis, to which they are firmly fixed by cellular sub- stance and a few bloodvessels. But the corpora cavernosa penis and glans penis do not communicate, lor even air does not pass from the one to the other. VOL. II. L

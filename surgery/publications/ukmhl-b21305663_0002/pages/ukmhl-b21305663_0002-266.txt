The clitoris not only resembles the penis in appearance, but also in structure ; it is made up of two penes. The clitoris, as to its structure, is in all respects similar to the penis of the male, excepting in being unconnected with the urethra. It has its proper suspensory ligament; has the same kind of investing membrane ; has its glans ; is composed of two crura, which take their origin from the ossa ischia; it has its proper fraenum ; the crura clitoridis are covered by their erector muscles, which arise from the ossa ischia, and are fixed intb the body of the clitoris; internally it consists chiefly of a plexus of tortuous veins; and lastly, like the pe- nis, it is distended in coitu. The clitoris sometimes attains an extraordinary size, and when a source of inconvenience, may be extirpated, which, according to Bruce and Brown *, is a religious ceremony. Of the Lahici Interna. The Labia Interna, or Nymphae, are placed on each side of the vagina ; they descend from the fraenum of the clitoris. The labia interna, or nymphae, are spongy bodies, which are in young women of a pale red or purplish colour, and de- scend from the fraenum clitoridis on each side of the orifice of the vagina. The nymphae are thin and flattened, and rather broader in the middle than at either extremity, or somewhat in form like the labia externa. They are generally fully covered by the labia externa, un- less when these are separated. The nymphae possess a considerable share of sensibility. The nymphae are generally, in European women, about an inch long, but in warmer climates are sometimes much longer and broader, and project beyond the labia externa; in the â€¢ See their Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria.

386 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. having produced two swellings or ganglia, the optic thalami, and corpora striata, each terminate by a lamina which, bent from before backward, and from the side towards the superior and internal part, forms the commencement of the hemisphere of the brain. These membranes, and thin hemispheres, are so small at the second month, that they scarcely cover the corpora striata. In proportion as they increase, they extend backward, and cover, at the third month, the optic thalami; at the fourth, the tubercula quadrigemina, and at the sixth or seventh, the cerebellum. The lateral ventricles result from their inversion. “ 5. The medullary fibres of the pyramidal cords, previously to the formation of the tuber annulare, are immediately con- tinuous with those of the crura cerebri, from whence the eye may readily trace them, in the optic thalami and corpora striata, and see them afterwards spreading and radiating in the hemispheres. « 6. The parietes of the hemispheres gradually increase in thickness, in proportion as new strata of cerebral substance are deposited on their surface, and convolutions are not decidedly seen till towards the close of pregnancy CHAP. III. OF THE ORGANS OF THE SENSES. BY the Senses, we acquire a knowledge of external objects, which is communicated to the brain through the medium of the nerves. The external senses'are five in number; those ot Touch, Taste, Smell, Hearing, and Seeing. To each of these organs * Vide Load* Med. Reposit. vol. xv. p. 310.

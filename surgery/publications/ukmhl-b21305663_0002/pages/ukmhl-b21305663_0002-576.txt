ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. .530 The nature of these bodies is unknown. The ccemac ganglion covers the aorta, and the roots of the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries, from which a ner- vous plexus is derived, which covers the trunks and branches of the coeliac and the superior mesenteric arteries. From this ganglion the hepatic plexuses are also derived. From the right hepatic plexus, the right extremity of the pancreas is supplied ; the pyloric portion of the stomach ; the duodenum, and the greater curvature of the stomach. The branches of the hepatic plexus also accompany the branches of the hepatic artery and vena portarum through the substance of the liver ; and are also distributed upon the gall- bladder and biliary ducts. The splenic plexus of nertes accompanies the splenic ar- tery, and also the smaller branches of the splenic artery, into the substance of the spleen. The superior and inferior mesenteric Plexus of Nerves form sheaths, which envelope the trunks and branches of the corresponding arteries. From these sheaths, very small nerves are derived, which are distributed over the surface of the mesentery, and the mesenteric glands. The nerves of the colon are proportionally larger than those of the smaller intestines, and are frequently united. The inferior plexus of nerves is continued downwards along the bloodvessels of the left portion of the colon, and the intes- tinum curvum. The aorta is included within a plexus of nerves, called the Hypogastric: this passes over the aorta, where it lies upon the lowest lumbar vertebrae, and divides into right and left parts, which are distributed upon the bowels of the pelvis. Some authors have described the omental pancreatic umbi- lical plexus, but these are only branches, derived from the so- lar plexus. Of the Nerves. Mr Swan has described nerves from the great sympathe-

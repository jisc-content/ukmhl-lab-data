OF TttE LABIA INTERNA* 227 The labia externa and nymph* become smaller, softer, and more flaccid. At so early a period of life as the second or third year, the organs of generation are proportionally larger than most of the other parts of the human frame. The mons veneris is then apparent; the labi* are well formed ; the nymph* are long; and the clitoris of a large size,—sometimes, indeed, of so larce a size as to lead to a mistake as to the sex. O The vagina is proportionally longer than after puberty, and the rug* upon it are very distinct and beautifuli The ute- rus is also large, but not exactly of the same form as that of the adult; the neck of it is proportionally larger and rounder than that of the adult. Of the Relative Situation and Connection of the Female Organs of Generation. The lateral view of the pelvis is the most favourable for ex-, habiting the relative situation and connection of the contents of the female pelvis. The upper and back part of the bladder is covered by the periton*um, which is reflected upon the back part of the va- gina, the cervix and the fundus uteri. It then descends and covers the posterior part of the uterus, which therefore is in- cluded in a doubling of the periton*um, which forms what has been called The Broad Ligament of the Womb. From the womb, the periton*um passes to the rectum and os sacrum; thus the womb may be readily expanded, and as- cend into the abdomen. From the preceding description of the course of the peri- tonaeum, it follows, that the anterior of the body and heck of the womb are not invested by the periton*um, but are in im- mediate contact with the bladder of urine. The tubes connected with the fundus uteri, called Fallo- pian or Uterine, the ovaria, the bloodvessels and nerves, and round ligament of the womb, are also included within the upper part of the duplication of the periton*um, called Broad Ligament. r 9>

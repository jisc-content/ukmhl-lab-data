OF GANGLIA OF NERVES. S27 the structure of the ganglia, has observed: “ Upon the whole, all the nerves which issue from ganglia seem to be formed by a combination of threads, from many sources; and, besides this, the nerves, in their passage through a ganglion, seem to receive new energy from the vascular matter of the gan- glion.” My Father has thus described the ganglia: “ First, Seve- ral branches of the nerves, which enter a ganglion, run upon its surface, separating from each other, and joining again, so as to form new combinations of threads at the other end of the ganglion. Secondly, When we cut a ganglion, we are so far from finding that the course of the nerves is interrupted within it, or that it is a substance, totally different in its na- ture from the nerves that enter it, that we are able to trace, in every part of the ganglion, nerves distinguishable by such folds or joints, as are seen in them in all other places. Third- ly, In the substance of the ganglion, we see nervous cords leading from any one nerve, connected to the ganglion, to the greater number of, if not to all, the other nerves connected with it; from which we may conclude, that various other combinations of the nervous threads take* place within it. Fourthly, It appears very difficult, in many instances, to dis- tinguish all the nerves which enter a ganglion, from those which are sent off from it; and, of course, it is difficult, or impossible, to determine all the sources from which any branch sent off from the ganglion, is derived. For example, although the nerves, at the upper end of a thoracic ganglion, of the great sympathetic nerve, are composed chiefly of de- scending branches; and, in like manner, the two nerves which tie it to the proper dorsal nerve, are chiefly derived from the dorsal, yet there seem to be ascending branches from the nerves below, and others sent outwards, from the ganglion, to the proper dorsal nerve; and probably the splanchnic nerves receive threads from all these sources. Fifthly, The nerves which issue from ganglia seem, as authors have ac- knowledged, to he more bulky than the nerves zee may sup- pose to enter ganglia; yet I have not been able to discover, that the coats of the nerves going out were thicker, or diffe-

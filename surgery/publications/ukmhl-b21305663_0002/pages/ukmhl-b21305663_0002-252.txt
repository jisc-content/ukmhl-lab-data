ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 212 Explanation of Plate IX. Fig. I. Represents the inside of the bladder after the mu- cous membrane lining that organ had been removed. Considerable pains have been taken to represent the distribu- tion of the muscular fibres around the neck of the bladder, concerning which, anatomical authors have published very different descriptions. Some authors have affirmed, that no such muscle exists as a sphyncter of the neck of the blad- der. 1. The aperture through which the urine passes. , The numbers 2. 2. are placed upon the trigone. The numbers 3. 3. point out the strong muscular fibres of the bladder passing across it, behind the trigone. Fig. 2. Represents a section of the ovarium of a girl of nine years of age. Figs. 3. and 4. Represent an ovarium at the second month of pregnancy; fig. 3. represents the outer side, and fig. 4. a section of the ovarium *. SECTION XI. OF THE ORGANS OF GENERATION OF THE FEMALE. IN treating of the Organs of Generation of the Female, it is proposed to describe them as they appear in a virgin in the meridian of life. The female organs may be divided into the internal and external; the internal are, the Ovaria, Uterus, Fallopian Tubes, and Vagina ; the external are the Mons Veneris, Labia Externa, Nymphae, Clitoris, and Hymen. * The drawings of the ovaria, from which the engravings were copied, were made forty years ago, by Mr T, Donaldsoi*.

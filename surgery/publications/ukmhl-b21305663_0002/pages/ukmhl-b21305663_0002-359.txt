OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 313 CHAP. I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES. 1 HE Nervous System is the medium by which we are con- nected with, and acquire a knowledge of, external objects. There is in us a principle which feels, thinks, reasons, and from which all our voluntary actions are derived. By the nerves, impressions which are made on their sen- tient extremities are propagated to the brain, and sensation is produced ; but in what manner this takes place, or what is the exact seat of the sensorium commune, or centre of sensation, to which all impressions communicated by the nerves are transmitted, has not hitherto been explained; nor has any light been thrown on the connection subsisting between the mind and the nervous system. Anatomists and physiologists of all ages have devoted much attention to discover the structure and functions of the brain and nerves, and their labours have been crowned with a cer- tain degree of success; but still much remains to be done, much is still mysterious and obscure, and many opinions which have been propagated have neither been refuted nor confirmed. At this moment, many of the best physiologists of Europe are eager in the pursuit of discoveries relative to the nervous system; every monthly journal teems with a detail of some new experiments on that head ; and much of the obscurity which hangs over this very curious and important subject may perhaps be removed by their combined exertions.

17 OF THE THORAX. Some time ago, an opinion prevailed, that there was a va- cant space between the lungs and the pleura costalis, which led my Father to examine into this fact with attention, and to publish a paper in the Edinburgh Physical Essays, to prove that the lungs arc contiguous to their parietes. SECTION V. OF THE SITUATION AND CONNECTION OF THE VISCERA OF THE THORAX. The contents of the thorn/, may be exposed by dividing the cartilages connecting the ribs to the breast-bone on each side, (by which the sterno-costales muscles are brought into view, extending between the middle of the breast-bone and the third, fourth, and fifth ribs), and then, by raising the breast- bone, having previously cut the connection between it and the diaphragm. While raising the sternum, the two layers of pleura, which form the mediastinum anterius, are distinctly seen: also the triangular cavity between them, opposite to the upper part of the breast-bone, within which the thymus gland, enveloped in a small quantity of fat and cellular substance, is situated. The thorax is lined, and its contents are covered, connected, and supported, by the pleurae,—serous membranes, which are, in all respects, similar to the peritonaeum. The pleurae line the ribs and intercostal muscles, and form sacs for the lungs, of a conical form, which are placed obliquely in respect to each other, and the right is the shorter and broader. The lungs are placed side by side, and do not communicate with each other : hence water, air, pus, or blood, does not pass from one side to the other ; and the lungs of opposite sides being independent of each other, respiration may be continued though the lung of one side has been destroyed. These sacs, which contain the lungs, being nearly in oppo- sition, form the partition of the chest called Mediastinum. vol. ii. „

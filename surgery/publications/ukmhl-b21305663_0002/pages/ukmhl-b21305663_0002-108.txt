78 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. coid cartilage, where it is covered by the thyroid ; and they are inserted into the sides of the bases of the arytenoid carti- lages. These are the antagonists of the preceding muscles ; by their co-operation they separate the arytenoid cartilages from each other, and dilate the glottis. Of the Thyro-Arytenoidei. These muscles, which take their rise from the under and back parts of the thyroid cartilage, or within the concavity of the thyroid cartilage, run upwards upon the side of the glottis and are inserted into the fore part of the arytenoid cartilages. By these muscles the arytenoid cartilages are pulled forwards towards the thyroid, and the vocal chords are shortened. Of the Crico-Thyroidei. These muscles arise from the sides and fore-parts of the cricoid cartilage, and are inserted into the under parts and in- ferior cornua of the thyroid cartilage. These muscles pull the thyroid cartilage forwards, and stretch the vocal chord. * Crico-Arytenoidei Postici. These oblique muscles arise from the back-part of the cri- coid cartilage, and are inserted into the narrow extremity of the back part of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. These muscles pull the arytenoid cartilages backwards ; and when thrown into action at the same time as the crico-thyroid, the vocal chords are fully stretched, or made tense. The larynx receives its blood by the medium of the supe- rior and inferior thyroid arteries. The veins which accompany these arteries areof a large size, and must be divided in opening the larynx ; and from them a considerable quantity of blood has been in some operations lost, which, should it pass into the windpipe, might suffocate the patient. The larynx has also a number of lymphatic vessels, which pass into the lymphatic glands of the neck. The nerves of the larynx are derived from the eighth pair of nerves ; and, it maybe observed, that the superior and in- ferior laryngeal nerves communicate with each other.

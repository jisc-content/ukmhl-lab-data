OF THE CELLS OF THE LUNGS. 91 all the cellular membranes of the body, or to produce univer- sal emphysema, just as, in the anasarca, the water gets along the cellular membranes of the pleura, into the interlobular cellular substance of the lungs, but does not, generally speak- ing, get into the proper cells of the lungs. What has led authors into this opinion is, that they ob- served the air, on inflating a branch of the trachea, pass into the interlobular cellular membrane, and as, in making this experiment, they blew the air in with the force of their own lungs, they conceived there was no rupture of parts, because the air acted as much on their own lungs as on the lungs of the subject, without considering that their own lungs could not be distended so much as to be in danger of bursting, be- cause they are supported by the containing parts of the tho- rax, whereas the lungs of the subject wanting that support, are stretched much beyond their natimal tone, and, there- fore, are easily burst; or that a living person can burst the lungs of a subject after cutting open its thorax, although the lungs of the subject be supposed firmer than those of the living person. And, in fact, I find, if the lungs are sound, that, after dissecting off their common membrane from the pleura, their proper membrane will confine quicksilver poured into one of the branches of the trachea, in such quan- tity as to distend all the proper cells as much as they are distended in life. Or, if the intercostal muscles of a child are all cut off, and a tube fixed into the trachea, if you blow in air gradually, you will not find it get into the interlobular cellular mem- brane, although you distend the lungs till they touch the ribs on all sides. Or if, without opening the thorax, you inject a mixture of wax and tallow well melted and coloured with vermilion, till you find a considerable resistance, that is, till the lungs are well filled with it, you will find the injection has been confined to the proper cells of the lungs. Nay, I f .ye sometimes, in trying this experiment on pur- pose, pushed the injection with force without afterwards find- ing any of the vermilion in the interlobular substance, but

OF THE UTERUS OR WOMB. 217 neck, which is the narrowest portion, bears resemblance in shape to a cylinder. The womb feels hard on pressure, being of a compact tex- ture, and composed of very small fibres, very intimately mat- ted together. The womb of a very fat woman has somewhat of a yellow hue, from the quantity of fat below the peritoneal coat of that organ. In the section of the parietes of the womb, there is a grey substance, which has an appearance like cartilage, more espe- cially at the neck of that organ, and which is intermixed with a reddish fibrous substance. The muscular fibres of the womb, when enlarged by preg- nancv, are very conspicuous; and it has been stated by Har- vey, Veslingius and others, that it contracts many hours af- ter death, and expels its contents *. As the mouth of the womb is composed of denser materi- als, and is harder than any other part of this organ, it has been thought to resemble the mouth of the Tench fish and has been called Os Tincse. The lips of the os tineas of the virgin womb are in immediate contact; but those of wo- men that have had several children are softer, more gap- ing, and not so accurately fitted to each other, and the neck of the womb is more rounded and thicker. Immediately around the os tineas there are a number of mucous glands, from which a gelatinous substance is derived, which fills up the mouth of the pregnant womb. The cavity of the womb is nearly triangular, and bears but a small proportion to the external bulk of the organ, its parietes being very thick. The uterine or Fallopian tubes, are affixed to the fundus uteri. The uterus is lined by a very soft and very vascular mu- cous membrane. This, at the neck of the uterus, is tucked up into rugoe, which are disposed transversely ; and by some have â€¢ See the observations of ray Father and Uncle on the Muscular Structure of the Womb, in the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays. 3

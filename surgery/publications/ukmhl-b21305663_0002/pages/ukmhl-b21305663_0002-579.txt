533 or THE NERVES. Of the Nerves of the Organs of Urine and Generation. A plexus of nerves is derived from the cceliac plexus, and from the great sympathetic nerve, which envelope the renal arteries and their branches. It is divided into an anterior and posterior part, which ac- company the branches of the renal artery within the sub- stance of the kidney. From the renal plexus, there are small nerves, which are distributed upon the renal glands, and also upon the upper portion of the ureter, and the under part of the ureter is supplied with nerves from the hypogastric plexus. There are a few fibres derived from this plexus, which join with nerves from the first and second lumbar nerves which accom- pany the spermatic artery along the spermatic cord to the testes; and in the female they creep along the round liga- ment of the female womb, and some of the smaller branches pass to the ovarium and Fallopian tube. The spermatic nerves, which follow the same course as the spermatic artery, are derived from the renal and aortic plexuses, and form the second lumbar nerves. In Walterâ€™s Plates of the Nerves of the Viscera of the Abdomen and Pelvis, the nerves of the uterus are represent- ed; but Tiedemann has stated, that he has omitted those which issue out from the great hypogastric plexus, and that he did not trace the nerves into the substance of the uterus. Dr William Hunter has faithfully described the origin of the nerves of the uterus from the sympathetic nerve, and also those from the great hypogastric plexus; but, according te Tiedemann, he has made no mention of the inferior ute- rine nerves. Tiedemann therefore supposes, that he has published the most perfect account of the nerves of the uterus; he has traced the nerves in the unimpregnated state, and also after delivery. His own words describing them, are given in a preceding part of this book. It may be added, that the minuter filaments of the nerves

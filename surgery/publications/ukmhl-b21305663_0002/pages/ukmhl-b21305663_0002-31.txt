OF THE PARIETES OF THE HUMAN THORAX. 5 construction and mobility, an immediate reference to the func- tion of the lungs. The thorax has been divided into an anterior part, called the breast; a posterior part, or back ; and into lateral portions or sides. The parietes of the thorax are composed of skin, cellular substance, fat, muscles, bones and membranes. The upper part of the thorax, during life, seems to be the broader: this is owing to the muscles of the shoulders ; whereas, in the well formed skeleton, the under part of the chest is the broader part of it. In a former part of this work *, the shape, situation and attachments of the ribs, and of their cartilages, have been ex- plained. The natural form of the chest is occasionally much changed by the operation of external pressure, of organic derangements of the parts contained within it, and by distortion of the spine. Thus, the female chest is occasionally much contracted and deformed in its lower part, by wearing tight stays, by which the foundation of bad health often is laid ; for thus the func- tions of the stomach, lungs and liver, are deranged. When the spine is distorted, the ribs of one side are brought closer to- gether, and those of the opposite side are proportionally se- parated from each other; the shoulder is raised, and is broader on the one side, while on the other, it is flat, lower, and contract- ed : hence the deformed seldom arrive at old age; they soon become asthmatical, or die in early life, from consumption, or water in the chest; as, on account of the diminished capa- city of the chest, the blood does not circulate freely through the lungs. Inconsequence of rickets, the ribs are still more distort- ed, together with the spine, which is frequently much bent forwards. This is the more dangerous kind of curvature, as the spinal chord, at the angle, is often much compressed, which leads to palsy of the inferior extremities. Vide vol. i. p. 106

366 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. rigid bones cannot by bandage or otherwise, be brought to sup- port the collapsed brain equally, this will be in danger of be- ing broken by the changing the posture of the head ; nay, though these immediately bad consequences should not hap- pen, the distracted fibres of the brain will scarcely recover their tone ; and either the degree of inflammation necessary to cause concretion of the sides of the ventricles, the means nature usually employs to effectuate a cure in dropsical cavities, where the air is admitted, will kill the patient; or, if such inflamma- tion and concretion do not take place, the water will again be collected, or the operation will at best prove only palliative. And, indeed, though I recommend tapping where the water is collected on the outer side of the brain, as sometimes is the ease, since all other methods of cure almost always fail, yet, I confess, I should not even here expect much benefit from the operation. For, without saying, that taking off that pressure suddenly to which the brain had been habituated, might have a very dangerous effect, I should apprehend fatal consequen- ces, partly from the tossing of the brain after the operation in the too much enlarged cranium, and partly from the general inflammation of its surface, to cause the above mentioned con- cretion of the opposite sides of the dropsical cyst, necessary to complete the cure. Further, supposing the patient to survive this inflammation, as the bones will be too large for the brain, and, therefore, not every where nor generally contiguous, these cannot well grow together; and what is also discour- aging, after trepanning sound animals, and cutting the dura mater, I have not found, that the letting in the air on the surface of the dura mater and pia mater, has occasioned the adhesion of these membranes, except in the very place where their fibres were wounded with the knife, without which, if we may reason from the analogy of dropsy in other cysts, the re- lief'will be but temporary *. â€¢ The truth of these observations of my Father, have been fully confirmed by experience, Wepfbr, Muraltus, Lizars, Le Cat, Home, and others, have punctured the brain ; the relief has been but temporary; it became necessary to puncture

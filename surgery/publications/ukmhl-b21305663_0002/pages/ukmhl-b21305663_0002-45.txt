19 OF THE THORAX. That the heart and lungs are so situated,, and so con- nected, that the contractions of the heart cannot interfere with the play of the lungs, nor can the play of the lungs impede the action of the heart. 3d, That as the pleura costalis and pulmonalis are, in the healthy state, always in contact, excepting when the lungs collapse, hence they fill the sacs of the pleura, and correspond in form with the thorax. Uli, That the movements of the parietes of the chest and lungs correspond with each other, and that the air will enter or pass out of the lungs as the chest is enlarged or con- tracted. 5th, That the lungs are contained in distinct capsules, which have no communication with each other: hence the lungs of opposite sides of the chest are independent of each other ; and, as the mediastinum anterius intervenes between them, they cannot press on each other when we lie on either side, excepting when a large quantity of water or purulent matter, accumulated within one of the sacs of the pleura, may, when the patient lies on the sound side, by pressing the mediastinum to the opposite side, and upon the sound lungs, give rise to considerable difficulty in breathing. 6th, That the elasticity of the mediastinum may somewhat contribute to the drawing down of the ribs. 1th, That the contents of the mediastinum posterius can- not be compressed by the weight of the superincumbent parts. 8th, That when air has got out from the left lungs, in con- sequence of their having been wounded by a broken rib, or in consequence of a rupture of their substance, if air be diffused extensively in the subcutaneous cellular substance of the chest, it is often difficult to determine whether the air has been dif- fused into the right or left pleura. If an operation is to be performed for the relief of the patient, an error on the part of the surgeon may prove fatal; for, as the left lung will be al- ready in a state of collapse ; if a puncture be made into the right side of the chest, the patient must die (providing there be no unnatural adhesion of the lungs to the side), in conse- quence of a collapse of the lungs of both sides. b 2

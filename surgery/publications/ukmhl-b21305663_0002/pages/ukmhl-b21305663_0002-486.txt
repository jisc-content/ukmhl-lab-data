ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 440 to the superior oblique muscle and levator palpebrse superio- rs, and to the levator and depressor oculi. T- he continuation of the trunk of the ocular artery, which follows a tortuous course, enters the nose at the anterior eth- moidal hole. The ocular artery aMo sends off' the infra troclilear branch, and the superciliary and palpebral branches, and anastomoses with the nasal branch of the facial artery. 1 he trunk ol the artery then ascends, and passes through the foramen supra orbitarium, or foramina supra orbitaria; and has thence been called the Frontal Artery or Frontal Ar- teries, which are distributed upon the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle; and communicate with the anterior branches of the superficial temporal artery. Of the Corresponding Veins. 1 he veins of the choroid coat follow a singular course. The smaller branches describe segments of a circle, which, by their union, form a trunk which passes through the sclerotic trunk. These veins, corresponding with the branches of the ocular artery above named, form the large ophthalmic vein, which communicates, at the inner angle of the eye, with the nasal and facial veins. The ophthalmic vein follows a tortuous course over the op- tic nerve, and passes backwards through the foramen lacerum into the cavernous sinus. Considering that the trunk of the ocular artery is about the size of a surgeonâ€™s common probe, it is remarkable how little blood is discharged from that artery, when the eye-ball bas been extirpated, on account of cancer or fungus hae- matodes. Slight pressure is sufficient to stem the flow of blood.

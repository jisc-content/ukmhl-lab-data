77 MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. ties called ventricles of the larynx, and then forms a second fold, which bounds the ventricles below; and it also lines the vocal chords, and afterwards the trachea and its branches. Of the Muscles of the Larynx. The larynx is moved as a whole by the muscles proper to other parts; and its component cartilages are also moved up- on each other, by muscles which are implanted upon it. The greater number of the muscles of the larynx are con- nected with the arytenoid cartilages, to which the vocal chords are fixed. If the thyroid cartilage be moved forwards by the crieo-thyroid muscles, and the two arytenoid cartilages be drawn backwards at the same time by the crico-arytenoid pos- tici, the vocal chords must be made tense ; and if, on the con- trary, the arytenoid cartilages be moved forwards by the thy- ro-arytenoidei, these chords will be relaxed. If the arytenoid cartilages be drawn outwards, or separated from each other by the crico-arytenoidei laterales, the space between the vocal chords called glottis will be made wider, or dilated ; and if, on the contrary, the arytenoid cartilages are drawn nearer to each other by the arytenoideus transversus, and the arytenoi- dei obliqui, the glottis will be constricted or shut. Arytenoideus Transversus. The fibres which constitute this muscle, are disposed trans- versely between the arytenoid cartilages, by which these car- tilages are drawn close to each other; and hence the glottis is shut. Arytenoidei Obliqui. The arytenoidei obliqui extend from the base of one of the arytenoid cartilages to the point of the other; and the fibres of these muscles decussate each other like the strokes of the letter X. These muscles are subservient to the same purpose as the preceding. Crico-Arytenoidei Laterales. These muscles take their origins from the sides of the cri-

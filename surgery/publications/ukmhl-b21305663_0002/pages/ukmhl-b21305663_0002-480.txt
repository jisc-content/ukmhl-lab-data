ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 484 Of the Supercilia or Eye-brows. The eye-brows are arched eminences, covered by iiair, ex- tending from the root of the nose to the temples, and which differ much in thickness and breadth in different persons. In a few cases, the arches forming the eye-brows meet at the root of the nose. The eye-brow consists of a thick doubling of skin, covered by hairs of different lengths, which vary in number and co- lour, and which are placed obliquely ; and fat; of part of the orbicularis, frontal, and corrugator supercilii muscles, and of bloodvessels and nerves. The hairs of the supercilia are disposed downwards and outwards, in order to prevent the sweat from getting into the eye-ball. The eye-brows are raised by the occipito-frontalis; drawn inwards or towards the nose by the corrugator supercilii; and somewhat depressed by the orbicularis palpebrarum muscles. The eye-brows assist very materially in expressing the various passions of the mind; defend the eye-balls from external in- jury ; prevent the sweat from the fore-head from running in- to the eye-ball; and, by contracting, protect the eye-ball from too vivid a light. Fronto-Superciliaris or Corrugator Supercilii. This muscle arises from the internal angular process of the os frontis, and is fixed behind the occipito-frontalis muscle in- to the middle of the superciliary ridge. By this muscle, the eye-brow is drawn downwards and inwards, by which the skin between the muscles of the opposite sides is thrown into lon- gitudinal folds. OF THE ORGANS BY WHICH THE TEARS ARE SECRETED, AND OF THE PASSAGES BY WHICH THE TEARS ARE CONVEYED TO THE EYE-BALL, AND FROM IT INTO THE NOSE. Of the Lacrymal Gland, and its Ducts. The lacrymal gland is of a yellow colour, somewhat flat- tened, nearly an inch long, and about half an inch broad.

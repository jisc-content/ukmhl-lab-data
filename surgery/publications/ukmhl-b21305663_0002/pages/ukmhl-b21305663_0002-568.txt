ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 323 scalenus muscle, and in its progress receives a branch from the fifth cervical: it enters the chest, between the subclavian artery and vein; passes along the root of the lungs, and then along the pericardium, and ultimately divides into a number of branches, which are distributed upon the diaphragm. The ultimate branches of this nerve are spent upon the ab- dominal surface of the diaphragm; and Petit has remarked, in his edition of Palfynâ€™s Anatomy, that they communicate with the small branches of the splanchnic and intercostal nerves. The phrenic nerve of the right side follows nearly a straight course, but that of the left side describes a considerable sweep, corresponding with that part of the pericardium which is op- posed to the apex of the heart. From the immediate conjunction of the nerves, which con- cur in forming the phrenic nerve, the symptoms attending that remarkable disease, called Risus Sardonicus, may per- haps be explained. The third pair of cervical nerves is joined with the auricu- lar branches of the seventh pair. The rest of the portio dura is spent upon the muscles of the face; a part of it communi- cates with the second branch of the fifth pair, and also with the third branch of the fifth pair. My colleague Dr Graham sent to the Museum a speci- men, taken from the body of a woman who had laboured un- der severe cough and difficult breathing. The lungs were found quite sound, but the spinal canal was found much contracted at its upper part, the tooth process of the second vertebra being much enlarged ; hence it seemed probable, that the pressure on the spinal cord, above the phrenic nerve, had been the cause of the difficulty in breathing, and death of the patient, in the same manner as the fracture and dis- placement of the cervical vertebrae above the third and fourth cervical vertebrae generally proves a cause of instant death, the diaphragm being thereby paralysed, and incapable of con- tinuing respiration.

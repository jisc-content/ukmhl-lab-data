The bony brim of the pelvis, and sometimes the psoae muscles, make an impression on the womb. The ovum consists of the membranes which contain the foetus and liquor amnii. At this early period, there is no um- bilical cord; the foetus adheres to its membranes. There are four membranes in the earlier months, the am- nion, chorion, decidua, and decidua rejiexa. The two former are proper to the foetus; in proof of which, when the foetus is lodged in the Fallopian tube, it is enveloped in these mem- branes, and the two latter to the womb. A part of the decidua is reflected, forming the fourth co- vering. Dr Hunter has particularly described this reflec- tion. The foetus passes into the uterus, inclosed within the am- mon and chorion, which has a great number of shaggy ves- sels upon it. The chorion is considerably thicker in the earlier than in the more advanced stages of pregnancy, and is covered by flocculi of different lengths and thicknesses, which in a short time disappear, excepting in the upper part, where they con- tribute to form the placenta. Between the chorion and amnion, which cover the umbili-

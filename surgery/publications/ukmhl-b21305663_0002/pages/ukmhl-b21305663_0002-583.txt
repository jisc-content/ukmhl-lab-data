OF THE LUWBAlt NERVES. 537 raina of the os sacrum, and terminate upon the surface of the ossa coccygis, when they are united by a transverse nerve. The sympathetic nerve forms ganglia with the lumbar nerves; and, in the pelvis, it also forms ganglia, which are connected to the sacral nerves. The sympathetic nerves, during their course to the ossa coccygis, are united with the lumbar and sacral nerves by ganglia. Small nerves take their rise from the sympathetic, in its progress through the pelvis, which are spent upon the coccygeus muscle, and upon the lower share of the intestinum rectum. Of the Lumbar Nerves. The five lumbar nerves are connected with the sympathe- tic nerves, and with each other ; and, from the lumbar plexus, behind the psoas muscle/ nerves are derived, which sup- ply the fore-part of the inferior extremity. The plexus of lumbar nerves is formed by a branch from the last dorsal nerve, and by the four uppermost lumbar nerves. The anterior branches only form the plexus; for the posterior go to the back. The external spermatic nerves are derived from the upper part of this plexus: it passes to the anterior superior spinous process of the os ilium ; creeps along the posterior surface of Poupartâ€™s ligament, and reaches the spermatic cord, at the upper abdominal aperture, and it is spent on the spermatic cord and scrotum ; or, in the female, having passed along the round ligament, it at length is spent on the labia pudendi. The first pair of Lumbar Nerves is connected with the twelfth dorsal, and with the second lumbar. This pair of nerves furnishes branches to the muscles of the loins, scrotum, and to the muscles of the upper parts of the thighs. The second pair of Lumbar Nerves perforates the psoas muscles, to which it gives branches; and detaches also the spermatic nerve, which descends along the spermatic vessels; and, above the upper abdominal aperture, divides into two branches, one of which is distributed upon the pubes, scro-

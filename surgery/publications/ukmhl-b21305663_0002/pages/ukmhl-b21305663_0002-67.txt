41 OF THE ARTERIES. the passage between the pulmonary artery and aorta is open in the adult. Morgagni has made mention of his having met with a com- munication between the ventricles of the heart. In the three last instances, the blood was imperfectly oxi- dated. SECTION IX. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE ARTERIES. The arteries are those tubes connected with the heart, by which the blood is distributed to different parts of the body. The arteries, during life, are distinguished (the pulmonary artery excepted), by the florid colour of the blood they con- tain ; by their pulsatory motion; and by the course of the stream of blood. After death, they are distinguished by their thick whitish coats, by having no valves, excepting at their origin from the heart; and, owing to the elasticity of their coats, presenting, when cut through, a circular orifice. Of the Disposition of the Arteries. By the arteries, which are elastic and muscular tubes, the blood flows to the different parts of the body; and by the Teins it flows backwards: the heart is the machine which assists in propelling the blood, and which is placed where the arteries and veins meet, in order, by its action, to restore to the blood the momentum it had lost during the circulation. The blood, in passing outwards, flows from wider into nar- rower tubes; and, in returning, from narrower into wider ves- sels. The arterial system has been compared to a cone, of which the apex is at the heart; but an individual artery cannot be compared to a cone; the common carotid or vertebral arteries, for instance, are cylindrical tubes. The larger trunks of the arteries are included in a considerable quantity of cellular sub-

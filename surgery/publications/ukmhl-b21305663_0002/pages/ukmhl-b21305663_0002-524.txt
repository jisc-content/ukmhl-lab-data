ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 47S vated or abraded from the surface of the intestines by dis- ease. The cuticle is less prone to putrefaction than any other parts of the body, and may be taken off from the hand of a body that has become putrid, like a glove. The bloodvessels of the cuticle are so small that a red in- jection cannot be thrown into them. When it is detached from the subjacent true skin, a num- ber of threads may be observed passing into it; hence it is nourished by these vessels. It has been supposed, that when the skin has been irritated by a blister, a part of the fluid is derived from the vessels of the cuticle. Of the Chemical Analysis of the Cuticle. The cuticle, according to Mr Hatchett, bears a very strong resemblance to jelly. Cuticle burns like horn when thrown into the fire, and gives out a similar smell. By means of nitric acid the cuticle becomes thicker, assumes a lemon colour, and, if the acid be applied for twenty-four hours, it is converted into a pulp. The sulphuric acid gives to the cuticle a brown colour; it renders it somewhat like glue both in colour and consistence. The caustic alkalies dissolve the cuticle, and form with ii a substance somewhat like soap. Of the Nails. The nails constitute a part of the cuticle ; they are concave internally, and convex externally; are neai'ly transparent, and hence have a reddish colour, from the colour of the skin shining under them. The nails are composed of layers, which arc made up of fibres, and the longest fibres of the nails are outermost; there- fore the nails are thinnest at their edges : like horn and cuti- cle, they are insensible, except where they adhere to the skin. The nails are said to be fixed by their roots by a semilu- nar fold of skin. The term root is, however objectionable, as

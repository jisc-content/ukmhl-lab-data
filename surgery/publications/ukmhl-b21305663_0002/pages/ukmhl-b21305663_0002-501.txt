OF THE COCHLEA. 455 the very minute ramifications of the portio mollis, which form a very intricate network *, are distributed. There are three canals, which describe the greater part of a circle, and which communicate with the vestible. These canals, according to my Father, are, in the skate, cir- cular ; and a smaller membranous canal is included within a considerably larger cartilaginous canal; a circumstance which has been fully described and represented by my Father in his book on Fishes, and which probably paved the way to the discovery of Professor Scarpa +, who found a similar struc- ture in man; but the distance between the membranous and osseous pari of the semicircular canals in man, is by no means so great as in the skate. One of the semicircular canals is called Superior, from its situation, and the two others are called, from their di- rection, the Oblique and Horizontal. There are only five aper- tures bv which these canals communicate with the vestible, for two of them have a common termination. These canals are not of an uniform caliber ; they are en- larged at their union with the vestible; and form what ana- tomists have called their Ampullula. Of the Cochlea. This remarkable part of the ear, is differently constructed in different animals, and fishes are destitute of it. In birds, it consists of a tube divided into two parts by a membranous partition. In the Cete physeter, according to my Father, the cochlea is larger than in man ; but the semi- circular canals are smaller. In the bat, the cochlea is very large, and forms a projec- tion under the base of the cranium. In the human body, it is very complex in its structure.

OF THE CORNEA. 395 appearance seen, of its fibres passing forwards over the cor- nea. In the next place, if the tendons of the recti muscles had terminated, partly in the external layer of the cornea, in such a manner, as to affect it chiefly, they should, by pulling the whole external layer of the cornea backwards, have flattened the cornea, instead of rendering it more convex. On the inner side of the sclerotic coat there is a thin mem- brane, of a delicate texture, and of a light brown colour, up- on which there are a number of bloodvessels, and which is fixed by a number of processes to the sclerotic coat. The sclerotic coat, on account of its density and strength, is well calculated for determining the shape of the eye, and for supporting and defending the more essential and delicate parts of that organ. Of the Cornea. The cornea forms the anterior transparent portion of the eye-ball. In fishes and the cetacea, the anterior part of the eve is flat, but in birds remarkably convex. It is more or less convex, and there is great variety in this respect, in different individuals. In the foetus it is rather more prominent than in the adult. When the cornea is too convex, the rays of light are col- lected into a focus before the retina, and such persons are short-sighted ; but, on the other hand, when the cornea is flat- ter than common, the foci of rays, proceeding from near ob- jects, are formed beyond the retina, and such persons are long-sighted, and can only see objects held at a considerable distance from the eve. It sometimes happens, that, in the same individual, there is a difference in the convexity of the cornea in the two eyes; thus, a medical gentleman informed me, that one of his eyes acted like a telescope, and the other like a microscope. The cornea possesses a considerable share of elasticity, but is not so extensible as the sclerotic coat. The cornea is internally nearly circular, and composed of

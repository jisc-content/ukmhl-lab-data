OF THE INTEROSSEOUS ARTERIES. 263 terossea posterior, as it perforates the upper part of the interosseous ligament. From this artery, there is also a recur- rent branch, which is reflected along the supinator radii bre- vis and anconeus muscles, and anastomoses with several small branches of the humeral artery, on the back part of the elbow- joint. The posterior interosseous artery is continued downwards to the back part of the fore-arm, and its smaller branches sup- ply the extensor muscles of the fingers, and the posterior part of the ligament at the wrist. The interossea anterior is sent off below the posterior, under the long flexor of the thumb, and is considerably larger than it From this artery there are small branches sent to the pronator teres and supinator radii brevis. This artery passes downwards along the fore-part of the interosseous ligament, and supplies the flexor digitorum pro- fundus with blood. A little above the wrist, this artery perforates the interos- seous ligament, below the pronator radii quadratus, to which it gives small branches, and also branches to the ligaments and tendons of the posterior part of the wrist, and anasto- moses with the smaller branches of the posterior interosseous artery and of the radial artery. At the carpal extremity of the ulna, a small branch is sent off from the ulnar artery, which passes behind the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris to the back of the hand, and, unit- ing with the smaller branches of the radial artery, forms a plexus of vessels on the back part of the wrist, hand, and fin- gers. The ulnar artery then sends off many small branches, which supply the fore-part of the wrist; and, passing over the annu- lar ligament, form the superficial palmar arch, which extends between the root of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, near to the first bone of the thumb. The following branches are sent off from the palmar arch : three digital branches which run in the interstices of the me- tacarpal bones to the loots of the fingers; each is subdivided into two branches; one of these runs along the radial margin, and the other along the ulnar margin of the finger : all the

335 OF GANGLIA OF NERVES. The nerves, in their course, are united by plexuses, in which the fibres of the different nerves are intermixed, and every nerve under the plexus consists of all the nerves which entered the plexus. Some of the nerves which run in opposite directions are connected by small branches; as the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, with the portio dura of the auditory nerves. In the ox, my Father remarked, that the small branches which come off beyond the union of the two larger nerves, consist of the fibres of both. In the whole nervous system, the particular cords, of which die particular nerves consist, form, according to my Father *, '.within their proper sheaths, a succession of plexuses, in which their fibres are intermixed and combined again. Thus the danger of diseases and injuries of the trunks of the nerves is materially diminished. Of Ganglia of Nerves. A particular nerve is expanded at a certain place or places, which expansion has been called a Ganglion. There are communications between a number of nerves; and where these communications take place, there is an en- largement or ganglion. These ganglia have been very particularly described by my Father, and after him by Scarpa, and their descriptions a- gree in almost every particular. "Weber and Lobstein, still more lately have described ganglia of the sympathetic nerve very particularly. There are some single nerves, which are enlarged, so as to form a ganglion, and the nerve is afterwards contracted. The ganglia are covered by a fibrous membrane. The ganglia are little flattened bodies, connected with the nerves, consisting chiefly of medullary matter; and these gan- glia are different in size and shape in different nerves, and even in the same nerve, as in the sympathetic. All ganglia seem to be similar in their structure. * Vide Nervous System, p. 44.

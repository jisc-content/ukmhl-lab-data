ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 282 Ihc liver, which was taken from a person nineteen years of age, weighed only twenty ounces. 1 wo umbilical veins, each of them as large as the umbili- cal vein of a child at birth, were found running from the na- vel to the liver, near to which they joined, and formed one vein as large as the finger, which terminated in the left branch of the vena portae. On the outer side of the umbilical ring, the umbilical veins, communicated by large canals, with the subcutaneous veins, and with the epigastric veins, and so with the iliacae com- munes veins. For some time before death, the subcutaneous veins of the abdomen were much enlarged, and the patient had daily bloody stools. Of the Renal Arteries. These large arteries come off at right angles from the ab- dominal aorta, between the superior and inferior mesenteric artex'ies; and, in proportion to the organs on which they are distributed, they are of very considerable size. The branches of the renal arteries are not of the same length ; the right is the longer, and passes behind the vena cava. The renal arteries divide, before entering into the substance of the kidneys, into three or four large branches, which in- close the pelvis of this organ. These branches form arches, from which innumerable small branches are sent off to the outer or cortical part of the kidney. In a former part of this work, I have described the more minute branches of these arteries. The renal arteries send small branches to the fat that sur- rounds them, and to the renal glands. The veins of the kid- ney carry the blood back to the vena cava inferior. In some instances, the arteries of the renal capsule come off from the aorta, but in others, from the renal artery. Of the Spermatic Arteries and Veins. The spermatic arteries generally take theirrisefrom the aorta, a little below the renal arteries; and sometimes from the renal arteries. They are about the size of a surgeonâ€™s probe,

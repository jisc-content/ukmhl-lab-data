118 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY'. CHAP. III. OF SECRETION. The term Gland lias been applied to those organs bv which such fluids are separated from the body as are necessary to the varied functions of the animal economy, or are hurtful or useless to it. The apparatus by which secretion is accomplished is of a more simple or a more complicated nature. Various fluids, totally different from the blood, are derived from the branches of the arteries called Exhalant; these mav be called glands of the most simple construction : and other fluids are derived from follicular organs or glands, which are of a much more complicated construction, being composed of several lobes, united by cellular substance : these have pro- per bloodvessels, nerves, absorbents, and excretory ducts ; these glands are very different from each other in many re- spects. Exhalation takes place upon the surface of the body, and also within its cavities, as upon the serous, mucous, and cel- lular membranes. The nature of the exhaled fluid is by no means uniform ; generally it is of a watery nature ; as, for instance, the serous fluid, which is found on the surfaces of the pleurae, perito- naeum, synovial membranes of the joints, and in the cellular membrane. Fat is also probably derived from the exhaling branches of the arteries. Some glands are single, as the liver and pancreas, others are double, as the kidneys and lacrymal gland ; and glands of this description are very various in point of size. The arteries proper to the different glands arc very differ-

526 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. cles in the vicinity of the spine, the intercostal muscles, and also those of the abdomen. The superior intercostal nerves supply by their branches the upper and outer part of the chest and the mammae. The lower intercostals supply the muscles of the thorax and of the abdomen. After the intercostal nerves have passed between the verte- brae, they are connected with the great sympathetic nerve, and form ganglia. Mercury, according to Mr Swan *, affects very much the ganglion of the sympathetic nerve. He gave a dog mercury for some time; he killed him, and found “ all the ganglion of the grand sympathetic nerves were very much inflamed, and especially the superior cervical. “ May not,” says my Grandfather, “ the communications of all these nerves be one reason why the parts act so uni- formly and conjunctly in respiration, and conspire together in the convulsive motions of coughing, sneezing, and the twitching spasms that happen sometimes in different parts of the muscles of the abdomen, by an irritation on the lower dorsal nerves, are in danger of occasioning a mistake in prac- tice, by their resemblance to colic, nephritis, &c. The com- munications of these lower ones with the intercostals, may serve to explain the violent effort of the abdominal muscles in a tenesmus, and child-bearing.” From these ganglia branches are derived which supply the extensor muscles of the body. The trunk of the intercostal nerve enters into the axillary plexus, and a branch from it runs along the edge of the first rib. The intercostal nerves, in their progress along the grooves of the ribs, give nerves to the intercostal muscles, and to the serratus magnus, even to the skin of the thorax, and to the upper part of the abdominal muscles. There are also branches of the intercostal nerves which are • Vide his Inquiry into the Action of Mercury, p. 81.

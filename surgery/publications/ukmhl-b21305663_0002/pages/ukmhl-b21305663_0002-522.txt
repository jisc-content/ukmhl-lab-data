ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 476 or clitoris, there the sense of touch is very acute; and, on the other hand, where it is thick and hard, there the sense of touch is obtuse. The internal surface of the cuticle is of a greyish green co- lour. When moisture is applied to the cuticle, it assumes a white opake hue. The cuticle is in a constant state of change, and is detached in dry, branny, small, and thin scales, which may be seen sticking to the inner surface of black silk stockings. The sur- face of the cuticle, in these circumstances, is uneven; and these scales may be detached by hard rubbing: indeed, by long continued hard rubbing, the whole cuticle is worn down. The cuticle of many animals comes off at certain seasons. From serpents and caterpillars it comes off as an entire sheath. The cuticle possesses a considerable share of flexibility, by which it readily adapts itself to the form of the parts with which it is connected. The cuticle is not so elastic as the true skin, and it does not entirely regain its original size after great extension, and cannot be extended to a considerable degree without cracking or tearing, as generally happens when tumours are situated under the skin. When moisture is applied to the cuticle, as when a poul- tice is put on, it assumes an unnatural whiteness and opacity, and is thrown into wi'inkles. The nerves of the cuticle are not visible; it possesses no degree of sensibility, it may be cut or punctured without giving pain. The cuticle is perforated by the exhalant branches of the arteries, by absorbent vessels, and by hairs. It is still a matter of doubt, whether or not the vessels of insensible perspiration be the same as those of sweat. The analogy of the dog, who perspires but does not sweat, affords an argument in favour of the matter of sweat and perspira- tion beine derived from a different set of vessels. There have been some anatomists who have considered the cuticle as porous : upon this opinion my Grandfather has ob-

510 ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. membranes of the spinal cord which I have seen, was that of a person who had laboured under tetanus for several days. In consequence of inflammation, purulent matter is often found between the spinal cord and its membrane. There is also sometimes a serous effusion between the mem- branes of the spinal cord. Several instances have been described, of a loss of a part of the spinal cord, by Desault *, Copland, Rullier -f- and Olivier j. What is remarkable, one of the patients retained the feel- ing and power of motion of the inferior extremities; and, in a similar case related by Bayle, the patient was afflicted by frequent lancinating pain. Of the Nerves of the NecJc. The sub-occipital nerves take their rise from the beginning of the spinal marrow, by an anterior and posterior fasciculus. These nerves perforate the dura mater under the entrance of the vertebral artery, and pass over the transverse process of the atlas. These nerves, after their exit from the spinal canal, are connected with the ninth pair, and with the first cervical nerve; and their branches are distributed upon the recti and oblique muscles of the head; and before, they are connected by two or three small filaments from the uppermost ganglion of the sympathetic nerve. The first cervical nerve passes out between the first and second vertebra of the neck, and divides into two large branches. The one is spent on the extensor muscles of the head and neck, and then ascends upon the occiput, dividing into many branches, which are distributed upon the back- part of the head. The other branch, is united with the acces- sory nerve, the ninth pair of nerves, and uppermost ganglion of the sympathetic nerve, from which a nerve is sent down- wards to the second cervical ganglion. • Journal de Chirurg. tom. iv.

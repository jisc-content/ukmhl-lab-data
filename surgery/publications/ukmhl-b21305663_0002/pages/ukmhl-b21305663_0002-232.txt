ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 194. When the gland is divided, it is found, internally, to be of a spongy consistence. It tears readily in the direction in which it is cut; and I suspect is frequently lacerated during the performance of the lateral operation of Lithotomy, espe- cially when a large stone is extracted from the bladder. Mr Deschamps of Paris, made many experiments on this gland ; and discovei'ed, that if the point of this gland, the most resisting part of it, be cut to the depth of three lines, and then slowly and cautiously dilated, a stone 8 lines in dia- meter may be extracted without laceration of the neck of the bladder, or of the rest of the prostate gland, which, he says, is more dilatable than the membranous part of the urethra; that, in an adult, if the incision be 6 lines deep, a stone 14 or 15 lines in diameter, maybe extracted; if the incision is 8 lines deep, a stone 18 or 19 lines in diameter, and weighing about 4 ounces, may, without laceration, be taken out; but a stone above this size will require the incision of the whole depth of the prostate gland, at its uppermost thickest part, which measures about 9 lines. These experiments have dis- tinctly proved, that a stone of considerable bulk may be ex- tracted by the lateral method of cutting for the stone. Of the D ucts of the Prostate Gland. My Father, soon after he began to lecture in this Univer- sity, directed his attention to the structure of this gland ; and discovered, after very successful injections of the ducts, â€œ that although this gland secretes a whitish mucous liquor, it is not lodged in follicles, as Bidloo and Cowpeh have repre- sented, but that the whole gland is composed of cylindrical ducts, the beginnings of which are so small as to escape the observation of the naked eye. The ducts, by their convolu- tions, form small lobules; and from each lobule ducts not larger than the hairs in the tail of a horse come out; and these, in their course towards the urethra, join together in the same way as the ducts of the salivary glands, or those of the mamma. The ducts of the prostate gland are frequently much en- larged, when the urethra has been constricted, which proves

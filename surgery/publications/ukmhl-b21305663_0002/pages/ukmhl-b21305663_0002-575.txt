OF THE NERVES OF THE VISCERA. 529 direct experiment, found subjected to every part of the brain and spinal marrow. Of the Nerves of the Chylopoetic and Assistant Chylopoetic Viscera. The nerves of the chylopoetic, and assistant chylopeetic viscera, are derived from the sympathetic nerve; the par va- gum of the eighth pair of nerves ; and the rami splanchnici. The Rami Splanchnici arise from the sympathetic nerves; they pass through the upper and lateral parts of the smaller diaphragm, and join the greater semilunar ganglion, formed by the conjoined eighth pairs of nerves and ramini splanch- nici. The par vagcjm of the left side having passed along the gullet, gets to the fore-part of the upper orifice of the sto- mach, and divides into a number of small nerves, which are distributed on the upper surface of the stomach ; and a few filaments from this nerve join the left hepatic plexus. The par vagum of the right side, situated upon the back part of the stomach, divides into two plexuses; one of which joins the hepatic plexus; the other is distributed upon the great left sac of the stomach. The semilunar solar ganglion *, formed by the paria vaga and the rami splanchnici, is of an irregular form, having its curved edge downwards, and is composed of several smal- ler ganglia, called Cceliac, which vary in size. This ganglion lies on the crus of the diaphragm, and on the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. It is formed of a series of small ganglia, united to each other by condensed cellular substance. From, this ganglion, called the semilunar solar, nerves are derived, which accompany the cceliac artery and its branches. Lobstein has described and represented in his Plate X., bodies above the size of small peas, which are connected with the semilunar solar ganglion. â€¢ Vide Walteri Tab. Nerv. VOL. II. 1.1

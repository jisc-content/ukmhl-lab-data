ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 88 who cough up this black matter, the lungs are of a black co- lour throughout all their cells. So that it may not seem im- probable that some of this black matter passes into the cells, and gives colour to the mucus. Further, though I observe bronchial glands deeper in the lungs, or farther from the trachea, than they are generally described to be, yet, I have not observed them in the distant part of the lungs; but on examining the contents of the most distant, and smallest branchesof the trachea, I have found them tinged with black matter ; but we cannot well suppose that this black matter, is tenacious and viscid, which is carried so far backwards from the large to the small branches of the trachea. We would rather believe, that anatomists have hitherto over- looked the true cause of the dark colour of the mucus and of the bronchial glands ; in the first place, from their not obser- ving that the lymphatic vessels pass through the bronchial glands; and, in the next place, from their not considering the lymphatics as the absorbent vessels of the lungs: and that the true cause of the blackness of the mucus, and of the glands, is not to be sought for, from any particular mechanism of these glands; but that this black matter is thrown into the cavity of the trachea and cells of the lungs, as well as into the interstices of all the fibres of the lungs; and that hence the mucus within the trachea directly receives its colour ; and again, that the lymphatic absorbents of the lungs, carry it from the substance of the lungs into the lymphatic bronchial glands. And to give convincing proof that this explanation, which occurred to me from the time I knew the bronchial glands to belong to the lymphatic system, is the true one, we may ob- serve farther, that the colour of the bronchial glands always corresponds with that of the lungs. In children, where the lungs are brown, tbev are brown likewise. O In old subjects I have very often observed lymphatic elands, at a great distance from the trachea, as in the medias- tinum, and on the pericardium, of the same black colour ; yet there was no reason to suppose these performed any secretion, or in any way communicated with the trachea; and, in some subjects, I have seen this black colour in the lymphatic

544 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. “ 5. When the third nerves are similarly irritated in the living or dead bird, a like result ensues. “ 6. When the fifth nerve is similarly irritated in the dead bird, no affection of the pupil is observed. “ 7. When the optic nerves have been divided within the cranial cavity of a pigeon immediately after its decapitation, if the portion of the nerves attached to the eyes be pinched, no contraction of the pupil ensues : if the portion adhering to the brain be pinched, a like contraction of the pupil ensues, as if the optic nerves had not been divided. “ 8. The previous division of the fifth nerves in the pre- ceding experiment produces no difference in the result. “ 9. When the third nerves have been divided in the cra- nial cavity of the living or the dead bird, no change in the pupil ensues on irritating the entire or divided optic nerves. « It may be inferred from the preceding induction, that diminution of the pupil results from the action, and dilatation of the pupil from relaxation of the iris ; that the nerve which immediately controuls the action of the iris is the third nerve ; that, in the habitual variations of the pupil, an impression is conveyed to the brain along the optic nerve, which is followed by an affection of the third pair, causing the pupil to contract or to dilate; finally, that the common feeling of the eye is derived from the fifth nerve.”

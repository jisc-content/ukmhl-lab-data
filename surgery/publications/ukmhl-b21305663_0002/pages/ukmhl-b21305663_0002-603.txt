555 OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. When the coats of the lymphatic vessels have been irritated, they become thick and hard, and appear as red lines upon the skin, which is probably owing to the inflammation and induration of the cellular membrane. There are many small vessels proper to the coats of the ab- sorbent vessels, which are of such a size as to admit the red globules of the blood, or the powder of vermilion : these are the vasa vasorum of the lymphatic vessels. Many of the lymphatic vessels lie in immediate contact with the nerves; but these nerves, on account of their extremely small size, cannot be traced upon the coats of the lymphatic vessels. Of the Valves. The lymphatic vessels have numerous valves, which general- ly are disposed in pairs. The valve is of a parabolic or semicircular form, con- nected with the inner coat of the vessel by its circular edge, and having its straight edge corresponding with the opposite valve loose in the cavity. In some of the lymphatic vessels, the valves are disposed at uuiform distances from each other, commonly about the distance of half an inch from each other, as in the spermatic cord, and in the lacteal vessels ; but in others, they are dis- posed very irregularly, and in the great trunk of the lymphatic system, the thoracic duct, there are very few pairs of valves. It is remarkable, that, in some instances, a few valves only are found in the trunk of a lymphatic vessel; while a num- ber of pairs of valves are found in its branches. The valves generally perform their office with great accu- racy, so as even after death to support a considerable column of quicksilver. In filling them, the liquor must be thrown in according to the course of the lymph ; I recollect of having heard of one instance only in the human subject, and that oc- curred to Dr William Hunter of London, in which a li- quor could be forced through the lymphatic vessels of the ex- tremities, in a direction contrary to the usual current of the lymph.

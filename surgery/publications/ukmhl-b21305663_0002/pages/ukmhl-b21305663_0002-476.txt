ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 430 Of the Caruncula Lacrymalis. The caruncula lacrymalis is an oblong body, of a red co- lour, situated in the internal angle of the eye. It has constantly a polished surface, from which we may observe frequently two or three hairs growing. This substance secretes a whitish mucous fluid. MUSCLES OF THE EYE-LIDS. Naso-palpebralis, or Orbicularis Palpebrarum. The fibres of the orbicular muscle are arranged parallel to the edge of the eyelid; and the fibres of the muscle are con- centric. This muscle arises by a tendon, from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, from the orbitar process of the same bone, and from the internal angular process of the os frontis; its fibres are intermixed with those of the frontal and corrugator, and levator labii superioris muscles, and the outer surface of the muscle adheres to the skin of the eyelids. The fibres of this muscle decussate each other at the exter- nal angle of the eye. The upper eye-lid is raised by volition, but it is carried down, almost involuntarily; for we cannot suspend the motion for a long time. The under eye-lid is raised by the action of this muscle. My Father has concluded, from his experiments, that the orbicularis of the eye-lid, by its pressure on the upper and tin- der part of the cornea, renders it flatter; by which the mid- dle part of the cornea is protruded between the edges of the eye-lids, so as to render the cornea more convex, and, at the same time, to increase the distance of the cornea from the lens, or to lengthen the axis of the eye-ball. Orbito-Palpebralis, or Attollens Palpebram Superiorem. The attollens palpebram superiorem is a long thin muscle, placed immediately under the orbitar process of the frontal

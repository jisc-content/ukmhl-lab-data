ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. in the whole gills there are 144,000 subdivisions or folds, the two sides of each of which are equal to the sixty-fourth part of a square inch, or the surface of the whole gills in a large skate is equal to 2250 square inches, that is to more than fifteen square feet, which have been supposed to be equal to the whole external surface of the human body. When, after a good injection of the artery, a microscope is applied, the whole extent of the membrane of the gills is seen covered with a beautiful net-work of exceedingly minute vessels. As fishes taint the water they respire, in nearly the same manner as we taint the air we breathe, it appears that some matter, either useful or hurtful, or both, is absorbed or car- ried off from their blood, as it passes through their gills. As in many fishes there is a soft spongy organ within the air-bag, by which the elastic air seems to be separated from the other humours of the animal; so in our lungs, the branches of the pulmonary artery separate the air which has been fixed in our blood, and which, probably by some change it under- goes there, begins to be hurtful, and is therefore discharged. Having explained all that relates to the air-vessels of the lungs, we are next to examine the circulating system, begin- ing with the chief system called Pulmonary. The pulmonary artery takes its rise from the upper part of the anterior ven- tricle of the heart; it is soon divided into tvro great branches, which supply the right and left lungs, and these are again subdivided into innumerable branches, which are distributed through every part of the lungs, and which compose an intimate net-work on the cells of the lungs. The coats of the pulmonary artery are thinner and more pliable than those <;f the aorta. Though the pulmonary veins are smaller in proportion to the corresponding branches of the artery, than branches of veins are in other parts of the body, yet we will neither find this fact so important as it is supposed, nor have reason to adopt the explanation of the purposes it has been supposed to serve. The size of the branches of the pulmonary artery cor- responds with the greater size of the parts on the right side of

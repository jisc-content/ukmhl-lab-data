OF THE LABIA INTERNA. 225 Hortentots and Bosjesman females they sometimes equal four or five inches in length. This elongation proves a source of great inconvenience; and, according to Niebuhr * * * §, has led to the practice of cut- ting off the greater part of it. I received some time ago, from a friend, a drawing of the nymphae of a female Hottentot, which was made by that excellent artist Mr Daniel, during his residence at the Cape of Good Hope, from which it is evident, that the de- scription given of those by Vaillant, who considers them to be elongations of the labia externa, is quite incorrect. Mr Barrow -f* and Dr Sommeiiville j bear testimony to the above fact; and, according to these authors, the great size of the nymphae is congenite, and they are of an extraordinary size even in the children of the Bosjesman. The large nymphae of the female who shewed herself in London, Edinburgh and Paris, under the name of the Hot- tentot Venus, who, to use the phrase of Cuvier, had “ la complaisance de se depouiller,” were not seen during her life, for “ elle tint son tablier (enlarged nymphae) soigneusement cache, soit entre ses cuisses, soit plus profondement, et ce n’est qu’apres sa mort qu’on a su qu’elle le possedoit.” The other external parts of generation of the female Hot- tentot do not bear a proportional size to the nymphae, for the mons veneris and labia are smaller than in most European wo- men, which was most distinctly shewn by Mr Daniel in his drawing, and is confirmed by the observations of that acute observer Dr Sommerville. This uncommon size of the nymphae is not peculiar to the natives of Southern Africa; it exists among the Moors § and Copts, who, to get rid of the inconvenience, perform circumci- sion on the girls. * Vide Travels, vol, ii. p. 250. + Vide Travels into the Interior of Africa.

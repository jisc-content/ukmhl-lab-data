234- elements OF ANATOMY. The origin of the Pulmonary Artery, and its course, have been already described *. This artery divides into two great branches, called right and left, as they are distributed upon the right and left lungs. They are unequal in size and length, the former being the larger, and also the longer. These branches are subdivided into a number of very small branches, which are distributed along with the smaller branches of the air-tubes; and they ultimately form a net-work upon the air-cells of the lungs. These arteries freely communicate with the bronchias. The pulmonary artery is bv no means so liable to disease as the aorta; and though it is included in the same sheath, I have never seen a communication established between these, by disease. An aneurism, in the front of the aorta, bears a strong re- semblance to that of the pulmonary artery. Of the Pulmonary Veins. The Pulmonary Veins differ from those of other parts of the body, in being smaller than those of the corresponding artery. The pulmonary veins follow the same course as the arte- ries : but are rather smaller; and at length are united into four pulmonary veins, which terminate in the posterior auri- cle of the heart. Of the Aorta. The origin of the aorta, from the posterior ventricle of the heart, has been already described. This artery is placed be- hind the pulmonary artery, and is connected with it by the serous membrane of the pericardium. This great artery, immediately after its exit from the heart, is somewhat expanded, and about two inches of it are con- tained within the pericardium. The aorta arises from behind the pulmonary artery, and â€¢ YidC Page 37. of this Volume.

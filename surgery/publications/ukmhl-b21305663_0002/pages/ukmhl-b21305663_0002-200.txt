162 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Nearly opposite to the vena ipsius penis, we meet with an imperfect partition between the corpora cavernosa, which di- vides the penis longitudinally : it consists of a number of strong ligamentous cords, which are not in immediate contact; for there are spaces between them, through which any fluid passes readily from the one corpus cavernosum to the other. The corpora cavernosa when distended are rounded lateral- ly, and flattened in their upper and under surfaces; they are not of an uniform diameter, but arc rather smaller at each extremity than in the middle. I have lately examined, with considerable attention, the structure of the corpora cavernosa penis of man, and of the horse, and also that of the human spleen, and am disposed to think the structure of these organs similar. They consist of a congeries of arteries and veins, which form continuous canals, without the intervention of any cells. The best description given by any author, of the structure of the corpora cavernosa penis, occurs in the works cf Vesa- lius : he has observed, â€œ Corpora base (cavernosa) enata ad eum fere modum, ac si ex innumeris arteriarum venarumque fasciculis quam tenuissimis, simulque proxime implicatis, re- tia quaedam efformarentur orbiculatim a nervea ilia membra- neaque substantia comprehensa Of the Gians Penis. The glans penis, which forms the extremity of the penis, is somewhat like a cone in figure, the basis of which is sur- rounded by a prominent margin ; and at the apex, the orifice of the urethra is placed. The glans is covered by the prepuce, which defends it from being injured by friction. The prepuce is fixed to the glans by the fraenum, which is lodged in a groove in the un- der surface of the glans, which extends to the orifice of the urethra. The use of the fraenum is to prevent the prepuce from being drawn too much backwards; but if the fraenum be too short, * De Corpor. Human, fab. lib. v. cap. xiv.

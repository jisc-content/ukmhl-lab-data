392 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. outer side of which is oblique, but they appear situated deep- er towards the nose. The eye-ball is supported, as upon a cushion, by a quanti- ty of very fine fat; and it is kept in its place by the tunica conjunctiva, the muscles which move it, and the eyelids. In almost all animals, the eye-ball is somewhat of a round- ed form, but it is not in any one animal a perfect sphere. The human eye may be compared to two segments of a sphere, of which the fore-part, which is pellucid and more prominent, forms a portion of a smaller sphere than the pos- terior part. But in the inferior animals the eye-ball does not exactly re- semble that of man; it is proportionally broader, and in most birds the cornea is more convex than in the class Mammalia; whereas in the greater number of fishes and cetacea, the cor- nea is flat, the form of the cornea being adapted to the me- dium in which the animal lives. Of the Size of the Eye-Ball. There is much more variety as to the size of the eye-ball in different animals, and it does by no means bear a proportion- al size to the rest of the body ; as we observe in a child, whose eyes are proportionally larger than those of the adult; and in the elephant and whale, the size of the eye-ball is not pro- portioned to that of the rest of the body. The eye-ball of some animals is remarkably small; in the mole so much so, that it was for a long time disputed whether that animal had eyes or not. In general, it may be observed, that those animals that seek their prey during the night have large eyes. The eyes of birds are also large, and those of the class of fishes still more so. There are some men whose eyes are not exactly of the same size ; and, generally speaking, the eyes of the male are larger than those of the female. Of the Position of the Eye-Ball. The eye-balls of some animals are directed forwards, but those of other animals are directed backwards.

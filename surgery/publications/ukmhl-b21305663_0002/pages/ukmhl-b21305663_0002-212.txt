174 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. an instrument the urethra is sufficiently dilated ; and in the case of the operation of lithotomy, when this instrument is of the full size, the groove in the staff is more easily distinguish- ed, especially if the groove be made in the side of the instru- ment. In passing these instruments, whilst with the one hand the instrument is pushed forwards, with the other the penis should be drawn as it were upon the instrument. The membrane of the urethra being in itself very irritable, and surrounded by irritable muscles, which by their contrac- tion mechanically oppose the passage of an instrument through the urethra, it follows, that when a metallic instrument is to be passed, it should be previously immersed in warm water, or kept for some time in contact with the body of a iiving person. The act of passing an instrument along the very irritable mucous lining of the urethra, creates at first, the most dis- agreeable sensations, and on some occasions fainting ; but af- ter an instrument has been repeatedly passed, this membrane, like others of a similar description, loses much of its sensibi- lity. Much attention should be paid to the posture of the patient during the passing a bougie, catheter or sound, into the blad- der. The shoulders should be elevated, the knees drawn up- wards, and the feet supported on a chair, in order to throw' all the parts into a state of relaxation. The bulb of the urethra being out of the direct course of the urethra, it sometimes happens that the catheter is stopped at that part of the urethra ; which may generally be got the better of, by making the instrument to pass as it were along the surface of the pubes. As the membrane of the urethra is very elastic, it may be considerably enlarged so as to admit stones of the size of a pea to pass through it. The neck of the bladder also admits of dilatation. This practice, according to Prosper Alpinus, was followed

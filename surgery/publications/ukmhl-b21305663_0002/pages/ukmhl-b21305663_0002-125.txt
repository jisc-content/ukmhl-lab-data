95 OF THE CELLS OF THE LUNGS. the heart, that they may lodge the great quantity of blood which is accumulated, when the equal play of the lungs is any how interrupted, just as, in the diving animals, such as the seal, there are great dilatations in the vena cava. And the inequality of the play of the lungs perhaps makes these parts by use to bear a greater proportion to the left side, than they did originally. Besides which, by making the pulmonary veins small, the blood passes more difficultly, or undergoes a greater com- pression ; and it is manifest, that one great use of the lungs is, by agitation and compression, to produce some great change in the blood. Perhaps, too, the blood being thrown with greater velocity through the straight pulmonary veins, may more powerfully stimulate the left side of the heart, and enable it to drive its blood with greater force through the wide extended system of the aorta. From a considerable number of trials made with different injected materials, I have found, that the communications or anastomoses of the pulmonary artery, with its corresponding veins, are larger than in most other parts of the human body; and that, whilst a fine injection passes with much difficulty from arteries into the veins in many other places, a much less penetrating injection will go easily through the pulmonary system. Having observed this much in general, I next endeavoured to subject the terminations of the pulmonary artery to the microscope, and for that purpose, after having made a coarse injection pass from the pulmonary artery into the vein, I kept the cells of the lungs inflated from the trachea, till the injec- tion was quite cooled and consolidated. In making these injections I likewise remarked, that the finer part of the injection without the colour readily pas- sed into the cells of the lungs and trachea; and, when we consider the quantity of moisture discharged at every expira- tion, we may infer that the passages into the trachea are pa- tulous and numerous. Again, when we consider the uncom- mon nature of this discharge, and that with the moisture, a

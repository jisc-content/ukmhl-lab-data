21 OF THE PERICARDIUM. outer coat; it also adheres, by numerous bands of cellular membrane, to the inner side of the breast-bone, to the central cordiform tendon, and muscular part of the diaphragm, on the left side, opposite to the cartilages of the fifth and sixth ribs, at which place there is, generally, a considerable quantity of fat and cellular substance. The pericardium is also supported by the mediastinum an- terius; hence the bloodvessels going into, or coming out from the heart, cannot be elongated and continued in their diame- ter, and, from the same cause, the heart cannot so readily compress the lungs, if it be not enlarged. The pericardium is rough externally, where it is connected to the sternum, pleura, and diaphragm, and covered fre- quently by portions of fat; but internally it is remarkably smooth, and lubricated by a serous fluid, which has been analysed by Dr Bostock. According to that author, 100 parts contain Of Water - 92.0 Albumen - 5.5 Mucus - 2.0 Muriate of Soda 0.5 The liquor pericardii, which is poured out by invisible ori- fices, prevents the bad effects of friction. Though the pericardium possesses a considerable share of firmness, yet it admits of considerable distention, as is evident when water has been accumulated within it; in which case, the pulsations of the heart are felt between the seventh and eighth ribs, instead of between the fifth and sixth ribs, and sometimes even on the right side of the chest. Water accumulated within the pericardium produces diffi- cult breathing, and impedes the circulation in particular situa- tions of the body. In this disease, there is also difficulty in feeling the pulse, when the patient lies on his right side, which is owing to the water pressing on the heart, and forming a column between it and the intercostal muscles ; but when the patient lies on his left side, there is less difficulty, the apex of the heart ap- proaching nearer to the side. When there is an adhesion of

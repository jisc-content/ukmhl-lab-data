OF THE CARDIAC NERVES. 525 from which the right coronary plexus is derived, which passes between the pulmonary artery and aorta, and then along the coronary vessels. From the great cardiac plexus of the left side, a nervous plexus extends on the left coronary artery; and from this, small nerves creep along the surface of the left coronary arte- ries to the point of the heart *. The cardiac nerves being sent off, the sympathetic nerves unite into a trunk behind the subclavian artery, and descend along the heads, and over the heads of the ribs, and a gan- glion is formed by their junction with the intercostal nerves *f*. From the sixth, seventh, and eighth dorsal ganglia, branches arise, which form the nerve called by Haller ner- vus splanchnicus, which passes through the appendix of the diaphragm, and supplies the bowels of the abdomen. The sympathetic nerve forms an intricate plexus upon the vertebral artery; it passes between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries, and give many filaments to the last named artery. The sympathetic nerve then divides into two parts, one of which passes over the fore-part of the left bronchus, and is lost in a plexus placed behind the pulmonary veins. The other or greater part of the sympathetic nerve passes along the back-part of the subclavian artery, forming along it an intricate plexus; it also sends many filaments over the fore-part of the subclavian artery, several of which unite with the superficial cardiac nerves, and form a plexus on the pul- monary artery, from which several filaments proceed to the left auricle of the heart. Of the Intercostal or Dorsal Nerves. These nerves, after being sent off from the spinal marrow, are lodged in the grooves in the lower edges of the ribs, and advance to the fore-part of the chest between the intercostal muscles. There are branches of these nerves which supply the mus- • Vide Scarpa’s Third Plate of the Nerves of the Neck, t v*dc Mokro’s Nervous System, Plate xi.

The inner surfaces of the thalami nervorum opticorum of the corresponding lateral ventricles are flat, and united by a soft transverse plate of medullary substance called the Com- missura Mollis. The posterior parts of the thalami, called Tractus Optici, are of a white colour, and flat; they are directed outwards and downwards in the form of a curve ; they ci*oss over the crura cerebri, and at length terminate in the thalami nervo- rum opticorum. There are two tubercles connected with the lower portions of the thalami nervorum opticorum, which have been called by Santorini Corpora geniculata: they consist chiefly of white matter. The greater part of the tractus opticus is concealed by the middle lobes of the brain, excepting about an inch of the an- terior portion. Under the commissura mollis, and between the thalami nervorum opticorum, there is a deep fissure, called the third ventricle; and a funnel-like cavity, called infundibulum, runs downwards and forwards, and is fixed by its narrow extremity to the pituitary gland. The infundibulum is about half an inch long. * Vide J. and C. Wenzel, Dc Penitiori Structure Cerebri, p. 107, 108.

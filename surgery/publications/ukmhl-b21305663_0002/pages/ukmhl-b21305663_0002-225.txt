OF THE TESTES OF TIIE FOETUS. 187 Ammonia is formed during the exposure of semen to the air. When exposed to the air, it deliquesces, becomes pellucid, and perfectly liquid. A hundred parts of the semen, according to Vauqjjeltn contain 90 of water, 6 of mucilage, 8 of phosphate of lime, and 1 of soda. The semen also, contains a great number of living bodies, which have been said to have a rounded head, with a gently tapering tail f, and which are a thousand times smaller than a hair. These small animals may also be observed in the semen of quadrupeds, reptiles, birds and fishes. Buffox has stated, that the description by Leufnhoeck of these small animals in semen, is incorrect; he observes, they are destitute of tails. The more recent observations of Spallaxzaxi, on this sub- ject, accord perfectly with the original description of Leuen- hoeck. Mr J. Huxteii j has described the contents of the vesiculae seminales, in two persons who died violent deaths, as different from semen, as being in one “ of a lightish whey colour, and having nothing of the smell of semen, and as being so fluid, as to run out on cutting into them;'’ and in the other, the fluid was lighter than is usually found in those who have been dead a considerable time. If the vesiculae be glands which secrete mucus, as there is so free a communication between the vasa deferentia and ve- siculae seminales, it seems probable, that a certain propor- tion of semen must, in all cases, be mixed with the contents of the vesiculae seminales. A part of the semen is probably absorbed, which communicates a peculiar foetor to the flesh „ of animals during the rutting season; and hence the difference in the flesh of the castrated and perfect animal. • Annal. de Chim. tom. ix, p. 64. ■f Fid.

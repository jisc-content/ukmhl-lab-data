ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 158 muscular fibres, various depressions are formed, giving to the inside of the bladder an irregular reticulated appearance. About two inches above and behind the openings of the ure- ters, the largest fibres run in a transverse direction, and be- tween them are observed very distinct oval shaped fissures. Towards the lateral and fore part of the bladder they become smaller and pass more obliquely. Near the attachment of the urachus, the transverse and oblique fibres gradually diminish in size, converging to its base, on which they are lost. A set of extremely fine fibres, of a yellowish colour, is placed on the trigone, proceeding from different directions, but chiefly from behind, forwards to its sides; they, at its margin, suddenly assume a small size, resembling, in fineness and minuteness of texture, the muscles described by Wii.son. A very prominent set of the fibres proceeds, almost trans- versely, between the openings of the ui'eters. The rest of these fibres surround the under part of the neck of the blad- der in numerous concentric layers, terminating at each side of the fore-part of the neck ; from this they pass backwards in a curvilinear form, and are convex towards the centre of the trigone. On the superior part of the neck of the bladder another set of fibres, redder and larger than those described, is obser- ved, disposed in a circular, but opposite direction, around the upper part of the neck of the bladder, which are covered by the under set of concentric fibres. The exterior fibres diverge considerably towards the sides of the bladder, whereas the in- terior, alter closely embracing the neck of it, are lost in the under concentric fibres, with which they are intimately inter- mixed. SECTION V. OF THE PENIS. The penis is an organ which is intended to conduct the se- men into the uterus and vagina of the female: it is placed in

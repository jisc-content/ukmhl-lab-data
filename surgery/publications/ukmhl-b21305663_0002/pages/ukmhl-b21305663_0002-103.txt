73 OF THE AIll-TUBES. SECTION I. OF THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. The air-tubes and air-cells may be said to be the basis of the lungs. The air enters the lungs through a cartilaginous tube, the uppermost part of which is called the Larynx; from this a tube descends, which has been usually called the Trachea, which divides into two great branches called Bron- chi, which are subdivided into very minute branches through the substance of the lungs. The larynx is not only an air- tube, but is also the seat of the voice, and hence is of a com- plicated construction, and differently constructed in different animals. Of the Larynx. The larynx, which forms the fore-part of the pharynx, is placed between the os hyoides and upper part of the wind- pipe, and is a prominent feature of the neck of the male, forming the projection commonly called pomum Aclami. The size of the larynx is not uniform in all individuals of the same sex, age, and stature; it is not proportioned to the stature, and is in all much larger after than before puberty, and is more capacious in the male than in the female. Cas- tration has a great effect upon the size of the larynx, as that of the eunuch is much less expanded than that of the more perfect male. The larynx, in point of form, is symmetrical, and in shape somewhat resembles a funnel, the small extremity of which is conjoined with the trachea. The cartilages of the larynx are uniform as to structure, and are united to each other by membranes, ligaments, and muscles, by which they are moved upon each other. Five cartilages have been described as being proper to the larynx ; but of these, one, called Epiglottis, is merely the lid which covers the larynx.

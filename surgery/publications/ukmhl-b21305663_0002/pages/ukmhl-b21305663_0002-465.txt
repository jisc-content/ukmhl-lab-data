OF THE MUSCLES OF THE EYE-BALL. 419 posterior part of the capsule of the lens, at the like distance, nearly of one-twentieth of an inch from its outer edge; and, at the distance, therefore, of one-tenth of an inch from the connection of its anterior layer and retina with the lens. The outer edge, therefore, of the crystalline lens, covered with its proper capsule only, occupies a space nearly one-tenth of an inch in breadth, between the two layers of the capsule of the vitreous humour. “ The anterior layer of the capsule of the vitreous humour being fixed to the crystalline lens, at the distance nearly of one-tenth of an inch from the attachment of its posterior layer, —a canal, bounded by the two layers of the vitreous humour, and by the edge of the crystalline lens, as its basis, is formed, which was discovered by Dr Petit, and is named after him *. Air, blown into this space, passes, of course, around the crys- talline lens. Each of the two layers of the capsule of the vitreous humour is tougher than the posterior part of the capsule, and adheres firmly to the capsule of the lens.” Sir E. Home mentions, that “ he had observed, in the eye of bullocks, a semitransparent tube, resembling the coats of a lymphatic vessel, which terminated in the vitreous humour.” I have remarked, more than twelve years ago, in a case of fungus haematodes of the eye, several small tumours, very like to enlarged lymphatic glands, situated along the optic nerve; and though there is no such tube as that noticed by Sir E. visible in the human eye, the above fact seems to me to confirm the opinion of Sir Everaro as to the nature of the vessel he had observed in the eye of the ox, and through which the poison had passed, which had created the swelling of the lymphatic glands of the orbit. Muscles of the Eye-Ball. 1 here are six muscles which move the eye-ball; five of which take their origin from the sides of the foramen opti- * Vide Mem. de l’Acad. des Sciences, 1726. V d 2

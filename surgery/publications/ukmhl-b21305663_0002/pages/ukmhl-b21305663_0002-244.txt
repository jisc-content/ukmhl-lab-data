206 ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. he placed his patients after the manner of Frere Jacques, lying on their backs, with their hips elevated ; that he secured them by two short ligatures, made of flannel; each were not above four feet long. The patient being laid on the table, his wrist was fastened by one of the ligatures, by a loop to the leg of the same side, not to the ancle, as is the practice of others, but to the knee; and the same method was observed on the left side. “ I concluded that, in this way of Rait, the sphyncter of the bladder was cut, which made the operation every way easier. I immediately thought on trying this way, which I did by making at first a large oblique incision from the pro- tuberant part of the staff, or catheter, towards the os ischium. “ I plunged the point of my knife or bistourie, which was two-edged, into the groove of the protuberant part of the staff; and, bringing the head, which I held with my left hand, forwards from the belly, the staff naturally went back- wards into the bladder, and the bistourie being held fast by my right hand, and pressed on the convex part of the staff, followed into the bladder, and cut its sphyncter, so as the urine came rushing out in plenty; after this, the gorgeret, or conductors male and female, were easily introduced into the bladder by the groove of the staff, and the forceps, by the help of these ; and then the forceps was easily dilated, so as to receive or apprehend the stone betwixt their branches ; after which, I found no difficulty in extracting the stone. So that the grand secret of cutting for the stone, in my opinion, lies in cutting the sphyncter of the bladder, either the way de- scribed, according to Rau, or by Mr Cheseldex’s method of cutting from behind the prostate gland forward to the bul- bous part of the urethra : and, in both ways, there always is cut an artery or two, which must be tied up with a crooked needle and thread, and thus the operation is ended. “ I also tried the high operation, or cutting the bladder above the ossa pubis; 4 of 12 patients died. Finding great difficul- ty to bring the wound to a suppuration, by the continual bubbling out of the urine through it, I gave up this way also, and continued to operate in Rau’s way with tolerable success.” 3

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 276 Of the Veins which correspond with the Branches of the Aorta, and Subclavian Arteries which are proper to the Thorax. T-he intercostal veins correspond in size and situation with the intercostal arteries. The lower aortic left intercostal veins unite, and form the beginning of the Vena Azygos, which crosses the aorta, runs upwards along the spine, and receives, during its ascent, the intercostal veins of the right side of the chest, as also the bronchial veins, and then joins the Vena Cava Superior. There is also a small venous trunk on the left side of the body, called Left Vena Azygos, which is formed by the supe- rior intercostal veins, bronchial veins of the left side, and veins of the gullet. The left, or smaller vena azygos, terminates in the subcla- vian vein of the left side. I have sometimes seen this vein wanting; and, in that case, the right vena azygos is larger than usual. The subclavian vein lies before the corresponding artery. It passes under the subclavian muscle, and over the anterior scalenus muscle and first rib. Of the Branches of the Aorta sent of within the Abdomen, or of the Abdominal Aorta. By Abdominal Aorta, is understood, that portion of the aorta which intervenes between the diaphragm and the divi- sion of the aorta into its two great branches, called the iliaccc communes. The aorta passes between the tendinous columns of the smaller muscle of the diaphragm. The aperture between these columns is much larger than the aorta. It is filled by cellular substance, which unites the pleura and peritonaeum ; and hence the flow of blood through it cannot be affected by the contraction of the diaphragm. The Abdominal Aorta is situated on the left side of the bo- dies of the vertebrae; and approaches gradually to the middle of the vertebrae.

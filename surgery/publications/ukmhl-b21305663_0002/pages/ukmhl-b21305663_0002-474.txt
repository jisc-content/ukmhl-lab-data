When the eye-lids cover the eye-ball the wrinkles totally disappear. The eye-lids, or palpebra?, are of unequal size, the upper being the larger, and the more moveable. The eye-lids are attached to the anterior edge of the orbit, by a condensed cellular substance, which has been by some authors described as the ligaments of the eye-lids. The eye-lids are composed of thin skin, and a portion of the orbicularis muscle, and of the tarsal cartilages situated at the edges of the eye-lids. The cellular substance of the eye-lids is remarkably fine, and is kept moist by a serous fluid, which in some cases is ac- cumulated in considerable quantity, and which gives the eye- lids a bluish tint. The internal surfaces of the eye-lids are quite smooth, and continually lubricated by a mucous fluid, which is de- rived from sebaceous glands. On the anterior edges of the tarsal cartilages the hairs cal- led Eye-laslies are placed. The eye-lids are united at each end, and are said by ana- tomists to form the angles, or canthi; the internal is rounded, but the external is acute. On the edge of each of the eye-lids, there is a thin plate of cartilage, which describes an arch ; and this cartilage is thicker and broader in its middle than at either extremity, at what have been called the external and internal angles. The Tarsal Cartilages are thin and flexible, and keep the eye-lids always extended and accommodated to the form of the eve-ball. â€¢/ The posterior edges of the tarsal .cartilages are so shaped, as to form a triangular groove for the tears, when the eye-lids are shut; and as the outer angle of the eye-lids is higher than the inner, the tears are directed towards the puncta lacryma- lia; the mouths of which are placed at the inner angle. When the upper eye-lid has been raised, the tarsal carti- lage keeps the eye-lid extended and smooth.

The part of ^be .^^f allr to the stricture. 2. The stricture. 3 The urethra behind the stricture. 4. The bladder. 5. The mreters and kidneys 1 The Urethra anterior to the Stricture is perfectly healthy, unless it has been injured by instruments. If the cut edge of the mucous membrane be taken in aU of forceps, it will be found to show \^^Zt" ot^^Tt^ elasticity. Its colour is pink, and it is semi-transparent. The spaces of the spongy tissue beneath are empty and open, or fiUed with blood. 9 The Stricture.-At the narrowed part the surface ot the mucous mem- bra"ne is of an opaque white colour, marked by longitudinal ridges, and o ten parchment-like in appearance. If its edge be seized in the forceps it will be found to possess but little, if any, elasticity, and to be firmly fixed to the parts beneath. The submucous tissue, instead of forming a dehcate areolar layer, is represented by tough rigid fibrous tissue firmly adherent on one side to the mucous membrane, and blending on the other with the cavernous tissue ot the corpus spongiosum. The spaces of the spongy tissue are, in all more advanced specimens, obliterated for a greater or less extent near the stricture, so that tne corpus spongiosum at this spot is converted into a dense sohd mass. In very extreme cases the chronic inflammatory induration extends even to the areolar tissue beyond. -The character of the stricture varies greatly. In some_cases it is annular, encircling the whole canal equally for some little distance. W hen it is elongated, there is usually marked consolidation of the corpus spongiosum, as in Fig. 910. In other cases, again, annular strictures may be narrow and sharp-edged, and are then called " pack-thread " or " bridle " strictures ; con- sisting of bands stretching- across the urethra (Fig. 911). Sometimes there are several of tHese in close proximity to one another, leaving merely narrow passages between or under them. These bands occasionally stretch directly across the canal, but more commonly they take a somewhat oblique direction

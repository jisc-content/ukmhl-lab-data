In all cases of doubt the diagnosis may be readily made by means of the aspirator. The presence of pus having been determined, there should be no delay in removing it. The longer it is left, the more firmly the lung becomes bound down by adhesions, and the probability of its perfect expansion becomes less. Moreover, the pus may burrow beyond the limits of the pleural cavity, finding its way down- wards into the iliac fossa, or more rarely into the abdominal cavity, and thus add greatly to the gravity of the case. The proportion of cases of empyema which are cured by simple aspiration is so small that valuable time should not be lost in attempting this before proceeding to drain the cavity. The operation of opening the pleura for empyema, though one of the most ancient in surgery, was until recently so unsatisfactory in its results that it was resorted to only in the last extremity. The fatal result that so frequently

iM XAGEMENT OF- GANGRENOUS INTESTINE. ^853 procvnosis should be given ; and, m reducing the gut_ a/^e Jiv>sio Scture, care should be taken not to push it far back m o th^^^ to leave it near the inner ring ; so that, m the event of its ultimately g . way, there may be less risk of feculent extravasatiou mto the peri onea cavi y In those cases in which the nipping has been very severe, the sulcus be distinctly marked, and the intestine excessively dark and congested ^gh^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ gangrenous, it would, I think, be better to treat ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^ it were so and, after dividing the stricture, to leave it outside the ring instead of returning it; the reduction of intestine in this state being almost invariably followed by fatal peritonifcis. It is important to observe that it is not always possible to tell certainly whether the gut is past recovery or not. Intestine which has been so severely nipped as to be unable to recover its vitality, and which will fall into a state of gangrene after being reduced, may not, at the time of its exposure, present the characters of putrescence : there is no foetor, no green or pulpy appearance, no loss of polish, nor separation of peritoneum ; it is simply of a dark purple or maroon colour, and that it'has been tiffhtlv nipped is evident from Fig. SOl.-Gangrene of intestine from o ^ ri . Strangulation. the sulcus upon it. There are no signs of gangrene, simply because sufficient time has not elapsed for putrefaction to set in. As, when a pile or nsevus has been tied, though vitality be extinct in the part, some time must elapse before signs of putrescence manifest themselves, so it may be with a strictured gut. , Management of Gangrenous or Ulcerated Intestine.â€”When the intestine is actually gangrenous, the integuments covering the tumour will be infiltrated, brawny, and duskily congested, and the structures immediately overlying the sac matted together ; the sac will contain fetid dark-coloured serum or pus; and the softened, lacerable, or pulpy look of the protruded part, its loss of lustre, and peculiar greenish-black or dark-grey colour, will cause the nature of the mischief to be readily recognized. In the majority of cases there will be much constitutional depression, with clammy skin, tympanitic abdomen, and brown or black tongue ; but in some instances I have known all these symptoms to be absent, and the condition of the patient to present no very unfavourable features. Much difference of opinion has always existed among Surgeons as to the proper line of practice in such cases, and the question is far from settled at the present day. The treatment of those cases in which only a small ulceration exists in the bowel will need separate consideration, but when the gut is actually gangrenous in a part or the whole of its circumference, the two courses which are open to the Surgeon are : 1. To make an artificial anus, which, should the patient recover, may

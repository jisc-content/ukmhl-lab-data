ACUTE INTUSSUSCEPTION. apparent parfcial reduction of the invagination. The whole _mass forms a lounded saiisage-hke tumour. On making an incision into it through the sheath the mucous surface of the reflected tube will be brought into view m contact with that of the sheath. On further cutting through the reflected tube a space is found between the serous coats of the reflected and entering tubes containing the mesentery (Fig. 816). In very rare cases double intussusceptions, composed of five layers, or triple, with seven layers, have been observed. An intussusception increases entirely at the expense of the sheath, the line of reflection between the entering and reflected tubes remaining unchanged. The length of the part invaginated varies greatly. When limited to the small in- lestine it is usually short—not more than two or three inches in length ; in the Fig. 816.—An intussusception dissected. large gut as many feet may be involve^. The intussusceptum is more or less severely strangulated at the point of the reflection between the reflected tube and the sheath. This usually seems in part to be caused by the closely-packed folds of the sheath at the neck of the intussusception. The entering and reflected tubes are therefore intensely injected with blood, and swollen, and the mesentery included in the space between them is in a similar condition. In some exceptional cases of intussusception of the colon there is little constriction; so Uttle, in fact, that the lumen of the gut may not be completely occluded. There is reason to believe that in very shght cases the intussusception may undergo spontaneous reduction. In other cases, when the strangulation is not sufficiently severe to cause gangrene of the intussusceptum, though it seriously

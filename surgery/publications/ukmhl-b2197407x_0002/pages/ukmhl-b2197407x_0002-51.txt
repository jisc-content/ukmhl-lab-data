CORlYS—FEEFOEATING ulcer of the foot. 19 people, in whom fatal gangrenous inflammation may be excited by their action. Suppurating Corn.—Under old and very thickened corns, a small bursa is usually found, in which pus is occasionally formed. The imprisonment of a small drop of matter under the thickened cuticle gives rise to the most intense agony, and may cause oedema and redness extending from the toe to the foot, and sometimes up the leg. The TreaMent consists in softening the corn with a water dressing, shaving it down, and letting out the drop of pus by puncture Avith a lancet, when immediate relief from pain will result. If the pus is not thus let out it cannot point through the indurated cuticle, and may burrow beneath the skin for some distance before finding an exit. In such case a troublesome sinus is left which can sometimes be closed by the injection of stimulating lotions; more often, however, laying it open is the only efficient treatment. " Black Corn."—This name is popularly given to a special form of warty corn, met with only on the sole of the foot, which may become the source of the greatest possible pain and inconvenience to the patient, altogether preventing his walking. It is usually of small size and circular in shape, the neighbouring cuticle being always considerably thickened. It is extremely sensitive to the touch, the patient shrinking when it is pressed upon, as if an exposed nerve had been injured. On slicing it down with a scalpel, it will be found to be composed of soft, tough, and white epidermis, arranged in tufts or small columns, in the centre of each of which a minute black dot is per- ceptible Each tuft appears to be an elongated and thickened papilla, and the black speck is a small point of coagulated blood which has been effused into It. The whole group of enlarged papilte is surrounded by a kind of wall of thickened epithelium. The Treatment of this varietv of corn consists in destroying it with a caustic. I have found the application of either fumino- nitric acid or potassa fusa, so as to destroy it thoroughly, to be the best and speediest remedy ; and as this corn always occurs in young people no danger attends the use of these substances. PERFORATii.a Ulcer op the FooT.-This, though not in reality a disease of the skm, IS perhaps most conveniently considered here. The disease seems usually to commence in a corn situated on the sole of the foot opposite the head of one of the metatarsal bones-usually the first.

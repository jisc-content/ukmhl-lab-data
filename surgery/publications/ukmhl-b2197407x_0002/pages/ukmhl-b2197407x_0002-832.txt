These results corresp nd almost exactly with an analysis of 642 cases by Gross. The earliest case con- firmed by microscopic examination is recorded by Henry of Breslau as occar- ring m a young woman aged 21. I have removed a scirrhous breast from an unmarried woman 23 years of age, and Bryant has seen it at 25, 26, and '->% In young subjects the tumour is apt to grow rapidly and to assume the form of encephaloid, but most of the recorded cases have been of the scirrhous variety. In elderly women also scirrhus is the prevalent form, though I have seen several instances of encephaloid at an advanced age. Social Condition.—Bryant states that of the 600 cases observed by himself 80 per cent, were or had been married; and Gross made the proportion 88 per cent, m his cases. According to the Registrar-General's returns, 84 per cent of the women in London over 35 years of age are or have been married. It would seem probable, therefore, that cancer occurs proportionally with equal frequency in married and single women. Of the married women in Bryant's cases, no fewer than 26 per cent, were sterile ; while Gross makes the proportion only 1(; per cent. Both Bryant and Von Winiwarter observe that a large pro- portion of the prolific women had borne many children. The menstrual func- tion is persistent at the time the disease appears in 70 per cent, according to Birkett, and 61 per cent, according to Gross. Injuries inflicted upon the breast, such as blows, squeezes, &c., jire com- monly referred to, and are greatly dreaded by women, as the causes of cancer.

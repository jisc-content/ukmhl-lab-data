990 DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. As extreme measures which are only justifiable in very exceptional cas.. especially m adults, may be mentioned excision of the prolapse and fixation the prolapsed bowel by abdominal section. If excisio'n bTp^c^ f^^^^^^ be remembered hat the peritoneum will probably be opened, and that sma intestme inay have prolapsed into the peritoneal piuch. The operate consists in dividing the outer and inner tubes of the prolapse in small segment at a time and bringing together the serous coat, and the muscular and mucou^ coats with two separate rows of sutures. Fixation of the rectum by abdomina section has been successfully carried out by Caddy, of Calcutta, in a man age.i thirty-two. An incision was made very similar to that used in iuLminai colotomy, and the rectum being drawn up to the full extent, it wa- attached to the muscles and peritoneum of the abdominal wall by means of two silk sutures passing through the meso-rectum. Protrusion of an Ovarian Cyst from the Anns occurred in a unique case recorded by Stocks of Salford. The cyst, which was the size of a cocoa- nut, was removed by incision through the coats of the bowel which were forced out before the tumour; and after the wound had healed, the gut was returned.

I040 URINARY CALCULUS AND LITHOTOMY. ounces of tepid water, so as to distend the organ slightly, and prevent the of mucous membrane from overlapping any coaci-etion that may exist in it Its interior is then carefully explored in the way already described ; and, if the stone cannot then be detected, the contents of the bladder are gradually allowed to escape through the sound, and the patient is desired to stand up whilst the exploration is being proceeded with. In this way, by examining a patient in different positions and in different conditions of the bladder as to capacity, a calcuhis is sure to be detected if one exist. A lithotrite may occasionally be used advantageously as a sound for the detection of small calculi lying behind Fig. S51.â€”HoUow Sound. the prostate, a situation more readily reached by its short beak than by an instrument of larger curve. These examinations must not, however, be too protracted. When a stone is struck by the sound, there is not only a charac- teristic and distinct shock communicated to the instrument, but a tolerably loud click is given, which can be heard by the bystanders, and frequently by the patient, as well as by the Surgeon. Rough sounding is doubly injurious. It injures the bladder and fails to find the stone. The stone is often missed in sounding, especially when small. by being carried to and fro as the urine and the bladder are moved backwards and forwards by rough manipulation. It will be found, if the parts are allowed to become quiescent, that the stone falls to the bottom behmd the prostate, where it will be found by a gentle tap of the sound. _ By conducting the sounding properly, the Surgeon may usually ascertam not only the existence of a stone, but its size and hardness ; whether it be snigie, if it be encysted, and the general state of the bladder ; with all of wlncii points it is of importance that he should be acquainted before undertaking

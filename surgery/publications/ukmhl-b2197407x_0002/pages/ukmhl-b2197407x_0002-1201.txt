H.P«P«Pnneiices Gonorrhceal Epididymitis is certainly the most ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ It almost invariably affects only one testis, and commences in the epididynn , lllr^ eTends \o the body of the organ. It usually occurs m indivi^^^^^^ who have a lax and long scrotum, with very P^^^^^^^^^^f in before the third week after the occurrence of gonorrhoea but may occur at any pe iod du ing the continuance of the discharge, though it is more fi-equent Sen the fifth and sixth weeks than at any other time. In cases 0 g ee , also it not uncommonly occurs at a later period. In many instances it is S lid to some shght injury-a blow, or squeeze, received during the con- "e of the gonorrh J ; but in some cases it would ^Ppe-to anse^^^^^^ extension of the inflammation along the ejaculatory duct. It ^a foimei^ believed to arise in some cases from so-called metastasis of inflammation from the urethra to the testis. That the disease commences in tlie epididymis may be advanced in support of the first opinion ; whilst the fact that the discharge usuaUy ceases when the inflammation of the testicle comes on and returns as it subsides, has been adduced in support of the doctrine of its metastatic orio-in Curling was of opinion that the diminution of discharge is due to counter-irritation, as he had seen a case in which the urethral discharge ceased, although the orchitis had been occasioned by a blow. As tne symptoms and treatment of gonorrhceal inflammation of the testicle present nothing pecdiar, I shall reserve their consideration until I come to speak of diseases of this organ. Gonorrhceal epididymitis is apt to be followed by long-continued gleet, consequent on the exudation from the Immg mem- branes^of the vas deferens, and the secretory apparatus of the testes. Gonorrhceal Inflammation of the Vesiculae Seminales is probably more common than is generally supposed, for as Jordan Lloyd, who has drawn special attention to this complication, has pointed out, its symptoms closely resemble those of prostatitis. These are painful and frequent micturition, painful defEPcation, with occasionally painful emissions and priapism. On rectal examination the vesicute are felt as elongated swelUngs above the prostate. The inflammation of these bodies is no doubt due to direct extension from the urethra. The Treatment is the same as for acute prostatitis. Gonorrhceal Inflammation of the Eyes is fortunately not of very common occurrence. It may affect either the conjunctiva or the sclerotic. Gonorrhceal Conjunctivitis is one of the most destructive forms of purulent ophthalmia, giving rise not unfrequently, in the course of forty-eight hours, to the most intense chemosis, with opacity and softening of the cornea, followed by staphyloma and escape of the aqueous humour. It results from direct infection of the conjunctival sac with the gonorrhceal discharge. In the majority of instances only one eye is affected ; but, in some, both are involved to an equal extent. The disease commences with the ordinary symptoms of conjunctival inflammation ; itching and swelling of the eyelids, • velvety redness of the conjunctiva, muco-purulent discharge, with much

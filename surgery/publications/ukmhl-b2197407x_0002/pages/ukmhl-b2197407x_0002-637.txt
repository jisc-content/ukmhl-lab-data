SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA OF LIP. 603 should, if possible, avoid cutting through the whole thickness of the lip ; and, if compelled to do so, he must act as will be described in speaking of cancer of this region. (See p. 605.) These growths most frequently occur on the lower lip. . . , . Cysts are usually small and transparent, with thin walls, containmg a glairy sbraw-colonred fluid. These should always be dissected out ; mere excision of a portion of the wall being followed by recurrence of the disease. Na'ri of the lip and their treatment have akeady been fully described (p. 77). Warty Growths are common on the lip, and are apt after existing some »jtime to become carcinomatous. Sometimes crusts of epithelium, forming fjhorn-like projections, are developed on the surface. They are best treated by ''early removal, no local application being of much use, and the danger of their becoming malignant being very considerable. Squamous Carcinoma.—The structure of epithelioma has been so fully described in Vol. I., p. 1069, that it need not detain us here. Epithelioma of the lip commences either as a warty growth, -which gradually ulcerates, or as an indurated crack or fissure, the edges of which have a ten- dency to spread. The submaxillary lymphatic glands tend to become early 1 involved ; and the disease, if unrelieved by operation, will eventually prove fatal by the pain, exhaustion, and constitutional irritation thus induced. The ilisease almost invariably occurs in men, and in the lower lip ; I have never met with a case affecting the lower lip of a woman. It is met with after the middle period of life. Of twenty consecutive cases in which I

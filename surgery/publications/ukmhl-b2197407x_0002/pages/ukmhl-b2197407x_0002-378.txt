346 DISEASES OF JOINTS. tuberculous hydrops and empyema. Tuberculous hydrops has been so called by Koiiig- on account of the extensive effusion into the joint which occurs. He states that it may be caused by diffuse tuberculosis of the synovial membrane with or without marked thickening. When the membrane is thickened, it is due, in some cases, to the deposit of fibrinous layers upon it, especially on the fringes, which may become villous or even polypoid in appear- ance. In these cases loose bodies may be present in the joint. In most instances tuberculous hydrarthrosis ends sooner or later in the more usual forms of the disease. It occurs most commonly in young adults, very rarely in children. In ktherculous enipymna of a joint the cavity is filled with curdy pus before the synovial membrane is obviously thickened. According to Cheyne, this form occurs especially in old people. Primary Tubercle of Bone.—Having briefly considered the most impor- Fi". 042.—Bones from a case of tuberculous disease of the knee-joint showing large wedge-shaped sequestra in the inner condyle of the femur and the corresponding surface of the tibia. tant changes which take place in a joint as the result of tuberculous disease of the synovial membrane, it remains to describe the changes resulting from secondary infection of the joint from a primary deposit of tubercle in one of the bones entering into its formation. The changes in the bone itself have already been described (p. 265), and consist in a destructive inflammation of the cancellous tissue around a tuberculous deposit. Not uncommonly the carious cavity contains a more or less wedge-shaped sequestrum, the broader end of which may lie immediately beneath the articular cartilage (Fig. 542). When the disease has reached the deep surface of the cartilage, this is gradually destroyed from below in a manner similar to that in which it is eroded from the superficial surface in primary disease of the synovial membrane.

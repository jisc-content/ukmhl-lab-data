LITHOTRITY: THE OPERATION. i°83 operating an anaesthetic is essential, both to enable the S-geo^^^^^^^^^^^ the operation till the stone is completely crushed, and to facilitate the BUbse quent washing out of the fragments. ^ .-, i • f^nr «fn(rps • ^ Operationt-The operation of lithotrity may be divided into four stages . 1 The introduction of the lithotrite ; 2. The search for and seizure of he stone; 3. The crushing of the stone ; and 4. The evacuation of the 'Trpreliminary step before the operation. Bigelow ^^^^^ the urethra be measured with Otis's urethrometer, in order to ascertain the size of the evacuator that should be used. Thompson recommends t^e passage of a large conical steel bougie, which answers the same purpose and at the same time slightly dilates the canal. The bougies passed should be fron^ Nos 14 to 18 of the Enghsh scale at the thicke^. part. With a urethra admitting No. 16 no difficulty need be anticipated in the operation, even if the stone is large. If the orifice is too narrow to admit this, it should at once be divided with a probe-pointed bistoury. „ , , • ^ 1. Introduction of the Lithotrite.-If the size of the stone is known, Fig. 888.—Introduction of the Lithotrite. the lithotrite must be adapted to it. If it be large and probably hard, a fiiU- sized, fenestrated lithotrite should first be passed, with which the oalculuS'may be broken into several small fragments. After this it may be withdrawn, and a smaller non-fenestrated instrument used to complete the crushing. ^ The operation may most conveniently be performed with the patient lying on his back upon a flat table close to its right edge. The pelvis must be raised by a hard pillow, so as to allow the stone to roll up on the posterior surface of the bladder. The Surgeon, standing on the right side of the patient, carefully introduces the hollow sound, or catheter, and draws off the urine ; he then slowly and very cautiously injects the bladder, by means of

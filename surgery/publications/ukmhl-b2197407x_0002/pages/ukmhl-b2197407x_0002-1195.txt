'7t dmi^lt ^hird stage of gonorrhea that Injections may advantage- ously be used! Much andWy unfounded prejudice exists against their use niL minds of many ; but siJely it is as safe to apply proper W appl.- tions to an inflamed urethra as it is to an inflamed conjunctiva 5 ^^j^ ^he bad con^eauences such as stricture and inflamed testicle, which have sometimes bee^?eSto their use, have either been due rather to the long continuance and to the severity of the disease itself than to the remedies employed 01 to their application at too early a stage or of too great a strength. It is m ong- * standing cases of gonorrhoea, in which the discharge continues for months 01 years, that stricture follows, not in cases of ordinary duration ; and it is the result of the chronic inflammatory thickening of the mucous membrane, and has no more to do with the injections than with the copaiba or salines which the patient may have taken. As the ardor urinse subsides, emolhent and shc^htly astringent injections may be used. Perhaps the best is permanganate of zinc in the strength of one, or rarely two, grains to eight ounces of distilled water Berkeley Hill found this injection very free from irritating properties, and most useful except in very chronic cases ; of 70 cases in which he used it, 10 were cured and 54 much improved, in 4 it had no efl'ect, and in 2 it increased the discharge. Chloride of zinc (gr. i to the 5I) and sulpho-carbolate of zinc (gr. ij. to the 3i.) are often useful. Extract of opium or extract of belladonna is frequently added to urethral injections to allay the irritation which they are apt to cause. The permanganate should, however, always be used alone, as it forms an almost explosive mixture with some vegetable extracts. As the disease subsides, a stronger astringent is required, and then one or two grains of the acetate of zinc may be added to each ounce of the injection ; or a weak solution of the sulphate may be employed, gr. ij. to each ounce of water. In the ■ later stages Hill found the sulphates of zinc, alumina, copper, and iron very useful. He frequently prescribed them together, thus : sulphate of zinc 30 to 40 grains, alum 30 to 40 grains, sulphate of iron 20 grains, and sulphate of copper 2 grains, in eight ounces of water. During the whole of this stage,, the diet and ^habits of life must be carefully regulated, and all stimulants interdicted. The injections should be discontinued as soon as the discharge has ceased ; unless this be done, they may re-induce it.

Hence, the only safeguard against the supervention of haemorrhage as soon as the sac has bnrst or been opened, or has discharged its contents, will be the occlusion by thrombosis of that portion of the artery which intervenes between these two collateral branches and its mouth, or the accidental entanglement in the latter of a mass of laminated fibrin. Yet, in the circumstances as to tlie condition of tumour and limb that have just been mentioned, it would be but right for the Surgeon to give the patient a chance of preserving his arm. Should, however, ligsmorrhage occur on or after the discharge of the con- tents of the sac, the subclavian having previously been ligatured, if the bleed- ing be moderate, an attempt should be made to arrest it by plugging the wound, and by the application of a compress and bandage. If it recur, or be so profuse as to threaten the hfe of the patient, two lines of procedure are open to the Surgeon : either to cut through the pectoral muscles so as to lay the sac open fully, and attempt to include the bleeding orifice between the two liga- tures ; or to amputate at the shoulder-joint. If a Surgeon were to adopt the former of these alternatives in a case of spontaneous aneurism, of which alone we are now speaking, he would, in all probability, find the part in such a condition as would prevent the possibility of his completing the operation he had commenced. After laying open a large sloughing cavity, extending under the pectoral muscles perhaps as high as the clavicle, and clearing out the broken-down coagula contained in it, in what state would he find the artery ? Certainly, the probability would be strongly against its being in such a condition as to bear a ligature, even if it could be included in one. Its coats, in the immediate vicinity of the sac, could not, in accordance with what we know to be almost universally the case in spontaneous aneurisms of large size or old standing, be expected to be m anything like a sound firm state, and would ahnost certainly give way under pressure of the noose ; or the vessel might have undergone fusiform dilatation, as is common in this situation, before giving rise to the circumscribed aneurism, in which case it would be impossible to surround it by a ligature ; or again, the subscapular or circumflex arteries might arise directly from, and pour their recurrent blood into, the sac or the dilated artery, and, as they would lie in the midst of inflamed and sloughing tissues, no attempt at including them in a ligature could be successfully made. In such circum- stances as these, the danger of the patient would be considerably increased by the irritation that would be occasioned by laying open and searching for the bleeding vessel in the sac of an inflamed, suppurating, and sloughmg aneurism, and much valuable time would be lost in what must be a fruitless operation ; at the close of which it would, in all probabdity, become necessary to have recourse to amputation, and thus to remove the whole disease a once I should, therefore, be disposed to have recourse to disarhcuMion ai ihe 'shorader-joint at once, in all cases of profuse recurrent ^^^^^^^^^^^ following sloughing of the sac of an axillary aneurism, w^nch could not be aJrested% di?ect pressure on the bleeding orifice, after the subclavian has been tied.

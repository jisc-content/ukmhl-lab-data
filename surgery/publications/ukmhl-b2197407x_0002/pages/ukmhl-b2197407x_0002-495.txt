463 EXCISION OF OS GALOIS. is removed. In fact, in caries of the os calcis, it may often be found, as in performing Syme's amputation, that the thickened periosteum strips off the softened and carious bone as readily as the peel off an orange ; hence a formal process of dissection is scarcely needed. History and Results.—Excision of the os calcis is a very successful operation. It seems to have been first performed by Monteggia in 1813 ; the result appeared promising, when the patient died of scrofulous disease. The operation then fell into abeyance for twenty-four years, when Robert, in 1837, in a case of necrosis of the bone, removed the diseased portion, leaving the healthy peripheral layer. The same Surgeon, in 1844, in a case of caries, Fig. 594.—Excision of the Os Calcis. Fig. 595.—Disease of the Os Galois. 1. Foot before Operation : 2. Foot after Excision. removed the whole bone with the exception of its upper articular surface and the inner side of the body. Greenhow of Newcastle, in this country, and Rigaud, in France, appear to have been the first Surgeons who successfully excised the whole of the os calcis. Their cases occurred in 1848 ; and since that time the operation has been performed in a large number of cases in this country and in America. In France, it seems to have met with little favour, though it has been successfully performed there in several instances, by Oilier, Griraldes, and some other Surgeons. Polaillon, of Paris, in an able article written in 18G'J, with the object of advocating the performance of the operation, collected the records of 64 cases. Of these he set aside 9, of which he was not able to find sufficiently accurate statements as to the result. Of the remaining 55, 39 were successful—this

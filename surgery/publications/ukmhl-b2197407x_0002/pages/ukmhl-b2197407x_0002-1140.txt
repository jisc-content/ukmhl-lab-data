DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. I io8 covering at the opeuing left at the root of the penis (Fig. 89(5), lead to a gnidual increase in the size of the opening and a partial return of tiie symptoms. To prevent this, the fissured penis may be covered in by the following method The whole front of the scrotum, including the dartos, is raised so as to form » a bridge of skin connected with the groin at each side. This is lifted over the< ^ penis, and placed upon a raw surface prepared by turning down a collar or flapr ^ from the lower arched border of the new bladder-covering and from the sidei; of the urethra and penis as far forwards as the glans. A continuous wire, suture is applied to keep tbe flaps in place ; and the transplanted scrotal k Fig. 896.—Wood's Operation for Bxhovertert Bladder.

(After Wood.) structures are united to the border of the bladder-covering by a line of in- terrupted sutures. The scrotal wound is readily closed by wire sutures. Byj this means a sort of urethra is formed, containing the muscular tissue of the' dartos in its roof, which may even give it a slight power of contraction, so as to enable the new bladder to contain small quantities of urine. The second: stage of the operation is often somewhat interfered with by erections of the^ penis. These are best controlled by ice-bags. The knees should be drawn up so as to relieve tension, especially in the first stage of the operation. After: the cure is complete, the patient is often troubled by the growth of hair from' the under surface of the umbilical flap, and the accumulation of phosphates

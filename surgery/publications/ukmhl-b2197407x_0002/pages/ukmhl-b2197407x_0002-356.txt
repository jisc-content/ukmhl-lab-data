STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN BONE. 324 ing, but not iiufrcquently harsh, loud, and whizzinf,^ In the so-called " osteo-aueurism," aocording to N^laton, the bruit is often absent. In pulsating sarcomata I have heard the bruit peculiarly loud, rough, and super- ficial. On compresshig the main artery leading to the part of the limb in which the tumour is situated, all movement and bruit commonly cease in it, and the tumour lessens in size. By pressing upon the growth when it is thus diminished, it will commonly be found to have a bony margin, with a central depression. In some cases the tumour is fed by several arterial branches, which may be felt distinctly pulsating uuder the skin. This is more particularly the case in soft sarcomata occurring upon the bones of the pelvis and the scapula, and then the bruit and pulsation cannot be made to cease in it. AH these signs are commonly somewhat intermittent, the pulsation appearing perhaps ^in the earlier stages of the disease, and disappearing as it advances ; or the reverse may occur, the pulsation and bruit becoming distinct as • Fig. 539.- Vascular Erectile Tumour of one of the Parietal Bones. the disease increases in size and meets with more resistance in its outward ^'°^agnosis.—The distinction between a pulsating sarcoma of bone and the so-called " osteo-aneurism" may be almost impossible; and, indeed it seems probable that the latter is itself in the majority of cases sarcomatous iTm ordinary aneurism the diagnosis of pulsating tumours of bone may be attended with almost insuperable difficulties.

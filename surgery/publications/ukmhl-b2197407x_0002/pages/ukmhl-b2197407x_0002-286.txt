SPECIAL ANEURISMS. 254 The Peroneal Artery has been tied in rare cases for wound in the middle of the leg. It is found by making an incision about three inches in length on the external border of the fibula, which is the first rallying point tn the operation. A thin tendinous layer, forming part of the origin of the soleus, and sometimes a few fleshy fibres, are found attached to the bone. On dividing these, the flexor longus hallucis comes into view. This is cut carefully away from the posterior surface of the bone, and at its inner edge a tube of fascia is found, in which the artery lies between the flexor longus hallucis and tibialis posticus. This must be opened, and the vena comites separated with a director, after which the needle is easily passed.

The diet should oe carefully regulated, and the strength kept up. An occasional enema will otten give considerable relief. Small glycerine enemata are especially useful. ihe smgwal treatment of simple stricture of the rectum consists in dilating tne canal at its constricted point. If this be within reach of the linger the auatation can readily be carried out. If it be above the upper part of the lectum, and the stricture be tight, it is extremely difficult to introduce the proper instruments with certainty. When the stricture is low down, so til at the end of the finger can be introduced into it, it may readily be dilated by introducing a rectum-bougie every second day, and gradually increasing the size of the instrument. If the stricture yield but slowly, and be very tight and indurated, I have found it a convenient plan to introduce a sheathed probe-pointed bistoury into it and to notch it toM-ards its posterior aspect, where this may be done without danger to the peritoneum. A tent of compressed sponge should then be introduced, and left in for twelve hours. On its withdrawal, bougies may more readily be passed ; or the dilatation may be carried on by means of tents. When the stricture is above the reach of the finger, a good deal of management will be required to make the bougie enter it. This is best done by placing the patient on his left side, and using a moderate-sized elastic bougie, softened in warm water and well greased, which must be passed Avithout the employment of any force. When once the Burgeon has introduced one, others can readily be made to follow in the same • track. The great danger in introducing a bougie high up is that of mistaking the obstruction offered by its point coming into" contact wdth one of the valvular folds of mucous membrane present in this situation, for that of the stricture, and, by pushing on the instrument, perforating the bowel—an

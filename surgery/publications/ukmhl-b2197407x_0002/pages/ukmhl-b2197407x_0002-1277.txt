Hence then- presence in the fluid of hydrocele may in most cases be considered as characteristic of the encysted variety of the disease. The Sig^is of encysted hydrocele of the epididymis difi'er in some respects from those presented by hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis. The tumour is smaller, more irregular in shape, and does not envelop the testis completely, but is situated behind and above it, in connexion with the epididymis. The Diagnosis from ordinary hydrocele of the tunica vaginaKs may be made by ob- -, • i serving : 1. That the testis is below and in front, and not covered m by the encysted form of the disease ; 2. That the tumour is more globular or irregular, and less pyriform ; 3. When tapped, the fluid will usually be found to be opalescent. Treatnmit.—lw many cases, when the cyst is small, no treatment is neces- sary, and in others the swelling reappears so slowly after simple tapping that this alone is sufficient. Injection with strong tincture of iodine or with carbolic acid may bring about a cure, but the treatment does not seem so frequently successful in this as in the last form of hydrocele. If injection fail an incision should be made, and the cyst-wall either partially excised, or, if possible, completely enucleated. Encysted Hydrocele of the Body of the Testis.—This name has been ai)plied to cysts, usually small in size, which are very rarely met with in connexion with the body of the testis, where they lie between the tunica vaginalis and the tunica albuginea. In Astley Cooper's work a multilocular cyst of considerable size in this position is figured, but such a condition is exceedingly rare, and as a rule these cysts are of no practical importance. Hydrocele of the Spermatic Cord.—This occurs in two forms, the Encysted and the Diffused. Fig 947.—Spermatozoa from Encysted Hydrocele.

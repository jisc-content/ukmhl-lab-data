TREATMENT OF CONGENITAL TALIPES EQUINO-VARUS. 557 division of the tense structures at the inner border of the foot. This consists in making a free vertical incision across the inner border of the foot, over the position of the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, which is indicated by a fold in the skin due to the inversion of the foot. The incision is deepened to the bones and the astragalo-scaphoid joint freely opened. In this way all resist- ing structures can be freely divided, the most important being the two tibial tendons, the inner part of the plantar fascia, the front portion of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle, and the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. The tendo Achillis is divided subcutaneously. When the operation is completed Pig. 654.â€”Relation of Tendons at Ankle. A Tibialis Posticus. Point at wliicli cut.

The widely gaping wound is then carefully packed with antiseptic gauze and the foot fixed in suitable splints, preferably of plaster of Paris. Owen, who has strongly advocated this operation in suitable cases, recommends that the first . dressing should not be changed for ten days or a fortnight. The operation has been performed in several hundred cases by Phelps and others, but no death or serious accident has so far been recorded. The method should, however, be reserved for cases in which simpler measures have failed, but it certainly pre- sents advantages over many of the severe operations presently to be described'. Although, with the exception of the tendo AchiUis, individual tendons rarely

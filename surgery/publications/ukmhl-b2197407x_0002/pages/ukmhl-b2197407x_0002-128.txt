DISEjUSES of AliTEJlIES. 96 intervening spaces being filled up and the vessel converted into a rigid tube. In the early stages while the calcareous matter is arranged so as to form hues round the vessel, the condition is termed annular calcification (Fig. 440). When these lines have coalesced it is often called tubular calciftcatiori (Fig. 441). When this process has reached its highest stage, if the artery be remcned from the body and drawn through the fingers, a small rigid tube, composed of the calcified middle coat still lined by the inner coat, can be squeezed out, leaving the external coat apparently healthy. In fact, the toughness of the external coat is so little impaired that such a vessel can be tied, and even twisted, almost as safely as a liealthy artery. Annular and tubular calcifica- tions are almost invariably associated with chronic endarteritis and its secon- j dary degenerations in the larger vessels ; and in the intermediate arteries, such • as the axillary or popliteal, and sometimes even as low as the tibials, both conditions are observed side by side. ^ The existence of this degenerative change is usually recognized without f difficulty during life in any artery that can be examined with the finger. The . vessel feels hard and less compressible than natural. Its longitudinal elasticity is lessened, so that it is thrown into a wavy line when relaxed longitudinally . by flexion of the limb. _ • i i The morbid condition consists essentially of a deposit of lime salts in the 1 muscular fibre cells of the middle coat. We thus meet with it only in those vessels in which the muscular tissue is well developed. In the larger arteries -

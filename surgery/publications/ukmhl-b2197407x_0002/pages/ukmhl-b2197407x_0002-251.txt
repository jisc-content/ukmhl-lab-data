LIGATURE OF RADIAL AT WRIST. 219 The Radial Artery above the Wrist may be ligatured by making an incision about one and a half to two inches in length, a quarter of an mch outside the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis—the " directing Ime " (Fig. 493) ; after the division of the superhcial and deep fasciae, the artery accom- panied by its two veins will be exposed, and may be tied in the usual way. The artery lies between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and supinator longns, and is separated by some fat from the pronator quadratus. The Radial Artery in the middle of the Forearm can easily be ligatured by an incision made in a line drawn from the middle of the hollow in fi-ont of the elbow to the root of the styloid process (Fig. 493). At this part it is overlapped by the belly of the supinator longus, and lies on the insertion of the pronator teres. The incision should be about two inches in length ; after the fascia is divided the supinator comes into view, its internal edge must be found and the muscle turned outwards. A distinct fascia is found beneath it, on opening which jLcri. the artery will be seen with a vein on each side. The \ ^ radial nerve is about half an inch to the outer side, ""^^^^^^^ and is usually not seen. (^gfc|g|p|J||^ Ligature of the Radial Artery at the Wrist has ^"^^^^^^^ sometimes been done for aneurism of the palm, but is ^^^^'1^ more commonly required for wound. The artery at this )' part of its course lies deeply on the external lateral rig. 494.—Diagram of ligament of the wrist-joint. It winds round the lower FiLorSpfffiiis'^;'Ti end of the radius, passing beneath the extensor ossis '^'''■"^; artery, metacarpi and extensor brevis poUicis, and then under the extensor longus poUicis. The operation is performed by making an incision from the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb to the posterior part of the root of the styloid process of the radius in such a way as to be midway between the tendons of the long and short extensors of the thumb. In the superficial fat wiU be found the radial vein (which must not be mistaken for the artery) and some branches of the radial nerve, A fascia extending between the two tendons is then found and carefully opened, when the artery will be seen crossing the wound obliquely rather towards its lower end. This operation should never be performed in preference to that in front of the wrist, as it is more difficult and is apt to leave some stiffness in the tendons of the extensors of the thumb.

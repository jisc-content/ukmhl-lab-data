TREATMENT OF NECROSIS—REMOVAL OF SEQUESTRUM. 295 represented in Fig. 521. They are made with gouge ends, and hence may be termed gouge-forceps. I have found them extremely serviceable in many operations upon the bones. Care, however, should be taken not to remove more of the new case than is absolutely necessary, lest the ultimate soundness of the limb be endangered. In necrosis of the lower end of the femur the bone sur- rounding the sequestrum is often so peculiarly dense that it can be cut away so as to expose the dead bone only by the means of a chisel and mallet, used with considerable force. For the extraction of the sequestrum, the most convenient instrument is a pair of strong necrosis-forceps, well roughened at their ex- Fig. 518. Fig. 519. Fig. 520.

Occasionally the sequestrum is so shaped and placed that it cannot be seized with this in- strument ; in these circumstances it will be useful to drive a screw-probe into It, by which it may either be extracted, or so fixed as to admit of seizure and removal by the forceps. If the sequestrum be too large to be removed entire through the cloacas, it may perhaps best be extracted piecemeal, having been previously divided by passing the points of nai-row but strong cuttino- lorceps mto the interior of the bone. ^ After the removal of the sequestrum, a smooth hollow cavity will be left in the new case, from the bottom and sides of which blood usually wells un freelv issuing abundantly from the vascular bone, and from the granulations lining

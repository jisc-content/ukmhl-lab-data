This locarmalitnanov unassociated with any tendency to general infection is oft ra "emS^ feature of those growths. The tendency to recurrence may gradually we itsel out, and alter severa operations have been performed at intervars 1' months, or a year or two, the disease will cease to be reproduced. The result is not, however often so favourable. Instances are very numerous in which the ten- dency to local reproduction is so active that it outruns all possibility of complete extirpation, and eventually destroys the patient. In some instances the glands become implicated, and occasionally the tumour may exhibit general malig- nancy, secondary deposits being formed in the lungs and elsewhere In a case once under my care, I removed a sarcoma about the size of a hen's eo-o- from the mamma of a middle-aged unmarried lady. The tumour was drstinctly encapsuled, and was easily dissected out. It was soft in structure and yielded a glairy fluid from the cut surfiice, and was composed of lar^e oval and spindle-shaped cells with scarcely any intercellular substance. A few months after five small soft tumours sprang up around the cicatrix. The whole breast was then removed, but the patient died a year afterwards from a large secondary growth implicating the sternum. The Prognosis in Sarcoma of the Breast is always grave. Gross has collected the statistics of 1,00 cases, 91 of which were operated upon. In 42 of these recurrence occurred. In 6 the recurrence was in distant parts only; in 11 both locally and in distant parts, and in the remainder the disease returned as far ag was known in the region of the breast only. In S cases only of the lf)C> were the axillary glands affected. The Diagnosis of Sarcoma of the Mamma from the softer forms of fibro-adenoma is not possible in many cases before removal. It may be

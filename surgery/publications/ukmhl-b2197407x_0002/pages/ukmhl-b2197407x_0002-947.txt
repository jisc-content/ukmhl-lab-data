LAPAROTOMY FOR INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 915 intestines from the abdominal cavity. Three fingers of the right hand should be introduced, and the inner aspect of the umbilical, inguinal, femoral and obturator rmgs explored, and thus a small hernia, if present at either of these positions, detected. If nothing is found in this way, the plan which is usually adopted IS as follows : The fingers are passed to the region of the c^cum and Its condition determined. If it be distended, it proves that the ob- struction IS in the large intestine, and the fingers should explore the sigmoid flexure where possibly the cause of obstruction may be found, or if the gut IS empty it must be traced upwards. If the c^cum be collapsed, it proves that the obstruction is in the small intestine, and at the same time a tumour lowei pait of the ileum, or a constricting band at the brim of the pelvis. If, however, no such cause be found, the Surgeon should try to find the coll psed coils of gut below the obstruction, which, as Hulke'showed, of en reached ^ ' '^'^^^ '^''"^ "^"^ obstruction is des^lSd^'^^Epf'''°T?^' ' r'!^"'' ^^'''''^ fro^ that above IT I f ' introducing the hand, he advises that the coils of intestine which present at the wound should be carefully inspected by gently turnip. ^^^^^^^^ r v^^^^^^^' "gkZtdred coiJ, tnis IS followed in the direction of increasing distension and congestion " which, according to Greig Smith, will certainly lead to the obstruction Onl'v two fingers need be used for this manipulation oostruction.

This occurs principally in old people, from the accumu- lation ot flatus or of undigested matters, such as cherry-stones or the remains of a large meal of cabbage or spinach, in a coil of the gut. The solid nature ot the contents of the large intestine renders this part of the bowel especially lable to become obstructed, and for this reason incarceration chiefly aff'ects Jarge umbilical hernia which commonly contain part of the colon.

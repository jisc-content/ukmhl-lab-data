If all be going well, ordinary light diet such as milk-pudding, fish or chicken, may be allowed on the third or fourth day. Should there be much fever at any time, the application of an ice bladder to the head will soothe and tranquillize the patient, and promote re- duction of the temperature. As a rule the bowels may be left undisturbed until they show some inclination to act, when they may be assisted by an enema. Finally, the stitches should be removed on the seventh or eighth day, and the patient may be allowed to leave her bed at the end of the second week, wearing a suitable abdominal belt. After recovery from ovariotomy, the cure is usually complete. The removal of one, or possibly of both, uterine appendages may, in excep- tional instances of long-standing pelvic infiammatory troubles, justifiably be undertaken for the relief of persistent suffering associated with tangible disease of these organs. In such cases, the operation may prove to be of an exceed- ingly difficult and tedious nature, owing to the density and firmness of the adhesions in the pelvic cavity ; apart from this, however, the steps of the procedure required, and the details of the after-treatment, resemble in all essential features those above described in connexion with ovariotomy. Pelvic suppuration may be broadly divided, according to its seat of origin, into parametric (subserous) and iierimelric (intraperitoneal) formations of pus. A parametric abscess usually originates in the substance of an inflammatory •exudation developed between the folds of one or other broad ligament (pelvic cellulitis), or in a mass of haamorrhagic efiiision in the same situation (pelvic hsematocele). If allowed to accumulate, the pus may find its way into the adjacent bowel or the urinary bladder ; or, extending downwards, it may effect its escape through the vaginal vault; or, failing this, it may spread upwards towards the iliac fossa, ultimately pointing in the inguinal region or even over the iliac crest. Perforation of the abscess sac into the peritoneal cavity is an •extremely rare accident. The proper surgical treatment of parametric suppura-

The details of this operation are described later on as they are identical with those practised in the removal ot portions of nteLe f'or other causes. The death-rate among the V^^^^^^^^^ which this operation has been performed is high ; so it must not be licrhtly undertaken. If the patient suffers merely from a f^Bcal fistula, which can easily be controlled by a pad, it would evidently be unjustifiable o submit him to the risk of such an operation. If, however, the patient _i. otherwise in good health, but suffering great inconvenience from the artificial anus, and other means have failed, the operation holds out a fair prospect of relief and may be undertaken. -n v In comparing these two methods of treating an artificial anus it will be- found that resection and suture is more certain than the use ot the enterotome in its results, but is also attended Avith a higher mortality Thus of 111 cases collected by Korte in which the enterotome was used • 11 died and in 30 the operation failed ; whereas of 39 cases collected by Makins,' which were treated by resection, 1.5 died, and in 3 others the artificial anus was not cured. In both instances the mortality is much lower- than that which has hitherto followed the treatment of gangrenous gut by immediate resection and suture ; but it must be remembered, as Lockwood and Kendal Franks have very rightly insisted, that these secondary operations are perfovraed only on those patients who escape the many dangers resulting from the formation of an artificial anus—probably^ only 10 to 20 per cent of the whole number (see p. 854). tv i • Treatment of Strangulated Hernia by Aspiration.—Dieulafoy, m 1873, suggested that the reduction of a strangulated hernia might be effected

The rate of growth is slow, and fstia'endedwith retraction of the nipple or adhesion to the skin In some n tances more than one growth has been met with m the same breast Aveiy fr q^^^^^^^^^ is the%ccurrence of a blood-stained discharge from the nipple, which may be the first indication of the disease, and was present in five out of seven cases observed by Bowlby. The malignancy o the growth is low as compared with glandular carcinoma, and glandular infection is very rare. Local recurrence after removal has, however, been observed by Bnthn, glan- dular infection by Godlee, and a secondary tumour in the ribs by Shattock Of ten cases collected by Bowlby in which the age was mentioned, one occurred between 20 and 30, two between 30 and 40, two between 40 and 50, two between 50 and 60, and three between 60 and 70. Pathological Anatomy.—Th^ structure of villous cancer has been very fully described by Cornil and Ranvier. To the naked eye it may resemble encepha- loid cancer, and its section yields an abundant milky juice, but it differs from ordinary cancer in presenting numerous small cysts, some only just visible to the naked eye, and others an eighth of an inch or even more m diameter. In some specimens these cysts are filled with blood. Microscopic examination shows it to be composed of a well-formed fibrous stroma, containing spaces lined with an epithehum tending to assume a columnar form. Dehcate villous processes covered with epithelium project from this stroma into the spaces. These villi contain loops of capillary vessels which yield the blood so often found filling the spaces. It thus seems clear that the tumour may correctly be defined as a columnar carcinoma commencing in the epithelium of the ducts. The relation between duct cancer and duct papilloma (p. 780) is the same as that between papilloma and carcinoma of the rectum. The papilloma is a simple pedunculated tumour springing fi'om the wall of a dilated duct and occupying its lumen ; the duct cancer is no longer bounded by the duct wall, but invades the tissues around it. Chnically the two conditions are very similar, and it cannot be doubted that some cases described as duct cancers were in reality simple papillomata. In a case recently in University College

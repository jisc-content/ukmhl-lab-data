Congestive Stricture.—There can be no doubt that the two conditions of congestion and spasm are frequently associated in the urethra, m the relation of cause and effect; and this is the most frequent condition m which spasmodic strictures are found. Indeed, congestion plays an important part in all forms of stricture ; it may, as we have just seen, be connected with the spasmodic variety; it may occur alone ; or it may be associated with organic stricture. Some parts of the urethra appear to be more subject to congestion than others : thus, for instance, the membranous and prostatic portions, especially the folds of mucous membrane constituting the verumon- tanum, are pecuharly hable to become congested. Causes.—Congestive stricture frequently occurs as the result of chronic and long-continued inflammation of the urethra, or of the passage of con- centrated urine containing an undue proportion of urates. It is especially in gouty or rheumatic subjects who suffer from irritability of the skin^ and mucous membranes that this condition occurs. In these cases there is no permanent obstruction ; but the disease is transitory, and due solely to a .. swollen state of the membrane of the part. In the majority of cases, however, it comphcates and seriously aggTavates spasmodic and shght organic strictures. Symptoms.—In congestive stricture we not only find the common symptoms occasioned by an impediment to the free passage of the urine, but some swelling of the lips of the urethra, with reddening and eversion of them. There is also slight gleety exudation, and not unfrequently an abundant puriform discharge —in fact, urethritis of a marked kind, with a sense of weight or fulness in the perinseum, pain in micturition, and sometimes uneasiness in defsecation. This state of things constitutes a very troublesome affection, intimately connected with the various forms of urethritis, and exceedingly apt to relapse from apparently trivial circumstances, slight errors of diet, dyspeptic derange- ments, or any 16cal sources of irritation. The Treatment in these cases should consist in careful regulation of the diet and habits of life, and especially in the administration of citrate of

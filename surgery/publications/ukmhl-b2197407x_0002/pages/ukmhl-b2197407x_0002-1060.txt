I028 URINARY CALCULUS AND LITHOTOMY. rhubarb, which contain oxalates in considerable quantities, will cause their presence in the urine. It was formerly supposed to be associated with marked symptoms indicating the so-called oxalic diathesis, the patient being pale, hypochondriacal, dyspeptic, and sulfering from acidity of the stomach, dis- turbed sleep, and loss of sexual power. ^Roberts, however, states that oxaluria is accompanied by no constant train of symptoms, and asserts that the presence of oxalates furnishes no definite indication for treatment.

It forms no definite deposit, but is usually associated with a slight excess of mucus. The crystals adhere to the side of the glass in lines corresponding to any irregularity m the glass, or to marks left by the cloth used in wiping it out. There is strong reason to loelieve that in many cases the oxahc acid is produced during the early stages of decom- position after the urine has been passed. Oxalate of Lime Calculus. — The oxalate of lime or mulberry calculus is usually of a dark brown or even black colour, rough, tuberculated, and sometimes almost spiculated on the surface (Fig. 839). It is very heavy and hard. It seldom reaches a great size, as the irritation it causes calls attention to it early. Oxalic calculi of small size are not unfrequently passed as gravel. Treatment.—When the patient habitu- ally passes oxalates, and especially if they appear as gravel, he must be put upon a light and nourishing diet, especially the mineral acids, iron, zmc, and quinmc, may v , .^^^ ^er should, if possible, be changed for a time to a - - c "^^^^^^^^ ~ ^.^.e only must be used for drinking pui^oses. men c^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ is, owing to its roughness, usually a good deal of pam in the le^.io bladder, requiring the free administration of opiates.

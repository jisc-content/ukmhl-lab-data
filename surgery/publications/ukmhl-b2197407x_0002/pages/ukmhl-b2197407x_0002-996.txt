Recto-Vaginal Pistulae may arise from two causes : 1st, sloughin- of the recto-vagmal septum, in consequence of undue pressure exercised Spon it during parturition ; and 2nd, its perforation by syphilitic ulceration. Th^v may be ranged m two classes : those consisting of a button-hole opening (and these are often syphilitic), and those comphcated with more or less extensive laceration of the perm^Bum. The size of these fistulous openings when uncom- phca ed with rupture of the perineum, varies greatly ; in some cases there is merely a small perforation, in others there may be loss of the greater portion of the posterior wall of the vagina. Whatever their size, they are necessarily sources of very great discomfort and annoyance to the patient. The recogni- tion of the disease is easy ; the escape of the f^ces and flatus into the vagina being obvious, and examination with the finger or speculum at once detectino- the seat and extent of the aperture. As there is just the possibility of a com- munication existing between the vagina and the small intestine, it may be useful to bear m mind that, in this case, the matter that escapes is yellower and less sfcercoraceous than when the rectum is opened. The Treatment of the non-syphilitic fistula will vary according to the position of the aperture, and whether or not it is complicated with lacerated perinseum. If the fistula is high up in the recto-vaginal septum an attempt may be made to close it from the vagina. The opening having been fully exposed with retractors, the edges are freshened by dissecting away the sun-ounding tissue down to the rectal mucous membrane. Silver wire sutures are then inserted in such a way that they pass beneath the whole extent of the wound, and other superficial ones maybe made to include the mucous membrane only. Pozzi advises that the sutures be inserted in whichever direction there is the least tension, which in the case of a large opening is usually transversely.

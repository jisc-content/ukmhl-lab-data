The tumours usually affected one lobe only, but m a few cases the whole gland was implicated. The cancerous tumours were characterized by rapid growth, infiltration of neigh- bourmg structures, and early infection of the lymphatic glands and internal organs. In six cases, secondary tumours formed in the bones. The tumour was m all cases soft in consistence, and microscopic examination showed that the morbid growth commenced by proliferation of the normal cells of the gland, the new cells first filling the spaces and then burrowing into the surrounding parts in columns. The cells were in most cases polygonal, but in one the spaces were hned with cylindrical,epithelium. The sarcomata were round-celled, spindle-celled, and mixed. In one case the growth perforated the trachea, and in all secondary tumours appeared—in three cases in the lymphatic glands. A special form of malignant tumour of the thyroid body—known as " thyroid cancer "—has been met with in a few recorded cases in which the secondary tumours closely resembled the normal thyroid body in structure.

This has undergone various modifications and improvements at the hands of Mechani- dans and Surgeons. To Weiss in this country, and to Charriere m France wTLe especially indebted for having brought it to its present s ate 0 perfection In L eariier days of lithotrity Weiss's thumb-screw lithotrite was o-enerally used. Fergusson invented a rack-and-pmion instrument, Fig. 873.—Civiale's Lithotrite for Crushing Fragments. which, however, found little favour with Surgeons. Civiale's instruments having the double action of screw and hand pressure, were those to which many gave the preference until the invention of the cylindrical handle by Thompson. u v, 4. ^ ^ The lithotrite must be made of well-tempered steel; and should be tested Fig. 874.—Position of Hand in using Civiale's Lithotrite. by being made to crush apiece of sandstone grit, of about the size of a walnut. It should be of as full a size as the urethra will readily admit; it must have the male blade well serrated, and the female or under blade pierced at its root by an oval aperture, through which the detritus of the crushed stone is forced, and thus any jamming of it in the angle between the blades is prevented. The female blade should be considerably wider than the male to avoid nipping of the'mucous membrane of the bladder.

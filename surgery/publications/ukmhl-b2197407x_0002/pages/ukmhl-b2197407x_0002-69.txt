TREATMENT OF NEUROMA. 37 saiy to do something to relieve the patient, excision of the tumour is the only- possible mode of treatment. In idiopathic neuromata an attempt must always be made, by cautious dissection, to remove the tumour from the nerve, without cutting this across. This can be done in most cases without difficulty. If it is impossible to save the whole trunk, a few fasciculi may possibly be preserved which will maintain the continuity of the nerve and facilitate subsequent restoration. If complete division is unavoidable, an effort must be made to suture the divided ends after relaxing the parts as much as possible by position. If this be found impracticable on account of the length of nerve excised, the ends should be approximated as nearly as possible by several catgut sutures. Two methods deserve further trial in cases in which as the result of injury or the removal of a tumour an extensive gap is left in a nerve : viz., nerve graft- ing ; and suture of the distal end of the divided nerve into the trunk of a neigh- bouring uninjured nerve. The results of l&lling the gap by a piece of nerve taken from an amputated limb or from one of the lower animals have been very variable. In a case recorded by Mayo Robson an interval of two inches in the median nerve resulting fi'om the removal of a neuroma was filled by a piece of the posterior tibial nerve of an amputated leg. Eecovery was complete at the end of five months. It is doubtful whether the engrafted segment serves any other purpose than to guide the newly-formed nerve fibres from the upper to the lower portion of the divided trunk. The other method consists in carefully adjusting the distal end of the divided nerve by means of fine sutures to the trunk of a neighbouring nerve. Partial success has been recorded after this treatment. Traumatic neuromata of stumps are treated by excision.

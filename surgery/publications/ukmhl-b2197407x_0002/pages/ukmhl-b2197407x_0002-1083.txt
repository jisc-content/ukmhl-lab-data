I downwards over any resisting structures ; the left forefinger being placed at the middle of the wound, so as to protect the rectum. In this way the triangular space is opened between the accelerator urinse, the erector penis, and the trans- Tersalis perinfei muscles; and as the knife is carried downwards, the last-named muscle, the transversalis perin^i artery, and some areolar tissue are cut through. The lower border of the triangular ligament also is notched so as to open up the space between the two layers of the ligament, in which the membranous part of the urethra lies. The knife is then withdrawn, and the left index-finger is pushed deeply into this space until the edge of the nail is lodged in the groove of the staff, which can be felt just anterior to the prostate, thinly covered by the membranous portion of the urethra and the constrictor urethras muscle. The point of the knife is then pushed through the urethra at its membranous

In a case of « ^ ^ femoral hernia under my care, reduction was effected, but, strangulation recurring at the end of twelve days, an operation became necessary, and the patient died on the eighth day after it, or the twenty-first from the hrst strangulation. On examination, the small intestine was found congested in two portions, each of which was about eight inches in length ; several teet ot healthy gut intervening between them. One of these lay opposite the wound, and was evidently the intestine that was last strangulated. The other was altogether away from the seat of operation, but was equally darkly congested, being almost of a black colour, and was clearly that portion which had been constricted some time previously, and which, although twenty days had elapsed, had not as yet recovered itsplf. In more severe degrees of this condition, the paralysed segment of bowel acts as a complete block, and the symptoms continue with such urgency that only an exploratory operation can show whether or not a mechanical obstruction still exists unrelieved. The rule of practice which is usually adopted in such cases consists m exploring the region from which the hernia has been reduced. In the case of an inguinal hernia the first incision should be made so as to expose the external abdominal ring which, if reduction in mass have occurred, will be found peculiarly wide and open. The inguinal canal must next be laid open, and the parts contained within it carefully examined. If no appearance of a hernial sac be found, but the cord be distinctly and clearly seen, still further pre- sumptive evidence will be afforded of the reduction having been effected in

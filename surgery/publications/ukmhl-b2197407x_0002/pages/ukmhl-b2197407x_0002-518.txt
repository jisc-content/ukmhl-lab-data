DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 486 mater is not aflected, and the subsequent chauges in the cord are due to pressure only. The morbid process in the dura mater may extend backward'- on each side, but rarely forms a complete ring. The exact nature of the changes produced in the cord is not certain. According to Charcot a chronic inflammatory process occurs in the compressed segmentâ€”chronic transverse myelitis. It seems doubtful, however, whether myelitis occurs in all cases, and it is thought by some observers that the pressure causes anaemia followed by degenerative changes, and by others that a congested and oedematous con- dition results from the pressure on the veins and lymphatics. In any case secondary degenerative changes soon occur in the sensory tracts above tli^ affected segment and in the motor tracts below it. The effects of the chronic thickening of the dura mater, are, of course, not limited to the cord. The nerves passing through the diseased membrane also I Fi- 608 -Caries of Seventh Cervical and First Dorsal Vertehrie.

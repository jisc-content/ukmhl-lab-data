OPERATIVE TREATMENT, OF ENLARGED PROSTATE. ii49 instrument should be greater and longer than usual. ^ fj^fJ^^^^^^^^^ shaped prostatic catheter to be one the curve of ^^1^'^^. ^^^^^^^'J^ '^^^^^^^ the circumference of a circle five-and-a-half mches m diametei The eye <hould be large and rounded ; and I have found it of use to have tbe lo vei end of the stylet provided with a piston-plate so that by withdrawing tbs the mucus may be sucked in through the eye of the ^^^f , ^^J!^''"; ducing the catheter, care must be taken when the point enters the prostatic ureth?a to depress the handle well between the thighs while the -strument^^^^ drawn slightly towards the pubes, lest the end hitch against the enlarged middle lobe (Fig 006). If it be simply depressed, without at the same time being held back a little, it will probably tunnel the obstruction. In some cases the ordinary catheter passed in the same way will enter more easily than the prostatic. It is sometimes possible to lift the catheter over the obstruc- tion by pressing on it with the finger in the rectum. In fact, no one curve or one kind of instrument will answer in all cases. If it is necessary to use a rio-id instrument, I certainly think a silver instrument is safer and more easily managed than the gum-elastic. It might be supposed that less chance of mischief would result from the gum-elastic than from the metahic catheter, as being the softer and more yielding instrument ; but this is erroneous, if the stylet be allowed to remain in, as it is then as rigid at the point, as hard, and as hkely to penetrate soft structures as a silver one would be. The commencement of catheterization in cases of enlarged prostate cannot be regarded as altogether free from risk. The patient is liable to an attack of fever such as may follow the introduction of an instrument for other purposes, and the precautions mentioned at p. 1125 must be care- fully observed. Exposure to cold is especially to be avoided after the catheter has been used. Before the instrument is passed, the patient should empty his bladder as completely as possible, in order that the amount of the residual urine may be ascertained. If this be about three or four ounces the bladder should be emptied every morning and evening, whilst if this amount be much exceeded the catheter must be passed three or four times in the twenty-four hours. The patient should use a soft catheter if possible, and the Surgeon must give careful directions concerning the cleansing of the instrument. In cases complicated with severe cystitis and great irritability of the bladder which have resisted simpler treatment, drainage of the bladder may be the only means of saving the patient from fatal exhaustion or septic poisoning. This may most readily be done by introducing a tube through ah incision into the membranous urethra (p. 1119) ; or suprapubic cystotomy may be- performed, as first practised by Thompson in 1869, the opening being main- tained by a gum-elastic catheter fitted with a silver shield, and provided with a rubber bottle to receive the urine. The suprapubic method has the advantage of allowing a thorough investigation of the bladder and prostate,^ but it is only available if the patient's condition is favourable. Operative Treatment of Enlarged Prostate.â€”Various operative pro- cedures have been proposed from time to time for the relief of difficult micturition from enlarged prostate or bar at the neck of the bladder. One of the first of these was Mercier's operation of division of the bar at the neck of the bladder by means of an instrument shaped like a lithotrite, the male blade of which was represented by a concealed knife. Mercier also devised another

The Ueatment consists in retaining it with a pessary.; a radical cure by operation has been successfully accomplished. Pudendal Hernia was described by Astley Cooper as closely resembhng vao-inal rupture. It forms a swelling in the posterior part of the labmm maVs It can be distinguished from an inguinal hernia by the anterior part of the labium and the external abdominal ring being free. The distmction between pudendal hernia and cyst of the labium can hardly be attended witli any diflSculty. The treatment consists in the use of a special truss or a ^^Sciatic Hernia.—This rare form of hernia was described by Astley Cooper as passing through the sciatic notch between the lower border of the pyriform muscle aSd the spine of the ischium. It lies in close relation with the sciatic nerve, and with the internal iliac vessels. In the case related by Cooper, the obturator artery passed above, and the vein below the neck of the sac. From the depth at which such a hernia would be seated, and its small size, it would probably escape observation during life ; but, if detected, it might readily be retained by means of proper bandages and a pad. Should operation ever be required, laparotomy and reduction from within the abdomen would probably be the safest proceeding. DIAPHEAGMATIC HERNIA. Congenital defect of the Diaphragm is occasionally met with. It has consisted, in most of the recorded cases, of an aperture in this membrane, varying in diameter from an inch upwards ; and amounting, in some rare instances, even to an entire absence of one or both wings of the diaphragm. Through these openings, the contents of the abdomen have been protruded ; the stomach and small intestines being most frequently displaced, and the spleen and liver having been fcrund in the chest in a tolerably large proportion of the cases. The hernia has mostly been observed in children at or soon after birth ; but in several instances the subjects have lived to adult age, the hernia at last taking place apparently accidentally. In some of these latter cases, however, it may be a question whether the opening in the diaphragm was not the result of an accident, perhaps some time antecedent to the occur- rence of the hernia. The opening has generally been found on the left side ; sometimes, however, on the right. Diaphragmatic hernia is sometimes of traumatic origin, being the result

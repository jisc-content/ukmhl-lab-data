An important feature, which is common to them IIms that they are perfectly encapsnled, and are not intimately connected -pie gWular tumours of the breast is the ^Tl^.^^. Microscope examination of this rax. tumour shows a.m Led with abundant epithelium, presenting much_ the appearance of the Tormal gland during lactation. Small ducts connecting several acmi may be present, but there are no large collecting ducts, as m the normal mamma. In some cases cysts, formed by the dilatation of the acim, have been present From this single type it is easy to pass by a gradual transition to .eveial other tumours, which, although they may differ widely from one anothei m their superficial characters, have this essential feature in common that they consist of epithelium-hned glandular spaces lying in a connective tissue '''^Thus, if the bulk of the tumour consists of dense fibrous tissue in which the glandular spaces are more or less abundantly scattered (Vol. 1., J^ig. ^74j, the Growth is termed a ribro-adenoma. The glandular spaces may retain their resemblance to normal acini, but often they are dilated mto small cysts, or form flattened sht-hke spaces which branch irregularly through the fibrous stroma. ■ l >. r. In another common modification the tumour presents a minute structuie exactly corresponding to that last described, with the single exception that the stroma, instead of being represented by dense fibrous tissue, is richly cellular, and may indeed be almost entirely embryonic, every vanation between the two extremes being met with (Vol. L, Fig. 375). Thus, it may be composed of small spindle-cehs with numerous fibres between them ; of imperfectly developed fibrous tissue infiltrated with small round or large spmdle-cells ; of delicate fibres with stellate cells and mucous intercellular substance ; or of various modifications of these structures. Such a tumour may most correctly be called a Soft Fibro-adenoma. Much confusion has arisen from the use of the name Adeno-sarcoma for this tumour, which is only a rapidly growing fibro-adenoma. The last variety of the adenomatous tumours of the breast is characterized VOL. II. ^ ^

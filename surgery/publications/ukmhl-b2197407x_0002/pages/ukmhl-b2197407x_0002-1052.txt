It It be pyonephrosis, the pus has usually a peculiar sickly smell, especially if It be tuberculous. In calculous pyelitis it is sometimes ofl^ensive from decom- position which has spread up from the bladder. This is far less common in tubercu ous pyelitis. All renal abscesses may acquire a facal smell when thev approach very near to the colon. The lobulated form and great size of the cystic kidney and the absence of haematuna would probably serve to indicate its nature. Profuse hematuria following the examination is suggestive of malignant disease. In some cases of large accumulations of calculi, grating has been felt during manipulation Xhe above, taken m connexion with the symptoms already described, will usually enable the Surgeon to determine the nature of a renal tumour with sutticient accuracy. NEPHRECTOMY. By N-ephrectomy is meant the complete extirpation of the kidney, an operation which a few years since would have been considered as unsound in physiological principle as impracticable to surgical art. Before proceeding to the removal of the kidney, it was necessary to ascertain that a person could not only live, but that the health might be maintained, after the removal of so important an organ. That this is possible has been proved by the result of injury, by pathological research, and by physiological experiment. There are cases on record in which, in consequence of a deep stab or cut in the loin, one kidney has been wounded and forced out of the wound, whence it has been removed after ligature of its pedicle, the patient making a good recovery. Then, again, it has long been known to pathologists that a person may live with one kidney practically useless, either blocked by calculus, destroyed by suppuration, or converted into a mere sac in hydronephrosis. Simon, of Heidelberg, proved by numerous experiments on dogs that one kidney might be extirpated without danger, and that the animal enjoyed perfect health afterwards. The ground having thus been cleared, Gustav Simon was encouraged to undertake the operation for the extirpation of one kidney. This he did in 18(59, in the case of a woman who, having had the ureter cut across in the operation of ovariotomy, was left with a urinary listula otherwise incurable. The kidney, which was healthy, was removed by a lumbar incision. The

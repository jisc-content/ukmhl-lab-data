That this is the case in certain acquired cases is undoubted, but there is no evidence that these nerves are m any way affected in cases of congenital club-foot. In considering the subject of club-foot, it will be convenient to describe Fig. 645.- Talipes Equinus.

Congenital Club-foot.—Any of the varieties of club-foot which have been enumerated above may be present at birth, but of all forms, talipes equine- Fig. 647.—Talipes Varus.

Causation.—Three chief theories have been brought forward in explanation of. congenital club-foot. According to one view the deformity is due to changes in the nervous system which give rise to spasm or paralysis of certain groups of muscles. This explanation is doubtless correct in some cases, especially in those in which the deformity is associated with spina bifida, but it seems quite

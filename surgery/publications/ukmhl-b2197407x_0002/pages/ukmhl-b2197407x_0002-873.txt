The best enema is one of gruel and castor-oil w th some spirits ot turpentine added to it; it should be injected through a ^-^^'^^^f^^^l high up into the gut, and with a moderate degree of force. In administering it tare^must be taken that no injury be done to the bowel. It would scarcely be necessary to give such a caution as this, were it not that I was once sum- moned by two very excellent practitioners, to see a woman with strangulated hernia, to whom an enema of about two quarts of tepid water had been administered ; and as this had not returned, and did not appear to have gone up the bowel, they suspected that it must have passed out of the rectum into the surrounding areolar tissue. As the patient, however, did not seem to be suflPering from this cause, and as the symptoms of strangulation were urgent, I operated on the hernia. Death suddenly occurred, apparently from exhaus- • tion, in about eight hours ; and it was found that the rectum had been per- forated, and the fluid injected into the meso-rectum, separating the gut from the sacrum, whence it had extended into the general subperitoneal areolar tissue ; some of the water appeared to have entered the peritoneal cavity also. _ The ice-bag may safely be tried in some cases of this nature, and m very large hernise reduction has been effected by the uniform pressure of an elastic bandage passed several times round the tumour. Persistence of Symptoms after Reduction.—After the reduction of the hernia by taxis, the symptoms of strangulation may continue unabated. This may arise from the following conditions : 1. The hernia may have been reduced in mass. 2. An internal strangulation has existed within the sac, the taxis having overcome the external stricture, but failing to influence that withm. 3. The gut may have been so severely nipped or strangulated for so long a time, that as soon as the constricrion of the vessels is relieved, the phenomena of acute inflammation manifest themselves, with complete arrest of peristaltic movement. This condition, as before stated, may end in gangrene. 4. The sac may be of an hour-glass shape, lying partly within the abdomen and partly outside, and in the apparent reduction the gut may have been merely squeezed

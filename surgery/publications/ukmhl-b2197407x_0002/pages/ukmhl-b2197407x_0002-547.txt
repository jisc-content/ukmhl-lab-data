TUMOURS OF MUSCLE. 515 trichina spiralis, the embryos of which become encysted in the interior of the muscle fibres. The cysts, which appear as minute white oval spots, were first discovered by Paget in 1834. The muscles chiefly affected are the diaphragm, the intercostals, and those of the neck and larynx. Of twelve consecutive cases that I have had under my care in which tumours of different kinds developed primarily in muscular tissue, the following are the particulars. The first case was that of a woman about 48 years of age, in whom a fibro-cystic tumour, as large as a cocoa-nut, developed in connexion with the tensor vaginse femoris, forming a large mass, which I easily dis- sected out. The second case was that of a lad about 18, in whom a thick- Fig. 616.â€”Fibro-Sarcoma of the Sartorius Muscle. walled cystic tumour, as large as a foetal head, and containing clear fluid, developed in the substance of the adductor brevis, from which it was dissected out with no little difficulty, and with a fatal result. The third case was that of a man from whom the accompanying drawings are taken (Figs. 61G, 617, G18), in whom a fibro-sarcoma developed in the substance of the sartorius muscle of the left thigh, in consequence of a strain. After growing slowly for about six years, it had attained the size of a child's head, when I removed it, together with seven or eight inches of the muscle from the inside of the sheath ot which it had originated. The sheath of the femoral vessels, which was ' xposed for a considerable extent, was unaffected by the disease.

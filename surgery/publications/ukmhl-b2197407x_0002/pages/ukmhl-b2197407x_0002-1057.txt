1025 URINARY DEPOSITS AND CALCULI. CHAPTER LXVII. URINAEY CALCULUS AND LITHOTOMY. URINABY DEPOSITS AND CALCULI. The urine is liable to deposit various solid matters, which when impalpable are termed Sediments; when in fine gritty particles, Gravel; and when forraino- a larger concrete mass. Calculus or Stone. These deposits may be the result of constitutional abnormality, and the conditions givmg rise to them are then sometimes termed a Diathesis. Much importance was for- merly ascribed to these so-called diatheses, as it was believed that there was some definite constitutional condition corresponding to each form of urinary deposit; but this view can no longer be maintained. Uric Acid Deposits.—These occur in two forms : as free uric acid and as urates. Free uric acid, in the form of crystals, is never met with in healthy urine. When it forms a deposit it appears as small red grains which may be compared in general appearance to cayenne pepper. Under the microscope it Fig. S35.—Uric Acid. Fig. 83(3.—Urate of AmmoniiTm and Amorphous Urates. is found to be crystalKne. The form of the crystals varies considerably ; most commonly they appear as smooth, transparent, rhomboidal plates, mixed with which may be diamond-shaped, prismatic, or needle-shaped crystals. Occasionally they are barrel-shaped (Fig. 835). As a rule they are darkly stained with urinary pigment, and present a reddish colour, but the tint varies greatly in different cases. The crystals are readily soluble in dilute solutions of potash or soda. Urates form the common pale yellow or reddish-yellow deposit which is so frequently observed to form as urine cools after being passed. This deposit is amorphous, and has no very definite chemical composition, consisting of uric acid,'combined with sodium, potassium, and ammonium in varying proportions, VOL. IL 8 u

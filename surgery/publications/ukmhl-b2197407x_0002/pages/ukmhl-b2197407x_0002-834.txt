In all cases the age of the patient, the rapidity of growth of the tumour, and the presence or absence of spontaneous pain or tenderness on examination, must be taken into account. Such evidence may be useful but the cases of real difficulty are just those in which, as often happens, none ot these points is opposed to or supports any particular diagnosis. It cannot be too strongly insisted that no affection of the breast is more often painless tnan cancer in its early stages.

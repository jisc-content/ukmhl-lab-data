The merit of introducing this plan of treatment into surgical practice is due to Brodie Boyer had previously recommended that the sphincter should be cut com- pletely across, in order that its action might be paralysed ; but Brodie found that the ulcer could be made to heal as readily by the limited incision above mentioned. The operation is done by introducing the left forefinger into the rectum, guiding along it a straight probe-pointed bistoui-y, and then cutting downwards and outwards, carrying the knife about the eighth of an mch m depth. No dressing is required after this operation ; but, if the mcision do not readily heal, it should be touched with nitrate of silver. The patient's bowels should be well opened before the operation, and a dose of castor-oil may be given on the second or third day after it. During the process of cicatrization it will often be advantageous to give iron, and to put the patient on a nourishing diet. As a substitute for incision, forcible digital dilatation of the anus under an anassthetic has of late been extensively practised with very good results. The floor of the fissure is usually torn somewhat deeply, so that the effect resembles that of incision. In a considerable number of cases Ball has obtained equally good results by simply snipping off with scissors the small "pile " at the lower end of the fissure

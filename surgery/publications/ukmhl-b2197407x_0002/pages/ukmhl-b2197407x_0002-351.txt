3'9 SABCOMA OF BONE: DIAGNOSIS. aspirator. Even when the presence of a tumour is evident, it is not always easy to make sure that it is attached to the bone. Examination under chloroform, with complete relaxation of the muscles, will usually, however, overcome this difficulty. A consolidated aneurism has been mistaken for a sarcoma of bone, and ampu- tation has been performed on this supposition, as in the case represented in Fig. 450. The opposite error has, however, more often been made, a soft pulsating sarcoma being taken for an aneurism. The distinction between these diseases has already been given at p. 112. Having ascertained the presence of a tumour, it remains to determine the Fig. 535.—Peripheral Spin- Fig. 536. — Peri- dle-celled Sarcoma of Shaft of pheral Spindle-celled Femur sawn open.

If the tumour is of slow growth, very firm, of considerable size, lobulated on the surface, very clearly defined, and immovably fixed to the bone, it may be a simple chon- droma. If, with the same symptoms, however, it is of more rapid growth, it may be a sarcoma developing into cartilage. The distinction is very impor- tant if it can be made, for a simple chondroma is an innocent tumour, and the Surgeon in removing it may carry his knife close to the growth, but a chondri- fying sarcoma is usually very malignant, and amputation must be done high above it. Unfortunately the distinction is often impossible. When the tumour 18 central and situated at an articular end of a long bone, especially the upper end of the tibia, the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the humerus or the lower end of the ulna, or in the lower jaw, the chances are greatly m favour of its being a myeloid sarcoma.

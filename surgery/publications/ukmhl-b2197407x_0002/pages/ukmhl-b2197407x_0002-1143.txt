CXSTITIS. \cuTB Cystitis is of frequent occurrence, and arises from many different causes In many instances it is met with merely as a complication of some serious disease of the bladder, such as calculus or tumour, _ Cau3es.-Acute cystitis may result from various forms of injury such as occur during operations on the bladder or during parturition or from the irritation caused by fragments of a broken calculus or by other foreign bodies loda-ed in its interior. The best example of cystitis resulting from the pre- sence of a chemical irritant in the urine is that following the external or internal administration of cantharides. A mild form is described as being sometimes produced by partaking to excess of sour wme or new beer, io the same category probably belong at least some of the cases in which mild symptoms of cystitis occur in children who habitually pass urme which is highly acid or loaded with phosphates. \pUc cystitis includes a large proportion of the cases of acute inflammation of the bladder which are met with in practice. It results from simple putre- factive changes occurring in the bladder as a consequence of the introduction of septic micro-organisms from without. As predisposing causes of septic cystitis the presence of retained urine in the bladder and chronic congestion or inflammation of the mucous membrane are most important. The intro- duction of septic matter is most commonly brought about by the use of an im- perfectly cleaned catheter ; but independently of this it seems probable that infection may occur along the urethral canal, especially when the latter is imperfectly closed and filled with adherent mucus. Such conditions are doubt- less sometimes present, more particularly when the bladder is completely paralysed a^ the result of injury of the spinal cord. In the female the entrance of septic matter along the short urethral canal is the most probable explanation of the frequency of cystitis without obvious cause in that sex.

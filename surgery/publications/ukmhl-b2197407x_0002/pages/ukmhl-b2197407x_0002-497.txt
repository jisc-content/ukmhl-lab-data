EXCISION OF ASTRAGALUS. The operation of excision of the whole of the astragaJus for disease may be done as foUows. A curved incision, from four to six inches in length, should be made immediately behind the outer malleolus, and carried forward on the outer part of the dorsum of the foot to opposite the fore part of the bone. The divisions of the external lateral ligament of the ankle-joint are then cut across, and the tendons of the peroneus brevis and tertius, and the extensor brevis digitorum muscle, divided. But the mass of extensor tendons in front of the foot, with the dorsalis pedis artery, must be left untouched. These should be drawn forcibly inwards. The peroneus longus tendon may be drawn backwards. The foot is then strongly twisted inwards, the astragalas cleared, Fig. 597.â€”Excision of Astragalus. 1. Foot before Operation. 2.

When the operation is done for disease of the bone, these structures will usually be more or less softened and disorganized ; when for injury, they will in a great measure have been torn through. Hence, in actual operation, the same steps cannot be followed so methodically as may be done on the dead subject. The bone must now be seized with lion-forceps and drawn well out of its bed ; the knife being applied to any restraining structures, but being used very carefully towards the inner side of the bone, lest the plantar arteries be wounded. Under this process the carious bone usually breaks and has to be taken away piecemeal, or its neck may be cut across, and the head separately removed from its articulation with the scaphoid. If the bone have been dislocated, and its ligamentous connexions VOL. II H H

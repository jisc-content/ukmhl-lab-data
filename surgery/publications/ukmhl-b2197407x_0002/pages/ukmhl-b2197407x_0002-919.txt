VENTRAL HERNIA. 887 For the radical cure of umbilical hernia the plan ■. mo.^ efficient Two curved incisions are made, which meet above anc Deiow mtdl ne .'^d include the greater part of the skin ^-^^^^^^^ e tumour being turned first to one side and then to ^he ^^^^ ^ X d •n-e made The wound is next deepened on one side and the skm lenecitu m the base of the swelling until the aponeurosis is exposed 3- ^^/^^^^^^^ nook of the hernia. The same process is continued completely around the Dase tl he nia ' When this has been done, the hernia, covered by the perfectly ndisturbed skin will be entirely isolated from all the tissues outside the ^^dtm^n id ^.^^^^ be attached only by its neck." The margin of the opening nSnetosIs is clearly defined' The sac is next opened - a^y P^^^^^^^^^ appears to be free from adhesions and the contents reduced ; if —^he <menino- must be enlarged in the middle l.ne above and below When the sac ha been emptied, the opening into the abdomen is p ngged wx^h a sponge a^^^^ the sac .vith its coverings is excised at the edge of f .^^^J^^^^^^^^^^ then closed with sutures of silkworm-gut, introduced with a ^^^^^^ Hage^o;^^ needle and made to include the aponeurosis and the peritoneum. The sutuies ^htld aU be introduced before any are tied, and wMlst they are being passed the intestines must be held back with a broad spatula. Finally the skin wound is completely closed with sutures. The dressing should be covered with several broad strips of plaster, and an abdominal belt should be worn foi at least several months after the operation. Under no circumstances should an umbilical hernia be opened by a median incision, for the coverings are thinner here than elsewhere and the contents more frequently adherent to the sac. The free removal of omentum is almost always necessary, especially as it is usually extensively adherent to the sac. In dealing with adherent intestine it is wiser to return the piece of the sac to which the" gut is fixed into the abdomen than to run any risk of damaging the gut in dissecting it away. VENTRAL HERNIA. By Ventral Hernia are meant those protrusions of the intestine that occur through any part of the abdominal wall, except the inguinal, the femoral, or the umbihcal apertures ; they most commonly occur in the mid-line between the recti muscles, the linea alba appearing to have given way in this situation during parturition ; and here they may attain an immense size. A case was once sent to me in which there was a long triangular gap through the upper part of the abdominal wall, extending from the umbilicus to the ensiform cartilage, through which a protrusion had taken place that was nearly as large as an adult's head. These ruptures have also been met with in the line« semilunares, and in the hypochondriac and iliac regions. When these hernige form in the vicinity of the stomach, they are apt to occasion dyspeptic symptoms and much gastric irritation. These different protrusions have occasionally been met with as the result of injuries, by which the anterior abdominal wall has been lacerated ; indeed they seldom take place below the umbilicus, unless arising from a directly traumatic cause, such as an ovariotomy wound. It is by no means uncommon to meet with fatty tumours, sometimes of considerable size, in the linea alba above the umbilicus. They consist of

A manceuvre mentioned by Brodie will often be of use in surmounting a large middle lobe : viz., after passing the gum-elastic catheter as far as it will go, to withdraw the stylet slightly, so as to tilt up the point of the catheter, which then shps over the obstacle. If none of the foregoing means succeed, the Surgeon must have recourse to silver instruments. If the prostate be much enlarged it may be necessary, in order to reach and empty the bladder, to use a prostatic catheter. This instrument should be of large size, about No. 12. In order properly to enter the bladder, which is carried away from the surface by the elongated urethra, the prostatic catheter should be about four inches longer than an ordinary one ; and, as the neck of the viscus is usually pushed up high behind the pubes by the projection upwards of the lateral lobes, the curve of che

i^So DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. which are clearly visible to the iiakedfli eye, and can be picked out of a thick section with a needle. It has been suggested that these columns of caiti- lage are lying in dilated lymphatics, but careful microscopic examination sug- gests rather that they are formed by ■ chondrification of the embryonic matrix. The matrix in other cases may assume a myxomatous form, the intercellulai substance being mucous in appearanc!; and the cells stellate in form. In maij\ cases the intercellular substance sprouts up into the cysts, forming intra-cystic growths still covered with epithelium. These tumours are usually simple and a distinctly encapsuled, but in some cas'-^ they became malignant. This may occur from an exuberant growth of the embryonic tissue of the stroma, or, according to Rindfleisch, actual can- cerous transformation may take place, the stroma assuming the form of a cancer stroma and the epithelium of the spaces taking on the -active growth of a true carcinoma. Many of these variations may occur in different part.s of the same growth. Symptoms.—These tumours are most common in young adults or middle- Pig. 954.—Adenoma of the Testicle. The external covering is the tunica vaginalis ; the next layer is the tunica albuginea; the thin imperfect layer under this is the tubular substance of the testicle spread out oxev the true capsule of the tumour.

They cause a steady increase in the size of the testicle, unaccompanied by paiu or tenderness. Their growth is of varying rapidity, but they often take a year or more to attain 4

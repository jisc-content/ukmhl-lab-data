So, also, if the patient be cachectic and broken in health more especially if he be suffering from tuberculous disease of the lungs, t is well to improyp his constitutional powers before undertaking an operation, lest the wound that results may not heal. The most important question connected with the operation for fistula, is the propriety of performino- it in tuberculous subjects in whom the disease is especially apt to occur. The co-existence of fistula with pulmonary phthisis was at one time believed to retard the progress of the latter disease. I have, however, in several cases round considerable advantage result fi-om operating for fistula in the early stages of phthisis, or m suspected cases of that disease, the patient's health having considerably improved after the healing of the fistula. But in advanced phthisis, no operation should ever be practised ; as the wound will not heal and the patient must be weakened by the additional discharge, rn, , operation for comple/e fistula should be performed in the following way : ihe bowels having been well cleared out the day before with a dose of castor-

Section of Globus minor: ami d. Cord. patches of healthy tubular substance are found at various parts of the organ. A process of cicatricial contraction taking place in these fibroid processes may lead to a dimpling of the surface of the organ. The microscope shows that the change is due to an inflammatory small round-celled growth, which after- wards undergoes a development into a dense fibroid tissue, situated in the connective tissue between the tubuU seminiferi (Fig. 952). The new growth separates and presses on the tubules, and may cause their destruction m large areas. The Guminatous Form is an aggravation of that just described, and presents the same symptoms, with the addition of those caused by the presence of the gummata. These form hard craggy nodules on the surface of the gland, the irregularities so produced being much greater than those arising from simple fibroid induration. The gummata have little tendency to soften, and discharge externally ; yet in rare cases they may do so. Structure.—On making a section of a gland in this condition, more or less of the fibroid induration, above described, will always be found combined with thickening of the tunics of the testicle. The gummata vary in size, from a pea to a hazel-nut. They are of an opaque yellow colour, irregular

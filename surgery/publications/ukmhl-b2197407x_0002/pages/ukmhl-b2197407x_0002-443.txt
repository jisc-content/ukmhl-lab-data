ACUTE ARTHRITIS OF TEE HIP. 411 helpless, and motionless; the nates will be found flattened, and there is usually some fulness about the anterior part of the joint, or to its outer side, in the hollow behind the trochanter. There is also theoretically true elongation of the limb, in consequence of the capsule becoming distended with fluid, and pushing the head of the bone downwards, but this seldom, if ever, occurs to such an extent as to be recognizable by measurement. On measuring in order to ascertain the true length, it is necessary to examine the two limbs together, and to place the sound in exactly the same position as the diseased one ; unless this be done, error will very probably creep in, for, on measuring the lower extremity from the anterior superior iliac spine to the lower border of the patella or the inner ankle, Fig. 565.â€”Acute Arthritis of Hip-joint in an Adult.

In some cases the distension of the capsule with synovial fluid, as the result of the inflammation in the joint, may be so great as to lead to its rupture, and to the sudden dislocation of the head of the bone on to the dorsum ilii, with great pain and much shortening ; this, however, is of very rare occurrence, the dislocation seldom taking place until after abscess has formed within the joint, and the articulation has been thus destroyed (Fig. 565). ^ The Result of acute arthritis of the hip depends greatly upon the constitu- tion of the patient, the cause of the inflammation, and the manner in which it is treated. In the most favourable circumstances, as the inflammation subsides, the disease falls into the subacute condition, and recovery gi-adually but very slowly takes place, with a limb that continues stiff and partially

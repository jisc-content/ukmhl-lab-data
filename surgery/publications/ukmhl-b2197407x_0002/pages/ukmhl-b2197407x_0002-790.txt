The Icrer border of the sixth rib is then felt for, and if a L^, 8 being used a small incision may be made through the skin, parallel to it in the mid-axillary line. The point chosen should correspond to the intoi^vaJ between two digitations of the serratus magnus. If the aspirator is bein!. used no mcieion is required. The skin is then drawn upwards till the point Chosen m the skin corresponds to the upper border of the rib, and the point 01 the trochar is then slipped over its margin and thrust sharply and firmlv into the pleural sac, so as to make sure of penetrating the thickened pleura and any layer of false membrane, which if the instrument were pushed Fig. 773.â€”Tapping the Chest by the Bottle-Aspii-ator. slowly on, might be thrust before it. By thus passing the trochar immediately above the rib any risk of wounding the intercostal artery or nerve is avoided, while by drawing up the skin before so doing the superficial opening and that in the intercostal muscles and pleura do not correspond and thus the track of the trochar is eflficiently closed. After the withdrawal of the cannula the puncture is covered with some dry cotton-wool and collodion, or by a piece of adhesive plaster, and will usually unite without trouble. If the aspirator is used the details described iii Vol. I., p. 24:b, must be attended to. It must be remembered that when the vacuum is moderately perfect the lung is being expanded by the pressure of the atmosphere with a force equal to fifteen pounds to the square inch. This may possibly cause some injury by rupture of adhesions, and even cause hsemorrhage from the lung. If therefore the patient complains of severe pain after a certain amount of fluid has been withdrawn, or if the fluid becomes blood-stained, the

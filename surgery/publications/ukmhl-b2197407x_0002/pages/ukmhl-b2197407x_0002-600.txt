DISEASES OF THE SCALP AND SKULL. ^ The Scalp is subject to all those surgical diseases that affect the common iuteg-ument of the body. But it is more than any oj^her part of the surfac.- liable to two diseases, viz., Atheromatous Cysts and Ngevi. These have already been so fully Dreated of (Cysts, Vol. I., p. 1006, Nsevi, Vol. I., p. 1028, and Vol. IF., p. G')) that their description here would lead to needless repetition. Pachydermatous Tumour of the Scalp or Molluscum Fibrosum (Vol. I., p. lOi;)). This disease, of rare occurrence, was fii'st described by John Bell, subsequently by Valen- tine Mott as Pachydermaiocele, and more recently by Virchow as Fibroma Molluscum. The accompanying cut (Fig. G62), taken from a patient whilst In America, who was after- wards successfully operated on by W. Stokes, in Dublin, gives a good representation of the disease. These tumours are neither painful nor dangerous, but their weight and the deformity occasioned by them render their removal desirable. Treatment.—The removal of this tumour has been effected by the ligature and by the knife. Pollock has successfully extirpated one by the former, "W". Stokes and others by Fig. 662.—Molluscum Fibrosum of Scalp. the latter method. But the Opera- tion is not without danger. In Stokes's case the hEemorrhage was described as terrific, nearly costing the patient his life, and had to be arrested by the cautery. Stokes states tliai in the whole course of his experience he had never seen such copious and uncontrollable " weeping " hfemorrhage ; it came from every point of the cut surface. Fungus of the Dura Mater.—Sometimes without apparent cause, at other times following a blow or fall, a Fungous Tumour grows from some part of the dura mater, usually on the top of the head or in one of the parietal

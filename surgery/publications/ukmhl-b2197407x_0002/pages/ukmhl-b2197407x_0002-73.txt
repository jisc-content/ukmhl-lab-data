ELEPHANTIASIS ARABUM. the lower extremity, the disease has received the name, " Barbadoes Leg." Only a very brief description of its principal features can be given here. When the disease attacks the lower extremity it is usually confined to the parts below the knee, but the whole limb may be alfected. The enlargement of the limb may be enormous, the hypertrophied tissues being thrown into large folds separated by deep sulci. The skin itself is much thickened, and as the result of hypertrophy of the papillge presents a coarse velvety or warty appearance (Fig. 422). In elephantiasis of the scrotum the tumour may reach enormous proportions, Fig. 422.—Elephantiasis Arabum of Lower Limb. forming a tumour nearly as large as the trunk, and perhaps weighing 70 or 80 lbs., or even, as in one recorded case, as much as 224 lbs. The disease is rarely seen in this country, though Liston once had occasion to remove such a mass weighing 44 lbs. The tumour forms a pear-shaped mass covered with coarse warty skin. The penis is usually completely buried in the upper and front part of the tumour, whilst the testicles lie posteriorly in the lower half. Large hydroceles are usually present. Fig. 423 represents a tumour of this kind, weighing 40 lbs., which was successfully removed by Rogers of the Mauritius. It is taken from a photograph of the case, kindly sent to me by that gentleman. When the disease affects the labia or other parts, the changes produced are similar to those in the lower limbs and scrotum. Pathology.—It has long been supposed that elephantiasis Arabum results from some obstruction to the return of lymph from the affected area and indeed the enlargement of the part is usually preceded by repeated attacks of lymphangitis attended with fever. The fact that the disease is endemic in certam countries, and even in individual islands and limited districts, suggests

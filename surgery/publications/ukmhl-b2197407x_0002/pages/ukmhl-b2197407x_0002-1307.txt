The hymen as a tense ela t c membiane proiects downwards between the labia owing to the pressure of the S d^^d^ L vagina, which may be felt rectu.^ --^J- ^^^^^^^^^^ fillino- the nelvik and occasionally extending upwards into the abdomen as t.i a the umbits, bearing the uterus as a small firm tumour ^MW^^^' Treatment for the relief of this condition is best undertaken ^^out m^way between the menstrual periods, as indicated by recurrence of the mohmma. Th operation required, unless carefully performed, is by no means free fiom risk The patient having been placed in the lithotomy posi ion, the parts are first thoroughly cleansed with an antiseptic solution. A small vertical incision one inch in length, is next made in the region of the hymen by cautiously dividing the obstructing tissues until the retained fluid is reached. The use of Paquelin's cautery knife for this purpose is preferable to that of an ordinary scalpel, as tending to obviate risk of septiceemia. In opening the membrane care should be taken to avoid injury to the urethra, an accident to be guarded against by ordinary caution. Once the opening is made, the fluid should be aUowed to escape slowly without the assistance of any pressure whatever from above, in order to avoid the risk of rupturing the Fallopian tubes or any vascular adhesions around them, by promoting too rapid collapse ot the distended sac. When the fluid ceases to flow, the vertical opening is to be enlarged by two lateral incisions converting it into the form of a cross, aud the cavity may then be very gently irrigated by a stream of warm carbolized lotion (;i_40). Finally, a small plug of iodoform gauze is placed m the newly- made orifice, and covered over with a pad of antiseptic wool, which should be changed as often as may be rendered advisable by the amount of discharge. The use of the catheter is usually required for a day or two after the operation. The patient should remain in bed for a fortnight. Partially Perforate Hymen in young newly-married women is a con- •lition which may occasionally call for interference ; incision of the rigid membrane with a probe-pointed bistoury, followed by forcible dilatation under un anesthetic, is the proper treatment in such cases. When severe spasmodic pain of the character usually described as Vaginismus is habitually induced by attempted coition, its origin, failing other causes such as urethral caruncle, small fissures or ulcerations, etc., may occasionally be traced to a hyperissthetio condition of the remains of the hymen. In these cases, excision with curved scissors of a complete ring of the sensitive tissue at the vaginal orifice

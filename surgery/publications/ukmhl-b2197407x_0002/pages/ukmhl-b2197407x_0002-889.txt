■ .SLOUGHING OF THE SAC. 857 f fV.o Sm-creon • by a careful unravelling, not a libtle-embarrassment to the ff^'.'^^^e out ; their fluid con- TLTrm^^^^^ comparatively healthy gut should consist in clodt irby Lem^^ matures (Vol. L, p. 885). The gut must be very IreMly clea^^ with some antiseptic solution before being returned If he v^oun^^^^^^^^^ gut which is softened and inflamed, the case should be treated Tone of perforation from ulceration. In the case of mmute punctures in tne gut 1st ey Cooper recommended that the margins of the wound should be s^zed with a pair of forceps, and a fine silk hgature tied tightly round them Th s plan has-been successfully adopted, and in a case in which I once used it and in which the patient died on the fourth day from gangrene of the gut the silk hgature was found to be completely enveloped in firm plastic exudation. It is probably safer, however, to approximate the serous layer with two 01 more Lembert's sutures, even though the wound be a mere pnncture. Wound of one of the Arteries in the neighbourhood of the sac may occur during the division of the stricture, either in consequence of some anomaly in the distribution of the vessel, or from the Surgeon dividing the parts in a wrong direction. This accident usually happens to the_ epigastric or to the obturator artery ; and Lawrence collected fourteen cases m. which it occurred The result in these has been very various : m some the patients have died ; in others, after much loss of blood, and consequent famtness, the bleeding ceased spontaneously. The proper Treatment would certainly consist in cutting down upon and securing the bleeding vessel. In the event of the Surgeon operating on a case of hernia, without having been able pre- viously to satisfy himself as to its precise character, or if from any cause, m dividino- the stricture, he have reason to dread the proximity of an artery, he may readily divide the constriction with a knife that would not easily cut an artery ; and he will find, that if he blunt the edge of his hernia knife by draw- in<v it over the back of a scalpel, it will still be keen enough to relieve the strangulation, whilst it will push before it any artery that may happen to be in the way. , . 1 Sloughing of the Sac is of rare occurrence, and, when it happens, is com-

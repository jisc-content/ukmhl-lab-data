When first formed, most hernia may De said to be Incomplete, being for a time retained within the orifice of the canal through which they eventually protrude. When they have passed alto- gether beyond the abdominal walls, they are said to be Complete ; and this is the condition m which they are usually presented to the Surgeon. A hernia ■may also be Reducible, Irreducible, or Strangulated. EEDUCIBLE HERNIA. A hernia is commonly at first Reducible; that is to say, it may readily be pushed back into the cavity of the abdomen, protruding again when the patient stands up, holds his breath, or makes any exertion, and having a dis- tinct and forcible impulse on coughing. Though the contents, in these cases, are reducible, the sac is not; it almost immediately contracts adhesions to the areolar tissue, by which it is firmly fixed in its new situation ; though in some cases, as will be seen hereafter, it may be pushed back. The question as to whether a hernia is of recent origin or of old standing sometimes presents itself in medico-legal practice. In determining this the following points deserve attention :—1. A recent hernia resulting from injury is attended with pain—usually severe—from laceration of the structures of the

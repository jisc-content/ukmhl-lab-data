This operation was first performed by Lindemanu ot Hanover. He divided the abdominal wall by a vertical incision under antiseptic precautions, and exposed the surface of the liver. The wound was then held open and a number of fine sutures passed attaching the peritoneum €0 tie skm Iwo strong threads were then passed through the cyst-wall paraM to the edge of the wound, by means of which it was drawn well out of tne abdomen. It was then opened freely between the threads and the parasitic cyst cleaned out as far as possible. Finally the cyst-wall was closely sewn to tne sJiin, a large drainage tube inserted and an antiseptic dressing applied. Ihis operation may conveniently be modified as follows : After exposiuo-the €yst the peritoneum is plugged around with sponges, and the cyst partially emptied with an aspirator needle. It is then drawn well up into the wound and incised, the edges of the opening being held in several pairs of forci- pressure forceps. The cyst-wall and its contents are next removed as thoroughly as possible with the finger or forceps, and finally the edges of the incision in the liver are carefully sutured to those of the skin incision, and a large drainage tube is inserted. Owing to the abundance of the discharge, and Its highly putrescible character, the utmost care must be taken with the antiseptic dressing. Thomas in 1889 was able to collect 68 cases of hydatid of the liver in which this treatment had been adopted. Of these 7, or 10-i'!) per cent., died, and the remainder, nearly !J0 per cent., were cured; septic complications were the most common cause of death. Volkmann advised that if there are no adhesions the operation should 1)6 performed in two stages, the surface of the liver being first exposed, and the wound plugged with carbolic gauze for five or six days till firm adhesions

If the hitch be felt between one inch and one and thiee-quaLrs, the stricture is in the membranous part ; if between one and tir -quarters and three inches, it is in the bulbous portion For the purpos of measuring slight strictures, Otis, of New York, invented an instrument which he calls the " urethrometer " (Fig. 915). It consists of a straight tube, the end of which can be dilated into a sort of fenestrated sphere, and the size to which it is dilated is registered on a small dial on the handle. The instru- ment can be readily introduced into the bladder, if necessary, but there is no advantage in so doing. When in the urethra, behind the strictui;e, the bulb is gradually expanded till it is just held, but not tightly grasped. It is then drawn steadily forward, and when it is stopped the bulb is gradually diminished till it passes the stricture. The exact size of each part is thus registered on the dial. j i. j i. The Treatment of organic stricture of the urethra may be conducted by Fig. 915.—Otis's Urethrometer. a, Open ; b, End closed. the following methods:—!, Gradual Mechanical Dilatation; 2, Continuous Dilatation ; 3, Electrolysis ; 4, Forcible Expansion or Rupture ; 5, Internal Urethrotomy ; 6, External Urethrotomy or Perineal Section ; 7, Excision. Whatever plan of treatment be adopted, the Surgeon must bear in mind that his operations have to be conducted upon a tender canal endowed with exquisite sensibility, in which improper violence may set up a degree of irritation that will readily extend to neighbouring structures, and thus endanger the life of the patient. But, though it is necessary to recollect this, he must not run into the opposite and equally dangerous extreme of adopt- ing inefficient measures for the removal of the obstruction. A bad stricture is one of the most serious diseases to which the human frame is liable, and will almost inevitably, if left to itself, terminate fatally by the induction of renal disease, or of serious local complications. We must therefore not hesitate to adopt sufficiently energetic measures for its removal; and if these be properly conducted, there is scarcely any affection in which the Surgeon can afford his patient greater relief. At the same time, however, that local means are being used, constitutional treatment should not be neglected. Organic stricture is often more or less associated with a spasmodic or congestive condition of the urethra, and requires the same constitutional treatment, modified according to circumstances, that is necessary in these affections —proper regulation of diet, avoidance of all articles of food that generate

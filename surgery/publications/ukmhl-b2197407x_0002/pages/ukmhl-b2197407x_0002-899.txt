This point in diagnosis will be more fully treated of m spealang of congenital hernia. In the meanwhile, it may be stated that the absence of persistent and continuous vomiting and constipation, the feel of the tumour, hard below, elastic above, and the peculiar testicular pam when it is compressed, will enable the Surgeon to recognize its true nature. n . ^ 2 When the hernia has descended i?ito the scrotum, it may be confounded with â€¢ a. Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis. In this disease there is an oval or pyriform tumour, usually translucent, dull on percussion, unchangeable in gize or shape by pressure, and having the cord clear and distinct above it, u'ith an absence of impulse on coughing, or of gurgling in attempts at reduc- tion The resemblance is greater in cases in which the sac of the hydrocele is prolonged upwards into the inguinal canal. The patient will usually have noticed in hydrocele that the swelling first appeared at the bottom of the scrotum, while in hernia it descended from above. In cases of congenital hydrocele in children, in which there is still an opening communicating with the peritoneal cavity, the tumour may be diminished in size by steady pressure, but gradually returns, fluctuates, and is translucent. In these cases its translucency, and the gradual manner in which the sac is emptied and is refilled, very ditferent from the sudden slipping up and protrusion of a hernia, enable the Surgeon to establish the diagnosis. In infants, however, it must be remembered that a hernia is often translucent, as it seldom contains omentum, and the contents of the gut may be chiefly gas. It not unfrequently happens that hernia is complicated ivith hydrocele of the tunica vaginahs. Li these cases the two separate-tumours can usually be distinguished, there being some degree of constriction, or of consolidation, between them. The hydrocele will present its ordinary characters of translucency, irreducibility, and circum- scribed outline, and is placed chiefly below the hernia, which lies towards the upper and anterior part of the scrotum, and may be distinguished by its reduci- bihty and impulse on coughing. It sometimes happens, as in a case which once fell under my observation, that a hydrocele of the cord is associated ivith one of the tunica vaginalis and a hernia ; in such circumstances, the diagnosis requires a little care, but may be effected readily enough by separately deter- 3 K 2

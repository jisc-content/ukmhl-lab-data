If the tumour be smgle, it may usually be cured by opening it bfa mall incision wiping it out with a strong solution of chloride of nc^or mcture of lodme and inserting a drainage-tube under an antiseptic dres in ' for a few days. If it seem to be surrounded by indurated mammary t'ssiL^ It is best to dissect It out and to remove it with the lobule of the mammaTo* which It IS attached. On doing this it will often be found that the cyst is not single, as was at first supposed, but that several smaller sacs are present which have been concealed by the larger one. If the cyst contain inticystic growths, it should be completely removed with the neighbouring part of the mammary gland. If the cysts are multiple they must be treated accordiuff to circumstances. If there are but two or three they may be treated as if sinHe but if very numerous there is nothing to be done but to remove the breast if operative interference is demanded. SIMPLE TUMOUES OF THE BREAST. Lipoma.—Fatty tumours have occasionally been met with in close proxi- mity to the mamma, so as to simulate a tumour of the gland itself. A little careful examination will usually enable the Surgeon to ascertain that the gland is not implicated. Tlie Treatment of these tumours presents nothin<r peculiar. Fibroma.—Pure fibroma of the mamma is very rare. Two cases only have occurred in University College Hospital in the last fifteen years. One was a middle-aged woman, and tlie tumour, which was about the size of a hen's egg, was of stony hardness. It was thought to be a scirrhus, but as there was some doubt, a deep incision was made into it before removiufr the breast. It was found to be exceedingly dense, creaked under the knife, and no capsule was recognized. After removal of the breast, it was found to

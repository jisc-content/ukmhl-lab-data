A series of four or five apertures, forming a circle round the breast, may thus form, and it very commonly happens that these contract into sinuses, which are by no means easi y closed. Treatment.—The occurrence of suppuration should, if possible, be pie- vented by the means adopted in other forms of inflammation of the breast Great care must be taken to prevent movement of the arm. _ When once pus has formed it should be evacuated without delay by an mcision at the border of the breast, and if possible at its lower and outer part. A laro-e drainage-tube should be used and an antiseptic dressing applied. Troublesome sinuses more often follow this than any other form of mammary abscess. It has been proposed to slit these up by free incisions directed towards the nipple; but this is unnecessarily severe practice, and may, I believe, in all cases be avoided. It will often be found that the delay m healino- is due to the existence of a. cavity beneath the mamma which is imperfectly drained by the sinuses. Under these circumstances, the onfices ,)f the sinuses should be enlarged with a knife, and the tracks ddated with the fino-er. They should then be scraped with a sharp spoon to remove the unhealthy granulation tissue, after which they should be cleaned with a piece of sponge soaked in chloride of zinc solution (gr. 40 to 33), held m a pair of sinus-forceps. A drainage-tube should then be inserted into each, and

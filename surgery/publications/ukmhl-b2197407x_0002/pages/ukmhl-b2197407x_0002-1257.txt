1225 CAECINOMA OF THE PBNIS. The most remavkable case of this kind on ^^^''^^ ^.^'^^1^^:^\'^,''Z. uecticnt. It was that of a young man, m whom, ^ft<=i/P'^'f'"" '"j^, „{ "en al phimosis and the removal of warts, a horn grew from the left s de ot rhe glan? penis and attained a si.e of tl.ree an a ha f ^^^l^^^^, three-fourths of an inch in diameter at tlie base it couiu cut without pain, and the patient " was accustomed co amuse the inmates 0 the ward by lighting the end of the horn and allowing it to bmn. it was excised, and did not ]-eturn. „„rior cnrffloe Sebaceous Cysts arc occasionally met with, usually on the ^^^er suitace „f the penis or prepuce.

Sarcoma of the Penis is very rare. It appears to commence m the cavernous tissue. The only available treatment is amputation. Carcinoma of the Penis.-The form of cancer met with in the penis is Squamous Carcinoma. It usually springs from the sulcus behind the glans, and thence invades the neighbouring portion of the organ. It always com- mences in the anterior extremity of the penis, afPecting the body of the organ only by extension from the original starting-point. It appears in two forms, either as a flat tubercle or as a distinctly papillary growth. When it com- mences as a tubercle it appears as a hard pale reddish-white mass situated on the glans or between the prepuce and the glans. This increases in size, and extends deeply into the organ. At last a crack forms and allows a serous discharge to exude, which usually becomes very fetid. Ulceration then rapidly takes place. Sometimes the disease appears to be very distinctly localized ; but after its removal it will usually be found to infiltrate the organ for a con- siderable distance. The papillary form at first presents the appearance of ordinary warts (Fig. 942). It grows rapidly, and a deep-seated indurated base can be felt beneath

The subsequent management of the case is identical with that already described. The treatment of the uterine stump by means of the serre-nceud, known as the exira-peritoneal method, is on the whole the most generally applicable as well as the safest plan for adoption in dealing with fibro-rayomatous tumours. It however, involves a somewhat protracted stage of convalescence m bed, lastino- usually five to six weeks; and farther, the operation is liable occa- sionally to be followed by a ventral hernia at the lower end of the scar Another form of treatment, termed the intra-peritoneal method, although involving more immediate risk to life, avoids the disadvantages above alluded to, and may sometimes be adopted successfully in suitable cases. In this operation, the uterine appendages having first been tied off, the body ot the uterus is constricted by an elastic ligature, and the tumour is cut away. An antero-posterior wedge-shaped piece is now excised from the uterine stump, and any portion of mucous membrane remaining on the inner surface of the two flaps of uterine tissue thus formed is carefully dissected off down to the level of the constricting ligature. The opening of the cervical canal, after being thoroughly cleansed by the use of a strong solution of carbolic acid (1 in 10), is then accurately closed by a few points of suture including mucous membrane alone ; these are to be cut short. The trunk of each uterine artery is next secured by means of a ligature passed from behind forwards through the base of each uterine flap, and thence returned through the corresponding broad ligament to be tied at its original point of entry. The two flaps of uterine tissue, having been thoroughly cleansed, are then united face to face by successive rows of buried sutures until the stump is completely closed in, a final series of stitches being employed to accurately unite the divided edges of its peritoneal investment. The elastic ligature is now removed, aud if no oozing be seen, the stump is dropped in, and the abdomen closed in the usual way. The submucous variety of fibro-rayoma, when occurring as a single growth of a more or less sessile character projecting into and dilating the uterine cavity, may occasionally necessitate surgical interference in consequence of alarming and persistent haemorrhage which has proved totally unamenable to ordinary gynsecological treatment.

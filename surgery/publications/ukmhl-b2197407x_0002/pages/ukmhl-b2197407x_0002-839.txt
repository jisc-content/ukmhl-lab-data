This necessarily adds to the length and severity of the operation ; but at the present day the niortahty following the complete operation is very low. The cases m which this rule should be departed from are few, and include those in which, after the removal of the breast itself, the patient's condition forbids further prolongation of the operation, and those cases of extensive disease, in which the breast is excised mainly to rid the patient of a constant source of suffering and annoyance. The failure to detect enlarged glands by examination is no proof of their absence, and for this reason alone it is useless to reserve opening the axilla for those cases in which the glands can be felt. Excision of the Breast.—The question of excision of the breast should always be raised with more than ordinary regard to the ieelings of the patient. A woman looks upon her breast as alike the emblem and the ornament of her womanhood. She shrinks from the idea of its being affected by disease. She suffers acutely in mind when it is invaded by tumour of any kind : the horrid dread of that disease being cancer ever haunts her thoughts, not so much from the fear of the possibly impending operation, as from the distress of mind, in

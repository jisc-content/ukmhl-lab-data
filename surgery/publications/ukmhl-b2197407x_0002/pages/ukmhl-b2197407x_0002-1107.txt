RECTO-VESICAL LITHOTOMY. io7S .nened But, it may be said, what is easier, when the finger is in the bladder, hCto' push ; probJ-pointed bistoury along it, and cut ^o^-ar^^^^^^^^^^ ;ids through these structures into the ischiorectal fossa, if the stone be laige thus ge^^ of space ? Nothing could be easier or more ^imp^ ; but ;tt would be the consequence ? We at ouce reduce the med.an to the _c^^^^^ litions of the lateral operation. A free incision m the neck of the bladd^^^ and estate increases the tendency to hemorrhage, opens up ^asm a^^^^ ^oses the patient, in fact, to all the dangers of an Si destroying at once and altogether the principle of the median operation ^vCdilaTation and not incision ; and, if we do not gain space by incision 3ut attempt to extract a moderately large stone by dilatation of the parts we hall certainly not succeed, but our dilatation will end in a laceration, not only >fThe substance of the prostate, which is safe, but of the neck and perhaps of ,he base of the bladder, which will be fatal. , , , p n ^-.n- fhk Mortality.-lt is not easy to determine the death-rate following this operation, as the results are generally included with other ^ethods of per,^ D^al hthotomy. Barling has collected 48 operations performed between 188b and 1892 ; of these 6 died, giving a mortality of 12"5 per cent. Other Methods op Performing Lithotomy.—Having tuUy desciioea the suprapubic, lateral, and median operations of lithotomy, it remains only to mention very briefly certain other methods which have been adopted, but which at the present day have been almost, if not entirely, discarded. Bilateral Lithotomy.—This operation, which was introduced by Dupuytren, consisted in making a curved transverse incision with its concavity backwards half an inch in front of the anus. The dissection was carried down to the central point of the perinseum and the membranous urethra opened on a grooved median staff. Along this a lithotome cache was passed, which divided both lateral lobes of the prostate in a direction downwards and outwards. The stone was then extracted in the usual way. Medio-Bilateral Lithotomy was recommended by Civiale for the ox- , traction of stones too large for the ordinary median operation. It consisted of a combination of the median and bilateral. The membranous part of the J urethra was opened on a rectangular staff as in the median operation. The Mithotome was then introduced and the prostate and the soft structures ( between it and the surface incised. If the stone Avas not very large, the deep ! incision was confined to one side only, and used with a probe-pointed bistoury. Recto-vesical Lithotomy was suggested by Sanson in 1847 as a means of removing large stones and avoiding the dangers of haemorrhage. It was thus performed. A staff grooved on its convexity was passed into the bladder, the finger was then passed into the rectum, and the part of the staff lying in the membranous portion of the urethra felt for; a knife, with its edge directed^ forwards, was then passed along the finger into the groove of the staff and withdrawn, dividing the internal and external sphincters and the skin at the margin of the anus; it was then reintroduced with its edge directed downwards, and run along the groove of the staff, dividing the prostate and notching the neck of the bladder, and the stone was then extracted in the usual way. Having now described the various operations of lithotomy it will be con- venient to reserve the consideration of the relative advantages of the principal methods until after the operation of Lithotrity has been described in the following Chapter.

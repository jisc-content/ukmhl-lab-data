Thompson's lithotrite (Fig. 875) somewhat resembles Cmales m its action, but is more handy. The handle of the female blade is round, which gives the operator a better grasp of the instrument, and the sliding movement is converted into a screw action by drawing up the button on the handle with I'ig. 8S0.â€”Clover's Lithotrity lujection-Apparatus. 1.

326 DISEASES OF JOINTS. CHAPTER XLVIII. DISEASES OF JOINTS.—EXCISION OF JOINTS. Joints may become the seat of Inflammatory Affections of an acute or chronic character; of Tuberculous Disease; or of various other morbid conditions, such as more or less permanent rigidity, or Ankylosis, the forma- tion of Foreign Bodies within their cavities, and Neuralgia. In studying these various articular affections, it must be borne in mind that a joint is composed of a number of different structures : of synovial membrane, cartilage, bone, ligament, and capsule, or investing fibrous expansion. Disease may primarily begin in any one of these structures, though eventually the morbid process usually spreads to other tissues entering into the formation of the joint. The merit of having been the first to point out the true mode of studying these afi'ections in reference to the different structures in which they have originated, is certainly due to Benjamin Brodie. SYNOVITIS. Inflammation of the Synovial Membrane may occur under two forms: simple or serous, and purulent or suppurative. In the former the inflamma- tion aifects the synovial membrane only, and has little tendency to extend to the other structures of the joint; in the latter the capsule, and ligaments, the cartilages and even the bones ultimately become implicated unless the in- flammation is arrested by treatment, and consequently this form soon merges into the affection known as acute arthritis, with which it will be described Clinically the term Synovitis used by itself is commonly apphed only to the '''seL^uTor Simple Synovitis, is perhaps, the most common of all articular ntfpptions It may be acute, subacute or chronic.

Billroth states that he has rroccasTon to do this more than once, and that no evil consequences fol- lowed arely even cedema of the arm. The safety of the patient depends very much however, on the successful prevention of decomposition in the wound Should the iniured vessel be bathed in decomposing discharges, the patient would be exposed to the imminent danger of septic thrombosis and pyemia which formerly made Surgeons hesitate to apply a ligature to a vein, i^ntiy of air into the vein is a danger which must be borne in mind while removing glands in close proximity to it. It is best avoided by careful dissection, but should the vein be unavoidably in danger, an assistant should place his hnger on it if possible, on the cardiac side of the exposed part. Wound ot the artery is much less common. It is most likely to occur from shaving the sub- scapular branch away so closely as to leave a circular aperture in the side ot the main trunk. It can only be avoided by not using sharp instruments m this region. Should it happen, the main trunk must be tied on each side ot the wound. . ;i • Instead of the incisions described above, a very convenient metnoci is represented in Fig. 787. The curved incisions are disposed transversely instead of obHquely, and the axilla is opened by drawing the skin over it well forward, and making an incision fi-om near the outer end of the wound along the anterior border of the axilla. This incision Hes over the middle of the space when the traction on the skin is removed, and by turning the small flaps backwards and forwards a very free exposure of the axilla is obtained (Fig. 788). In all cases the parts removed must be carefully examined in order to make certain that the incisions are very wide of the disease, and that the whole breast has been removed. For this purpose the nitric acid test introduced by Stiles, of Edinburgh, will be found useful. This depends upon the fact that the acid renders any fi-agments of new growth or breast tissue of an opaque white colour, and thus easily discernible. " The breast immediately after its removal is placed (after washing off all the blood), in from one to two pints of a five per cent, nitric acid solution for about ten minutes; and then washed in running water for three or four minutes. By this means the characteristic reaction is produced upon the surface, so that outlying portions

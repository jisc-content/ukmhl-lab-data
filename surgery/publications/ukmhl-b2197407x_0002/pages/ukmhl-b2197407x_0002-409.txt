EXCISION OF JOINTS: OPERATION. 317 purpose the sinuses should be scraped with a sharp spoon and afterwards scrubbed with a small piece of sponge held in a pair of forceps and soaked in a solution of chloride of zinc (gr. xl. to 3]*.), perchloride of mercury (1 in 500), or tincture of iodine (5ij. to Oij.). The whole wound should also be washed with some powerful antiseptic solution, and afterwards treated by some anti- septic method. Thorough drainage and antiseptic treatment have of late yeai-s greatly diminished the death-rate after excisions in general, and especially of the knee. After the dressing is applied, the limb must be placed on a pillow or a Avell-padded splint according to the joint operated on. As healing pro- gresses, great attention must be paid to position, and passive movement must be commenced after the first week when a movable joint is desired. 10. The constitutional after-treatment should be nourishing or stimulating. As there may be a great drain on the system should profuse suppuration set in, with prolonged confinement to bed, the strength must be kept up under it by good diet. These operations are always serious ; in many cases fully as much so as the amputation of a corresponding part, or even more so, owing to the large wound that is often inflicted in the more extensive division of the bones; to the necessity of making the incisions in the midst of diseased structures ; and to the more prolonged character of the after-treatment. 11. Should caries or necrosis return after the operation, secotidary resection may be required. This I have done successfully at the hip, shoulder, and elbow joints. In the elbow, in one case I performed a third resection with perfect success ; the two previous operations, which had been performed by other Surgeons, having failed.

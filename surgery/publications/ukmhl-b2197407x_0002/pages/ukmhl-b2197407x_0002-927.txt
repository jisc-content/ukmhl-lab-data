Varieties and Causes of Acute Intestinal Obstruction.—Acute intestinal obstruction may arise from—1, internal strangulation of the bowel; 2 volvulus or twist ; 3, impaction of concretions or foreign bodies in the small intestine ; 4, stricture of the small intestine becoming suddenly occluded, and 6, acute intussusception. 1. Internal Strangulation.—This affects almost invariably the small in- testine. It resembles in its main features ordinary strangulated hernia, diflfering solely in the fact that the cause of constriction is situated within the abdomi- nal cavity, and not at an aperture in its wall. As a rule the strangulation is Fig. 813.—Strangulation of intestine by a band attached to a diverticitluiu from tlie ileum. less severe in internal obstructions than in external hernias, and gangrene of the gut is comparatively rare. In the majority of cases the constriction arises from a portion of gat shpping under or becoming entangled in a band passing from one part of the abdominal cavity to another. These bands are often many inches in length, usually rounded in form and from a tenth to a third of an inch in diameter. They are composed of fibrous tissue, and are often of considerable strength. From the fact that they are most commonly single, (ray described these under the name of " solitary bands." They are supposed to be formed, in many cases at least, by adhesions between two portions of the abdominal contents, resulting from localised peritonitis. Thus inflammation of a mesenteric gland may cause the adhesion of a neighbouring part of the mesentery or of a coil of the intestine, or a typhoid or tuberculous ulcer may cause the adhesion of two portions of the ileum. The fibrous adhesion thus formed is supposed to be gradually stretched and rounded by the

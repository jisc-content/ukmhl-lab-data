517 TUMOURS OF MUSCLE: TREATMENT. The ^V^rt/wmif of these various muscular tumours must be considered on ordinary surgical principles. When of an Innocent character, as cystic or hydatid, fibrous, najvoid, or cartilaginous, they may be dissected out from the muscular tissue amongst which they lie, and no fear of recurrence need be entertained. When they are malignant, amputation of the limb, if the tumour be favour- ably situated for such an operation, is generally the only resource : partial operations are usually worse than useless, as they are followed by a speedy recurrence. Teevan made the ingenious suggestion of applying to malignant tumours of muscle the same rule of practice that guides us in operations on bones similarly affected ; viz., to remove the whole of the organ that is the seat of disease, excising the entire muscle from its origin to its insertion, and thus eliminating from the system the whole of the disease, which will be con- fined within its sheath—a structure that for a long time resists the outward pressure of a new growth. The suggestion is founded on correct pathological principles: the only objection to it is the difficulty of applying it in actual practice—there being few muscles so situated that they can with safety be completely extirpated.

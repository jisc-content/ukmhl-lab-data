56o DEFORMITIES OF TIfE LEC AND FOOT. t^tlipes valgus; the former being frequently associated with more or loss Taliim egmms may result from the unopposed action of the calf mu8cl.« when the antcnor muscles of the leg are paralysed, or from subs« contraction of the former when themselves paralysed. It may also come o, from some disease, such as an abscess in the calf by which the Jashn cnemms IS contracted and crippled. Talipes valgus or calcamo-valgusTZ ^^ ith in its most marked form wlien the muscles of the calf, the tibialis post.^u and the flexors ot the toes are paralysed. The foot is everted, the arch i obliterated, so that the sole becomes flattened. The anterior part of the foot is displaced outwards at the calcaneo-cuboid and astragalo-scaphoid articulation, and the scaphoid is partially dislocated outwards, so that the head of the astragalus projects at the inner side of the foot. The projection of the heel backwards is obliterated, and the outer side of the foot cm'ved round so that the little toe is approximated to the point of the heel. In extreme cases of calcaneo-valgus, the arch of the foot is sometimes in- creased, the heel being pointed down, and the foot sharply bent at the transverse medio-tarsal articulation, so as to bring the toes to the ground. I have met with a case of Talipes calcamus in a girl twelve years of age, in whom it was the result of contraction of the extension consequent upon loss of power in the flexors. A minor degree of this affection consists in a peculiar projection upwards of one or two of the toes, associated with some tension of the extensor tendons ; by di^dding these, and keeping the foot on a flat splint, the deformity may commonly be corrected. In some cases, however, the toe is so prominent, and the contiguous ones are squeezed under

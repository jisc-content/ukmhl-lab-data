APPLICATION OF THE COMPRESSOR. 137 works on this subject, to which I must reier for a fuller account than I can here o-ivc. u • • 11 In ^applying the compressor, especial care must be taken that it is well padded in every pai-t, so as not to gall the skin. In some of the early cases in which I saw compression employed in London by means of the horse-shoe Fig. 401.—Compressor for the Middle of the Thigh. Fig. 462.—Compressor for the Groin. tourniquet, much Inconvenience resulted from want of attention to this point. The tendency to irritation of the skin is much lessened by powdering the limb, and the removal of the hairs by shaving. In order to keep up continuous pressure, and at the same time to prevent injury to the skin, it is of very great consequence that two instruments should be used at the same time, so that when one is screwed down the other may be loose ; these instruments need not be placed close together. If the aneurism be in the ham, it will be sufficient for one (Fig. 462) to be applied to the groin, whilst the other (Fig. 461) is put upon the middle of the thigh (Fig. 463). In using the instru- ment, the great point is to control the circulation with the minimum of pressure. In order to do this, the first instrument should be screwed down so that all pulsation ceases in the tumour, but still not so tightly as completely to arrest all the flow of blood through it. As the pressure exercised by this becomes painful, the second compressor must be screwed tight, and then the first may be slackened. In this way an alternation of pressure can be kept Fig. 4(33.—Two Compre.ssors applied for Femoro- popliteal Aiieiirism.

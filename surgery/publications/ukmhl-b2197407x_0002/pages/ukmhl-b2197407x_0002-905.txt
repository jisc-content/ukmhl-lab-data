This certainly greatly simplifies the operation, and the part o he sac left behind seems to give no trouble in the ^^ter-treatment. It h^^^^^^^ lurther advantage that the incision need not be prolonged into the scrotum and thus firm pressure can be brought to bear upon its whole ength, and tlie risk of extravasation of blood into the loose tissues of the scrotum is avoided. Barker, after ligaturing the neck of the sac with fine silk and dmdmg it below passes the two ends of the ligature through the borders of the ring as high iip as possible, and thus fixes the stump of the sac, and at the same time the ligature serves as the highest stitch in closing the ring. Macewen at er dis- secting out the sac and emptying it, inserts the index finger outside the sac -till it reaches the internal ring and separates the peritoneum from tne •abdominal wall for about half an inch. He then inserts a long catgut suture into the distal extremity of the sac ; the free end of this is then passed m a proximal direction several times through the sac, so that when pulled upon the sac is folded upon itself like a curtain ; it is then passed by means of a needle throuo-h the inguinal canal and made to penetrate the abdominal muscles about°an inch above the level of the internal ring. By pulling on this thread the sac is folded upon itself and dragged into the inguinal canal, the part that was-the iTindus being highest up. It is finally fixed in this position by passing the end of the thread several times through the superficial layers of the muscles. Th€ pad thus formed" helps to obhterate the inguinal canal. The ring is afterwards closed with sutures. Ball, of Dublin, has recommended twisting the stump of the sac four or five times with torsion-forceps as a means of . more certainly occluding it. / In closing the ring, silk, catgut, and wire have been used. Perhaps silk is the best, as it is not too early absorbed, and can be rendered aseptic with great ease aiid certainty. The method which has been most generally adopted consists in simply passing the sutures through each side of the ring without paying any special attention to the structures pierced by the needle, care being merely taken to avoid puncturing the cord, or strangulating it by too tight closure of the ring. Macewen, however, pointed out that this method of suturing failed in every way to restore the natural vaired condition of the inguinal canal, and with

292 INFLAMMATION OF BONE AND ITS EFFECTS. removed from within the periosteum ; {ind that, if the periosteum be dissected ott" in slips, and twisted here and there between the muscles of the limb, new bone of various shapes may be formed on and by this partially detached mem- brane. Oilier has further shown that, although in man, after operations and disease, new bone may be formed by the contiguous osseous tissue, and even by the neighbouring soft parts, yet the periosteum is essentially the organ of the regeneration of bone ; thus confirming, by new and ingenious experiments, and by additional observations, the views that have just been expressed. The whole of a necrosed bone may, after separation, be reproduced by the perios- teum. This is admirably illustrated by the annexed drawing, taken from the photograph of a preparation in the museum of the late J. Wood of New York. The whole of the inferior maxilla had separated as the result of phosphorus disease; the patient, a girl, lived for three years, the lower jaw having been reproduced as a perfect ring of bone, as ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ represented in Fig. 516. ^ ^ ^^^^^^^^^ In acute necrosis, repair commences as -^^^^ soon as the intensity of the inflamma- Pig. J- tion has been reduced by the escape of pus through the incisions. In a few days the swollen and thickened periosteum will be found to be lined with scales of new bone, the first step towards the reproduction of the shaft The new bone deposited on those parts of the surface of the shaft from which a scale of the old osseous tissue has been separated, or envelopmg The sequestrum when the whole thickness of tlie shaft becomes necrosed is t fir t rough, porous, canceUated, and very vascular ; after a time it gradua y fe omes ha'rder and more compact. The case ^'^l^^^,^'^^^^ exceeds in circumference the old bone, as this is included withm it, gradua y contracts both in texture and in size, becoming firmer and smaller after the emova of the sequestrum ; and, the cloaca closing as soon as all dead bone haTbeen extruded, it eventually acquires the proper size and shape of the bon ; the medu lary canLl even becoming more or less perfectly restored. In li^ wav restoSon of the whole of the shaft of many of the long bones, such as way, ^es^°^f;°'^^ , leg, will take place, provided always the ^Syses WeTen leT—ed hy^ disease.

TREATMENT OF URINARY FISTULA. 1209 adopted, a moderate-sized elastic catheter should be used If ^^^^^^ ^^'^ the urine will flow between it and the sides of the ^hra,..^^^^^^^^^ through the fistula ; if too large, it stretches the urethral orifice of the fistula "Tltricture be very tough and irritable, the better plan is 1.^^^^^^ urethrotomy at once.

The special treatment for urinary fistula must vary according to the size of the track, but more particularly with regard to the part of the urethra with which it communicates—whether it be a Perineal, a Scrotal, or a Penile fistula. But in all cases, and wherever it be situated, there is one most important point to be attended to, viz. never to let the fistula be disturbed or irritated by the passage of urine over or through it, or it will never heal. Hence the urine must always be drawn' off with the catheter, which the patient should be taught to pass for himself. If the fistula be Perinmal, and of small size, a probe coated with melted nitrate of silver, or a wire made red-hot in the ordinary way, or by the galvanic current, and passed down it occasionally, may cause its contraction. If the fistula be single and large, its edges should be freely rubbed with nitrate of silver, or deeply pared and brought together by sutures, after which the urine should be drawn off, whenever required, by a catheter. If the fistute be large and numerous, it will be better to pass a grooved director down the principal ones, and slit them up so as to throw the several sinuses into one. When the fistula is Scrotal, it often requires to be laid open, and to be made to granulate from the bottom, when it may be found to communicate with a large sloughy and ill-conditioned cavity in this situation. When Penile, the fistula is usually much more troublesome to heal; its edges are thin, and the track is short and shallow. Urethroplasty may in such cases be practised with advantage. Operations of this kind require for their success very careful management and minute attention to detail ; they very commonly fail in consequence of a small quantity of urine or of mucus escaping through the wound, and thus interfering with union of its lips. In order to prevent this accident, which is fatal to the success of the operation, the urine must be drawn off with a catheter every third or fourth hour. Should this, however, not be practicable, a full-sized gum-catheter should be tied into the bladder, and the urine drained away through an india- rubber tube attached to it.

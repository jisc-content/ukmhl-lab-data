In answering this, it is necessary to b agreed uC the meaning of the term " impermeable." If by it be meant impSahl i! the passage of a catheter, there can be no doubt that such stLtares ma^ Fig. 910.—Stricture from Con- solidatioa of Corpus Spon- giosum. Pig. 911.—Bridle-Stricture.

Strictures of this description, however, may usually be ultimately made permeable to instruments by proper and careful treatment. If by " impermeable " is meant generally impervious to the passage of urine, there can be no doubt that such a condition does not exist. It would clearly be incompatible with life, unless a fistulous opening existed behind the stricture, thi-ough which the urine might pass out ; and even with such an aperture existing, I have never seen a case in which no urine whatever escaped by the meatus, unless, in consequence of injury or disease, a portion of the whole calibre of the urethra had sloughed away. 3. The Urethra behind the Stricture is dilated, often so as to form a considerable pouch, in which in rare cases phosphatic concretions may form. The mucous membrane is more opaque than natural, and its loss of elasticity is indicated by its being thrown into longitudinal folds ; it is usually of an

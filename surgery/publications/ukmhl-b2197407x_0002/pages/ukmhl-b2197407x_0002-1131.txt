In these cases, the relapse may take place very shortly after the first operation, and will be preceded by the usual symptoms of the descent of a stone from the kidney. Relapse from the retention of a fragment which serves as the nucleus ot another stone, will undoubtedly occasionally occur, although its occurrence is fairly attributable to want of due care on the part of the Surgeon, it is apt to happen more frequently after lithotrity than after hthotomy, and it is pro- l.ably to this cause chiefly that we must refer the greater hability to relapse after the crushing than the cutting operation. But it may happen alter 'ithotomy that a^fragment is left behind when the stone has been broken, (luring extraction, and the bladder not thoroughly washed out. But even m rhis case, the bit of stone will usually be carried out of the wound by the tiow (if urine through it. Recurrence from the formation of a phosphatic calculus in the bladder, as the result of chronic cystitis with decomposition of the urine, may occur occa- sionally after lithotomy, but is much more common after lithotrity. In these cases a lithotrite must be passed, and the soft mass crushed up and washed out with a catheter and evacuator. The patient must be taught to wash his own bladder out regularly every day with- a dilute acid solution, to which some quinine may be added. I once had under my care a patient eighty years of age, on whom I performed lithotrity for a uric acid calculus. During the next five years I removed large phosphatic concretions on more than a dozen occasions. At last the tendency to recurrence ceased, and for three years before his death no new formation took place. On some occasions the mass measured over an inch and a half in diameter, yet under anesthetics it was broken up and washed out with Bigelow's apparatus without the slightest irritation, the patient usually returning to the country on the second day after the operation. Phosphatic deposit may take place also in the track of a partially healed lithotomy wound, forming a crust on its surface. I have known such a deposit to form in the perinseum, when the wound had degenerated into a sinus. According to C. Williams, the relapses in the Norwich Hospital were 27 in 1015 operations, or 1 in 36, or in 935 lithotomies 1 in 33. Lithotomy was performed a second time on 24 patients; a third time on 3; and a fourth time on 1. Twenty-three were cured, 5 died. All the patients were males. The registers of the Louisville Hospital give 1 relapse in IIG cases of lithotomy ; and according to Civiale the return of calculus after lithotomy was in Bavaria 1 in 32, in Bohemia 1 in 46, in Dalmatia 1 in 43, and in France 1 in 74. After lithotrity, relapse is more common ; although it is probably less

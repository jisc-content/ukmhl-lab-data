DISEASES OF MUSCLES. tumour had attained the size of an ostrich's egg, it was removed, the patient making a good recovery ; but tlie disease again returned, and eventually proved fatal. The fourth case was that of a man aged about 40, in the sole of whose foot a cystic tumour, about as large as a goose's egg, developed irom the flexor brevis digitorum. This was carefully dissected out ; but in a few months the patient returned, with a solid, elastic, rapidly growiug tumour, evidently a sarcoma, developed in the cicatrix (Fig. 019). The foot was amputated, and on section the mass proved to be a soft snrcoma, and to have developed from the muscular structure just named (Fig. (;20). In three cases the tumours were hydatid. In one patient, a young woman, the disease was seated in the deltoid ; in another, a medical man, about 50 Fig. O19.-Sarcomatous Tumoiu- in Sole. Fig. O20.-Section of Foot, showing situation of Tuin.iur. ■years of age, in the outer edge of the latissimus dorsi; and the third in a gentle- man about 60 years old, in the biceps. In each of these cases, the tumour was successfully excised. . . In the eighth case the tumour was a chondroma in the tibiahs anticus. i have seen two other cases of chondroma in muscles : one situated in the vastus externus of the thigh : the other in connexion with the pectoral muscle. The ninth case was a sarcoma of the rectus femoris in a man aged 21, which 1 excised ; the tenth, a mahgnant growth in the anterior abdominal wall in an elderly gentleman ; the eleventh, a soft sarcoma of the muscles of the calt in a middle-aged lady, for which amputation was practised ; and the twelfth, a snrcoma of the forearm in a lad. » Tumours developing primarily in the intermuscular areolar planes are or common occurrence ; but these are very different from, and must not be con- founded with, true tumours of muscle.

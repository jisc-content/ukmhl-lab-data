TUBERCULOUS DISEASE OF PHALANGES. '4^.9 cuneiform, leaving merely the line of bones supporting the great toe, but a very good foot resulted, by which the patient retained in a great measure bis elasticity of tread. For tuberculous disease of the Phalanges amputation is usually reqmred. In the case of the great toe, no more of it should be removed than is absolutely necessary, as it enters largely into the formation of the arch of the foot. It is especially of importance that the ball of the great toe, if possible, be pre- served ; and occasionally this may be effected by excision of the metatarso- phalangeal articulation rather than by the amputation of the member. With regard to the removal of the toe and its metatarsal bone, I must refer to Yol. I., p. 114. Whenever it is practicable, the proximal end of the bone should be saved, in order that the insertion of the tendon of the peroneus longus may be preserved.

282 INFLAMMATION OF BONE AND ITS EFFECTS. be put at perfect rest. Thus if the osteitis be secondary to disease of a joint, this must be carefully fixed on a splint. Should there be an open wound strict attention must be paid to drainage, and to the prevention of decomposi- tion in the discharges. 2. Syphilitic Caries has already been described (see Syphilis, Vol. I, p. 1159). It affects most commonly the surface of bones and is then the result of a softening subperiosteal gumma. The disease does not penetrate deeply, but leaves the surface rough and porous, and is accompanied by a good deal of inflammation of the soft parts around the affected bone. It occurs most frequently in adults and is very chronic. Like tuberculous caries it is occasionally complicated by necrosis of smaller or larger fragments of the affected bone. Syphilitic caries is usually readily cured by the ordinary treatment of syphilis, iodide of potassium being especially useful, and by the application of iodoform or iodide of starch ointment. 3. Tuberculous Caries.â€”The evidence has already been considered which shows that by far the most common cause of the destructive inflammation of bone, which is known as caries, is the deposit of tubercle in it. The changes which tubercle produces in a bong have already been described under the separate headings of tuberculous periostitis, tuberculous osteomyehtis, and tuberculous disease of cancellous tissue. It now remains to indicate the symptoms and treatment of these different varieties. It is a point of great practical importance that tuberculous disease of bones and joints frequently follows an injury. The association can hardly be acci- dental, and it seems far more likely that the simple traumatic inflammation predisposes the part to the growth of the tubercle bacillus, which reaches it through the blood-stream, often no doubt from some internal caseous centre. In tuberculous feriosiitis attacking a superficial bone there will be a localized swelling over it, with, in most cases, some pain and tenderness. The super- ficial structures are at first normal, but later the skin becomes oedematous and discoloured, as the chronic abscess invades the soft parts and comes to the surface. If an incision be made it will be found that the periosteum is separated fi'om the bone by curdy pus and granulation tissue, ihe surface ot the bone is usually soft and roughened as the result of a superficial rarefactive ""'t^^merculous osteomyeliMs, such as so frequently affects the metacarpal bones and phalanges, gradual swelling of the bone is ^^^^^ symptom.

9 PRIMARY CARCINOMA OF THE SKIN. after lupus is healed is thiu, and readily breaks down, giving way on exposure to cold, or on the occurrence of constitutional derangement. The patient should, therefore, for some length of time after recovery, be careful not to expose himself to any such influences. The scars often lead to great deformity, drawing down the eyelids, distorting the mouth, and sometimes closing the nostrils. Various plastic operations may be required to remedy these defects. Scrofuloderma.—This name is given to various forms of tuberculous ulcera- tion attacking the skin which differ in their course and clinical features from those of ordinary lupus. The commonest form arises as a small, flat, indurated growth, commencing immediately beneath the cutis vera. The patch slowly extends till it reaches the size of a sixpence or shilling, or even larger. The skin covering it is dusky purple in colour. / Finally, the mass softens, the skin gives W way at one spot, and a thin curdy pus is #/; discharged. The cavity left is covered ^ superficially by a thin layer of undermined - skin, of a dark bluish colour, which is too |L feeble to undertake any process of repair, but ^ ' '\^m yet obtains just enough blood-supply to '^^W prevent its death. Consequently no healing &^ jR^fflF will take place till it is destroyed. After this ^--^-^■^^M has been done the floor of the ulcer will '^^-'>>^^W be seen to be yellow and unhealthy, and the ^^Q^' JL sore may slowly spread instead of healing. ^"'^^^^^■'^mmitam^^^^&=~^i^:> A precisely similar process of ulceration Fig. 415—Tuberculous uicei'of Leg. may have its starting point in a caseous lymphatic gland, which becomes adherent to, and finally bursts through, the ov^erlying skin. Sores of this kind are most common on the face and neck, but they may occur in other parts of the body (Fig. 415). In children these tuberculous foci in the skin are very common ; they are often multiple and not unfrequently associated with tuberculous disease of the bones of the fingers. The Treatmmit consists in freely cutting away the undermined skin and removing the tuberculous tissue with a sharp spoon. The constitutional treatment is the same as for lupus. Carcinoita of the Skin may be either primary or secondary. Primary Carcinoma is met with in two forms: 1. Squamous Carcinoma, and 2. Rodent Ulcer. Squamous Carcinoma or Epithelioma.—The structure and history of this have already been given. It is usually seated about the lips face and scrotum, and at the orifices of the mucous canals. It may in rare cases arise from mahgnant transformation of an atheromatous cyst (Yol. I p 1008) Squamous carcinoma may originate also in an old scar or ulcer In this wav It may occur upon almost any part of the body ; I have seen it on the back the breast, the fingers, the hand, the thigh, and the sole of the foot It then forms a foul ulcer, the floor of which is grey or sloughy, and often covered with large warty granulations and protuberant masses. The base is indurated

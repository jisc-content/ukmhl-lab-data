SUKGICAL OPEBATIONS ON THE CHEST. Tapping the Pleural CAViTY.-The operation of Tapping the Plei^ral Cavity is required in cases of hydrothorax, empyema, and hsemothorax. The point of selection is a spot in the fifth intercostal space on the ateral median Le. This point is crossed by a line drawn horizontally round the body from the nipple to the spine. ^ ^ ■ t As it is of great importance in cases of hydrothorax to exclude the air from the pleural sac, the operation is now almost invariably performed by the aspirator The ordinary bottle-aspirator (Fig. 773) will usually be found the most convenient instrument. The air having been exhausted from the bottle by means of the air-pump, and the stop-cock closed, the chest is tapped m the way presently to be described with the aspirator-trochar ; and the cock m its side being turned on, the fluid rushes into the bottle to fill up the vacuum. The origtnal aspirator, as invented by Dieulafoy (Fig. 94, Vol. I.), may be used, and can easily be converted into a siphon. Thompson's " Siphon-trocJmr " will usually answer the purpose well enough. If it be used the fluid is allowed to run off by the elastic tube, the end of which is immersed in a vessel containing a 1 in 20 solution of carbolic acid (Fig. 774). In the absence of all special instruments the chest may be safely tapped with a common trochar by the simple method suggested by Eeybard. A piece of thick linen or cotton rag free from holes is made into a funnel, the narrow end of which is tied lightly round the cannula immediately below its expanded end. The funnel is then thoroughly soaked in carbolic oil (1 in 10). When the trochar is withdrawn the funnel of oiled rag hangs down from the end of the cannula, and serves to direct the fluid into a vessel held to receive it, and at the same time it forms an efficient valve which prevents the entrance of air during inspiration.

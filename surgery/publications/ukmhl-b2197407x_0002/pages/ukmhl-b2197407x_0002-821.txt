CYSTO-ADENOMA OF THE BREAST. 789 a number of small cysts, varying in size from a pin's head to an inch and a half in diameter, and usually containing clear fluid. The larger cysts contain lobulated, branching, intracystic growths, most commonly sprouting from one side only, and forming pedunculated projections into the cavities. These intracystic growths are not always present. This form of tumour is usually met with in women of from thirty to thirfcy-five years of age, and is often attributed to injury. It occurs most frequently in women who have borne children, and is possibly a remote consequence of some inflammatory process occurring during lactation. On examining a breast affected in this way, it will be found that the tumour is hard, heavy, and sohd to the feel; on careful examination, however, its surface may be felt to be finely nodulated ; Pig. 782.â€”Cysto-Adenoma of mamma, showing large cysts with intracystic growths. and, occasionally, a larger cyst than usual, recognised by its elastic feel and globular shape, may be found projecting. The disease is slow in its growth, and does not implicate the adjacent cutaneous or areolar structures ; hence, the tumour is movable on the pectoral muscles, and the skin is unattached to it. The axillary glands, also, are not enlarged. The nipple will usually be found to be normal in its shape, and not depressed. If one of the larger cysts be laid open, or if the pressure of the intracystic growth causes inflammation and ulceration of its capsule, this may at last be perforated, and a fungous mass will sprout through it, presenting many of the ordinary symptoms of a malignant growth; being irregular, dark-coloured, bleeding readily, and increasing rapidly in size. When such changes as these have taken place, the tumour assumes a formidable character, and will rapidly prove fatal l)y exhaustion. A cysto-adenoma may attain an immense size and

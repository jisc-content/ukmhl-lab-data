STRUCTURAL CJIANGES IN BONE. 3i8 thrilling kind, with or withont a bruit, is distinctly perceptible especially in an advanced stage of the disease, when the vascularity of the tumour is greatly increased. Cysts are not uncommon in the softer forms of sarcoma. Diagnosis.â€”Central sarcoma of bone in its early stages so closely resembles chronic osleilis and periostitis that it is frequently impossible to come to a correct conclusion as to the nature of the case witliout cutting down on the bone and applying a trephine or gouge. In the later stages the diagnosis becomes more easy; the great enlargement of the bone, the occurrence of "egg- shell crackling " on pressure, and. more especially pulsation when it is present, making the nature of the case clear. From r//slic tumours of bone the diagnosis is often impossible, as the great majority of "cysts of bone " (except in the jaws) are really soft sarcomata with cysts developed in the tumour. It is only by cutting into the affected part that the nature of the disease can be ascertained. From disease of the neighbouring joint, the diagnosis is made by observing that the joint does not form the centre of the swelling, and that movement, although limited, is not painful, and is unaccompanied by grating or crackling in the articulation. Should the tumour have penetrated the joint, which is very rare, the difficulty of diagnosis becomes greatly increased. Peripheral Sarcoma is most frequently mistaken for a deep-seated cliromc abscess, but the absence of true fluctuation, the presence of a rounded edge to the tumour, and its fixed attachment to the bone will usually enable the Surgeon to recognise its true nature. Sometimes the nature of the disease is revealed by the occurrence of spontaneous fracture, as in the case represented in Fio- 535. In all doubtful cases the swelling must be punctured with an

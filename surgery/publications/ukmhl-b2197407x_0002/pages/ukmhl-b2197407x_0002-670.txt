Complete Excision of the Upper Jaw.-The operation of excision of tne whole of the upper jaw, together with the malar bone, for tumour of the antrum was first proposed by Lizars in 1826 ; though Gensoul of Lyons was tne nrst burgeon by whom the opei-ation was actually performed, in May wn bince then, it has been practised repeatedly; and the names of Listen and ot ±ergusson are inseparably connected with it, for the skill with which they devised, and the boldness with which they carried out, the various steps of its performance. The patient should be placed in a recumbent position with the head and shoulders well raised by pillows, opposite a good light. The Surgeon stands at hrst on the same side as the bone to be removed, but during the sawing he will find It convenient to stand always on the right side, returning to the left, if that be the affected side, during tlie final stages of the operation. H«mor- rhage during the operation is one of the chief difficulties, not only on account of the actual loss of blood that may take place, but from the risk of asphyxia from the blood finding its way into the larynx. In order to prevent this accident the throat must frequently be wiped out during the operation with sponges fixed upon proper holders, Annandale has recommended that the operation should be done with the patient's head hanging over the end of the table, so that any blood that runs backwards may accumulate in the upper part of the pharynx, whence it can be removed from time to time with a sponge. This position, however, tends to aggravate the hEemorrhage, and is not to be recommended when the tumour is very vascular. It will often be found useful to plug the posterior nares with a good-sized sponge passed behind the soft palate in the way already described, before commencing the operation. This tends - to push the soft palate forwards, and may embarrass the breathing. Should this happen, a large tube of some kind, such as a lithotomy tube, may be passed between the root of the tongue and the soft palate through which respiration can be readily carried on. During the operation a good-sized sponge, attached to a piece of string, may be placed in the mouth on the side on which the operation is being performed, care being taken to leave a sufficient space for the passage of air in respiration. It must be remembered, that the patient does not require the whole mouth to

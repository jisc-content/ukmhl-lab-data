TUBERCULOUS HIP DISEASE:' EXCISION. 437 Those portions of bone which have necrosed are usually lying loose, or else may generally be readily separated by the finger, or by the handle of a scalpel, from the subjacent soft structures. Fig. 576 represents the result obtained in a girl from whom I removed the upper end of the thigh-bone, the acetabulum, the rami of the pubes and of the ischium, a portion of the tuber ischii, and part of the dorsum ilii. This patient, when admitted into the Hospital, was in the last stage of disease, exhausted by constant discharge, and must inevitably have speedily sunk had no effort been made to remove the cause of prostration. At the operation she was so exhausted that it was necessary to leave her on the operating-table for Fig. 576.â€”Eesult of Excision for Extensive Acetabular Di.sease, three years after Operation. some hours before she was sufficiently restored to bear moving into bed. Nevertheless, by the free use of stimulants and nourishing food, she improved rapidly ; and when she recovered, the limb presented the appearance in the drawing: it was straight, shortened about two inches; good movement existed at the hip ; and she could walk with much ease. Constitutionally, she was in perfect health, and continued so up to the time when she was last seen, about fourteen years after the operation. In three other cases I have successfully removed large portions of the acetabdum and of the contiguous portions of the iHum and ischium. In cases such as these, if they are left to them- selves, the result must inevitably be fatal. There is no danger of laying open the pelvic cavity during the removal of these masses of pelvic bone ; for, during the progress of the disease the fascia and muscles lining the pelvis become so thickened that they form a barrier which effectually protects the pelvic cavity In children a double Thomas's splint is the most convenient apparatus for

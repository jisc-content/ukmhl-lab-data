In other cases, though much more rarely, it seems to be formed by a thickenmg^of the transversalis fascia in the inner ring, but altogether outside the sa£ Occasionally it is met with in some part of the canal, at the lower edge of the internal oblique, but much more frequently at the external abdominal ring. , , . . Congenital Hernia when strangulated does not commonly admit of reduc- tion, and thus necessarily renders an opei-ation imperative. The procedure is more commonly required for this kind of hernia in adults than in infants Tha operation is the same as that for acquired hernia, but the parts concerned are'usually thinner ; hence more cauti-on than usual is required in these cases. The tunica vaginalis commonly contains a large quantity of fluid, clear or dark m colour, according to the severity of the strangulation. The stricture will always be found in the neck of the sac, and appears to be fonned by the im- perfect contraction of that portion of the funicular prolongation of" the peri- toneum, which normally becomes obliterated before birth, and establishes the separation between the two serous sacs of the tunica vaginalis and of the peritoneum. As the congenital hernia is always external to the epigastric vessels, the section of the stricture may be done with perfect safety in a direction upwards and outwards, though, if the Surgeon should have any doubt as to the exact nature of the case, it will be better to divide the stricture directly upwards. The reduction of the contents of the hernia may in the adult be prevented by adhesions in the neck of the sac, or between them and the testis. I have found both the gut and the omentum closely incorporated with this organ, and requiring some nice dissection to separate them. In operating upon infants of a very tender age, much caution will necessarily be required, on account of the thinness of the coverings, their tension, and the small size

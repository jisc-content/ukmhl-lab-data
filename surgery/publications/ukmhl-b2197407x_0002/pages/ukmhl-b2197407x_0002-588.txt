556 DEFORMITIES OF THE LE(1 AND FOOT.

(u.O) should be entered immediately in front of the anterior border of the mterual malleolus, the blade as far as possible being kept between the ligaments to be divided and the superjacent skin. The blade is then turned against the surface of the ligament, and, by means of a gentle sawing action 18 made to divide it. As the superficial fibres are divided, deeper ones come into play, and must in their turn be divided until bone is reached. By keeping the knife close to the bones and directing its point towards the plantar aspect, the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament can easily be divided. In this operation the tendon of the tibialis posticus will almost certainly be cut, and not improbably that also of the tibialis anticus. The long and short plantar ligaments can mosti effectually be reached just where theyj pass between the two bones. A straight! tenotome (Fig. 651) must be entered" nearly as possible over the calcaneo-cuboidi articulation on the outer edge of the foot. If there be much inversion this point will appear to be on the sole of the foot. The I blade must be kept close to the bone and '• made to follow the direction of thej articulation. In this manner, the two ligaments, mostly blended together* at this point, will be divided simultaneously." In cases in which the^ extension of the foot is extreme, Parker finds it sometimes useful to- divide the posterior ligament of the ankle-joint. " This is best accomplished! by means of a small spear-headed knife (Fig. 653), which should be passed] through the tendo Achillis in the direction of its fibres, and then turnedf flatways, and passed through the posterior ligament about its middle, cutting first on one side and then on the other." After the operation the foot should) be fixed in plaster of Paris in the best attainable position for about a fortnight. The plaster should then be removed and a light wooden splint with a rect- angular foot-piece applied and taken off daily in order that rubbing and manipulation may be practised. Complicated appliances, such as " Scarpa's shoe " and " Aveling's talivert," which are intended to correct the deformity by the action of screws and joints, have been largely abandoned in favour of simple splints of tin, wood, or plaster of Paris. In 1884, Phelps of New York brought forward a more radical method for the Figs. 650, 651, 652, 653.—Tenotomes for Division of Tarsal Ligaments (Parker).

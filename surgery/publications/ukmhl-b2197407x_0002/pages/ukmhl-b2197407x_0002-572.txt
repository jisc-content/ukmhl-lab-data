A corresponding longitudinal incision IS now made along the dorsal surface of the middle finger, but comes rather urther down on the hand. The two transverse incisions at its upper and ower ends are next made ; the flap thus defined is dissected back, and wl. the knife reaches the mid-line of the web the two fingers will be found to I.'- separated. 5. The next and last step of the operation is to wrap each flap J Fig. 638.—Diagram of Flaps. Didot's Operation for Webbed Finger. Fig. 639.—«.

The FLii applied to the Fingers, and covering in tije raw and exposed surfaces. round the raw surface of the finger to which it continues to be attached, and to fix it in position by a sufficient number of horsehair or fine catgut stitches Thus the raw surface on the index finger will be covered by the flap taken from the dorsum of the middle and vice versa, as is seen in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 638). . In the accompanying cut (Fig. 639), transverse sections of the fingers are shown. The operation should not be undertaken at too early an age, as the small size of the parts makes it difficult to do it efficiently. It is doubtful also if the result in after-life is always satisfactory. I have known of a case in which the scars in the site of the divided webs seemed, by contraction and want of growth, to have led to deformity of the fingers even more crippling than the original webbing, and ultimately necessitating partial amputation of one finger which was hopelessly distorted and flexed into the palm. If two fingers only are webbed, they may be left until the hand is fully grown before operation. If the uniting web is thin the above operation is impracticable, and the method devised by Zeller will be found useful. This consists in raising a

"'^^'"'f' f"^'^^ ^^^^"P^-- ^he affections to wS specirworks ' ' information the student must refer to The diseases of the middle ear are commonly classed under the following headings : Simple Mucous Catarrh and Purulent Catarrh, and each of thel is divided into acute and chronic. Simple Acute Catarrh is usually associated with catarrhal affections of the pharynx, and is most common in children. It is characterized by acute hypenemia and swelling of the mucous membrane with increased secretion of mucus. Difficulty of hearing is an early symptom, and in some cases there is intense ear-ache radiating over the side of the head. Noises and throbbing in the ear are seldom absent. Examination of the ear shows the external meatus clear, some redness of the membrana tympani, with bulging in some cases. If left unrelieved the membrane occasionally perforates, after which cure takes place and the aperture heals, or the disease may become chronic. The Treatment in mild cases consists in the application of leeches behind the ear, and hot fomentations externally. At the same time the air should be blown into the tympanum at intervals by means of Politzer's bag ; the mucus will usually escape when the air regurgitates from the cavity. If there is much bulging and acute pain, relief can be obtained more surely, and the risk of permanent damage to the ear avoided by puncturing the membrane by means of a small lancet-shaped knife specially constructed for this purpose, or a cataract needle. This operation is easy of performance ; the speculum having been passed, and a good view of the membrane obtained, the puncture is to be made at the lower part of the membrane behind the handle of the malleus. The mucus may then be blown out by means of air-douches from Politzer's bag or through the Eustachian catheter. The operation is usually followed by com plete relief, and the small puncture soon heals, leaving the hearing unimpaired

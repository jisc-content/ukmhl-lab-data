Tuberculous Ulceration of the rectum is not common, except the limited form which IS frequently present around the internal opening of a tuberculous nstula. ihe primary deposit in such cases probably occurs in the submucous tissue. In rare instances the ulceration is progressive and attended with much surrounding thickening ; to such a form the term " lupoid " has been applied. Harrison Cripps has described two cases of this nature, in which the resem- Diance to carcmoma was very close. The Treaimmt consists in thoroughly scraping the surface and applying chloride of zinc (40 grs. to 3 j) and iodoform'; or excision of the ulcer may be required.

The Surgeon, standing on the right side of the patient, is faced by his assistant on the opposite side of the table. Operation.—No definite rule can be laid down as to the length of the incision, beyond stating thnt while necessarily proportionate to the size and nature of the tumour, it should in all cases be as limited as possible. A small cut, two or three inches long, extending in the mid-line to within an inch of the pubes, will suffice for the removal of any simple cyst ; and, if necessary, may readily be prolonged upwards.

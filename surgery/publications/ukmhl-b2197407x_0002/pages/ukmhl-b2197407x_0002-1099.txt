This is an additional reason for injecting the bladdei before "^ttudrm, lateral lithotomy presents certain special difficulties whi^^^^^^^^^^ already been adverted to. These are : 1, the Surgeon missing he blato and opening up the recto-vesical space (p. 1058) ; 2, not opening the ^re hra and neck of the bladder sufficiently with the knife, but pushing ^ P^^^^^^^f^ ' the finger, and so tearing across the urethra, and thus ^^^cessarily being unable to complete the operation (p. 1060) ; and 3, running the knife too far along the groove of the staff into the bladder, and thus wounding the posterior part of that organ. t •ii,«+/>«,w Sources of Danger and Causes of Death after Lateral 3;^*1^«*<>^^^ -It will be convenient to describe here only the special dangers ot the lateral operation. The influence of kidney disease on the results of lithotomy nas already been mentioned at p. 1047, and the effect of age will be subsequently considered. , i,qK1v The Shock of the Operation occasionally proves fatal, thougb prooau y much less fi-equently since the introduction of chloroform than was formerly the case. Yet, even now, patients occasionally die from this cause, induced either by a very much prolonged operation, or by the system being weakened in consequence of disease of the kidneys, perhaps of a latent character. Hemorrhage does not prove fatal so often as might be expected from the great vascularity of the parts incised. Secondary haemorrhage, of a dangerous or even fatal character, may, however, come on six, eight, or ten days after the operation. I have known it as late as the fourteenth day. It must be borne in mind that, when hsemorrhage takes place after the operation, the blood may find its way into the bladder, distending it with coagula, but not giving any external evidence of the mischief that has occurred. Secondary hsemorrhage will usually cease on plugging the wound with sponge or lint soaked in alum

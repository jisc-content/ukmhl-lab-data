Ut the 72 cases of moderate-sized hernia recorded by Banks, the result after long periods, was known in 47 cases ; in 37 it was completely successful, m 8 par- ?fally s;ccessful, and in 2 unsuccessful. Of the 262 ^P— P^^/^^^^^ by Bassini, 108 were known to be followed by a cure without ^^e use of a truss after periods varying from one to four years. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that the operation should not be indiscriminately recommended in all cases, and Banks's rule is undoubtedly a wise one-that it should not be undertaken when the hernia can be kept up without discomfort by a truss. _ Operation for Strangulated Inguinal Hernia.-When the hernia is strangulated, if the taxis properly employed in the direction of the canal have failed, the operation must be performed in the following way : ihe pubes having been shaved, the patient should be brought to the edge of bea ; and the Surgeon, having the skin covering the external ring well pinched up, divides the fold in the usual way, by an incision two inches in length com- mencing about half an inch above the external abdominal ring. Should any spouting vessel, as the external pudic, be divided in this incision, it must be secured at once. The Surgeon then proceeds to divide the various covenngs of the hernia layer by layer until the sac is reached. The thickness of the coverings varies much in difierent cases, and is often considerable when the hernia is old and the patient has long worn a truss. In some cases the mter- columnar fibres form a thick band across the external ring, and the cremasteric lascia is usually readily recognizable. Wlien this is divided the transversahs fascia and subserous areolar tissue, or fascia propria, will be laid bare, and may form a thickened vascular layer. If the hernia has not protruded beyond the external abdominal ring, it may be necessary to slit up the external oblique.

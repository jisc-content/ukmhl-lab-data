Hunter mentions the case of a "ri who had been two years in the Magdalen Hospital, and w^^ nerson with whom she had connexion immediately after she left that mstitu tfon ihe persistence of the contagion of gleet is, it is true, more marked m women than in men. The long persistence of contagion is m ^«««^<i;^^th f ^ fact that gonococci have been found in the urethral discharge many months or even several years after the commencement of the disease. The Fesence of the gonococcus may be taken as proof that the discharge is still infectious, but on the other hand, failure to demonstrate the organism can hardly justify the'surgeonin pronouncing the patient free from any risk of causing mfection So longt indeed, as any discharge continues from the male urethra, though it be but a daily drop, the patient must be looked upon as infectious. The importance of this subject is obvious, and it seems certain that many inflam- matory affections of the pelvic organs occurring in newly-married women are due to infection by an apparently insignificant urethral discharge m the husband. j i. „ The severity and the continuance of gonorrhoea are often opposed to one another Thus the disease is most severe in young and plethoric persons, and in first attacks; but it is most difficult of cure in strumous constitutions, more especially if there be a gouty or rheumatic tendency co existing, and it is very troublesome to remove after repeated attacks. I have observed repeatedly that it is very apt to degenerate into a gleet in people who are subject to chronic eczema. . There is a form of chronic gleet which continues very persistently after an attack of gonorrhoeal epididymitis. In these cases the discharge is not so much urethral as testicular. It appears to proceed from the increased exuda- tion from the mucous membrane of the secretory and efferent structures ot the testis, during the process of resolution of the inflammation. The length of time that the infection of gleet will continue in both sexes, but especially in the female, makes it somewhat difficult to say whether the poison of gonorrhoea can be generated de novo, as it is not improbable that many individuals communicate the disease, believing themselves to be perfectly cured, though still sufl'ering from slight gleet. Gleet.—The term gleet is applied to any mucous or muco-purulent discharge, which is very small in amount and persists for an indefinite time unaccom- panied by any other obvious symptoms. This condition is one which gives rise to great mental uneasiness in many patients, and some varieties are, moreover, liable to terminate in stricture if unrelieved. The correct diagnosis of its nature and source is, therefore, of extreme importance. In the first place, it is necessary to remember that in young men a somewhat copious flow of mucus is apt to accompany an erection of the penis. When, as is frequently the case,

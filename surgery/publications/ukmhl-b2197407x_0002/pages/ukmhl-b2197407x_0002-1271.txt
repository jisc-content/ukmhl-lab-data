INFANTILE HYDROCELE. ^239 of li.ht through it may not be perceived unless the examination be conducted a darkened room, or it may even become completely opaque^ t m^^^^^ n be forgotten that in inputs a hernia may be translucent on account thinness of the structures at that age. 1 ^ vaginalis We have already seen that the ordinary hydrocele of_ the ^^^^^^ may vary as to size : it may also diflFer as to shape ; m some cases be n gl" in others constricLd in the middle, or of an hour-glass shape ^^The'quantity of hquid varies considerably ; there are usually from six to twelve or twenty ounces, but I have known a hydrocele to contain more than ne hundred an'd twenty ounces.

In very large and old hydroceles the fluid may become of a dark-brownish or chocolate hue, owing to ^^e admixture of disintegrated blood; and it will then be found to contain flakes of cholestenne The sac is usually thin ; but in some old cases it becomes thick and dense lined by a kind of false membrane, and divided by septa or bands, occasionally to such an extent as almost to separate it into distinct compartments. When the sac is thick, and the fluid opaque and turbid, there may be considerable difficulty in detecting the translucency. . The testis is often somewhat enlarged, especially about the epididymis, and frequently slightly tender, more particularly in the early stages of the complaint. It is almost invariably situated in the posterior part at the sac (Fio- 944), but may sometimes be found towards its anterior part. When this is the case, the epididymis will be found turned towards the front, owing to the organ being retroverted. If the hydrocele is of any size and tense, the testicle is lost in it. Its situation can then be recognized by the characteristic pain elicited by pressing on it, and by the opacity of the tumour at that ^Â°Two uncommon varieties of hydrocele of the tunica vaginahs need short mention. In the so-called Congenital Hydrocele, the funicular portion of the processus vaginalis having remained unobliterated, the sac of the hydrocele is in communication with the peritoneal cavity, and the fluid occupies the same position as the intestine does in a so-called congenital hernia. It differs from an ordinary vaginal hydrocele only in the fact that by raising the tumour and gently squeezing it the fluid can be gradually made to flow back into the general peritoneal cavity. The name Infantile Hydrocele has been applied to a hydrocele of the tunica vaginahs in which the funicular process has been obliterated only at the internal abdominal ring and remains patent below. The hydrocele has therefore a narrow prolongation above which occupies the inguinal canal. The extension of swelling into the inguinal canal and the consequent existence of a slight impulse on coughing render this variety of hydrocele more easily mistaken for hernia than the ordinary form ; it is, however, distinguished by its translucency, irreducibility, dulness on percussion, and distinct fluctuation.

In slight cases of prolapse, in which the disease appears rather to be owing to the relaxation of the sphincter and of the tissues external to it, the muco-cutaneous integument hanging in loose folds around the anus, considerable benefit will commonly result from snipping ott these pendulous flaps of skin with curved-edged scissors in a direction radiating trom the anus ; the cut surface that is left cicatrizes, and by its contraction braces up the part, and thus prevents its further protrusion. When the prolapse is considerable, and the ordinary palliative treatment after a proper trial fails in eflFecting a cure, it will be necessary to remove the protruded mucous membrane by operation. This may be done by the applica- tion of the ligature, or by the clamp and cautery. Whitehead's operation is well suited to these cases. Should the prolapse become strangulated, it would be necessary to try to reduce it through the sphincter by taxis ; if this cannot be accomplished,'free incisions may be made into it; if it be not reduced, it will slough away, and thus undergo permanent cure.

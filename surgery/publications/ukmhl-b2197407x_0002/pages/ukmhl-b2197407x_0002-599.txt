BOW-LEG. 567 pavatively seldom, however, that any operative interference is required in these cases. Should it be, the remarks that have been made at pages 538 and ,330, in reference to the treatment of these conditions in the hand, are equally applicable here. . Congenital Hypertrophy of the Toes and Foot, as represented in Figs. 660 and 661, occasionally occurs. This malformation is of necessity incurable. Weak Ankles not uncommonly occur in rickety children ; the hgaments being relaxed, the joints appearing to be swollen, and the child being unable to walk or stand without great difficulty. In these circumstances, attention to the state of the general health, douching with salt water, with the applica- tion of an elastic india-rubber bandage round the ankle, or the use of light iron supports, will be found most useful. - Bow-Leg is often associated with weak ankles. The tibia is bent with the r concavity looking towards the opposite leg. In some cases the shaft of the ( bone is curved, but in the majority the bend will be found to be situated at I the junction of the lower epiphysis with the shaft, the foot at the same time ' being turned somewhat out, in the position of valgus. This deformity is in . some cases rickety, but in the majority of instances it is purely mechanical, owing to the child, especially if heavy and overfed, having been put on its feet at too early an age or for too long a time. , The Treatment consists in careful attention to diet and the avoidance of i fattening food, giving the child rest, and in the application of a pair of light ? well-padded wooden splints to the inner side of the leg, taking their bearing- . points from the inner condyle of the femur and the inner malleolus. These should be worn only at night.

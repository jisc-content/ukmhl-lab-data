It is not uncommon, moreovei, ^^la^tice to meet with cases in which the patient has been unab e to empty his bladder completely for many months in consequence of prostatic disease ana yet the urine has remained acid and free from decomposition throughout ; at iast a catheter is passed, and within three days the urine is decomposing and strongly ammoniacal. Cases are, however, not unfrequently met with m which the urine is foul, and yet no instrument has ever been passed In these ttie explanation suggested is that the mucus secreted as the result of_ cystitis hangs in the urethra, which is not washed clean at every act of micturition and constantly forms a channel of communication between the external air and tne bladder by means of which decomposition may extend into the bladder. U rine which is mixed with a considerable proportion of alkaline mucus decomposes far more readily than the healthy secretion. >^ .^ a- The constitutional symptoms of chronic cystitis are chiefly due to the ms- turbance at night and want of rest, unless the urine is allowed to become foul. If this happen, the ordinary symptoms of chronic septic poisoning usually manifest themselves—irregular febrile disturbance, loss of appetite, foul tongue, and progressive emaciation. Chronic cystitis is not unfrequently fatal, death resulting in most cases from septicaemia, or from extension of decomposition to the urme in the ureters and pelves of the kidneys with suppurative nephritis. These condi- tions are accompanied by the symptoms already described. Occasionally, in old patients, the constant disturbance may cause death by exhaustion. The Treatment of chronic cystitis must always have reference to its cause. If it be due to stone or stricture no permanent improvement can be obtained till these causes are removed, but before undertaking this, if the symptoms are verging on those of the acute form, hot hip-baths, fomentations, mucila- ginous drinks, hyoscyamus with alkalies, and especially potash, will be found most useful. The bowels must be kept regular by enemata or castor oil. If there should be strangury, morphia or belladonna suppositories will give most relief. By these means the disease may be prevented from assuming the form of chronic v,esical catarrh ; but in order to ensure this it is most important that decomposition of the urine should be prevented, or if it have already com- menced that it should be arrested. For the prevention of the decomposition all instruments should be washed in carbohc acid lotion (1 in 40) before being

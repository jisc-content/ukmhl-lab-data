Tubuli Seminiferi: A part of the round-celled growth beginning to undergo fatty degeneration (ISO diam.). may confidently be hoped for ; although relapses are of frequent occurrence. In the more advanced stages, the prognosis is not so hopeful, for, although under proper treatment the new growth may be absorbed, the gland will remain shrunken, puckered, and indurated. This is only what would be expected ; for the tubuli seminiferi, as above stated, become more or less extensively destroyed by the pressure of the new growth in the later stages of the disease. The Treatment is that recommended in Chapter XXXYI. for constitutional syphihs. Locally, the hydrocele may be tapped (but on no account injected), and pressure may be applied, by strapping over some mercurial ointment. Diagnosis of the Simple, Tuberculous, and Syphilitic Enlargements. —The diagnosis of these affections is in some cases easy, in others very difiS- cult. Whatever the form of disease may be, if it be complicated by hydrocele, this may first be tapped in order that the gland may be accurately examined. The hydrocele in these cases may not be translucent, as the tunica vaginalis is often thickened. It must be remembered that hydrocele is a very rare complication of carcinoma, or of adenoma ; it is rare with tuberculous disease; less rare with simple chronic orchitis, and very common with syphilitic disease.

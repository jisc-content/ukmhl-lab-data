If reddened by extraYasabion of blood it is an fv dence of increased congestion; and the deeper the discoloration, the browner the more muddy the fluid, the greater probably has been the conges- tion or inflammation of the strangulated parts. In some instances scarcely any fluid exists ; and then it becomes necessary to proceed with extreme caution in opening the sac, as the gut or omentum is applied close^ to i s inner wall In such cases as these the sac is not unfrequently sufficiently translucent to enable the Surgeon to see its contents through it; and he should then open it over the omentum, or any small mass of fat which he may observe shining through it. The opening, when once made into the sac, may be extended by the introduction of a broad director (Fig. 798), upon which it is to be slit up to a sufficient extent to allow the examination of its contents. ... ,• ■ 1.1., j- • Division of the Stricture.—The next point m the operation is the divi- sion of the stricture ; and this requires considerable care, lest injury be done to the neighbouring parts of importance, or the gut be wounded. Vessels and structures in the vicinity of the stricture are avoided by dividing it m a proper direction, in accordance with ordinary anatomical considerations, which will be described when we come to speak of the special forms of rupture. All injury to the intestine is prevented by introducing the index finger of the left hand up to the seat'of stricture, insinuating the finger-nail underneath it, and divid- in^-- the constriction by means of a hernia-knife having a very limited cutting ed'c'rc (Fig. 71)0). If a director be used to guide the knife, the intestine will be in'consid'erabie danger, as the instrument may be slid under that portion of it

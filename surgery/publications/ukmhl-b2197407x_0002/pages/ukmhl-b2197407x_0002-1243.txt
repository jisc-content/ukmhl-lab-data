By this operation a wide raw surface from each side is brought into contact, instead of a mere raw edge of cut Fig. 929.—Urethroplasty. Clark's Operation : First Stage. Fig. 930.—Urethroplasty.

In all operations of this kind union will be promoted by keeping the part constantly bathed with a concentrated cold solution of boric acid. In this way decomposition of any mucus or urine that may accidentally find its way to the wound is prevented, and at the same time the lotion is so unirritating that it does not interfere with union. The lotion is best applied by means of a piece of boric acid lint, which must be frequently wetted and changed. If the urine can be efficiently kept from the wound, a dry dressing of iodoform or salicylic wool will be found the best. Stricture of the Female Urethra is rare. When it occurs, it is usually near the external orifice, and is most commonly the result of gonorrhoea, injury during labour, or syphilis. The symptoms are the ordinary ones of irritability of the bladder, frequent desire to micturate, and some difficulty or delay in doing so. The Treatment consists in the dilatation of the orifice by means of Hegar's dilators.

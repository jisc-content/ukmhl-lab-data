Such a hernia would be analogous to the con- genTtai''variety in the male, although there are no anatomical differences by which it can be distinguished from an acquired hernia. _ • i v • Besides the contents commonly found in hernial sacs, an inguinal hernia in the female may contain the ovary. Fallopian tube, or utems (See Chap LXXIY ) It occasionally happens that an unobliterated portion ot the canal of Nuck becomes distended with fluid, and may be mistaken for an inguinal hernia, especially if a communication still exists with the peritoneal cavity, so that the fluid is reducible. Among the conditions which have been mistaken for a labial hernia may be mentioned lipoma, cysts, and varicose veins of the labium. , Treatment—When an inguinal hernia is reducible, the rupture must be kept up by a well-made truss, the pad of which, of an oval shape, should press not only upon the external ring, but upon the whole length of the canal. In this way a reducible hernia may occasionally be cured, and m young children in whom this result is frequently obtained, the truss should be worn constantly. When a truss is used in the treatment of an irreducible hernia it should be provided with a hollow cup-shaped pad or a suspensory bag, according to the size of the rupture. The chief points relating to the choice of cases suitable for attempting a radical cure by operation have been con- sidered at page 829. For reducible inguinal hernia operation may be under- taken in children and adults if a properly made truss fails to keep up the rupture, and in cases where the use of a truss proves a serious inconvenience to the patient. Irreducible hernias, unless of very large size, are usually suit- able for operation ; but in all cases the patient's health must be satisfactory, and the age not too advanced. Radical Cure of Inguinal Hernia.—It is unnecessary to enter into the history of the operations undertaken for the cure of inguinal hernia. Among the methods which have almost universally been abandoned may be mentioned the injection of irritants into or around the sac with the object of setting up adhesive inflammation in it, and the closure of the inguinal canal by the invagination of a plug of the scrotal tissues into it, as in the operation practised by Wutzer, of Bonn. Mention must also be made of the subcutaneous method, which was devised by Wood and extensively practised by him with

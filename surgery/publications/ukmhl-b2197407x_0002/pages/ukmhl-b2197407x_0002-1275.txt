TREATMENT OF HYDROCELE: INCISION AND DRAINAGE. 1243 about sufficient inflammation.

Thus, Martin stated that in India the failures scarcely amount to 1 ce^t ' Velpeau calculated them at 3 per cent. I am not aware that any statistics of this'mode of treatment in this country have been collected ; but the general opinion of Surgeons would appear to be decidedly m its favour, being the safest plan of treatment that has yet been introduced. In this opinion I fully concui • yet it is by no means improbable that the success of the_ lodme m- iection in this country would prove to be not quite so great as is generally believed. I have seen a considerable number of cases of simple hydrocele ot the tunica vaginalis, both in hospital and in private practice m which a radical cure had not been eifected, although recourse had been had to the lodme injection by some of the most careful and skilful Surgeons of the day, as well as by myself. It is especially apt to fail in men advanced m years. , there is either not sufficient inflammation excited, or if it be, the fluid that is as a consequence efi'used into the tunica vaginalis is not re-absorbed. Injection of Carbolic Acid.—The use of carbolic acid, instead of lodme, as an injection for hydrocele, has been recommended by Levis of Philadelphia. The advantages claimed for carbolic acid over iodine are that it is more certain and less painful, and also that it produces a more rapid cure with less risk of complications. Le^ns recommends that a drachm of pure carboHc acid be liquefied with 5 or 10 per cent, of glycerine. This is injected through the cannula, by which the fluid has been withdrawn, by means of a large hypodermic syringe. Or the Surgeon may follow Jacobson's suggestion to introduce the needle of an exploring syringe into the hydrocele, then to tap the hydrocele in the ordinary way, and after withdrawing the cannula, to screw the syringe on to the needle which is already in position and inject the liquefied carbolic acid. It cannot yet be considered proved that recurrence is less common after carbolic acid than iodine injections. The danger of carbolic acid poisoning seems to be extremely small. Incision and Drainage.—The simple method of introducing a good- sized di-ainage-tube into the hydrocele and applying an antiseptic dressing has been found frequently to fail to effect a radical cure, the sac refilling after the tube was removed. Free incision was, therefore, recommended by Volkmann. In his operation the sac is incised along its anterior aspect and the fluid evacuated and the cavity washed out with carboHc acid lotion (1 in 20) ; the tunica vaginalis is then attached to the skin by a few points of suture and the parts dressed anti- septically. The operation is not followed by orchitis, and the wound heals in about two weeks. The results have been very satisfactory, but relapses have occurred even after this. I

SACCULATED ANEURISM. in a lesser degree of the inner coat. Afc first, as we have seen, all the coats are l ecognizable in the sac, but soon the middle coat is found only in patches with wide'^gaps between them. With the further increase in the size of the sac all traces of the middle, and usually of the internal, coat are lost, so that the wall is formed of dense fibroid tissue, chiefly derived from the outer coat of the artery. This is strengthened by its adhesion to the neighbouring parts, which become fused into its structure as a consequence of the chronic inflammatory ]irocess set up round the aneurism from the pressure it exerts upon the surrounding structures. In the majority of cases, however, a sacculated aneurism arises in an atheromatous patch in which the internal coat and the innermost layers of tlie middle cont have already been destroyed. In such cases the sac is from the first chiefly formed by the thickened outer coat, and only shows remains of the middle coat in the earliest stages and near the mouth of the sac. The formation of an aneurism by the hernial protrusion of the internal and middle coats through an ulcerated aperture in the external coat has been described ; but, though there is a preparation in the Museum of the College of Surgeons that is supposed to illustrate this fact, I doubt the existence of such a form of the disease, and after careful examination think that the preparation in question represents rather an artificial dissection than a true rupture of this dense and resisting structure. False Sacculated Aneurism.â€” In this variety all the coats of the artery are absent in some part at least of the sac of the aneurism, which is here formed only by the condensed connective tissue of the structures in which the tumour is situated. This variety results from the gradual yielding of the sac of a true sacculated aneurism ; the blood, although effused beyond this, is still confined in a sac of condensed areolar tissue formed by that of the stractures

In peisons who have been the subjects of the chronic dysentery of hot climates, I have several times noticed a peculiar form of patchy ulceration within the lectum, of an extremely irritable and very intractable character. The Symptoms of ulcer or fissure of the anus are very characteristic. iJie patient' complains of pain, usually of a severe burning character, on the passage of a motion, especially if a hard one ; it commonly occurs at the time ot defecation, but occasionally commences a few minutes afterwards, and con- tinues from half-an-hour to several hours. This pain is very severe, and peculiarly wearing and burning ; it is generally most felt opposite the sacro- iliac articulation, but not unfrequently radiates round the pelvis or down the thio-hs In many cases it produces a good deal of continued irritation about the^-enito-urinary organs, giving rise, in the male, to symptoms of spasmodic stricture, a frequent desire to urinate, tenderness about the prostate, ana seminal emissions. The pain is sometimes so severe that the patient avoids defEecation as long a.s possible, and with this object even abstains from taking sufiicient food. Very commonly in women, the pains produced by the rectal disease simulate those occasioned by uterine irritation ; and in both sexes they may after a time become continuous, and be attended with constant uneasiness in sitting, so that the patient is obliged to raise the hip of the affected side. There is often a streak of pus or blood on the feces, and commonly a good •deal of mucous- discharge, with some tenesmus on defcBcation ; but in some instances these symptoms are altogether absent, and the patient suffers no local inconvenience except from the pain. The constitutional irritation is often o-reat : the countenance becomes pale and careworn, and.the expression is indicative of constant suffering. This affection most commonly occurs in ^yomen, especially in those of a weakly constitution and subject to chronic constipation. In some cases it seems to have arisen from injury during labour. When met with in men, it is most frequently seen in debilitated subjects. The typical fissure may always be detected by everting the mucous mem- brane of the anus, and turning aside the pile which covers the lower end of the crack. During this examination it will usually be found that the sphincter is in a more or less spasmodically contracted state, admitting the finger with difficulty. An ulcer within the orifice of the anus will be felt with the finger as a small, soft, velvety patch ; on touching it the patient will usually com- plain of acute and burning pain. It may be brought into view by examining the rectum with a speculum (Figs. 826 and 827), but an ansesthetic will usually be required to do this.

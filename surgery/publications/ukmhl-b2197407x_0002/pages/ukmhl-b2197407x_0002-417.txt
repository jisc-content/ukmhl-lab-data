3^5 EXCISION OF SHOULDER-JOINT. means drainage is certainly facilitated, and the healing of the anterior wound is hastened. Should the extent of the disease or injury prove to be so great as to require amputation of the limb, this may readily be done, as was suggested by Spence of Edinburgh, by carrying the knife round the inner side of the limb, I and so detaching the member, with due attention to those points in connexion I with the axillary artery that have been described in Yol. I., p. 110. The : result, as seen by the annexed drawing (Fig. 549), is very satisfactory. The elliptical operation of excision may be performed in the following ' way. A curved incision is made, commencing at the posterior part of the acromion, reaching downwards to the insertion of the deltoid, and terminating at the outer side of the coracoid process. By a few touches of the scalpel, a large flap composed of the deltoid muscle may thus be raised, and the diseased articulation fully exposed. As in the operation just described, an attempt Fig. 550.- Excision of Shoulder-joint. Elliptical Incision. should be made to save the capsule and maintain its connexion with the periosteum. For this purpose a longitudinal incision should be made through the capsule and it should be stripped off with the tendons and periosteum by means of the periosteal elevator, aided by the knife when necessary. The head being pushed out may then be removed with a narrow saw. The shaft of the humerus should be encroached upon as little as possible, so that the arm may hp rpf. T t^^'' necessary.

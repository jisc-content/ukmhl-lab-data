MALIGNANT DISEASE OF THE UTERUS. 1285 broad ligaments and the vesico-vaginal and recto-vaginal septa with cons^ early impairment of the natural mobility of the uterus.

In the earlier stages of the aflection, attempts were formerly made to arrest its proo-ress by excision or amputation of the cervix, followed by application ot the cautery. Such methods can be of but little use in retarding the progress of the disease, although they may prove beneficial as a means of checking htemorrhage and discharges in cases too advanced for the adoption of more radical measures. In suitable instances, i.e., when the mobility of the uterus is still unimpaired, and no trace of deposit is to be detected in the adjommg tissues, recourse should be had without delay to one or other of the following operations, viz., supra-vaginal excision of the cervix, or complete exiirpakon of the uterus. The former of these consists in the removal not only of the entire cervix, but also of such portion of the uterine tissues above the level of the internal os as may be found implicated by the upward extension of the cervical disease. In this manner almost the entire organ may be excised, leaving merely a shell 01 the uterine wall with its serous covering intact. The earlier steps of the procedure are the same as those required in the operation for complete extirpation of the uterus ; which may, therefore, be at once resorted to should such a course appear desirable. For a full description of the details of both these operations, the reader should consult the works of special writers on this subject, where statistics may be found, showing the relative mortality of the two procedures, and also the degree of protection against recurrence afforded by each one of them. Squamous Carcinoma of the cervix differs essentially from the far more common glajuhdar form of cancer above described, inasmuch as it begins as a surface growth and usually remains for a long time superficial without involving the deeper tissues. The disease originates in tha stratified epithelium investing the vaginal portion of the cervix, or in the transitional cells immediately within the external os uteri ; and tends to spread outwards and downwards on to the vaginal wall. When typically developed, it constitutes an irregular papillo- matous growth—known as a CauUfloiver excrescence—'whAch bleeds readily on being touched. While still limited to the vaginal portion of the cervix, the disease may be eradicated by the operation above referred to as supra-vaginal excision of the neck of the womb ; but if once the broad ligaments have been

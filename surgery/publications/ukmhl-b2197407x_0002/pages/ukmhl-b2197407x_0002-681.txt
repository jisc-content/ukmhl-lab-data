647 EXCISION OF LOWER JAW. left, and attached by an elastic spring to another silver cap put on those of the upper jaw, so as. to prevent the displacement that would otherwise r.ccur in the smaller fragment. Union takes place after a time by fibrous rissue, which becomes sufficiently dense to make the jaw strong and useful. In those cases in which the tumour encroaches upon ihe angle and ramus of the jaw, it is usually better to remove the bone at tlie articulation on the affected side ; for, if the articular end including the coronoid process be left, it will be displaced forwards and upwards by the action of the temporal and external pterygoid muscles, and be a source of much incon- venience to the patient, not compensated by any corresponding ntility. In these cases, the removal of one-half of the jaw will consequently be required, Fig. 6S0.â€”Excision of Lower Jaw. Soft parts raised. and the operation may be performed in the following way. The patient's head must be allowed to fall a little backwards so that the chin may be weU raised from the chest. An incision is then made, commencing near the symphysis, passing along t;he lower border of the body of the jaw as far as the angle and then upwards at the posterior border of the ramus as far as the level of the lobule of the ear. If the tumour be very large it may be necessary to make an incision upwards towards the lip from the anterior end of that just mentioned or even to divide the lip completely, but this should be avoided if possible. The facial artery and vein are wounded in the first incision and must be at once secured. The flap is then raised and the mucous membrane divided along its reflexion from the cheek. If the tumour is simple this inay be partly done with a periosteal elevator, the periosteum being saved ^here it can be safely taken from over the tumour. The knife is then carried

28o INFLAMMATION OF BONE AND ITS EFFECTS. septically If the discharges be allowed to decompose, the danger of the l)atient will be greatly increased. The result of the treatment is to relieve immediately the constitutional symptoms and arrest the progress of tl.e disease, but in a certain proportion of cases general infection may have taken place before the abscess is recognized, and the result is then always fatal. If after the incisions have been made the dis- charge remains very profuse and threatens to exliaust the patient, amputation may sometimes be necessary. In the arm or thigh, as there is only a single bone, a splint must be applied, lest spontaneous fracture should occur. If the shaft of the bone is separated at each end from the epiphyses and lies loose in the cavity of the abscess, it becomes a question whether it should be removed at once or left in the hope that i may partly recover or may at least serve as a support during the formation of the new bone from the periosteum. Numerous cases have been recorded by Holmes, J. Bell, Macnamara and others, m which earlv removal has been practised with excellent results. 512 represents the shaft of the tibia removed in this way by 0. Heath with a most satisfactory result New bone is slowly formed from the periosteum and after a few months the hmb is in most cases almos as strong as before the operation. The removal of the bone ca'n usually be accomplished by simply e>^osing it by a free incision, laying hold of it with the lion foiJps and twisting it out. In some cases the op ra tion is facilitated by dividing the shaft into two pTeces with a saw. If the bone on examination be S to be firmly attached it should be left alone It^ only in those cases in which there is reason to .eheve that the whole^ph;!! is separated from the periosteum and the epiphyses that the operation is justifiable.

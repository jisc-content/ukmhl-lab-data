When distinctly connected with pregnancy the prognosis is much more hopeful. Treatment—lo^m^^ iodide of potassium and iodide of mercury internally, and iodine! lead lotion, belladonna, and many other remedies, externally have been tried without material benefit.

When all other means have failed removal of the enlarged glands becomes justifiable. Only one gland should be removed at a time, partly to avoid shock and excessive loss of blood and partly because improvement in the remaining breast has been noticed in one or two cases. If the base of the tumour is pedunculated it may be surrounded during the operation by an india-rubber band, or secured by a screw-clamp specially made for the case.

In both cases the secretion Avas stimulated by allowing a child to suck at the nipple. Agalactia, or total absence of the secretion of milk after child-birth at the

SEQUELS OF GONORRH(EA: RHEUMATISM-PYjEMIA. 1171 GonorrhcBal Inflammation of the Rectum has already beea described ^'LnorrW Rheumatism principally occurs in young and 0^^^^^^^^ healthv persons. The exact nature of the disease is very supposed by many to be a form of blood-poisomug ana ogous ^0 ^3^--^ Kammerer is said to have found the gonococcus in the fl'^!^ of ^^^^^ ^^'^ affected Avith gonorrhoeal rheumatism, but this observation has not been confirmed by others. Berkeley Hill states that his observations led him 0 beheve that the disease is met with chiefly in gouty or rheumatic ubj'cts If the patient have not previously suffered from these affe^^^^ family history indicating a tendency to them will usually be found in Xts^t are distinctly rheumatic or gouty, Hutchinson ^^f^ ^^ ^^^ urethral discharge, whether specific or not, may give rise to symptoms identical Xtliose of gonorrhcBal rheumatism. The affection is more common m men Than in womeS, and seldom sets in till the third week after the commencemen of the discharge, though it may occur as late as the ^'^^''^.^^^-7 ' disease may assume various forms. It may commence insidiously wi h pain m the joints, quickly followed by considerable effusion^ ^'^^''^^r Jn^hPr affected, but the knee is attacked with far greater frequency than any 0 hei articulation. The febrile disturbance may be slight. The pam and swelhng last usually for some weeks, and gradually subside ; but relapses are common. In other cases the course of the affection more closely resembles that of acute arthritis; the pain is intense, and the ligaments are early affected, itie swelling assumes an oval form, effusion into the articular cavity bemg slight or even wanting. The constitutional distm-bance is severe. This variety most commonly ends in ankylosis. In another form occasionally met with, pam forms the chief symptom, without swelling or interference with movement Other structures beside the joints may be affected, as the fasciae, the sheaths of tendons, bursse, and occasionally the nerves, aonorrhoeal sclerotitis, as_ already mentioned, is always connected with rheumatism, and orchitis may arise from, the same cause. Gonorrhoeal may be distinguished fr'om simple acute rheu- matism by the attack being less severe, by the affection usually being limited to two or three joints, and often to the knee only, and by the absence of the profuse sweating and the creamy-white tongue. The prognosis is, as a rule, good. Suppuration may occasionally take place, and the disease then merges into that immediately to be described, gonorrhoeal pyaemia. Ankylosis is, however, very common, especially in the arthritic form. This arises not ^ so much from destruction of the cartilages, as from shortening and contraction of the inflamed capsule of the joint when recovery takes place. This form of ankylosis is practically incurable. Treatment—The first essential point of treatment is to check the urethral discharge as quickly as possible by the means already described. Iodide of potassium, with alkaline tonics, are sometimes of use. Sahcylate of sodium in large doses has been tried with varying effect. Quinine may be given if the temperature is elevated, and in the later stages perchloride of iron is often of material service. The local joint-affection must be treated by absolute rest on splints, blistering, and strapping over mercurial ointment in the later stages. If ankylosis occurs, it must be treated as described on p. 363. Gonorrhoeal Pyaemia.—It is not easy to draw a clear distinction between gonorrhoeal rheumatism and pya3mia. The term " pyemia " is appHed to those aggravated cases, fortunately of very rare occurrence, in which the joint-affec- 4 F 2

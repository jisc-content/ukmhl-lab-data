Of these .378 were crushed (825 at one sitting), with 14 deaths, or rather over 3^ per cent. In 39 perm^al lithotomy was performed, with 14 deaths, and in 1/ suprapubic lithotomy was performed, with 4 deaths The general result of these figures is to show that when lithotomy was the sole mode of treatment, about 1 in 5 of all adult males operated on died inuring the transition period the death-rate was about 1 in 6 ; since lithotrity 1 in 13-5 ^'^^ operation of choice, it has fallen to aboui It may therefore justly be decided that lithotrity should be the operation undertaken for the treatment of a stone in the bladder of the adult male unless some condition be present which offers a definite contra-indication to Its performance. In this connexion we must consider the character of the stone and the condition of the urinaiy organs. Size and Character of the Stone.—With regard to the size of the stone, there is no doubt that a small stone is more favourable for lithotrity than a large one. All calculi below one inch in diameter may easily be crushed provided no circumstance is present rendering the operation unde- sirable. In regard to larger stones, it is difficult at the present dav to lay down any hard and fast line. Formerly, it was not considered advisable to attempt to crush a stone that was above one inch and a half in diameter ; but since the introduction of Bigelow's method, stones considerably above this size have often been successfully removed. Much will depend on the compo- sition and density of the calculus. The chief objection to lithotrity in large stones was not so much that the stone could not be broken, because unless it was too large to get into the blades of the lithotrite this usually could be done ; but that the mass of fragments to come away by the urethra, and the repeated operations required for their removal generally caused a dangerous amount of irritation. The use of evacuators has overcome these objections for stones of two inches in diameter ; but we are not in a position as yet to say what is the maximum size that can safely be attacked. The different forms of stone vary as regards the ease with which they are broken up. Uric acid calcnli, giving a clearringingsound,donot disintegrate readily,but splitup intosharp and angular spicula and scales. OmJaie of lime calculi, occurring chiefly in young people, break up very readily ; and, as there is usually a co-existing healthy state of the urinary organs, the cases have a favourable issue. PhospJiatic rakuli, which are soft and friable, and do not yield angular fragments requiring repeated disintegration, may, even if of larger size than that mentioned, be broken up. At the same time the patient may often derive great benefit from

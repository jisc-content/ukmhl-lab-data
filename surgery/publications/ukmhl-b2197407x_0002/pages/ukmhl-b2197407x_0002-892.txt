JFig, 803.-Enterotome applied. of an instrument something like a pair of scissors, with blunt but serrated blades, which may be brought together by acting upon a screw that traverses Its handle. One blade of the instrument (a) is passed into the upper, the other {b) into the lower portion of the intestine ; they are then approximated slowly, and fixed by means of the screw in such a way as to compress on each side the spur-like process (Fig. 803). Yery gradually, day by day, this screw is tightened so as to induce sloughing of this projection, and cohesion of its serous surfaces. As this process goes on, the irritation caused by the instru- ment will occasion inflammatory exudation in the angle formed by the. intestine, so that the peritoneum and mesentery become consolidated, and all opening into the peritoneal cavity is avoided. Should the spur-Hke process be accidentally cut through before the lymph is thrown out in sufficient quantity, the peritoneum would be opened, and death would probably ensue ; hence the necessity for caution in this procedure. As soon as the blades of the instrument have come into contact, and the spur-like process has consequently sloughed away, the great obstacle to the closure of the artificial anus will

This is not the case after Hthotomy; when a patient once recovers his bladder usually regains its tone completely, and no trace of evil consequences is left. Treatment—In the event of a secondary calculus forming, whether after hthotomy or hthotrity, either method may again be employed, according to the nature of the case. As a rule, the bladder may be cleared of the recurrent calculus by means of the hthotrite. If hthotomy be performed the suprapubic method is probably the best, even though the primary stone had been removed from the perineum. The scarring and altered relations ot the parts would probably render a repetition of the perineal operation ditticult, and if the rectum have become adherent to the membranous por- tion of the urethra and the apex of the prostate, in consequence of the contraction of the old cicatrix, the danger of woundino- the bowel would be considerable. UEETHHAL CALCULUS. Calculi are not unfrequently found impacted in the urethra, especially in boys. They are most commonly formed in the kidney, whence they pass into the bladder, and thence into the urethra, through which they usually escape ; but in some instances they lodge in the latter channel, more especially at the bulb or in the navicular fossa. These calcuh are mm in only of the uric acid or oxalate of lime varieties ; they are generally round, but not uncommonly elongated or spindle-shaped. There can be little doubt, however, that in some more rare cases calcuh may be formed primarily in the urethra. They will then be found to be phosphatic, usually consequent upon stricture, and perhaps of large size. In some cases these concretions are moulded in the prostatic and bulbous portions of the urethra, being elongated, rounded at one end, and pointed at the other. In other instances, again, they appear to be formed in a pouch that lies to the outside of the urethra, and is connected with it only by a small aperture. I have removed a stone of this kind composed of triple phosphate, weighing an ounce, and about the size of a walnut, smooth and rounded, from a point lying between the ujDper wall of the urethra and the symphysis pubis, in a clergyman who had for many years suflFered from very tight stricture. One of the most remarkable instances of this kind is represented in Fig. 895, taken from a drawing in Carswell's collection at University College. The stone here was of very large size—equal in bulk to two horse-chestnuts.

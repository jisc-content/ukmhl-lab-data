They may be left Tfoi^rcl four to five days, and should be covered with some smrple antiseptic dressing to diminish the risk of ulceration. After they are removed the punc- tures must be covered with collodion. Macewen has employed acupuncture in the following way One or more fine needles long enough to reach across the sac, are introduced and are left in foi twenty-four or thirty-six hours, during which time the position of the point of the pin is frequently shifted, so that it may come in contact with different parts of the inner surface of the sac. The treatment usually needs repetition and no anesthetic is required : antiseptic precautions must be observed. Macewen has recorded four cases in which this method was adopted, ihe first case was an aortic aneurism, which ended fatally by its pressure on the trachea a month after the treatment was commenced ; pms had been intro- duced on seven occasions, and at the post-mortem the sac was found to be two- thirds filled with white, firm, laminated thrombus. The second case was a laro-e femoral aneurism which was cured by this method combined with compression of the common iliac artery for two hours, after compression alone a fortnight previously had failed. In the third case an aneurism of the upper part of the abdominal aorta was cured after acupuncture had been used on three occasions. The relations of the stomach and intestines to the surface of the sac were first determined by inflating them with gas. The patient was in good health two and a half years after the treatment. The fourth case was one of intrathoracic aneurism projecting above the clavicle and probably involving the left subclavian ; it was accompanied by oedema, pain and loss of power in the left arm. Acupuncture was performed four times in a month, and on five occasions four months later. The improve- ment was gradual, and twenty-two months after the treatment was commenced the patient was performing her ordinary duties, the use of the arm being I

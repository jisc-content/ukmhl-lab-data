Chronic intussusception occurs far more frequently in adults than in children. In GO per cent the- invagination occurs at the ileo-ca^cal valve. In some cases it is associated witli the presence of a tumour of the bowel. The 8ymi,ioim of chronic • intussusception are often very anomalous. The invasion is not usually veryt sudden and as the lumen of the bowel is not completelv occluded, nor thei strangulation sufficient to cause shock or gangrene of the gut, the other sic/ns of intussusception may be more or less wanting. The constipation is Sot complete; there may even be diarrhoea, or alternate constipation and diarrhoea. - Vomiting is slight and intermittent, and the pain paroxysmal and colicky.; ienesmus is absent in most cases ; in about half there is no blood or mucusi in the stools. There is usually little distension of the.abdomen ; but if the case last long enough some hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the bowel above the obstruction may take place and the coils may then be distinctly visible through the thin abdominal wall. In about half the recorded casea i the characteristic tumour has been recognized. The general health suflFers considerably, the appetite is bad, and the patient gradually loses flesh and i strength. The duration of chronic intussusception is usually at least two or three mouths, and Treves mentions one case in which it extended to one year. The patient may die merely from exhaustion, or complete obstruction may set in and prove fatal. In some cases perforation of the gut above the obstruction has been the immediate cause of death. Recovery by separation of the intussusceptum is infinitely rare. Relative Frequency of the Various Forms of Intestinal Obstruc- tion.—Bryant has published the following statistics on this point, derived I'rom the records of (luy's Hospital, and collected chiefly by the late Hilton Fagge. The obstructions caused by disease of the rectum and by chronic peritonitis are included. The total number of cases was 124. Of these 8a were acute, 70 chronic, and IT) were due to intussusception. Of the 83 acute cases, 1 was. due to internal hernia, 7 to volvulus, and 25 to strangulation by bands. Of, the 25 bands, 14 were old adhesions, 6 were connected with diverticula from the ileum, 2 with the vermiform appendix, 2 with the neck of a hernial sac,, and 1 with the pedicle of an ovarian tumour. Of the 7(1 cases of chronic obstruction, 8 resulted from feecal impaction, 3 from pressure of tumours, 47 from stricture, and 28 from matting together of the intestinal coils from

The Longitudinal, or, as it is sometimes called, the Pleslxy pile is generally met with about an inch up the rectum. It is spongy elastic fi™ or tough, of a dark-reddish or dusky-brown tint, tapering up;a df f^-om a' broad base It seldom bleeds or varies much in size ; betfveen the p^es ar found small valves, or folds of mucous membrane, forming pouches, wSf he concavities looking upwards. These are apt to become distended Ind pressed downwards by the f^ces, especially if the motions be hard and the boS hav^ been constipated, thus giving rise to a tendency to prolapsus. When the h^emorrhoid assumes a Globular form, it constitutes the ordinary bleeding pile. It may be situated on a broad base ; or, as not unfrequently happens, us point of attachment to the mucous membrane becomes elongated and It assumes a pedunculated shape, hanging downwards into the cavity of the rectum. It is of a dark-bluish colour, and numerous small vessels of a brighter hue than the body of the pile may be seen ramifying in the mucous membrane investing it. Its surface is at first smooth and shining, and may continue so throughout, bemg covered with a thin and delicate prolongation of the lining membrane of the gut. Not unfrequently, however, superficial ulceration takes place, and then it has a granulated strawberry-like appearance. _ Symptoms.—Internal piles are usually attended with a sensation of heat, Itching, pricking, or smarting about the anus, and a feeling as if there were a foreign body within the gut. After defaecation these sensations are increased, and are often accompanied by a bearing down sensation, as if the bowel were not emptied of its contents, that is peculiarly distressing and sickening. This is occasioned by the piles, or the relaxed mucous membrane, being protruded during the expulsion of the fseces, and not returning sufficiently quickly, being grasped by the sphincter ani and constricted by it. This feeling of discomfort and bearing down is much increased, if the patient stand or walk much after having had a stool, or if he be constipated. If this state of things be not properly attended to, the symptoms increase ; the bearing-down sensation amounts to true tenesmus, and the act of defecation becomes so painful that the patient defers it as long as possible, and then when it does take place, in consequence of the accumulation of the excreta and their hardness^

1 GENERAL RULES FOR ABDOMINAL OPERATIONS. 819 Parotitis is a somewhat frequent sequence of operations on the abdominal . peMc t"^^^^^^ a fact for which it is difficult to suggest any reasonable ■^^S^::^^is^r^^^^^^^^^ of death in operations upon the abdominal nscera. It probably arises chiefly from the injury done to the large sympa- :hetic plexuses in connexion with these parts, whilst the exposure ot the riscera to cold and the loss of blood doubtless aggravate it m many cases It cannot be doubted, however, that in some cases death is ascribed to shock when in reality it results from septic poisoning, for it ^^^^^.^^I^^^^vVpH pointed out the post-mortem evidences of peritonitis are often little maiKea, !and may be thought insufficient to have been the cause of death. Hemorrhage is necessarily a source of danger in many cases, but it presents nothing requiring special consideration. The following are the general rules appUcaile to all aMomiml operations .— ■ 1 The room in which the operation is to be performed must not be too cold, especially if the abdominal cavity is to be widely opened and the viscera ixposed. The most favourable temperature is 65° F. , u , 2 In those cases in which it is possible to do so, the bowels should be horoughly emptied by the use of purgatives for several days before, and an enema on the day of the operation. 3. In all operations on the lower half of the abdomen the bladder should be emptied by a catheter, and the pubes shaved. 4 The patient when placed upon the table should be warmly wrapped up, lest the shock be increased by chilling the body. The limbs and chest should be completely covered with sheets of cotton wool, loosely apphed with bandages. The area of the operation should be surrounded by warm carbolized towels. 5. The instruments and sponges, &c., and the hands of the Surgeon and ■ his assistants must be cleaned and disinfected with carbolic acid, as already described (Vol. I. p. 324). During the operation all sponges must be squeezed as dry as possible, lest a dangerous amount of the antiseptic be introduced into the peritoneal cavity. They should be washed in warm carbolic lotion to avoid chilling the parts. 6. The sponges and forceps should be counted by the Surgeon before and after any operation in which they are used inside the abdominal cavity. The nurse should be directed not to tear up any of the sponges during the operation. 7. All haemorrhage from the abdominal wall must be arrested before the peritoneum is opened. 8. If during the operation the intestines are exposed, they should be held on one side, and retained in the abdominal cavity by a large flat sponge. Should they be exposed externally, as in operations for hernia, intussusception, &c., or escape from the abdomen, they must be covered with a sheet of gauze several layers thick, wrung out of a warm 1 in 40 solution of carbolic acid. 9. When the operation is completed, if the abdominal cavity have been' opened sufficiently to admit the hand, it may be cleaned with sponges squeezed as dry as possible and passed into the most dependent parts of the cavity, one after another, until they return quite clean. If there is blood or pus in the cavity, or if fasces or urine have been extravasated, irrigation through a soft india-rubber tube is often necessary. A warm solution of boric acid (1 in 50) ' 3 G 2

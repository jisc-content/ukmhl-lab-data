GASTROSTOMY. 721 life prolonged, bj a frail tenure it is true, for many weeks. In such cases it is an interesting physiological fact that, although the patients may continue to be moderately well nourished, and do not feel the pangs of hunger, they suffer excessively from thirst. Operation of Gastrostomy.—The object of the operation is to expose tho stomach, and to make a fistulous opening in that part of it which is naturally in contact with the abdominal wall, and uncovered by the ribs. The ^ operation consists of three stages .—1. The exposure of the stomach ; 2. Its adhesion to the lips of the incision in the abdominal wall; 3. The making of an opening into it. The area to be exposed is not large, and corresponds externally to the cartilages of the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs ; above and internally it is bounded by the lower edge of the liver. In the contracted state of the stomach the pylorus lies immediately to the right of the middle Ime ; It IS advisable, therefore, to make the incision as far to the left as can conveniently be done. Labb6 recommends an incision about an inch and a quarter to an inch and a half in length, parallel to the left costal cartilages, and one inch from their borders, terminating below at an imaginary line drawn between the most prominent points of the convexities of the two ninth cartilages. This incision will be found to divide a few fibres of the external obhque and notch the edge of the rectus ; beneath this is the expansion from the internal obhque and the upper fibres of the transversalis, under which lie the transversalis fascia and the peritoneum. Howse, who has had great ex- perience m this operation, recommends a somewhat longer incision in the same direction commencing about one inch and a half from the middle line. When tne Sheath of the rectus is exposed he holds the wound widely open, and makes a ver ical incision in it a little way from its outer margin.

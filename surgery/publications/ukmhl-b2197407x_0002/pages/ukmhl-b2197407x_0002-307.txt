275 DIFFUSE SEPTIC OSTEOMYELITIS. veins of bone, lying as they do in rigid canals, cannot collapse, a condition highly favourable to the extension of thrombosis. The thrombi thus formed become impregnated with the products of the unhealthy process, disintegrate, and are washed on into the blood-stream, causing centres of suppuration wherever they lodge. It is this that makes septic osteomyelitis a most dangerous and often fiital disease. Fat-embolism has been observed in many cases of acute osteomyelitis, the liquid fat from the broken down marrow being forced into the vessels or lymphatics by the pressure of the inflammatory exudation. If the emboli arc impregnated with the products of decomposition, they may give rise to abscesses in distant parts where they lodge. If the patient escape the dangers of pysemia, the disease almost invariably leads to more or less extensive necrosis affecting chiefly the inner layer of the compact tissue. The long sequestra once so frequent in stumps, especially after amputation of the thigh, were the result of this process (see Yol. I., p. 77). After death, the appearances presented by the inflamed bone will, if it have been the seat of compound fracture, usually be most marked in the upper fragment; if it have been the seat of amputation or excision, they will extend through the whole of the bone that is left. The periosteum and outer surface of the bone will appear to be slightly injected. On making a longitudinal section of the bone, the medullary canal is found to be filled with pus or a reddish puriform fluid, often abominably offensive ; the medulla is swollen, soft, pulpy, of a deep red or reddish-brown colour ; the compact bone has a pinkish tinge, and the canceUous osseous structure is often of a bright rosy hue. In a case of compound fracture, the contrast between the deep coloration of the inflamed portion of bone and the naturally pallid appearance presented by that which is not diseased, and more particularly the deep red hue of the medulla in the one, and the pale yellowish waxy-looking tat mimg the medullary canal in the other, is most striking. Fayrer describes ttie medullary canal, in advanced stages of the disease, as being filled with a mass of dead blackened medulla, debris of bone, and pus. Symptoms.-In acute osteomyelitis, after an injury to or an operation mvolvmg the bone, the limb swells, and there is deep-seated severe aching pam with much tenderness. Abscesses form, often unconnected with the onginal wound, and profuse suppuration is established.

When symptoms of strangulation occur m a hernia which has long been irreducible, the failure to reduce it completely by taxis will often leave such doubt as to whether or not the strangulation is relieved that herniotomy will p-ove a much more certain method of treatment. Yigorous taxis is certainly contra-indicated when any doubt exists as to the true nature of Tn usingSgreat care should be employed, and no undue force should be had recourse to. It must be borne in mind that there are two obstacles to overcome—the resistance of the parts around the ring, and the bulk oi the tumour The first may be somewhat diminished by relaxmg the abdominal muscles, and consequently diminishing the tension of the tendmous apertures and fascifE of the groin. In order to effect this, the patient should be placed in a proper position, the body being bent forwards, and the thigli adducted, and semi-flexed upon the abdomen; the Surgeon may then, by employing steady pressure on the tumour, endeavour to squeeze out some of the flatus from the intestine, and thus to eflect its reduction. In doing this, the neck of the sac should be steadied with the fingers of the left hand: whilst, with the right hand spread over the tumour, the Surgeon endeavours to push it backwards, using a kind of kneading motion, and sometimes m the first instance drawing it slightly downwards, so as to disentangle it from the neck of the sac. The direction of the pressure is important; it should always be

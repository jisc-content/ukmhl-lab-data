TUMOURS OF THE TESTIS.^ , Simple TuMOURS.-Adenoma, or, as it has been called, Ci/stw Sarcoma, is the most common non-malignant tumour of the testicle. Structure.—The essential feature of this tumour is the presence of cysts, varying in size from a cavity just visible to one as large as a walnut. Between these cysts is a varying amount of solid tissue. The whole tumour lies within the distended tunica albuginea, but will be found to possess a delicate capsu e of its own, between which and the tunica albuginea is a dehcate layer of a pale yellowish-brown colour, composed of the tubular substance of the testicle spread out over the mass of the growth. The attachment of the tumour is towards the mediastinum testis, and this suggests that the growth springs from the region of the rete testis, the cysts being believed to be derived from the obstructed and dilated tubes of that part of the gland. Microscopic examination shows that the cysts are lined with an epithelium, sometimes small and cubical, sometimes flattened. The interstitial tissue is composed of young connective tissue in various degrees of development. This is the typical structure of adenoma testis, but various modifications are met with. In the first place, the proportion of cysts to stroma varies greatly. The contents of the cysts may be clear and thin, or mucous and tinted, or stained with blood. More rarely they are filled with an atheromatous pulp. Occasionally some of the smaller cysts are filled with laminated epithelium, forming pearl-like bodies.

Anal Abscess.—Besides the two forms of abscess just described as occurring in the ischio-rectal fossa, another is commonly met with to which the term anal abscess " may be applied. It commences in the submucous tissue of the gut immediately above the anus. Its cause is not always evident. It may arise from suppuration taking place beneath an inflamed pile, from wound of the mucous membrane by some solid body such as a fish-bone, or from the forma- tion of a caseating tuberculous nodule in the submucous tissue. The pus thus formed burrows downwards between the mucous and muscular coats of the bowel till it reaches the anus ; here it passes out beneath the skin and forms a small rounded swelling at the margin of the anus. If unrelieved it may burrow still further in the subcutaneous tissue. The pus in this case lies superficial to the sphincter. These abscesses may be acute or chronic ; when chronic they are frequently tuberculous, advancing slowly and containing thick curdy pus. They usually burst both internally and externally, and are the most common cause of the ordinary fistula in ano. By early opening and dressing with wet boric lint and frequent bathing with a concentrated solution of boric acid they can sometimes be got to heal without leaving a fistula. If they are tuberculous this seldom happens, and the best treatment is to lay them thoroughly open into the bowel, to scrape the surface well with a sharp spoon, and to dress them with iodoform ointment. Fistula in Ano.—The sinus left by the contraction of the cavity of an ischio-rectal or anal abscess constitutes n fistula in ano ; an affection that has

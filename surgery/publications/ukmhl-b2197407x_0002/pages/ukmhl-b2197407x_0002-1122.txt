The lodgment ol^ a fragment not \2, occasions great local irritation, ending perhaps in cystitis or abscess but may give rise to severe rigors and nervous prostration.

Most frequently, they may be puslied back into the bladder, by passing a large catheter carefully down to them. The most convenient instrument for this purpose is one that is open-ended, so Fig. 893.—Urethral Foroeps. that the fragment may be received in the aperture at the end of the instru- ment, and so pushed on before it. Through such a catheter as this a stream of water may be injected, and the fragment thus forced back. Should these manoeuvres fail, it has been proposed to crush the fragments in the urethra with a small lithotrite (Fig. 892) ; but this plan is somewhat hazardous, as it Fig. 894.—Urethral Forceps, with Alligator-jaw action. The smaller figure presents the Jaw of Forceps open. is very difficult to avoid pinching up the mucous membrane of the canal with the bits of stone. The safest practice seems to be, either to extract them through the urethral orifice, or to cut them out through the perineum. Extraction through the urethral orifice may be effected with forceps (Figs. 893, 894), or with Civiale's instrument (Fig. 318, Vol. I.). Should these means fail, or should the fragment be very deeply seated, as in the membranous portion of the urethra, and the local and constitutional irritation produced by

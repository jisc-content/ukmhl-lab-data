733 TUMOURS OF THE LARYNX. tissue, covered with a squamous epifcheliara. Myxoma, Lipoma and Ncevus have been met with ; Mt]xo-chondroma is of extreme rarity. A case has been recorded by J. W. Bond, in which partial excision of the larynx was performed for a large myxo-chondroma springing from the anterior surface of the posterior part of the cricoid cartilage. Gysls arising from retention of the secretion of the mucous glands occasionally develop in the neighbourhood of the epiglottis or false vocal cords. They form smooth, shining, rounded projections. Polypus of the Larynx is a term applied to any peduncalated growth, and has no pathological significance. The simple tumours of the larynx cause alteration in the voice, slight cough, discomfort, and dyspnoea, varying in degree with the size of the growth. Their true nature can be recognized only by carefal examination with the laryngoscope. Treatment.—These growths may be removed by one of two methods—the endo- or the ecto-laryngeal. There appears to be a general consensus of opinion amongst laryngologists that the endo-laryngeal method should always be attempted in the first instance. Slionld it fail, then the hirynx may be opened and the growth removed from without. The endo-laryngeal method consists in removing the growth by means of instruments specially designed for the purpose, guided by the laryngoscope. The instruments most com- monly used are forceps, by which the growth can be seized and torn from its attachments ; but in some cases, especially when the growth is of some size and distinctly pedunculated, wire snares or small ecraseurs maybe of use. In some cases the destruction of the growth may be brought about by simply cru-^hing it with a strong pair of forceps. These operations have been greatly faciHtated by the use of cocaine, but still require practice on the part both of the patient and the Surgeon. The patient must be taught to keep steady, to Fig. 759.—Endo-laryngeal Forceps.

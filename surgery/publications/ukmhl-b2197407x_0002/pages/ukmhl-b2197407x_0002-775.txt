I at once plunged the scalp 1 Lough the crico-thyroid membrane, and cut down through the cricoid caiti- age, to as to make a free aperture into the air-passage ^^-^^—jj^l set up artificial respiration, I found the air-passages clogged with mspissated mucus, which prevented the entrance of air into the 1™^^-^^^^^^^^ fellow-creature being at stake, and dependent on the immediate estabhshment of artificial respiration, I felt that there was only one thing- to be done-to empty the chest at once of the matters loading it. I accordingly applied my lips to the wound and sucked out three or four mouthfuls of blood and naucus, when I had the satisfaction to see that air could be made to enter the lungs After artificial respiration had been kept up for some time, the heart becran feebly to act, the face became less livid, and the circulation was re-"estabhshed ; the patient did well, and was in good health many years afterwards. Operations.—Tn opening the windpipe, the Surgeon has the choice ot two situations in which he may make the aperture: either in the crico-thyroid membrane by Laryngotomy, or in some part of the trachea by Tra- cheotomy. Besides these two established operations, some Surgeons have performed a third—Laryngo-tracheotomy, by opening the crico-thyroid membrane, and dividing the cricoid cartilage with the upper rings of the trachea. Whichever operation is performed, as soon as the windpipe is opened, the patient is seized with an attack of spasm and convulsive cough, often attended with much struggling and distress, during which the whistling occasioned by the passing of the air through the new opening is very marked. The patient, however, soon recovers, and breathes easily, the signs of asphyxia disappearing. In some cases the opposite condition is observed, the patient ceasing to breathe the moment the tube is inserted. This need cause no anxiety, as natural breathing speedily returns after a few movements of artificial respiration. The winrlpipe may require to be opened by laryngotomy or tracheotomy for many different conditions. In the adult larz/ngotomij m&j he required 1. In acute laryngitis with oedema of the glottis ; 2. In scald of the glottis by boiling water or acids ; 3. In sudden spasms of the glottis in cases of chronic laryngeal disease ; 4. In cases of extreme urgency from obstruction of air- passages by a foreign body; .5. If the-air-passage becomes obstructed by

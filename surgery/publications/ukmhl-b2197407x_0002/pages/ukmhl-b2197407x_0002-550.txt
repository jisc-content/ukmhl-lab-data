DEFORMITIES OF THE SPINE. CHAPTER LIU. —♦— DEFORMITIES. LATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE, SCOLIOSIS. Thb^ normal erect position of tlie spinal column, and the various curves which it presents, are maintained by the close manner in which its separate elements are knit together by ligamentous and muscular structures, and by the way in which, when thus bound together as a whole, it is supported on each side by the strong mass of the erector spinse and its prolongations. The abnormal curvatures of which the spine may be the seat are either lateral or antero-posterior in their direction, and the complicated character of the curves receives its explanation from the fact that when an antero-posterior or lateral deviation occurs in any situation, secondary deviations are produced Fig. 621.-Double Fig. (i22.—Qi.iidrnijle Fig. 623.— Fig. 624.— • Lateral Curve.

Lateral curvature, with which we are here chiefly concerned, is often spoken of as Scoliosis (Figs. 621 and 622). In some rare cases, however, inde- pendently of disease of the vertebrse, the lower portion of the cervical or the upper dorsal region projects backwards in an arched manner, constituting the condition termed Kyphosis (Fig. 623) ; and in other cases, of still less frequent occurrence, there may be incurvation of the spine in the dorso- luinbar region, giving rise to Lordosis (Fig. 624). Although lordosis is rare as a primary deviation of the spine, it is a frequent result of the tilting for-

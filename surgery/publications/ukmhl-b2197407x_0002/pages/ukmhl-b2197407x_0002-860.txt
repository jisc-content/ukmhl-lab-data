Eadical cure of a hernia'by trussVes-^^^^^^ effected only m those cases in which the abdominal aperture^Treen lef congenitally weak or open. Hence it can be hoped for only in children and very young adults, and only in those two congenital forms of hern" umbilical and the inguinal. The continued pressure of the truss ir7hese cases seems to determine the adhesive processes necessary for the closure of the aperture. After the cure is supposed to have been effected in this way the truss must be worn for a very considerable length of time, lest by any violent movement the rupture be forced down again. Of the various Operations which have been devised for the radical cure of hernia, the only one which is practised at the present day is the open method. ihis consists in exposing the sac by an incision, ligaturing the neck, and in many cases removing the body, of the sac, and finally closing the aperture through which the hernia has escaped with sutures. This method is very ancient, and was frequently applied to inguinal hernia in the middle ages either by surgeons or by traveUing quacks. It fell into disrepute, however owing to the mortahty that attended it until the introduction of the antiseptic method of treating wounds robbed it of the greater part of its dangers. In 1871 Lister reported two cases in which he had cut down upon a hernial sac and closed the opening with cat-gut sutures, but this method of operating was found to be uncertain in its results. Since then Annandale, Banks, Czerny, Macewen, Ball, and many others have introduced modifications and improve- ments which have rendered the operation both safe and effectual. Of the methods which have been entirely abandoned may be mentioned :— 1. That which aims at obliterating the neck of the sac by the introduction of caustics, by scarification, by puncture, or by injection of iodine ; 2. Plugging the hernial aperture by the invagination of the sac and the subcutaneous tissue into it; and 8. The subcutaneous introduction of wire, silk, or other liga- tures to invaginate the sac and subcutaneous areolar tissue and to close the ring. The ineffectual and dangerous character of the first of these methods is obvious, whilst the only advantage which the others at one time possessed was that they did not involve the dangers of an open Avound. Failure must occasionally occur after operations undertaken for the radical cure of hernia, as to accomplish this it would be necessary in some cases to

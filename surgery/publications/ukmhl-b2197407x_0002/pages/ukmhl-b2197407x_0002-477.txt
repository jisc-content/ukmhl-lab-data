TUBERCULOUS DISEASE OF KNEE. 445 a length as to extend from three to four inches beyond the foot. Two strips of strong strapping are prepared of sufficient length to reach from immediately below the head of the tibia to one inch beyond the sole of the foot; to one end of each of these a stout tape is firmly sewn. The strips are then applied to the sides of the leg, the tapes being below. To give additional security some narrower strips must be wound spirally round the leg, care being taken not to apply them circularly, or with sufficient tightness to constrict the limb. Over all, a flannel bandage m&y be applied from the ankle to the upper end of the tibia. The strips of plaster thus applied, if of proper quality, should retain their hold without shifting for many weeks. The limb is then passed through the upper ring of the splint, which is pushed upwards till it gets a Fig. 583.-Tlionias's Knee-Splint. Fig. 584.-Thonias's Knee-Splint applied. firm bearing against the tuberosity of the ischium. The splint is secured in position by tying the tapes atttached to the strips of plaster to the ring ac the bottom of the splint. It is not intended in so doing to extend the limb forcibly, but merely to retain the splint steadily in position. If the patient is to walk on the splint it is better to have a bar fixed between the two vertical rods, above their lower ends, to which the tapes can be made fast, otherwise thev are quickly worn through. The hmb being thus fixed longitudinally, lateral

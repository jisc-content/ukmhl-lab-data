DISEASE OF THE IIIV-JOINT. 428 of age ; four pounds between the ages of six and ten ; five or six pounds from ten to thirty. The period during which the weight extension should be applied has already been considered at p. 420. At the end of the time the Surgeon must decide what are the means best adapted for the maintenance of perfect rest in the joint, which will be required for at least a year. If the patient's surround- ings are such that he will not be deprived of fresh air by being kept in the recumbent position for some weeks at least, this is certainly the most efficient treatment. In adults a long splint may be applied as for fractured thigh. Fig. 570.—Thomas's Splint. Fig. 569.—Thomas's Splint applied. This is however, of little use in children, as they always manage by twisting the body to maintain a considerable degree of flexion with adduction or abduc- tion. Hamilton's double long splint (Fig. 218, Vol. L, p. G22) should there- fore be used, by which a much better position is obtained. Weight extension can be applied with this if required. . • , i Thomas's sphnt (Figs. 5GD, 570) is by far the best apparatus yet invented for the treatment of all Ibrms of hip disease. It may be applied at any stage, and should be worn till the cure is complete. It will, however generally be found most convenient, when there is considerable abduction or adduction witb acute pain in the early stages of the disease, to correct this by means of the

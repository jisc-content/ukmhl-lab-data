Omental Hernia is usually soft and doughy, retm-ning slowly on pressure into the abdomen, feeling irregular on the surface, and having an Ill-defined outhne. It occurs most frequently on the left side, and is rare in infants, in whom the omentum is short. In Entero-epiplocele there is a combination of the two conditions and their signs ; but these are usually so uncertain, that few Surgeons care to predict before opening the sac what the probable nature of the contents may be. Csecal Hernia usually occurs on the right side, but the csecum has been known to be present in a femoral or inguinal hernia of the left side. Treves has conclusively shown that the view which was at one time held that hernia of the c^cum is usually devoid of a sac is not true. A complete sac is in fact usually present, and this was so in all but two of fifteen cases collected by Treves. In the remaining two cases no sac was present, and a case of caecal hernia without a peritoneal covering has lately been recorded by W. H. Bennett. In such cases the peritoneum is supposed to be stripped fi-oin the bowel as the latter descends into the hernia. When the sac is partially or completely absent the hernia is irreducible. "When the hernia is large, and only partially invested by serous membrane, a sac usually exists at its upper aspect, into which a portion of small intestine may fall, and which may in some cases constitute a second hernia lying above or before the CEecal one, which will be found situated at the posterior wall when this hernial pouch is opened. Strangulated hernia of the csecum has several times been met with in infants. Hernia of the Bladder or Cystocele is very rare, and is usually par- tially or completely devoid of a peritoneal investment. South states that there is a preparation at St. Thomas's Hospital, in which the fundus of the bladder,

The period at which glandular implication occurs seems to bear no definite relation to the position or size of the primary tumour. The glands first affected are usually those in the lower and anterior part of the axilla, and some- times an indurated lymphatic vessel can be felt passing to them from the breast. In examining the axilla the patient's arm should be kept by the side, so that the axillary fascia may be relaxed. Some loss of flesh is usually the only constitutional symptom during the second stage of the disease, which has an average duration of six months. Third Ulceration of tlie skin usually begins as a small crack or fissure, surrounded by scaly epi- dermic desquamation, in the area which is already infiltrated by the tumour. A small exudation of serous fluid takes place, which dries into a scab, and under this, ulceration sets in, which speedily assumes the ordinary characters of a cancerous ulcer, having hard, elevated, and everted edges, a greyish-green surface, and discharging a quantity of very fetid pus. Whilst the disease is extending superficially it is also invading the deep parts, and becomes adherent to, and finally implicates, the pectoral muscle. This is evidenced by fixation of the breast when the muscle is brought into action. By its further spread the growth may invade the sternum and ribs, and even reach the pleura, causing pleural effusion. Meanwhile the glandular enlargement progresses, and the supraclavicular glands may become affected. (Edema of the upper lirnb and severe neuralgic pain shooting down it are often caused by the pressure of the enlarged glands on the axillary vein and nerves.

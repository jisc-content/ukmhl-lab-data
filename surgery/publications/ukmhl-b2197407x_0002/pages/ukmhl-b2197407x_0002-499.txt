OSTEOPLASTIC RESECTION OF FOOT. 467 by a transverse one across the back of the leg. This last incision is made down to the tibia just above the level of its articular surface. The ankle-joint is then opened from behind and disarticulated. The foot is now dorsally flexed aad the soft parts carefully separated from the bones until the mid-tarsal joint is reached and disarticulated. The astragalus, os calcis, and the soft parts of the heel are thus removed. The malleoli and the articu- lar surface of the tibia are then sawn off from behind forwards, and the surfaces of the scaphoid and cuboid similarly treated. The anterior part of the foot is left attached by the soft parts and tendons lying ia front of the ankle. Finally, the sawn surfaces of the scaphoid and cuboid are sutured to those of the tibia and fibula, thus bringing the remains of the foot into a line with the leg. MacOormac has recorded two cases in which he performed this operation with satisfactory results, in one for tuberculous disease of the os calcis and astragalus Fig. 598.—TuTDerculous Disease of Fig. 599.—Disease of Cuneiform the Scaphoid, spreading to other bones Bones, through the anterior tarsal synovial sac. and the soft parts over them, and in the other for extensive sloughing of the heel following an injury. After the operation the patient walks on the ends of the metatarsal bones with the toes bent forwards at a right angle. Excision of the Culjoid Bone, either in whole or in part, may be required. Partial excision is here done with the gouge. "When the whole of the bone is taken away, the fifth metatarsal bone also, with the little toe, will probably require removal. This may be done by making the flap, as depicted in Fig. 55, Vol. L, only commencing the incision about an inch further back, opposite the calcaneo-cuboid articulation, and opening this instead of the metatarso-cuboid. The Scaphoid Bone is very commonly the seat of primary disease ; and, H H 2

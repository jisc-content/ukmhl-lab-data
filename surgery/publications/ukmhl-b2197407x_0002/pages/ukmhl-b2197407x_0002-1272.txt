These simple means^how ever, will sometimes succeed in effecting a radical cure. Thus inTnfants t 1 will happen that the application of evaporating lotions 0 m M tut'e ' ' nritants may remove the effu«ed fluid ; and indeed it is seldom that any othe plan of treatment than this is required in young childi-en.

If there be a communication with the peritoneum, a truss should be applied over the inguinal canal. In adults it occasionally happens that simple tapping of the tumour has effected a cure. Many years ago a gentleman from Cuba consulted me for a small hydrocele which had been forming for several months ; I tapped it with a fine trochar, and drew off about five ounces of fluid. This was followed by a radical cure. This case bears out a remark made by Brodie, that the few instances in which he had known simple tapping to produce a radical cure occurred in West Indians. I have, however, several times seen hydroceles disappear after having been tapped a few times, without any other treatment, in persons who had never been in hot climates. This simple operation is not, however, altogether free from danger ; I have known an old man die from inflammatory oedema of the .scrotum after having been

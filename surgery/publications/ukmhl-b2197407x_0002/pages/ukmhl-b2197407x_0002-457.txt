TUBERCULOUS DISEASE OF HIP: PROGNOSIS. 425 Committee. The value of the statistics is enhanced by the fact that the patients at the Hip Hospital are kept under treatment or watched as out- patients as far as possible until the final result is known. Patients requii-ing operation are sent elsewhere, and consequently are placed in a separate class. WITH WITHOUT SUPPURATION. SUPPURATION. 52 31 38 24 C.

Of the 87 cases in which death took place after suppuration, 16 died of meningitis, 20 died of albuminuria and dropsy, 3 of albuminuria and phthisis, 5 of phthisis, 9 of exhaustion, 2 of erysipelas, 1 of pytemia, and 24 from unknown causes, 19 of which had been discharged as incurable. In the 13 non-suppuratiug cases which terminated fatally, death took place from the following causes : 7 from meningitis, 1 from phthisis, 1 from tuberculous pneumonia, 1 from croup, 1 from intercurrent disease (nature unknown), and 2 from unknown causes. In the cases with suppuration ending in cure the average duration of treat- ment was about 4 years, in the non-suppurating cases it was about 3. In the fatal suppurating cases the average duration of life was %\ years. Of 614 cases treated at the Hip Hospital in the years 1880 to 1889, Howard Marsh was able to obtain information of only 35 deaths, which gives a morta- lity as low as 6 per cent. The treatment of the suppurating cases consisted in antiseptic drainage of the abscesses. G-eneral tuberculosis is an occasional, but very rare, cause of death in cases of hip disease. Thus, of 130 cases treated consecutively in University College Hospital, death from this cause only occurred in 5 instances, whilst Howard Marsh finds that of all the suppurating cases treated at the Alexandra Hospital since 1879, only 5 per cent, have died from this cause. y*^^^*y °^ Limb.—In the most favourable cases of recovery from hip-joint disease a varying amount of lameness almost always remains. This may not be more than a scarcely perceptible limp, due to slight impairment of the mobility of the joint. In the majority of cases, however, the lameness IS much more evident, and is dependent upon a greater or lesser degree of ankylosis of the hip-joint and shortening of the limb, often with faulty position. In these cases it is interesting to observe how Nature compensates for the loss of all abduction and rotatory power in the hip by giving an extremely increased degree of mobility to the lumbar vertebra : so that the patient, in walkin-

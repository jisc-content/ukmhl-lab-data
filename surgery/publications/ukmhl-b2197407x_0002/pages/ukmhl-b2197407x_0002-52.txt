20 SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE SKIN. endonenriiim and atrophy of the fibres of the nerves leading to the affected spot. Savory and Buthn have also brought forward evidence to show that the sensory fibres are chiefly, if not solely, affected. Similar ulcerations are met with in some cases of locomotor ataxy, and more rarely in connexion with some peculiar cases of spina bifida (see Spina Bifida). It may therefore be concluded that the primary cause of the disease is impairment of nutrition consequent upon degenerative changes taking place either in the nerves lead- ing to the affected parts or in that portion of the sensory columns of the cord that is in communication with the foot.

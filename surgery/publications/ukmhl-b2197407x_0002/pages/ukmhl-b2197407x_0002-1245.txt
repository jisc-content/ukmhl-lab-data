TVUOVRS OF THE URETHRA. "'3 knife (Figs, 931 »d 982). Care should be ^rir^To! f eed from cicatricial tissue, and that the — Xntageous to wounded. When the fistula is near the cervix it may be advan incise the anterior lip or even to e«ise a «-edge-shaped P«*™; ^° ' f,,a ree ixcoess to the fistulous opening. After the edges have J'^<l'J ^ through the coiTesponding point on the opposite side without transfixing he veXal mucous membrane. Between the deep sutures superficial ones should b placed so as accurately to approximate the surfaces : it is best to tighten the superficial sutures first and then the deep ones. Whenever possible the edees of the fistula should be brought together transversely to the loug axis ot the va-ina. Trendelenburg and others have sutured vesico-vagmal fistul«i through a suprapubic opening into the bladder, but it is probable that this metho^d will only be required in very few and exceptional cases. After-treatment.—The vagina after the operation is washed out with 1 in 2000 perchloride lotion, and iodoform dusted in the wound. Iodoform gauze is then lightly packed into the vagina, to be removed together with the stitches about the eighth day. Sims's retention catheter (Fig. 934) maybe introduced into the bladder for the first 48 hours ; after this a catheter must be passed every four hours ; catheterization should be continued until two to three days after the stitches have been removed. The bowels should be kept closed for the first three days ; after this they may be opened with castor-oil and kept open every day with medicine if necessary. Fig. 934.—Sims's Catheter. TUMOURS OF THE URETHRA. Polypi of the male urethra are rare, if we exclude the small polypoid masses of granulation tissue which are sometimes detected with the endoscope in cases of chronic gleet (p. 115'.)). A small granular florid mass is sometimes met with just within the orifice of the canal. It should be snipped off with a fine pair of curved scissors.

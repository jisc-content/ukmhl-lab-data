SPECIAL ANEURISMS. 202 pressed as much as possible, and the head turned somewhat to the opposite side. The situation of the external jugular vein should then be ascertained if possible before commencing the incision. It may lie at any point between the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid and the edge of the trapezius; most commonly it is close to the former muscle, and occasionally it is wanting. The operation is commenced by drawing tlie integuments of the lower part of the neck downwards over the clavicle and making an incision about four inches in length upon the bone, dividing the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, and the supraclavicular branches of the cervical plexus. When the tension is Fig. 4S5.â€”Ligature of the Subclavian iu the Third Part of its Course. taken off the part, this incision will be found to traverse the base of the posterior triangle of the neck. The chief object of drawing the skin down- wards is to avoid any risk of wounding the external jugular vein, for as this vessel perforates the deep cervical fascia about one finger's breadth above the clavicle, it cannot be drawn downwards with the integmnents. Some- times the cephalic vein crosses the clavicle to join the external jugular, and it would then necessarily be divided in the first incision. The next step in the operation is to find the external jugular vein. In order to do this the deep cervical fascia must be carefully dissected through close to_ the clavicle ; immediately beneath the fascia a quantity of loose areolar tissue is exposed, in which the lower end of the vein will commonly be found. As soon as the deep cervical fascia is divided great caution must be used,

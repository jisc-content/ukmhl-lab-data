I024 DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. most frequent causes of death were peritonitis, septic poisoiiin{<, and suppreg. sion of urine. The mortality from tliese causes after abdominal uephrectomv was 13, !•;"), and 6-5 per cent, respectively ; and after lumbar iiephroctoiny ]•!, t'O, and -I'O respectively. Knowsley Thornton has performed nephrectomy 49 times; in all but one the kidney was removed through an abdominal incision, and in the large inajoritv this was made at the outer border of the rectus. The total number of deaths was 10, but if two of these, which occurred from causes not directly connected with the operation, be subtracted, we have -17 cases with 8 deaths, or a mortality of 17 per cent. Of 23 cases of nephrectomy reported by Henry Morris in ]8'.)3, 7 died. Of 5 cases of solid tumour 2 died within twenty-four hours of the operation; Langenbuch's method was adopted in 3 cases and the lumbar in 2. Of i; cases of hydronephrosis all recovered from the operation ; 1 died a month later of uraemia, and the post-mortem examination revealed advanced hydro- nephrosis of the opposite kidney. Of 7 cases of calculous disease, 2 died; one death occurred four days after the operation as the result of disorganiza- tion of the other kidney by calculous pyelitis and tuberculous disease of the lungs ; in the other case, in which a stone was impacted in the ureter, the cause of death was not explained. Of 5 cases of tuberculous disease, 3 died from defective secretion of the other kidney. Morris has since abandoned nephrectomy in the treatment of tuberculous disease unless the kidney be found absolutely destroyed. If we leave out of consideration the 5 tubercu- lous cases we have a total of 18 with 4 deaths ; but if the case in which the other kidney was disorganized and the lungs tuberculous be also omitted there remain 17 cases with 3 deaths, or a mortality of 17*3 per cent.

Those in which the operation is of doubtful expediency, h J'f ^^^^ favourable for Operation—Those cases of carcinoma of the bieast are most favourable for operation in which the disease is recognized in I S early stage when it is apparently limited to the mamma, unconnected with or deep structures, and not associated with glandular infection • and m which the patient is middle-aged, not too fat, and free from any constitu- tional condition which renders operations of any kind inadvisable. The small nodular scirrhus, and the atrophying and colloid varieties, are more hopeful than the inftltrating scirrhus or the encephaloid variety. 2. Cases unfit for Operation.—This class includes cases presenting the following conditions: a. Strongly marked constitutional cachexia: b. becondary deposits in internal organs ; c. Enlargement of the glands above the clavicle . d. (Edema of the hand and arm from pressure on the axillary vein ; e. Adhesion of the tumour to the ribs and intercostal muscles ; /. \\ idespread infiltration of skin ; ff. An extensively ulcerated and fungating tumour, with marked constitutional cachexia.

VOL. II. DIVISION FOUKTH DISEASES OF TISSUES. CHAPTEK XXXVII. SUEGICAL DISEASES OF THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. The various aflFections peculiar to the skin, such as eczema, scabies, impetigo, acne, lepra, psoriasis, &c., fall within the province of the Surgeon, and are commonly treated by him in practice ; but, as the consideration of these would necessarily lead into the whole subject of Dermatology, the limits of this work would not allow me to discuss so extensive and special a branch of Surgery.

Similarly the nails may become brittle and fissured in connexion with squamous syphilides as the result of the matrix becomino- inflamed. Atrophy of the Nails may occur as the result of any condition, local or

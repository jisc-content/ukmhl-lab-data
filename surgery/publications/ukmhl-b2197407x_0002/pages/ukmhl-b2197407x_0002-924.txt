Ever since the accident, he liad suffered much from dyspeptic symptoms and constipation, though previously he had mission the difficulty in breathing increased ; and four days before he came 0 the hospital violent pain in the abdomen came on, and his bowels ceased to act, although he took a variety of aperient medicines, and had enemata contammg croton oil. On admission, the abdomen was tensely distended and tympanitic, with pain around the umbilicus ; the tongue was coated with whitish-brown, moist fur ; the pulse was small, quick, and somewhat resisting • there was nausea, but no vomiting. The skin was cool, and the countenance anxious ; the bowels had not acted for seven days, but he had frequent desire to go to stool. He was ordered an aperient draught every third hour As this had no effect, he was directed to take calomel and elaterium piUs, and to have turpentine enemata, which afforded him some relief, though they brouffhb away no f^ces. The patient became more restless, the skin cold and flabby, the countenance more anxious, the breathing shorter, and the abdomen more tympanitic, and he died two days after admission, and nine from the com- mencement of the obstruction. _ Examination of the Body tiventy-four hows after death.—The abdomen was distended and tympanitic, and the peritoneum contained about six ounces of fluid, with here and there patches of recent lymph. The small intestines were not distended : the large were greatly distended with flatus, the cfficum extending into the cavity of the pelvis ; the ascending and the transveree colon were much distended, and it was found that a large loop of the trans- verse and of the descending colon had passed through an opening in the tendon of the diaphragm into the pleural sac, and was there strangulated (Fig. 812). The colon below the stricture was contracted, and entirely empty. On opening the thorax, the loop of intestine, fourteen inches in length, of a pale slate-colour, and distended with gas, was found in the left pleural sac. It reached as high as the fifth rib, touched the pericardium, and was overlapped by the free margin of the left lung. Where strangulated, it was of a darker colour than elsewhere. The opening in the diaphra,£rin, through which it liad passed, admitted little more than the point of the fore- finger, and had a thin tendinous margin. The tenth and eleventh ribs, on the left side, were found to have been fractured ; the latter was united by bone, but the tenth rib, at the seat of fracture, had formed a false joint.

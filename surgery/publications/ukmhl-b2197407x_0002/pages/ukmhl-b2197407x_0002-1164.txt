The tumour was then torn away by the finger, and the pedicle cut across with a knife guarded by the finger. The patient did well. Humphry in 1877 operated on a boy who had a tumour in the bladder causing dysuria and hemorrhage Me opened the bladder by lateral cystotomy through the perinseum, and removed the tumour with forceps and the finger-nail. It proved to be a hbro-sarcoma. The patient made a good recovery. Volkmann and Marcacci both performed suprapubic cystotomy for the removal of vesical myomata but with fatal results. In 1881 Eansohoff of Ohio removed a tumour as large as a small peach growing from the posterior wall of the bladder. The operation he practised was lateral cystotomy ; the tumour was then scraped away by means of one of Volkmanu's sharp spoons. The patient recovered after a tedious convalescence. To Thompson is due the merit of having placed the operation on a more definite basis. His earlier operations were all performed through the permjBal incision, described at p. 1119. The finger was introduced into the bladder through the opening in the membranous urethra, and the position of the tumour ascertained ; it was then crushed or torn away from the mucous membrane by means of specially-constructed forceps. Increasing experience showed that this method was only adapted to simple pedunculated growths of very moderate size. For large growths, therefore, Thompson found it necessary to proceed to suprapubic cystotomy, pushing up the bladder with a large sound passed through the perineal wound. More recently, however, Thompson has practised suprapubic cystotomy both for exploration and removal of the growth. Even for small pedunculated growths this operation is probably safer, especially for those Surgeons whose experience is limited, as in it the forceps can be guided by sight and touch, whereas, by the perinseal method, it is more or less a scratch in the dark. Among others who have especially advocated the high operation are S. Jones. Bennett May, and Hurry Fenwick in this country, and Von Bergmaun, (xuyon, Dittel, and others on the Continent. Operation.—The bladder is opened in the same way as in the high operation for stone (p. 1043). Each side of the incision in the bladder must be held well up by a stitch passed through the coats. The cavity must then be gently cleaned, either with a small piece of sponge, or by running a stream of boric lotion through it. Great gentleness must be used in doing this, as if

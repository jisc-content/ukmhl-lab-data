The only exception to this ule IS when the case is urgent, and the bleeding does not proceed from any ecognizable vessel, but is rather a uniform venous oozing due to the obstruc- tion to the circulation through the lungs. In such cases the bleeding will continue as long as the obstruction remains unrelieved. But as the respiratory process is re-established, the venous turgescence of the neck subsides, and the iiffimorrhage proportionately lessens. This I have repeatedly found in asphyxia artihcially induced in animals ; and I have often seen it in the human subject, in cases m which it has become necessary to open the windpipe at once, with- out waiting to arrest hEemorrhage. It is impojtant to bear in mind that the risk of hemorrhage is not entirelv avoided by the use of blunt instruments. The veins are very thin-walled and easily torn, and I have seen very troublesome bleeding caused in this way by the incautious use of a director. The difficulties arising from hEemorrhage ai'e very greatly increased by an insufficient incision. There is seldom any trouble m arresting the bleeding if the wounded vessel can be clearly seen. Spencer Wells's forcipressure forceps will be found invaluable under these circumstances, as the vessel can be seized and the forceps left attached till the operation is completed. Should blood accidentally enter the trachea in such quantities as to threaten suffbcation, it must be sucked out either by the mouth applied to the tube or by an aspirator tube passed down the trachea. As in diphtheria it is extremely dangerous for the operator to suck the tube, it is advisable, when performing tracheotomy, always to have an aspirator at hand in case of need. R. W. Parker has invented a simple apparatus by which suction can be performed without danger. It consists simply of a tube to pass down the trachea, and another with a glass mouth-piece, connected by an oval glass bulb, which is plugged with carbolized cotton-wool, which thoroughly tilters any air passing through it. 3. Another difficulty in tracheotomy sometimes attends the process of Opening the Trachea after it is exposed. In consequence of the convulsive breathing of the patient, the sterno-mastoids are put upon the stretch, thus increasing considerably the depth of the wound in the neck ; and, at each short and gasping respiration, the air-tube is rapidly jerked up and down, approaching to and receding from the surface in such a way that the scalpel cannot be thrust into it with safety. This difficulty is best avoided by

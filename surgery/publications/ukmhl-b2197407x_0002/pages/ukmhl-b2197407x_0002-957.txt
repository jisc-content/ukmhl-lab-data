925 INTESTINAL ANASTOMOSIS. assistaut. A longitudinal incision about an inch and a half in length is now made into each piece of bowel opposite the attached border. A plate is slipped into each and is turned so that its longer axis corresponds with that of the bowel. The end sutures attached to each plate pass out through the ends of the incisions in the bowel; the lateral ones, threaded on needles, are passed through the wall of the bowel opposite the middle of the incision (Fig. 818). When the corresponding sutures are firmly tied the plates are drawn together, and bring two large peritoneal surfaces into contact with a free opening in the centre of each between the two segments of bowel. Before tying the silk threads a few fine sutures are inserted in the peritoneum along the posterior borders of the plates (Fig. 818), and after the approximation is complete a continuous stitch may be placed in a corresponding position in front. Union rapidly occurs between the peritoneal surfaces and the bone plates are absorbed. A considerable number of successful operations have been performed by Senn's method and the various modifications of it which have been introduced, and intestinal anastomosis must be regarded as a definitely established line of treatment in suitable cases.

HERNIA OF 'THE OVARY. 1297 may lead the Surgeon to imagine that the case is one of strangulated ^''slmno-ulation of a hernia containing only the ovary is of rare occurrenc;e^ The condition has already been mentioned at page 838 where it was pomt.d oat that the dingnosis may be difficult on account of die characteristic constitutional symptoms of strangulation Thus, f hough the e may be nausea, there is usually no actual vomiting, and althoiig-h constipation is probably present, there is no real obstruction. Enghsch showed that of 20 cases in which symptoms of strangulation were present a correct diagnosis was made in 7 only. Abscess or sloughing of the displaced ovary occasionally occurs. , . „ . ., n^iir^nm In a case recently nnder the care of Bilton Pollard m University College Hospital, the end of the Fallopian tube was strangulated in a femoral hernia. M'he patient was thirty-seven years of age, and a swelling had been accidentally discovered in the left groin four days before her admission. On the following day the swelhng became painful; the bowels continued to act; there was slight nausea, but no actual vomiting. The hernia was tense, rounded, and as large as a walnut. The sac contained clear fluid, and the ewolleu fimbriated extremity of the FaUopian tube, which was tightly mpped at the neck of the sac. The constriction was divided, and the tube returned into the abdomen. Treatment—^0 long as the hernia presents no special symptoms there is little or no occasion for interference, beyond the wearing of a properly fitted truss. If inflammation occur, the case must be treated on ordinary principles ; and if the ovary suppurate, the abscess should be opened. When the ovary is very painful, or has become cystic, extirpation may be practised. If symptoms of acute strangulation occur, herniotomy must be performed, and as a rule removal of the ovary will be found necessary. VOL. H. 4 O

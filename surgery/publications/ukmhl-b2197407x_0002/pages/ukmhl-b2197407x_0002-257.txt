LIGATURE OF EXTERNAL ILIAC. 225 In 23 cases the arfceiy was ligatured after pressure had failed, and in tAvelve of these Walsliam is of opinion that the previous compression had ren- dered the conditions of the operation materially worse. These statistics show that in well selected cases compression holds out a fair prospect of curing the disease and should be tried before resorting to ligature, but care must be taken not to damage the vessel or the parts covering it by too prolonged or forcible efforts. Should it fail, it becomes necessary to tie .the vessel leading to the sac. In the majority of instances the tumour, though it may have encroached on the abdomen, will not have reached too high for the external iliac to be ligatured ; should it have done so, however, the Surgeon may have to tie the common iliac artery ; but in some instances even this may not be Pig. 496.—Ligature of the External Hiac by Abenietliy's Operation, modified. practicable, and his choice must lie between the slender chance offered by constitutional treatment, and the fearful alternative of ligaturing the aorta. Ligature of the External Iliac Artery.—There are two modes of tying the external ihac artery without opening the peritoneum—the one originally practised by Abemethy, considerably modified by Listen ; and the other introduced by Astley Cooper. Abernethi/s modified method (Fig. 496) on the right side consists in com- mencing an incision at a point about one inch above and the same distance mternal to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, carrying it in a curved direction, with the convexity outwards, to a point about three-quarters of an mch above and half-an-inch external to the middle of Poupart's ligament When the operation is on the left side the incision should be commenced below VOL. n.

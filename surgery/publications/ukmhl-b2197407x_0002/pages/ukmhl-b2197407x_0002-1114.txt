ro82 URINARY CALCULUS AND LITHOTRITY. turning the stopcock connected with the catheter and fixing the india-rubb.r tube shown .nF.g. 884 to the cock at the apex of the bottle, the cont may be expelled and fresh water drawn in without disconnecting the bott om the catheter. I have to thank Professor Bigelow for furnishing me with the accompanying woodcuts, which represent the latest instruments used by Fig. SS6.—Sir H. Tlioinp.son's Improved Evacuator. himself. Modifications of Bigelow's evacuator suggested by Thompson and Otis are shown in Figs. 886 and 887. Preparation of the Patient.—Before proceeding to the operation of lithotrity, it is necessary that the patient's constitution should be carefully attended to ; the bowels should be freely opened, and the condition of the digestive organs regulated, and, more especially, all local irritability about the urinary organs should be subdued by ordinary medical treatment. This is even of greater im- portance than in lithotomy, as the pro- longed mechanical disturbance to which the bladder is exposed may aggravate any existing cystitis. The urine should be carefully examined, and the condition of the kidneys ascertained as far as possible. In a subsequent part of this Chapter, when we come to the comparison of lithotomy and lithotrity, we shall examine the condi- tions which either indicate or negative the performance of the latter operation. At present, we will suppose a case in which the Surgeon may have recourse to Htho- trityjwith every prospect of readily and permanently ridding the patient of his calculus. Use of Anaesthetics.—In former times many Surgeons habitually per- formed the operation without an anjesthetic, believing that the sensations of the patient were a useful guide to the Surgeon, helping him to avoid nipping or otherwise injuring the bladder. For the success of the present method of Fig. 887.—Otis's Evacuator.

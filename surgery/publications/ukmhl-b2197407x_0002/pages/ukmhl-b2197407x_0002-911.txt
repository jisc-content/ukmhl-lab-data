They consist of a tolerably frm and tense tumour, of a rounded shape, situated m the grom to heT^^^^^^^ side of the femoral vessels, and to the outer side of the spine of the pui s having its neck under Poupart's ligament, though, as it increases m , Tze L base is turned above that structure ; sometimes though rarely, it passes downwards upon the thigh. Its size varies considerably : most commonly it s not larger than a wahiut or a pigeon's egg, and then is deeply seated m the angle between the body of the pubes and the femoral vessels ; but occasionally it may attain a considerable bulk, as large as the fist or a French roll. When larse this hernia rises up above Poupart's hgament, and extends outwards parallel to it, so that it assumes an elongated shape; it is then usually some- what doughy and soft, even when strangulated-very different from the excessively tense feel that it has when small. In some rare cases the femoral hernia has been found lymg external to the vessels the mouth of the sac being between them and the ihac spine. In these circumstances strangulation cannot well occur, inasmuch as the mouth will be the widest part of the sac ; but, as Hesselbach has observed, if the fascia ihaca be torn by the pressure of the tumour, the rupture may be strangled in the aperture thus formed. Should an operation ever be required m such circumstances, it must be borne in mind that the circumflex ihac artery may be in some danger. . As a femoral hernia passes out through the crural ring, it comes into very close relation to the femoral vein, being separated from the vessel merely by the septum which divides the inner from the middle compartment of the femoral sheath. Were it not for this septum, as Roser has observed, the femoral vein would be compressed by the tense hernial tumour protruded between it and Gimbernat's ligament, and the inevitable consequence would be oedema of the whole lower extremity. As the hernia pushes down in the track of the crural canal, it can make no impression on the inner or on the posterior wall of the canal—both of which are unyielding ; but, pushing the anterior wall upwards, it drags upon the septum on the outer side of the neck of the sac, renders this tense, and thus saves the femoral vein from compression. The Diagnosis of femoral hernia is not always easy. When the hernia is large, and more particnlarly when it rises up above Poupart's ligament, it may at first be mistaken for an inguinal rupture. The diagnosis, however, may

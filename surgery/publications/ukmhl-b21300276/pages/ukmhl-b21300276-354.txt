32G veins, and the median nerve, which is situated over the artery, and contained in the same sheath as the vessels. From being directly over the artery, it re- ceives a pulsatory motion from it, and on this account the nerve has been mistaken for the artery, and tied. In the operation of securing this vessel, the edge of the biceps muscle is to guide us to its seat; an incision about two and a half or three inches in length, is to be made through the skin, and fascia, and tlie margin of the biceps drawn to the outer side. The sheath of the vessels is to be opened, the artery separated from the other contents, and a ligature applied. The cir- culation is afterwards continued by the communica- tions which exist between the branches of the superior deep humeral, and the recurrent branch of tlie radial artery; between the inferior deep humeral, and recur- rent ulnar, and iuterosseal branches; besides which there are other muscular, and collateral routes. The bend of the arm is a very important piece of anatomy, and ought to be well studied. It is com- posed of common integument, superficial or cutaneous veins, cutaneous nerves, fascia, the insertion of the biceps, brachial artery, bracliial vein, or veins, median nerve, and lastly, the tendon of the brachialis internus muscle. In reflecting the skin, the student should take care not to injure the superficial veins, and the cutaneous filaments of nerves. The veins are usually four in number, viz.â€”the cephalic, basilic, median cephalic, and median basilic; these two last are

The muscles, which are the active organs of loco-motion, are subordinate to it. The stomach cannot digest; the heart cannot beat; and the secreting organs cannot separate their fluids from the blood without it; indeed, it has the supreme dominion over all the functions of animal life, and its existence is the most striking distinguishing character between animal and vege- table substances.

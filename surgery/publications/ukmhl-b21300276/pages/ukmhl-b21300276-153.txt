129 Under the sclerotic, we find a black coat, which is uamed the tunica clioroides. It is seen to com- mence at the optic nerve, and to end at the Hga- meutum ciliare, which, with true deference to Dr. Knox, seems to me to be nothing more than compact cellulai- tissue. The choroid tunic Avas supposed by Ruysch to consist of two laminae; but modern minute Anatomists have exposed this mistake, by discovering that the laminated appearance arises from a dilFerence in the direction of the external and internal vessels o^ this membrane; those which are situated externally, run vorticosely; but those internally, have a disposition parallel to each other. The tunica choroides is a secreting membrane; its secretion is a black fluid, named, pigmentima nigrum, which absorbs the super- fluous rays of light. In the race of men, called. Albinos, this pigment is wanting; and so it is in the owl, and some animals; in which cases the eyes appear red, in consequence of the blood-vessels being visible; and such men and animals can see better in a weak, than in a sti'ong light. To the ligamentum ciliare is attached the iris, which floats in the aqueous humour, and divides the eye into two chambers; the anterior chamber is bounded by the cornea before, and the iris behind; the posterior chamber has the iris on the fore part, and the ciystalline lens posteriorly. The anterior surface of this curtain-like membrane, is of different colours, in different individuals; and sometimes

3 may hold to the medical profession may not be more immediate, than it does lo other pursuits in life.— Every kind of information in literature, science, and the arts, may be turned to a valuable purpose; for inde- pendently of other advantages which are sure to accrue from miscellaneous studies, they serve to enlarge the scope of the mind, and to destroy that pedantiy, still- ness, and repulsive gravity, which are too often asso- ciated with the medical character. Oiu' profession has its real dignity, and the power to command respect; but it has no claim to those qualities unless the mem- bers of it have such acquirements as will enable them to perform all the duties of their important calling. " Dignity in physic," as Dr. Gregory properly ob- serves, " is not to be supported by a narrow and selfish spirit^by self-importance—by a formality in di-ess and manners—or "by an affectation of mystery;—but by the superior learning and abilities of those who practice it, •—by the liberal manner of gentlemen, and by that openness and candour which disdain all artifice, which invite a free inquii-y, and thus boldly bid defiance to all that illiberal ridicule and abuse, to which medicine has been so much and so long exposed." When a determination has been made as to the nature of the youth's pursuit, the parent should recommend that plan of education to be adopted, which is best fitted for the attainment of the objects of that pursuit; so that his son may cultivate an early acquaintance with those branches of knowledge, the most essential to the sphere of life in which he is intended to move.

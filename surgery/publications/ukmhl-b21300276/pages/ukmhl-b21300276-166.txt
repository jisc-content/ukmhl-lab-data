142 covered with a valve; but this is not generally admitted. Although an aperture is not natural, an unentire state is not incompatible with the function ol" the membrana tympani; provided there be sufficient of it left to retain the chain of bones in their situa- tion ; but if these be displaced, deafness follows â€¢ because the vibration cannot be continued. Behind the membrana tympani is a cavity, called, the drum of the ear; across which, from the posterior surface of the membrane just mentioned to the mem- brane of the fenestra ovalis, is extended a chain of small bones, named, malleus, incus, os orbiculaie, and stapes; with these, small muscles are connected, by whose action the bones are moved, and the mem- branes, With which they are in contact, rendered tense, or lax. M. Majendie considers these muscles as the instruments which tighten and relax the membrana tympani; but in a Paper, published in the " Journal de Physiologic Experimentale,^'' on this subject, he shows, that muscular contraction may be replaced by elasticity. He found, on examining the organization of the ear, fiom the monkey downwards, that the muscles disappear, and are substituted by iiregular spherical bodies, of which one is comparatively hirge, belonging to the malleus, and the other much smaller, connected with the stajjes. These bodies, Majendie has denominated, from their properties, " corps elas- tiques;" they are considered as acting by elasticity, in keeping the membrane of the tympanum, and that of the fenestra ovalis, in a state of tension.

•2oa den, Sharpe, Walker, Chevalier, ami the opinion of some Medical Men, that the disease is constitutional, and therefore, that the removal of the enlarged gland is doing nothing, Mr. Grainger states the method of operating which he has adopted, and used in a great number of cases with invariable success. The instru- ment which he employs, is a double silver tube, about three or four inches long, according to the age of the patient from whose throat the tonsil is to be removed; through this, a well annealed silver wire is to be di*awn ^^o as to leave a noose at one end, of such a size as to enable the Surgeon to pass it easily over the enlarged tonsil; and the wire is to be tightened daily, until the tumour falls off by strangulation. But it would appear by note D, in the Appendix to Mr. Pattison's Edition of Burns' Work, that there is no necessity for allowing the wire to remain about the neck of the tumour, until the period of separation; and this is certainly true, as a few hours must be sufficient to destroy its life. Mr. Pattison mentions Dr. Physick's plan of removing the tonsil, which is the same as Mr. Grainger's, with two exceptions, viz.—his using soft pure iron wii'e instead of silver, and removing the instrument twenty-four hours after its application. The mode of disengaging the wire is simple, nothing more being necessary than to push a portion of it back througli the canula, until the noose is so much enlarged as to slip over the tonsil.

337 by a partial obliteration of the passage of communica- tion between the abdomen and the scrotum ; thus, the obliteration may not commence at the internal ring, but in the inguinal canal, leaving a pouch, into which, intestine, or epiploon, may easily insinuate itself; this pouch is gradually elongated, and in such a hernia, we find another sac, mider the tunica vaginalis reflexa. The late Mr. Hey, of Leeds, to whom the Profession is as much indebted as to almost any man, was the first, I believe, who described this variety of hernia; it is not, however, of very frequent occurrence. We will now give the Anatomy of the parts con- cerned in femoral, or crui*al hernia, some of which are the same as those of the inguinal species. This hernia takes the course of the vessels of the thigh; therefore, the fascia superficialis and Poupart's liga- ment are equally concerned in both inguinal, and crural hernia. Femoral hernia is a disease which more fre- quently happens in the female, than in the male sex; because the ligament of Poupart is more extended, owing to the greater breadth of the pelvis. The Ana- tomy of the parts therefore is better shown in the former, than in the latter. Before he proceeds farther with the dissection, than he has already done, in showing the Anatomy of inguinal hernia ; the student should observe the man-

ii9 Having given a brief description of the structures of the joints in general, it is easy to understand some of tlie pathological circumstances attendant on them. With the exception of the synovial membrane, all the parts are little vascular, and little sensible; hence joints are slow in taking on morbid action, and as in bone, that action, when once begun, is with difficulty subdued. This will teach us too, why a wound, which communicates with the cavity of a moveable articu- lation, is much to be dreaded; for a small puncture exposes to disease a very extensive surface, and the organisation and function of a joint are such as to interfere much with the curative process. The effects of a woimd, whether punctured or incised, are, first, an escape of synovial fluid; and secondly, the exposure of the whole cavity of the joint. When called to a patient suffering under an accident of this kind, the indications of treatment must be founded on the effects produced; our object must be to close the wound, and so effectually too, as to prevent the oozing of synovia. We wish to promote adhesion of its sides, and this cannot be done, unless the synovial secretion is con- fined within the cavity of the joint; great attention and care in diessing the wound, are the means best adapted to do this; but with all the attention that can possibly be bestowed, our attempts are often firustrated. If adhesion cannot be effected at first, it cannot be effected afterwards; for there succeeds to the adhesive inflammation a suppurative one, and granulation must be the process of cure; for there are only two modes

187 Stenonis) across the body of the masseter muscle, a situation where it is much exposed to iujuiy. A wound in the face may give rise to a sore which camiot be made to heal, if the ductus Stenonis be wounded; as there will be a continual discharge of * saliva; and this disease will last for life, without some aid from surgery. It does not follow as a matter of coui'se, that a salivary fistula should succeed to an external wound of the duct, if the injm-y be, in the first place, properly treated; but if we allow the period to pass, when there is a chance of promoting an adhesion between the edges of the wound, the evil we have spoken of may be anticipated. When called to a person who has just received a cut in the face, by which the duct has been divided, the woimd must be cleaned from coagula, and foreign substances; the edges approximated, and retained by means of a twisted sutui'e, and adhesive plaster; and further pressed on, and secured, by a linen compress, and roller. Pressure is absolutely necessary to prevent the oozing of the salivary secretion; without it, our aim would assuredly be fi'ustrated. If, in spite of this careful treatment, a salivary fistula should form, something else must be done. We have said, that the external elFusion of saliva is the cause of the mischief which ensues, if adhesion be not accomplished; hence, reason suggests, that if we can divert the course of that fluid into the mouth, instead of allowing it to be discharged outwardly, the wound will as soon cica- trize, as in any other part of the body, and the disease

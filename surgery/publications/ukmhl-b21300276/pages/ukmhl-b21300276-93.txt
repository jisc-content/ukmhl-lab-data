69 The Lungs, (an essential appendage to the cir- ciiJating system,) are situated in the thorax, one on each side the heart; the left lung is composed of two lobes; the right, of three; and the inclination of the heart to the left side, is the reason assigned for the difterence in the number of lobes. The structures which enter into the composition of these organs are, the bronchiae, or ramifications of the trachea; air cells of gi'eat minuteness; two sets of ai'teries, the pulmo- nionary luid broncliial; two sets of veins, correspond- ing with the arteries; absorbents; and nerves; thesfe ditferent parts are united together by a fiiie reticular texture; and the Avhole is suri'ounded by the pleu- ritic membrane. The Imigs are quite free in the thorax, except aft the lower, and posterior parts; where they are con- fined, in some measure, by the pleura; and their figure is conical; like the cavity in which they are contained. By forcible inflation, we can distend these organs to a very great extent; but this will give us no just con- ception of their state in natural inspiration; and they are never completely collapsed; for it is impossible to deprive them of all the aii- which they contain. The lungs perform the important function of respiration; the effects of vvhich are, a change of colour in the blood, and the production of animal heat. They are, too, accessary to the formation of the voice; and coughing, sneezing, sighing, yawn-

65 The arteries, and veins, are subject to inflam- mation, obliteration, ulceration, suppuration, mor- tification, and to the deposition of calcareous matter in theii" coats. The heart is the principal agent in the'circulation of the blood; its muscular structme giving it a power superior to that of any other agent. Its actions are two, viz.â€”a diastole, or dilatation; and asystole, or couti-action. The right auricle derives its blood from the veins, and contracts upon it; and whilst this am-icle is receiving blood from the general system, the left auricle is deriving blood from the lungs; thus, the actions of the auricles are synchronous, they dilate, and conti'act at the same moment of time, and the veutiicles do the same. The arteries contribute a share of power to the systemic circulation, for if they did not, the blood could not arrive at its ultimate des- tination ; the vis a tergo influence not being sufficient to accomplish it. Some Physiologists, however, deny that these vessels are endowed with any other power than that of elasticity; and they say, that this is the only auxiliary agent which they lend to the cii'culation of the blood. Berzelius is of this opinion, and many modems believe it to be true; but I would, in ad- dition to the evidences of the inherent action of vessels affbrded by local inflammation, and the phenomena of blushing, mention the variety of circulation observed in cold blooded animals. In fishes, the heart, as in the frog, consists of a single auricle

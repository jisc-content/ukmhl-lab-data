201 nose, it being a secretion from tbe membrane itself. It is ti-ue that on looking up the nostrils of a basis cranii, which has been macerated and dried, we observe light through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone; but it is to be remembered, that in the living subject, these small apertures are filled with fibrils of the olfactory nen e, and that .the pituitary membrane is in direct contact with the inferior, and the dura mater, with the upper surface of the cribriform plate. The impression, however, of .any volatile, or acrid essence, can easily be transmitted from the nose to the brain ; it being by fai* the most direct passage. This fact exposes the danger of introducing very acrid substances into the nostrils. In my manuscript notes, taken at Sii* Astley Cooper's Anatomical Lec- tm-es, I find mention made of a case, where phrenitis and death were brought on in a gentleman, by the Sm'geon making use of a highly stimulant application, for the cure of ozcena. I cannot conclude the surgical Anatomy of the nose, without making a few additional observations on the antrum maxiUare, vel Highmorianum, a large cavity in the upper jaw-bone. On examining the antrum in the dry bone, we find that the jjalate plate of the OS maxiUare superius forms its floor, and that the first, second, and third molar teeth usually pene- trate into the cavity; or that if they do not, a thin plate of bone only is intervening. The roof of the antrum is formed by the orbitar plate of the bone; th* 2 c

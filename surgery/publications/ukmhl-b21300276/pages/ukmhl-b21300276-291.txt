i 265 From the ai'ch of the aorta arise three consi- derable vessels, viz.â€”the arteria iimominata, the left carotid, and the left subclavian. The left subclavian vein crosses the roots of the vessels, but more espe- cially those of the left carotid, and the arteria innomi- nata. The trachea lies between the two carotid arteries, and behind the aiteria Innominata. The student should pay particular attention to the situation of the arch of the aorta, and the vessels which originate from it; for the arch or curvature is a frequent seat of aneurism. When the tumour is large it presses forwards on the upper bone of the sternum, and the extremities of the first ribs, and will frequently cause an absorption of these parts. It presses backwards on the trachea, and oesophagus, hence the difficulty of breathing and deglutition in cases of this kind. There are no positive signs by which incipient aneurism of the arch can be detected, but when the tumour becomes large, it will extend upwards so as to manifest itself by pulsation above the sternum. An aneurismal swelling of the curvatui-e has on this account been mistaken for aneurism of the arteria innominata, and of the left subclavian artery. The heart is pretty closely in contact with the surface of the pericardium; a penetrating wound in the cardiac region, therefore, could scarcely injure the latter without the former. Wounds of the peri- cardium and heart are mortal; but not immediately

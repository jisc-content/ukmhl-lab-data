In the Eighty-sixth number of the " Medical Repository,^'' there is a case related by Dr. Andrew Smith, shewing the remarkable effect of disease, in changing the colour of the iris. While examining the eyes of the soldiers in the garrrison, Isle of Wight, an individual presented himself with the iris of the right eye of a grey, and that of the left, of a light green colour. Upon inqui- ring into the history of this unusual appearance, Dr. Smith found that the left had only changed to a green colour within the last seventeen months, from the consequences, it was supposed, of a severe blow. The posterior surface of the iiis is dark, and radiated; the radii are named the ciliary processes. Sir Everard Home, in his *' Croonian Lecture on the Anatomical Structure of the Eye^'' mentions, that he has ascertained, by the microscope, the radii to be eighty in number; and that in the interstices between them are bundles of muscular fibres, which pass from the capsule of the vitreous humour, to the capsule of the lens. In the centre of the iris, is an opening, called, the pnpil, which is round in the human subject; hori- zontal, in grazing animals; and vertical, in those of the cat kind. Physiologists do not agree as to the stiiictiue of the iris; but from the pupil being susceptible of con-

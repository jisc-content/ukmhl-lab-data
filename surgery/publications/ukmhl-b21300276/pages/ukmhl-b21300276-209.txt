The student will learn from these remaiks, 1st.—That the side on which the angle of the mouth is deformed, is not the diseased side; the muscles diaw the corner upwards, from not being antagonized, or opposed; and 2dly.—That when there is a loss of muscular power, in the left arm and leg, the cause may be suspected to occupy the opposite side of the brain. There is no law in Pathology more general, than tliat the paralysis of the parts below the neck, is situated on the side opposite to that of disease in the brain; but still some exceptions to it have been men- tioned. M. Bayle, an eminent French Physician, has re-published the cases of Morgagni, and others, where pai'alysis occurred on the same side as the cerebral lesion. He attempts to explain these cases, by saying, that some fibres are found not to decussate, but to continue fi'om the brain to the spinal maiTow, or from the spinal marrow to the brain. This fact, so amply proved and demonstrated by Gall, offers, he thinks, the only rational solution which we yet possess of the exceptions to the general rule in question. Having carefully dissected the muscles, the stu- dent will observe their connections with other parts; particularly with the parotid duct and nerves. The parotid duct will be found, on carefully removing the fat, which is usually deposited between 2 A

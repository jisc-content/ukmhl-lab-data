277 neuroses of the opposite uiuscles; it is, therefore, the geueral point of insertion. The linese semihmai-es are formed by the union of the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus, to the aponeiu-oses of the obliquus internus and trausversalis. The lineae transversales are three or four lines, which intersect the recti muscles, and not to be distinctly seen until the anterior part of the sheath of these muscles has been laid open. The student is now to reflect the external oblique muscle towards the linea alba, and underneath he will find the obliquus internus vol ascendens. Some of the libres of this muscle take an oblique coui'se upwards, others proceed almost transversely across the abdomen, and others descend obliquely towards the pubis. The muscle is inserted fleshy into some of the ribs, and tendinous into other jjarts; but the expanded aponeu- rosis in fi-ont has this peculiarity; when it reaches the linea semilunaris, it splits into two lamina; one lamina goes before the rectus muscle, and under the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique, to the linea alba; the other layer passes to the linea alba, behind the rectus, excepting at the inferior portion of this muscle, where the whole of the tendon is found on the anterior part of the sheath. Under tlie obliquus internus, the student will find the fibres of the trausversalis passing from the internal surfaces of the cartilages of the inferior ribs, the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, the crest 4

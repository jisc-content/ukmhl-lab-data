184 are connected with the appendages of the eyes, with the ala^ of the nose, with the upper and lower lips, and the an<^les of the mouth. Under natural circum- stances, the mouth is in a transverse line, this in owing to the muscles on one side of the face being equally antagonized by those of the other; but if any thing happens to give greater power to those on one side, than to those on the other, the mouth is rendered awry, or oblique. Pain in the face, from an affection of the facial nerve, or from the irritation of a diseased tooth, will often cause a preternatural irritability of the muscles on the affected side, and during the pa- roxysm of pain, a convulsive motion will be observed, which, from habit, will sometimes continue, after the pain has subsided. The deformity which frequently occurs in the mouth, after an attack of hemiplegia, is attributable to the muscles npt being antagonized. A person receives an injury on the right side of the head, which throws liim half paralytic; we find, in this case, a dra\ving upwards of the left angle of the mouth; and the left arm and leg jjaralyzed. How are these symptoms to be exjjlained? The injury exists on the right side of the brain. The left comer of the mouth is drawn upwards, because the muscles on the right side of the face, are palsied. The arm and leg, on the opposite side to the injury of the brain, are paralyzed, in consequence of the nei*vous fibres decussating each other in the medulla oblongata; thus, "tlie fibres of the right side of the

because there is considerable difficulty in procuring it unmixed with the other fluids. Its operation would seem to be chemical, since it acts upon dead animal fibre, as well as aliments. The conjectvires on the manner in which the functions of digestion is per- formed, have been very numerous. In the days of mechanical philosophy, tlic stomach was supposed to triturate the food like a pair of mill-stones; but this hypothesis, together with those of concoction, of fer- mentation, and of putrefaction, have all, in their tui'n, given place to another view, founded on science and experiments. It is admitted now by all, that the gas- tric juice is the agent of digestion. Reaumur first stated, that digestion depended on chemical solution; and future experiments have confirmed the statement. Throughout the whole course of the large and small intestiues, we find a limpid Jluid, which is secreted by the follicles of the intestines. Its uses are to assist in chylification, and to facilitate the course of the alimentary, and stercoraceous matters, in the intes- tinal canal. Bile is the peculiar secretion of the liver, which is the largest gland in the body, and situated in the upper part of the abdominal cavity. The arrangement of the secretory apparatus in the liver is similar to that of other complex glands; there are arteries carrying the blood, from which the secretion takes })]acc; veins returning the superabundant quantity to the heart; and

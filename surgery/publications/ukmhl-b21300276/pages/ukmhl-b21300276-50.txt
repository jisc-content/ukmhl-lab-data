26 the state of health, and tlie extent of injury, are the grounds which expose the propriety, or impropriety of Surgical interference. Much then is left to the Practitioner, in the after treatment of fractures. Nature, now and then, requires to be controuled, or excited; she may be too active, or not active enough in her operations; and it is the province of good Surgery to be sedulously on the watch, in order to weaken her inordinate efforts, or to augment them when inefficient. The first thing, then, which indi- cates a disposition to repaii- a mischief, is an increased determmation of blood to the injured part; and this is salutary and necessary, so long as it is moderate. From this blood, the vessels secrete a mucous, or gelatinous substance; in a little time, this gradually increases in consistence, and takes on the true carti- laginous character; and in the cartilage, the earthy particles are deposited; thus, what was mucous, at the commencement of the re-union, becomes, by a series of changes, ti'ue bone. Here then, as in the original formation, Ave note three states,â€”mucous, cai'tilaginous, and osseous; the changes from the first to the last are, are in a similar way, progressive; and the circumstances which produce them, depend upon the same influence and actions. These facts prove a coincidence between Physiology in health, and Phy- siology in disease. Having considered the process of ossification, it is in natural order, next to inquire into the composition

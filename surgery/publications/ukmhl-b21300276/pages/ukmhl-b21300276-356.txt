328 from the bi achial artery, in the relation which that vessel most frequently bears to the cutaneous veins. The punctui-e of an artery in bleeding, gives rise to what is called an aneurismal varix, which is to be treated on the principle of wounded arteries. This is one of the most formidable accidents attendant on venae-sectio ; but there arc now and then other unplea- sant consequences; as inflammation of the vein, abscess, &c.; but I shall refer the student to Works on Sur- gery, for information on these subjects. The ulnar, radial, and interosseal arteries, in their course down the arm; their distribution in the hand; and their relation to the venae eomites, and nerves, are next to be studied. The superficial palmar arch is formed by the ulnar artery; the deep arch by the radial. Between the two, there are free inoscula- tions; 1st.—Through a branch called, the superfi- cialis volae, which is given off by the radial artery, near the wrist, and traversing the palm of the hand, joins the superficial arch. 2dly.—By the radialis indi- cis, which anastomoses at the tip of the fore-finger, with the ulnaris indicLs. 3dly.—By the aiteria pro- funda volae, which, after distributing branches to the interosseal muscles, and deep parts of the palm, ter- minates, by communicating with the aiteria ulnaris profunda ; thus, in whatever part, the ulnar, or raditil arteries should be obstructed by ligatui-e, there will remain amj)le resources for the circulation in the fore-

151 body, and apex; the base is fixed to the os liyoides ; but the apex is moveable. The substance of this organ is muscular, and the covering of it is the continuation of the lining membrane of the mouth. On the surface of the tongue are seen numerous small eminences, which are called papillae; some of them are much larger than others. They are divided into three classes; those near the base ai*e named, the pa- pillag capitatsE; those in the centre, the papillae medise; and those at the apex, the papillae minimae; they appear to be the terminations of the nerves; the first class excepted, which are supposed to be merely mucous glands. In the tongue, there axe three sets of nerves, viz.â€”the lingual, the glosso pharyngeal, and the gustatory. The lingual is believed to be the nerve of motion; the glosso pharyngeal, the nerve of secretion; and the gustatory, the nei've of taste; there is, how- - ever, a considerable intermixture between the sets. The arteries, veins, and nerves, of one side of the tongue, are separated from those of the other, by the longitudinal line, called, the Raphe linguae. The sense of taste resides in the papilla2 media?, et minimae. How sapid bodies act on these eminences, is a question Avhich Physiologists cannot satisfactorily answer. Some consider that their action is chemical; others think, that it is mechanical; but as it is neces- sary to the perfection of this function, that the sub-

75 his experiments, and the fact has been confirmed by after experimenters, that vegetables act in an opposite manner on the atmosphere to what we do; instead of absorbing oxygen, and emitting carbon, they emit oxygen, and absorb carbon; thus, the animal and vegetable kingdoms ai-e subservient to the well-doing of each other. To illustrate furtlifir the wise provision furnished by natui-e, I shall extract a passage fi'om Dr. Curry's Observations on Apparent Death: " To Dr. Priestley," he says, " we owe that beautiful discovery of the mutual support which the animal and vegetable creation aiFord to each other, viz.—that animals, whilst dissolving, and putrifying after death, set loose in the atmosphere, a great quantity of niti'Ogen gas, which, if augmented beyond its due jiroportion, would tend to destroy those that still live; but that this gas is greedily absorbed by gi'o^ing vegetables, which retain and fix its basis as a part of their substance, whilst they give out, in exchange, a quantity of vital air, which, in its turn, is necessary to the maintenance of respiration, and animal life." We have seen that the constituent parts of atmos- pheric air, are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid gas, besides adventitious materials; the j)roportions in which they are combined, are nearly thus—22—77— and one; although some chemists have given different resvdts; but not, however, widely different.

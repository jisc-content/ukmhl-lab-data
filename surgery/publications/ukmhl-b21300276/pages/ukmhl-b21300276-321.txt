293 The fossae of the ilia aie occupied by the iliaci interni muscles; and each iliacus tendon passes over the fore part of the pelvis, to be implanted into the trochanter minor of the thigh-bone. On the inner side of this muscle, is seen the psoas magnus, which arises from the sides and transverse processes of the last dorsal and four first lumbar vertebrae, and descends to be inserted into the trochanter minor. The iliacus intemus, and psoas magnus, are covered by a thin aponem-otic membrane, named, the fascia iliaca, which will be spoken of at another time, as contributing to form the sheath of the femoral vessels; and over this membrane, we find the peritoneum. In addition to the use which these muscles have in bending the thigh on the tnink, they afford a cushion-like support to the intestines, and the gravid uterus in the female. Certain arteries, veins, and nerves, must now be noticed. The common iliac artery and vein are seen at the inner edge of the psoas muscle; they soon divide into the internal and external iliac branches. The student should observe the situation of the common iliac, which has been tied by Dr. Stevens. This operation might be rendered necessai-y by aneu- rism of either of the branches of the internal iliac, or of the trunk of the external iliac, when the tumour extends to the origin of the vessel. On the iliacus internus, and psoas magnus, are

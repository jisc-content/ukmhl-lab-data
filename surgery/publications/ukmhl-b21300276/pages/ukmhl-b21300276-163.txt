139 cataracts, there are two other methods, viz.â€”clepi-es- sion, and extraction; but to the latter, most Surgeons give the preference. With respect to gutta serena, or amaurosis, we may pronoimce the disease, in many cases, to be incu- rable ; the seat of the cause being beyond the scope of investigation; but there are some cases, as those de- pendent on plethora; and paralysis, that occasionally admit of cure.

In his " Surgical Memoirs^'' he relates cases to prove it. The subject of one, was the son of an English corporal, where the blindness had suddenly supei'vened, after he had ti'avelled, bare-foot, from Corimna to Valladolid, in a severe winter. No doubt was entertained of the existence of amam-osis, yet the irides retained their sensibility.

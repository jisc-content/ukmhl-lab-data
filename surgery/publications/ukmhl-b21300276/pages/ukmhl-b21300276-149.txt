125 levator raises it; the depressor directs it towards the ground; and to give degrees of obliquity to it, there are two oblique muscles. The four first of these muscles are, by soirie Anatomists, called the " recti when they act in succession, the eye is rolled in its socket; but when all are in action at the same time, the globe is fixed. Mr. C. Bell communicated to the " RoyaJj Society," in 1823, a Paper on certain motions of the eye, which have hitherto been imdescribed. Thus, every time the eye-lids atre brought together, fo covet the globe, the eye turns upwards; without which motion, it would not be properly moistened, nor the particles of dust removed from its surface. During sleep, the ball is turned upwards, so as to lodge under the superior lid. These movements are rapid and involuntaiy, while others ai-e under the govern- ment of the will; and for the purpose of directing the eye to different objects. Hitherto, both the oblique, and the straight musclfes, have been regarded as volun- tary ; but Mr. BeU maintains, that the oblique are for the performance of the insensible motions; and the recti, for those imder the command of volition. That the functions of these muscles are insepai-ably con- nected with the retina, and cease to act when it becomes insensible, while the oblique muscles come into play, and draw the pupil upwaids, beneath the upper eye-lid. Hence that turning of the eye-ball which we witness in sleep, in fainting, or in death, is but the indication of insensibility.

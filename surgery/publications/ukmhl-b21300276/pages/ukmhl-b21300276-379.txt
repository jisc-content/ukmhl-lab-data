351 extension which the peritoneum is capable of under- g'oiug:. Every body knows, too, the elFect of pressure in renderiug a thin membrane, a dense and thick fascia; the student must, therefore, exjject the coverings of a hernial tumour to be much thicker than in their natural state. Instead of finding the fascia superficialis a layer of cellular membrane, loosely matted together, he will see it in the form of a dense fascia. Instead of the delicate tunic which the cremaster assumes, we find, that the muscle acquires a surprising thickness: and the ti-anspai-ent peritoneum is often, in old and voluminous herniae, exceedingly changed in its appear- ance. Besides the alteration in sti-ucture, the parts will be more or less altered in position; thus, instead of there being an inch, or more, between the external and internal rings, they are nearly brought together; and there will be differences in the relation of otlier pai'ts. An oblique ijiguinal hernia takes the course of the spermatic cord. The intestine, or epiploon, enters the inguinal canal by the internal abdominal ling, and carries with it that portion of peritoneum, which lined the posterior surface of the ring. Hernia in the ingui- nal canal will often elude detection, as the dense apo- neurosis of the external oblique will not yield; and therefore no tumour can be perceived. Patients have died from strangulation in this case, without the cause being at all suspected. When the hernia is in the canal, the sac is covered by the common integument, the

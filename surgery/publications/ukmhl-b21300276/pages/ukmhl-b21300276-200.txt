178 compression, in consequence of a rupture of blood- vessels, effusion, or suppuration. The symptoms of compression are very similar to those of concussion, with these exceptions; the pupils of the eye are usually more affected, the pulse is slow and labouiing', and the breathing stertorous. Com- pression may arise fi'om any cause which produces an encroachment on the brain, as depression of bone, extiavasation of blood, effusion of lymph, or the formation of matter; but these causes do not necessa- rily give birth to symptoms of compression. The summary of the practice, in the different injuries of the head, is as follows:â€” In case of concussion, with, or without fracture, depletion, with the common auxiliary means, must be had recourse to, after the depressed state of the system, immediately consequent on the violence, has gone'off In case of compression, from simple fracture, with depression of bone, full bleeding must be em- ployed ; should the symptoms not yield, the fragment must be raised. In case of compression, from compound fracture, with depression of bone, we are advised immediately to trephine.

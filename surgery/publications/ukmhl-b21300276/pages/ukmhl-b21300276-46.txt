22 Bone is the hardest and strong-cst stnicture in the body, and its functions require ihat it should be so. We should suspect, from a superficial examination of this substance, and from its resisting for ao-es the decomposition which dead organic matter usually undergoes, that it is not an organized stiucture,â€”that is to say, not possessing ai'teries, veins, nerves, and absorbents; but injection proves that it is vascular; and the phenomena of disease inform us, that it has nerves and absorbents. But there is superadded to these, and its animal substance, an earthy material, upon the presence of which depends its peculiarity in solidity, weight, and strength. Before mentioning the composition of bone, we will advert to its origin, and the process of its formation, two very interesting physiological inquiries. Its origin is to be sought for in that state of existence, when an impenetrable mys- tery hangs over all the operations of nature, and when human scrutiny cannot detect the secret changes wliich are taking place in organizing matter. In the early period of conception, all the systems of the body are, to our observation, homogeneous; the bones, the muscles, and the other organs, are all apparently of the same nature; and until the formative faculty gives to each part its peculiai* character, we are at a loss how to distinguish them. We may call the first condition of the foetus, mucous; therefore, bone, at its origin, may be said to be in a mucous, or gelatinous state. A degree of firmness, which it soon accjuires, enables us to detect it from surrounding parts, as it changes

131 traction aiul dilatation, the most prevalent, and pro- bable opinion is, that it is in part, if not wholly niusciilai". Some have supposed, that the diminution and expansion may be explained by the changes which the vascular stj-uctiue of the iris experiences fi-om sanguineous determination; thus, when the retina is impressed with a too vivid light, blood is determined to the iris in an increased- quantity, by which the Tessels are distended, and the apeitm'e of the pupil encroached on; but when the stimulus is withdrawn, the blood recedes, and the pupil resumes its original size. Blumenbach thinks, that the dilatation and con- traction neither depend on muscularity, nor vascularity, but on a " vita propria;" to which term it is not easy to attach a precise meaning. Analogy, and the cir- cumstances which affect the pupil, must incline us to the opinion, that the iris is muscular; after death, it, like all the muscles of the body, is in a state of relax- ation, the pupil is consequently dilated; and when, from other causes, muscular action is suspended, or weakened, we find the state of the iris to correspond. Under the choroid coat, is the third tunic, which is called the retina, it embraces, as it were, the vitreous humour. To say, that the retina is the expansion of the optic nerve, is not anatomically correct; for minute researches have shown, that the nervous pulp is situated between two tunics; the external one, named, tunica Jacobi, in honour of the discoverer; the internal, the tunica vasculosa; there

182 of the parotid gland; but it soon becomes more super- iicia], and its course can be easily followed. This is the vessel in which ai-teriotomy is performed, and in executing this operation, Mr. Allan Bums recom- mends that the Surgeon should make firm pressure with the fore finger of the left hand, on the artery, a little higher than the point, where he intends to open it, and with the thumb of the same hand, a little lower. In this way the canal of the vessel is kept distended, by intercepting a quantity of blood. Then with a scalpel the surgeon is to make an incision about half an inch in length, down to the artery, which he next punctures longitudinally, with a lancet. Having removed the pressure made with the thumb, the blood flows. To check the flow, when sufficient has been obtained, a compress, retained by a proper bandage, will commonly be found sufficient; should, this not succeed, the vessel is to be divided across, this acts by enabling the extremities to draw themselves within the cellular membrane, which, by entangling the blood, facilitates the formation of a coagulum. The editor of the last edition of Bum's *' Anatomy of the head and neck^^ recommends tying the artery, in preference to either of the above plans; for security, this practice may now and then be necessary, but it cannot be so in all cases. The temporal artery is occasionally affected with aneurism; a case of this kind was admitted in March last, under the care of Mr. Tyrrell, Surgeon of St.

REMARKS ON MEDICO-CHIRURGICAL EDUCATION. The wish of a pai-ent to bring up his sou to the medical profession, ought to be seconded by a cor- respontling wish on the part of the son. Family prospects and circumstances may influence a father to recommend to his child a pailicular pursuit in life; but those considerations should give way to a disin- clination, or distaste for the studies connected with it.â€”Without a fondness for these, the student will never bestow on the acquisition of a knowledge of his profession those exertions, which are indis- pensable to the accomijlishment of the arduous task imposed on him; nor will such a man ever rise above mediocrity in its practice. There is no profession that requires more assiduity and application than the medical; none, where the extent of knowledge neces- sary- for the successful practice of it is so unbounded; none, more interesting when the objects of it are congenial to the temper of the mind; but none, which, in the absence of congeniality, is so calculated to excite disgust.

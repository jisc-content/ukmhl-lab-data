332 to whether rc-union takes place when the fracture is within the ligament, had scarcely been expressed amongst the Hospital Surgeons of this country; but the French Surgeons and oui-selves have always been at variance on this question. The arguments, however, on this branch of Pathology, ai'e so conflicting, as we shall presently show, as to make us cautious in vindi- cating, in a positive manner, either of the opposite opinions. Desault states his full conviction that fractures of the cervix femoris, occurring in a healthy constitution, will unite, on the average, in about forty days, and generally without deformity. In tlie " Parisian Chi^ rurgical Journal,^'' published many years ago by Desault, who was then Principal Suigeon to the Hotel Dieu, we find several cases of this kind, which were successfully treated. Let us now oppose to this opinion, the observa- tions of Sir Astley Cooper, whose experience has not fallen far short of that, which Desault himself enjoyed.

Secondly, a fracture through the neck of the thigh-bone, at its junction with the tro- chauter major, wliich is external to the capsular

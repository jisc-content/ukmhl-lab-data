The Blood is that fluid which circulates in the cavities of the heart, arteries, and veins. In man, it is of a red colour; but in some animals, it is completely coloiu-less. Whilst cii'culating, and immediatel}'^ after being drawn from an artery, or a vein, it appears an homogeneous mass; but when removed from the vessel, it soon loses its uniform consistence, and resolves itself into two pai'ts,—servim and crassamentum. By exposing the serum to a temperature of 150 or 160 degrees, it assumes a solid form; this substance, in chemical language, is albumen; and by slicing, and squeezing it, a small quantity of fluid may be ex- pressed, called the serosity of the blood.

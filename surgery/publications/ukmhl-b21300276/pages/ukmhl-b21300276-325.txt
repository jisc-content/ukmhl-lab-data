â€¢207 Let the stiuleiit now examine the urinary and g^enital organs in a particular manner. He should observe the form and sti-ucture of the bhukler, the ter- mination of the ureters obliquely between its coats, the internal orifice of the urethra, the prostate gland, and the structure and appearances of the urethra throughout its whole coui-se. The urethra extends fi'om the neck of the bladder to the extremity of the penis; not in a straight, but curved line. From its commencement, it proceeds downwards and forwards through the prostate gland, and under the symphysis pubis. It afterwards passes through the spongy body to the extremity of the penis. In the first place, it is in the prostate gland ; then in the membranous part; and lastly, in the corpus spon- giosum. The prostatic portion of the canal is about one inch in length; the membranous the same; and the spongy, about seven inches; nine inches being the usual length of the urethra. The canal is not of the same size throughout its whole extent. It is dilated near the bladder; contracted In the prostate; still more contracted in the membranous portion; dilated in the glans; and conti-acted again at the orificium urethrae. On slitting up the urethra, we find it lined with a mucous membrane, and we expose the large lacunas, near the glans, which furnish the morbid secretion discharged in gonoiThcea; and the Verumontanum, 2 F

It is cleai-, that after the testis has carried with it the peritoneum which was at the ring, a communication will exist between the cavity of the abdomen, and that of the elongated sac, constituting the tunica vaginalis reflexa; but, naturally, this communication does not long remain, for an adhesive process usually takes place, by which the ueck of the sac is closed; this, though commonly, is not, however, constantly the case; and a default of this kind gives rise to the dis- - eases before mentioned. Between hernia congenita, and other herniae, there is this difference; in the for- mer, the tunica vaginalis reflexa forms the hernial sac; in the latter, the sac is jiroduced by a gradual stretch- ing, or elongation of the peritoneum, from the pres- sure of the protruded viscera]: and between hydrocele in children, from the above stated cause, and the com- mon hydrocele at a more advanced age, there is this difference; in the former, there is a communication between the cavity of the abdomen, and that of the tunica vaginalis reflexa; but in the latter, the tunica vaginalis reflexa is a bag without an opening. In the hydrocele of childhood, and of adult age, the effused fluid occupies the same situation, viz.â€”the tunica vaginalis reflexa; and the testis, with its tunica vagi- nalis testis, is behind the serous collection. There is a variety of congenital hernia produced,

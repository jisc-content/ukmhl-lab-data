366 aneurism, has been so frequently performed, as to leave no doubt on the mind, as to the efficacy of the treatment, and its freedom from danger. The usual anastomosing vessels are, the profunda and its branches, which communicate with the rami muscu- lares, and other branches of the femoral artery; also, with the articular arteries of the popliteal. When the femoral artery is oblitex*ated to the profunda branch, which is sometimes the case, even when the ligature is applied on the vessel low down, the rami perfo- rantes of the profunda femoris, and the rami arlicu- lares of the popliteal, are the channels which the blood takes, to arrive at the lower part of the limb. In the dissection of the ham, we find, under the skin, much cellular membrane; and then a strong fascia which binds down the vessels and nerves of this part, which are embedded in much fat, and celltilar membrane. The nerve first appears ; and close to the bone are, the popliteal artery, and vein. The ham- strings are formed by the tendons of the flexor mus- cles of the leg. The branches of the popliteal artery are, the superior external and internal, and the infe- rior external and internal articular arteries; and the arteria; surales, which are spent chiefly on the head of the gastrocnemius exteinus muscle. The articular ar- teries freely communicate with each other, and with the recurrent tibial, and by these, the circulation is carried on, after the course of the blood in the main tiuuk is stopped.

that we should not limit our examination to separate, or individual parts, but extend it to the great whole in connexion; I repeat, however, that parts must be understood, before any other thing be attempted. The bones of the Cranium are eight in number, six of which aie proper to the cranium, viz.—the os frontis, two ossa parietalia, two ossa temporalia, and the OS occipitis; and two common to the cranium and face, viz.—the os sphenoides, andos ethmoides. These bones are joined together by ii-regular lines, called sutures, which are variously named. The suture con- necting the OS frontis with the ossa parietalia, is called the coronal suture.—The one which unites the ossa parietalia, the sagittal suture.—The sutures joining the OS temporale on each side to the os parietale, os occipitis, OS sphenoides, and os malae, are named the squamous or temporal; the additamentum suturae lamb' doidalis; sphenoid; and zygomatic. Those uniting tlie occipital bone to the parietal bones, temporal bone on either side, and sphenoid bone, are called the lambdoidal, the additamentum suturas lambdoidalis, and sphenoid sutures. The sphenoid bone is connected with surrounding bones by the sphenoid suture; and the ethmoid by the ethmoid suture. The bones of the Face are fourteen in number; twelve of them are in paii-s, the remaining two are single. The pairs are, the ossa malai-um, ossa unguis, ossa nasi, ossa maxillaria superiora, the ossa spon-

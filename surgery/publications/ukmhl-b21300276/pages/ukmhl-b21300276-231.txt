207 catasti'Djilje which they witnessed. The natural infe- rence, Avhich we should be induced to draw is, that such an accident is occasionally unavoidahle. Inflammation of the tonsil gland sometimes tei- minates in chronic enlargement; I have seen several cases of this sort. I have also frequently seen too, an enlarged and indurated state of the gland to succeed to suppiu-ation. This disease often yields to blisters; but from the impleasant, and even painful sensation which the patient comjilains of as attending it, a removal of the whole, or a part of the tumoui", by caustic, the actual cautery, ligature, or excision, is sometimes obliged to be resorted to. With regard to the caustic, I believe it to be, in the majority of cases, totally inefficacious. The actual cautery, carefully conducted to the tumour, promises success. Excision is often attended with the loss of so much blood as to excite alarm ; I have been present at two operations by exci- sion; in one, the bleeding was inconsiderable; in the other, performed by Baron Larrey, the blood flowed so freely, that the operator was induced to apply the actual cautery, in order to restrain it. With respect to strangulating the tumour, by passing a ligature about it, this is certainly the safest operation; and managed as Mr. Grainger, the father of the Lectm-er, of the Borough, has pointed out in his " Medical and Sur- gical RemarTis,^'' published in 1815, an operation not difficult to perform. After mentioning the different methods which have been proposed by Want, Cbesel-

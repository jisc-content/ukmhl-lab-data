228 the whole of the coals give way by ulceration; and in these cases, the coat, or coats remaining entire, and the soft parts near them, or the soft parts oidy, when all the coats yield, form the bouiidaiies of the sac. An aneurism, at its commencement, is accompanied by a symptom which clearly denotes the nature of the affection; that symptom is pulsation; but in a more advanced period of the disease, it is more obscure; and in the last stage, not to be felt. The progress of the disease is sometimes sIoav, and sometimes exceed- ingly rapid; a spontaneous cure of it seldom happens ; therefore, if it were not for tlie interference of art, the disease would almost invariably terminate in the burst- ing of the sac, and death. The treatment of aneurism may be divided into medical and surgical. On the former, much reliance cannot be placed; but digitalis, and low diet may, by moderating vascular action, retard the fatal issue of the disease. The only mean, independent of the opera- tion, that can be employed with probable advantage, is compression, not partial, but general; that is to say, not to the tumour only, but to the whole member, for it is in aneurism of the arteries of the members alone, that compression can be used. There are cases on record, in which, it is said, compression has effected a ciue, but it is in certain stages only of anemism, that it can be advantageously, nay safely applied. If there be the least degree of inflammation of tlie aixeurismal

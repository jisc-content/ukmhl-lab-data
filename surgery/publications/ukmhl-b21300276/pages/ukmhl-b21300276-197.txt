175 ft very little of the bone is exposed to violence. Bu the ossa parietalia are only defended by the scalp, tendon of the occipito frontalis, and pericranium; and, in couipaiison with the other bones (a portion of the temporal excepted) they are thinner, and therefore not capable of resisting any violent injury. Whether the faculties of the mind reside in a pai-t, or in the whole of the cerebral organ, is a question which the present state of Physiology cannot determine; but that they have their- seat within the cranium, seems to be proved by the effects of injuries, and diseases of the brain. A man receives a blow on the head, the concussion of the brain suspends its functions; the man falls, and loses all sense, and voluntary power. The same happens in a fit of apo- plexy ; but here, the cause is compression, not concus- sion. The effects of a blow on the head are not always severe in proportion to the violence with which the blow was struck. A slight blow will sometimes kill; and other cases occur where a severe one has occa- sioned merely a temporary stun; the difference arises, in a general way, from the seat of injury; some parts of the head being better defended than others, as we have ah-eady shown. For a blow on the head to kill, it is not necessary that the brain should immediately suffer. A simple woimd of the scalp may termi- nate fatally, in the way we have mentioned; the chance of this fatal termination is considerably enhanced by mal-treatment of the wound; thus, liga-

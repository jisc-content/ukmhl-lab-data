Where, howevei*, there is no such direct provision as this, we must look for an auxiliary power of adjustment, and the weight of reasoning seems to be in favour of its being seated in the iris, which, from its capa- bility of contracting, and expanding the aperture of the pupil, excludes certain rays of light, and admits such only as ai*e necessaiy for distinct vision. This phenomenon of vision is one of much interest; and Physiologists ai*e by no means agreed in their expla- nation of it. In the number of the " Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh^'' which appeared in the spring of the present year, there is a Paper by Dr. Knox, on the comi^arative Anatomy of the eye, in which the author states, that that part of the organ called the ciliary ligament, is not ligamen- tous, but muscular in structure; and that it is on this, that depends the ability which the eye has of adapting itself to distance. These are amongst the facts tvhich Dr. Knox brings forward, in support of his opinion,— 1. —The developement of the ciliaiy muscle follows the ratio of the strength of vision; or rather the accommodating powers of the eye, in the various classes of animals. 2. —When examined by the microscope, it puts

138 artificial one, by the method of Cheselden, Scarpa, Gibson, Adams, or Ware. Opacity of the lens, from effused lymph behind the capsule, must be treated by introducinj^ a needle, and puncturing the capsule so as to allow the aqueous humour to liave access to the lymph, by which it will be dissolved, and subsequently absorbed. The aqueous humour has a powerful solvent property; on a knowledge of which is founded the treatment of soft and milky cataract, and the late method recommended by Sir William Adams, of treating hard cataracts, viz.â€”by cutting the lens into small portions, and placing them in the anterior chamber of the eye. Analysis teaches us nothing on what the .solvent property of the aqueous humour depends; for the most active ingredient which it contains, is muriate of soda; but that it is endued with this power in an extraordinai-y degree, is proved by a circumstance which occurred to Mr. Cline, senr. He was operating for cataract, a spasm seized the eye after the needle was introduced, and a portion of it snapped off. Bad tonsequences were apprehended; but, to the great gratification and astonishment of the Surgeon, the fragment of the needle was dissolved, and afterwards absorbed. This interesting fact is mentioned by Sir Astley Cooper in his Anatomical Lectures. Besides Sir William Adams' operation, which is not, I believe, very extensively practised in haid

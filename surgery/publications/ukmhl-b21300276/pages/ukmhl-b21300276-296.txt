270 costal and abdominal muscles will be paralyzed; but the diaphragm will continue its actions. This fact was known to Galen; for amongst other curious expe- riments, he mentions, that if the spinal marrow be cut at the sixth cervical vertebra, all the parts below the section fall into a state of paralysis, excepting the diaphragm, which moves and supports respiration. These phenomena are easily explained. We have given the most practical and interesting points in the Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology, of the structures of the thorax. The student may now remove the viscera for more minute dissection; but as he. will, by and by, have to attend to the surgical Ana- tomy of the subclavian arteries, he must, in taking away the heart and lungs, leave the arch of the aorta, and its vessels; the vena cava superior; the trachea, from a little above its bifurcation into the bronchi; and be careful not to injure the diaphragm, as the particular demonstration of, and practical allusions to this muscle, remain yet to be given.

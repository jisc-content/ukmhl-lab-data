334 Astley Cooper, is the absence of ossific action in the head of the thigh-bone, from being separated from its cervix; its life being then solely supported by the ligamentuni teres, which has only a few minute vessels ramifying from it to the head of the bone. May we not, with propriety, add a fourth, viz.— the age of the patient? Fractures of the cervix femoris occur, in eight cases out of ten, in persons far advanced in years, and we know that the little vitality of bone, in old age, often proves a preventive to re-union in any situation. Sir Astley Cooper's opinion, then, is dii'ectly opposed to that of Desault, and other Siu'geons; he maintains, that re-union has never haijpened in his practice, when the fracture is ivithin the capsular ligament, and retains no connection with the trochanter major. On the other hand, we find distinctly stated in the sixth case of Desault, that a fracture through the middle of the neck of the thigh-bone, w as united, without deformity, on the forty -fourth day. Sir Astley Cooper believes that re-union can take place in the second and third species, but not in the first. This belief may certainly lead to the error wliich M. Roux apprehends, viz.—that those supposed to be within the ligament will be left to themselves ; those without it, only, being capable of consolidation.

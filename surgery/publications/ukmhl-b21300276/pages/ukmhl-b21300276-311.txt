283 flexure of the colon, in the venter of the right ilium, we find the ccecum covered anteriorly, and bound down by peritoneum, like the sigmoid flexiu-e of the colon ; the ascending portion of the colon is covered like the descending; and the right kidney, like the left. The spleen is connected with the left extremity of the stomach, by that portion of jjeritoneum which goes over its anterior surface, and marked m in the dia- gram, which portion on the right side passes towards the concavity of the liver, to form the anterior lamina of the omentum minus, and on the left side after covering the spleen, it goes to the diaj)hragm, to connect the spleen and stomach to that muscle. After breaking through the omentum minus to show the smaller sac of peritoneum, it will be seen that the spleen is loosely joined to the pancreas by that portion of the membrane which gives an anterior covering to the pancreas and duodenum, thus it is wholly encircled by peritoneum. These views of this reflected membrane teach us, that some of the organs of the abdomen are only par- tially, whilst others are completely invested by it. The bladder, rectum, coecura, kidnies, duodenum, and pancreas are only partially covered, all the rest are wholly 80.

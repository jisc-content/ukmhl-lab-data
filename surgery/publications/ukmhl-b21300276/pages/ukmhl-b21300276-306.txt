280 To demonstrate the reflection of the peritoneum, we must describe it as consisting of two bags, which sometimes communicate with each other, by means of the forameii of Winslow; but it is no more possible to say, wliere this membrane begins, and where it ends, than it is to determine the points of commencement and ter- mination in a circle; but we may imagine such points. There is much difficulty, in conveying an accurate idea of the manner in which the pei'itoneum covers the ditFerent organs of the abdomen and pelvis. In a strictly lateral observation, only a few of its turnings can be shown; but a good notion of them can be given by an oblique deviation from the front view. The parietes of the abdominal and pelvic cavities are to be imagined as entire, but transparent, so that the viscera may be seen behind them: in confor- mity to this idea, the accompanying diagram has been executed; but it must not be considered as cor- rectly representing the relative position of parts.

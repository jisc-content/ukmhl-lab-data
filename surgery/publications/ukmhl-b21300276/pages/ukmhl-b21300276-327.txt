From the extremity of the os coccygis to the under edge of the symphysis pubis, we have full five inches and a half in the diy bones, and about five in the recent subject; but we may consider this distance as capable of being increased in young females, in consequence of the mobility of the coccyx. . , The dimensions of the foetal head at the full period of utero gestation, are, in a general way, as follow: The longest line is from the vertex, or crown of

ON THE UPPER EXTREMITIES In order thoroughly to understand the relative situation of the soft parts of the upper extremity, cer- tain preparatory information is necessary, and this I shall, in a brief way, put the student in possession of. The soft parts are more or less connected with hard ones, and the muscles act upon the bones through the medium of joints ; a knowledge of the bones and joints" should therefore precede any other inquiry. Two bones enter into the composition of the shoulder, viz.â€”the clavicle, and scapula; the clavicle is attached at one exti'emity to the sternum and first rib; at the other, to the acromion scapulae; and it forms an arch over the nerves and vessels going to the axilla. The scapula is confined to the trunk, posteriorly, by means of muscles only. The clavicle, and edges of the shoulder-blade, are to be felt through their cover ings, so too are the spine, coracoid process, and acromion of the latter bone ; thus, a derangement from fracture or dislocation is easily recognised. The shoulder-joint is formed by the scapula and OS humeri.

44 in the possession of all men. To the student, a thorough knowledge of these la>vs may lead to deduc- tions of great practical importance. The muscular system is as little liable to disease as any system of parts in the body; but it furnishes us with many signs of disorder in other organs. In vigorous and healthy persons, the muscles are firm; but in weak persons, they are soft and flabby. Their power is, in a general way, in proportion to their bulk; but a remarkable fact is observable in certain cases of lunacy, where the power of muscles seems to be extraordinarily increased. In fevers of low type, the power is much diminished; and in paralysis, it is altogether destroyed. Cramp consists in a spasmodic contraction of one or several muscles; this painful affection, when attendant on labour, is to be referred to the pressure of the child's head on the nerves distributed to the muscles of the thigh. There is a species of cramp called tetanus, which is exceedingly dangerous. Tetanus is an involuntary and almost constant con- traction of all, or some of the muscles of the body, while the senses are unaffected. It may be either idiopathic, or symptomatic. In most instances, it succeeds to punctured, and lacerated wounds, espe- cially when tendons and nerves arc involved in the injury, and in these cases, the disease is often fatal.

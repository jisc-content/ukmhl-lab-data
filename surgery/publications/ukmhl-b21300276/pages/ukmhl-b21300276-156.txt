132 are then, other parts composing the retina, besides the pulpy expansion of the nerve. The tunica sclerotica, the tunica choroides, and the retma, are the three perfect coats of the eye. The sclerotica is considered by some writers, to be a continuation of the duia mater, a thick membrane which lies immediately under the skull; and the cho- roides, a continuation of the pia mater, a fine thin membrane, which adheres closely to the brain. Galen, and all the old Anatomists, believed that the tunica sclerotica was a continuation of the dura mater; but most modern Anatomists do not think so ; nor do they believe that the tunica choroides is the product of the pia mater. The sclerotic coat is very much thicker and stronger than the diu*a mater, and there is nothing but the extreme vasculaj ity of the two membranes, that can identify the tunica choroides with the pia mater. The humours of the eye are three, viz.â€”the a<pieous, the crystalline, and the vitreous. The aqueous humour occupies the chambers of the eye; its somxe is the vessels of the iris. The chrystalline lens, although commonly called a humour, is a solid double convex substance. Its anterior sui'face, however, is more flattened than its posterior, which is received into a depression of the vitreous humour. The lens is confined in its situation

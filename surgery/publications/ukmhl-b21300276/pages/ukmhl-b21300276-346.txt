318 When this accident occurs, the elbow is thrown into a state of flexion, and the patient is incapable of spontaneously extending the joint; the flexion of the elbow results from the flexor muscles having no anta- gonists ; and the olecranon is detached from the body of the ulna, and pulled ujjwards, by the action of the triceps muscle. A fracture of the ulna often occurs at its inferior part, because it is smaller and less defended by soft 6tructm*es than the upper. One of its diagnostic maiks, is a depression on the inside of the fore-arm, which is caused by the pronator radii quadi-atus muscle drawing the lower fragment towards the radius. The radius, however, is more frequently broken than the ulna, because it is the princii^al supjiort of the hand. This accident is mai-ked by the hand falling prone; partly from its own weight, but principally from the action of the pronating muscles. When both bones are fractured, the fragments are pushed together; a longitudinal derangement is rendered almost impossible, by the two bones being united, throughout their Avhole length, by the inter- osseous ligament. In the reduction, or what is the more common expression, in the setting of fractures, tliis grand principle must be borne in mind, viz.â€”to place the limb in such a position as will relax the most powerful

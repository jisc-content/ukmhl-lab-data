Xhe nails and hairs are the appendices to the skin; and like the cuticle, are inorganized, and insen- sible substances; the former are secreted by a glandular structure; the latter gi'ow from roots or bulbs, situ- ated in the cellular membrane, under the skin, According to the experiments of Mr. Hatchett, hair consists of gelatine, and coagulated albumen; besides which it is said to contain oils, iion, oxide of njanganese, lime, silica, and sulphur. We have now considered the five species of sen- sations, which convey information to the mind, viz.'— seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching. The two first of these senses are produced by media, which modify the impressing agents; but for the three last, it is required, that the object be brought into contact with the organ to be impressed; thus the odorous particles must be applied to the pituitary mem- brane, in order to be smelt; sapid bodies must come in contact with the tongue, in order to be tasted; and tactile bodies, with the skin, in order to be felt.

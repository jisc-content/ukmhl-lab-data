133 by a capsule, which is most probably derived from that of the vitreous humour. The third humour of the eye, is the vitreous, Avhich forms the principal bulk of the globe; its con- sistence is gelatinous, from its being made up of cells and water, which are surrounded by a capsule, named, the tunica hyaloidea, vel aranea. At the edge of the crystalline lens, this tunic is said to divide into two laminae; one lamina gives an anterior covering to the lens; and the other passes be- hind it. By this separation of the membrane, a canal is formed, called the Petitian canal, which may be inflated by means of a blow-pipe. These are the principal facts, connected with the coats and humours of the eye. The arteries of the appendages of this organ are the internal augidar, or nasal; the rami lachrymales; and muscular branches ; those of the tunics, are the arteria centi'alis retinae, and the ciliary branches. The arteries terminate in veins, and some of them in exhalent orifices. The nerves are, the motor oculi; the nervus patheticus; the ophthalmic branch of the nervus trigeminus; the abducens; and the optic, which ex- pands into the retina. Â«

60 left aiu-icle, and left vcivlriclc, v,c find the mitral valve; and between the left ventricle, and root of the aorta, are the three valvulae semilunares. The mechanism of these membranous structures bespeaks a beautiful adaptation of means, to the fulfilment of an end which could not be dispensed with. They sometimes become ossified, which destroys their function, and, in time, proves fatal to the individual, who is the subject of this morbid change. The heart is admirably constructed in all its parts, and so clear arc the uses of its structural arrangements, as to tell at once the purposes of this important organ. It will appear extraordinary, then, to all who know its anatomy, that the circulation of the blood remained undiscovered so long as it did; but the astonishment must cease, when we reflect, that the true anatomy of the heart was not accu- rately known, and that the discovery of its function was almost contemporaneous, with that of its real mechanism, aud stnicture. The assistance which Anatomy lends to Physio- logy, is strikingly illustrated by the important fruit of Harvey's industry, and obsei*vation. One of the principal circumstances which led him to detect the course of the current of blood, was an examination of the manner in which the valves are disposed. Other Anatomists, before him, shewed an imperfect know- ledge of some of the facts, which he afterwards eluci- dated, therefore Harvey derived assistance from tbs

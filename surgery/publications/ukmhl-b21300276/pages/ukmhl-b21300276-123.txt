Innumerable, almost, are the appearances which it assumes, under different circumstances; and, taken alone, the urine wQl often furnish the most satisfactory diagnosis of disease. The impediments to the discharge of m-ine from the bladder, are amongst the most formidable of all surgical diseases. They may reside in the bladder itself; in the prostate gland; or in the urethra. When the bladder loses its tone, from over distension, the catheter, and other means, will be necessary. When the prostate gland is enlarged, as it usually is in old age, there is often a mechanical obstruction to the flow of mine; and the catheter is the only method of giving relief.

Of late years, some of the most eminent Chemists have turned their attention to the examination of uri- nary calculi. Dr. Woolaston, Mr. Brande, Dr. Mar- cet. Dr. Henry, and Professor Vauquelin, have done much for this department of science. The materials usually met with in these concretions, are, uric acid;

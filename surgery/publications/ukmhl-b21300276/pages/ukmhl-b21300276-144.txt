J 20 explain some of the painful sensations which w(mien experience in the progress of parturition. The nerves are the auxiliary instruments of sen- sation, and voluntary motion; but the manner in which these functions are performed is still doubtful. An interesting theory has recently been advanced by Mr. C. Bell, upon the functions of nerves; I shall present it in brief to the reader. The common opinion entertained is, that the nerves are a series of tubes, which transmit to the different structures of the body, a power, which is secreted by the brain; but as Ana- tomy cannot demonstrate the nerves as tubular, Mr. Bell thinks, that the theory is not compatible with our real knowledge of the structural arrangement of nerves. Many parts are more abundantly supplied with nerves than others, and it has been supposed that this was necessary, because they stood in need of a more bountiful provision of nervous energy; but Mr. Bell is of opinion, that the hypothesis is fallacious. He says, however perfect the enjoyment of any sense, or however exquisite the function of any pai-t may be, cue nerve is sufficient to bestow the power; that, for one purpose, no more than one nerve is required; and that the accumulation of many nerves to augment the power, or improve the function, is as untiue in fact, as it is unphUosophical in theory. When a part is supplied with many nerves, it is for the pui'pose (Mr. Bell thinks) of enabling the organ to perform many offices, or to connect it with different operations of the

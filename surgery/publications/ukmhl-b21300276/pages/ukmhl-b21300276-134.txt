110 Gall and Spurzeim's anatomical researches have induced them to come to the following conclusions; thai the cincriteous and medullary substances of the brain, are inseparable, the one from the other; that the former is the matiix of the latter; that the medulla is composed of white fibres, which converge towards certain points, named, commissures; and that these commissures are the media of communication of the fibres of the opposite sides of the brain; in all this, I see no inconsistency, and nothing but what we may suppose to be ti'ue; but the doctrine is in its infancy, and if not well founded, will be sure to experience thÂ« fate of other anatomical ojnnions, equally plausible at the period of their birth; but found imtenable by the searchers after truth. We have stated, that Gall and Spurzeim believe that the cortical part of the brain is the matrix of the medullary; and consequently, of the nerves. Pro- fessor Tiedemann, who has made many interesting researches in the Anatomy of the brain, is opposed to this opinion. He says, that the cortical matter is formed after the medullary; and that the origin of the spinal and cerebral nerves, are visible before the least trace of the former can be observed. There are many other points, in which Anatomists disagree; we should therefore, as yet, be very cautious in inclining our minds to any particular doctrine. The brain is usually divided into three parts.

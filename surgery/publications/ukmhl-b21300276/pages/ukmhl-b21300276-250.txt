226 diseased action, and enlarge in sixe, it might he mis- taken for aneurism. Mr. Burns mentions the case of a woman who had a tumour of tlie magnitude of a wahixit on the side of the neck, which had a strong pulsation, owing to the ^.ction of the carotid under- neath; several who saw it, and who satisfied themselves with a superficial examina,tiou, firmly believed it to be aneurism, but it jiroved to be nothing more than an enlarged gland, Mr. Burns thinks that some of the reputed cases of aneurism in which spontaneous reco- very took place, had been merely glandular tumours placed over the course of a large arteiy, and receiving an impulse from the vessel beueath; an opinion which I believe to be true in many instances, It is not only in the neck, however, tliat an en- larged gland in the course of an artery, may lead to error in diagnosis; therefore we should carefully examine the swelling before speaking positively as to its natm*e. The pulsation may arise not only from the gland being situated over a large artery, but from a branch of an artery passing over the tumour. To discriminate between aneurism and the former case, the tumour should be pulled forwards, so as to be removed from the sphere of action of the artery; oi^ doing this, all pulsation will cease if the tumour be merely glandular. To decide between aneurism and the latter case; if aneurism, the pulsation is general; if a glandular tumour, the pulsation is only partial, or confined to a particular part of the swelling.

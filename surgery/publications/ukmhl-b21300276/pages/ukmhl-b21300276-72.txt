48 the liver, and pancreas; by which the bile, and pan- creatic juice are discharged fi-om their respective organs. There can be no doubt that these fluids are the agents, of chylification; although it has been dis- puted by some Physiologists, whether the former has any thing to do with the chylifiant process. The celebrated Blumenbach thinks that the bile separates itself into two portions, a serous, and resinous; and that the former probably mixes with the chyle, and is carried back to the blood, whilst the latter combines with the faeces, and acts as a stimulus to the peristaltic motion of the intestmes. The ingenious, and industrious French Physiologist, Richerand, entertains a similar opinion. After speak- ing of the combined pancreatic and biliary fluids, as servmg to penetrate the chyme, to render it fluid, to animalize it, to separate the chylous from the excre- mentitious pai't, and to precipitate whatever is not nutritious; he says,â€”" in bringing about this separa- tion, the bile itself seems to be divided into two parts; its oily, coloured, and bitter portion passes along with the excrements, sheathes them, and imparts to them the stimulating qualities necessary to excite the action of the digestive tube. Its albuminous and saline particles combine with the chyle, become incor- 2)orated to it, are absorbed along with it, and return into the ciixulation." How the separation is eflected, Richerand confesses his ignorance. He thinks that this act of the Animal Economy is as mysterious and inexplicable as the action of the brain, in producing thought; a phenomenon, which many Physiologists

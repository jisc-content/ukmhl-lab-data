ON THE HEAD. The Head is divided into the Cranium and Face. CRANIUM. In a foimer part of the volume, mention is made of the bones of the skull, and the manner in which they are united, hy means of sutures; but before the student can understand the attachments, and other circumstances, of the minute soft parts which are connected with the cranium and face, he must study well the elevations, depressions, foramina, and other remarkable points in the bones of the head. The united bones present a front, a lateral, a posterior, an upper, and an under surface. In the front view, the parts worthy of notice are, the prominences indicating the situation of the frontal sinuses; the two orbits; the seven portions of bone which enter into the composition of each orbit, and especially the os unguis, on account of its connexion with the lachrymal sac; the seat of the lachrymal gland in a depression behind the external angular process of the frontal bone; the fissure at the bottom of the orbit; the foramen opticum; the foramen supra- orbitarium; and foramen infra-orbitarium. y

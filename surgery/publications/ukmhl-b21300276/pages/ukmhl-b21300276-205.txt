lai The blood brought to the bniiii, and its mem- biiuies, by the carotid, and vertebral arteries, is by these sinuses, ^r veins, returned again to the heart. The superior longitudinal and lateral sinuses, are, however, the only vessels of importance in their rela- tion to external paits. By observing- their course, the student will learu to appreciate the observations made on the most objectionable places to the ajDplication of the trephine. Besides the situations where the sinuses are concerned, we mentioned the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone; behind which, in the view aimexed, is the left dura matral, or spinal artery. To impress on the memory of the student, the relation of that vessel to the zygoma, the anterior inferior angle of the bone has been retained. The principal ai'teries of the scalp are, the occi- pital, and temporal, which come oW from the external cai'otid. The occipital branch, after escaping from its connections with the deep parts, a little below the angle of the jaAv, is seen just at the root of the mastoid process of the os temporale, where it forms a sulcus, or groove, which is to be observed in the macerated bone; it then ascends, and divides into numerous branches. The temporal ailery is the continuation of the main trunk of the external carotid. At its origin, it is deep seated, and buried, as it were, in the substance

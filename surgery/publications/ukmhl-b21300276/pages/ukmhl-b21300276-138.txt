114 I believe that there is no organized pai-t of the human body completely destitute of nerves; by organized pai-t, I mean, no living part. The cuticle, the nails, the haiis, have not any; but these are not living structures; they ai-e merely secretions, and excrescences from living structures. The bones, peri- osteum, cartilages, tendons, and membranes, com- monly ranked amongst parts devoid of sensibility, are not wanting nerves; we cannot trace them in either of these substances; but disease proves their existence. In inflammation of bone, peri- osteum, the dura mater, pleura, and peritoneum, there would be no pain if there were no nerves; as it is, no diseases are accompanied with more agonizing pain than pleuritis, peritonitis, &c. hence nerves must be present, although minute anatomy cannot show them. It may be laid down as jjositive, that no organized part is witliout nerves; but in some struc-^ tures, they are more numerous than in others ; hence, their different degrees of sensibility. How nerves terminate is a matter of conjecture in many cases; but we well know how a few are disposed of. Thus, the olfactory nerves spread on the pituitary membrane of the nose, to give us the sense of smell; the optic expand to form the retinae; the auditoiy nerves line the walls of the labyrinth of the ears, for the sense of hearing; but how the nerves entering the viscera, muscles, &c. end, we cannot positively de- termine.

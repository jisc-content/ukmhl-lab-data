The bones which compose the skeleton, are joined together, for the most part, by ligaments; but the jimctions vary from one another in many respects; and the variations have given rise to a division of the joints into genera, and the genera are subdivided into species. The parts which enter into the composition of a joint, capable of free motion, are, ligaments, synovial membrane, synovia, and cartilage; in some of the joints, there are ligaments, as well within, as without the cavity of the joint. With a few of the articulations, there are connected some tendons: e. g. the shoulder, hip, and others; but tendons ought not to be enume- rated amongst the component parts, since their prin- cipal use is to strengthen the articulation. On laying open one of the joints of the extre- mities, the fine vascular synovial membrane appears,

17 After birth, its economy is changed, and it begins to enjoy the common functions of life. By the application of a ligature to the umbilical cord, the circulation in the umbilical vein and arteries is destroyed; these vessels consequently collapse; their sides grow together, and they become ligaments. When the child is extricated from the uterine cavity, it inspires; this act causes the pulmonary tissue to expand, and freedom is given to the circulation in its vessels. From a greater quantity of blood being thus determined to the lungs, the call for collateral routes is rendered unnecessary, and the foramen ovale, and ductus arteriosus, are by degrees obliterated;—the former by adhesion,—the latter by conversion into ligament, after the manner of the umbilical vessels. Thus, in course of time, all the peculiarities of the foetal circulating system are destroyed, and the blood takes the same round of movement, as in the adult subject. If we observe the anatomy of the foetus at birth, we shall see hoAv diiferent its hard and soft parts are, to what we find them in more advanced age. The bones are imperfectly ossified ; the joints are large and loose; the muscles pale and weak; the head dispro- portionately large; the cranial bones more numerous, and their junction less compact; the chest contracted ; the abdomen tumid from the extraordinary magnitude of the liver, and other causes. In the upper and lower extremities, there is nothing remaikablc, except D

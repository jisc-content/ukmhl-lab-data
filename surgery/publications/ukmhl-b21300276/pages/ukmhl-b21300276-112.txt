88 branes. In these organs, the ajrangement of tlie secreting apparatus is simple. The arteries terminate in two ways; in pores, and veins. The fluid secreted by the capillary vessels, exudes through the pores; and the veins return the superfluous quantity of blood. Of the second kind, are those small glandular bodies contained within the mucous membrane of the diflTerent passages; and we may class with them the sebaceous follicles; here the secretory apparatus is less simple. Between the terminations of the arteries, and the commencement of the veins, there is an arrangement of jiarts, more neai'ly approaching to that of complex glands. Of the third kind, ai*e those glands which con- stitute some of the important organs of the body; as the salivai-y glands, the liver, the pancreas, the kidiiies, the testes, and the mammae. In these organs, the parenchyma is peculiarly complicated; because the fluids which they secrete, ai'e of a compound natm-e, and some of them differing essentially from the blood. The screted fluids of the body may thus be classed, in conformity with the organs to which they respec- tively belong: A. —The fluids of the organs of loco-motion. B. —The fluids of the serous membranes of the three grand cavities. C—The fluids of the digestive organs.

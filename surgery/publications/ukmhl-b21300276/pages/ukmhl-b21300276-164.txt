The second of the five senses, is the sense of hearing; the organ is the Ear, which is divided into external, and internal parts. Hearing is a sense of great importance, as it warns us of the approach of danger, and enables us to communicate with each other; but still it is less important than that of sight. The external ear is composed of elastic cartilages, and the meatus auditorius extemus, which is a canal, partly cartilaginous, and partly bony; the cartilages are covered with common integument, and the canal is lined with the same structure, which terminates in a cul de sac, at the membrana tympani, and under which are the ceruminous glands, or the small bodies which secrete the wax of the ear. The external ear has scarcely any motion in the human subject; but in animals, it is extensively mobile. To the eminences, and depressions, formed by the external cartilages, diiferent names are given, as helix; antihelix; tragus; antitragus; fossa innominata; scapha; and concha; by these, the sound is collected, and transmitted to the membrana tympani, which is the septum between the external and internal parts of the auditor}- appa- ratus. The membrana tympani is situated at the bot- tom of the meatus auditorius, which in the foetus is a mere bony ring, but in the adult a spiral canal; the

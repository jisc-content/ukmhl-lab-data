twouty-foiir ribs, twelve on each side. The seVen uppermost; proceed to the Sternum, a bone composed of two porAons, and the cartilago ensiformis, and from being joined to this bone by means of cartilages they are called ti'ne ribs. The five inferior on each side, do not reach the sternum, and on that account are named false, or floating ribs. The dorsal vertebrae, behind; the sternum, before; and the ribs, laterally; constitute the conical cavity, called Thorax, which contains the heart, lungs, and other important parts. There are differences to be observed amongst the Ribs. Some are more curved than others; their diminution in curvature being gradual, from the first to the last. From the first to the seventh, the ribs increase in length; and from the seventh to the twelfth, they decrease. The first rib is articulated only with the first vertebra of the back. The eleventh and twelfth have no tubercles, and the last, no fossa for the intercostal vessels and nerve. The Pelvis is a cavity, formed of bone; poste- riorly is the sacrum; at its apex, the os coccygis; and on the sides, and in front, are the ossa innominata. Above, it is expanded; below that, contracted; then expanded again, to form the cavit}-; and this last ter- minates in an inferior opening, called the outlet. The pelvis contains the bladder, rectum, and other organs. Each Upper Extremity is composed of the shoulder, arm, fore-arm, and hand.

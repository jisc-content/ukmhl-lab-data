284 Some anatomical writers have described this membrane as consisting of three parts, a middle, an inferior, and a superior; but this view is objectionable, as it does not give us an exact idea of its coutiimity. The peritoneum answers two important uses, viz.â€”to retain the viscera in their situation, and to secrete a serous fluid to lubricate the surfaces of the organs, and to prevent their adhesion to each other. The secretive function of this membrane may be af- fected by the same causes as those which affect the pleura. A morbid collection of its fluid is called ascites, and may arise from inflammation, debility, or organic disease. The operation of paracentesis is justified when the accumulation is so excessive as to occasion urgent symptoms by its pressiu-e, but it has only a palliative effect when the dropsy results from visceral disease. The student will now examine the relative posi- tion of the abdominal organs; he will observe the form, the transverse position, the surfaces, the curva- tiu-es, and the extremities of the stomach; the extre- mity in which the oesophagus terminates, is called the cai-dia; that from which the intestines proceed, is named the pylorus. He will then follow the course of the intestinal canal, consisting of the duodenum, jeju- num, and ilium, or the small; and the ccecum, colon and rectum, or large intestines. The duodenum is in great measure concealed until it emerges fiom the

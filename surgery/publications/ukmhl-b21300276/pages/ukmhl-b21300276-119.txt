In the treatment of biliary disorders, our attention must be principally directed to the state of the liver; a derangement of which being, in the majority of cases, the primary cause of a morbid secretion of bile. The pancr'eatic juice is secreted by a long glan- dular body, called the pancreas, lying in the epigastric region, behind the stomach. Like the salivary glands, to which the pancreas is very analogous in structui*e, it' is composed of lobes, which are connected by cellular tissue, and the arteries terminate in two ways, viz.—in the radicles of the excretory ducts, and veins. The excretory duct terminates in the duodenum, some-

250 / and the principal of them are united anteriorly to the sterniun, by means of intervening cartilages. The student mttst examine the processes, and remarkable points in the bony parts of the thorax; he must observe how the muscles before and behind are expanded upon the ribs^ and the protection thus aifoi'ded against fractures, and how they may affect the walls of the chest, when their insertions are fixed. BetAveen the ribs he will find the two layers of inter- costal muscles; and there are other muscles, with the uses of which he must make hiinself acquainted. On noticing the ribs in their mode of junction^ with the sternum, with the vertebrae, and with each other, it must be evident that in case of fractiu'e, the broken extremities can oiily be displaced inwards, or outwards; their connection, before and behind, prevents any derangement in length; and the fragments cannot be carried either upwards, or downwai-ds, on account of the intercostal muscuku- fibres acting equally above, and below the extiemities of the broken bone. 'rhe thoracic cdvity is shut oUt from the.neck^ by the muscles and blood-vessels going to, and returning firom the neck, head, and upper extremities; and below, from the abdomen, by the diaphragm. Having raised the sternum and cartilages of the ribs, we obtain a view of the viscera of the chest, invested by their pleuritic membrane. Inclined to the left, from a

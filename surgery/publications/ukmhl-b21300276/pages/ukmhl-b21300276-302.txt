276 ensiforinis to llie junction of the pubcs, and then another from tlie umbilicus obliquely upwards and outwards, over the cartilages of the ribs; this last incision is in the direction of the fibres of the obliquus exteruus ab- dominis. This last muscle is to be carefully dissected in the course of its fibres, and the student will find that they run inwards and downwards to terminate in an ex- panded tendon, or aponeurosis, the attachments of which towards the iliac, and pubic regions, must be par- ticularly attended to. The first attachment to be noticed, is that of the aponeurosis to the anterior superior spi- nous process of the ilium; from this point, the tendon is extended to the inner extremity of the pubis of the same side, and to that of the opposite bone, forming Poupart's ligament; and here, the tendinous fibres separate, so as to leave a triangular apertiu'e, which is called the external abdominal ring. The other implan- tation of this muscle, which forms Gimberrat's liga- ment, Avill be mentioned when we enter on the particular anatomy of herniai. We have said, that the muscles of one side of the abdomen meet those on the other, at the linea alba; this line, therefore, is another point into which the external oblique muscle is inserted. Having reflected the integumens, and exposed the whole of the obliquus extenius, the student must observe the umbilicus, the linea alba, the lineae semi- lunares, and lineae transversales. The umbilicus, now and then, yields so as to cause visceral protrusion. The linea alba is formed by the interlacement of the apo-

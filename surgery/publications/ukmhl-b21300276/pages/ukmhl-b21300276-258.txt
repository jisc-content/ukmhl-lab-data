' 234 lower and middle reg-ions of the neck, the student will pursue the course of the artery towards the angle of the jaw, where it usually divides into two considerable branches, the internal, and external carotids; the internal enters the foramen carotidum, to supply the anterior part of the brain; the external furnishes branches to the neck, face, and scalp. With respect to the place where the division of the common carotid takes place, it now and then varies, but generally it is said to divide opposite to the upper margin of the thyroid caitilage, a transverse line then drawn from this point, will be our guide to the seat of bifurcation. Before tracing the external carotid, and the branches which arise from it, the following parts of the basis of the jaw must be sought for: the inferior portion of the parotid gland; the digastiicus, and the muscles which take their origin from the styloid pro- cess of the temporal bone; the submaxillary gland; absorbent glands; the mylo hyoideus; the hyog-lossus, and the other muscles of the tongue; the sublingual gland; and the ducts of the salivary glands. The stu- dent is next to follow the nerves of this part, viz.â€”the glosso pharyngeal, the lingual, the nervus accesso- rius Willisii, &c.; and deeper seated, he will find the par vagum, and great sympathetic emerging from the cranium. The relative position of the external and internal carotids, with regard to each other, and to the

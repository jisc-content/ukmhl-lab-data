The upper part or dorsum is covered over with the small eminences called papillse; the venter is partially con- fined by a doubling of the lining membrane, named the fraenum lingilae, the relation of which, to the blood- vessels of the tongue should be observed, as they arc in danger of being cut, in carelessly clipping it in tongue-tied children; near the fraenum will be found the terminations of the submaxillary and sublingual ducts, an obstruction of which is the cause of ranula. t The anterior cavity of the mouth is separated from the posterior, by the velmn pendulum palati. It is a musculai- curtain consisting of two arches, with a thick pendulous body in the centre, named the uvula. Laterally each arch has two pillars, between which is the amygdala or tonsil gland, which secretes a mucus. Inflammation of the tonsil gland is named cy- nanche tonsillaiis, but often the inflammatory action is extended to the neighboming parts.

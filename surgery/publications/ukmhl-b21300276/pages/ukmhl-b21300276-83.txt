50 due iiiid regular execution of its I'uncliou; hence, a dilFereuce is made in the thickness of the parietes of the difterent cavities of the heart. The right, and left auricles have tliin musculai- walls; but they possess a sufficient degree of power for the purpose required, viz. —that of sending the blood into the right and left ven- tricles, wliich ai-e close at hand. The parietes of the right ventricle are more slender than those of the left; because less force of contractility is demanded, to trans- mit the blood through the lungs than to propel it, (as the left ventricle does in great measure), throughout the arterial system. Within the cavities of the heart, the student should observe the cai'ueae column£E, and chordgp tendineae, An examination of the structures of the cavities of this organ, will assist us in explaining how the sides of each of them are approximated; how the blood is expell- ed; and how a retrogade course of this fluid is guarded against. The course of the blood is determined by the mechanism of the valves; the valves being flood-gates, which permit the passage of the blood in one direction only. They are thus named: the valve between the vena cava inferior, and the right auricle, is called, the valvula Eustachii; that, at the termination of the coronary vein, the valvula semilunaris; that, between the right auricle, and right ventricle, the tricuspid valve. The three valves at the root of the pulmo- nary- artery, are named, from their figure, the valvule serailunarcs. Between the pulmonary veins, and the left auricle, there are no valves. Between the

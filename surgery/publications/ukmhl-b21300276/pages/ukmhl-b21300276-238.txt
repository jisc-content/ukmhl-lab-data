214 and still seldomer dislocated. In these accidents, the danger is in proportion to the concussion or compres- sion which the spinal marrow suffers. A case of fracture of the processus dentatus is mentioned in Sir Astley Cooper's Work on Fractures and Dislocations. A woman, in the venereal ward of St. Thomas' Hospital, while sitting in bed, eating her dinner, was observed to fall suddenly forwaids, and, upon the patients running to her, she was found dead. On examination, it was discovered that the dentiform process had been broken off; and the head, in falling forwards, had forced the root of the process back upon the spinal marrow, which had occasioned her instant dissolution. A dislocation fi-om rupture of the transverse ligament (if the dislocation were complete) would prove fatal in the same way. Luxation from any other cause is scarcely possible, but should it occur, the effects would be according to the seat of accident. If the second vertebra were dislocated from the third, death would almost immediately ensue, if the pressure on the spinal marrow were considerable, for the phrenic nerves would become paralyzed, and respiration thereby stopt; but if below the fourth cer- vical vertebra, it is possible for the patient to survive; the parts below the injury would, however, lose sen- sation and voluntary motion. Fractures of the vertebra; are, fortunately, very rare occurrences; and, imfortunately, when exten- sive, they seldom admit of any relief.

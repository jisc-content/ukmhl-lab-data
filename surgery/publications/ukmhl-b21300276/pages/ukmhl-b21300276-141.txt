117 a. —Superior cervical Gang-lion. b. —Middle Cervical Ganglion. c. —Inferior Cervical Ganglion. 2— Thoracic Ganglia, from which the splanchnic hranchcs arise. 3— Lumbar Ganglia. 4— Sacral Ganglia. In the abdomen, near the trmik of the cceliac ar- tery, we see the semilunar ganglion. Between the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries, are several small gan- glia, named the cceliac ganglia. Near this part, we find unmerous nervous filaments, crossing and re-cross- ing each other, and forming a complicated net work, which has been called the solar plexus; from this point, branches go off to the principal viscera of the abdomen and pelvis, and each set of branches is termed a plexus; thus, we have the hepatic plexus; the splenic plexus; the superior mesenteric plexus; the renal, or emulgent plexus; the spermatic plexus; the inferior mesenteric plexus; and the hypogastric plexus. There is scarcely a part in the body, that may not be drawn into a sympathetic consent \vith this diffused and beautiful system of nerves. Its junctions, by means of ganglia, with the cerebral, and spinal nerves, oflFer an easy solution of this fact. The nerves wliich go off f rom the spinal marrow, are thirty-one pairs, and divided into nine cervical;

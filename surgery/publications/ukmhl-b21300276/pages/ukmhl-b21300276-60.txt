36 The shoulder consists of the clavicula, ami scapula. The arm, of the os humeri. The fore-arm, of the radius, and ulna. The hand of the bones of the carpus, raeta-carpns, and fing'ers. Each Lower Extremity is composed of the thigh, leg, and foot. The thigh has one bone, the femur; the leg, two bones, the tibia and fibula, Avith an appendage to the former, called patella; and the bones of the foot are those of the tarsus, metatarsus, and toes. Having learnt the individual bones, their pro- cesses, and remarkable points, it behoves the student to observe them in their united state, as forming the skeleton. The head, trunk, and extremities, must be examined anatomically, and physiologically. The differences to be observed in skeletons of different ages, prior to the period when ossification is complete, depend on the stage of the ossifying process. When complete, we remark peculiarities in the male and female skeleton. The male skeleton is larger, in a general way, than the female, and the bones are fuller, and more substantial; but the most striking circumstances between the two, are presented in the breadth of the shoulders in the one; and the expanded and capacious state of the pelvis, in the other. Amongst the purposes to which the skeleton is subservient, the following are the most important.

34 absorb, an excessive growth, and a tendency to effusion, will be induced. When the exhalations in the different circumscribed cavities, and cellular mem- brane, are greater than the power of the lymphatics can overcome, dropsical accumulations must take place; producing, in the head, hydrocephalus; in the chest, hydrothorax; in the abdomen, ascites; and in the cellular membrane, anasarca. The preceding remarks will serve to illustrate the uses of the absorbent system, in preventing a preternatural increase of solids, or fluids; thereby in averting disease, and modelling the growth of the body. But the absorbent system is an efficient means, in the hands of the Physician, and Surgeon, as it can be made subservient to the cure of disease. The lacteals are the most limitied part of this system; their use is, to transmit the chyle from the intestines to the thoracic duct. The lymphatics, constituting the major pai^t, arise from three sources, viz.â€”the external surface of the body, and cellular membrane under the skin; fi-om the different cavities, as the head, thorax, abdo- men, and pelvis; and from the surfaces and substance of all the organs of the body. We know the property, which mercury, and some other medicines, possess, of augmenting the action of the internal absorbents; hence, we employ these remedies in many diseases; but we can best excite the energy of the lymphatics, by administering medicine through the medium of cutaneous friction. The surface ol the body is

171 points; the latter indicates the place where the cere- brum ends, and the cerebellum begins; also where the longitudinal sums of the dm-a mater bifuscates, or divides into the two lateral sinuses. In the superior surface, we see a part of the os frontis; the parietal bones; and the sagittal suture, nmning in the same line as the longitudinal sinus. In the inferior surface, we remark the basis of the lower jaw; the palatum durum, and its foramina; the under part of the zygomatic processes; the cavities which receive the cordyles of the inferior maxilla; the depressions anterior to them, where the condyles lie in dislocation of this bone; the pterygoid processes of the sphcenoid bone; the mastoid, and styloid processes of the temporal bones; the cuneiform process of the OS occipitis; the condyloid process of the same bone; the foramen magnum for transmitting the spinal mar- row, and other parts; and behind this, are depressions, and lidges in the os occipitis, for the attachment of muscles. A great number of foramina, and pits, may be remarked in this view ; the former, for the passage of blood-vessels, and nerves, to and from the brain; the latter, for lodging soft parts. The foramina to be seen in the inferior surface are, the foramina lacera orbitalia superiora; foramina

5 Anatomy is the science of Organization; the means of learning it ai-e Dissection and Observation; and these must go hand in hand. If our knowledge of man were limited to his exterior, the healing art would experience almost as little improvement from the Study, as if Avc viewed an automaton, to which motion and gesture were given by concealed mechanical contri- vances. It is the province of Dissection to develope the secret springs of action, and to discover the organs which support life, it is therefore the foundation of Physiology; and as an acquaintance with the natural structure, arrangement of structure, and the functions of structure, is necessary to enable us to detect dis- eased structure, and diseased functions of structure, it must follow, that Anatomy and Physiology are the basis of Pathology. How incongruous and absurd would it be to suppose, that a man could discover an inaccuracy in the movements of a watch without know- ing the proper arrangement of parts in that interesting piece of mechanism; or that he could rectify the im- paired machinery of a steam-engine, if ignorant of the adaptation of the parts on which the operations of that master-piece of human ingenuity depend. Not more so than either, Avould it be to believe, that the Physician or Surgeon could repair the morbid conditions of the body, without a previous knowledge of the circum- stances by which the healthy state of its functions is maintained. It is an opinion far too prevalent, that Anatomy

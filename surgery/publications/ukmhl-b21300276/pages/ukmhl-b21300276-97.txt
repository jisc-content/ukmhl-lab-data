73 accortling- to the other, it is matter itself ; to the hitter opinion, most philosophers of the present day incline; they designate it, therefore, caloric, or the matter of heat. When we speak of heat, in common language, we intend to convey the idea of any thing, which, on coming in contact with the hand, or any part of the body, imparts the sensation of warmth; this is tempe- rature, or sensible heat; but there is another state, in which caloric may exist, and as the presence of it cannot be detected by the sense of touch, or the ther- mometer, chemists have applied to it the name of latent heat; but for further information on this sub- ject, I shall refer the student to Works on Chemisti-y. The caloric, then, which is set at liberty from the oxygen, is in a latent form; but it is disengaged in a sensible state, in the circulation, owing to the blood, on becoming venous, having a less capacity for heat, than when it was arterial. Animal heat, therefore, accord- ing to this theory, is the result of a chemical process; but some Physiologists contend, that the nervous system is concerned in its production: thus Mr. Brodie states, that if the brain be destroyed, the power of generating heat is destroyed; and Dr. Wilson Phillips has shown that the temperature of animals is consi- derably influenced by the spinal marrow. It will appear from the preceding observations, that the oxygen of the atmospheric air is diminished

66 and ventricle; the ventricle opens into a Oj. pedicle, from which the branchial, or arterv of the gills, takes its origin. The blood, after circnlating through the minute vessels of the gills, arrives at the aorta; and by this main trunk aftd its branches, it is sent to the dilierent parts of the body; here, therefore, it is scarcely possible for the heart to communicate its impulse to the general arterial system. It is in the muscular and elastic coats of arteries, that the power resides, which assists in propelling the blood onwards. The veins, too, have an inherent principle of action; less in degi'ee, however, than that of the arteries; but as the blood in them is supported by valves, less suffices. In the arteries, and veins, there is always a column of blood, which is forced forwards by the action of the heart, aided by that of the arteries, and veins. The capacity of this column is sometimes small and sometimes great; the diminution and increase con'esponding with the diastole and systole of the left venti-icle, from which circumstaiices are chiefly derived the phenomena of the pulse. The Pulse is the effect of the action of the heart upon the blood; which action causes an elonga- tion, as well as a dilatation of the artery in which the pulse is felt. The pulsations at the wist do not take place at the same moment of time, as those of the carotid, and other arteries near the heart; the interval is long, or short, in proportion to the

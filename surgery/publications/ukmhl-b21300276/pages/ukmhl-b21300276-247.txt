223 The student must next observe the external jugu- lar vein, which is formed by the union of the bj-auches from the temple, face, and neck; and descends be- hind the platysma myoides, to the subclavian vein. At or near the angle of the jaw, this vessel anasto- moses by means of two or more branches with the inter- nal jugular ; one of the vessels which retui-n the blood from the brain. The external jugular is frequently opened for the purpose of abstracting blood, and with more advantage in diseases of the head, and in oph- thalmia than a vein in the arm; indeed it is probable, with more advantage even than the temporal artery, as the depletion is more local and more immediate in its effects. When we di*aw blood from a vein of the arm, the flow affects the head, in common with the other parts of the body. When we deplete from the temporal artery, we take away that blood which was destined to supply the integuments of Ihe head; and although betsveen the vessels of the scalp and pericranium, and those of the dura mater, there are vascular communi- cations, they are only few in number. But the blood drawn fifom the external jugular vein is derived directly from the exterior of the head, and indii-ectly from the brain, through the medium of the inoscula- tions between the external and internal jugulars, near the angle of the jaw; and besides, from the discharge of blood being sudden, syncope is more speedily induced; and this is a great desideratum in certain

343 part's ligament, to tlie lower extremity. It sends off the epigastric, and the circumflexa ilii branches. After appearing at the upper part of the thigh, it takes the name of femoral artery; and passes down, obliquely, over the jjectinaeus, and triceps muscles; lower down, it corresponds with the inner edge of the sartorius muscle. After perforating the tendon of the triceps, it becomes the popliteal artery, which terminates by dividing into the anterior and posterior tibial branches. The anterior tibial perforates the interosseous ligament, and then appears in front of the leg, between the tibialis anticus, and extensor long«s digitorum; still lower, it has the extensor proprius pollicis on its outer side; and on the dorsum of the foot, it is situated between the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and the first tendon of the extensor longus digitorum. The posterior tibial branch descends between the gastrocnemius internus, and the flexor longus digi- tonun muscles. It passes behind the malleolus inter- nus, and enters the sole of the foot, where it divides into the plantar arteries. The peroneal ai'tery is a branch of the posterior tibial, and ends by anasto- mosing with branches of the anterior and posterior tibial, near the ankle-joint. The arteries are accompanied by veins; below, the knee, there are two veins to one ai'tery; but above the knee, only one. The vente saphenie ai"e cutaneous «

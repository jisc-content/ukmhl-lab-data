122 (heir function being- dependent on tlie communication which exists between their nerves and the hrain. Tlic organ of vision is the Eye, consisting of parts which admit of being divided into appendages, and globe; the former aie accessaiy to the function of the eye; the latter is composed of coats, and humours, which serve to refract the rays of light, and other purposes. The appendages of the eye are the supercilia, or eye-brows; the palpebra?, or lids; the cilia, or lashes; the tarsi, or cartilaginous edges of the lids; the meibo- mian glands; the tunica conjunctiva; the lachrymal apparatus; and muscles. The eye-brows moderate light, which, if intense, confuses vision. The lids are subservient to the same use, and, by the motion of the palpebra superior, the tears ai-e difiiised over the surface of the eye. The lashes guard the eye in some measure, against the entrance of foreign bodies; but they likewise lessen the intensity of the light; and M<n-gagni believed, that persons with black eye-lashes have greater strength of sight, than those with white. The tarsi, when the lids are closed, form a canal, by which the tears arc conducted to the puncta lachry- malia. The meibomian glands, which are very con- spicuous in the ox, and large animals, secrete a yellow ihiid, which moistens the lashes, and prevents the agglutination of the lids during sleep. The timica conjunctiva gives a covering' to the anterior surface

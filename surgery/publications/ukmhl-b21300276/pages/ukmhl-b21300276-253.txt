229 tamoiir, a circumstance indicated by pain on pressure/ it would be rash and dangerous to employ it. The cure, in this way, must at all times be an exceedingly tardy and wearisome process ; but it is justifiable in certain cases to try its eiFect. When acting in a pro- per manner, it gives no pain, and cures by diverting the current of the circulation from the aneurismal -sac. Prior to the year 1785, (a period which should be kept in remembrance from having given birth to a most important improvement in operative surgei-y) tiie operation for aneurism was pregnant with difficulty and danger, so that Mr. Pott and otliers declared, that imtil a better mode of treating the disease was discov- ered, amputation was the only resource in popliteal aneurism. The operation consisted in cutting open the tumour, cleaning it of its contents, and tying the artery at each extremity of the sac. We are told that this method was fii*st adopted by Severinus and Trul- lus, about the year 1646, in a case of aneurism in the thigh ; and subsequently to them by many surgeons in France, Germany, and Italy. The first operation of the kind performed in this country, at least the first on record, occurred to Mr. Burchall, at the Manches- ter Infirmary, in 1757; an accoimt of which, will be found in the third volume of " Medical Observations and Inquiries.''^ The frequent failure caused it to fall into disuse, and amputation of the limb was sub- stituted, until John Hunter's improvement superseded the necessity of so desperate an expedient. 1

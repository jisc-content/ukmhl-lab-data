.358 ner in which the upper part of the thigh is shut out from the ahdomen. By turning down the abdominal muscles, and peritoneum, and passing the finger under Poupart's ligament, he will find what is called the crural opening, which gives passage to the arterj-, and vein of the groin. The opening is not free, except at the inner side of the vein, which is the part at which the jirotrusion takes place in femoral hernia. The crural opening, or ring, is bounded, above, by Poupart's ligament, which is here called, the crural arch; on the inner, or pubic side, by the ligament of Gimbernat, which presents to the finger, a sharp edge; on the outer, or iliac side, and behind, by the psoas magnus, and the iliacus muscles, and the fascia which covers them. The artery and vein are inclosed in a funnel-like sheath, which is formed, on the fore part, by the fascia transversalis; and on the back part, by the fascia iliaca, the membrane just mentioned as giving a covering to the psoas magnus, and iliacus internus muscles. The artery is on the iliac, and the vein on the pubic side of the crural ring. In femoral hernia, as in inguinal, the peritoneum forms the sac; of which fact, the student may easily convince himself by separating the peritoneum from the inner sur- face of the abdominal muscles, and examining the manner in which it passes over the ring: then he will find, that no viscus can enter the crural ring without carrying the peritoneum with it. If this membrane be

43 tendency to slough, or mortify, on being wounded, puncturedj or otherwise injured. Muscles are exqui- sitely sensible; tendons, on the other hand, are almost devoid of this faculty; they may be cut, or torn, with- out the animal expressing the slightest degree of pain. Muscle, and tendon, therefore, are not the same, but very different sti-uctures. The principle of muscular motion is irritabilityy of the nature of which, we know as little as we do of life; but there are certain laws of this principle, which we may consider as established; thus, experiments, and observation, fully prove that a muscle cannot long remain in a state of action; therefore, firstly, a state of rest must succeed a state of action. Secondly; every irritable part loses a portion of its irritability by action. Thirdly; by repose, it regains the portion which it lost. Fourthly; all irritable parts are not endowed with the same share of irritability. The heart is the most irritable of all animal structures; next, the intestines; the stomach; the urinary bladder; the muscles of respiration; the voluntary muscles; the arteries; the veins; and lastly, the absorbents. Fifthly; the degree of action produced by a stimulus, is (caeteris i)aribus) in proportion to the power of the stimulus. And Sixthly; the action of every stimulus is in an inverse ratio to the frequency of its appli- cation. There are other confirmed laws of this extra- ordinary principle; bnt the six above mentioned, are most familiar to us; as facts, illustrative of them, are

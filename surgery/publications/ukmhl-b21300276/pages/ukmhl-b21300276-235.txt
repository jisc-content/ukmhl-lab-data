211 euteriug the larynx: these observations must be remembered. To distend the lungs from the nostrils, it is not absolutely necessary that the tube should be insinuated into the aperture of the larynx. We may not always have a projjer instrument at hand, and as what is to be done in suspended animation, must be done quickly, another method of operating must be employed. If we were to introduce a tube, or the nozzle of a pair of bellows into one of the nosti-ils, and blow; it is evi- dent that the air would not pass into the trachea, as the epiglottis closes the opening into it, and that some would escape through the mouth, some through the nostril, and some pass into the stomach; to prevent these causes of failure, a finger must be put into the mouth, and the tongue drawn forwards, by this the epiglottis will be raised, and by approximating the lips around the finger, the air will be prevented from escaping per os; the opposite nostril to that occu- pied by the tube must be closed; and the fingers of an assistant must press back the thyroid cartilage upon the CESophagus, so that air may not pass into the stomach; there is now only one passage for the air, and that is into the lungs. Respiration is partly a mechanical process; the parietes of the chest dilate, and the lungs become distended by the pressure of the atmosphere; this is inspiration: the parietes then fall, and by pressing the lungs, the air is expelled; this is expiration. These operations by the natural powers.

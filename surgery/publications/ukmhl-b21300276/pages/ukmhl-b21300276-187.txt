ON RELATIVE position; OR MEDICO-CHIRURGICAL VIEWS OF THE HUMAN BODY. After the general description of the human body, which has been given in strict physiological order, it is proper to consider the grouping together of parts; and thus to describe their support and connexions. This constitutes the study of Relative Position; a knowledsre which enables us to detect the seat of dis- ease, and which has an influence on all the steps that are taken, in the planning and performance of the different operations of surgery. We have seen that there are different systems of parts in the human body; but to study them sepai-ately, is only admissible, as introductory to other important points; afterwards, the student must observe the rela- tions which they have to each other, and the manner in which they are linked together; for it is principally by observation on them in their united state, that he wUl acquire a competency to practice his profession with success and safety.

G. —The fluids of the organs of the five senses. H. —The fluids of the organs of re-production, I. —The fluids of the connecting media. A.—The organs of loco-motion are the bones^ joints, and muscles. In the bones, we find an oily substance, which is called marrow; it is secreted by the membrana medul- laris, or that vascular membrane which lines the can-r cellated stiucture of bone. On analysis, it is found to consist of pure man*ow, albumen, gelatin, a peculiar extractive matter, and water. In the moveable articulations, we find the capsu- lar ligament lined by a very delicate membrane of extreme vascularity, and called the synovial mem< brane. It secretes the synovia^ which lubricates the articulatory surfaces. Synovia is composed of albu- men, gelatin, mucilage, water, and a small quantity of the muiiate of soda. With the tendons of certain muscles, there are connected bursse mucosse. They are fiimished with a synovial membrane for secreting a fluid,

118 twelve dorsal; five lumbar; and five sacral. The cer- vical nerves are, 1—Nervus Accessorius Willisii, 2 Suboccipitalis, 3- Cervicalis Primus, 4 Secundus, 5 Tertius. The above nerves aie chiefly distributed to muscles. The fourth, third, and sometimes the second cer- vical nerves, send off filaments to form the phi-enic, or diajjliragmatic nerves. The sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cervical, and first dorsal, which are much larg'cr than the prece- ding spinal nerves, unite to form the axillary plexus. From the axillary plexus, arise the nei-ves that supply the upper extremity, viz.— 1— Thoracici, 2— Scapularis, 3— Articularis, 4— Cutancus Intenius, 5 Minor, 6 Externus, vel Musculo Cutaneus, 7— Spii'alis, 8— Medianus, 9— Ulnaris.

186 the masseter and buccinator muscles. It will be seen passing over the belly of the fonner muscle, and pene- trating the latter, to enter the mouth, just opposite to the space between the second and third molares of the upper jaw. He may trace the duct to the parotid gland, an exensive body situated before the ear, and the principal salivary gland. Its connections with blood-vessels and nerves, are exceedingly important, and should be well studied. Another point of practice i& the knowledge that one or more conglobate glands are usually found situated near the parotid, and that a disease of them may be confounded with a disease of the pai'otid itself. The duct of the parotid is formed by numerous twigs, which arise from the granules of the gland; it tends forwai"ds fi-om its origin, and its coui'se across the cheek is defined by a line di-awn from the junction of the lobe and pinna of the ear, to a little above the angle of the mouth. The duct is embedded in fat, and absorbent glands; on removing which, the student will expose some small twigs of the portio dm-a nerve, and the transversalis faciei arteiy. It is of great conse- quence, tliat the coui'se of the parotid duct should be known ; because mischief will arise from an injury of it, either in the removal of tumours fi-om the face, or in wounds from other causes. The mischief to be apprehended, is the formation of a salivary fistula. We have followed the parotid duct (called ductus

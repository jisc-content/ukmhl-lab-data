94 Very many serious diseases owe their existence to a deranged state of the biliary secretion. It may be in a deficient quantity, when the functions of digestion and defaecation will suifer; or may be in excess, as in yellow fever, and in that fatal disease called, cholera morbus; but in these disorders, it is acrid in property, as well as redundant in quantity. The bile may be prevented from passing into the intestines, in which case it will become absorbed, and by entering into the mass of blood, produce jaimdice. The obstruction may be temporary, from the pressure on the ducts by surrounding viscera, as in jaundice from pregnancy; but it is more lasting often in cases of obstruction from a biliary calculus. Biliary calculi are not unfrequently found in the gall-bladder, without giving any signs of their existence during life; but if one, or more, should pass into the ducts, very painful and dangerous consequences may follow. BUiary concretions are proposed to be arranged under four classes. In the first class, is that kind of gall-stone which has a white colour, and a chrystallized, shining, lami- nated structure; it is soluble in oil of tui-pentine, and pure alkalies; and of an oval form. 2dly.â€”That kind which is polygonal, or round in its formation, and of a light greyish brown coloui". f

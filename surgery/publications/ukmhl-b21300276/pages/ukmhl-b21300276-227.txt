On TijE Mouth.â€”In the anatomy of the mouth, I shall comprehend .the space situated before, and that situated behind the cuitain of the palate; the former cavity is the mouth, commonly so called; the latter is usually named the fauces, or top of the throat. I shall call them anterior, and posterior cavities of the mouth. The boundaiies of the anterior cavity when the jaw-bones are closed, are these; the roof is formed by the palatum durum; the floor by the tongue, and its connections; the anterior and lateral parts, by the alveolar processes, teeth, and gums; and the posterior part by the velum pendulum palati, vel palatum moUe. All these parts (the alveolar processes and teeth excepted) are covered by the lining membrane of the mouth, which is similar in structui'e to the common integument; this is proved by its being occasionally aifected with the same specific eruptions as the skin. In order to gain a distinct Adew of the anterior cavity of the mouth, the student should make an in- cision from each angle of the lips, towards the articu- lations of the lower jaw, then by separating the two jaws; the tongue and its connections, and the soft palate will be fully exposed.

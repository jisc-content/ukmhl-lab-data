G3 the internal principally supplies the pelvic viscera; the external pusses under Poupait's ligament, to the lower extiemity. This is a general idea of the distri- bution of the aiterial system. The arteries tei-minate in six ways, viz.—in anastomosing with other branches; in veins; in the excretoiy ducts of glands; in exhalent vessels; in cells; and in colourless, or serous branches* In their comse, fiom their origin to their terminations, some branches pass off from the trunks, at acute angles; others more obtusely. After making their angles, and flexions, they rmi, for the most part, in a straight direction; with the exception of such arteries as supply parts which are subject to be stretched, or where a contrivance is necessary, in order to break the force of circulation; thus, in the lips, uterus, and brain, they take a tortuous, or serpentine course. An artery is a tube composed of coats; which coats have vasa vasorum, lymphatics, and nerves. They are three in nimaber, and named, the cellular, or elastic, the muscular, and the membranous. It is to the first coat, that an artery owes its ability to retain a cylindrical form, when cut across. The Veins are those vessels which return the blood of the arteries back again to the heart. They arise from two sources, viz.—from the extreniities of arteries, and from cells; and terminate in the auricles of the heart. The veins of the head, neck, and upper

38 bedewed with its synovia, or secretion; it is classed amongst the most vascular structures of the body, for by coloured size injection, it can be rendered uniformly red. The arteries Avhich are distributed to it, termi- nate in two ways, viz.â€”in veins, and exhalents; the former to return the superfluous quantity of blood, the latter for the synovial secretion. The use of the synovia is to lubricate the articulating suifaces, for facilitating their motion upon each other. Besides the synovial membrane, we find the cartilages which tip the extremities of the bones of the joint; they are smooth, white, and extremely elastic; not very vascular, hence endowed only with a weak living principle. Within the knee-joint, there are ligaments, connecting the heads of the bones; but the knee and hip are the only articulations which are fmiiished with internal ligaments. Without, or on the exterior of the joint, how - ever, there is always one, or more ligaments; when only one (a capsular), the deficiency is made up for, by means, which additionally strengthen this ligament; thus, in the shoulder, and hip-joints, the expanded tendons of muscles contribute much to increase the strength of the capsular ligament; but in the latter, Mye find the ligamentum teres, in addition to that circumstance; and in the former, the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle runs through the cavity of the joint. The ligaments, like the cartilages, are but (spa- ringly organised.

102 ventricles from falling together. When collected in large quantity, it forms hydrocephalus internus. In the sheaths of the nerves, there is an aqueous humour, which serves to keep the nervous fibrils moist, &c. G.â€”We may divide the fluids of tJie eye, into those of the appendages, and those situated in the interior of the organ. The tears, and meibomian fluid, are secretions of the first division; the aqueous humour, the lens, the vitreous humour, and the pig- mentum nigrum, of the second. The tears are formed by the lachrymal glands; one in each eye. The gland occupies a depression in the upper, and outer part of the orbit. There proceed from it, six or seven small ducts, which open on the inner side of the upper eye-lid. After being diflHised over the surface of the eye, to moisten it, and to obviate the effects of attiition from the motion of the eye-lids, the tears are conveyed to the puncta lachry- malia into the lachrymal sac, and from thence to the nose. The tears contain, mucus, water, and a small quantity of saline matter. Between the tarsi, and lining membrane of the eye-lids, the meibomian follicles are seen. The secretion from them is of an oily nature, and prevents the accretion of the eyelids during sleep.

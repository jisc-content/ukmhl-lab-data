40 of reparation in the body, viz.â€”adhesion, and granu- lation. What then have we to expect? A tedious case; the cartilaginous surfaces must first become absorbed, because they are almost incapable of granu- lating, in consequence of their feeble living powers; and whilst this is going on, the constitutional irritation is often excessive. Sometimes an apparently trifling injury is followed by the most serious consequences; frequently such as endanger the limb, and not unfre- quently, the life of the patient, unless amputation is timely resorted to; thus we are convinced of the necessity, imperatively called for, of not neglecting at the onset, wounds of joints. We must employ such means as are most likely to bring about an adhesion of the divided surfaces, and to keep down inflammation; for if these indications be neglected, the second mode of reparation wUl be attempted, at the expence of great local, and constitutional distress. These remarks I have deemed useful, as illustrative of the association between the Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology, of the articulating system. No further observations can be required on the morbid phenomena of joints; because, a right under- standing of what we have afready stated, Avill be the key to an explanation of inflammation, and its conse- quences from most causes; and of the danger resulting from fractures extending into, and compound dislo- cations of, joints. But in order to be profited by Anatomy, in learning the dislocations, it is necessary

143 In the tympanum, there are four opening's; one leads to the throat, and is called the Eustachian tube; another communicates with the mastoid cells ; a third, the fenestra ovalis, leads to the vestibule; and a fourth, the fenestra rotunda, opens into the cochlea of the labyrinth. There is no aperture of communi- cation between the tympanum and the semi-circular canals; but between them and the vestibule, openings exist. Besides the bones, muscles, and foramina, a nerve is seen, called, the chorda tympani, and there are two or more irregular elevations. The next part of the internal ear is the labyrinth ; which is divided into vestibule, cochlea, and semi- circular canals. These windings, and sinuosities, are filled with water, and on their parietes, is spread the pulp of the auditory nei-ve. This is the arrangement of the parts which enter into the composition of the ear; but to understand the Physiology of this organ, the student must have a general knowledge of the principles of Acoustics. Sound is an effect produced by the concussion of elastic bodies ; the common medium of it is air j but there are two other media of conveyance, viz.â€” solid bodies, and water. In the ear, we have an example of each of them; thus, air conveys the sono- rous rays to the membrana tympani; the chain of bones carries them across the cavity of the drum; and

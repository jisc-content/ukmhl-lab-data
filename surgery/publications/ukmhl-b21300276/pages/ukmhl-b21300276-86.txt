62 ai-tery and its raniificatious; iuid llie radicles and trunks of llie i)ulmonary veins: those connected witli tlie latter are, the left aimcle, and ventricle; the arteries; and the veins. The Arteries are the vessels, wliich convey the blood from the heart, to the different structures of the body. They originate in two main trunks, viz.â€” the pulmonary artery, and aorta; the pulmonary artery arises from the right ventricle of the heart, and is distributed to the lungs ; the aorta springs from the left ventiiele, divides, and subdivides, into branches, which go to all the other organized jjarts of the body. After its origin, the aorta gives off the coronary arteries, and then forms a ciu*vature, or arch, from which part, vessels jiass off' to the neck, head, and upper extremities. It then descends on the left of the spine; and whilst in the chest, sends off* the intercostal, oesophageal, and bronchial branches. After emerging from the thorax, it be- gins to supply the abdominal viscera; some of its branches are azygous, or single; others are in pairs. The single branches are, the caeliac, the superior and inferior mesenteric, which are distributed to the stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, and intestines. The double branches are, the diaphragmatic, the renal, the spermatic, and the lumbar. At the fourth, or fifth lumbar vertebra, the aorta bifurcates into the common iliac arteries. Each common iliac divide's into an internal and external branch;

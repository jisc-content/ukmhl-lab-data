45 From the constant actions, consequent on organi- sation and life, and from the continual losses thereby sustained, the body would soon operate its own destruction, if it were not provided with an apparatus to receive the aliment, and to convert the same into a substance capable of repairing the wastes, and of suppoi-ting the functions necessary to life. The organs concerned in this important office ai-e called the Diges- tive Organs; they are, the teeth, salivary glands, oesophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, spleei^, lacteals, mesenteric glands, and thoracic duct. The Teeth are the organs of mastication, and, in the adult, thirty-two in nmhber. They are usually divided into four classes, viz.â€”the incisores, four in each jaw; the canini, two in each jaw; the bicus- jndati, foui- in each jaw; and the molares, six in each jaw.

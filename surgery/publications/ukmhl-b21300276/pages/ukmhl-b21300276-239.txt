215 There is no pai-t of Anatomy more neglected by- students, than that of the muscles of the spine ; but as the attention of the Profession has recently been much attracted to it by some improvements in the treatment of curvatures, founded on anatomical and physiological knowledge, it will, we doubt not, now receive that share of investigation to which it is entitled. Incurvations of the vertebral column have, at all times, much engaged the thoughts of practitioners, and numerous works have been written upon the subject; of late, they have multiplied fast upon us; but I agree with a modern reviewer, that our know- ledge of the causes, and remedies, has not increased in the same ratio as the authors; still we must admit, that there appears the dawn of probability, that the treatment of diseased conditions of the spine is more likely than ever, to be placed on a scientific basis, and for this we are indebted to the judicious applica- tion of Anatomy and Physiology to the science of Pathology. On observing the attachments of the muscles of the spine, the student will learn, that their conjoint actions are, to maintain the equilibrium of the trunk, and thus perpendicularly to support the superincum- bent weight; and that when the muscles on one side act independently of those of the other, the flexure of the spine must be in a lateral direction. When the spinal pillar is carried forwards, or laterally, there is

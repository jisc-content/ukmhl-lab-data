183 Thomas's Hospital; the temporal artery was sup-^ posed to have supplied the sac, and therefore it was thought sufficient to tie the vessel. After doing this, it was discovered that the aneiu-ismal tumour still pulsated; Mr. Tyrrell was then obliged to open the sac, and apply four ligatures on the extremities of arteries, which terminated in it. This is not a case of common occurrence; it is seldom necessary to do more than to place a ligature above, and one below the sac. We cannot be much surprised that the pul- sation should have continued after the application of one ligature, as the tumour in an ordinary case would be likely to have been fed by anastomosing branches. But it was quite right, that Mr. Tyrrell should first try the effect of one ligature. FACE. Anatomically speaking, the face is that part which is comprehended between the root of the nose, and the orbitar plates of the frontal bone above; the basis of the inferior jaw below; and the ears laterally; in which space we observe, the cheeks; the eyes; the nose; and the mouth. The cheeks are formed of bones, muscles, and fat; externally, they are covered by common ii^tegu- ment, and they are lined internally by the membrane of the mouth. The muscles of the face, (the masseters excepted),

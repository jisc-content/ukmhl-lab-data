In a former part of the volume, we described the abdominal muscles; but we did not particularize ou their connections at the groin. To do this, will be the present object. If an incision be made from about three inches below the umbilicus, to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium; and another from the commence- ment of this incision, perpendicularly to the sym- physis pubis; we include a portion of integument, under which, are the parts concerned in inguinal and crural hernias. To display these parts, another incil sion in the integument is required, from the centre of the transverse one, directly downwards, to about three inches below the gToin; two flaps of skin will thus be formed, and these flaps are to be carefully dis- sected fi-om the condensed layer of cellular membrane underneath, and reflected; the inner towards the linea alba, and symphysis pubis; the outer towards the spine of the ilium, and the outer part of the thigh.

367 To tie the anterior tibial artery, just after it has perforated the interosseous ligament of the leg, we must dissect through the skin, and fascia, between the tibialis anticus, and the extensor communis muscles. The arter}- lies on the ligament, in company with the venie comites and nerve. About a hand's breadth from the ankle, it is situated between the tibialis anticus, and the extensor longus pollicis; and on the anterior part of the foot, between the first tendon of the extensor commiuiis, and the tendon of the extensor longus pol- licis. At the space, between the tarsal extremities of the meta-tarsal bone of the great toe, and toe next it, the artery dips into the sole of the foot. The posterior tibial artery lies deep, but may be reached at any part of its course. Behind the inner ankle, too, the vessel may be tied: in this situation, the artery bears the same relations to the venae comites, and nerve, as it does higher up. The peroneal artery, below the middle of the leg, is situated at the posterior surface of the fibula. When we trace the arteries of the leg and foot, we find free communications of the muscular branches of the trunks. At the ankles, the anterior tibial sends off the rami malleolares externus et internus, which anastomose with branches sent off about the joint by the posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries. The ante- rior tibial is then continued forwai'ds under the annular

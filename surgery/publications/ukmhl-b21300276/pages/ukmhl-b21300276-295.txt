269 may, therefore, infer what mischief would accrue from their continuity heing' destroyed. It has been jjroved, in a satisfactory maimer, that if one of these nerves be cut across in the neck, the injury is not always mortal, but that the animal soon dies after the division of both; that if one nerve only be divided, the limgs and stomach arc impaired in their functions, but they soon recover them: that the section of both nei-ves, affects the larynx, the heart, the lungs, and stomach; and the animal dies asphyxied. Different explana- tions have, however, been given by different PhysiOr logists, of the cause of death, after dividing the par vagum; but the post mortem appearances incline us to the opinion that asphyxia is the proximate cause. To prove the influence of the phrenic nerves on the action of the diaphragm, it is only necessary to watch the effects of pricking, irritating, and dividing them. By pricking them with a pin, or scalpel, or irritating them by means of some acrid fluid, the muscle contracts. If the nerves be divided, the dia- phragm is paralyzed. The diaphragm, as we have said, is the principal agent in respiration; the other organs are the inter- costal muscles, the abdominal muscles, &c. All these parts are provided with nerves fi-om the spinal marrow. If the spinal marrow be divided above the third cer- vical vertebra, the respiratory function is put a stop to. If the division be made low in the neck, the inter-

368 ligament, and gives off the arteria metatarsea, which furnishes the interosseal branches. The anastomoticus profundus dips down, to inosculate with one of the plantar arteries of the posterior tibial, to form the arcus plantaris, which supplies the digital branches- It is evident, after this view, that either the anterior tibial, the posterior tibial, or the peroneal artery, may be obliterated, without endangering, in the least, the after circulation in the leg and foot. When we were on the a.rteries of the fore-arm and hand, we mentioned that the anastomoses between the branches of the radial, ulnar, and interosseal, were so free, that in case of wound of either of the two first, a ligature was required at each extremity of the wounded vessel. The same remark applies to the treatment of a wound of either of the arteries of the leg and foot. A case has been communicated to me, of the division, by a hatchet, of the anterior tibial artery on the dorsum of the foot. A Surgeon was called, who cut down, and passed a ligature about the trunk, iu the middle of the leg. After doing this, the bleeding continued from the wound, and it was found necessary to secure the vessel at t'le wounded part. The cause of the continuance of tlie hcemon-hage remained unexplained, until it so happened, that on dissecting an injected limb, a mal-distribution of the arteries of the leg was discovered. The anterior tibial terminated by dividing into numerous branches, which wore disti-ibuted about the ankle-joiuts : and the pero-

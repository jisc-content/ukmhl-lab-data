A feeble pulse is indicated b}' the vessel striking the fingers feebly, and being easily obliterated by -pressure. The reverse of this is a strong pulse. The pulse is fiiU, or smaUy according to the diameter of the artery. A hard pulse is a resisting pulse. When tense and resisting, the pulse is wiry; so called from the Jimpressiorl of the artery on the fingers. This descrip- tion ol" pulse usually accompanies the phlegmasiae, and active hjBuiorrhages. A soft pulse is an indi- cation of debility. The pulse is regular, when the same interval of time takes place between the pulsations, and when the pulsations maintain the same character. An irre- 4/u/ur pulse is the reverse of this. The pnlsc is intermittent, when some pulsations arc wanting; and when the pulsations themselves varj' in strength, and character. These are tiic most important varieties of the pulse. Some authors have enumerated many more; and Galen has described thirty-six different kinds. Our judgment in the treatment of disease is often founded on the state of the pulse; it is one of oiir most certain guidiss; but it must be admitted by the Pathologist, that it now and then deceives him.

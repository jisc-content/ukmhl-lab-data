ON THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Bffore making insulated views of the groin, inside of the thigh, ham, leg, and foot, I shall give some prefatoiy remarks on the bones, joints, and mus- cles of the lower extremity'. The thigh-bone is the longest and largest cylin- drical bone in the body. Above, it is received into the acetabulum of the pelvis; below, it is articulated with the tibia, and patella. Its remarkable parts are, the head, neck, great trochanter, little trochanter, linea aspera, and condyles. The hip-joint is like the shoulder, an orbicular one; but the acetabulum, formed by the ilium, ischium, and pubis, is much deeper than the glenoid cavity of the scapula. The joint has two ligaments, the cap- sular without, and the ligamentum teres within the joint; and the former is strengthened by the aponeu- rotic insertions of the muscles of the hip. The arti- culation lies deep; hence, injuries of it are not easy to detect. The head of the femur may be dislocated in four directions, vi/.â€”on the dorsum ilii; into the ischiatic

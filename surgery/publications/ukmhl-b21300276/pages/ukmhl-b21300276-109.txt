85 vessel, nature sets up a pi-occss, by which the flow of blood is soon suppressed; this process consists in the foiTuation of a coaguluni, which fills up the open- ing', and acts mechanically, on the principle of a plug â€¢ lymph, in a little time, is efflised, the wound closed, and the coagiilum is absorbed. If an arteiy of the size of the temporal should be partially cut, natui'c might not be able to stop the bleeding; but if divided completely across, she will be likely to succeed without any assistance: for, when completely cut, the extremities of the vessel retract within the cellular membrane, which entangles the efflised blood, and thus lays the foimdation of a coagulum, which, as in the former case, temporarily shut the bleeding vessel. Although, now and then, nature alone can sujjpress a haemor- rhage, the aid of surgical means is often called for, pai-ticulai-ly if it be of an arterial kind. The common principles in the treatment of haemorrhages, whether internal, or external, is to diminish the force of circulation, by rest, cold, arid the jjroduc- tion of sjTicope; but in external haemon-hages, we may employ other means; such as astiingents, styptics, escharotics, sponge, compression, and the ligatiu*e. How these means act, is sufficiently evident, and I shall only obsei-ve, with respect to the ligature, that its immediate effect, (as proved by Dr. Jones' experi- ments), is the division of the internal, and muscular coats of the artery, and the a])proximation of the

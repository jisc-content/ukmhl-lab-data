3oi^ actual diineusions. Let, however, three inches be the space throug-h which a foetal head can pass, and we shall be able to form a pretty good idea of the pressure which the bones of the cranium must experience, and of the diminution in size which the whole head must undergo, in order to be propelled through the aper- tures of the pelvis. We may infer, from these facts, how desirable it is, that we should possess the means of judging' whether there is sufficient space in the pelvis for the head to jjass, without that artificial assistance which is incompatible with the life of the child: iusti'uments, called pelvimeters, have been in- vented for the purpose, but they are uncertain, and therefore seldom used in this country; we must sub- scribe to the opinion of the able Accoucheui's, Haig-h- ton and Burns, that the hand is the best pelvimeter; the size of the pelvis being determinable with tolerable acciu-acy, by the number of fingers that can be passed into its different parts. The female pelvis is a subject which might lead us to extend our remarks; but the reader must consult Works exclusively devoted to the obstetric art. I must here recall to the student's recollection, the observations which we made on the soft parts bounding tlie pelvic cavity; they apply equally to the female as to the male subject; but in the viscera there is a difference.

31 t - carpus ami tarsus; ami llie irregular, or tliose of the spine. This chissitication is adopted, not on account of thcii- form entirely, bxit from the manner in which ossification proceeds in the different bones. The study of the bones should be commenced with those of the cranium and face; and then, iu suc- cession, we should examine those of the spine, thorax, pehis, upper extremities, and lower extremities.â€” Their situation, coniiexion, fig^ure, processes, fora- mina, general character, and uses, are the points to which the attention should be directed. But to con- sider the bones individually, (though necessary at first) is not of so much real importance to the Surgeon, as to studj them relatively, and combined; for we must seek for the pai'ts formed by their union, and affording lodgment to soft organs. It is obvious, that very little importance can be attached to our knowing the bones of the head and face in their isolated state; but when joined together, they form elevations, and depressions, that must be attended to. If we join two or three vertebrae, we shall have no correct idea of the extent of motion, which the spine tpjoys; because, between any two of the bones, little or no movement is allowed; but the whole, when joined, are capable of extensive motion. To explain the mechanism of the chest, we must examine it in its totality; and the same obtains, with regard to the functions of other parts of the osseous system. The Physiology of the skeleton requires,

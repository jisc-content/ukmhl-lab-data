314 The shoulder-joint has a very extensive dej^ree of motion, from the scapula affording a very superficial lodgement for the head of the os humeri. We can carry the arm forwards, which is called extension; backwards, flexion; from the trunk, abduction; towards the trunk, adduction; and the os liumeri may be made to revolve, which is called rotation. When we carry the arm forwards, the pectoralis major, the anterior portion of the deltoides, the coraco brachialis, the subscapulaiis, and the biceps, are called into action. When in an opposite direction, the posterior fibres of the deltoides, the latissimus dorsi, teres major, teres minor, and triceps, act. Abduction is pei-fonned by the deltoides, and the supra and infra spinati muscles. Adduction, by the pectoralis major, and latissimus dorsi. Rotation inwards, by the sub- scapularis, anterior fibres of the deltoid muscle, latis- simus dorsi, and tei-es major; and rotation outwards, by the posterior fibres of the deltoid muscle, the infra spinatus, and teres minor. The elbow-joint is hinge-like, and capable only of flexion and extension. The flexors are, the biceps, and brachialis internus. The extensors are, the triceps, and anconeus. But the radius moves upon the ulna, producing the motions called pronation and supination. The pronators are, the pronator teres, pronator quadratus, and flexor carpi radialis. The supinators are, the biceps, supinator radii longus, supinator radii brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pol- licis, and extensor primi et secundi interuodii pollicis.

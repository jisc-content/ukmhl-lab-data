251 central line di-awn peri)cncliculai*ly (considering the body erect) we see the pericaidium, which contains the heart; and laterally, are the lungs. The internal figure of the chest is conical; but the basis of the cone is not horizontal; the diaphragm being obliquely placed, so that the posterior part of the chest encroaches more on the abdominal cavity than the anterior; and this muscle is not flat, but convex. This muscular septum will be more particu- larly described when we speak of the paiietes of the abdomen; but the student must, at this time, observe its relations to the thoracic viscera, On raising the sternum, the student would remark a triangular space, formed by the recession of the pleurae. When we saj pleuras, it is not to be mider- stood to mean, that there are two bags, for there is only one; but the term pleurae is made use of by some Anatomists to distinguish the pleura of the right side, from that of the left. It is true, the chest is divided into two distinct cavities, but this merely arises from the attachments of the membrane to the sterniun, before, and to the vertebrae behind; forming the two spaces, named, the mediastina; but here let me observe, the division betAveen the right and left cavity of the chest is not exactly in the middle; as from before, back- wards, the septum passes with a degi'ee of obliquity. The annexed diagram will point out the course of

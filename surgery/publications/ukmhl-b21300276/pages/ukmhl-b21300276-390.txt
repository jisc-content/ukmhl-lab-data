There is no surgical disease upon which more laboiu* has been bestowed, thau heniia. To recommend the student, therefore, to read all the Works that ti'cat on it, would be to impose a task on him, which would require almost a long life to accom- plish ; but he will not do justice to himself, if he neg- lects the perusal of certain modern Works, as those of the present century; amongst which, we must consider Cooper's, Scarpa's, and Lawrence's, as possessing su- perior merit.

200 The principle is to close not only the anterior, but tlie posterior opening. To plug up the posterior narine aperture, a catheter, bougie, or probe with a piece of string at- tached to its extremity, must be passed along the floor of the nostril, until it appears in the fauces behind the curtain of the palate. The string is then to be laid hold of by means of a long di-essing forceps, and drawn out of the mouth. A dossil of lint or sponge is to be tied to it, and by withdrawing the bougie fi-om the nostiil, the plug will be carried to the posterior aper- ture; this will prevent the escape of blood backwards. The anterior opening is then to be well closed; and thus the blood, confined in the nostril between the two i>lugs, coagulates, and mechanically obsti'ucts the bleeding vessels. The pituitai-y membrane of the nose is also called Schneiderian membrane, because Schneider first ac- curately described it. The ancients believed that the membrane was j)erforated in different places, in order to give exit to the mucus of the nose, which they erroneously thought wss secreted by the glandular- like body which occupies the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone, and in confonnity to that supposition, they named it " Glandula Pituitaria," a name still retained; but the fact is, that there is no direct com- munication by any such apertures, for the small body mentioned has nothing to do with the mucus of the

259 sion of the ribs, and the ascent of the diaphragm; the ribs fall in consequence of the intercostales ceasing to act, and by the contraction of the sterno costales, and the five pairs of muscles of the abdomen, aided occa- sionally by the longissimi dorsi, sacro-lumbales, and quadrati lumbornm muscles. It is to be remembered that the diaphragm is the principal agent in both parts of respiration, when the ftmction is executed in a natural manner. In ordinai-y breathing, it is but feebly assisted, even by the intercostales; and it is only when respiration is exceedingly laborious, that the other muscles attached to the ribs are called into actios. The lungs are accurately fitted to the cavity in which they lie, as well in expir ation, as inspiration; this results from the elastic property of these organs. They are kept distended by the pressure of the atmos- phere ; but on puncturing the chest, air will rush into the cavity, and then by the pressure on one side being counter-balanced by pressure on the other, the lungs collapse, becaijse the elastic power can now act with- out resistance. A practical deduction has lately been drawn from this knowledge by Dr. Carson, of Liver- pool, and he has applied it to the ti'catment of the most fatal of all diseases, consumption of the lungs. In an advanced state of phthisis, vomicae, or ab- scesses; ulcerations, and other morbid appearances, are found in the substance of the lungs.

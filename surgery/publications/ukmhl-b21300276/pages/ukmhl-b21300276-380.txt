352 fascia superficialis, and tlie aponeurosis of the external oblitjue; and tlie seat of strangulation is f^cnerally at the place where the internal obli(|ue, and transversalis muscles cross the neck of the sac. When the viscera are protruded throuj^h the external ring', a tumour is formed, and the nature of the disease becomes obvious. It is characterized by being returnable into the abdomen; by disappearing when the patient takes an horizontal posture ; and by its volume being increased by the efforts of coughing^, and sneezing. If the truss be not applied in this stage of the complaint, the tumour will augment in bulk, and will, at last, extend to the scrotum. The coverings of the heniial sac are the same in number, after i)assing the ring, whatever progress the swelling may have made. The common skin is the first tunic; the fascia superficialis, the second ; the fascia of the spermatic cord, the third; the cremaster tunic, the fourth ; and then the sac. Scarpa, however, speaks of a cellular covering over the sac, and between it, and the cremaster. He says, if we dissect with care, a voluminous and old scrotal hernia, (meaning inguinal hernia which has passed into the scrotum), we remark, in the first place, a prolongation, of considerable thickness, of the fascia lata aponeu- rosis, by which he means the fascia of the cord; (by some called fascia propria,) and under it, the cre- master tunic ; these two envelopes are sometimes very

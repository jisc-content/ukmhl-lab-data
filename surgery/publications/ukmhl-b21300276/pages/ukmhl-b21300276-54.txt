I 30 composition, and that for the due and licaltliy office of bone, they must exist in certain proi)ortions; and knowing that there are vessels which can diminish or increase the one or the other, in quantity •, we cannot be astonished at the occunence of preternatural hard- ness or softness. Thus, the diseases of bone may be attributed to the states of the vascular system, as those of the softer textures of the body. An increased action ©f the blood-vessels will constitute inflammation. An increased secretion will produce the effusion of a fluid, Avhich, in time, will be converted into bone, causing' exostosis. A change in the action of the vessels, by which they secrete pus, will give rise to suppuration. An increased action of the absorbents, with the pre- ceding condition of the blood-vessels, will occasion ulceration. The extinction of the vital principle, mortification. And a loss of balance between the secreting and absorbing systems will cause rachitis, moUities ossium, and fragilitas ossium. Consider- ing the subject in this way, the general Pathology of the osseous system is simplified, and found irmch to resemble that of soft parts,—differing only in the slowness of the morbid action, and the tardy progress of reparation; two circumstances arising from the quantity of inorganic matter, Avhich peculiarly charac- terizes the structure of bone. Bones may be divided into four classes, viz.—the flat, or those of the head;—the cylindrical, or those of the extremities;—Uie spherical, or those of the

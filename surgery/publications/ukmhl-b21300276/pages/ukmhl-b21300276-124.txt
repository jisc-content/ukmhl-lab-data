100 ti'iple phosphate, or ammouiaco inagnesian phosphate; and oxalate of lime. Those composed of uric acid, are known by their being laminated, and having the appearance of box-wood. Those composed of the triple phosphate, are white and friable; breaking between the fingers with the greatest ease. And those of the oxalate of lime, have an irregular surface; from which ciixumstance, they are named the mulberry calculi. But there are some calculi composed principally of the phosphate of lime; and others, of the carbo- nate of lime; hence, Dr. Henry has adopted the following classification, which seems to him, sufficient for every purpose of arrangement. Ist.—Calculi which are chiefly composed of uric acid, or urate of ammonia. 2dly.—Calculi principally 'composed of the am- moniaco magnesian phosphate. 3dly.—Calculi consisting, for the most part, of phosphate of lime. 4thy.—Calculi containing, principally, carbo- nate of lime. 5thly.—Calculi which derive their characteristic property from oxalate of lime.

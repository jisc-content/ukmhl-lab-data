^2 Berzclius's Analysis is nearly similar. Serum diflcrs from chyle, in having no white particles. The crassamentum is composed of two sub- stances; fibrin, and red globules. The nature of fibrin is well known; but that of the red globules, or colouring matter of the blood, is still a contested point amongst chemists. It was believed that the red colour depended on the iron which the blood contains; but the opinion has been rendered ques- tioHable by the experiments of Mr. Brande. From them, it is to be inferred that the colom-ing principle is an animal substance of a peculiar natul'e; suscep- tible, like the colouring matter of vegetables, of uniting with bases, and admitting, probably, of im- portant use in the art of dyeing. The blood drawn in inflammatory diseases shows a division of the two component parts of the crassamentum. What we call the " buffy coat" is pure fibrin,' which is separated from the red particles, in consequence of a subsidence of the latter, whose specific gravity ex- ceeds that of any other material of the blood. In inflammation, the blood is attenuated, and coagulates slowly; therefore, time is given for the red globules to sink below the fibrin, and this is the explanation of the phenomenon. The blood is the material used in the formation of new parts, and in the reparation of those injured by accident and disease. During the continuance of

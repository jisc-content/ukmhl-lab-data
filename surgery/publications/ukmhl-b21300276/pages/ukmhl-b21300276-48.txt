24 ossificalion; but in ihe irres^ular hones (as the vertebra'), there are several. If we exainiue a chihl at birth, the osseous system will be foiuid extremely imperfeet. Tlie bones of the head are more aumerous than in the adult subjeet, and very loosely united by means of membrane. When we carry oui- observation from the head of the ehild to the other bones, we see how incompletely they are ossified. The vertebrae are, in a great degree, cartila- ginous ; only here and there are spots of ossific matter visible. The sternum is made up of pieces of bone, deposited in, and surrounded by cartilage. The edges of the bones of the pelvis are tipped with cartilage. The three bones of each os innominatum, and the diiferent pieces of the sacrum, are separated by inter- vening cai'tilages. The cylindiical bones are incom- plete ; theii" ends are cartilaginous, and all their pro- cesses the same. Thus the osseoxis system at birth is very imperfect; although some of the bones are almost completely formed, seven, fourteen, twenty-one, and even twenty-eight yeais will elapse, 'ere all the bones of the body attain their ultimate formation. At the twenty-first year, they are said to have finished their longitudinal growth; hence at this age, man arrives at his full stature; bnt the bones increase laterally from that period up to the tvventj-eighth or thirtieth year, when not only the bones, but all the other struc- tures of the body are supposed to arrive at their acme of symmetry and perfection.

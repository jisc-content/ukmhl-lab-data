The kidnies are tivo imperfectly oyal glands, situated in the lumbar region. They are behind the peritoneum ; therefore, have only an anterior covering from that membrane. In the kidney, we observe two distinct substances ; the external is called the cortical, or secerning; the internal, the tubular part. In the centre is a cavity, named, the pelvis of the kidney; and Irom it, goes off the ureter, or excretory duct, which terminates in the bladder, by an oblique val- >ailar entry between its coats.

The urine is more abundant in quantity than any secretion in the body; and it is more affected by what we eat and drink, than any other. Dr. Henrj' says, in his " Elements of Expe- rimental Chemistry," Ninth Edition, that the following substances appear to him, to have been satis- o

Nothing is more easy than to evert the eye-lid ; it is to be done by means of a probe, which is pressed upon the upper surface of the lid, whilst the Surgeon, laying hold of the eye-lashes with his finger and thumb, draws them upwards. The next part of the appendages of practical importance, is the lachiymal apparatus, which we have described in a former part of the volume. The situa- tion of the sac, and duct must be well studied. The lachrjinal sac, lodged on one half of the os imguis, is bounded above, by the tendon of the orbicularis muscle, and below, by the edge of the orbit. The lachrymal duct is a bony canal, formed by the OS unguis above, the superior maxillaiy bone on the outer side, and the inferior spongy bone on the

In his valuable Work on " Morbid Atiatomy,'' he states, that empyema may be distini^uished with a good deal of certainty, after iiiflammation of the pleura, or lungs, by rigors having taken plaee, by a remission of the pain, by the cough and difficulty of breathing continuing; and by the per- son being able to lie more easily upon the diseased side, than the other.

Blood in the thorax must proceed either from the rupture of a blood-vessel, or vessels; from the trans- udation of this fluid through the relaxed coats of the arteries, or veins; or from the exhalent extremities. If the extravasation be considerable, we must appre- hend danger; but if not great, the coagula may become absorbed, and therefore be productive only of tempo- rary inconvenience- When water, or pus, is actually knomi to be present in the right, or left cavity of the chest, is it safe to puncture the jjaz'ietes for its discharge ? This question involves two considerations; the safety, and

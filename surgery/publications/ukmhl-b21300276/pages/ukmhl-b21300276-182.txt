158 tiilar membrane, aud the fibres of the cremaster muscle. From the testis the cord ascends; passes through the external abdominal ring ; traverses the inguijial canaj, or that oblique space between the two rings; and enters the abdomen thiough the foramen, in the fascia transversalis. On arriving at tliis point, the different component parts of the cord are seen to separate ; the vas deferens descends to the neck of the bladder, and the artery, veins, &c. pass upwards. Thfi e^tcretory duct of each testis, is named the vas deferens, it descends to the vesicula seminalis, a con- voluted body lying at the imder and lateral part of the urinary bladder; and terminates with the duct of the vesicula seminalis, in the urethra, at a process of the lining membrane, called caput gallinaginis, vel veru- ^ontanum. The vesiculae seminales are the reservoirs of the semen; but some Physiologists have assigned to them other purposes. The penis is composed of three bodies; the two corpora cavernosa above, and the corpus spongiosum below; in this last body is the uretjira, or outlet for tlie urine, and semen. The corpora cavernosa, and corpus spongiosum are covered by a continuation of the common skin, which forms anteriorly a loose fold, called, the praj- putium. These paits are plentifully supplied with arteries, veins, absorbents, and nerves.

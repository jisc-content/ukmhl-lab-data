344 veins; the vena saphcna minor terminates in the vena saplicna major, which ends in the femoral vein. The anterial crural nerve is distributed to the skin, and deep muscles on the fore and inner part of the thigh. The great sciatic nerve supplies the remainder of the thigh and leg, and branches of it accompany the anterior tibial, and jjosterior tibial arteries- These general remarks on the distribution of the ai'teries, veins, and nei'ves of the lower extremity, will prepare the student for what we are about to say on the grouping together of parts, in detached views of the groin, inside of the thigh, ham, leg, and foot. The groin is a very important part of the Ana- tomy of the body, and one of peculiar interest to the Surgeon, from bemg connected with heniiae, and from being the situation of the main artery of the lower extremity. Every student who has merely read of the parts Concerned in inguinal and crural lierniaB, justly thinks the subject difficult and embarrassing, and almost despairs of ever knowing what Lecturers, and Anato- mical Writers urge as indispensable. But I will encourage the pupil, by assming him, that there is no point in surgical Anatomy more simple, and that the perplexity which he feels, arises fi-om his substituting

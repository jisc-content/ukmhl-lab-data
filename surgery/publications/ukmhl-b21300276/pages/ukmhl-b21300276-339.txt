About the wrist, there are bursae mucosae, con- nected with the sheaths of tendons; the disease, called ganglion, consists in a preternatural accumulation of the natural secretion of the lining membrane of the bursa; and the carpus is a part of the body where this disease more commonly occurs, than any other. We are to be careful not to mistake one of these swellings for aneurism. Mr. Burne has given a case in the Sixty-seventh Number of the " Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, where this happened. The tumour was situated precisely in the course of the radial artery, it had an evident and general pulsation, and entirely disappeared on the application of firm preiS- sure; but on the removal of the pressure, it re-assumed its former size. Mr. Biu-ne, and other Medical Men, pronotmced it an aneurism. Subsequent examination, however, convinced them that the tumour was a ganglion, and that its gradual enlargement had rai sed the arteria radialis from its natural situation; the lattCj. being found, on an attentive inspection, to pass over the swelling. These are the prefatory remarks wbich T deem essential prior to entering on the muscles, blood- vessels, and nerves. They may appear to the student as premature, as he cannot examine the joints until the muscles are removed; but I would ask, can he

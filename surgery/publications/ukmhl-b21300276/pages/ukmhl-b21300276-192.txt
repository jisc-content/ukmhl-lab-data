170 The bony parts of the nostrils are next to be ob- served, and the terminations of the frontal sphenoidal, and ethmoidal cells, the ductus ad nasum, and the open- ing of the antrum Highmorianum. The bones of the mouth, &c. come next; and of the teeth, the anterior molar of the upper jaiv, which communicate with the floor of the antrum, should be studied; this being a practical point. In the side view, we observe a part of the os frontis; the lateral pai-t of the os parietale; the ostem- porale; the zygomatic arch; the styloid process; the entrance to the organ of hearing; the mastoid process J and a part 6f the os occipitis. The situation of the anterior inferior angle of the temporal bone should be mal-ked in its relative position to the temporal root of the zygoma, which is prominent, and can be felt through the soft parts which cover it; because the angle shows the seat of the artery of the dura mater. The posterior inferior angle must also be noticed, because it corresponds to the comer of the lateral sinus. In this view, in most crania, some irregular portions of bone are seen between the parietal, temporal, and occipital bones; they are called ossa triqueti-a, and have been mistaken for depressed fragments; the student, therefore, should be aware of their situation, in order to avoid such a dangerous error. T\\Q posteridr view is chiefly occupied by the os occipitis, of which the ridges and tuber are femarkable

333 ligament. And thirdly, that species Avhere tlie bone is broken tkrough the ti-ochaiiter major, beyond its junction with the cervix femoris. Between the three kinds, he makes this important distinction; in the first, no re-union will take place; but the two last will admit of imion, like fractures of other bones. Sir Astley qualifies the opinion that he has given, by say- ing, that if, in the first place, a bony union ever does happen, it is an extremely rare occurrence, and that he has not yet met with a single example of it. The reasons which he assigns for the absence of ossifie union in the transverse fracture witMn the capsular ligament, are these: 1st.—The want of proper apposition of the bones ; for if the broken extremities, in any part of the body, be kept much asunder, ossifie union is prevented, 2ndly.—The want of pressure of one bone upon the other, even where the length of the limb is pre- served. This will operate in j)reventing union, in cases where the capsular ligament is not torn, in con- sequence of the secretion of a quantity of fluid into the joint, from increased determination of blood to the capsular ligament; this distends the ligament, and thus entirely pi*events the contact of the bones, by pushing the upper end of the thigh-bone, from the acetabulum. The thii'd, and principal reason assigned by Sir

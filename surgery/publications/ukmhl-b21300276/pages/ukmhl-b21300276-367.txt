339 The muscles of adduction are, the iliacus iatermis, psoas maguus, pectineus, gracilis, adductores, obtu- rator externus, and quacb-atus femoris. The muscles of rotation iuvvaids are, the auterior portions of the glutaeus medius, and glutajus minimus, the tensor vaginae femoris, sartorius, and gi-acilis. The muscles of rotation outwards are, the glutaeus maximus, glutseus medius, pyriformis, gemini, obtu- rator externus, quadratus femoris, iliacus intemus, psoas magnus, and three adductores. The knee is like the elbow, a ginglymoid joint; when the leg is a little bent, however, a slight rotatory motion can be performed. The muscles of the anterior part of the thigh (the sartorius excepted) are, the ex- tensors. Those of the posterior part are, the flexors. The rotators inwards are, the muscles which go to be inserted into the tibia. The rotator outwards is, the biceps, which is inserted into the fibula. The ankle-joint is hinge-like, but in addition to flexion and extension, it can be bent inwards and outwards. The flexors are, the tibialis anticus, and the extensor muscles of the toes. The extensors are, the gastrocnemii, plantaris, tibialis posticus, peronei, and flexors of the toes. The benders inwards are, the tibialis posticus, the extensor proprius pollicis, and the flexors of the toes.

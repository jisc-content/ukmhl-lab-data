194 The principal appendages of the eye are situated superficially; they are the eye-brows, eye-lids, eye- lashes, the tunica conjunctiva, canincula lachrvmalis, and the apparatus concerned in the secretion and dis- charge of the tears. Some of these parts are visible, and can be demonstrated without the aid of dissection ; but there are others that cannot he. The kiiife is re- quired to display the lachrymal glaiid and sac; and to show the ductus ad nasum, we must break through bone; the commencement, course, and termination of the duct may, however, be shown without this trouble. The reflection of the tunica conjunctiva is a point of Anatomy well deserving of attention. The student will find, by eveiiing the upper and under e3^e-lids, â€¢that this membrane does not merely give a covering to the surface of the eye, but after running a little back- wards, it is reflected so as to line the lids; thus, it connects the globe of the eye with the lids, and pre- vents extraneous matters from passing beyond a cer- tain point. It often happens, that the eye is much pained by the presence of dust, or gritty matter; but as on superficial examination, the source of irritation cannot be detected, the eye is pronounced inflamed, although the inflammation obstinately resists the com- mon treatment. I have seen very distressing cases of this kind; and one of them, which occm'red when I was a pupil, made a strong imjiression on my mind. In this case, the cause was not susjjcctcd; the eye assumed the usual appearance of inflammation, and

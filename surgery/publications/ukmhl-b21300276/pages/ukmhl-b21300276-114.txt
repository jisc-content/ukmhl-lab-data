90 similar in its properties and uses, to the synovia of the joints. The membrane lining the interior of the bones, is liable to inflammation from common and specific causes. When it tenninates in the formation of matter, the disease is called " spina ventosa." The synovial membrane too may be affected, with inflam- mation from common, and specific causes, B.â€”The Jluids of the lining membranes of the three grand cavities of the body, are the second class of fluids. The cranium is lined by a membrane, called dura mater, which, too, is the external envelope of the brain. Under it, are the tunica arachnoidea, and pia mater. The outer surface of the dura mater is in intimate attachment with the bones of the skull. Their adhesion is so close, as to leave no intervening space. Between the inner surface of the dura mater, and the outer surface of the tunica arachnoidea, however, there is an interspace, and this is continued down the spine. It is here that we find a lubricating serous fluid, to prevent the membranes from adhering. It is secreted by the vessels of the dura mater; and a pretematiu-al collection of it constitutes the disease called, hydi-ops menibranarum, Vel hydrocephaltis extenius. In the thorax, we find a lining and reflected membrane, called the pleura, which is of a serous kind. It

87 a one as is compatible with safety; a large ligature is too great a source of irritation, and a very small one >vill incur the risk of secondaiy haemorrhage, by cutting through the vessel 'ere the sealing process is completed. As a general rule, we may say, all arteries infe- rior in size to the temporal, may safely, in case of woimd, be trusted to compression, which is the next most powerful means to the ligature; but when the vessel is of a larger size, one, if not two ligatures will be necessary. From the blood, certain fluids are separated by Glands, or Secreting Organs. No part of Physiology is more obscure than this process of secretion. Our knowledge of it is so limited, that we can only say, certain structures have the abilify, from a peculiar arrangement of their parts, to form particular kinds of fluids from the blood, which are either accessary to the performance of certain animal ftmctions; or necessary, in order to rid the system of materials, which, if retained, would prove injurious to its (Economy. There are three kinds of secreting organs in the body; the membranous, the follicular, and the duc- tiform, or complex. Of the first kind, are the dura mater, pleura, peritoneum, tunica vaginalis, and other serous mem-

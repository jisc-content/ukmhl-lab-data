493 VITAL STATISTICS under one year of age per 1000 births was 163 for England and Wales in 1899, being lowest in the agricultural counties and highest in raining and manufacturing counties. In the thirty- three great towns it averaged 172 in the year 1900, ranging fi'om 132 in Croydon, Hudders- field, and Halifax, to 236 per 1000 births in Preston. Of 1000 male children born in England and Wales in 1881-90 the number surviving at the age of three months was 921, at the age of six months 889, twelve months 839, while the number of female children surviv- ing one year of 1000 born was 869. In towns a smaller number survive. In the causation of this high infantile mortality ignorance and in- experience on the part of parents play a con- siderable part, especially as influencing the food and mode of feeding. The death-rates at other age-groups beyond infancy are given in Table I. Season influences the death-rate. The third quarter of the year has the lowest death-rate, unless the amount of epidemic diarrhoea has been excessive. In the first quarter of the year the highest death-rate usually occurs. Mild winters and cool summers both lower the mortality. The seasonal incidence of infectious diseases need only be mentioned in passing. Density of Population has important bear- ings on the death-rate. Thus the urban districts in 1899 had a death-rate of 19'2, and the rural of 16"3 per 1000 of population. Farr found that the death-rate increased with the density of populations, not in direct proportion, but in proportion to the 6 th roots of the contrasted populations. This rule does not now hold generally good. It is only after the density has reached a certain degree of intensity that it begins to exert an appreciable effect. Even then it is what is implied in aggregation, rather than the aggregation itself, that is pernicious. In particular, poverty is usually greater in densely populated districts than elsewhere, with its accompaniments of deficient food and cloth- ing and bad housing. Hence the excess of phthisis in tenemented houses, especially in houses with three rooms or less. I have shown that the true density that should be considered is the number of persons to each room, not the number of persons on a given area ("The Vital Statistics of the Peabody Buildings," Roy. Statist. Soc, Feb. 1891). Occupation and Mortality. — To obtain correct statistics showing the influence of occu- pation on vitality, one must know the number and age of those engaged in each industry and the corresponding number of deaths. A state- ment of the mean age at death of those engaged in different occupations would be most fallacious (p. 494). The best plan is to restrict the sta- tistics to men aged twenty-five to sixty-five, and calculate for these death-rates in a standard population, after the fashion already described (p. 491). By this means a "comparative mor- tality figure" can be obtained. For all males it is 1000, for farmers 563, teachers 603, lawyers 821, doctors 966, butchers 1096, plumbers 1120, brewers 1427, innkeepers 1659, potters 1706, file-makers 1810. Speaking gener- ally, the occupations are most unhealthy in which there is the greatest exposure to dust, to the breathing of foul air, and to excessive in- dulgence in alcoholic drinks. (For further details, see the author's Elements of Vital Statistics, p. 169 et seq.) Deaths from Various Causes.—These may be stated in proportion to total deaths from all causes, or in terms of the population. The first plan must be adopted only when it is desired to ascertain the proportional share of a given cause of death in the total mortality. In 1899 in England and Wales the diseases named in the first column of the following table were the most prolific causes of death :— England and Wales, 1899.—Deaths from vari- ous Causes to 10,000 Deaths from all Causes. Bronchitis 880 Influenza . . 213 Phthisis . 729 Whooping-cough . 174 Pneumonia 685 Measles . 172 Old age 541 Diphtheria . 160 Diarrhoea, Dysentery 511 Enteric fever . 108 Cancer 452 Scarlet fever . 64 Apoplexy . 327 Smallpox . 3 The diseases in the second column are given in order to indicate their proportional share of the total number of deaths. The proper plan of stating the death-rate from a given disease is in terms of the popula- tion, or better still, subdivided into death-rates from the diseases for different age-groups, as in Table I., if the number of deaths is not too small to admit of this. The importance of stating the death-rate for different age-groups is greatest for such diseases as diarrhoea, whooping-cough, and measles, in which most of the deaths occur at ages under five. In the following table are given the death-rates from the causes of death which are most important, either from their magnitude, or because of their preventible character:— England and Wales, 1899.—Death-rate per 1000 Persons living.

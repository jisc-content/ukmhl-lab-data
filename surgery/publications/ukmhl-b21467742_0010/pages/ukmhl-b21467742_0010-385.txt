369 UTERUS, MALIGNANT TUMOURS OF THE tions, even in cases which seem favourable with- out this critical examination, is well shown in the subjoined table. It is very important to exercise a rigid selection of cases for operation, otherwise vaginal hysterectomy for cancer runs a great risk of being discredited. The table was drawn up by Dr. Crewdson Thomas, the registrar: the patients were admitted during 1897, 1898, 1899, and 1900. During these years the average number of women who were operated upon for diseases of the genital organs was 500 yearly. The lists show the frequency of the disease, and also demonstrate that cancer of the cervix has an extremely significant relation to childbirth. So far as this table is concerned, and indeed in very large collections of cases, cancer of the cervix is seen to be intimately associated with the later period of sexual life and the decade following the menopause. It is almost unknown before the twenty-fifth year, the great propor- tion of cases falling in the zone between the thirtieth and fifty-fifth years of life.

X An interesting feature in relation to cancer of the neck of the uterus is its occurrence in women many years subsequent to double ovari- otomy. Examples of this are recorded in the Transactions of the Obstetrical Society, London, vols, xxxvii. 213, and xliii. 214. Cancer op the Neck op the Uterus and Pregnancy.—It may be stated without fear of contradiction that the most appalling complica- tion of pregnancy is cancer of the cervix. It is somewhat difficult to understand how a woman with cancer of the neck of the uterus can con- ceive, but it is quite certain that it happens when the disease is well established. From a careful inquiry, the writer is persuaded that this complication is not uncommon, but that the cases in which cancer of the neck of the uterus obstructs labour are unusual, and this is due to two circumstances — (1) that the cancer prodisposes to abortion; and (2) that when it has advanced to such a stage as to fill the vagina with an obstructive mass, it has had such an effect upon the health of the mother that it endangers the life of the foetus. This is a matter of some importance, because in con- sidering the advisability of performing Ctesarean section in these circumstances, it is necessary to be certain that the foetus is really alive. However, in very exceptional cases it has been found absolutely necessary to resort to this operation in order to deliver a dead and putrid foetus. The careful study of the literature relating to this complication shows clearly enough that, when a pregnant woman with early cancer of the uterus comes under observation in the early months, her best hope lies in vaginal hyster- ectomy. In the later stages (fourth to seventh months) very good consequences have followed the amputation of the cervix, and this operation has been carried out very successfully and with- out disturbing the pregnancy. In the latest stages the best consequences have followed the induction of labour and the immediate perform- ance of vaginal hysterectomy, for, surprising as it may seem, the uterus, though enlarged from the pregnancy, can be safely extirpated through the vagina. These methods of treatment only apply to cases where the cancer is in such a condition as to afford reasonable hope of a prolongation of life. When the disease is in an inoperable stage and the fa3tus is dead, then after a little patient waiting abortion usually occurs. When there is reliable evidence that the foetus is alive, then the pregnancy should be allowed to go to term ; if the cancer affords an impassable barrier to the transit of the child, then Csesarean section becomes a necessity. Cancer of the Body of the Uterus.—This is much less frequent than cancer of the neck of the uterus, and it arises in the epithelium lining the cavity of the uterus and its tubular 24

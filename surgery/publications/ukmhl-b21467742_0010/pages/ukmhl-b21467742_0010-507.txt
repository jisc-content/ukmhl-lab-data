VITAL STATISTICS 491 in which corrections have been made should be given in the table below :— Thus at ages over 5 and under 45 for males, and under 55 for females, the death-rate is Area of District in acres (exclusive of area covered by water). Total population at all ages m Is Number of inhabited houses f q ^ Average number of persons per house [See below. I. Institutions within the District receiving Sick and Infirm Persons from outside the District. II. Institutions outside the District receiving Sick and Infirm Persons from the District. III. Other Institutions, the Deaths in which have been distributed among the several Localities in the District. The population as well as the deaths of these institutions should be excluded, in so far as they are derived from outside the district, in order to make the net death-rate approximately correct. Theoretically, the correction ought to be ex- tended so to apply to visitors who do not die in public institutions. In practice, however, this cannot be effected until a central " clearing- house " is established. The exclusion of deaths of visitors from the district in which they occur is easy; their inclusion in the returns of the district from which they came is more difficult to secure. For the present, they should be included in the death-rate of the district in which they occur. Death-Rate according to Age and Sex.— To obtain a true conception of the death-rate in a community it is necessary to state the number of deaths in each sex in proportion to the number living at different ages. The im- portance of this is shown by the following extract from the Registrar-General's report for 1899 :— lower than is the total death-rate for all ages For females at all ages, except from 5 to 15, the death-rate is lower than for males. From the above statement it will be clear that a considerable excess of women (as in a residential district with a large number of domestic servants), or a considerable excess of either sex at the ages of 15 to 45 (as in most large towns), in proportion to the number living at other ages, would produce a lower total or crude death-rate, which does not necessarily imply a more healthy condition than that of another district which is less favourably con- stituted so far as the proportion of the sexes and the numbers living at different ages are concerned. By a means of correction now to be described, this source of error can be elimi- nated. The method of obtaining the factw for cor- rection can be best understood by an example. The annual death-rate of England and Wales in 1881-90 was 19-15, and the death-rate at Table I. England and Wales.—Deaths to 1000 living at each of Twelve Groups of Ages. All Ages.

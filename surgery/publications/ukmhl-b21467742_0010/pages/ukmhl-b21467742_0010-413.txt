VACCINATION 397 something to have urged the need of greater care in the direction of asepsis upon the vacci- nators themselves, and through them upon the mothers. It may be hoped that the lesson will in time he taken to heart even more than has been done at present, and that a very large reduction in the number of vaccination accidents will be the result. What can be done in Ger- many is not impossible in England. The Effect of the Vaccination Act of 1898.—The Act of 1898 did great service to vaccination by introducing the use of glyceri- nated calf-lymph instead of humanised lymph. As calves cannot take the syphilitic poison there is absolutely no possibility of its being conveyed from them, and this particular danger, rare as it was, no longer exists when calf-lymph is used. The risk of tuberculosis is not quite so completely removed. Calves can be tubercu- lous, though they are less prone to the disease in early life than they are later. But every calf used for the manufacture of calf-lymph is put to death and thoroughly examined before the lymph is distributed. In the rare cases in which any evidence of tubercular infection is found the lymph from that source is immediately destroyed. But even if this were not always done, by the thorough and intimate admixture of glycerine with the lymph, and by storing the mixture for a considerable time under conditions which prevent the access of light and air, Dr. Copeman believes that all foi-eign or extraneous organisms in the lymph, including the tubercle bacillus, are gradually destroyed, and the vaccine organism only left. The Act of 189s further abolished the vacci- nation stations, and ordered the public vacci- nator to vaccinate the child at home and to inspect the result of the operation there, on the eighth day. It permitted the father to obtain a certificate of exemption for his child, on application to a magistrate, as a "conscien- tious objector " to vaccination. How far has the Act of 1898 been on the whole a success or the reverse 1 The " con- scientious objector " clause was passed in the interests of vaccination. The framers of the Act believed that the final result of allowing parents to ask for exemption from the duty of having their children vaccinated would be to diminish resistance of the law. They required the father to appear before a magistrate and to declare that he " conscientiously disapproved " of vaccination. This was intended to involve a certain amount of trouble. While permitting conscientious objectors to get leave to disregard the law, many important practical improvements were made in the administration of vaccination. The use of glycerinated calf-lymph, the aboli- tion of vaccinating stations, and the much greater care to keep the wounds aseptic, all told in support of vaccination; and it seems probable that these influences are pi-oducing an eff'ect. Certainly, in almost every union-county in England the number of children vaccinated in 1901 greatly exceeded the number in 1898. With but one exception—the North Riding of York—all the union-counties in the following table show increased numbers vaccinated in 1901 ; and in many cases, e.g. in Bedford, Chester, Derby, Essex, Leicester, Lancaster, Nottingham, Stafford, and Warwick, the in- crease is very considerable— Certificates of Successful Vaccination. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. neatoia 325 1,830 1,456 1,579 rSeiKS . 4,121 4,864 4,397 5,325 Buckingham 1,896 3,904 3,029 3,179 Cambridge . 3,332 4,598 4,298 4,385 Chester 16,891 19,518 19,382 18,430 Cumberland 4,601 6,094 7,333 6,986 Derby . 4,477 9,459 7,903 8,027 Devon 11,012 11,008-4 13,413 12,835 Dorset 2,826 3,845 3,932 3,933 Durham 26,720 29,270 29,902 32,146 Essex . 11,834 18,699 20,775 22,877 Gloucester . 5,477 10,816 10,206 10,162 Hertford 2,950 4,333 4,601 4,770 Huntingdon 925 1,383 979 1,037 Kent . 14,174 18,961 19,840 20,349 Lancaster . 74,951 101,768 103,402 97,556 Leicester 769 3,150 3,478 3,265 Lincoln 5,780 9,253 9,939 9,925 London 63,326 86,514 86,591 111,958 ivxiuuiebcA. . . 9,283 15,003 15,953 20,624 Monmouth . 6,092 7,595 7,661 8,144 Norfolk 5,963 8,277 9,161 8,934 Northampton 1,718 3,755 3,510 3,454 Northumberland . 10,538 12,598 14,088 14,559 Nottingham 6,384 11,289 11,927 12,252 Oxford 2,907 4,303 4,055 3,479 Salop . 4,826 6,089 6,006 6,100 Somerset 5,780 9,127 7,953 7,944 Southampton 12,940 15,204 16,313 16,416 Stafford 19,184 31,857 29,232 30,169 Suffolk 5,830 7,166 7,562 7,566 Surrey 9,233 11,395 12,246 16,836 Sussex 7,388 9,584 10,018 10,600 Warwick 15,111 20,257 19,926 20,181 Westmoreland 1,233 1,440 1,348 1,276 Wilts . 2,586 4,379 4,143 4,132 Worcester . 8,757 10,481 11,053 11,527 York—East Riding 8,792 13,672 10,734 10,791 West Riding 46,390 60,703 58,816 58,027 North Riding 8,443 8,249-194 8,448 8,123 Comparing the number of successful vaccina- tions in 1898 and in 1901, a considerable increase is seen, and the increase is maintained year by year. In 1898 the successful primary vaccina- tions were 500,314 ; in 1901, they were 710,785. That a considerable epidemic of smallpox has been present in London and in some parts of England and Scotland for the last two years does not prove that the Act of 1898 was a failure. Vaccination had been greatly neglected for many years, and no legislation could possibly do away with the inevitable results of this

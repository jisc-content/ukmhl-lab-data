490 VITAL STATISTICS years," shows the real excess of 144 per cent. Both in this and other civilised countries there has been in the last twenty-five years a steady decline in the birth-rate. In England the maximum birth-rate was 36*3 per 1000 of population in 1876, and the minimum 29'3 in 1899. This diminution is only caused to a minor degree by postponement of marriage to more mature years and by a larger proportion of celibacy. Nor is there any reasonable ground for the view that a diminished power of either sex to produce children has been produced by alcohol, syphilis, tobacco, or other causes. The main cause of the diminution of the birth-rate is "the deliberate and voluntary avoidance of child-bearing on the part of a steadily increasing number of married persons." Deaths are calculated in proportion to every 1000 of the population, the unit of time being a year. This unit is preserved even when death-rates for shorter periods, e.g. a week, are stated. Thus the death-rates for the thirty- three great towns published weekly in the chief newspapers are annual death-rates; they represent the number who would die per 1000 of the population, supposing the same propor- tion of deaths to population held good through- out the year. The best plan to obtain the weekly annual death-rate is as follows: the correct number of weeks in a year being 52'17747, if the population of a town be 143,956, and the number of deaths in a given week are 35, then the death-rate is 12-687. Thus 143,956 . 5-2-17747' = 2758 1000 _ 2758" 0-3625. This is the factor by which the weekly number of deaths must be multiplied 35 X 0-3625 = 12-6875 or 12-7. The above is the crude death-i'ate. Various corrections are required, which must now be considered. The most important of these are for public institutions, for visitors, and for age and sex. A public institution, e.g. a work- house, infirmary, or asylum in a given district may consist almost entirely of persons belong- ing to another district. The rule is to rele- gate to the district to which they belong all deaths of inmates of an institution, i.e. sub- tract all deaths of outsidei's occurring in inside institutions, and add all deaths of inhabit- ants occurring in outside institutions. The following copy of the official table recently authorised by the Local Government Board for the annual reports of medical officers of health shows the columns giving the necessary corrections. Note.—The deaths to be included in Column 7 of this table are the whole of those registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district or division. The deaths to be included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7, corrected by the subtraction of the number in Column 10, and the addition of the number in Column 11. By the term "Non-resident" is meant per- sons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public institutions there; and by the term " Resi- dents " is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere. The " public institutions" to be taken into account for the purposes of these tables are those into which persons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses, and lunatic asylums.

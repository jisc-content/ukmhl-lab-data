VACCINATION 391 1893 to 1897, with increased pressure in favour of vaccination, the average mortality was re- duced to 99 per million, not good in itself, but much better than before. To reduce the mortality to the lowest possible, the vaccination law should be compulsory, the methods of its supervision carefully organised, and revaccina- tion in early adult life made obligatory. In Switzerland, some of the cantons have no compulsory infant vaccination. The towns of Basle and Zurich are in these cantons. Much indirect pressure in favour of vaccination is, however, given in the absence of a compulsory law, and in some districts from 60 to 78 per cent of the children are vaccinated. There is nowhere in Switzerland any compulsory revac- cination. Grouping the cantons in which infant vaccination is the law into one group, and those in which it is not the law into another, the small pox death-rates per million living are as follows:— Year.

The laws date from 1888 and 1891. The actual number of smallpox deaths in 1889, before the new law had taken effect, was 13,416 ; in 1898 it had fallen to 420. This is in a population of about 30 millions. The mortality rate per annum for the five years 1893 to 1897 is much higher, amounting, where averaged, to nearly 73 per million. The actual deaths from 1893 to 1898 were these :—- Year.

The mortality in Italy even after the laws of 1888 and 1891 was very high ; gradual improvements in administration have brought it down, under the same law, to 420. In Hungary the vaccination law dates from 1887, in which year there was a smallpox mortality of 18,063. In 1898 this was reduced to 1656. For the five years 1893-97 the average rate per million was 134 = 2412 deaths each year. There is still evidently great room for adminis- trative improvements in carrying out the law in Hungary. In the Netherlands there is no compulsory infant vaccination, but vaccination certificates are required from all pupils and teachers in schools. A considerable proportion of the infant population is vaccinated every year, in spite of the absence of a compulsory law. The smallpox mortality rate per million in the five years 1893-97 was 38-7. In Spain there is no law enforcing vaccina- tion, and for the four years 1893-96 the mortality rate per million was 563-4. In Russia there is also no law enforcing vac- cination, and for the five years 1893-97 the mortality rate in a population (including Asiatic Russia) of 119 millions was 463 2 ; i.e. in each year the deaths from smallpox are believed to have been over 55,000. The following tables show at a glance the varying rates of smallpox mortality per million of population under varying conditions as to vaccination and revaccination. The effiect of legal pressure in support of vaccination is seen by taking the smallpox mortality in various countries and decades, and contrasting it in each case with the mortality in Sweden before the introduction of vaccination, which is accur- ately known:— Before Vaccination, per Million of Population.

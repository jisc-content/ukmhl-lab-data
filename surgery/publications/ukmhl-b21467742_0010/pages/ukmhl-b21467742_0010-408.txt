VACCINATION 392 In studying this table it must be remembered that Germany is surrounded by populations (Russia, Holland, Austria, France) which have had till lately no compulsory general vaccination law, and that most of the cases in Germany occur on the frontiers. Further evidence is obtained from the facts tabulated thus:— Recent Death-rates from Smallpox per Million Living, for the Ten Years 1890-99, in Four Countries. Sweden. Scotland. Belgium.

Time and patient effort to improve administration will be required everywhere to reach results equal to those seen in Germany. In the survey now made of the effect of legal compulsion as regards vaccination and revaccina- tion in European countries the evidence all points the same way, viz. that efhcieut vaccination and revaccination greatly diminish the number of deaths from smallpox, and that a compulsory law for vaccination and revaccination is neces- sary if a nation is to be free from a large small- pox mortality. It is, however, necessary to bear well in mind that it is not the existence of a law in favour of vaccination that protects, but the fact that the individual members of the community have obeyed the law. It is mis- leading to speak of places as being well vaccin- ated. The place is not the unit: every person in each place is protected or not according to his own vaccination and revaccination. Where there is a minority of people who are not pro- ^ The actual number of deaths from smallpox in the Russian empire, including Asiatic Russia, in the five years quoted was 275,502. tected, they are liable to take the contagion of smallpox if exposed to it, no matter how well protected their neighbours may be. They are, of course, much more liable to meet the con- tagion if they are surrounded by people who are able to receive and to communicate it, but this is all they gain by the protected con- dition of their neighbours. If and when they do meet the contagion they are pretty certain to take it. One of the most important proofs of the value of vaccination has been the change of the age at which smallpox deaths mostly occur now as compared with the age at which they chiefly occurred in pre-Jennerian times. It is certain that before the practice of vac- cination, smallpox was the most dreaded and the most fatal of all the diseases of children. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was said by some authorities to account for half the total mortality of children under ten years of age. Among other proofs which might be quoted in support of this statement, the following may be given. In Chester in 1774 all the 202 deaths in an epidemic were those of children under ten, and 50 of the deaths were in children under one year of age. In Warrington in 1778 all the deaths were those of young children. In Kilmarnock, of 622 deaths which occurred in several epidemics, the ages of 9 are not given, but all the rest were under ten years of age. The burial registers of St Cuthbert's and Buccleuch Street, Edinburgh, show that during the years 1764-83, of every 1000 deaths from smallpox 993 were those of children imder ten. The smallpox deaths at the Hague for fifteen years numbered 7473 ; of these, 6045 were of children under five. In the Final Report the Commissioners say that " in all records of epidemics where the ages are given, the mortality was mainly among infants." In Berlin from 1758 to 1774 there were 6705 smallpox deaths; of these, 5876 were of children under five (= 87 per cent), and of children under ten there were 6618 ( = 99 per cent). In Manchester, 1769-74, of 589 smallpox deaths, 559 (= 94 per cent) were of children under five. In 1796, in Berlin, of 817 deaths only one was over sixteen years of age. The opponents of vaccination are fond of say- ing that smallpox was a trifling illness, "a mere disease of children." The records now quoted scarcely justify the "mere" or the "trifling." The truth is, it was a fearful scourge, and a terror to all parents. The explanation of the very great mortality of young children as compared with adults is to be found in the rapidity with which epidemics of smallpox followed each other. In each epidemic those who died were probably about one-seventh of those attacked. The six-sevenths recovered and were immune for many years, often for life. They had purchased immunity

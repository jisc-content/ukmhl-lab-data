VACCINATION 393 by suffering, possibly by loss of sight, almost always by permanent disfigurement. In isolated places and where epidemics came at long inter- vals many adults died, because there were in this case fewer adults who were protected by having had the disease in childhood. Since vaccination has been employed, and since it has been practised mainly in early infancy, the mortality rates, as between infancy and adult life, have completely changed. Children are now the protected class, and their protection is stronger the younger they are, because they are then nearer to their vaccination. It would be difficult to even suggest any possible cause other than vaccination for this striking change in the age incidence of the mortality from smallpox. The Sheffield epidemic 1887-88 aflrorded a good illustration of the value of vaccination in early life. There were in Sheffield 33,393 vac- cinated children iinder five years of age. Of these, 121 ( = 0'36 per cent) took smallpox, and one child died from it ( = 0 003 per cent of the total number). Of unvaccinated children under five there were 1981, of whom 128 (6-5 per cent) took the disease, and 66 died of it ( = 3'3 per cent of the whole number of unvaccinated children, and 51 per cent of the children at- tacked). The table of the Sheffield mortality in age classes is instructive : — rate," in the two classes, and at the varying ages. The Sheffield figures are often quoted by the opponents of vaccination. They say Sheffield was a well-vaccinated place, and yet smallpox caused 474 deaths, of which 200 were of vac- cinated people. When analysed, the figures show clearly how great the protection of vaccina- tion is in early life, and how necessary revaccina- tion is to renew the protection for later life. The study of the proportion of deaths be- tween the ages 0 to 10 at different places also gives evidence which is worth considering, vaccination being much more practised in some places than in others. Taking six places where recent epidemics have been carefully studied, we find that the percentage of mortality in cases under ten years of age varies very much, and that where vaccination has been to a great extent in abeyance the infant mortality from smallpox is the highest.

The fifth column gives the actual number of deaths at each age. It shows how the protection of vaccination wears out progressively with age. The sixth column shows the percentage of deaths to the number of inhabitants; and the seventh the percentage of deaths to attacks, or the " fatality the age at which they should be vaccinated. In London there had been a considerable falling off in the amount of vaccination for some time before the epidemic of 1892. In Warrington and Sheffield the law had been fairly well obeyed. At Dewsbury vaccination had been greatly neglected. At Leicester vaccination had been largely abandoned for some time before the epidemic. At Gloucester vaccination fell into almost complete disuse for

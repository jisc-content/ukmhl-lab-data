Definition.—Tuberculosis is a chronic infective disease caused by the tubercle bacillus. Man and all domesticated animals may suffer from it. Wild animals, particularly the carni- vora, are insusceptible. While this is so, it is probable that all animals may be infected by tuberculosis if placed in suitable environment and with suitable doses of the organism. It has been stated that 7 per cent of mankind die from tuberculosis, and that from 30 to 50 per cent of cows in Britain are tuberculous. Etiology.—In the causation of the disease one must bear in mind two factors, the soil and the germ. In the absorbing discussions which are taking place concerning the tubercle bacillus and its modes of entrance into the body, we are apt to give insufficient weight to the personal factor. It is now generally concluded that the bacillus is only capable of taking root in individuals whose nutrition and power of resistance are greatly lowered. In fact, tuber- culosis may be looked on as the sequel of another debilitating condition due to accident or disease. As, however, the tubercle bacillus bulks so largely in our consideration of the disease, we shall first consider it morphologically and bio- logically, returning later to the personal factor in the disease, when considering the portals of

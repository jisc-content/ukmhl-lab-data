196 TYPHOID FEVER Diagnosis of Cerebral form of Typhoid Fever from Tubercular Meningitis.—In both there occur pyrexia, headache, vomiting. Typhoid Fever 1. Gradual ascent of temperature. 2. Generally drowsiness. 3. Vomiting rare. 4. Optic neuritis very rare. 5. Abdomen tumid. 6. Spleen enlarged. 7. Cutaneous eruption. 8. Cranial nerve affections very rare. 9. Widal's test positive. 10. Knee jerk persistent. 11. No signs of tubercular deposit elsewhere in the body. Typhoid Fever 1. Temperature rises gradually and is subse- quently of continued type. 2. Splenic enlargement. 3. Cutaneous eruption. 4. Character of stools distinctive. 5. Widal's test affirmative. 6. Local tenderness in right iliac region. 7. No ascites. 8. History of exposure to contagion. 9. Previous health good. Meningitis 1. Rapid rise of temperature. 2. Generally cerebral irritability. 3. Vomiting common. 4. Optic neuritis often. 5. x\bdomen retracted. 6. Spleen not enlarged. 7. No cutaneous eruption. 8. Cranial nerve paralysis common. 9. Widal's test negative. 10. Knee jerks may disappear and reappear with a few days' interval. 11. Often evidences of tubercle in lymphatic glands or lungs, etc. In both conditions there occur pyrexia. Tubercle of Peritoneum 1. No step-like ascent of temperature, which is often remittent or intermittent. 2. No splenic enlargement. 3. No cutaneoiis eruption. 4. No distinctive character of stools. 5. Widal's test negative. 6. Tenderness not limited to right iliac region. 7. Often ascites, 8. Often evidences of tubercle in lymphatic glands, etc. 9. Often precedent loss of flesh. Diagnosis between Typhoid and Tubercle of Peritoneum.— diarrhoea, abdominal distention, and emaciation. Diagnosis between Typhoid Fever and Acute Pulmonary Tuberc2dosis.—In both there occur high fever, cough, dyspnoea, expectoration, and the "physical signs" of acute pulmonary catarrh. Typhoid 1. There may be step-like ascent of tempera- ture, but often the rise is abrupt. 2. Epistaxis common. 3. Splenic enlargement. 4. Pulse dici-otic. 5. Prostration moderate. 6. Roseolar eruption after tenth day. 7. AVidal's test positive after tenth day. 8. No evidences of consolidation at apices of lungs. 9. No tubercle bacilli in sputa. 10. No evidence of tubercle in body. From Typhlitis. — In typhoid fever there usually is typhlitis, and the problem to be solved is not. Is typhlitis present or not? but Is the typhlitis present a typhoid or a simple typhlitis 1 In typhoid fever constitutional symptoms usually precede the local ones, and the latter are not nearly so severe as in simple typhlitis, there being rarely much pain or vomiting ; in typhoid too the stools may be characteristic, and the rise of temperature is gradual and ac- companied by headache. The cutaneous erup- Acute Pulmonary Tuberculosis 1. Abrupt rise of temperature. 2. Epistaxis absent. 3. No splenic enlargement. 4. Pulse not dicrotic. 5. Prostration severe. 6. No roseolar eruption. 7. Widal's test negative. 8. Sometimes evidences of apical consolida- tion. 9. Tubercle bacilli in sputa. 10. May be tubercular deposits in glands, etc. tion of typhoid appears too late to be of use in the diagnosis, and too much stress must not be laid upon it if enemas have been given, as they are capable of producing a similar roseolous eruption. From Gastro-Enteritis.—Typhoid fever begins sometimes with repeated vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, abdominal pain, and fever simulating and no doubt being associated with gastro- enteritis. The temperature chart, enlargement of spleen, and eventually the rash will clear up the diagnosis, but it is not always possible to

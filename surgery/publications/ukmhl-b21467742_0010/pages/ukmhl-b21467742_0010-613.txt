YELLOW FEVER 597 Diagnosis.—Attention to the state of the spleen, and a careful examination of the blood and urine, taken along with the circumstances of place and the history of the case, will suffice to distinguish yellow fever from the bilious haemor- rhagic form of malaria and from hajmoglobinuric DAY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nouR E M E M M E M E M E E E lOS — I03 lOZ — lOI lOO \ V 99 98 97 96 V Chart i. fever, the only diseases with which it is likely to be confounded. Mortality and Prognosis.—The proportion of a susceptible population attacked varies greatly in different epidemics. The civil popula- tion of Gibraltar in 1804 numbered 14,000. Of these only 25 escaped, 12 of whom had already DAY 1 Z 3 5 6 7 8 HOUR E E M E E E M E E I05 lo4 I03 )oa lO" lOO 99 98 97 96 I s Chart 2. suffered from the disease. More commonly the diffusion of the infection is limited to the poorest and filthiest parts of a town. The case- mortality exhibits extraordinary extremes, vary- ing from \ per cent in New Orleans in 1897 to 87 per cent in the same city in 1853. The prognosis must thus have regard, in the first place, to the type of the prevailing epidemy. The age and nationality of the patient has also to be taken into consideration. A severe, long- continued chill, a high temperature, extreme irritability of the stomach, and, above all, scanty and albuminous urine, indicate a severe attack. A fall of the temperature below normal with signs of collapse, generalised hsemorrhages. 1 a 3 A s & 7 8 E r M M z /A E E E V - V V i \ A K > — Chart 3. suppression of urine in the second stage, are separately of the gravest import, and combined prognosticate a fatal issue. Prophylaxis. — The stamping out of the disease in its endemic foci is obviously an object of primary importance which has never been seriously taken in hand.

The low-lying districts of seaports within the yellow fever zone should be drained, surface pools and other collections of water dried, water-butts and cisterns covered, and every breeding-place of the culicidce abolished. Scarcely less important is the widen- ing and opening up of narrow streets and lanes

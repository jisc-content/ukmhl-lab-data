Under enforced vaccination, in spite of many evasions of the law, and of the great epidemic of 1871-72, the average mortality of the eighteen years ending in 1890 was 178 per million. The gradual steps of the decline are thus given by Dr. Farr :— 1838-53, Average mortality 1854-71, ,, ,. . 1872-90, ,, ,, . 514 per million. 388 ,, 178 In Scotland the rate of mortality from small- pox in the last eighteen years of the eighteenth century is believed to have been at least 4700 per million of population. From 1853 to 1864 vaccination was optional, the mortality rate was 340 per million. From 1865 to 1889 it was compulsory, and the rate came down to 80 per million. For the five years 1893-97 it has averaged 12. In Ireland during the same five years the rate has averaged 10 per million :— 18th century rate . . . 4700 per million. 1853-64, Vaccination optional . 340 ,, ,, 1865-89, ,, compulsory 80 ,, ,, 1893-97, Better administration of Vaccination Act . . 12 ,, Ireland, 1893-97 . . . 10 ,, ,, In France there was, up to February 1902, no compulsory vaccination law, but vaccination was indirectly encouraged by the Government. No official post could be taken without produc- ing a certificate of vaccination. Vaccination has been enforced for the French army since the year 1888. No statistics exist as to the total mortality from smallpox in the whole of France. The smallpox mortality of the large towns is known, and in these, with a population in 1892 of 8,000,000, 5670 lives were lost in the five years 1889-98, while in the same years Germany lost only 572 out of a population of 50,000,000. There have been no means of ascertaining the mortality from smallpox in the rural districts of France. The women and children and all defective male persons excused from service in the army have not been protected by any legal enactments in support of vaccination. Small- pox has been continually present in France, especially in the southern Departments. It is likely that the loss of life from smallpox among women and children has been an important factor in the absence of growth of population in France. In February 1902, however, France adopted compulsory vaccination in infancy, and revaccination in the eleventh and twenty-first years of life. If this law is properly administered, the condition of France with regard to smallpox ought speedily to be much improved. In Sweden, where registration of deaths dates from 1774, instead of as in England from 1837, the average for twenty-seven years before 1800 was 2008 deaths per million. With permissive vaccination the fifteen years' average from 1801 to 1815 was 631. With compulsory vaccination from 1816 to 1885 the seventy years' average was 173 per million; with increased care in en- forcing the law the rate during the four years 1893-96 was reduced to an average of 2'1.

In the years 1750 to 1800 the average smallpox mortality rate was 3567 per million. Vaccination was introduced in 1801, and it was extensively practised. It was permissive only, but the mortality rate fell to 660. The law for compulsory vaccination came into effect in 1810, and the average death- rate for the next sixty years was 130. For the years 1893-97 the average mortality from small- pox has been '5 per million for the whole of Denmark. In Prussia vaccination has been compulsory upon all recruits for the army since 1831. There was no law for the compulsory vaccination of infants till the year 1874. It was then enacted that every child should be vaccinated before the end of the year next after the year of its birth, so that in many cases it happened that the child was nearly two years old before it was vaccinated. Revaccination was at the same time made compulsory upon all children of school age ; and on joining the army the recruits were again revaccinated. Therefore, to argue that Prussia or any other kingdom of Germany had compulsory vaccination generally enforced before 1874 is worse than stupid ; it is a deliberate untruth. But the statement is still made from time to time in this country. From the date of the Act of 1874 smallpox has been extremely rare in the Prussian army. The smallpox mortality in the Prussian nation from 1865 to the end of 1874 averaged 755'4 per million; after the law of 1874 the average for the next ten years was 22•2. The great epidemic of 1871-72 no doubt brought up the mortality very considerably in the earlier decade, but even in non-epidemic years it was high, e.g. in 1865, 1866, 1867 it was respectively 438, 620, 432; while in 1877, 1878, 1879 it was reduced

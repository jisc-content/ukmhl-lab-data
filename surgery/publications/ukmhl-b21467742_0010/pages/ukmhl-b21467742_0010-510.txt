494 VITAL STATISTICS Determination of Longevity. — We have hitherto considered only death-rates, i.e. the numbers dying each year out of each 1000 of population. The mean duration of life involves another aspect of the same problem. Although nothing is more uncertain than the duration of individual life, the duration of life for the entire community is subject to so little variation that annuities and life assurance can be made the subject of exact calculations. Of the tests employed to measure the duration of human life the most commonly employed is the mean AGE AT DEATH. 1 T,, , 1 i 1 sum of aees at death . rni ■ Mean age at death = cr ——?r— i his ° number ot deaths is a fair method of stating the average longevity of a particular group of persons, if the group is sufficiently large to avoid the possible error caused by paucity of data (p. 496). But it would be entirely unsafe to assume that by this means a safe standard of comparison between two groups can be formed. Thus in 1890 it was stated that the mean age at death of work- men was twenty-nine to thirty years, of the well-to-do classes, fifty-five to sixty years. This statement throws no light on the relative vitality of the two classes under comparison. The well-to-do classes consist largely of those whose working days are past, and it is as untrustwoi'thy to compare their mean age at death with that of workmen as it would be to base any conclusion on the fact that the mean age at death of bishops is much higher than that of curates. The mean age at death is lowest in countries with a high birth-rate. Hence it would be very fallacious to compare the mean age at death in England and France. The PROBABLE duration of life {vie probable) is a term sometimes employed to denote the age at which any number of children born into the world will be reduced to one-half. In practice it can only be ascertained from a life-table (p. 495). The true mean duration of life, or expectation of life, can only be ascertained from a Life- Table, and this must therefore be briefly described. This is the true biometer, of equal importance in all inquiries connected with human life with the barometer or thermometer and similar instruments employed in physical research. The life-table represents "a genera- tion of individuals passing through time." The data required for its construction are the number and ages of the living, and the number and ages of the dying, i.e. the data required for ascertaining the death-rate for each year of life. Theoretically the best plan for forming a life- table would be to observe a million children, all born on the same day, through life, entering in a column (headed (,,) the number who remain alive at the end of each successive year, until 1 There is no general agreement as to the exact sense in which the words average and mean should be used. They are used here interchangeably. all have died, and in a second column (headed c?,.) the number dying before the completion of each year of life. This method is impractic- able, and were it otherwise the experience would be obsolete before it could be utilised. The method employed in constructing the national life-tables for England is, without tracing the history of individuals through life, to assume that the population being given by the census returns, and the death-rates for each age for a given decennium being known, that the same death-rates will continue during the remainder of the lives of the population included in the census returns. The total mean number living and the total number dying for a given age-period are known. The mean chance {p^) of living one year during this age-period is found by the fraction : Population - ^ deaths _ Population + ^ deaths It is usual to start with a million or 100,000 children at birth, and to make a separate table for the proportionate number of males and females at birth. Thus, in Brighton in 1881- 90, these were in the proportion of 51,195 and 48,805. Starting with 51,195 male infants at birth, and multiplying this number by "84608, the probability of surviving for one year, we obtain 51,195 x -84608 =■ 43,315. For the second year of life the probability of surviving was •93398; hence the number of survivors is 43,315 X-93398 = 40,452; and so on. The general arrangement is shown in the following example of a life-table, which only gives the data at or near the two extremes of life, the intermediate figures having been omitted from considerations of space :— Brighton Life-Table.—Males {Based on the Mortality of the 10 Years, 1881-90.)

VENTILATION AND WARMING 436 per 10,000, and the discomfort or ill-effects due to cold draughts, or to excessive radiation of body-heat to cold objects in the room. The excessive radiation of body-heat to cold solid objects, or to objects persistently cooled by evaporation from moist surfaces, or to thin ex- posed walls, or to windows, is as important a cause of discomfort as exposure to draughts. If the solid objects in a room are warm, cold draughts are easily tolerated, and may be even pleasant. Radiation is, of course, independent of air-currents; heat rays pass, like light, in straight lines in all directions equally from the centre of radiation, and are absorbed or reflected according to circumstances. Hence the necessity of combining ventilation with warming, not necessarily with warming of the air, but with warming of the solid objects. If the body is clothed in good non-conducting clothes, and the room-objects are warm, cold air is not injurious. The "open-air" treatment of phthisis is a standing demonstration of this. It may be called treatment by large draughts. It is, however, for ordinary life, in limited spaces, difficult to provide without discomfort the requisite quantity of air, which increases with work. Thus an adult male during work requires 9800 cubic feet of air per hour ; during repose, 3600 cubic feet: an adult female, in repose, requires 3000 cubic feet; a child, in repose, 2000 cubic feet. In practice, less than this must be accepted. Morin lays down the following approximations :— Amounts of Air necessary per Person per Hour Hospitals (ordinary) . 2000 to 2400 cub. ft. per hr. ,, (epidemic) . 5000 ,, ,, ,, Workshops (ordinary) . 2000 ,, ,, ,, " " " 3500 ,, 1700 1400 to 1700 1000 ,, 2000 400 ,, 500 800 ,, 1000 (unhealthy) Prisons Theatres Meeting Halls Schools (per child) ,, (per adult) Haldane recommends for factories and work- shops a maximum standard of 12 volumes COg per 10,000 volumes of air where no gas is used, and 20 per 10,000 where gas in used. To secure this standai-d, 1250 cubic feet of air per hour per person must be supplied. He bases this estimate on the fact that about 1 cubic foot CO2 per hour is produced by a man at work. He has found that even in very badly ventilated workshops the amount of COg rarely surpasses 50 volumes per 10,000, and that it takes six times this amount to interfere seriously with respiration. Professor Thorpe {see Jacob's Ventilation and Warming, p. 14) found in a sitting-room, near floor, 7'33 CO., per 10,000; half-way up, 9; near ceiling, 14-65. In the Grand Theatre, Leeds: pit, 15-01 ; upper circle, 14-29; balcony, 14-16. In the Philosophical Hall, after lecture, 13-38. Professor Clowes, in Nottingham {ibid. pp. 14, 15), found in the chemical laboratory of University College, 6*9 ; in the grounds of the College, 4-3; in the Masonic Hall during a dance, 31 ; in the Circus, 32-6 ; in a committee-i'oom with 15 persons and 27 gas-jets, 41-8. Dr. Angus Smith, in three Manchester mills, found (1) with 400 people, 28-6; (2) with same number, 29-6 ; (3) with same number, 30. Recent results confirm these analyses. Cubic Space.—If the impurities of each ex- piration could be instantly removed, and fresh air supplied directly for each inspiration, the amount of cubic space for inhabited rooms would be of little moment. But the expired impurities diffuse rapidly through the surrounding atmo- sphere, and the only mode of keeping them down to respirable limits is to dilute them freely with fresh air. To do this without draughts is diffi- cult in a small space. Hence a minimum space compatible at once with fresh air and comfort must be fixed. For dwelling-houses, this cannot be fixed precisely; but the standard for common lodging-houses, namely, 400 cubic feet per bed, may be applied to individual houses. The following table indicates the amount of space required by statute, or order, or otherwise found desirable for various types of building :— Minijnum Floor Space and Cubic Space in various Buildings Floor space Cubic space in sq. ft. in cub. ft. per bed. per bed.

All the above quantities presuppose the most adequate ventilation. Floor space is very important: (a) because it is essential to manage- ment ; {b) because it minimises contacts in in- fection. Height should not exceed 14 feet, unless there is a ceiling ventilator; a greater height tends to cool the fouled and heated air, and thus cause it to re-mix with the air of the room. Where gas is freely burned, the heat of

VENTILATION AND WARMING 434 Nitrogen.—For respiration, nitrogen is inert; but it forms a diluting vehicle for the oxygen, which, if breathed in concentration, produces symptoms of excitement. Carbon Dioxide, or Carbonic Acid. — For ventilation, this is always an impurity; but in the small percentages present in average air it is harmless. In normal air it varies from less than 3 to more than 6 parts per 10,000 volumes. Haldane states that the results by Pettenkofer's method are usually too high by about 0'5 parts per 10,000 volumes of air. In open country, Haldane has found that CO2 varies from 3-5 volumes by night in summer per 10,000 volumes of air to 2'6 volumes by day in the lower strata in consequence of the influence of vegetation. In dry air the amount of C0„ in the open country in Scotland is amost exactly 3*0 parts per 10,000 volumes. This result Haldane gives as the average of a series of exact determinations. In 29 analyses made between 1st April and 30th September, he found a day maximum of 3'11 parts per 10,000 volumes, a day minimum of 2-58—average, 2'88. In 23 analyses he found a night maximum of 3'55, a night minimum of 2'82—average, 3-08. Average of night and day analyses, 2'98. In 6 analyses made between December and January, he found a day maxi- mum of 3'12, a day minimum of 2'93—average, 2- 99. In 5 analyses he found a night maximum of 3'06, a night minimum of 2'94—average, 3- 01. Average of night and day, 3-00. In London air the COg varies from 4'5 in clear air to 14-1 in a fog. Analyses made by Dr. Russell during 1882-83 gave an average of 4"01. Probably a more correct average is 3'7. Fogs should be avoided at the time of estimation. Organic Matter.—This includes micro-organ- isms, organic dust, organic effluvia of un- ascertained composition, organic gases. The amount depends on local conditions and on respiration. The hypothesis that the deleteri- ous effect of air from an overcrowded room is due to a particular poisonous organic substance is not borne out by recent analysis (Haldane). Aqueous Vapour.—For ventilation and warm- ing, aqueous vapour is not unimportant. A very moist atmosphere favours dampness of walls, with consequent chilling; a very dry atmosphere, especially if warmed, causes dis- comfort. This is probably due to the absorp- tion of moisture from skin and mucous surfaces. Dry air, also, by increasing the rate of evapora- tion, chills damp objects in a room. To prevent discomfort when air is artificially warmed, the " humidity should not be less than 60 per cent of saturation" (Shaw). Saturation depends, not on the absolute amount of aqueous vapour in the given quantity of air, but on the tempera- ture of the air. Thus 1-1 grain of aqueous vapour saturates a cubic foot of air at 10° Fahr.; but at 50° Fahr. it takes 4-2 grains to saturate the same quantity of air; at 60° Fahr., 5-8 grains; at 80° Fahr., 10-7 grains; at 100° Fahr., 19-1 grains ; at 130° Fahr., 42-5 grains. In all these cases the percentage of humidity is 100, which means saturation. It follows that if, for example, air at 60° Fahr. contains only 2'9 grains of aqueous vapour per cubic foot- that is half its saturation quantity at that temperature—it is less humid than air at 10° Fahr. when this contains in each cubic foot only I'l grain, which at that temperature is satura- tion. The amount of aqueous vapour in the air, either in rooms or in the open, can be estimated very precisely by various hygro- meters, e.g. the wet and dry bulb thermometers. The humidity of the air conditions, to a large extent, the variations and effects of tempera- ture. A moist air secures greater uniformity of climate. In Britain, owing to the greater humidity, lower temperatures in warming of houses can be tolerated than in America, which is relatively dry. Billings states that in America, to secure comfort, rooms must be kept at a temperature of 68° Fahr. to 70° Fahr.; in England, comfort is secured at 60° Fahr. The amount of aqueous vapour in inhabited rooms varies more or less as the amount of respiratory impurity, and this fact has been made the basis of a method for estimating the impurity. But, as a rule, the amount of aqueous vapour varies so rapidly from hour to hour that, except in great excess of impurity, the relation of impurity to vapour is too inconstant to be a reliable index. Second, Organismal Pollutions—Respiration. —In parts per cent, the difference between inspired and expired air is, according to Foster, as follows:— Oxygen. Nitrogen. Carbonic Acid. Inspired air contains . 20-94 79-15 -03 to "04 Expired air contains . 16-033 79-581 4-38 The quantities for inspired air differ slightly from the latest averages, but are sufficiently accurate. Thus the expired air contains from 4 to 5 per cent less of oxygen and some 4 per cent more of carbonic acid. At the rate of 25 cubic inches (tidal air) each respiration and 17 respirations a minute, a man will, in an hour, pollute 102,000 cubic inches to the extent of 1 per cent (volume) of COj, which means an excretion of 0-6 cubic foot CO2 per hour. This quantity approximates to the theoretically expected result of food-metabolism, and has been verified by experiment. But average air contains "03 to -04 CO2 per 100, or 0-3 to 0-4 per 1000 volumes. Consequently, if a man breathes for an hour in a room of 1000 cubic feet (10 ft. X 10 ft. X 10 ft.), the amount of COg at the end of the hour, if no air is admitted or withdrawn meanwhile, will be 0-6-f 0-4 = 1*0 cubic foot. But air containing this amount of COo due to respiration is unwholesome, and must be diluted until the total COg does not

VITAL STATISTICS 495 each lived a complete year in the first year, or among them 43,315 years. Similarly, the 40,452 males will live among them 40,452 further complete years, and so on, until all the males started with become extinct at the age of 105. Evidently, therefore, the total number of complete years lived by the 51,195 males started with at birth will be 43,315 + 40,452 + 39,456 + 38,723+ . . . +10 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 2,206,174 years ; this simi being obtained by adding together the numbers living at each age beyond {i.e. below on the table) the age in question right down to its last item. This number of years is lived by 51,195 males. Hence the number of complete years lived by, i.e. the expectation of life of each male— 2,206,174 = — = 43 '09 years. 51,196 ^ This is the curtate expectation of life. It deals only with the complete years of life, not taking into account that portion of lifetime lived by each person in the year of his death, which may be assumed to be, on a average, half a year. Hence the complete expectation of life, according to the above table, is 43-59 years. In the following table the expectation of life (complete) for various towns and for England is given:— Life-Table,—Expectation of Life at Birth. Males. Females.

Willich's Formula is as follows :—If x = expectation of life, and a = present age, then— a,- = |80-a). Thus at the age of fifty years the expecta- tion of life, according to this formula, is twenty years. By the English life-table for 1881-90 it was 18-82 for males, and 20-56 for females. Fare's Formula is based on the birth- and death-rates :—If b = birth-rate, and d = death- rate per unit of population, then— ^2 Thus Expectation of life = ^? x i ^ -f Q x ^ j . 30-3 b for England and Wales, 1889-98 = ~g= -0303 and 1000' . 18;4 ' 1000 = •0184.

This is only true for a stationary or life-table popula- tion, in which the number dying is assumed to be regularly replaced by a corresponding number of persons of the same age. Life-Capital.—The life-tables now in use are those based on the experience of 1881-90. The gain in any subsequent year, as in 1900, may be ascertained as follows:—The mean popula- tion and the death-rate for each age-group, as 0-5, 5-10, etc., are calculated. Then the mean death-rate of the same community for 1881-90 is applied to this population. By this means the "calculated number" of deaths in 1900 is obtained. The difference between these numbers and the "actual number" obtained from the death-registers gives the gain or loss during the year. Next multiply these differences by the mean expectation of life for the corresponding groups of years. By adding the gains thus ascertained, and subtracting any losses, we obtain the net gain in " life-capital " (Tatham) during the year 1900. Tests of the Health of a Community.— 1. The general death-rate is the test most com- monly applied and generally trusted. It has its limitations in this respect. It may usually be trusted in comparing a town or district for a single year with preceding years, as the age and sex distribution of a given population only change slowly. But when comparison with other towns or districts is made, the possibility that erroneous conclusions may be drawn be- comes considerable, {a) Before the death-rates of two districts can be compared, either this comparison must be made by means of death- rates for age-groups (0-5, 5-10 . . . 65-75, etc., etc.), or the factor of correction, the method of obtaining which is described on p. 491, must be applied, (b) It must be ensured that in the two compared districts an equal amount of cor- rection has been made for deaths occurring in public institutions and among visitors (p. 490). (c) Even when the above precautions are taken it is conceivable that a town with a death-rate of 15 per 1000 may really be as healthy as another with a death-rate of 12 per 1000, though a statistical justification of this statement is a difficult task. Social conditions, quite irrespec- tive of the sanitary condition or the natural salubrity of a district, have an important in- fluence on the death-rate. Poverty, and all that it denotes, necessarily involves a higher death-rate than occurs among the well-to-do. Furthermore, the domestic servants employed by the latter frequently die in districts other than those in which they are employed, without

Toxicology, the science which treats of poisons, comprises a description of the nature and constitution of poisons, the symptoms and post- mortem appearances produced by them, the treatment of poisoning, and the physiological and chemical tests by means of which poisons may be recognised. To the medical practitioner the most important of these are the symptoms, treatment, and post-mortem appearances; conse- quently, in this epitome they will receive the chief consideration. It is difficult to accurately define the word poison, inasmuch as almost any substance, that is not absolutely inert, may produce injurious effects if taken in excessive amount, when it would come under the definition of a poison; yet such substances are included in the prepara- tion of ordinary food, as, for example, nutmeg. A practical definition of a poison may be thus formulated: a poison is a substance which, either by being absorbed into the living organ- ism, or by its chemical action on the tissues, injures health and destroys life. Among the conditions which have to be taken into account when estimating the injurious effects which may be produced by poisons are: age, idiosyncrasy,, habit, and state of health, together with the physical condition and the mode of administra- tion of the poison. The susceptibility of infants, and children to opium and the exceptional in- tolerance of adults towards certain drugs—such as arsenic, quinine, or mercury—are well known.. The habitual use of opium produces an un- wonted tolerance towards it, as does also the presence of diseases such as delirium tremens and tetanus. The physical condition and the

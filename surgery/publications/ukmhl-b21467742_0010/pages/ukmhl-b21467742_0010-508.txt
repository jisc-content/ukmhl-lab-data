The total number of deaths thus calculated is 1572 in a population of 95,420, and the total death- rate =16-47 per 1000. This is the standard death-rate, i.e. the death-rate at all ages, calcu- lated on the hypothesis that the rates at each of twelve age-periods in Huddersfield were the same as in England and Wales during the ten years of the last intercensal period for which the information is available, viz. 19-15 in 1881-90. But the standard death-rate of Huddersfield would have been 19-15, instead of 16-47, were it not for the fact that the distribution of age and sex in the Huddersfield population is more favourable than in the country as a whole. Hence it must be in- creased in the ratio of 19-15 : 16-47, i.e. multiplied by the factor ^^= 1-1627. When the crude or recorded death-rate for 1900 of 16-78 is multiplied by this factor we obtain the corrected death-rate of 16-78 x 1-1627 = 19-51 per 1000, which is the correct figure to compare with the death-rate of 18-31 for England and Wales in that year. If the death-rate of England and Wales be stated as 1000, then 1000x 19-51 incc • —jg.gj— = lUDO, IS the comparaUve mortality figure for Huddersfield. Similarly, in the year 1900 the comparative mortality figure of Salford 1541. In all the towns, except Ply- mouth and Norwich, the corrected death-rate is higher than the crude or recorded death-rate. This implies that in all except these two towns the factor of correction is greater than unity. This is a convenient point for briefly dis- cussing the RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BIRTH- RATE AND DEATH-RATE. The Opinion is com- monly held that a high birth-rate is a direct cause of a high death-rate, owing to the great mortality among infants. Table I. shows that the death-rate at ages under five is three times as high as at all ages together, and it is there- fore natural to suppose that a high birth-rate, by producing an excessive proportion of persons of tender years, will cause a high general death- rate. This might be so if the birth-rate was to remain high for only five years. But if the high birth-rate continued longer the proportion of the total population at ages of low mortality would be increased, and the general death-rate be lowered. We have already seen that in nearly all the great towns, in which the birth- rate is higher than in rural districts, the age distribution of the population is more favour- able to a low death-rate than in rural districts, and their relatively high crude death-rate is made still higher than that of rural districts when the necessary factor of correction is applied. The INFANTILE MORTALITY should be stated in terms of the infantile population. This is more accurately assumed to be equal to the number of births in the given year than estimated from the number stated to be under one year of age at the last census. The number of deaths

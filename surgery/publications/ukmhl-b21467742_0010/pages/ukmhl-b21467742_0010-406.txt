390 VACCINATION to 3, 7, and 13 respectively. There was a slight increase in 1880, 1881, and 1882, when for two years the rate was 36, but how small is this compared with the rates of the previous decade, when twice only was it under 150. The exact figures are shown in the following table :— Prussia—Before the Law of 1874.

Their splendid vaccination system, with twenty- five State Institutions for supplying calf-lymph, was not brought to its present high standard at once after the law was passed; it had to be created and to be gradually developed. The ten years 1885 to 1894 show these rates: — Prussia.

The first was that of a reservist who had been twice unsuccessfully vaccinated in the army.^ Statistics for all Germany do not begin till 1886. Steady improvement is shown in the smallpox mortality rates per million, year by year, from 1886 to 1899, i.e. for fourteen years. 1 V. r. Smallpo.v in England and other Countries, p. 35. E. J.

Is it possible to doubt, after studying these figures, the value of a strict law both for vacci- nation and revaccination, and of ceaseless en- deavour after perfection in the administration of the law 1. Attempts are made by the opponents of vaccination to attribute the remarkable results of the law of 1874, and of the administrative improvements which have been gradually made in Prussia since that date, to stricter isolation, which they say began in 1883. No reason- able person doubts the value of the isolation of smallpox patients. Professor Koch spoke highly of it before the German Vaccination Commission of 1884, but the official Report of the Commission, issued in 1885, mentions no new law of isolation, nor does the volume on vaccination issued by the Imperial Health Office, Berlin, in 1896. It is, however, possible that some administrative improvements were made in favour of stricter isolation without any change in the law. Of this, however, no evidence can be quoted. When Germans are asked how isolation is carried out in their country in cases of smallpox, the answer is to the effect that they do not know, as there is no smallpox in Germany. This is not strictly correct, but it shows that in Germany epidemics are not so much arrested by isolation as prevented by efficient revaccination. The Report of the German Commission on Vaccination gives the following table, showing the relative mortality from smallpox per 100,000 population over nine years, betw^een Dresden with compulsory vaccination and revaccination, and Prague with no compulsory vaccination :— Year.

Since 1891 sharp super- vision has been exercised in its support, especially as to vaccination or revaccination at school age. The average mortality for the five years 1877 to 1881 was 619 per million; for the four years

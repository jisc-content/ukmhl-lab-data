EDITORIAL NOTE vii the test of time and which may now be fairly regarded as permanent additions to the common store of medical and surgical means of diagnosis and treatment. Transient phases of opinion and unsuccessful modes of treatment (however much vaunted on their introduction) will be very shortly dealt with. The Quinquennium, therefore, will be something more than a record of the work of five years in medicine : it will attempt to place new methods and new views in their proper perspective; it will endeavour to distinguish between what is new and of value and what is only novel. To attain this end special subjects have been placed in the hands of those who are specially qualified to deal with them, and estimates rather than abstracts have been asked for. It is confidently anticipated that the readers of the Encyclopedia and Dictionary will find in the Quinquennium a useful supplementary volume to the former work, and a trustworthy guide to the really important additions which the past five years have made to our means of combating disease, deformity, and death. 24 Melville Street, Edinburgh.

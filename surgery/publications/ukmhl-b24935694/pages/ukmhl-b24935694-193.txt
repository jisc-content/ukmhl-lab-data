The feminal difcharges had been attended with extreme pain, fo great as almoft to pro- duce fainting, before the ftate of the proftate had been relieved : they afterwards took place without any unufual fenfation.

They induced me to pay particular attention to the ftate of that part of the urethra; which at- tention will, in my opinion, be found of great confequence in diredling our treatment of thefe diforders.

i66 ON DISEASES of mercury; yet, when the conftitution of the patient is weak, it is ufeful to give me- dicines of a tonic and cordial kind. This pradtice is peculiarly proper, when it re- quires a more powerful operation of mer- cury than I have in general defcribed, to control and cure urgent fymptoms. * Such is the refult of the obfervations I have made on the treatment of thefe moft * It may be thought by fome, that I have relied too much in the treatment of the foregoing difeafes, upon the internal adminiftration of mercury, and have not fufficiently tried its effects by inun£tion. I therefore think it right to ex- plain, that it feems to me immaterial, whether a mild oxyd of mercury, fuch as fhould be contained in mercurial oint- ment, and quickfilver pills, is abforbed from the Ikin or the alimentary canal. I generally find that as much of the quickfilver pill can be taken internally as is neceflary to produce the degree of mercurial afFe&ion of the fyftem, which is requifite for the cure of pfeudo-fyphilitic fymp- toms, without in the lead disordering the funftions of the digeftive organs; but on the contrary, with evident benefit by exciting and maintaining the natural and healthy actions of thofe organs. It is right, however, to add, that the pilul: hydrarg: which I have always employed, has been procured from the Apothecaries’ Hall; and that when it has been ob- tained from other places, its effe£ts have by no means correfponded to what I have reprefented of them, either in this, or the preceding volume. vex-

RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 3 duced on the genitals, by fexual intercourfe, which are not the effedts of the venereal poifon, and that many of them infedt the conftitu- tion, and produce fecondary fymptoms refem- bling thofe of that diforder. It may be afked, however, if thefe difeafes be not vene- real, what are they? As they are all the confequence of fexual intercourfe, they may, in one fenfe of the word, be faid to*be vene- real. To avoid ambiguity, therefore, I fhall in thefe pages denominate that difeafe which broke out at the fiege of Naples, and which Mr. Hunter has defcribed as the venereal difeafe, by the name given to it by nofological writers, that is. Syphilis ; and I fhall call thofe difeafes, which differ from it in their progrefs and mode of becoming well, though they ftrikingly refemble it in appear- ance, by a name importing thefe circum- ftances, that is, Pfeudo-Syphilitic Difeafes. To prepare the mind of the reader to take an impartial furvey of thefe fubjedts, I think it will be ufeful to make a few preliminary obfervations relative to the probable origin of pfeudo-fyphilitic difeafes. b 2 Celfus

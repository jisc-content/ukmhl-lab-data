I38 ON DISEASES thefe complaints gradually difappeared. His health, however, was ftill difordered, and new fymptoms came on. His nofe became flightly affedted, and he had pains in his bones. He now removed to the fea-fide, and after continuing there for a confiderable time, he wrote to me, faying, that ulceration had taken place in his nofe, which had de- flroyed the feptum narium, and that the in- teguments, covering a kind of node on one fhin, had formed into a foul and fretful fore. I now recommended an alterative mercurial courfe. He took five grains of pil: hydrarg: at night, and a pint of the decoct: farfae daily, and in the courfe of four or five weeks he was apparently well, having ac- quired health and ftrength at the fame time. In a lecond letter he exprefled his great fur- prize at his amendment, and wiihed for my further diredtions. I then defired he would take the pil: hydrarg: every fecond night, it the ftate of the biliary fecretion required it; but as that was not the cafe he took no more of that medicine, and has fincc remained perfectly well.

OF THE URETHRA, &C. 185 The CASE IV, A gentleman, about fixty years of age, was affedted with dyfury, which increafed with violence, though various means were em- ployed during two years for his relief. He voided his urine every fecond hour, or oftener, with great pain and fevere irritation ; which continued for fome time after its expulfion. He had fuch a fenfation of heat and uneafi- nefs in the perinaeum, that he could not bear to bring his thighs together; and he was obliged to ufe a culhion, with a vacancy in the middle, when he fat down. He could not ride in a carriage, or even walk out, al- though his general health was good. A moderate-fized bougie halted a little at two ftridtures, and when it arrived at the proftate produced a violent burning fenfation, a vehe- ment propenfity to void the urine, and extreme pain at about two inches from the orifice of the urethra; which part was always particu- larly painful during the time of voiding the urine, and after its expulfion. On withdraw- ing the bougie, which had entered the bladder, its point was foipid to be covered with blood.

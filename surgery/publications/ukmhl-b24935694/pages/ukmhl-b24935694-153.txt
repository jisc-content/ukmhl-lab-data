RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 147 every inftance produce conftitutional fymp- toms. Apprized of their nature I generally order for the patients that dofe of mercury, A which may be taken without affeCting the conftitution, as a difcutient of the hardnefs, and I have known nearly fix months elapfe before it has been completely difperfed. This kind of partial induration is fo different from the progrefs of true fyphilis, that I think it mull be readily granted not to be of that nature. It mull however be alfo re- membered, that fores which indurate in all parts are not always fyphilitic. As I have already related two inftances I think it un- neceffary to add more. Having thus endeavoured to reprefent the conftitutional effects refulting from fores, which differ materially in their characters and progrefs from fyphilitic chancres, I wifh to fubjoin another cafe, though I am doubtful whether the difeafe originated from infedtion, or was the product of conftitu- tional diforder. I think it deferves to be recorded on account of its duration. L 2 In rl

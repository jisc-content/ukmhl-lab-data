*5° ON DISEASES on the left parietal bone, but of lefs fize, had broken and healed. There was alfo a very confiderable node near the top of the left tibia, which had been opened by cauftic, and had left a foul ulcer. I then recom- mended the decodh farfse with a compound calomel pill, night and morning. This plan was continued from November to the end of May, when the decoction was left off, though the pill was continued in a fmalier dofe for fome time longer. Under this courfe, which never produced the flighted: mercurial effedt on the confutation, all thefe complaints got well, and the patient became healthy and fat, and, as he fays, better than he has been from the commencement of his dif- orders which is fourteen years ago. This cafe appears to me to be very fimilar to that related at page 87.

Whild I was attending this patient, his wife’s throat ulcerated to a confiderablfr degree.

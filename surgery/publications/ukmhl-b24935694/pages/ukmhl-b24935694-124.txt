118 ON DISEASES CASE XVII. A gentleman had a, trivial fore upon the prepuce, and being engaged to marry in the courfe of a few months, he underwent what was considered as a more than adequate courfe of mercury, for the cure of the difeafe. After he had married, however, his throat ulcerated. His furgeon hefitated in pro- nouncing it to be fyphilitic, and its progrefs contra-indicated that fuppofition, for one fore healed and another broke out, or ulcera- tion again enfued in the fame place. One of the tefles afterwards became conliderably en- larged without pain, and fores broke out upon the fcrotum, which was much thickened, and in the perinseum. Six or more months palfed during the progrefs of the difeafe to this flate, when I was firft confulted on the cafe. It was in the fpring of the year, and we agreed vated by the moft powerful effects of mercury. The cafes above recited, I therefore deem worthy attention as they lhew that difeafes refembling fyphilis may occur in the nofe as well as elfewhere ; and that our pra&ice Ihould be regulated by the fame principles in treating thefe, as in other fymptoms of venereal difeafes. that

RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 53 have given a little calomel for tha iurpole, but not fo as to invalidate the opinion that the difeafe was not fyphilitic. Having waited, for inftance, four months from the occur- rence of a fore throat with eruptions, and being allured by the progrefs of the dif- orders that they were not fyphilitic, I have diredted that the compound calomel pills* fhould be taken in fuch dofes as to control the difeafe without weakening the conftitu- tion, which generally difpofes the fores in the throat to heal, but I have taken care to remit the ufe of even this fmall quantity of mer- cury if it feemed to heal the fores too fpeedilyj for it feems to me better to let the difeafe exhauft itfelf than fuddenly to cure it, as in the latter cafe it is very likely to return. In confirmation of this opinion I may men- tion, that, about five years ago, a gentleman applied to me to undergo a falivation for the cure of a fore throat, for which he had been falivated three times, once in each fucceeding * The pill, as preferred in the pharmacopeia of St.Bar- tholomewâ€™s HofpitajL contains I grain of calomel, i grain of the precipitated fulphur of antimony, and 2 grains of powdered gum guaiacum, combined by foap.

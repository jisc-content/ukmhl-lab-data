ON DISEASES 64 to me, in the prefent ftate of our know- ledge of thefe difeafes, to be judicious. One advantage refults from this plan of conduct, which is, that if conftitutional fymptoms follow from a fore treated in a manner that ought to have prevented contamination of the habit had the fore been fyphilitic, our fuf- picions are excited, and by attentive obfer- vation we may perhaps difcover that the fymptoms are of another nature. In cafes of anomalous fores it may be en- quired, if in thofe, where the event renders it probable that they were of a fyphilitic na- ture, the difeafe deviates materially from its common characters, that of an ulcerative procefs without reparation, and extending in every direction. Do thefe fores enlarge by floughing, or produce granulation or fungus ? Do they fpread otherwife than nearly equally in their whole circumference ? Does the ulceration extend in them only in parti- cular directions ? Do they heal in one part and fpread in another ? or do they fuddenly amend and become worfe without an ade- quate mercurial influence to produce fuch 7 changes ?

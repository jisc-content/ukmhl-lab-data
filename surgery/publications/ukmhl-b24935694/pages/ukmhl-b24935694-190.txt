184 ON DISEASES where it paffes through the proftate, and that it may render the bladder irritable, and produce ftridture in the urethra; for in this , cafe there was no mechanical obftrudtion to the expulfion of the urine to produce irrita- . tion in the bladder. It alfo appears, that the â€¢ difeafe admitted of relief by the introduction of a bougie. I have lately met with another cafe in a younger man, who is between twenty and thirty years of age, and who was afflicted with fimilar fits of dyfury, the caufe of which could not be afcertained. I palled a bougie : for him a few times, but found no ftridture in . the urethra. The fame painful fenfations were produced in the proftate, as in the pre- ceding cafes. The bougie did not appear at the time to relieve the dyfury ; but the com- plaint gradually ceafed, and the patient left town. He has been much better fince this time, and attributes his relief to the paffage of the bougie. CASE

It was of a circular form, with a thickened edge and bafe; there were no granulations, and matter adhered to the fur- face. For this, he took mercurial pills in large quantities, which never affedted his mouth, though occafionally they produced griping * It is not my intention to republilh the cafes in proof of this fa£t, becaufe I think that the prefent one is fuf- ficient to evince its truth.

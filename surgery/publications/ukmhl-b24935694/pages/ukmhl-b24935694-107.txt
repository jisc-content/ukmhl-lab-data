RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 101 i irritable and weak, and produces a more evident and confiderable diforder of particu- â–  lar organs. Such an affedtion cures com- pletely and radically fyphilitic difeafes; whilft others, which had been checked and cured by a flight mercurial affecfion, often increafe j and break out again, under that which is ; greater in degree. This violent adfion of mercury never fails to weaken and diforder the conftitution in general; and thus, with its powers impaired, and its fundfions de- ranged, it has ftill to endure the continuance of the difeafe. The cafes, which I fhall now bring for- ward, are feledfed, becaufe I think they ihew as great a variety of circumftances incidental to thefe difeafes, as could be dis- played in an equal number of examples. I could have crowded the book with inftances, tending more diredtly to illuflrate and con- firm the opinions delivered in it. My objedt has, however, been, not to reprefent the fubjedt as more clear than it will appear in pradlice. h 3 CASE

ON DISEASES 2o6 i duringfuch various complaints; and I repeat, that I have known fuch dyfury lead to actual,difeafe of the affedted organs. It is very common for men, who have been mar- ried many years, and who perhaps never had gonorrhoea (or if they had in their youth, it is probable that it had left no diforder in the canal of the urethra,) to gradually acquire, as they advance in life, difeafes of the urinary organs. Surely, then, the origin of fuch difeafes muft be regarded as fpontaneous, and likely to be induced and maintained by whatever occafions irritation in the affedled organs. There is, however, no period of life exempt from this kind of dyfury. Children are fre- quently much affedted by it, and at that age when the bodily powers are generally in the greateft vigour, if they become difordered, dyfury occurs in common with other difeafes. I have mentioned in the firft part of thefe obfervations, in fpeaking of the conftitutional origin of local difeafes, that I have known dyfury of this defeription.

RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 163 any relapfe ffiould occur, the difeafe could not be fyphilitic, or curable by fuch a courfe of mercury. The cafes to which I allude were thofe of officers and perfons of ftrong conftitutions, in which it feemed neceffary to eftabliffi this faÂ£t, with a view to the fubfe- quent treatment of any fymptoms that might occur. Yet in thefe cafes new fymptoms were manifefted. I have alfo been frequently con- fulted with refpect to the degree to which a mer- curial courfe ffiould be carried, and the time it ffiould be continued, that had been inftituted for the cure of pfeudo-fyphilitic fymptoms, which had been miftaken for thofe of true fy- philis; and I have recommended that it fliould be continued, to that degree and for that dura- tion, that fhould render a repetition of it un- necelfary, by proving it to be unavailing, ffiould a recurrence of fymptoms enfue. Yet in thefe cafes alfo, either the fame fymptoms returned or fimilar difeafes took place, and in moft inftances thefe returning fymptoms have got well without the ufe of mercury. The cafes alfo, which I have detailed, fhew how unavailing the mold potent courfes of mer- cury are, in effecting the radical cure of thefe m 2 diforders.

ON DISEASES 7 2 difeafe. This gentleman was liable to have fores break out fpontaneoufly on the pre- puce : they got well readily by bathing them with a weak folution of zincum vitriolatum j and I believe that perfons who have naturally an irritable ffate of the prepuce are moll: ob- noxious to fuch affections. We muff not, however, impute the occurrence of thefe pe- culiar fores to mere irritability, but to fome fpecific contagion. The difcharge from the urethra in fuch cafes is not considerable, nor attended with much inflammation or chordee, nor does it increafe in violence j it may therefore be eafily diftinguifhed from common gonorrhaea and its varieties. Sometimes, in a common gonorrhaea, the difeafe Shifts its ground and attacks the fore- fkin, and fores form about the orifice of this part. Thefe are of a different nature from the fores which I have been defcribing; their furface is generally gloffy, not producing ex- uberant new flefh, and their colour is un- healthy.

In doubtful cafes, which are cured by exciting the mercurial adfion in the conftitution, he would adopt a ftmilar mode of treatment, in order to fupprefs the dif- eafe for fo long a time as to make it lefs likely to recur; or if any fubfequent difeafe fhould take place, to render it highly pro- bable that this was not fyphilitic, fince it had broken out after fuch a courfe of mercury as muft be confidered to be adequate to the cure of almoft any difeafe of that nature. By undertaking this talk I lhall perhaps com- ply with the wilhes of my other friends, in ftating -more explicitly the circumftances which fhould induce a furgeon immediately to ufe or abftain from the adminiftration of mercury, and, at the fame time, contri- bute my mite of obfervation to thofe al- ready offered on this ftill obfcure fubjedt of â€¢venereal difeafes.

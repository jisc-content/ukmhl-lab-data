RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 63 have reafon to believe, that the conftitutional mercurial affection which has fubverted the local adtions of the difeafe, will have prevented its contamination by any matter that may have been imbibed from it. If then we may, for the reafons above ftated, employ mercury without hefitation in primary infedled fores, being governed with refpedt to the degree and duration of its ufe by its effedts, we ought, as has been fhewn in the preceding part of this chapter, to purfue the reverfe con- dudl with refpedt to conftitutional fymp- toms. Here we are required to hefitate, that we may learn the nature of the difeafe pre- vious to attempting its cure* It has ap- peared to me, that a longer and more ac- tive operation of mercury on the fyftem is' neceffary for the permaneut cure of con- ftitutional fymptoms in true fyphilis, than for that of the primary chancre.

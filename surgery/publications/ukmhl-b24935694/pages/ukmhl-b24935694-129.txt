RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. I 23 tions of fulphate of zinc, and nitrate of filver, calomel, and muriate of mercury in lime i water. In lefs than a month the fore was nearly healed, except in that part which co- vered the urethra about half-way below the penis; and here the ulceration feemed kept up by the efcape of fome urine from the canal, and he had at this time a frequent propen- fity to void his urine. It appeared probable, that the urethra had not been in a found ftate prior to his contradling this complaint, and that it had derived additional irritation from the proximity of the fore to the mouth of the canal, as well as from that part where its ulceration had occalioned an opening. At this time an indolent enlargement of the right teftis took place, and fo large a hydro- cele was formed, that I was much inclined to pundture it, to relieve him from the in- convenience occafioned by its weight. The patient, however, was anxious to return into the country, where he was directed to con- tinue the fame mild mercurial courfe. In Â»>A January, 1807, he returned to town, and dur- ing the interval, the hydrocele difappeared, though fome enlargement of the teftis ftill continued.

OF THE URETHRA, &C. 195 flamed and irritable, it is probable that the diforder will extend into the urethra for fome fmall diftance. In the fourth cafe, I believe that the difeafe in queftion was com- plicated with an irritable Hate of the bladder; but whether it was to be conlidered as an adjunct circumftance, or in the relation of caufe or effedt, cannot be determined. The irritability of the bladder was diminifhed, but not cured, by the treatment which leflened this difeafe. In one gentleman, who appa- rently died of an irritable bladder, and who complained of the fenfations, which I have defcribed, in an acute degree, on the bougie palling through the proftate, the difeafed parts were examined, but very trivial morbid appearances were-difcovered. The lining of the bladder was not perfedfly natural, and was inflamed; yet the difeafed appearances were not ftriking; and in the urethra the deviation from the healthy ftrudture was Hill lefs obfervable. It is not improbable, however, that fuch morbid fenfibility of the proftatic urethra ftay arife from an irritable bladder. Perhaps, o 2 alio.

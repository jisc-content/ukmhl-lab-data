RESEMBLING SYPHILIS. 171 how liable an individual is to err, in form- ing general conclulions from his own limited experience, and confcious that the opinions which I entertained refpedting thefe difeafes werp different from thofe of a great number of eminent furgeons, I at firft publifhed my obfervations on the fubjedt in portions ; and the fame apprehenfion as to the pof- fibility of error has now induced me to re- publifh them in a lefs methodical manner than I could have wifhed. I thought this mode would fhew better the rife and progrefs of thofe opinions which I cannot but enter- tain j inafmuch, as they appear legitimately to be deduced from facts. Had I publifhed all I knew and thought relative to thefe fubjedts under another title, had I called the book additional obfervations on venereal difeafes, or on progreffive and remittent fyphilis, it might have been better received, becaufe it might have been more accordant to the notions of others. Yet in whatever way I might have reprefented the fubjedf, the difference would only have been in the manner of difplaying it; there would have been none in the matter to which it related, as that confifts of adtual occurrences in pradfice.

ON DISEASES 114 x CASE XVI. A gentleman between twenty and thirty years of age, refiding in the country, had an ulcer in the prepuce, which, to ufe the words of his furgeon, had more the appear- ance of excoriation than chancre ; it was fuc- ceeded by a bubo and ulcerated throat. For each of thefe difeafes he ufed mercury fo freely as to convince fome of his medical at- tendants that the difeafe could not be fy- philitic ; his furgeon faid enough to cure twenty fyphilitic patients. The ulcers in his whilfl it fpread on the other. The conftitutional fymp- toms were fpeedily cured by a flight mercurial affe&ion, but they broke out again under a fevere courfe of mer- cury. Many conftitutional fymptoms got well without the ufe of mercury, and when at laft it was employed again on account of the ftubborn nature of the nodes, thefe difeafes yielded to a flight, and were aggravated by a fevere courfe of mercury. The difeafe laflly yielded to an alterative courfe of mercury, fo flight as not mani- feftly to affedt the conflitution, and during which, the t patient got mufcular, fat, and healthy. The fubjedt of this cafe was a remarkably healthy man, and had before contradded fyphilitic difeafes, which were regular in their progrefs and cure. Mercury alfo affcdted hi3 conflitution in the mode which is confidered moll de- < Arable for the cure of fyphilis. throat

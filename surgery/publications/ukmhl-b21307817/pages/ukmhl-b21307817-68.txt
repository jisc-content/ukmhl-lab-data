04 both in the estimation of the Profession, and so far as it can undei stand the question, in the eyes of the whole community. In the third paragraph, the Petition assumes, in the most unqualified manner, that the Society of Apothecaries is willing to relinquish its position as an examining body; whereas, it is notorious in the Profession, that the Society has never given its unqualified assent to relinquish its powers ; the Society has, on the contrary, upon all occasions, explicitly stated, that it must previously be satisfied that the General Practitioners are to be placed in an improved position, and possessed of an efficient control over the education and qualification of their own class. This conditional surrender of the Society’s present powers may be adduced as a further guarantee that the proposed College of General Practitioners, will not, if established, be of an in- ferior character. The fourth and fifth paragraphs express the sentiments and wishes of the Petitioners, upon—as-appears on the face of the Petition—the most erroneous assumptions and misapprehensions. The sixth and last paragraph prays that the College of Sur- geons may have a power given to it, which will enable it to remedy the injustice which has been perpetrated upon its Members. This is to seek for the accomplishment of an impos- sibility. In the first place, the College could not now exercise such a power without committing a new and equal injustice to another portion of its Members,—those who have obtained the Fellowship by Examination and the payment of Fees. Time and the course of events, have rendered it totally impossible for the College to repair the injustice complained of, and the Council of the Institute cannot but feel, that a pertinacious reiteration to the Profession of the practicability of this repara- tion, which can never be effected by any change in the College itself, can only tend to prevent any settlement of the Medical question, and to protract Professional anarchy.

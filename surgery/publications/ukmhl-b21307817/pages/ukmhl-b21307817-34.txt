It will be seen that it embraces in all essential particulars the “ Sugges- tions for Principal Heads of a Charter,” framed by the Com- mittee of the National Association, and ratified at a General Meeting of the Association, held at the Hanover Square Rooms, on the 14th day of March, 1845 ; at which meeting it is reported that about one thousand gentlemen had assembled.

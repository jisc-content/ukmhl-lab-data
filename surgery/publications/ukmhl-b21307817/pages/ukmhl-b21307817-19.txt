15 [Copy.] THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE, SURGERY, ami MIDWIFERY. —The attention of the profession is hereby called to the following particulars relating to the MEDICAL REGISTRATION BILL, now before the House of Commons:— First—By Clause 4 any person who, subsequently to the passing of the bill, shall obtain a diploma, certificate, or licence, granted by any English, Irish, or Scotch university, college or society, or any corporation legally entitled to grant the same, will be entitled to register.

The sole, avowed, universally acknowledged, and approved object of this has been to secure the public interests by obtaining for the general practitioners in future a complete medical and surgical education, and by preventing any individual practising the profession after the passing of a measure of

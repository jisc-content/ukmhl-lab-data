13 REPORT. It ■will be in the recollection of the Members of the Institute, that the Three Reports of the Joint Deputation, “appointed with full authority, on behalf of the National Association of General Practitioners, to accept such a Charter of Incorporation for the General Practitioners as the Crown might be advised to grant, and on behalf of the Society of Apothecaries to relinquish their present privileges, as soon as the terms of the proposed Charter should be adjusted, under the sanction of Her Majesty’s Advisers, to the satisfaction of the Deputation; ” bearing date respectively, May 12th, 1845, August 5th, 1845, and February 25th, 1846, and published together on the 18th March, 1846; detailing the particulars of the negociations between the Depu- tation and the Government; conveyed to the Profession the discouraging intelligence that the Right Honorable Sir James Graham, the then Secretary of State for the Home Department, deemed it inexpedient that a Measure of such importance as a Bill for Medical Reform should again be introduced into Parliament, unless with a reasonable probability of its meeting with the concurrence of the Medical Corporations, and of its giving satisfaction to the Profession generally; and declined in- troducing a Bill such as he laid upon the Table of the House of Commons in the preceding Session, “ the communications which he had received during the recess not justifying him in enter- taining any expectation of such general satisfaction.”

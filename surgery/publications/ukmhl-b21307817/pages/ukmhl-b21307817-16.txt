12 The Report consists, mainly, of a consideration of the circum- stances which relate especially to the General Practitioners; doubtless, the profession will receive, from other parties, an exposition of the views of the different corporations. The Council of the Institute will, in this place, refer only to one other point. In a series of resolutions by some gentlemen in Gloucestershire, a copy of which is given in the Report, the poweis of the Council to represent the General Practitioners are called in question. The Council consists of Forty-eight General Practitioners, Metropolitan and Provincial, intrusted with the interests of the largest Voluntary Association of Medical Practitioners ever known in this countryâ€”The National Asso- ciation consisting of upwards of four thousand of their brethren of the same class in the Profession. This trust was reposed in them, formally and constitutionally, by the Association. The Committee of the Association comprising upwards of one hundred Members (for the most part Presidents, Vice-Presidents, or other office bearers of the different Local Associations of General Practitioners) have from time to time expressed their cordial approval of the proceedings of the Council. The Government satisfied itself that the Council of the Institute fully and fairly represents this great interest. Under these circumstances, however, from personal considerations, they might be inclined, the members of the Council could not shrink from the responsi- bility thus imposed upon them by their Professional brethren, without laying themselves open to the charge of an unjustifiable abandonment of a great public trust.

If, on the other hand, the Profession can take a sober view of its own case, and as a body of practical men, is willing to accept a real practical positive even though partial good, the advantage of which will be immediate, rather than aim at a shadow, and con- tent itself with an utopia which assuredly will never be realised, —then, in the opinion of the Council, it will cordially support the principles which have been assented to—ever remembering that to secure the success of those principles, even under the present favourable circumstances, unanimity is most essential; that some of the more powerful parties to the arrangement may shrink from those active operations which are still necessary to carry it through;—ever remembering—that if, unhappily, the honest convictions of the active promoters of this measure are too lightly prized, and their efforts, founded upon those convictions, neutralized by any vexatious and irrational opposition, upon the heads of the opposing parties will rest the responsibility; and that,whatever evils themselves may have to bear witb, from the indefinite postponement of all reform, or the enactment, amidst the chaos of opinion, of a measure inimical to their own interests or wishes, to none other than themselves can they impute the blame.

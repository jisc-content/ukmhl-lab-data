80 Surgeons. Conference at the College of Physicians, bearing date the 8th February. [Copy.] That those persons shall be entitled to be registered as Surgeons, who shall have been admitted as Fellows or Members by the Royal College of Surgeons. That the Members of the College of Surgeons who dispense medicines, or supply medicines to their patients, shall be required to enrol themselves in the College of General Practitioners, and to be registered as Surgeons and General Practitioners; and after the passing of the Act, Members of the Royal College of Sur- geons shall not be registered as Surgeons unless they be also admitted as Members of the Royal College of General Practitioners, and registered both as Surgeons and General Practitioners. Extract from Mr. Guthrie s Evidence before the Parliamen- tary Committee, 3rd March, 1848. By Mr. Wakley. (248.) You state that there have been Meetings between the existing Corporate Bodies, and persons calling them- selves the National Institute; have you been present at those Meetings? No; the Executive officers manage the business of the College. (253.) I will read you a passage from the Document* I refer to—“ But after the passing of this act, those who shall be admitted as Members shall be also admitted by the Royal College of Surgeons, and registered as General Practitioners.” Do yon consider that it would be fair to deny to those gentlemen the right of being registered as Surgeons, or that it would be satisfactory to the Profession generally ? f Certainly not; I know it would be very unsatisfactory to the great Body of the Profession. * This “ Document” being the Principles, from which the above is a verbatim extract. t The words in italics in these extracts have been rendered so by the Council.

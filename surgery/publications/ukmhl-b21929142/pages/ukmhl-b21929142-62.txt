He will not then be afraid to go forward into the as- semblies of the learned, whatever may be the subject which they are met to discuss, for he is not only learned in Medicine, but he is learned in all things. Instead of being a man who can talk only of blood and wounds, and fevers, and apoplexies, and palsies, and such like subjects, he is a man who can join in conversation upon all subjects—who can talk either upon Medicine, or other things, just as occasion demands.

ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C, 69 Universities and Colleges grant as usual their degrees and diplomas ; but, let the candidates who come before them to pass for surgeons, be able also to pass for physicians. This is what should be done; and, therefore, I have set down in my plan the same course of study for both; and, in speaking to them through these Letters, I wish it to be understood that I speak to them both indiscriminately; be- cause I conceive that they stand in need nearly of the same advice. Without talent what does either a degree or a diploma signify, and, with it, it signifies about as little which the man has. Dr Baillie was a phy- sician, Sir Astley Cooper is only a surgeon; but which of these men have earned the greatest reputation, or which of them will be latest known to posterity, it is not easy to determine. I do not pretend to tell in this book the par- ticular curriculum of education which is de- manded atthe different medical schools of this island. This would be needless; becausealmost every year there are some new arrangements made, and some new law or other promulgated, which renders it necessary for the student to consult, at the commencement of every session at least, the particular statutes of his school.

30 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. But if, on the contrary, it be abstruse, al- though still it may be deserving of all their attention, they give no attention to it; they are wishing him done long before the hour expires ; like the school-boy, they are anxious to get to play again.—Well, the years pass over them—At an early age they finish their education, and are ready to go forth into the world as medical men. But what are their feelings now. They feel that they are but ill qualified to act the part for which they are said to be prepared. They know that in undertaking the treatment of dangerous and difficult disease, they undertake what is in a measure to them darkness and uncer- tainty. They are conscious of the blunders (serious ones too) which they may commit when they begin to exercise their calling, and they are ever in fear of having their ignorance exposed. They keep back from the society of the better-informed, and avoid all trials of skill, being satisfied of their own inferiority. In a word, they feel, that when they were finishing they ought only to have been beginning their education, and they will regret to the end of their professional lives the early age at which they were put to the study of Medicine.

His passions, and pro- pensities, and powers both of body and mind should be examined. And when we have fixed on the occupation which we think will suit him, then the nature of it should be as fully as possible set before him, in order that he may still have it in his power to draw oflP, if he thinks the task will be more than he is able for. He should have the hardships which he will have to encounter stated to him ; the sacrifices, as well as the gainsâ€”the disagreeable parts, as well as the agreeable ones, should be brought fully forward ; and now when he is told of all these, if he chooses to go on with it, let him go; he knows what the labour is, and as he has accepted it wil- lingly, we, of course, expect that he will perform it to the utmost of his ability. But never should the parent make his will the guide, or use undue persuasion in the matter. A dutiful child will, no doubt, obey the wishes of his parent, even to the sacrifice of his feelings; but the chance is, that both parent and son will discover, when too late.

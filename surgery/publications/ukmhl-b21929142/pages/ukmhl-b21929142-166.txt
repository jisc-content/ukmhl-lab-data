148 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. has been given ; and we generally find that those people, with all their cleverness, are every now and then falling into mistakes. Some diseases, indeed, are so evident that but little examination is required, and the means of cure are also so plain, that there can be as little hesitation regarding them. But many—a great many—are obscure, and require particular inquiry, and if this inquiry be not given, the patient has not fair play;— either his disease is allowed to go on and prove fatal to him, or at least he is allowed to labour under it for a much longer period than is necessary. And the great loss is, that when a surgeon gets into this system of hurrying, he cannot check it; he does it at all times—in all cases, whether clear or ob- scure ; and the consequence is, that at some time or other a more careful surgeon falls in with some one of his patients, and detects at once what he did not detect in all his exami- nations, and thus the skill of the one is ex- alted, while the other gets considerably into the shade. This is what has raised many, even of moderate talent, to a great height in their profession—namely, a strict attention to examination. Neither patients nor friends like to see a surgeon with a hurried manner.

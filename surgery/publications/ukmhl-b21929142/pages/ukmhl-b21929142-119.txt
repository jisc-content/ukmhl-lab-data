ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. 101 then there must be no risk run—we must not put Hfe at hazard for his sake. He may practise, if he only practises under the eye of another; he may be allowed to take the management of sick under all diseases, if he will consent to have a looker-on—one who can put him right if he should get into mis- take. But farther than this it is impossible to go; and I am certain that what I have here said must be the feeling of every right thinking person. Great evil, I know, has ac- crued to society, from thus letting the unri- pened and uninformed take upon themselves the parts of finished men, and the evil, of course, can only be prevented when medical practitioners, and the public in general, shall have combined to let such things be no more. If a practitioner will give a pupil a part of his patients in charge, let him pick out the best, ' his ablest, his most experienced pupil; one upon whose knowledge he has great reliance; one that he would not hesitate to put himself under, if he were ill. But even this, I do not quite go in with. The law supposes no man to practise till he has been examined and found qualified, and I say, that the more the law is observed the better will it be for every body.

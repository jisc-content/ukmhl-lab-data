ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. taste of the sweets of life like other men.— Neither body nor mind can be kept at labour incessantly. We must interpose occasional relaxation, if we would keep the human ma- chine in healthy action—and, therefore it is absolutely necessary that the medical man, who has such severe and engrossing duties to perform, should now and then have a cessation from toil. And not only should he cease the labour of the body, but he ought to invigorate and recreate the mind, by taking part with the rest of society in the innocent amusements which may be around him, for thus he prepares himself better for labours which may be to come. Of course, we are supposing him to have the same fondness for society, and the same inclination for enjoy- ment, that are found in the generality of men. There are some beings for whom society has no charms—whose whole enjoyment is in seclusion—^^and such people will not seek or require the recreation I am now alluding to. But wherever the heart is buoyant—^^yherever the spirit is such that it longs for the society of kindred spirits—it may safely enough be given up to moderate joy. Even the medi- cal man, as I have already said, during the time he has to spare, may be like his fellows.

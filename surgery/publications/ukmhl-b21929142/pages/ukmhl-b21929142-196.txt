ON MKDICAL EDUCATION, &C. 178 seem to be well aware of. I like to see man cultivating his mind, and gathering know- ledge from every quarter. I like to see even the poorest and most menial in life increasing in wisdom. But when we see knowledge tending to evil, in whatever way, we are jus- tified in sounding the alarm. He is culpable who does not speak out when there is cause for speaking. And I have no hesitation in saying, that those popular books on Medicine, and those institutions at which medical science is taught to all, are curses instead of blessings to mankind, when the pupils set themselves up as perfect scholars, and sup- pose themselves capable of undertaking the management of disease. Before concluding, I have again to allude shortly to quackery. I am far>^from deny- ing that some of our quack medicines are possessed of considerable efficacy. I have seen some of them of use; I have prescribed them ; and I know that they are occasionally prescribed by men who know well about disease. But I object to them on two grounds—^first, because they would pass them upon us as certain remedies—and, secondly, as remedies suited for all stages of a disease. Now, we all know that no remedy is certain.

REPORT ON MIDWIFERY, ETC. meters measure 9 centimetres — 3^ inches. tebra. Therefore, if we add up the thickness of the symphysis, the thickness of the vertebral column, and of the true conjugate, we almost always obtain a greater measurement than Baudelocque's. (2) The diagonal conjugate is of great importance for the recognition of the degree of pelvic contraction. If we cannot reach the promon- tory with two fingers, the true conjugate is not much contracted. If we can measure the diagonal conjugate, then we obtain, in a generally contracted pelvis, by the deduction of 7"'; in the flat pelvis, by the deduction of 8J-'"; and in the rachitic pelvis, of nearly 9"'—a near approach to the true conjugate. (3) If we wish to correct the figures so obtained (which it is espe- cially necessary to do in rachitic pelves), and to get the true conjugate as accurately as possible, then we must resort to Van Huevel's pelvi- meter. Hitherto this is unsurpassed for accuracy (' Mon. f. Geb.,' 1867). On the relations between the external and the true conjugate diameters of the pelvis. By Prof. Dohrn.—The results confirm the conclusions of Michaelis, Crede, and Schroder. In the flattened pelvis the sub- traction to be made from the external conjugate to arrive at the true conjugate is liable to the greatest variations. The measurement of the external conjugate in the living subject cannot be depended upon as a means of estimating the true conjugate (' Mon. f. Geburtsk.,' April, 1867). Dr. Carl Martin contributes an elaborate memoir on obstetric and gynaecological weights and measurements. In 1700 measurements he found the distances between the anterior superior spinous processes of the ilia to give a minimum of 189 centimetres, a maximum of 31*5, and a mean of 25 "4 Out of 1500 measurements this diameter in 451 cases was above 24 and below 2 5; in 757 it was over 25. He concludes that the proper diameter is 25 centimetres = 9^ inches. The distance between the crests of the ilia gave a minimum of 24, a maximum of 33 8, and a mean 28'5. The standard distance he con- cludes to be 28 centimetres =10^ inches. The distance between the trochanters justified a standard of 31 centi- metres, or u£ inches, closely agreeing with the measurements of Michaelis and H. F. Naegele. The external conjugate showed in 1700 measurements a minimum of i6-4, a maximum of 25, a mean of 20 centimetres = 7" 5"'. This he takes as the standard. The right external oblique diameter gave in 1.500 cases a minimum of 19, a maximum of 27, a mean of 22"6. The left external oblique diameter gave somewhat smaller measurements; the maximum was only 26-5, the mean only 22"5. The mean of the two oblique diameters must be taken at 22^5 centimetres. The conjugata vera he has determined on 16 dead subjects. He takes 4 inches as the standard. The transverse diameter of the brim he found in 25 dissections of narrow pelves to be 13'2 ; in 34 middling and large pelves to be 13-8; in the whole 59 to be 13*58. He adopts 13-5 centimetres = 5 inches, as the standard. The oblique diameter he obtains is 12-5 centimetres = 43- inches. The sacro-cotyloid dia-

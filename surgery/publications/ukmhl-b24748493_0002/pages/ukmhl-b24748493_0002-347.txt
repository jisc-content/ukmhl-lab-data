PARALYSIS WITH MUSCULAR ATROPHY. 337 mined the body of a child which died of this disease at the age of thirteen. They found the electro-muscular contractility everywhere intact. Nothing abnormal was discovered in the nervous and vascular sj stems. To the touch, the muscles of the lower limbs gave the sensa- tion of a doughy and inelastic mass. They were marked with stripes or stria? of a yellow or yellowish-white appearance. On section, they shone with a kind of greasy light. At certain points they could not be distinguished by the naked eye from the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The muscles of the upper extremities presented a similar kind of structure; but they were much atrophied, as were also those of the trunk. Under the microscope, those especially of the lower extremities seemed to be filled with adipose tissue; but the muscular tissue itself was not altered. Griesinger and Billroth had already observed a simi- lar state in the living subject. It is rare, however, to find any oily particles in them ('Verhandl. d. Berliner Med. G-es.,' i, iqi—205). Heller, who examined two brothers that died of this disease, seems to consider it as a kind of fatty degeneration, for he calls it lipomatous ('Deutsche Archiv Klin. Med.,' 1,616—627). Seidel also records three cases belonging to the same family, under the term of "lipomatous atrophy of the muscles, or muscular atrophy." 2:1

INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 167 show that the colon was affected low down; but other cases contradict the validity of the sign. Dr. Fagge is inclined to believe that the seat is not so much the key to the symptoms as is the nature of the obstruction, i. e. of the patho- logic lesion causing it, being of one kind in a case of stricture, whether ft 1*1* of ileum or rectum, and of another kind in a case of strangulation ot the bowel, whether of the small intestine and its mesentery by a band or of the sigmoid flexure by a twist of that bowel on its own axis. But strictures of the large intestine are common, those of the small intes- tine rare ; whilst, conversely, it is the ileum, and not the colon, which is most apt to become strangulated. So that thus the distinctions which depend on the nature of the lesion have been associated rather with its seat. Dr. Fagge then proceeds to inquire into the value of the symptom scanty urine as indicating obstruction of the small intestine. Dr. Barlow was the first to point out the importance of this indication; he attributed it to the seat of the disease; some later writers rather to the quantity of fluid vomited in obstruction of the upper portion of the small intestine. Dr. Fagge inclines to the view of Mr. Sedgwick, that the site causes the suppression, but not on account of its interfering with the absorption of fluid so much as with the innervation of the parts concerned. Dr. Fagge next proceeds to give, in their respective order, all the different causes of obstruction he has above described, with the cases illustrative of each. He is in favour of exploratory operations in carefully selected cases of internal strangulation; of in- flation for intussusception. With regard to volvulus, he gives no decided opinion.

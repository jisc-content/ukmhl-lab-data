Valvular Diseases. M. Durosiez maintains that stenosis of the tricuspid valve is a more common disease than it is generally thought to be. He has himself observed 10 cases during life, and verified the diagnosis in all by post- mortem examination. Of these patients, 9 were between the ages of 22 and fl, the other was aged 60; the latter case was somewhat special, as there was no disease of any other valve but the tricuspid. There

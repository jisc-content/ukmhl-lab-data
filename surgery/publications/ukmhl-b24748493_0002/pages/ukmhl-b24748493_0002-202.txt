192 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. Dr. Hilton Faggc (' Guy's Hospital Eeporta,' 1867) contributes some remarks on keloid scleriasis and niorphosis. He first of all distinguishes between the keloid of Alibcrt and the keloid of Addison, and enters into a discussion of that vexed topic, the origin of the term. He considers this disease as identical with that described by foreign writers as scleriasis. He shows that the raised and ivory-like portions of the skin may recover their elasticity and their normal texture, if not their colour, in certain instances.

[Tho Editor regrets that a mass of material prepared for the report on skin diseases has unavoidably been omitted, owing to want of space. It should, perhaps, be said that, in selecting the matter contained in the preceding report, the Editor has with rare exceptions drawn it from the evanescent sources of journalism, rather than from the more permanent and, therefore, more readily attainable records preserved in volumes of reports, lectures, &c.â€”En.]

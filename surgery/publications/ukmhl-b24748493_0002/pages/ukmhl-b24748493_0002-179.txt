109 KIDN'EY DISEASES. Dr. Bateinan, of Norwich, gives an account (ibid., Feb. 9, 1867) of the case of a dyspeptic, who, whenever he indulged in anything inducing an attack of his malady, showed sarcina) in his urine. Dr. Charles Berrell gives (' Med. Times and Gaz.,' March 14, 1868) a note of the composition of the urine in a case of leucocythemia, under the care of Dr. Beale, in King's College Hospital. The total quantity of urine passed a few days before death was 26*5 fl, oz. in twenty-four hours. Its specific gravity was 1033-8. It contained— Normal urine at same period of life (Parkes). Urea . . 504-60 grs 361*5 grs. Uric acid. . 1828 „ .... 6-o ,, Chlorine . . 9*26 „ .... 76-0 „ Phosphoric acid 41*05 „ .... 34-5 ,, Sulphuric acid . 41-80 „ .... 22'o ,, All the elements are increased; but the most notable exception to the normal condition is the uric acid, which is in the proportion of 1 to 28 of urea, the ordinary ratio being 1 to 60. In another case spoken of by Parkes the ratio was as high as 1 to 13. Togel and Schmidt (c Cent. Blatt. f. Med. Wiss.,' May 30, 1868) give a plan for estimating volumetrically the uric acid contained in urine. A solution of iodine in iodide of potassium, at an ordinary summer tem- perature (150—200 C), is to be allowed to act on a dilute solution of uric acid, produced by concentrating the urine ; it will thereby become decolorized, 1 atom of uric acid =168 being equivalent to or exhaust- ing 2 of iodine = 254. The action begins immediately, and is ended in twenty-four hours. One atom of uric acid = C5H,N403 = 1*48 grms., dissolved in 2 of caustic soda = 2( jj [ 0 1 = o*8 grms., gives, when diluted to 2 litres a neutral salt of soda in solution, corresponding with the average con- centration of human urine. Ten c.c. of this solution, containing 6-0084 grms. of uric acid, on neutralization of the soda contained therein by 10 c.c. 1-100 normal hydrochloric acid, = '00365 C1H, and this acid, treated with excess of the iodine solution, decolorises, in 24 hours, -0127 grm. of iodine = 10 c.c. 1-100 normal solution of iodine. By treating with hyposulphite of soda when the action has ceased, the quantity of free iodine left behind may be easily and exactly esti- mated. In the first half hour about the half, and in the next two hours th ree fourths, of the quantity of iodine indicated is used up; in 12 hours the reaction is nearly ended, and after 24 hours, in ordinary summer temperature, no further effect is produced. The authors maintain that this process is not much liable to error, either by acids in the urine, by urea, hippuric acid, kreatin, sugar, or albumen, or even by the urinary pigments. One grm. of uric acid accordingly consumes 1*512 grm. of iodine. One grm. iodine consumed implies -6614 grm. of uric acid. Since urine seldom contains more than 1 per 1000 of uric acid,

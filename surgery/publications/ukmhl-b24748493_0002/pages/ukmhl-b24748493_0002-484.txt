Very few new remedies have been introduced into medical practice Bince the publication of the last volume of the ' Retrospect.' The fol- lowing may, however, be mentioned : Eucalyptus globulus.—Dr. Ullersperger* recommends this plant as a valuable febrifuge and intermittent. It has been found useful in ague when quinine has failed. Kinovic acid.—Dr. Kernerf states that this acid is the chief cause of the tonic properties of cinchona bark, and recommends its employment as a therapeutic agent. He employs kinovate of lime as the best form for the administration of the acid; to be given in the form of powder. "When given even in large doses it produces no cerebral congestion, as the nitrogenous constituents of bark do, and adults experience not the slightest ill effects after taking daily half or three quarters of an ounce of the salt. It acts as a bitter and tonic, and is superior to most other bitters. Its most striking effect is upon the peristaltic movement of the intestines, which is at once abated ; hence the remedy is a valuable one in severe dysentery and in nervous diarrhoea. Forty grains of the kinovate of lime in powder, or the same quautity in water, to which sufficient phosphoric acid is to be added to precipitate the kinovic acid, is an average dose. Anceslhetics.—Since the issue of the last ' Ketrospect' the English medical journals have been full of discussions upon anaesthetics. First, Dr. Protberoe Smith reintroduced the tetrachloride of carbon; then Dr. B. W. liichardson discovered a new anaesthetic agent, the so-called bichloride of methylene; and, lastly, the American plan of producing anaesthesia by protoxide of nitrogen (laughing gas) has been introduced into this country, and extensively employed. The first of these agents is now seldom heard of; the second docs not appear to have sustained

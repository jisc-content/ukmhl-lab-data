MUSCLE. 23 nity occurred to him of observing well-marked ciliary movements in. the cells of the larvae of certain gasteropodous animals belonging to the genus Eolis, in which the cells were large, cylindrical, or somewhat Battened, with indications of transverse striation, and contained one, two, or more strongly retractile bodies. The number of cilia on these cells varied from six to eight, and their length was 0 014 mm. Besides the transverse striation the protoplasmic material contained within the cells presented, witli careful adaptation of the light, longitudinal striae or a columnar arrangement, each cell possessing from forty to sixty columns. That these elements are of a muscular nature M. Stuart considers ia rendered evident by observing the movements of the nucleus, which may be seen to be drawn hither and thither, according to the action of the different strands, to the extent of one fourth of the whole length of the cell, ceasing when the cilia themselves cease to move, and re- commencing with their recurrence. The stria?, like muscular tissue in general, became much more distinctly defined on immersion in a solu- tiou of 1 per cent, of chromic acid. M. Stuart agrees with Dr. Elistiakowsky, that both constant and interrupted electrical currents act as irritants to ciliary movement, and attributes the opposite results obtained by earlier experimenters to the employment of impro- perly constructed apparatus, occasioning the destruction of the cells. It is probable that in chemical composition the contents of the cells essentially consist of an albuminate of soda, since the movements are stopped in two or three minutes by weak acids, and if the action be not too long continued can be restored by alkalies, which powerfully stimulate ciliary action. Engelmann* estimates the number of vibrations of the cilia of ciliated epithelium at as many as 700 per minute during life. Kiibnef observes that the presence of free oxygen is requisite for the persist- ence of ciliary movement, but it will continue in a solution of oxidized haemoglobin till all the haemoglobin is reduced. Addition of acids, and even of C02, stops it, but it recurs on neutralization. Stuart states that the movement is stopped by sugar as soon as this has endosmosed into the interior of the cell. Eouget.J from observations on the muscular spiral band in the stalk of the Vorticella, concludes that in the natural condition muscle is contracted, and that its elongation is a vital condition. He describes it as consisting of spiral fibres,ยง and as having, like a spiral spring, a constant tendency to contract, into which condition it passes when all exciting and trophic agencies have ceased. He denies that in tetanus there is an oscillatory movement of the muscular ele- ments. A remarkable form of muscular fibre existing in the crocodile has been described by Dr. Hair. j| In this case the fibres consist of a * ' Centralblatt,' 1867, No. 42. f ' Schultze's Archiv,' 1867, ii, p. 372. % ' Coiuptes Rent)./ Ixiv, p. 1128, p. 1232, p. 1276. ยง A full acount of the es>ay of M.Rouget, contained in Brown-Sequard's ' Journal de i'Anatomie,' which khould have been noticed in the last report, will be found in the โข Brit, and For.

SKIN DISEASES. Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, in a valuable paper contained in the ' London Hospital Eeports' for 1867, and -which we are sorry want of space forbids us to quote at greater length, gives the following valuable synopsis of doctrine. In order to succeed in the cure of skin diseases, we must be prepared to act promptly and energetically in the following articles of creed: (1) That the itch insect is the real cause of scabies. (2) That a vegetable parasite is the real cause of favus, ringworm, and tinea versicolor. (3) That most inflammatory products are contagious, and can induce, if applied whilst living to healthy tissues of the same kind as those which furnishes them, a similar form of inflammatory action. (4) That the contagion of recent and living pus formed by the skin is a very common cause of skin-inflammations, and may induce them as well in the same patient as in others. (5) That inflammations of the skin spread in extent by the contagion of continuity, i. e. by cells produced by inflammation coming in contact with those as yet healthy. (6) That to prevent or put an end to the contagion of inflammatory products, all that is necessary is to destroy their vitality.

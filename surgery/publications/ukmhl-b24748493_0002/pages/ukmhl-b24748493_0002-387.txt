Seeees relates ('Gaz. des Hop.,' 1867) a casein which, after recovery from ovariotomy, a small fistula remaining from a suture yielded blood at every period. T. Bryant relates a case in which blood issued from the stump of an ovarian pedicle a month after operation. Louis Mayer, of Berlin, has studied the question of the first appear- ance of menstruation in different races. The subject was illustrated by many contributions to the International Medical Congress held in Paris in 1867 ('Gaz. des Hopitaux'). Lagneau collected 15,948 ob- servations from different physicians, showing that menstruation appears between 15 and 16 years in Labrador, North Germany, Warsaw, Stra-burg, Lyons, Madeira, and Jamaica; between 16 and 17 in Norway, Copenhagen, Poland ; and between 14 and 15 in Manchester, London, Paris, Marseilles, Toulon, Corfu; and before the 13th year in British India. Joulin collected 16,517 cases; 10,080 of these belong to the zone between 330 and 540 north latitude. Menstruation set in at 15 in 1824 cases, at 16 in 15,162, and at 14 in 1114. In the hot zone, between 330 north and the equator, 1724 cases are collected, in 407 menstruation appeared at 12 ; in 381 at 13. Out of 4713 cases in the frigid zone it appeared at 15 in 872, at 16 in 874. H.Vogt ('Norsk Magaz. of Obstetrics,' 1867) di scusses the occur- rence of menstruation in Norway. Out of 1821 girls, the average first appearance was i6'i2 years; Laplanders, 167. In 1448 persons the average duration waa 37 days; for Laplanders, 3-4 days. One Laplander menstruated only once a year. In 391 women 49 was the average age of cessation. 25

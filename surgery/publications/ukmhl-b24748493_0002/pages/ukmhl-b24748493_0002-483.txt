473 INSANITY. Dr. J. Bay discusses delusion considered as a test of insanity.* Delusion has been defined to be " the belief of facts which no sane man would believe," and as "a belief in sometbing extravagant, having no existence whatever, and out of which the person cannot be reasoned by any conceivable degree of evidence;" and again, " delusion is a belief of facts which no rational reason would have believed." In these definitions the very point to be proved is assumed. Dr. Ray would define a delusion to be a belief in something impossible; the impossibility being not in the nature of tilings, but in the circumstances of the case. In order to determine whether a certain belief is a veritable delusion, or only the mistake of a sane mind, it may be necessary to scrutinise the psychological character and experience of the individual who entertains it. Thus, Luther's firm belief of the personal appearance of the devil to him was, at the worst, an hallucination, and not an insane delusion. These differ from each other in this respect, that the false behef implied in the former is connected with impressions made on one or more of the senses, and does not necessarily prove, as the latter does, any derangement of the understanding. The two elements of Luther's belief are easily accounted for without resorting to the theory of insanity. The apparition itself was the result of certain cerebral conditions of a casual transient nature ; and, secondly, the persistent conviction of its reality was consistent with the common belief. Many false beliefs springing from a coarse superstition can be distinguished from genuine delusions only by a careful investigation of the indi- vidual's mental habits and associations. * ' American Joura. of Med, Sc.,' lvi, p. 73. 31

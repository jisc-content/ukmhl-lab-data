REPORT ON MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. BY THOMAS STEVENSON, M.D., M.R.C.P., LECTUKER OX EXPEBIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY AND DEMONSTBATOE OP PEACTICAL CHEMISTEY TO GUY'S HOSPITAL; EXAMINEE IN FOEENSIC MEDICINE IN THE TJNIYEESITY OP LONDON; MEDICAL OFFICES OF HEALTH TO THE FAEISH OF ST. PANGEAS. Poisoning. Des. Ciiuii Beowk and Eraser* have published an elaborate paper t: On the Connection between Chemical Constitution and Physiological Action; with special reference to the Physiological Action of the Salts of the Ammonium Bases derived from Strychnia, Brucia, Thebaia, Codeia, Morphia, and Nicotia." This paper we shall endeavour to epitomise. Although it is obvious that there must exist a relation between the chemical constitution and the physiological action of a substance, as yet scarcely any attempts have been made to discover what this relation is. All that is- known is that, as a rule, the compounds of certain elements and of certain radicles possess, when soluble, a physiological action which appears to be of the same kind for the whole series of compounds of each element or radicle. Since the modus operandi of poisons is almost unknown, and the chemical constitution of those poisons whose physiological action has been most carefully investi- gated is also but little known, small hope was held out of arriving at any law from such data. It appeared to these observers that there was more hope of arriving at some definite conclusion by studying the changes produced in the action of physiologically active substances by performing upon them certain well-defined chemical operations which introduce known changes into the constitution of these substances, but do not break up the molecule. Operations of this kind are (i) replace- ments, and (2) additions. Eor example, the operation indicated by these symbols, CuS04 + Zn = Zn S04 + Cu, is a case of replacement, whilst the following is one of addition: NH;< + HC1 = HN4C1. Replacement does not appear, as a rule, to produce any marked * 'Trans. Roy. Soc. Eriinb.,' xxv, p. 151 ; abstract in ' Journ.of Anat. and Phys.,' ii, p. 224. 29

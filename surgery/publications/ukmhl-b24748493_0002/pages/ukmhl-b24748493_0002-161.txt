APPLICATION OF THE GRAPHIC PROCESS. 151 The carotid pulse-curve is normally of great height; it has large secondary waves, and a marked tricrotism or even tetracrotism, in conse- quence of its greater nearness to the heart; it is much more affected by respiratory changes than the pulse-curves of other arteries. The alterations of the pulse-curves in tabes do not, as in many other diseases, depend on circulatory abnormalities originating from the heart, but on mere local changes in the vaso-motor nervous system; In cases which, as to symptoms, are classified under the so-called "tabes basalis " there was also a tendency to dicrotism. In cerebral paralysis, on the contrary, the curves show the same characters as those of the radial, both on the paralysed and on the sound side. The same conditions are also fre- quently found in old persons suffering from marasmus without brain disease, when the radial curve, nevertheless, presents no distinctly anaerotous character (i. e. the first secondary elevation as high or higher than the primary apex). This abnormality probably depends on the pathological changes in the walls of the arteries which are so common in such subjects ('Berlin. Klin. "Wochensch.,' 28, 29, 1868).

MYOPIA, ETC. 369 Hence, among children at school, there are three times as many with disorders of refraction as with other affections of the eye. Among the 1334 ametropes there were— 1004 myopes. 10 myopes whose parents also were myopic. 5S myopes whose myopia appeared subsequently to other diseases of the eyes. Si hypermetropes. 156 hypermetropes with convergent strabismus. 23 astigmatics. Hence myopia is twelve times as frequent as simple hypermetropia, and six or seven times as frequent as hypermetropia with convergent strabismus. The third chapter, which occupies about two thirds of the book, is devoted to myopia. We have seen that the author found 1004 myopes, in which number are not included cases of hereditary or consecutive myopia, nor cases in which the myopia was less than M. Cohn states the following propositions : (1) There is no school without myopes. (2) Their number differs greatly in the several categories of schools. (3) They are relatively very few (1*4 per cent.) in village schools. (4) They are eight times as frequent (11'4 per cent.) in town schools. (5) In the primary schools of towns they are four or five times as numerous (67 per cent.) as in the rural schools. (6) The upper girls' schools present more cases (77 per cent.) than the primary schools. ( 7) In town schools the proportion of myopes increases with the grade of the school (primary, 67 ; middle, 10*3 ; normal, 197; and gymnasia, 26-2 per cent.). (8) In village schools, as in those of towns, the proportion of myopes increases with the grade of school, but less rapidly, and not more than 2-4 per cent.; the lowest proportion being o-8, and the highest 3 2 per cent. (9) For a certain number of middle schools, normal schools, and gymnasia, the proportion of myopes differs very little between one school and another. (10) The difference is, however, more considerable in girls' schools, and still more in primary schools, where the proportion of myopic pupils varied from r8 to per cent. The author then states the proportions obtained from the 166 classes in the 33 schools. There were but 11 classes that contained no myopes, and these were all low in their respective schools. By adding separately the myopes of the third, the second, and the first classes, in rural schools, the pro- portions obtained were—1*4, I'j, and 2 6 per cent. By doing the same for the primary schools of .towns, the series became 3-5, 9-8, and 97 per cent. For the normal schools, 9-6, 167, 19 2, 25-1, 26-4, and 44 per cent. Lastly, for the gymnasia, 12-5, 18*2, 237, 31* per cent. Thus, it appears that, in the gymnasia, more than half the pupils of the upper class are myopic; and that in every school, no matter of what

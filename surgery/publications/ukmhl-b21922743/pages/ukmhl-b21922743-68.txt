52 CLINICAL SURGERY. and diseases to which they are Hable, must be subject to modifications and varieties :â€”for example, the trunk of the bracliial artery sometimes divides lugh up in the arm, so that its radial and ulnar divisions, may be said to arrive at the elbow-joirit ready formed. When such a " lusus naturoi" takes place, the usual relations of the parts become materially altered, and in a practical point of view, this merits your particular attention. The relative position wliich the trunk of the brachial artery holds to the median nerve, you should likewise bear in mind. At the upper- third of its course, the nerve hes at the outer or radial side of the artery; but before the vessel arrives at the usual place' of bifurcation, the nerve crosses over to the inner or ulnar side, where it is situated at the bend of the arm. Having premised these anatomical observations, let us now inquire what are the varieties or modifications of trau- matic aneurism which the surgeon is hable to meet with at the bend of the arm ? In reply to this inquiry, I assert, that tlu:ee distinct forms of aneurism, may be produced in this locahty by wounds of the vessels in the neighboui-hood; namely, a diffused false aneurism, a drcimscrihed false aneurism, and the arterio-venous, or varicose aneurism; tliese are distinct from aneurismal varix, wliich always owes its existence to a similar cause. You may now reasonably ask what is the nature of those varieties, and how are they to be distinguished from each other ? To the solution of this question I will now apply myself, by supposing an inexperienced person undertook to perform the ordinary operation of venajsection, and it so happened that in the case which presented itseK, there was, unfortunately a " high division" of the brachial artery, and that one of the

136 CLINICAL SURGERY. not at all urgent, there is little doubt but tlie patient would have had a better chance of recovery, than he had under the treatment which happened to be adopted. Sometimes fractures of the skull are compUcated by hemorrhage, an important blood-vessel being imphcated in the accident. Tor example, when a fracture happens to cross the course of the middle artery of the dura-mater, or open any of the siuuses, hemorrhage is a natural conse- quence, which adds much to the danger of the case. It is by no means unusual for blood to issue from the nose, ears, or pharynx, when fractures occur in the base of the skull. Wlien the blood comes from the ears, and that you have symptoms indicative of severe cerebral injury, and you hear that the patient had either received a blow from some blunt instrument, or fell from a height on the top of his head, you may infer that a fracture of the base of the skull has taken place, and that either the descending portion of one of the lateral sinuses, or one or more of the petrosal sinuses have been opened. Should the blood issue from the nose, or pharynx, there is reason to suppose that the fracture has traversed the body of the sphenoid bone, and has torn through the walls of the cavernous or cncular sinuses ; however, I have known one instance of a fracture of the frontal bone, near the longitudinal sinus, wliich was attended with profuse hemorrhage from the nose : but the patient having recovered, I had no opportunity of ascertain- ing whether the base of the skull had been fractured or not. It is only by a consideration of the history of the case, and these occasional hemorrhages, we are enabled to form an opinion in bad cases of injury of the head, as to whether a fracture of the base of the skull has taken place or not.

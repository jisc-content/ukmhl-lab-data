264 CLINICAL SURGERY. I fear that the pains I have taken to acquire information relative to these supposed antidotes, is calculated to convey the idea, that I attach some importance to their adminis- tration, and have some faith in their efficacy. Tliis I totally disclaim, and firmly beheve they are perfectly wortliless as prophylactic remedies, and that notliing is cal- culated to prove useful as such, but the local measures I have already mentioned. In those cases where the empiri- cal nostrums were administered after the bites had been inflicted, it is unfair to infer that the non-appearance of the disease at a subsequent period, was attributable to their anti-hydrophobic powers. I have aheady stated, that Dr. John Hunter, was of opinion, that not more than one out of twenty persons bitten, would become afflicted with the disease, even if they were left to chance; and that accord- ing to Dr. Hamilton's computation, not more than one in seventeen. Under these circumstances, and in the absence of any proof to the contrary, it is much more rational to sui^pose that the absence of the disease in such cases, de- pended more on imperfect inoculation, or want of suscepti- bility on the part of the bitten animals, to become affected by the virus, than to imagine that its development was pre- vented by the administration of such inert and absurd nos- trums as I have described. Let us now suppose a case in the human subject, where the hydrophobic symptoms have been unequivocally estab- lished, and inquii-e what ought to be done, with a view to reheve the patient? I regi-et exceedingly, that neither ex- perience of the past, nor our knowledge of the present state of medical science, enable me to give a satisfactory answer to this question. Tlie disease so completdy changes the

Perito- nitis is, in fact, a disease, which when once fully estabhshed, its natural course is, progressively onwards, from bad to worse ; and if not quickly arrested by art, nature must yield to its destructive influence. This being the case, you cannot be too prompt in adopting those measures which ex- perience has proved to be the most efficacious in arresting its progress. Tor this purpose, you should commence the treatment by taking blood from the arm; the quantity to be determined by the constitution of the patient, the stage, and violence of the attack, and the effect of the bleed- ing. You are told, by writers and lecturers, that when about to bleed a person under these cu-cumstances, you should place hun in the erect posture, and that the effect mil be much greater than if the same amount of blood were taken whilst lying down. This though true in theory, is seldom practicable: when the patient is seriously at- tacked, he cannot bear to sit up in the bed; every attempt to move, increases the pain, and tends to aggravate the disease. Under these circumstances, you must use your own discretion in choosing a position for your patient, bemg guided very much by the circumstances of each indindual case.

DELIRIUM TREMENS. 217 enema to a man wliilst in the second stage of delirium tremens, nor do I tliink that fifteen or twenty drops of laudanum, given in that form would be attended with much advantage; the patient being a "mems Jiibernicus." Wlien a considerable quantity of opium has been given in any form without having produced a soporific effect, and symptoms of narcotism are being estabhshed, and the pulse fails, so that the patient hes muttering in bed with subsultus, and laborious breathing, the plan of treatment should be altered at once, and the opium laid aside alto- gether. Stimulants should now be freely given, such as camphor, ammonia, aether, &c.; and sinapisms applied to the soles of the feet, and blisters to the nape of the neck, or between the shoulders. CASE. Becemher %nd.—John Hardy, aged 46, was admitted into the hospital this morning affected with the following symptoms :—Tremours of the hands, suffused eyes, con- tracted pupils, but no intolerance of hght; his manner is hurried, and he looks suspiciously around him; pulse 96 and rather fuU; tongue coated with a yellowish mucus; when protruded it trembles; the skin moist and rather warm. The patients in the ward with him state that he has been very restless ever since his admission into the hos- pital ; and that he imagined he saw insects crawKng about his bed. He admits liimseK that he had been drinking on yesterday, but denies that there is any tiling the matter with him. He is a notorious drunkard, and was in the hospital last August in consequence of a violent attack of delirium tremens, with which he is now obviously affected. L

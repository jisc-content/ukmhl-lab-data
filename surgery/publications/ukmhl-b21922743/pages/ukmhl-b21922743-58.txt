42 CLINICAL SURGKKY. Press for March 1843. In the third case, new symptoms and considerations of intense interest are introduced to our notice. The wound was situated between the os-hyoides and upper mai-gin of the thyroid cartilage; the thyroid hgaments, tlie root of the epiglottis, and the mucous membrane M'ere aU com- pletely divided; tliis being the case a large opening of com- munication was established between the external air, and the cavity of the pharynx. Let us reflect, for a moment, upon the effects which such a wound must have immediately pro- duced in the relations and functions of the parts concerned without reference to the important blood-vessels in the neighbourhood, Mdiich for the present, we will suppose escaped uninjured. The human tongue is not only the organ of speech; but it likewise perfoi-ms a most important part in the first stage of deglutition: such being the fact, then, it becomes obAaous that in the case under consideration, that the patient could neitlier speak nor swaUow perfectly; inasmuch, as it had been severed from its principal frsed attaclnnent, by the division of the sterno-hyoid muscles, the thyro-hyoid liga- ments, the epiglottis, and the mucous membrane of the ]3harynx. The instant that these important parts were divided, the following changes must have taken place. Tlie os-hyoides was no longer a fixed point towards which the muscles of the tongue could act: on the contrary, the genio- hyoid, and the genio-hyoglossi muscles di-ew it, the tongue, and epiglottis upwards and forwards towards the cliin; whilst, at the same time, the sterno-tlnToid muscles were engaged in pidlkig the parts beneath the wound down towards the sternum.

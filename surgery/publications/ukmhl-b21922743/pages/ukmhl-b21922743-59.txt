43 SUICIDAL WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. is usually pale, vacant and statue-Kke; with tlie mouth closed^ wlulst the Hps and alse nasi remain motionless; respiration being can-ied on tln^ough the wound. If Hquid of any kind, suppose water, be pom"ed into the patient^'s mouth, it will mechanically trickle down to the wound, tlirough which, in all probability, a gi-eat portion of it will escape; a part of it may also get into the oesophagus and stomach; wlulst some of it will present itseK for admission into the larynx; but the epiglottis having been removed, tliis may give rise to u-ritation, coughing, symptoms of suffocation, and even death itself! Let us now inquire the various ways in wliich death may be produced by such a wotmd as the one I have just de- scribed ? In reply to this question, I at once say by hemor- rhage, suffocation, inanition and laryngitis. Hemorrhage, may cause death in either of two ways, viz :â€”^by suffocation, or exhaustion. The former may be effected thus: a portion of blood immediately after the infliction of the wound pre- sents itself, for admission, to the opening of the glottis, which is now imcovered, the epiglottis having been removed in the manner before stated; this may be prevented by the spasmodic action of the arytenoid muscles wliich naturally close the rima; resphation is thus suddenly interrupted, and should the spasm continue many seconds, hfe must become extinct. Now, let us suppose that the spasmodic action of the muscles, which closed the rima, lasted but an instant, and that it quickly became dilated by the action of the antagonist muscles, what would be the probable conse- quence ? Why, that the blood which had presented itself for admission, and had not as yet time to coagulate, would not only be admitted into the larynx and trachea, on me-

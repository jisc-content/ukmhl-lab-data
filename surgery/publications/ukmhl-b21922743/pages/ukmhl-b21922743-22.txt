6 CLINICAL SURGERY. important phenomena wliich relate to the medical profession. There are numerous well-known facts connected ^vith the animal economy, wliich cannot be explained by the light of science, or revealed by our present doctrines of final causes. Eor instance, what physiologist of the age can teU why the brain is the seat of the intellectual faculties, or how it per- forms its functions ? We cannot explain how the nerves feel or the stomach digests; and we are likewise ignorant of the manner in wliich glandular secretion is accomphshed. Our present knowledge of the laws of the animal economy does not enable us to account for these interesting pheno- mena, yet we are convinced of the facts, by the unques- tionable authorities of observation and experience. Gentle- men, in making these statements, my object is neither to discourage you, or mystify your studies; but to convince you, if I can, of the absolute necessity of personal obser- vation in acquiring di. practical knowledge of your profession. This kind of information cannot be acquired by reading and attending lectures only. No; the symptoms and effects of disease can be but imperfectly described by the best lectu- rers ; and why certain articles of the Materia Medica pro- duce their specific influence on the human body, and on the disease, for the cure of which they are administered, could never be foretold by reasoning from their chemical proper- ties. It was neither by our knowledge of the laws of the animal economy, nor those of chemistry, that we have learned that ammonia is a stimulant, opium a sedative, hippo an emetic, &c. &c. No; our information, on these subjects, has been derived from observation and experience j yes, ob- servation at the bed-side of sickness, and experience in the Avide field of disease!

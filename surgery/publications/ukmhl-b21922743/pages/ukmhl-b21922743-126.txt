CLINICAL SURGERY. 110 post-mortem examination, copious extravasations of blood, and depressed bone have been discovered; which it is but reasonable to suppose, contributed largely to, if not the sole cause, of the previous symptoms. I have repeatedly seen cases of this description, and I have no hesitation in assert- ing, that it is impossible for the most experienced surgeon, to form a correct opinion as to the precise nature, of a case of severe injury of the brain, by an abstract consideration of the symptoms only. The great majority of the cases of injury of the brain, which you shall meet in practice, \\tU be of a mixed character; the symptoms being in part caused by concussion, and in part by compression : in fact, similar symptoms may arise from either of these causes, taken sepa- rately, or acting conjointly.

LECTURE VI. m toms. This was serious, I will add, awful doctrine; the promulgation of which, has led to most disastrous conse- quences. Judging from the cases on record, I have no hesitation in stating my conviction, that Mr. Pott and his followers, killed, at least two patients, for the one they saved by the operation. If the operation itself could do no harm, why, we need not hesitate in performing it in certain cases, although the symptoms should not be very urgent; but if on the contrary, it can be shown that it may cause death, you must at once perceive that it is wrong to have re- course to it, except in cases where it cannot render the patient's condition worse than it was before, and that there is good reason to suppose it may prove useful. That the operation is in itself dangerous you will, I tliinlc, readily admit, when I relate to you a few cases illustrative of tlie truth of my assertion. The late Dr. Colles was in the habit of statins: in his lectures, that about sixty or seventy years ago, there was a Dr. E 1 in this city, who fancied that insanity was often the consequence of a want of due proportion, between the size of the brain and the cavity of the cranium: in short, that the brain had not sufficient room to perform its functions, and the consequence was madness He accord- ingly persuaded hitnseK, "that if there was a large hole (a foreamen magnum superior) made in the roof of the skuU, that it would be productive of the double advantage of reheving the brain from the uudue restraint imposed on it, by the comparatively small size of the skull, and of ad- mitting, at the same time, the fresh air, to cool the over- heated organ." Strange as it may appear, tliis doctor was allowed to test the validity of his theory in Swift's hospital;

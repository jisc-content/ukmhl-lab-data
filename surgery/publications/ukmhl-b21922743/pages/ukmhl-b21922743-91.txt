TEMPORAL ANEURISMS. 75 or four days longer, by wMch time the parts affected wiU have become consoHdated and all danger of secondary he- mon-hage or the formation of an aneurism passed away. Such IS the plan of treatment I thmk most advisable to adopt in cases of obstmate hemorrhage from the temporal artery when caused by a simple incised wound, but, if the wound were attended with contusion or laceration as frequently happens, then the treatment should be somewhat different from what I have described. For instance, in the latter case, it would be perfectly useless to attempt union by the first intention, inasmuch as the Hps of the wound would not be in a condition susceptible of adhesive inflammation. The best practice to adopt m this case, after the complete division of the artery had been effected, would be to dress the wound from the bottom with compresses of hnt, previ- ously dipped m some efficacious slyptic, such as a saturated solution of alum, or sphits of turpentine. The compresses may be removed with safety on the fourth day; by this time aU tendency to hemorrhage wiU have ceased, and suppuration havmg been fuUy estabhshed in the wound, the dressing WiU come away with facihty. The wound may now be dressed with shnple ointment, and in a few days the cure will be complete. What I have already stated relative to the pathology of tramnatic bracliial anemism, is strictly apphcable to the aneurisms produced by wounds of the temporal arteries. I ^ not, therefore, delay you wi'th a superfluous description of phenomena, with which you are already acquainted, but at once proceed to enquire in what state may a siu-geon find a temporal aneurism ? He may be called on to fa-eat such a case m any one of the three foUowing stages.-Krst, when

this objection, I will, in the first instance, proceed with CHAPTER ly. LECTURE lY. Injuries of the head and their varieties.—Anatomical peculiarities of the scalp.—Contusions of the scalp and their effects.—Bloody tumours and their modifications.— Simple-incised, lacerated, and contused wounds of the scalp, and the bad consequences which may result from them.—Erysipelas in general.—Idiopathic, and traumatic erysipelas of the head and face, ilhistrated by cases.— Practical remarks on the cases. Gentlemen, I wisli to call your attention^ on the pesent occasion^ to injuries of the head; they are so frequently to be met with in practice, so variable in their nature, and often so serious in their consequences, that they deserve the most attentive consideration of the student. With a view to simplify the study of the subject as much as possible, I will commence by asking, how may injuries of the head be divided in reference to the parts affected ? The reply to this question, is simple and easy of comprehension—viz., into those whicli affect the scalp—those wliich affect the skull itself—and those which affect the unportant parts contained witliin it. However, you are to bear in mind, that this an-angement is liable to objection, uiasmuch as we frequently meet with cases in which all the parts I have enumerated are simultaneously implicated.

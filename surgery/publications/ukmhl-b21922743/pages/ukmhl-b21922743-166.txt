CLINICAL SURGERY. 150 tity of blood flowed from the wound, whicli was immediately sponged ont and the bone exposed. It was then ascertained, beyond aU doubt, that a very extensive fracture traversed the parietal bone, and the crown of the trephine was applied at once. As soon as the saw began to work, it became ob- vious by the motion of the portion of bone, upon which it was placed, that the fracture was very extensive. The re- collection of the incomplete state of the sutui'es, in so young a subject as the patient happened to be, easily accounted for the mobihty of a larger piece of bone than could possibly be included within the crown of the trephine. After a short tim^ the unsteady state of the bone rendered it neces- sary to lay aside the saw altogether. The operator had now recom'se to a strong pair of forceps, and without much ex- ertion removed, at least one-half of the parietal bone. This was followed by a copious flow of blood, which had been confined between the skull and dura-mater: this membrane had been detached to a considerable extent, from the skull aU around the opening, and at the centre it was depressed at least an inch below its natural level. On the escape of the blood, the patient opened his eyes, and appeared to be somewhat better, but he soon again fell off into a lethargic slumber. The brain did not resume its natural position on the removal of the blood and bone with which it had been compressed. The wound, was lightly dressed, and general directions given to the nurse, as to what she ought to do for the patient during the night. On the next morning there was but little change for the better observable; however, on gently separating the bps of the wound, it became obvious, that the brain had in some degree, succeeded in attempting to recover its natural level; but as

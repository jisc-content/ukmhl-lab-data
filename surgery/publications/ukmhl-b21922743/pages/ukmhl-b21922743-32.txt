CLINICAL SURGERY. 16 and polislied.^ exliibiting many of tlie characters of serous membraneSj to wliicli it bears a close analogy, both as re- gards its natural appearance and tlie pathological changes to wliich it is hable. However, as it differs from them in some respects, wliich on the present occasion I do not feel it my duty to specify, it is usually referred to the " unclassi- fiable membranes" of Bichat. The middle coat is com- paratively strong, and obviously composed of yeUowish fibres, wliich run chiefly in a circular direction. These fibres have been considered by some physiologists to possess mixed properties, beiag partly muscular, and partly elastic; wlule others maintaia that they are not endowed with any of the attributes of muscularity. It would be foreign to our present purpose to canvass in. detail the conflicting opi- nions wliich have been advanced on this subject; let us, therefore, content ourselves with the recollection of the im- portant fact, that aU parties agree in assigning to those fibres a power of seK-contraction, with wliich they are certainly endowed. The external coat is usually called " cellularhowever, you are not to infer from this circum- stance, that it is natui'aUy loose in its texture; the very reverse being the fact. Indeed, it is only by protiacted maceration that it can be reduced to anything resembling " ceUnlar tissue." The general description which I have now given you of the structure of arteries, wiU not apply either to those of the bram, or the nutritious arteries of bones, which are divisible into two coats only. Taking an artery as a whole, we say it is well organized, inasmuch as it receives a tolerably good supply of those "systems" wliich are considered essentially necessary to per- fect organization; such as blood-vessels, nerves, exlialents,

CLINICAL SURGERY. 58 external one only; the two inner ones having given way in consequence of previous degeneration of structui'e. Before the time of Scaup a, the term true was apphed only to such aneurisms as owed their sacs to the weakened, and subse- quently distended state of all the coats of the artery; but since his work appeared^ surgeons are in the habit of assigning to the word a more comprehensive meaning. Traumatic cu-cumscribed false aneurism^ mustj as the name imphes, be the result of a wound in an artery by wliich all the coats have been divided^ so that the sac is formed altogether inde- pendent of them; by the condensation of the cellular mem- brane in the neighbourhood^ which is effected, partly by pressure and partly by the adliesive inflammation. The arterio-venous, or varicose aneurism differs but httle in its history or pathology from the one I have just des- cribed ; however, I feel that there are a few pomts of pecu- liarity which require explanation. I told you that in the former case not only the wounds in the skin but likewise those inflicted in the transfixed vein, had become perfectly healed before the compress and bandage had been removed from the patient's arm j I now apprise you that it some- times happens, although the wound in the skin and in the anterior wall of the vein may have healed by the first intention; yet, that the posterior wound in the vein, and the one in the anterior wall of the arterj', may have been but imperfectly closed. In a case of tliis kind, an aneuris- mal tumour may, according to the principles I have already explained, be estabhshed in the cellular tissue situated between the vein and the artery, communicating anteriorly with the former, and posteriorly with the latter. Under such circumstances, it is ob\aous, that the blood contained

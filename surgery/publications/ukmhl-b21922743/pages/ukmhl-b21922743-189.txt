LECTURE VII. 173 that it will be removed ultimately by judicious treatment. Topical bleeding, by means of leeches, should now be adopted, and calomel and opium given internally : two grains of calomel and half a graiu of opium, made into a pill, and given every tliird hour until the system shall be brought under the specific influence of mercury, will, perhaps, be the most useful combination you can prescribe. The day after the leeching, a large bhster ought to be applied over the ab- domen. Some physicians object to the practice of apply- ing a bhster over the leech-bites, on the ground that the flies may be absorbed and produce strangury; whilst others, with a view to prevent such an occurrence, sapiently recom- mend bits of silver paper to be placed on the leech-bites, and then the bhster to be apphed over all! This is an absurd way of trifling with such an important subject, and I mention it merely for the purpose of cautioning you against being in- fluenced in the treatment of so formidable a disease, by any such frivolous and secondary considerations. If you tliink a bhster likely to prove useful in such a case, apply it by all means, and without the shghtest hesitation. The fact of the leech-bites being present should not deter you from ap- plying it directly over them; on the contrary, as it is, chiefly, on the principle of counter-irritation that blisters prove useful, the fact of there being leech-bites beneath, is calculated to increase their efficacy.

You should, therefore, be very careful in preventing your patients, making too free in any way which

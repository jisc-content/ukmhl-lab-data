156 CLINICAL SUllGERY. ' Decemler 1st.—vSlept well last iiiglit, and is very much improved tliis morning: lie is quite aware of the calls of nature, and gets out of bed to reheve liiniself; liis gums are swollen, and his breath foetid from the mercury; he looks intelligent, and replies to questions rationally; pulse ninety-six. I gave directions to have the mercury omitted, and beef- tea to be given in small quantities tlu-ee or four- times during the day. The wound wliich had been poulticed during the last two days looked tolerably well, and the dura-mater pre- sented a healthy appearance. Erom this day he continued to improve up to the ninth of January, by wliich time the wound had healed, and with the exception of a defective memory he left the hospital quite well. CASE. September 'i'dth.—Peter Walsh, aged twenty-six, a painter, was brought to the hospital tliis morning, labouiing under the following symptoms :—He was quite insensible; extrem- ities cold; pupils fixed; respiration stertorous ; pulse forty- six, and compressible; constant di-awing up of the lower extremities. Over the left eyebrow there was a lacerated wound an inch and a half in leng-th, laying bare the frontal bone; a large portion of which was detached, the supercil- iary ridge being included and considerably depressed : the orbital jjlate was fractured and moveable. A large wound of the scalp at the back of the head denuded the occipital bone; and in addition to these injui-ies there was a simple fracture of the right femur. It appeared fi-om the state- ment of the persons who accompanied him to the hospital.

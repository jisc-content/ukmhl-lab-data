CLINICAL SURGERY. 190 poucli, or recess, formed between this membrane and the abdominal muscles. During the efforts made to restore the intestine, the patient was very restless and unmanageable, holding his breath, and otherwise resisting the efforts made to relieve liim. It was now deemed advisable to have blood taken from his arm, and when about twenty ounces were drawn, he became quite exhausted and pulseless; the skin being covered over with cold perspiration. Whilst in this state, the protruded intestine was retm-ned into the cavity of the abdomen without any difficulty whatever : the hps of the wound were kept together by two points of suture, sup- ported by a compress, and bandage, wliich were apphed with a moderate degree of tightness. This being done, the patient was placed on liis back, with pillows under his head, shoulders, and hams, with a view to relax the abdominal muscles as much as possible. Vdtli.—He slept but Httle during the night; vomited three or four times; he now complains of exquisite pain in the abdomen, which obliges him to scream whenever he makes a full inspiration; he cannot bear to be touched or moved in the shghtest degree; the countenance is sharp and anxious, tongue brown; excessive tliirst; and no se- cretion of mine; he was bled again, and ordered a grain of opium and two of calomel every hour. Two o'clock, p.m.—The bleeding produced fainting; he has been exceedingly restless since the last ^asit, and suf- fered much from thirst and vomiting; the bowels have been moved, but no secretion of urine has taken place; at present he lies in rather a torpid state; \vith mucli heaWng of the chest; the respirations are forty in a minute; tlie pulse is exceedingly quick and almost imperceptibly small.

There are many diseases with wluch peritoidtis may be confounded; you should, therefore, study them and make yourselves acquainted with their diagnostic symp- toms. Cohc is a disease wliich has some sjonptoms in common with peritoidtis; such as violent pain in the abdo- men and vomitiag; but, by a little reflection and inquiry you will be enabled to distinguish between them without much difficulty. In cohc, although the pain may be very violent, it is not of that lanciuating character which exists in peritonitis. I have already told you, that the pain attending peritoneal inflammation is increased on the shght- est pressure; such is not the case in cohc; on the contrarj', pressure seems to have an opposite effect. You Avill often meet with patients suffering from cohc, forcibly pressing their hands, or a pillow against the abdomen, as a means of reheving the pain. In peritonitis the patient is affected with symptomatic fever, whilst in cohc, the constitutional derangement, wliich exists, is not of a febrile character. Thus, then, you perceive that the two diseases which may, and often have been confounded and mistaken by ignorant practitioners, can, by a calm consideration of exist- ing symptoms, be deprived of their appai-ent analog)^ Retention of urine and peritonitis have sometimes, cer- tain symptoms in common, wliich have often led to fatal mistakes in practice. The symptoms to which I aUude, are pain and swelling in the hypogastric region, attended with a frequent desire to make water; only a small quantity of wliich comes away, wlulst the urgent desire to pass more contiimes.

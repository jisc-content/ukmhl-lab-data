Practical Observations. By a little reflection on the cases I have just read, you Avill find the followmg points deserving of consideration :— In the first place, you should bear in mind that the patients were admitted into the hospital during the second stage of the disease; that they were all cured by opium; wliilst the time and the quantity of opium necessary to effect a cure varied in a remarkable manner m each case. T'or instance. Hardy was admitted on the second of December, and slept the next day, having taken only tAvo hundred and ten drops of the acetum opii. Evans was admitted on the fifth of November, but did not sleep before the evening of the tenth, having in the interim, taken five hundred and forty drops of the acetum opii; whilst Conlan, who was admitted on the twenty-ninth of October, did not sleep until the fifth of November, by which time he had taken one hundred and twenty drops of the tincture of opium, and nine grains and a half of muriate of morphine.

114 CLINICAL SURGERT. the present exhausted state of the system^ such as blood, letting, &c., would be extremely dangerous, and should never be employed until reaction becomes fully established. Thus then, your first object in the treatment of such a case, shovdd be to bring about reaction by mild and soothing remedies. For tliis purpose, heaters should be apphed to the extremi- ties, or to the epigastrium; and sternutatories to the nose â€¢ a turpentine enema might also be administered -nith advan. tage. The propriety of giving stimulants iutemaUy is very questionable; indeed, for my own part, I always omit them for the following reasons. In the first place, the patient being unable to swallow, if wine, brandy or ammonia, were poured down liis throaty tJiere would be danger of suffocation, from then Habihty to pass into the larynx and trachea. Secondly, when the Adtal powers are much depressed, strong stimulants are exceedingly hazardous. If we wish to rekindle the dying embers of a half-extinguished fire, we would not have recourse to the strong blasts of a large bellows for the purpose; knowing as we do, from experience, that if we did so, the effect would be fatal to the object we had in view. Is it not, therefore, fair to infer, although the smnle may be somewhat strained, that by over-stimulating the few sparks of vitahty wliicli still remain, instead of resuscitating the patient, we might ex. tinguish Hfe itself! If, on the other hand, he should sur\dve the administration of stimidants, may they not do mischief by contributing to the inflammatory action, which is sure to follow in such cases ? Let us now suppose that reaction has been fully estab- lished, and inquire what should be the surgeon's next ob- ject? Inasmuch as a high and dangerous degree of inflam-

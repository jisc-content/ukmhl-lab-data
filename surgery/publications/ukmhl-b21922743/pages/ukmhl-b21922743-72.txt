CLIKICAL SURGERT. 56 ' pose that in performing the ordinary operation of vensesec- tion, that the operator selected the median basilic vein, where it crosses the bracliial artery, and that he plunged the lancet in with sufficient force to transfix the veia, pene- trate the fascia and bicipital aponeurosis, and open the anterior wall of the artery, to understand what must imme- diately follow. On the withdrawal of the lancet, the wound of the artery would at once be announced, by the impetuous iTish of a stream composed of both venous and arterial blood tlKough the wound. If pressure were now made on the brachial artery at some distance above the wound, the velocity of the stream would, at once, be diminished, and its venous character become more apparent than before; but if the pressure on the artery be discontinued for a moment, the blood will rush out "jper saltnm" with its former im- petuosity, and of a brighter colour; showing plainly that the artery had contributed largely to the common stream. We will now suppose that the operator bound up the wound with compress and bandage, and that the patient not having suffered much inconvenience from their appHcation, was satisfied to allow them to remaiu on for two or three days after the operation, when they were for the first time re- moved. The following would then be the probable appear- ance which the hmb would present:â€”the external, or cutaneous wound, would be healed by the adliesive inflam- mation ; the skin for some distance around it would be of a bluish tint, indicating that some blood had been effused beneath it; the wounds in the vein would likewise have been united by the first intention, wlulst only a partial agglutination of the hps of the wound in the artery had taken place. Should the compress and bandage be now

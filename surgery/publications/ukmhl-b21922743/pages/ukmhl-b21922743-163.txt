147 HERNIA CEREBRI. morbid state increasing, one or more vessels give way, and an effusion of blood into the brain ensues; wliich, if the skull were entire, would probably occasion apoplexy, but when there is a deficiency of bone that allows it to expand, presses the sm-face of the brain and its membranes tlu-ough the vacant space. The dura-mater soon ulcerates, and the tumom- pushing tlu-ough the opening, now increases with a rapidity proportioned to that with wliich the hemorrhage takes place within. At last the pia-mater and the sti-ucture of the brain, which covers the effused blood, are so extend- ed as to give way and the blood oozes out and coagulates. Thus, the quick growth, and aU the other phenomena obsei-vable in these tumom-s, are satisfactorily accounted for." There are some points in which I do not agree with Mi, ABERNETuys views On the subject. In the first place, I tliink he over-strains the analogy, which exists only to t. moderate extent, between tliis case and one of simple apo- plexy; and again, I am unwilling to subscribe to the opinion that it is by the process of ulceration, the dura-mater is destroyed, so as to admit of the protrusion of the brain The dura-mater is not at aU likely to become ulcerated from any pressure which such soft materials as coagulated blood and bram could produce. Again, when speaking of such cases, whilst he admits the inutihty of local apphcations to the tumour itself, he recommends the removal of an ad- ditional portion of bone, for the purpose of reheving the bram from pressure. This appears to me such equivocal practice, that I cannot recommend its adoption. The great majonty of those cases terminate fatally; however, as some ot them occasionally get well, you should not abandon any as beuig altogether hopeless.

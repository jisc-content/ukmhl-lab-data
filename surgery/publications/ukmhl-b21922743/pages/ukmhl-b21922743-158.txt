CLINICAL SURGERY. 142 time, when an extern patient presented himself to get a wound in his head di-essed, and that it was discovered a fractui-e existed^ for the surgeon to send liim home to his lodgings, and at the same time give directions to the hospital porter to follow liim, "when the hurry of the morning visit was over, and shave his head and seal;/) him, and that he would call liimself either in the course of that day or the next to trepan him." Tliis statement, however strange or incredible it may appear to you, is critically true, and fully borne out by many passages in Mr. Dease^s book, fi'om which you may learn that in liis time it was not miusual to have the patient scalped one day, and trepanned the next. The hospital porter was in the constant habit of acting as a sort of pioneer to the surgeon, by shaving the head and completely removing an oval piece of the scalp, in order to make room for the crown of the trepan. It is unnecessary for me to teU you what a wanton piece of cruelty this was, the more especially when the patient possessed his usual seusibihty. The practice of removing a portion of the scalp, is not adopted by the surgeons of the present day for the foUoAving reasons :—^First, it is not necessary to do so, in order to remove a portion of the bone.—Secondly, it is conducive both to the formation of hernia cerebri, and permanent deformity. These objections to the old method of operating were forcibly urged by the late Mr. Hey of Leeds, some years ago, and their validity has been ac- knowledged by all subsequent writers on practical suiger3\ Gentlemen, I wOl now lay down for yom- guidance, some general precepts relative to the operation of trephining; the observance of which, wiH, I trust, assist you hereafter, when you shall have the management of dangerous cases,

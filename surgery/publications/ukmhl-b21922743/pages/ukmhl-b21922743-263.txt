247 LECTURE XI. iu one pai't we are told that the dog actuated by "a pecidiar anxiety to propagate the disease, he travels, indus- triously seeking for objects to bite and in a few lines lower down a most formidable description of the symptoms concludes with the following passage:â€”" There is seldom much miscluevous tendency in this variety of the disease; on the contrary, some are to the full, as mild and tractable as at any other time, and show not the smallest disposition to bite throughout." Now, I repeat it, how is it possible for us to form a correct opinion, from such a description, as to what assemblage of symptoms constitutes the disease in a dog, by which he is enabled to communicate by inocu- lation, a complaint to the human siibject, the pathognomonic symptom of which (di-ead of water,) never existed in the animal at any stage of its illness ? Gentlemen, I feel that the discussion of this knotty question would be premature just now, I will therefore, postpone it, until after we shall have considered the subject in a general way. Let ns now inquire what are the alleged primary causes of the disease as it appears in the canine and fehne species ? I have aheady stated, that it may originate in these animals and so I believe it may, just as typhus fever or smaU-pox may attack the human race without our being able, in many instances, to account for the supervention of these formidable complaints. "We know equally weU, that when these diseases are once estabhshed, they may be propa- gated in either of two ways, namely, by contagion or inocu- lation. That animals previously in good health may become affected with hydrophobia, independently of inoculation, is a fact so generally admitted, that it would be an idle waste of time to dwell upon its consideration. It was formerly sup-

CLINICAL SURGEUT. 148 The second form of lierxiia cerebri, consequent on the operation of trephining, is very different in many respects from the one I have described. In this case the dura- mater remains unopened, and constitutes a sort of capsule for the tumour. The appearance of the surface will depend on the state of its dura-matrel investment; you will, accord- ino-lv, find it at one time of a dirty ash colour, attended with a copious fojtid discharge; whilst perhaps, at anotlier stage of the same case, it will be villous and red, Avith a healthy discharge. As to density, the tumour will likewise vary in different stages of its growth and decay. Tor ex- ample, so long as it continues to increase in size, it will be tense and elastic; but as soon as it begins to decline, it will become soft and lose its elasticity, and convey to the touch, the idea that it is composed of something of a semifluid consistence. In my opinion extravasated blood has notlung whatever to do with the formation or composition of these tumours; but that they consist altogether of organized brain, covered with its proper membranes, which gradually yielded to the continued force of the heart's action, inces- santly appHed at the base of the skull, whilst the natural boundary of the brain was rendered defective superiorly by the trepan-hole. I remember having seen, some years since in the Meath Hospital, a very interesting case of injury of the head, which bears strongly on our present subject. I have not the notes of the case at present, but I distinctly recollect aU the important points connected with it, which were as follow :â€” CASE. Patrick Moran, aged fourteen years, was accidentally

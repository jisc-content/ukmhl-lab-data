132 CLINICAL SUnCERY. pect of doing him any service whatever! Supposing he did find a fracture what advantage could result from the discovery? None^ whatever; on the contrary, by such a pro- cedure, the case would be rendered worse than before; for in addition to the objections I have already made, he would then have converted a sunple, into a compound fracture. It is true that the surgeons of former years, if they found a fracture, no matter how simple, would not rest satisfied with having done so much mischief; no, they would then proceed to trepan the patient, being under the impression that it was necessary to do so, in order to prevertt the occui-rence of bad symptoms. How such absm-d notions, could at any age, get possession of the human mind is diffi- cult to conceive; yet, unfortunately the facts on record are too numerous, and too well authenticated, to admit of any doubt on the subject. In cases of fracture with obvious depression of the bone, but unattended with a wound, or bad constitutional symptoms, the rule of practice at the present day, is not to cut down through the scalp; but to treat the patient antiphlogistically on prophylactic principles. It is well known that such cases very often get weU under tins treatment, without any operation whatever; and in young subjects the depressed portion of bone after some time, occasionally acquires its original level. In cases of compound fractures attended with depression, and shght constitutional disturbance, there is a difference of opinion amongst the surgeons of the present day, as to what ought to be done in the first instance. Some maintain that the bone should not be disturbed, that the wound ought to be closed over it, and the patient treated antiplilogisticaUy, and that in the event of bad symptoms occurring afterwards.

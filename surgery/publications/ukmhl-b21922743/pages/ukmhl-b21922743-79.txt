LECTURE III. 63 the coDoipress. I would now apply a new roller with, a moderate degree of tightness, and direct a continuation of the antiphlogistic plan of treatment, with some mitigation, for at least a week longer. By this time the wound in the artery will, m aU probabihty, have healed and the habihty to aneurism passed away. I have known two cases treated in this way with complete success; one by the late Mr. T. EojfEY, the other by the late Mr. Todd, both gentlemen of liigh professional attainments and of well merited distinction. I must now apprise you of the chcumstances which would render a perseverance in the plan of treatment I have just described, both impracticable and improper. For example, if in a few hours after the application of the compress and bandage, the patient complained of intolerable pain and tension in the hmb, and that he earnestly insisted on then- removal, the inference to be draMTi is that although there is no bleeding externally, yet, that a diffused false aneurism is being formed by the effu- sion of arterial blood beneath the skin and fascia. If such be the case, the removal of the bandage will afford the patient great reHef from the pam and tension, whilst the limb wiU present a swollen appearance, more especiaUy along the course of the bracliial artery. If the extravasated blood have coagulated, the swelhng wiU be firm and attended ^vith httle or no pulsation; but if, on the contrary the effused blood still retain its fluid state, the swelhng will be comparatively soft, and attended with a sort of undulatory pulsation; winch wiU be more distinct in the neighbourhood ot the axtery than in any other paxt of the tumour.

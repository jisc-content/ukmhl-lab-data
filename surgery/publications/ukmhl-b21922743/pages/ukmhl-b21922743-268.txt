252 CLINICAL SUUGEIIY. twenty bitten, is subsequently attacked with liydropliobia. Dr. Hamilton, who has taken great pains to obtain infor- mation on this subject, is of opinion that not more than one out of sixteen persons, bitten by rabid animals, become afflicted with the disease. Tlie comparative inaptitude on the part of the human subject, to become affected by hydi-ophobia, may be accounted for in two ways :â€”Firstly, a want of constitu- tional predisposition or susceptibility. Secondly, the in- complete apphcation of the virus, which must occur in many instances. I'or example, if a person should be bitten through two or tlu-ee layers of clothing, the poisoned saliva will not be inserted into the wound, the teeth having been cleaned before they inflicted it. That the effect is modified in this way, is well known from experience, for the chance of the disease succeeding a bite, is much greater when a person happens to be bitten on a naked part, than if it were inflicted thi-ough the clothes. The consequence is, that the bites of those animals which usuaUy aim at the face, such as the wolf, Ssc. are much more dangerous than of those, which appear to be indifferent as to the parts they lay hold of. Twenty-thi-ee persons were on one occasion bitten in Prance by a wolf, and thirteen of them subsequently died of hydrophobia. In another in- stance twenty-four persons were bitten near Eochelle, and eighteen of them got the disease, and of course died. Per- haps in addition to the explanation I have now mentioned, the fact of the woH inflicting a deeper wound than the gene- rality of dogs are capable of doing, may be considered an another reason why the bite of the former is more dange- rous than that of the latter.

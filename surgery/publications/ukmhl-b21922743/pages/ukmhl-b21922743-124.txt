CLINICAL SURGERY. 108 " Tliese several stages vary considerably in tlieir degree and diu-ation; but more or less of each will be found to take place in every instance where tbe brain has been violently shaken. Wliether they bear any certain propor- tion to each other or not^ I do not know. Indeed tliis ViiW depend upon such a variety of circumstances in the consti- tution, the injury, and the after-treatment that it must be dif&cult to determine." Such is Mr. Abernethy^s descrip- tion of the stages and symptoms which characteiize every bad case of concussion. In a subsequent page (92) IMr. Abernethy undertakes to point out to his readers, how to distinguish by symptoms, between concussion and com- jDression. " It has (continues Mr. Abeunethy) hitherto been con- sidered as a desirable object, to point out any marks by which we might distinguish between compression and con- cussion of the brain; but I beheve no such criteria have yet been communicated to the pubhc. If we judge of the symptoms of compression from what occurs in cases of apoplexy, or from cases Hke those which have been related of the rupture of the middle artery of the dura-mater, we must, I think, be of opinion, that pressm-e on the brain occasions insensibihty, partially, or generally, and in a de- gTee proportionate to its quantity. In extreme cases, such as I have cited, the insensibihty is manifested by every cir- cumstance. The pupil of the eye is dilated and cannot be made to contract, even by a strong hght. The respiration is slow and stertorous, and the pulse proportionably slow and labouring. There is no vomiting, which Avould mdicate sensibility of the stomach. The hmbs ai'e relaxed as in a person just dead. No struggles take place, no signs of

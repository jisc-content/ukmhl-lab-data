70 CLINICAL SURGERY. mth. wliicli lie combined the Yalsalvian plan of treatment constitutionally. In two of these cases tliis method of treatment x^roved snf&cient to accomplish perfect cures without causing obhteration of the arteries engaged. In the third case the sac, unfortunately, gave way and a diffused aneurism was the consequence, wliich was afterwards success- fully treated by the ligature, as in the cases I have just mentioned. In Scaepa's work on aneurism, you wiU fuid an interesting account of the effects produced by pressure, both as regards the state of the artery engaged, and the aneurismal tumour itself. It appears from the post mortem examinations made by this distmguished writer, that the cure of circumscribed false anemisms at the bend of the arm, is usually effected without causing obliteration of the artery itself, or the lieahng of the wound originally inflicted in its parietes. In the dissections reported in Scarpa's work, the original aneurisms winch were cured by pressure, appear to have degenerated into small tumoui-s, consistmg of the fibrine of the blood, which had externally estabhshed a connexion with the cncumjacent cellular membrane, and internally with the aperture m the artery. In one of the cases described by tliis author, the inner part of the aneu- rismal opening was closed by a calcareous deposit. For the particulars of these cases I must refer you to the work I have mentioned. Tlie second method of treating cncumscribed traumatic aneurism at the bend of the arm is simple and easy of com- prehension : it consists in cutthig down on the artery and tying it with a single Hgature, immediately above the tumour. The aneurism itself is not to be cut into, but its removal left to the action of the absorbents, wliich seldom

80 CLINICAL SURGERY. when tlie scalp receives a smart blow from a blunt instru- ment, tlie blood-vessels wliicli happen to be situated between the part stricken, and the skull, will necessarily be ruptured; inasmuch as the bone beneath, will nort permit them to evade the destructive effects of the blow by yielding, as would be the case if a similar degree of injuiy were apphed to a soft part of equal vascularity, such as the calf of the leg, the fleshy part of the tliigh, &c. The anatomical position which the gi-eater part of the effused blood must occupy, is between the expanded tendon of the occipito- frontahs muscle and the pericranium, where the cellular membrane is loose and reticular, for its reception. The bloody tumours caused, by contusions of the scalp, present themselves under various forms. In some instances, they are small and of sohd consistence throughout their entire extent, in other cases they violl, perhaps, extend from the transverse ridge of the occipital bone, nearly as far forwards as the supercihary ridges of the frontal; being bounded both before and behmd by the attachments of the occipito- frontahs muscle. In such a case as tliis, the tumour is usually soft, at least, for some time after the injury, indi- cating the fluid state of the effused blood. In a third case, the tumour may be of moderate size, firm at the circumfe- rence, and soft in the centre; plainly showing that the blood had in part coagulated, whilst a portion still remains fluid. I am not aware that any writer has attempted to account for the various degrees of consistency wliich the blood constituting these tumours exliibits: however, obse^^'a- tion has induced me to beheve, that the problem can be fairly solved on physiological principles. You are, perhaps, already aware, that human blood con-

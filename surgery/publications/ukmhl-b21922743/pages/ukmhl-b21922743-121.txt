105 LECTURE T. tical point of view, as a due supply of blood; yes, I repeat it " a due supply" and no more, or no less. When the supply is deficient, as in cases of liemorrhage, the functions of the brain become almost completely suspended, and sjTicope is the consequence. If you closely observe a person previous to, or dm-ing a profound fainting fit, the following appearances must forcibly strike you. The patient will at first become weak; the lips and countenance pale; the forehead cold and bedewed with perspiration ; the eyes dull and languid; he then falls down perfectly uncon- scious of aU surrounding objects. If the pulse be now felt, it win be found to beat slowly and feebly; respiration is also slow, and carried on with the utmost calmness. This state of things having continued for a few minutes, the colour retm-ns to the cheeks and hps; the patient sighs, opens Ins eyes, and looks rather vacantly around; the pulse and respiration gradually return to their natural state, and the skin becomes warm. The first state of the patient, was the result of a deficient supply of arterial blood, in consequence of wliich aU the cerebral fmictions became more or less suspended for the time being; but, when the patient assumed a position favourable to its free return to the head, the brain became, as it were, resuscitated and enabled to per- form its wonted functions. "Wlien there is an excessive supply of blood in the brain, as in cases of apoplexy, you wS\ have loss of sense and voluntary motion, as in the former instance; but in other res- respects, the state of the patient -will differ materially from that I have described. For instance, the face will be flushed and swollen; the eyes suffused; respiration stertorous; the pulse may be fuU and labouring; or it may be irregular

LECTURE VI. 131 divided into simple and compound. Sir Astley Coopeu was the fii-st surgeon of eminence^ wlio applied this classifi- cation to such fractures. The local symptoms of a simple undepressed fi'acture, can never be ascertained unless the scalp were divided by the practitioner, in order to get a view of the bone. This would be a most unjustifiable piece of cruelty; provided, constitutional symptoms, of a most urgent nature, were not present. Indeed, it might so happen, that an examination of the external surface of the skull would not supply the information sought for : for ex- ample, m full grown persons, when the bones of the skull consist of two layers, or "tables," as they have been absurdly designated by the old anatomists, and an interme- diate diploe. This being the case, violence applied to the scalp may have the effect of breaking and driving in the inner layer, wlulst the external one may remain unbroken. I told you, on a former occasion, the best way of dis- tinguishing between a bloody tumom* of the scalp, and a depressed fracture unattended by a wound; I will not, therefore, detain you now with a repetition of my former statement. In this instance, although you may not be able to satisfy yourselves as to the exact nature of the case, you should not cut down on the bone, for the mere pm-pose of gratifying an idle curiosity; such a proceeding would be censurable in the extreme. Let us suppose for a mo- ment, that an over-officious practitioner had such a case, and that he cut down tlirough the sctdp and found the bone quite sound; what a lesson of humility this ought to teach such a rash and dangerous surgeon ! Here, he gave the patient unnecessary pain, and perhaps laid tlie foundation for an attack of erysipelas, and without the slightest pro-

32 CIINICAL SURGERY. of the fluid blood in tlie neiglibouring parts; so that the coming away of the hgatnre would, in all probabihiy, be attended with a secondaiy fatal hemon'hage. Thus, then, you may perceive that the operation of tying the external carotid would be both difficult and unsafe; and consequently, Hable to objections, wliich cannot be fairly advanced against the propriety of tying the common carotid, under the peculiar circumstances of the case before us. It is comparatively easy to expose the common carotid in the upper third of its course; and I am induced to thinlc, that the difficulty of passing a hgature around it, without including, or otherwise injuring the internal jugular vein or par-vagum, has been greatly exaggerated. I must say, that neither of these im- portant parts presented to me the shghtest obstacle in passing the aneurism needle, nor can I confidently assert that I saw them, at all, during the operation. However, be it remembered, that it became my duty to operate under rather embarrassing circumstances, and by candle-hght. The danger of secondary hemon-hage fi-om the common carotid, on the separation of the hgatm-e, is not, in my opinion, very great, provided the artery were in a healthy state previous to the operation. The fact of its not gi\Tng off any important branches from its origin to its termina- tion, is a circumstance conducive to the formation of a long coagulum; consequently, the adliesive process wliich is going on in the neighboui'hood of the hgature, is not very liable to interruption from the " vis-a-tergo^^ of the heart's action, or the circulation of the fluid blood. The next feature in the case which I deem worthy of ob- servation, is, the very distressing hiccough wliich occurred on the 3rd of Tebruary. Here, I may observe that the

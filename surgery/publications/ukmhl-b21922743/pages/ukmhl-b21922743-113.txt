97 ERYSIPELAS OF THE HEAD AND FACE. provement took place in the symptoms as soon as the mer- cury began to produce its specific effects. It is right that I should mention^ that stimulants were given in these cases, as long as the patients were able to swaUow, and that bhs- ters were applied between the shoulders, and to the calves of the legs; and sinapisms to the soles of the feet, wliich might, perhaps, have been of some service; but it is to the mer- curial treatment I attribute the recovery of the patients. In the great majority of cases of the superficial erysipelas of the scalp, the symptoms will become milder in the course of eight or ten days, but you cannot count on this as a matter of certainty, inasmuch as the disease may assiune the erratic form. When it does take a favourable tin:n, the tumid state of the parts subsides; the wound granulates and suppurates kindly ; the cuticle desquamates; the patient can now open his eyes, and a corresponding im- provement in the constitutional symptoms indicate a speedy recovery. In the plilegmonoid erysipelas of the scalp, you should, in the fiirst instance, try the effect of fomentations, and poultices frequently repeated during the day; saline purga- tives should likewise be administered; but if this treatment should not make a favourable impression on the symptoms in thirty-six hours, you should make a free incision through the swoUen part, and of sufiicient depth to divide the ten- don of the occipito-frontahs muscle. The incision ought to be made in the transverse direction; the object being to reUeve tension by enabUng the antagonising portions of the muscle to separate the hps of the wound. You should view a case of this kmd, in the same hght, and treat it on the same principle, you would one of deep-seated pa-

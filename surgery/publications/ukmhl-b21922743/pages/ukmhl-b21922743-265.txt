249 LECTURE XI. " In a memoir read to the Erencla Institute, M. Huzaru explained, that herbivorous quadrupeds affected with rabies are incapable of transmitting the disease; a position sub- sequently confirmed by additional experiments and observa- tions made in the veterinary school at AKort. M. Gibard and Yatel inoculated^ with the saliva of rabid sheep, two other sheep, a young dog, and a horse, but none of these animals evinced any symptoms of the disease and continued weU for four months after the experiment. Professor DuPTJY could never communicate the distemper to cows or sheep by rubbiag their wounds Avith a sponge which animals of the same class, already labouring under the disease, had in their mouths; though the same experiment made with a sponge which had been bitten by a rabid dog propagated rabies by a kind of inoculation. Dupuy has seen amongst several flocks, sheep aff'ected with rabies, yet the distemper was never communicated by them to other sheep, not- withstanding the latter were bitten on parts stripped of the wool. Doctor Gilman inoculated two rabbits with the saliva of a rabid pig; but the disease was not communicated to them. '^Another question of considerable importance is, whether hydrophobia (rabies) can be communicated from one human being to another, or whether in men the disease is infectious or contagious ? Many attempts have been made in vain, to communicate the distemper to several kinds of animals by inoculating them with the sahva of patients who had perished of the disease. These experiments were made in tliis country by Gatjthier, Yaughan, Babington, &c., but no infection was the consequence. In France Girard inoculated several dogs \nth the sahva of a man in the cou- M 2

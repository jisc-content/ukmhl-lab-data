lECTUKE XI. 257 the case vnQ. end favourably; at all events tlie present symptoms will pass away, inasmuch as ihe genuine hydro- phobia of canine origin never exerts its baleful influence in the human subject for many days, weeks, or perhaps months after the primary injury. There was a curious but very interesting case published in the London Medical and Sur- gical Journal some years since, to the following effect:â€” A gentleman was bitten by his own dog, after which the dog left home. As soon as it was missed, the owner became alarmed, fearing it had gone mad; he was seized with an aversion to fluids, and an inabihty to drink, and continued in this state for four days ; at the end of which time the dog returned in good health. On the master seeing that the animal was not mad he became delighted, and the hydrophobic symptoms instantly vanished. Traumatic tetanus is a disease, which may be mistaken for hydrophobia, in consequence of certain phenomena which both diseases have in common. The wound inflicted by a dog may cause either tetanus, or hydro- phobia ; both diseases are attended with paroxysms, a dis- agreeable sensation in the throat, attended with a difficulty of swallowing liquids, and pain in the epigastrium. Not- withstanding these points of similarity, it is by no means difficult, for a well informed medical man, to distinguish between the two diseases. For instance, tetanus generally commences, between the fourth and twentieth day, after the infliction of the wound; wMst hydrophobia seldom makes its appearance in the human subject, sooner than a month after the bite : in tetanus, the pathognomonic symp- torn of the disease, is a difficulty or impossibihty of opening the month, the inability to swallow, being only a secondary.

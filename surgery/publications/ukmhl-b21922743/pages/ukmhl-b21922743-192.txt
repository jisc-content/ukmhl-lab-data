176 CLINICAL SURGERY, is deficient posteriorly, at its inferior third, it is quite possi- ble that the matter, being firmly resisted in other directions, may gradually work its way downwards, until it shall have arrived at the peritoneum, and there by its presence produce inflammation of this membrane. Your knowledge of anatomy, the situation of the injury, and the symptoms of hemorrhage, will be sufficient to guide you in forming an opinion as to whether the epigastric or mammary arteries have suffered or not, in a case of abdo- minal wound. I remember having heard the late Mr. CoLLES relate a very interesting case of this description, which fell under Ms observation some years ago : as well as I can at present call to mind, the leading features of the case were pretty neai'ly as follow :â€”A carpenter, wliilst walking, stumbled, and fell upon the edge of a chisel, which he had imprudently tteust into his breeches-pocket; he was brought to Stevens' hospital immediately after the accident, and on examination a wound, corresponding in size with the shai-p extremity of the chisel, was discovered in the lower part of the abdomen. The patient, who was, on liis arrival at the hospital, pale and exhausted, gradually became weaker, cold, and pulseless, and in the course of a few hours after admission expired. On opening the body, some hours after death, the cavity of the peritoneum was found distended with blood, and the epigastric axtery completely di\nded. Thus, then, gentlemen, you perceive fi'om what I have stated, that wounds of the abdomen, although compara- tively superficial, may be productive of the worst results. Mr. CoLLEs's patient might, in my opinion, have died of hemorrhage, although the cliisel had never penetrated the peritoneum.

TEMPORAL ANEURISMS. objectionable for the following reasons:â€”a ligature so applied will not necessaiily cut off the supply of blood from the tumour in such a manner as to accomplish a cure^ inasmuch as the free anastamoses wliich exist between the branches of the temporal arteries of opposite sides^will furnish an abundant supply of bloody which will flow into the sac, at the distal side, and in this way, render the operation ineffectual, whilst the wound, irritated by the Ligature left in it, might give rise to erysipelas. My objection to the tliird method, apphes solely to the employment of ligatures, which I con- sider worse than useless, by acting as foreign bodies. The plan of treatment which I have found successful in all cases of temporal aneurism, no matter what may be the state of the parts at the time, is to open the tumour freely, so as to completely divide the artery, sponge out the blood, and dress the wound from the bottom with graduated com- presses of hnt, previously dipped in spirits of turpentine. These should be kept on by a roller applied with a mode- rate degree of tightness, and not removed sooner than the fourth day after the operation, when the wound will usually be found suppurating kindly. The case should now be treated in every respect, in the manner I have described, when speaking of obstinate cases of primary he- morrhage. Erysipelas is one of the bad consequences which may result from a wound of the scalp involving the temporal artery, the more especially if hgatures should be apj)lied to the vessel, or sutures inserted in the Avound; however, as this subject will occupy our attention on a futui-e occasion, I Avill not now further trespass on your time.

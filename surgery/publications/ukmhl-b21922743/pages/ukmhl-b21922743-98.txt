CLINICAL SURGERY. 82 distance over the surface of the tumid part; and if it were merely an extravasation of blood, the finger would, in the first instance, rise over the elevated margin of the swelling, and then sink into the httle well in the centre. If strong pressui-e be now made with the finger, the bone may be felt beneath, and no convulsive twitchings of the muscles or other symptoms indicative of compression of the brain ex- cited ; whereas, if the case were a depressed fracture only, the finger would not rise above the natural level of the scalp, previous to its sinking, into the cavity caused by the depressed state of the bone. In the latter case, pressure with the finger, would, in all probability, produce symptoms of compression, or increase those wliich may have previously existed. However, it must be admitted, that these diag- nostic marks, do not always prove satisfactory; indeed, in many cases attended with severe symptoms of cerebral injury, the best informed practitioners mil not, when first called on, be able to declare with certainty, the precise nature of the case. As a general rule, bloody tumoui-s of the scalp, unattended by injury of the brain or its mem- branes, are not serious cases, although sometunes slow m disappearing. I have remarked, that when the extravasated blood assumes a soHd form soon after the accident, it wiU be quickly absorbed; whereas, in cases where the blood re- mains fluid, its removal will not be affected for several days; or it may, perhaps, ultimately become necessary for the surgeon to open the tumoui-. Tliis is a practice, however, wliich should not be adopted hastily, inasmuch as a very bad description of inflammation often supervenes when bloody tumoui-s are prematurely opened; hence it is, that nothing but the urgency of the symptoms would justify a

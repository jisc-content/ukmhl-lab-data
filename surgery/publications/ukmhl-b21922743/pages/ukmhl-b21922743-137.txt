121 LECTURE V. need scarcely tell you that all tlie other cases terminated fatally. As to myseK I never saw a case of suppuration within the skull^ where the matter was only to be found on the cranial surface of the dura-mater.

If, for instance, a patient affected with a lacerated wound of the scalp should be attacked with common fever, the wound will put on the degenerated appearance I have described : again, if a piece of bone were seriously injured at the tune of the accident, and is in progress of exfohation, the wound will assume an unhealthy appearance, although the patient should in every other respect feel quite well. Much diff"erence of opinion has, for a long time, pre- vailed amongst surgeons, as to tlie best constitutional method of treating such contused wounds of the scalp as are, in the first instance, attended with symptoms of concussion of the brain, to a greater or lesser extent. It is the opinion of some practitioners that all cases of this kmd, should be treated antiplalogistically on prophylactic principles, for several days after then- infliction. These gentlemen assert that mflammation commences internally sooner than is generally thought after the prunary injury; and that it is G

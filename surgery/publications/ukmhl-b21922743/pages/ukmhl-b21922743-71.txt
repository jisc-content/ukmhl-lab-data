LECTURE III. 55 attended with a distinct pulsation^ which would be more remarkable in the course of the artery than at the cu'cum- ference. If a case of this description were allowed to run its own course, the following changes would, in all proba- bihty, take place in the arm. The tumefaction, tension, and pain, would aU increase in degree of severity; the patient would instinctively, keep the fore-arm iu a state of semi-flexion, in order to relax the fascia, and by tliis means alleviate the pain; matters will now proceed from bad to worse; inflammation becomes quickly estabhshed; a mode- rate degree of wliich will be quite sufficient to produce gan- grene in a hmb, in which the circulation had been con- siderably impeded, if not altogether obstructed by the pressure of extravasated blood in its vessels: gangrene having once commenced, it is impossible for the most experienced practitioner to predict with confidence, the extent to which it may proceed.

I have now given you a brief description of the cause, varieties, symptoms and pathology of the diffused false aneurisms, wliich you should be prepared to meet with at the bend of the arm; I will say nothing of the treatment wliich ought to be adopted in such cases, untfl I describe the other forms of tramnatic aneiuism which are hkely to occur in tliis locality. With a view to consider the exact nature of the circum- scnbed false aneurism, it is only necessary for you, to sup-

Under such circumstances the wounds should be poulticed, and it is probable, that in the course of a few days when all swelling has subsided, the catheter can then be intro- duced. The constitutional ti-eatment of a case of tliis description must vary in different instances, and be determined in a great measure by the sort of person ^iffected; the character of the symptoms, and the stage of the complaint.

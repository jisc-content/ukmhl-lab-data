CLINICAL SURGERY. 146 and appear to be tlie result of the operation of trephining. It occasionally happens that in the course of a few days after the operation, a soft pulsatory swelling will force its way up tlu-ough the trepan-hole, and gradually increase in size until it ^vill perhaps, ultimately become as large as a hen's egg. The appearance of the surface of the tumour will not be the same in all instances : in one case you may have it rough and irregular, of a dirty brownish appearance and emitting an offensive smeU. The consistence of the tumour in this case will be moderate, just what you would expect from a mixture of coagulated blood and disorganised brain. When the tmnour has attained the size I have mentioned, the constitutional symptoms will be those indi- cative of irritation and pressure of the braiu. Por example, it is by no means unusual, should the tumour be situated on the right side of the head, for the patient to become amaurotic of the left eye, or be attacked with convulsions or paralysis of the left leg or arm, or both at the same time. When these symptoms only exist in a partial degree, they may be increased by pressure appHed to the tumour : the pulse is usually quick, the intellect impaired, the appetite bad, and the constitution greatly deranged. In such a case of hernia cerebri as I have just described, there is much reason to suppose that the dura-mater was torn either at the tune of the accident, or by the teeth of the saw during the operation. As I consider Mr. Aber- nethy's description of this form of the disease tolerably correct—I vnR read it for you.—" Their formation seems to l)roceed from an injury done to a part of the brain by con- cussion or contusion, which has terminated in a disordered state of the vessel, similar to what occurs in apoplexy.

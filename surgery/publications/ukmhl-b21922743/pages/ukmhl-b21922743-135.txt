On examination after death, the scalp at the seat of the injury, may be found soft and tumid; and on being cut through some ill-conditioned matter mixed with gas may escape ; the bone itself \\t11 perhaps be denuded, the matter having formed between it and the pericranium.

There may be an effusion of sero-purulent matter between the pia-mater and the cerebral portion of the arachnoid membrane, or beneath the pia-mater on the surface of the brain: abscesses are often found tliroughout the substance of the brain, and inordinate quantities of se- rum in the ventricles.

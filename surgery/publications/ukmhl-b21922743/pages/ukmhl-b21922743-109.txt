ERYSIPELAS OF THE HEAD AND FACE. 93 during life, as being altogether sympathetically produced by the disease of the scalp. Wliether tliis gentleman changed his opinion or not previous to liis death I am unable to state; but this much, I respectfully assert, that judging from my own experience, liis original views were more ap- phcable to the exceptions than to the general rule. As I have already stated, it is not my duty here as a chnical lecturer, to enter into a formal dissertation on a disease wliicli has been incidentally brought under my notice ; I will not, therefore, delay you with a lengthened description of the treatment which ought to be employed in its various forms, but will now return to the special consid- eration of traumatic erysipelas of the scalp. Any species of wound of the scalp may cause erysipelas, but lacerated, and punctured are those which usually do so. There are two species of traumatic erysipelas of the scalp, viz : the superficial, and the deep-seated; it is a matter of much practical importance to keep this in mind. Lacerated wounds usually give rise, to the former, wliilst punctured womids produce the second fonn of the disease. The time wliich may elapse after the infliction of the wound, before the disease appears will vary in different cases ; it may come on in tliirty-six hours, or in any time previous to the lieahng of the wound; but it most frequently occurs on the third or fourth day. When the superficial form of the disease commences, the lips of the wound become dry and tumid, and the local symptoms, which I have already described, when speaking of idiopatliic erysipelas, gradually estabhsh themselves over the head and face. The symptomatic form will vary in type in different cases : in some instances it will run liigh, and partake of the sthenic character;

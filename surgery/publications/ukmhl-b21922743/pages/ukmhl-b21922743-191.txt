LECTURE VII. 176 necessity of being guarded in youi- prognosis and vigilant in yom- attention. In a case of tliis kind, the wound having been regularly dressed in the first instance, the patient should be kept perfectly quiet in bed for some time; and in the event of his complaining of pain or tenderness in the pai-t affected, in addition to the usual constitutional antiphlogistic remedies, leeches should be apphed in great numbers, with a view to prevent suppuration.

Here, I wish to remmd you, that when an abscess forms beneath a fibrous membrane, the constitutional symptoms do not suddenly subside when suppuration takes place, as in other cases, nor will the mat- ter arrive at the surface as soon as if it were otherwise cu-cumstanced. The difference does not appear to me to depend so much on the mechanical resistance, given by the fibrous texture, as on the scanty supply of absorbents which it receives; be this as it may, it is sufficient for our present purpose to recollect the important fact; and that in practice, we ought to assist nature in bringing the matter to the surface, by makiag a free incision into the tumour, as soon as we are satisfied that suppuration has taken place.

In the event of an abscess having formed within the sheath of the rectus muscle, you have something more to apprehend than the mere irritation resulting from the confinement of matter; for, inasmuch as the sheath

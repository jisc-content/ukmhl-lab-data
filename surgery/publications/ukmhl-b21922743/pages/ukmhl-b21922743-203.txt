In such a case tlie practitioner should studiously avoid purgative medicines; lest by their action an extravasation of feculent matter might be produced. Ojpium is the medicine best calculated to be of service m such a case, both by relieving pain and allaying local irritation in the wounded intestine. Let us now suppose a case of penetrating wound of the abdomen, in M^hich a portion of intestine, cut completely across to the mesentery, presents itself externally, and in- quire what the surgeon ought to do under such circum- stances ? Gentlemen, you will meet with much discrepancy of opinion when you read the various works wliich treat of this subject, as to what is the best line of practice to adopt in such a case as I now submit for consideration. Some of the old surgeons, amongst whom Ramdhor stands foremost, recommend that the superior portion of the di- vided intestine should be introduced some distance into the inferior one, and retaiaed there by means of sutures. The objections to this mode of proceeding are manifest and in- controvertible; in fact fhe practice in question was con- ceived not only in crude notions of mechanism, but in ignorance of the principles of pathology. It woidd be utterly impossible to introduce one portion of intestine within the other; unless a separation between the the mesentery and the former, were first effected; and this could not be done without destroying some of the mesenteric arteries, and thereby causing a serious hemorrhage. Again, the dilRculty of saving, or otherwise securing, in a satisfac- tory manner, the invaginated portion, must be very great; but, above all, the expectation that a serous and a mucous

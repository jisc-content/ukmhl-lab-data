Vni PEEFACE. I have not hesitated in expressing my opinion on what seemed to be founded in error, or calciilated to mislead the uninformed. The reader may, perhaps, discover something ]iovel in the following pages, either explanatory of facts previously known, or suggestive of original views. I will not venture to assert, that any explanations or opinions originating with myself, are Hkely to prove useful either to science, or the public; at the same time, I am inclined to tliink, that their calm consideration may be deemed interesting by the im- partial reader. As the Lectm-es were delivered extemporaneously, and subsequently prepared for the press, from notes taken at the time, I tnist that the reader will make allowance for the familiarity of style, and frequent repetition of trite sentences which pervade the work. It having been my duty to im- part information to a mixed audience, composed of students of different capacities, I felt I could accompHsh the object in view better, by addressing them in plain simple language, than by attending to select phraseology, and the formal construction of rounded periods.

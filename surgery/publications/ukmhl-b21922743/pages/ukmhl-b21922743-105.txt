Erysipelas wiU sometimes make its appearance without our being able to assign any cause, whilst in other instances we can fairly attribute its origin to local irritation; the patient having been predisposed to morbid action, either from a pecuhar state of the constitution or other circumstances. The records of medicine and surgery furnish abundant proofs that erysipelas maybe of endemic or epidemic origin; and that ua some rare instances, it can be fairly traced to contagion, is a fact winch must be admitted. The local symptoms of erysipelas mtU not be precisely alike in all cases, the difference being determined by the degree of inflammation and the textures uivolved.

The patient will complain of heat, and a smart prielding pain; but the sweUing wiU be inconsiderable. Should the skin be inflamed throughout its entire thickness, and the degree of inflammation be liigher than what I have described, you will, in addition to the symptoms I have mentioned, have an cedematous state of the part, and straw-coloured vesicles on the surface; these symptoms being the effects of the over distended state of the vessels of the skin.

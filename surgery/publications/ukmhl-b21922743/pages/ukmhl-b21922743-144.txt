128 CLINICAL SURGERY. effects of concussion only. My reason for thinking so is, the short time which elapsed after the accident, when re- action became estabhshed ; and, the rapidity with M'hich all the symptoms, with the exception of the bloody tumour, disappeared. There was not at any period, from the mo- ment of the accident, until he left the hospital, any symp- toms which would warrant the supposition, that inflamma- tion had taken place within the skuU. No j two of Mr. Abernethy's stages of concussion, were certainly, discerni- ble; indeed, I must say obvious; but fortunate^, the third never arrived. If compression existed at all, it must have arisen either from a depressed piece of bone, or extra- vasated blood. If it were produced by the former, it is not probable that the brain could so perfectly adapt itself to the exigency of the case, as to be able to perform its wonted functions in forty-eight hours after the accident! Again, if blood were extravasated in sufficient quantity to cause serious pressure on the brain, is it reasonable to sup- pose that the absorbents would remove it, in two days, and require twenty for the removal of what was effused extemally ? In the case of Owens it is probable that compression and concussion existed at the same time; for, although the skull had not been fractured, a blood-vessel within it, might have been ruptured, and in tliis way, the exti'avasated blood, assist in producing the symptoms. It is quite ob\dous that internal inflammation supervened on the second day after the accident; and, that it contributed much, both to the danger and complexity of the case. I tliink that the mer- curial treatment was of great service, not only as an anti- inflammatory remedy; but also by promoting absorption of

The di-essings may, with advantage, be wetted from tune to time with cold water j but they ought not to be removed for three or four days, provided the patient do not suffer from pain and tension in tlie parts en- gaged in the injury. By tliis time the adhesive inflaanma- tion wiU have closed up the mouths of the wounded vessels, and suppuration AviH be estabhshed, so that the compresses may now be removed with ease and safety. Wlien arteries of a moderate size have been chvided by a sharp-cutting mstrument, the bleeding may be restrained in many instan- ces, by shnply bringing the hps of the wound in contact with each othei;, and retaimng them in this position by su- ture and bandage. This is the practice usuaUy adopted after operations perfomed on the lips, either for the pur- pose of removing morbid stiucture, or curing congenital malfonnations. The suppression of hemorrhage hj torsion of the bleeding arteries was warmly taken up by the Continental surgeons some years smce, but I beheve it is seldom had recourse to at the present day, even by them, except in cases where the wounded vessels are smaU. Torsion, as far as I am inform- ed, was never thought much of as a means of arresting hemorrhage by the British or Irish surgeons. By those who have confidence in its occasional efiicacy, two methods of employkg it have been recommended. The first con- sists of merely taking hold of the extiemity of the bleeding vessel with a pair of forceps, and then forcibly twistinc. it round four or five times, so as to destroy its physical proper- ties, and thereby rendering it incapable of restoring itself to Its previous patulous conchtion, until such time as tlie ndhesive inflammation might accomplish its permanent ob-

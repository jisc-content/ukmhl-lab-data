PREFACE. The following pages contain the substance of a few Clinical Lectures, delivered by me, in the Jervis-street Hospital, together with an account of the cases which sug- gested them. The last chapter constitutes an exception to this statement; inasmuch, as the Lecture it contains M^as not delivered in the hospital, but in the School of Medicine, Ceciha-street. In pubhslung the Lectui-es, I am acting in conformity with the expressed desire of some of the pupils, who attended the hospital during the last Medical Session. I beheve every lecturer is occasionally asked by some of his pupils, when lecture is over, " what book he would recommend them to consult on the subject of the lecture.'''' I have often found it difficult to give satisfactoiy answers to such questions, when put to me, in reference to the sub- jects treated of in this work. ■\¥lien I express myself thus, I freely admit that a great deal of valuable information, relative to the subjects specially considered in this volume, may be found scattered tliroughout the works of former writers. Wliilst I gladly availed myself of the experience and labours of others, and carefully selected and aiTanged whatever appeared to me likely to be of use to the student.

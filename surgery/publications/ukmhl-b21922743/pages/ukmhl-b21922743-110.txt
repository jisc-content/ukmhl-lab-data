The second species of traumatic erysipelas of the scalp, differs in many respects from the one I have described: it is in almost every instance the efCect of a punctured wound, which involved the tendon of the occipito-frontahs muscle, and the subjacent ceUular tissue. The inflammation com- mences in these textures, and subsequently, extends to aU others in the neighbourhood. The swelling, in the first in- stance, is circumscribed and not very painful, but if left to itseK, it wiU quickly spread, become veiy tense and painful. In some cases the swelling will extend from the forehead, to the transverse ridge of the occipital bone, showing plainly that the chief cause of it, is situated beneath the occipito- frontaUs muscle; the attachments of which often define its circumference. The eyelids and ears are not usually included in this form of the disease; however, you are not to sup- pose that these parts always escape; I have seen cases of tliis description when they became involved at an advanced period of the disease. In the deep-seated or phlegmonoid erysipelas of the scalp, the local symptoms usually precede, and appear to be the exciting cause of the constitutional disturbance. You should bear this in mind as it ought to influence you in the line of treatment you would adopt in such cases. When called on to treat a case of traumatic erysipelas of the scalp, your first object should be to ascertain the precise character of the disease; should the wound be large, the swelling soft, the ears and eyehds included, and the accom- panying fever indicative of gastro-hepatic derangement, you may conclude that it is the superficial form of the disease

61 LECTURE III. Let us now, consider, for a moment what changes will occur ia the distribution of the blood in the hmb ? The alterations which must take place in this respect, are at once obvious and important. Eor iastance, the arterial blood wliich was intended for the nutrition of the fore-arm and hand, having been, by the accidental wounds in the artery and vein, suddenly interrupted in its course, and prematurely sent back to the heart; the consequence must be, a defective state of nutrition, followed by atrophy of the hmb, attended with a diminution of temperature, and loss of strength. It is scarcely necessary for me to mention, that both in varicose aneurism, and aneurismal varix, you are not only to expect the usual characteristic symptom of pulsation, but you will in addition, have it accompanied with a Inssing noise, and an undulatory tlirill; the former depending upon the fact of the arterial blood being forcibly driven tlirough the opening in the artery, either into the sac by which both vein and artery communicate; or directly into the vein; the latter being a continuation of the shock combined with the sudden claslnng of two currents of blood, naturally intended to run in opposite directions, through separate vessels. Gentlemen, having thus, given you a description of the various accidents and diseases which are Hable to occur from wounds of the blood-vessels at the bend of the arm, I wiQ now endeavour to point out to you the best methods of meeting those emergencies, by the employment of the re- sources which practical surgery can supply. Let us begin the consideration of tliis subject by asking what a surgeon ought to do, supposing he had reason to beHeve from the history of the case, and ocular evidence that the brachial artery had been wounded ? Under such circmnstances, if

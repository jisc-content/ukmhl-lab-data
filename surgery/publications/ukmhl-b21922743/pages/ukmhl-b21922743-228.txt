Tlu:ee of the worst cases of deli- rium tremens I ever knew to recover, Avere of this description. The subject of one of them was the proprietor of a public house, on the Coombe, who, whilst in a state of intoxica- tion, and during an altercation with liis wife, received a blow of a pewter quart on the head, wliich divided the temporal artery; lie lost a great deal of blood before I saw liim, and was attacked with dehrium tremens in thirty-six hours after the accident. The second case was that of a master tailor, who resided in Plunket-street: having spent two days fi'om home, during which period he was incessantly drinking, he retui'ned early one morning, " in puris naturalihus," and had the misfortune to meet his wife in the hall: he made a race up stahs; she seized a long deal stick, with a rough spiculated extremity, and pm'sued him; before he got as far as the first lobby, she made a violent thrust of the stick at him, which took effect m the posterior part of the scrotum, wliich was dreadfully lacerated, so as to denude the testicles, wluch were suspended, merely by the sperma- tic cords. Previous to my arrival at the patient's house, he lost a great deal of blood, but the bleeding had then ceased. I closed the hps of the wound, and kept them together by a few points of suture, aided by sticking plaster, and placed a piece of damp hnt over all. I then prescribed a full opiate draught, but it did not produce sleep, and the first stage of delirium tremens was estabhshed next day, and on the second he was almost unmanageable j however, he ulti- mately recovered. The tliird case was that of a butcher, in Ormond Market, who, wliilst in a state of intoxication.

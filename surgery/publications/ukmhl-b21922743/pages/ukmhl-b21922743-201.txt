185 LECTURE VIII. oue very interesting case myself, winch occm-red some years back, a few miles from Dublin, in wliich tliere was good reason to suppose tlie intestines bad been wounded, although no extravasation of their contents took place. The case was that of an unfortunate man who attempted to commit suicide by throwing himseK on the point of a smaU sword : the instiaunent entered the abdomen near the umbilicus, passed chrectly backwards and projected some inches through the integuments, in the neighbourhood of the spine. The late Mr. Thomas Eoney was immediately sent for, and on liis arrival, the friends of the patient stated to him, that it was " with much difficulty they removed the sword, it was so firmly fixed in the body." Mr. Eoney tliinking deception or misrepresentation was possible, in- quired into, and carefully examined all the circumstances of the case : he found the sword stained with blood from one end to the other; the anterior and posterior wounds in the integuments corresponded, and after the fullest investigation he was convinced of the truth of the original statement. The patient was treated antiphlogistically on prophylactic principles, and strange to relate, recovered in a few days Avithout having had any bad symptoms whatever. Let us now inquire why the contents of the intestines do not always escape when their parietes are completely divided ? Eor a satisfactory explanation of this important fact, the profession are much indebted to Mr. Travers, of London, whose valuable work on " Injuries of the Intes- tines" I strongly recommend you to read. According to this gentleman's experiments and observations, the follow- ing are the chief steps taken by nature to prevent extrava- sation in cases of tliis description.

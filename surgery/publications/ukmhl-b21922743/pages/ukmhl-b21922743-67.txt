LECTURE III. ^ 51 towcords the internal tuberosity of the humerus, where it loses itself in the fibrous structure in the neighbourhood. The upper margin of the bicipital aponeurosis is crescentic m shape and well defined, the convexity being directed upwards, wliilst it is graduaHy lost inferiorly in the fibrous tissues in the neighbourhood. I wiU not trouble you with further remarks on bicipital aponeurosis at present, but hereafter, you wiU learn the important part it performs in modifying the aneurismal tumours which occur in this locaHty. Many of you, are already awaje that the bracliial artery IS usuaHy considered as commencing, both its name and com-se, when it escapes from between the tendons of the latissunus dorsi and teres major muscles posteriorly, and the tendon of the pectoraKs major anteriorly; and that it retams this name until it arrives at about an inch below the elbow-jomt, where it resolves itself into its ulthnate divisions; the radial and ulnar arteries. During its course along the arm, the brachial artery gives off some very im- portant branches, which in a sm-gical, as weU as in an aiiatonucal point of view, it is necessary to bear in mind â€¢ such, formstance, as the superior and inferior profunda' the anastomatica and their numerous branches. The im' portant anastomosis which these vessels maintaha with those oi t^ fore-arm, by means of the recurrent branches, should never be lost sight of by the practical surgeon. Th general descnption, which I have thus briefly given, you are to consider as the ordinary distribution of the uL- m nd that the laws of nature are often uncertain as regards the distnbution of arteries; consequently, the accident

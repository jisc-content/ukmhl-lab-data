LECTURE V. 107 cussion or compression of the brain. Some years since, much importance was attached to the opinions of tliis truly eminent surgeon, and as it may be expected by some of the examiners before whom you shall hereafter appear, that you should know this gentleman's opinions on this subject, i will briefly state them. Mr. Abeenethy divided the symptoms which characterize the worst possible case of concussion consistent with life, into tln*ee stages. "The first is that state of insensibility and derangement of the bodily powers which immediately succeed to the acci- dent. Wliilst it lasts the patient scarcely feels any injury that may be inflicted on him. His breatliing is difficult, but generally without stertor; his pulse intermitting, and his extremities cold. But such a state cannot last long; it goes off gradually, and is succeeded by another, which I consider as the second stage of concussion. In this the pulse and respiration become better, and though not regu- larly performed, are sufficient to maintain hfe, and to diffuse warmth over the extreme parts of the body. The feeling of the patient is now so far restored, that he is sensible if his skin be pinched; but he hes stupid, and inattentive to shght external impressions. As the effects of concussion diminish, he becomes capable of replying to questions put to him in a loud tone of voice, especially when they refer to his cliief suffering at the time, as pain in the head, &c.; otherwise, he answers incoherently, as if his attention could not be excited, or was occupied by sometliing else; he is in short like a man in a heavy sleep. The concussion of the brain, lastly, produces a state of inflammation of the organ, and this constitutes the tldrd stage, wliich is the most important of the series of effects produced from this cause.

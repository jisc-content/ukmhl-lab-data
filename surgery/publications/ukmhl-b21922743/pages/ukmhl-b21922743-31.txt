CHAPTER 11. LECTUEE n. Wounds of arteries and their effects—Structure and pro- perties of arteries—The nat^iral and scientific methods of restraining arterial hemorrhages—Five cases of suicidal wounds of the throat, in one of which the common carotid was successful tied—Practical observations on the cases. Gentlemen^ Tou have lately, had ample opportumties of observ- ing the symptoms, treatment, and termination of some very interesting cases of wounds; more especially those in- flicted by persons who have attempted to commit suicide. To the consideration of these cases I wish to direct your atten- tion to-day, prefacing their discussion with a few general remarks on the structure and properties of arteries, and also, some observations ontheestabhshed doctrines of arterial hemoiThage. On these subjects I wih not detain you long • feehng, as I do, that it is not the province of a clinical lecturer to enter at any length into controversial arguments on anatomical or physiological subjects. By careful dissection the parietes of an artery may be separated into three layers, which are perfectly distinct from each other, not only in their relative situations, but likewise m then- physical and vital properties; and, consequently in the morbid phenomena to wliich they axe liable These layers or coats being naturaUy placed one over the other are usuaUy designated by the words internal, middle, and external. The internal, or hning coat, is dehcate, smooth

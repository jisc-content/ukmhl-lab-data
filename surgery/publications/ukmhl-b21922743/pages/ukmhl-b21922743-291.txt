HYDROPHOUIA. 275 past. I have no object in view beyond calling the atten- tion of the Government, my professional brethren, and the pubKc, to the subject, with a hope that steps will be taken by the proper authorities to get rid of a most dangerous nuisance. To a person, who feels as I do on this subject, it is truly painful to witness the manner in wliich both the streets and squares of Dubhn, are infested with houseless, worthless, hungry, peevish dogs, mixing with cliildren, who innocently fondle and play with them, not knowing that they are in company with a most treacherous and deadly enemy. PINIS.

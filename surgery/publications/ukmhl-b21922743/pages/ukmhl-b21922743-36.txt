20 CLINICAL SURGERY. act precisely in the same manner; for instance, some accom- plisli the desii'ed object by exciting the contraction and re- traction of the vessels; wliilst others prove efficacious by promoting the formation of a coagulum on the surface of the wound. To the first class I would refer cold air, water, spirits of turpentine, diluted acids, solutions of certain as- tringent salts; such as the super-sulphate of alum, acetate of lead; the sulphates of zinc, iron, andj copper. To the second belong certain dry absorbing substances, such as agaric, the pith of rushes, the fur of a hat, cobwebs, &c. &c. I consider that these act merely by absorbing the tliinner parts of the blood, with wliich they combine, and in this way assist the fibrine, or coagulating portion, in form- ing a common clot; by which further effusion is resisted. I need scarcely tell you, that styptics can only j)rove useful when the blood issues from small vessels. The caustics mostfrequently employed, as anti-hemorrhagic remedies, are the nitrate of silver, and sulphate of copper. The latter was much prized some centuries ago by the sur- geons of that time, who being unacquainted with the supe- liority of the hgature, employed it, even in cases of ampu- tation, under the name of "the blue button of vitriol." The instances in wliich caustics of any kind, are had re- course to, at the present day, are exceedingly rare; in fact it is only in those cases, where styptics and pressure have proved ineffectual, and where the ligature cannot be con- veniently apphed. I have myseK found the nitrate of silver very useful in suppressing hemorrhages from wounds of the tongue, and in cases of obstmate bleeding from leech- bites. I may here observe that the practitioner is often annoyed by perplexing hemorrhages of tliis descrijition,

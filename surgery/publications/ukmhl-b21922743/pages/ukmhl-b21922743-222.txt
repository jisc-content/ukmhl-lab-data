206 CLINICAL SURGERY. (juences wliicli result from urinary extravasations into the cellular, and tlie serous tissues. I have already stated, that inflammation and mortification are the usual efl'ects, when they take place in the cellular membrane; now, I wish you to understand, that, in no instance with which I am ac- quainted, did mortification ensue from minary extravasation into the cavity of the peritoneum. Judging from the usual efl'ects of injury and irritation, when apphed to this very dehcate and sensitive membrane, it appears strange, that in cases of ruptured bladder, in which the peritoneum is not only wounded, but brought in contact with a very acrimo- nious fluid, that it should be slow in taking on inflamma- tory action, and capable of resisting its gangrenous conse- quences. In the case of Codd, which ended fatally on the third day after the accident, the usual efl'ects of peritoneal inflammation were but imperfectly marked; and in the case of Corry, the patient lived to the flfteenth day, and the post-mortem appearances would scarcely warrant us in say- ing, that the distressing symptoms, under which he laboured during his illness, were solely the result of peritonitis. The reason why a serous membrane is more capable of resisting the gangrenous effects of inflammation, than cel- lular membrane, is, in my mind, easily explained by a reference to the relative degrees of vitahty which they both possess. Hence it is that the cellular membrane of the scrotum sloughs from a comparatively shght cause.

85 LECTURE IV. womids of the scalp will be modified by their depths and the direction in which they run. Tor example^ let ns suppose a case, in which a wound, three or four inches long extending from before backwards was inflicted, and inquire what symp- toms would be most remarkable ? Hemorrhage would be the most conspicuous symptom in sucli a case, for the fol- lowing reason: the great majority of the blood-vessels of the scalp run in a transverse direction; consequently their habihty to be divided by a longitudinal wound is very great; indeed, a wound four inches long must divide some of them. In the case of a transverse wound of the scalp, the blood-vessels have a better chance of escaping, wlulst its hps will be drawn widely asunder by the antagonising efforts of the occipito-frontaHs muscle. When a surgeon is called to a wound of the scalp, his first duty is to have the hair shaved off for a considerable distance around it: this will facihtate liis future steps in the manage- ment of the case. Sutures and hgatures should be avoided as much as possible, in cases of wounds of the scalp; inas- much as they are calculated to prevent union by the first intention, by exciting erysipelatous inflammation. Should the bleeding happen to be profuse, the inference is, that some important artery has been partially divided. In such a case the surgeon ought, at once complete its division; this being the most expeditious method of putting a stop to the hemorrhage. The effused blood having been removed by a sponge; the lips of the wound should be drawn together, and retamed in contact by sticking plaster, compress and bandage. The constitutional, or general treatment ought to be the same as what I recommended when speaking of bloody tumours. The first dressings should not be removed

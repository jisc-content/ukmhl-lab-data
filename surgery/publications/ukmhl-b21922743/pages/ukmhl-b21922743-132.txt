CLINICAL SURGERY. 116 wise be administered freely^ botli internally and externally, until the system shall be brought fully under its influence. Cold should be constantly appHed to the head, bhsters to the nape of the neck, or between the shoulders; if the case be very bad, the bhstered surfaces may be dressed ^ith mercm'ial ointment. Should tliis plan of treatment prove successful, the length of time which may elapse before the patient recovers, will vary in different cases : if the scalp were not extensively wounded, and the primary miscliief done to the brain was concussion only, he might get perfectly well from the effects of the accident in ten or twelve days, but it will take another week at least, before he can recover from the debili- tating effects of the treatment. If the scalp were exten- sively wounded, and that in addition to concussion, the brain suffered from the presence of extravasated blood, the recovery must be very slow, and perhaps will never be com- plete. Much time wiU be necessary for the healing of the wound, and absorption of the effused blood. Wlien I say that the recovery may be incomplete, what I mean is, that all danger to Hfe may have passed away and the patient feel, or appear as well, or nearly so, as he was previous to the accident; yet, some defects remain, such as imperfect memory, or loss of one or more of the senses: he may recover.with partial paralysis of the muscles of one side of the face, or of a leg, or arm. The inflammations of the brain and its membranes, wliich result from injuries of the head, may, I think, be fairly divided into two species, wliich I wovdd designate by the relative terms of immediate or primari/ ; and the remote or secondary. By the immediate, or primary, I mean that form

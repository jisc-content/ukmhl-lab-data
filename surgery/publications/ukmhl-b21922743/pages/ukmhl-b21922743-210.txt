CLINICAL SURGEllY. 194 case the patient was able to walk to, and from the hospital soon after the accident occurred; and that it was not until some hours afterwards, he was attacked with bad symptoms; whereas, in the case of Lawless, violent symptoms were es- tabhshed the moment the wound was inflicted, and conti- nued without intermission until he died. In reference to this point I wish to observe, that it is a fact very generally admitted, that the degree of shock imparted to the consti- tution in consequence of injuries of the abdomen, is in the direct ratio of their relation to the solar plexus; that is to say, the nearer the injury is, to that important and \dtal part, the more deeply will the constitution sympatliise at the moment of the accident, and the greater the danger to be apprehended, as to the ultimate termination of the case. If you acquiesce in tlie correctness of this doctrine, you can easily comprehend why Lawless, who was wounded in the stomach, got no quarter from the moment of the acci- dent, whilst Donohoe, whose coecum was ruptured, did not suffer from bad symptoms for some hours after the infliction of the injury, when peritoneal inflammation set in and be- came the immediate cause of death. I wiH now read a case which tends to support the vahdity of the opinion I have already expressed, as regards the uifluence Avhich the relation of the solar plexus to the local mischief may have, in a case of nbdominal injury.

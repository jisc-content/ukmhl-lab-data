90 CLINICAL SURGERY. in tliis case is not caused^ merely by the distended state of the vessels, and an effusion of serum; for you have likewise a deposition of lymph in the sub-cutaneous cellular mem- brane. In the event of tliis case proceeding from bad to worse, the following changes will take place in the symp- toms :—^the sweUiug will become softer, and the pain con- siderably diminished in the part which was first attacked; but the disease may continue to extend itself into the sur- rounding stractures, wliich were not originally engaged. These symptoms plainly indicate that suppuration, and probably mortification, have taken place in the sub-cutaneous cellular tissue. If this case be left to natui-e, in the course of time the skin wiU become perforated by ulcerative ab- sorption, and the morbid products beneath, consisting of pus and dead cellular membrane, permitted to escape. It occasionally happens that the sweUing is caused almost en- tirely, by the effusion of serum into the sub-cutaneous cellular membrane; in this case, the skin is not much engaged, tlie affected part is soft and oedematous, and the pain trifling. I have now described four varieties of the disease, all of which admit of an easy explanation, and might be fairly designated by the following terms.—The first I would call the smple cutaneous erysipelas; the second, the vesicular; the tliird, the phlegmonoid, and the foui-th the (edematous. This classification does not materially differ from the one given by Mr. Lawrence of London, whose opinions and ob- servations on this subject deserve your attention. That the constitutional symptoms attendant upon the different forms of the disease should vary considerably, is only what might reasonably be expected. Having premised these general observations, with a view of giving the junior portion of

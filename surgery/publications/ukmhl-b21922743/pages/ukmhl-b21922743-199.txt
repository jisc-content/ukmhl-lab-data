LECTURE VIII. 183 of countenance, coldness of the skin, and feeble pulse, together with an unnatural degree of fdness in the neigh- bourhood of the injury, quickly followed the infliction of the wound, there could be Httle doubt that extravasation of blood to a considerable amount had taken place. What should the surgeon do in such an embarrassing case as tliis ? The practice recommended the present day, is to open a vein in the arm at once, with a view to produce syncope as speedQy as possible, and in this way interrupt the bleeding, and afl'ord time for the coagulation of the blood already efi"used. The patient should be kept perfectly quiet and cool, and closely watched, lest in the event of reaction taking place, it might be necessary to have re- course to the lancet a second, or even a third time. Should a recovery be effected in a case of tliis description, the fol- lowing pathological phenomena must have occurred in the neighbourhood of the wound. The effused blood having first coagulated, afforded a sort of barrier, which was suffi- cient, under the circumstances, to resist the feeble impulse of the heart's action, and in this way arrest the bleeding in the first instance : in the course of a few hours inflamma- tion set in, and the consequent effusion of lymph, at the mouths of the wounded vessels, superseded the further ne- cessity of the blood remaining any longer; accordingly, the absorbents began to affect its removal, whilst the wounded vessels were being closed up by the adhesive inflammation. I have been thus particular in detailing the various changes, which take place during the curative process, in order to show you the erroneous nature of the practice adopted by the old surgeons, in such cases as I have been describing. They recommended in all cases of internal

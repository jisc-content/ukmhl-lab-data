18 CLINICAL SURGERY. between the aperture in tlie artery and tliat in the sheath is completely clone away with; the blood coagulates, and pre- sents a sort of temporary compress or baiTier against further extravasation. In the course of a few hours uiflanunation becomes established in the lips of the wound, the arterice arteriarum pour out lymph, which quickly becomes organ- ized ; the adhesive process, finally, seals up the wound; and there being no further use for the clot of blood, the absorbents effect its removal. Such are the salutary changes accompHshed by natm-e, provided the wound of the artery do not engage more than one-fo2irth of its caHber. Let us now suppose a case iu wliich the vessel has been completely divided, and inquire what steps nature wQl take in that instance, with a view to accompHsh a cure independently of the interposition of art ? In a case of this descrij)tion, the cut extremities of the artery contract as to their diameter, and retract witliin the sheath at the moment the division takes place; the gush of blood, which must be considerable, is quickly followed by the fainting of the patient; a languid state of the circulation is, of course, the immediate conse- quence. Accordingly, a coagulum forms between the re- tracted extremities of the wounded artery; so that all that portion of the sheath which was left empty by their retrac- tion is now filled up by coagulated blood. Coagula also form witliin the extremities of the divided arter}^, extending from the mouth, or mouths to the next anastomosing branches. In a short time inflammation wiU set in, as iu the former case, and lymph will be shed by the small vessels of the wounded artery, wliich will constitute a sort of boundary, or line of demarcation between the internal and external coagula. The next stage consists in the organization of tliis

SUICIDAL WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. 45 which it is rational to suppose was in part iadnced by the impression such a wound made on the nervous system generally^ but priacipally by the loss of bloody which must have been considerable, although the trunks of the carotids themselves happened to escape.

In the case of Lord C , the unfortunate suicide showed, plainly, that he was acquainted with the anatomy of the parts he wounded. Here, there was no complication, no communication whatever established with the air passa- ges. No; it was an awful but simple wound of a great vessel, and the patient died of hemorrhage in a few seconds after its infliction. The question naturally arises, could nothing have been done to stem the dreadful torrent before the vital spark had fled ? Tliis is a question which I feel some dehcacy in replying to, lest I might attribute unmerited blame to the medical gentleman who had been in atten- dance ; and, whose conduct on the occasion may have been misrepresented. If on the contrary, he so far lost his pre- sence of mind as to stand " motionless," in a case where the fate of the patient could only have been averted by promptness of action, it must be admitted that neither surgery, nor the patient had fair play.

The causes, progress, duration, and the pathological phe- nomena, attendant on nervous diseases, are so variable, and so imperfectly understood, that it is impossible to lay down any one plan of treatment wliich wiU apply to all cases. In our prescriptions we should be guided by the circumstances pecuHar to each individual case. In accordance with this IDrinciple the remedies employed in the case of Mrs. Pinn were numerous and varied as cu'cumstances seemed to indi- cate. Eor example, when the paroxysms were ^dolent and the countenance was suffused, leeches were occasionaUy ap- phed either to the temples, spme, labia, oringumal regions. Embrocations to the temples, and bhsters to the nape of the neck, spine, and epigastrium, were also employed from time to time. IiiternaUy she got purgatives, antispasmochcs, tonics, and emmenagogues of every description. In concludmg this protracted but interesting discussion, permit me to state, although I am vain enough to tliink that the plan of treatment adopted in this case had a bene- ficial influence in moderating the symptoms, that I ought not confidently attribute the present improvement either to the skiU of the medical attendant or the specific efficacy of his prescriptions.

WOUNDS OF THE STOMACH. 195 passed over her body; she was carried to the hospital in about an hour afterwards. On admission, she was exceed- ingly weak and exhausted; the countenance pale and the eyes sunken; the pulse weak and almost imperceptible; she seemed unwilling to answer questions; was extremely rest- less, constantly tossing her limbs about in the bed j she drank greedily and had frequent retclung; but nothing came up from the stomach; there was no tenderness of the abdo- men. She gradually became more and more exhausted, and expired in four hours after her admission into the hos- pital. Aidopsy.—On examination twelve hours after death, the peritoneum presented a healthy appearance; but a few cherry-stones, mixed with alimentary matter, were found in its cavity. When these substances were removed, a small rent was discovered in the descending portion of the duo- denum, tlirough which they had escaped. The lower ex- tremity of the spleen was also ruptured; there was, how- ever, very httle blood effused; aU the other viscera were perfectly natural. Remarks.—You will observe that this was a case in which the injury was situated quite in the neighbourhood of the solar plexus, and that the patient never reco- vered from the first shock of the accident; the immediate cause of death cannot, therefore, be faii'ly attributed either to loss of blood, or peritoneal inflammation. The next cases for consideration are those of ruptured bladder, but before we discuss them individually, I feel that a few observations on the subject of urinary extrava- sations in general, would not be misapphed, and that they may be instructive to the junior part of my hearers.

CLINICAL SURGERY. 72 wound was perfectly healed^ the tumour had nearly disap- peared, and the pulse at the wrist was as well developed as in the arm of the opposite side. Gentlemen, we have now arrived at the consideration of the best method of treating the arterio-venous or varicose aneurism. It is a weU estabhshed rule in surgery that we should never operate in a case of this kind unless when compelled to do so by urgent cii-cumstances. For example, suppose pressure had been fairly tried without advantage, that the tumour is increasing in size, that it is painfal and the hmb swollen; when this state of things is estabhshed, the necessity for surgical interference is but too obvious. The operation wliich promises most advantage under such circumstances is that of tying the artery above the aneurismal tumour, as in the case I have just men- tioned; leaving the tumour itself to the action of the absorbents. Judging from the hterature of this subject, the operation should be undertaken with the utmost caution and circumspection, inasmuch as the records of surgery fur- nish but few cases in which it was not followed by unto- ward consequences. I have myself witnessed but one case of this form of aneurism, in which the artery was tied. The case I allude to was treated by the late Mr. Hewson in the Meath Hospital. Tor some days after the operation the case appeared unpromising, the tumom- ha^^ng retained its former size and pulsation. On the tliii-d day after tiie operation Mr. Hewson appHed a compress of lint over the tumour, and retained it in this position by strips of adlie- sive plaster, wliich were drawn obhquely over it; but in such a manner as not to completely encircle the limb, so as to impede the retui-n of venous blood.

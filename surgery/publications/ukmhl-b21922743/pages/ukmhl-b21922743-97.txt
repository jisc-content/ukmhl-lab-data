LECTURE IV. 81 sists of tliree elementary portions, which become manifest on allowing it to remain at rest for some minutes after it has been drawn from a vein: I allude to the fibrine, serum, and red globules; now, you should bear in mind that the power of self-coagulation, with which the blood is endowed, belongs exclusively to the fibrine. This being the case, it follows, as a matter of course, that the amount and perfection of the coagulum must, in aU cases of extra- vasation, be determined by the relative portion of fibrine which exists in any given quantity of blood. The blood of the human foetus contains httle or no fibrine; during in- fancy and cliildhood, the quantity is comparatively small, and it is only in full-grown persons of good constitution, that the fibrine exists in its perfect state : you must not, therefore, expect to find it, except in a comparatively small quantity in old age, and in persons of a dehcate constitu- tion. Such being the case, you should not be surprised if you find a bloody tumour on the head of a cliild, extensive and soft; and one from a similar cause, in a healthy young man, circumscribed and firm; whilst in a person of lax fibre and delicate constitution, it will probably possess the mixed characters I have already described, when speaking of tlie third form of this affection. Tliis last species of bloody tumour is hable to be mistaken for a depressed fracture of the skuU; the more especially, if it should be attended with such general symptoms as indicate injury of the brain. The symptoms wliich a bloody tumour may have in common with a depressed fracture, are, the yielchng spot in the centre of the tumour, whilst it is curcumscribed by a firm margin. In order to asceri;ain, as far as possible, the precise nature of a doubtful case, the surgeon should pass his finaer for some E 2 J. ^ .

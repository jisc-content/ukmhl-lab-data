/)0 CLINICAL SURGERY, situated about an incli, or an incli and a half above the elbow-jomt in an aduh. The second passes upwards and inwards to join the basilic at about the same distance above the joint; whilst the tldixl sinks beneath the fascia to join the deep-seated vems of the hmb below the elbow-joint. By looking closely to the median cephalic and median basilic Veins, it will be seen that they are accompanied by a number of small nerves. The perforans Casseri, or external cutaneous becomes superficial immediately above and external to the elbow-joint; where it emerges from between the external margin of the biceps, and the mternal edge of the supmator radu longus muscles. The internal cutaneous nerve usually becomes superficial by penetratmg the fascia in the middle- third of the arm; very often passing out tln-ough the same opening with the basilic vein; the latter being on its way to join the deep-seated veins. I will not detain you with a minute description of these nerves; on beconung superficial they mdividually resolve themselves into a number of small branches which proceed in company with the superficial vems, towards the hand, gradually expending themselves by sending twigs to these vessels, and to the integuments in the neighbourhood. Gentlemen, I now wish to call your attention to the nature of the fascia of the fore-arm; many of you are already aware that it is tolerably strong and mmelding; liere, I wish to remind you that its strength is considerably nicreased anteriorly, immediately below the elbow-jomt, by a fibrous or aponeuretic expansion derived from the uhiar, or internal margin of the tendon of the biceps muscle; this important accession to the fascia of the fore-arm takes an oblique dhection from below upwards and inwards

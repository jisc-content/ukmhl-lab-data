59 LECTURE III. ill the anem-ismal sac must be of a mixed character, being principally suppHed by the artery, wliilst the vein also, con- tributes its quota. From a consideration of these anatomi- cal and pathological facts, you must at once perceive tha,t pressure apphed to the artery above the tumour, although it may destroy its pulsation, for the time being, will not neces- sarily alter its size to any great extent, inasmuch as the vein will continue to pour in its supply of blood. When an aneurism of this description has lasted for some time, the superficial veins of the fore-arm become both enlarged and tortuous, from the wrist to some distance above the tumour j hence it is, that Dr. W. Hunter, who it is generally admit- ted, was the first person to call the attention of the profes- sion to this form of disease, gave it the name of " varicose aneurismyou will find Dr. Hunter's description of this affection in the volumes of the Medical Observations and Inquiries, pubhshed in the years 1757, and 1764. After what I have now stated, I do not think it necessary to occupy your time at any length with a description of the aneurismal varix of authors, which, in ahnost every respect, bears a sti-ong sumHtude to the arterio-venous, or varicose aneurism, which we have just disposed of. The only diffe- rence between these two affections is, that in the latter, the artery^ and vein communicate by means of an intervening aneurismal sac; whereas, in the aneurismal varix, there is a direct communication between the artery and vein, whicli have been incorporated with each other at the seat of the injury by the adhesive inflammation, in such a manner that the openings in the artery and vein are converted into one of reciprocal communication between these vessels. Such being the case, and the blood circulating through the artery

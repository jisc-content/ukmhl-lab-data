In reply to this argument, I wish to remind you, that in many of the cases, which I mentioned at our last meeting, and which were not attended with fracture of the bone, where the operation was performed many days after the accident, and with the expectation of finding matter between the dura- mater and the skuU; the former was found healthj, but in a few days after, became inflamed and sloughy.

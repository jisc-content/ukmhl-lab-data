CHAPTER III. LECTURE III. Traumatic aneurisms and their varieties.—The surgical anatomy of the lend of the arm.—The diffused and cir- cumscribed false aneurisms.—Varicose aneurism, and aneu- rismal varix.—Temporal aneurisms.—The symptoms, pa- thology, and treatment of all, illustrated hj cases. Gentlemen^ I wish to direct your attention this morning to the subject of tranmatic aneurisms, the varieties of them which you may expect to meet in practice, and should, when called on, be prepared to treat, on scientific pmciples. Tliere is not, perhaps, a single artery of hnportance in the human body wliich may not be the seat of traumatic aneurism, masmuch as they are all hable to be wounded; however, m civil hfe it is most frequently met with in connexion with the brachial and temporal arteries, and is m almost every instance, produced by the operation of blood-lettmg. As 1 recognise amongst you, many juniors, whom I am to con- sider not well acquainted with the anatomical relations of these vessels, and as it is my wish, as weU as my duty, to make myself inteUigible to all my hearers-, I hope the seiuor portion of the class will bear with me, wliilst I make a few observations on the relative anatomy of the parts situated at the bend of the arm and its vicinity.

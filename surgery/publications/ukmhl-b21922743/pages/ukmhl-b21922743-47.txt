31 SUICIDAL WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. It wotild have been very desirable, were it practicable, to have tied the wounded artery ia the first instance j but having failed in my efforts to accomphsh that object, I had recoui-se to an irritating styptic and compression. I select- ed the turpentine, hoping that, by its stimulating properties, it would excite a sufficient degree of ioflammation to seal up the wound in the bleeding vessel by the process of adhesion; but in this calculation I was unfortunately dis- appointed. It is somewhat remarkable that the bleeding did not occur when the patient himself removed the com- press and bandage on the third day after the infliction of the wound; and that it should take place at so remote a- period as the sixth, when no exciting cause whatever existed. You may now natm'ally inquire why was not the external rather than the common carotid tied in the present instance? In reply I beg to state, that in my opinion, it was both an easier and safer operation to tie the cormnon than the external carotid. Tor instance, if the latter were tied, the hgature should be apphed heloio the origin of the fascial or labial artery, otherwise this would bring the operator down to the lower thh'd of the external carotid, where it is crossed by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and the ninth pair of nerves. Well, then, let us for a moment suppose, that these parts have been properly disposed of, the thyroid and lingual arteries, which arise from tliis part of the vessel, come into view, so that the ligature must be appHed either close to the origin of the external carotid itself, or close (o these vessels. Under these circumstances, you must per- ceive, that a coagulum could not be fonned; the adhesive process would, necessarily, be interrupted by the circulation

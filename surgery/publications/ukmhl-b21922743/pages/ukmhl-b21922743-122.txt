"When blood, which may be considered a natural inhabi- tant, although not a fixed resident of the cranium, is capa- ble of producing, and modifying symptoms in parts situated at a distance; you must expect results of a very variable character from the different forms of accident and disease to which the brain is liable : hence, the great difficulty of arriving at a satisfactory conclusion as to the precise nature of the case, by reasoning from symptoms only. I will not delay you longer with prefatory observations, but proceed by asking what are the bad efi'ects which may be produced in the brain by external violence ? They are three in num- ber, viz.â€”concussion, compression, and injiammatmi. By concussion of the brain is meant a shake, or shock wliich may partially or completely, for a time, or forever destroy its functions, without necessarily producing any visible lesion of structure. It is quite obvious, then, that the symptoms of concussion must vary in degree of severity, in number, and in duration in different cases, from a sHght momentary shock, to the complete extinction of life. Sometimes they will resemble those of syncope; there being loss of sense, speech, and voluntary motion, attended with pahdity of countenance and cold extremities; whilst iu other instances apoplectic symptoms will be present: the state of the pulse, respiration, and pupils AviU vary ia different cases. The late Mr. Abernethy undertook to classify the smp- toms of concussion : he imagined that he could tell from the symptoms only, whether a patient was affected with con-

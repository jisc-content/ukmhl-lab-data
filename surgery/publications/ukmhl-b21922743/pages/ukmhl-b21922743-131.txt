In taking away blood in such a case you are to be guided by the effect produced on the pulse.

The arm having been bound up, you may now order a cathartic bolus, composed of calomel and jalap; which should be placed on the dorsum of the tongue. Patients whose powers of deglutition are much impaired, can swallow a bolus much better than liquid medicine, or pills. The operation of the bolus may be assisted by a terebinthinate enema, administered in a couple of hours afterwards.

The case should, henceforward, be treated as one of inflam- mation of the brain, by bleeding, both locally and gene- rally, from time to tune, according to the symptoms and strength of the patient's constitution.

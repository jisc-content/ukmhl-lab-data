171 lECTURE Vll. the proposal is often received with, doubt by the parties most interested. The patient himself feels weak, and his friends, judging partly from his representations, and partly from the pale sunlcen state of the countenance, become sceptical as regards the skill of the medical attendant. However, you should not be dissuaded from doing what you beheve the state of the case demands, by any foolish remonstrance on the part of the patient, or his friends; if they show an unwillingness to allow you to act according to your judg-ment, insist on a consultation, and if this should be refused, retire from the attendance altogether, and leave the responsibility of the case in other hands. If you should be allowed to act on yom- own judgment, why the sooner you bleed the patient the better. Make a large oiifice in the vein, so as to take away the blood in a fuU stream; by this mode of proceeding there will be a much better chance of causing fainting, than if it came away slowly. The effect of the bleeding on the pulse is very remarkable: you wiU often find it becommg soft and expanded, wliilst the blood is flowing. This you are to consider as a change for the better, which impHes that the circulating system is being reHeved from the oppressed condition under which it suf- fered. The bleeding sliould be continued until a serious impression is made on the patient; although it is by no means easy, in such a case, to produce absolute fainting; stm symptoms approacliing to that state mO. occiu-; such as languor of the eyes, yawning, cold perspiration on the face, and slow respiration, with occasional deep sighs. The pam ]s usually suspended during this state of things; and if the case shall end favoiu-ably, the probabihty is, that it ^all never retiu:n with the same degree of acutene^ss which previously existed.

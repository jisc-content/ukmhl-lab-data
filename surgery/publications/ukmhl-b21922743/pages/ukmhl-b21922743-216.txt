200 CLINICAL SURGElty, having become firmly impacted in it, when on its way from the bladder. The breach in the canal is sometimes effected by ruptm-e, in consequence of the great straining, resulting from the desire to pass water, M'hich is mechanically resisted by the foreign body; at other times the mucous membrane of the urethra may be removed by ulcerative absorption, which may take place without being preceded by the ad- hesive inflammation. My present object, however, is to apprise you of the fact, that the urine of cluldi-en, being cliiefly composed of water, does not, when extravasated, so speedily produce the same destructive consequences to the cellular membrane through which it is diffused, as in the cases of adults and old men. Wlien apprising you of tliis pathological fact, I do not wish to convey the idea that you should be less vigilant or attentive in the treatment, on that account; on the contrary, the cause of the extravasation (the calculus) should be removed as quickly as possible by a fi'ee incision made through the distended parts, in order to afford the effused urine an opportunity to oo&e out of the cellular tissue with wliich it has commingled. I have pro- nou.nced the word " ooze" emphatically; for, you must not expect that a sudden gush of urine will take place, when an incision is made into the part affected; this never occm-s unless the extravasated fluid, should happen to be confined in a circumscribed cavity, wliich does not often take place. After the incision, a poultice should be appHed; it will not be necessary to introduce a catheter in the case of a child ; and, indeed, it is a very fortunate circumstance that it can be dispensed with; for, even if it were absolutely necessary, it would not be possible to retain it quietly in the bladder. The observations which I have made, refer merely to such

lECTURE VI. 137 inasmuch as we are, by the peculiar locality of the parts engaged, altogether precluded from ascertaining the state of the bone, either by manual or ocular examination. Extravasations of blood within the cranium may be pro- duced by external violence, in any one of the following situations, viz.â€”^between the bone and dura-mater, between the pia-mater and the cerebral portion of the arachnoid membrane; between the pia-mater and the surface of the brain, in the substance of the brain, in the ventricles, or into the cavity of the arachnoid membrane. This last form of extravasation is usually the result of a fracture of the skull attended with a laceration of the dura-mater; including, of course, its arachnoidal layer. Some writers tell you that blood may be effused between the dura-mater and the arachnoid; this is a great mistake, and quite incompatible with the intimate union wliich exists between these two membranes, which nearly amounts to an incorporation of dissimilar structures. A few years ago I saw a case which was treated by my distinguished friend, and late colleague Dr. KiRBY, in this hospital, in which the extravasated blood was found in a fluid state in all the situations I have mentioned. Let us now inquire how blood when extravasated within the skull, proves injm-ious, and if death be caused in such a case, by the actual loss sustained by the vascular system ? No ! impossible, there is not space enough witlain the skull to accommodate an extravasation sufficiently copious to pro- duce death on that piinciple. It is then, either by causing compression of the brain so as to destroy its functions, or by acting as a foreign body, when extravasated, and as such, exciting inflammation, that it can be productive of fatal

HYDROPHOBIA. 273 tliis case in tlie newspaper at the time it occuiTed, but I learned the pai-ticulars from a brother of the deceased this day. There is a case of hydrophobia published in the London Medical and Surgical Journal^ for the year 1835^ which was reported by Dr. Byene, as having been treated in the West- minster Hospital by liimself.

I have now briefly described the leading points relative to eight cases of hydrophobia caused by the bites of dogs, and there is no evidence whatever to prove, that in a single instance, the dog was rabid; on the contrary, we have incontrovert- ible proofs both of a positive, and negative character, which must lead the unprejudiced reader to form an opposite opinion. These cases ought, in my mind, be deemed suffi- cient to convince the greatest sceptic, that the bite of a dog, wliich is not rabid, can produce hydrophobia in the human species! The next question for consideration, is,â€”can a dog in perfect health, in a state of tranquillity, and when it does not bite or attempt to bite, produce hydrophobia in the human subject ? I beheve it can, and in support of this opinion, I will now relate a few well authenticated cases. The late surgeon T. Eoney mentioned to me the case of a young gentleman who had a small ulcer on the skin, for the cure of which, he was recommended by a non-medi- cal acquaintance to get a dog to Hck it. He accordingly got

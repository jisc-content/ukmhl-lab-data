177 LECTURE VII. Let us now inquire what are tlie bad consequences to be apprehended from a wounding instrument having entered what is usually called the " cavity" of the abdomen, with- out injmiug either the viscera or any important blood vessel. Here, I wish you to bear in mind, that the term " cavity," as apphed by anatomists to the natural state of the head, thorax, and abdomen, is not, in the ordinary ac- ceptation of the word, critically correct, inasmuch as the containing, and the parts contained, bear a strict proportion to each other; consequently, there can be no_ vacuum in the hving body. Hence it is, that we frequently find wounds in these regions, giving rise to visceral protrusions such as hernia cerebri, hernia pulmonalis, hernia intes- tinahs, &c., &c. In the case of the abdomen, the relation wliich exists between its walls and contents is not of a pas- sive nature; on the contrary, during respiration the floating viscera must be kept in a state of constant motion, by the alternate action of the abdominal and levatores ani muscles, on the one hand, and the diaphragm on the other. Such being the case, we can readily understand ^vhy it is that penetrating wounds are usually complicated with protrusions of the omentum and intestines; the natural lubricity of their serous surfaces supphes an additional explanation of this well known fact. Let us now suppose a case in which a penetrating wound of the abdomen has been inflicted, and that portions of in- testine and mesentery protrude, and inquire what the surgeon ought to do when called on ? He should, in the first instance, ascertain by a careful examination whether the protruded intestine had been wounded or not, and when satisfied in the negative, he should at once proceed I 2

lECTURE II. 21 when leeclies have been apphed to cliildren. I recollect ha\dng heard on more than one occasion, a distinguished lecturer in this city, call the attention of his class in a very forcible manner to tliis " strange fact, which he would not pretend to explain." The fact in question, however, does not aj)pear to me to be so opposed to the well-known laws of the animal economy as to draw forth such a declaration from the learned professor. When we call to mind the high degree of vascularity the skin of the child naturally pos- sesses ; the rapidity of the circulation; the small quantity of fibrine wliich exists in the blood at this period of life; and the utility of a clot in stopping hemorrhages, the " strange fact" becomes deprived of the alleged obscurity, and is rendered intelligible to all medical men of moderate attainments and ordinary understanding. The caustic differs in its mode of action fi'om the styptic, inasmuch as it not only stimulates the vessels to contraction but likewise produces a slough or eschar, which acts as a plug to the open extremity of the wounded artery. However, should it unfortunately so happen that this temporary barrier becomes displaced before the adliesive uoflammation has permanently closed the wound, the bleeding must ine\dtably recur. Under these circumstances, you must at once per- ceive that caustic is a very uncertain means of suppressing hemorrhage. The actual cautery was formerly a favourite with surgeons as an anti-liemorrhagic remedy, but it is now employed only in those cases where styptics and caustics have proved in- effectual, and neither pressure nor ligature can be apphed with advantage; such, for instance, as after the removal of fungous growths from the antrum, vascular tumours from

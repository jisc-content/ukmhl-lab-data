The history of this case makes it easy of compre- hension : the symptoms which were produced by the blow in the first instance; were the effects of concussion; which gradually passed off, but at the time the blow was given^ it ruptured a small blood-vessel^ within the skull, wliich did not actively pour out its contents at the time; the shock of the accident, having had the effect of enfeebling the power of the heart; but when it had passed away, and the circu- lation of the blood was restored to its former condition, the ruptured vessel bled freely, and the extravasated blood, by its gradual accumulation, produced compression of the braui.

The brain may suffer from concussion, although no vio- lence whatever were directly appHed to the head: I have known a man to shp from the top of a stack of corn, and rapidly come to the ground on his feet, but so great was the shock transmitted to the bram, that he instantly fell down, and remained for some time on his back in a state of msensibility.

CHAPTER YL LECTURE YI. Compression of the brain.—Its Causes, viz.—Fractures.— Extravasations of Blood.—Foreign Bodies.—Pus.—The me, and abuse of the Trephine.— General p-ecepts.—Hernia Cerebri.—Cases and observations. Gentlemen, At oux last meeting we were engaged in discussing, in a general way, concussion, inflammation, and compression of the brain, as the usual effects of violence apphed either directly to the head itself, or to some distant part; I now request your attention to the special consideration of the causes and treatment of compression. The brain may be compressed either by a fractured bone, foreign bodies, ex- travasated blood, pus, or serum. It is the duty of the sur- geon to make liimself well acquainted with these causes, in order that he may be able to remove them, when at all practicable. There is no part of the skull which may not be fractured; we accordingly, meet with a great variety of fractui-es, as regards situation; hence it is, that we are in the habit of speaking of fractm-es of the roof, the base, the back, and anterior parts of the cranium. The bone maybe either simply broken without being displaced, or a portion of it may be driven in, so as to press upon the brain and its membranes: tiiis has given rise to the di\dsion of fi-actures into those with, and, those without depression. Eractures of the skull may, like those of tiie extremities, be fairly

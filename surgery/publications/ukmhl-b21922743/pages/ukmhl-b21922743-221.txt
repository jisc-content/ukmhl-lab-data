KUPTURE OF THE BIADDER. 20^1 Observations.â€”I have now read for you. Gentlemen, two very interesting cases of ruptured bladder, together with a description of the appearances exhibited by the 2^ost- mortem examinations; and now, before we separate, I wish to make a few general observations regarding these cases. In the first place^ it may, perhaps, appear somewhat strange to you, that the bladder should have given way, in both instances, in that part which is covered by peritoneum. Now, you are not to consider this in the hght of an acci- dental circumstance; in every case I am acquainted with, in which the bladder gave way, in consequence of falls or blows on the abdomen, the rupture took place in the peri- toneal region of the organ. In support of this statement, I beg to refer you, to two very important cases of tliis de- scription, which have been pubHshed in the second volume of the " Dublin Hospital Reports," by Dr. Ctjsack ; and also, to the ninth volume of the "Dublin Journal of Medi- cal Science" in which you wiU find the particulars of some iateresting cases, detailed by my distinguished colleague. Dr. Hahuison. The only explanation I would venture to suggest, is the anatomical fact, that the superior and pos- terior regions are weaker than the other parts of the bladder; inasmuch as, they do not receive any support from the reflections of the pelvic fasciae, whilst the peritoneal cover- ing, which is comparatively thin and dehcate, and being, in common with all serous membranes devoid of elasticity, is therefore, incapable of accommodating itself to violence suddenly apphed, and yields only by the laceration of its proper structure. The next point to wliich I am anxious to call your atten- tion, is the difference wliich exists between the local conse-

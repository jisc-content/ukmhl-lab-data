39 SUICIDAL WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. frightful a gash, beiug fully tlu-ee inches in every diameter, and apparently sufficiently large to admit the shut fist. At the upper portion you could perceive the inferior part of the pharjTix drawn up to a level with the chin, quite pendulous, having anterior to it the cut portions the thyroid cartilages wliich were wliite and shining. In the centre the outhne of some of the bodies of the cervical vertebree could be distinguished. At the lower portion the trachea was drawn to a level with the top bone of the sternum, wliich was moved up and down at each respiration, and constantly emittuig a large quantity of bloody frothy mucus thi-ougli a cii-cular opening, about three quarters of an inch in diameter during expiration, producing efforts at cougliing. The sides of the wound were bounded by the anterior edges of the stemo-cleido-mastoid muscles, underneath which the carotids could be felt beating in theii- relative situations. All hemor- rhage had ceased, and, therefore, no vessel had to be secured. With difficulty, and at a considerable depth, at the lower portion of the wound (assisted by Mr. Elhs) I succeeded in laying hold of the cesophagus, with a forceps, in order to pass a gum-elastic tube from the mouth into the stomach, but as its presence there seemed to cause uneasiness and distress, shortly afterwards it was removed."' Dr. Jameson in a subsequent part of his report informs us that the unfortunate woman died of exliaustion in about tlurty-four hours after the infliction of the wound; and con- cludes with an interesting account of the appearances pre- sented at the post mortem examination; however, my present object bemg to practically dlustrate principles by reference to cases, I hope I shaU be pardoned for not quoting the very judicious observations made by the learned gentlemaii on the case, m a medico-legal point of view.

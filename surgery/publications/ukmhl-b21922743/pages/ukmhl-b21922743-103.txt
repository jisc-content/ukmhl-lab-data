87 LECTURE IV. dressing and astringent lotions. Whilst the local treatment I have just mentioned, is being put in force, the state of the constitution must not be lost sight of. The antiplilogistic treatment should be put in force from the commencement^ and rigidly persevered in until all inflammatory symptoms shall have passed away. At this period^ a generous diet may be allowed, and tonics administered with advantage. It was formerly the practice in case of flap-wounds of the scalp, attended with laceration and contusion, to dress them for some days after their infliction, by introducing pieces of lint or "'holland'''' spread on hotli sides, with simple ointment, between the flap and the surface from which it had been detached. This dressing was renewed daily, and continued until all sloughs and foreign bodies had come away, and granulations became estabUshed, both on the sur- face of the flap, and that of the pericranium. These two gran- ular surfaces were now allowed to come in contact j the dress- ings being applied externally, until the cure was completed. The objections to this method of treatment are tln-ee-fold. In the first place, by the introduction of the dressing into the wound, the patient was deprived of the chance of union by the fii'st intention in any part of it; secondly, by keeping the flap apart it contracted, and became unnaturally thick; and consequently, did not accurately fit the surface from which it had been detached; and thirdly, the cure was rendered more tedious than it ought to be, and was attend- ed with permanent deformity. Injuries of the scalp so often become comphcated by an attack of erysipelas that I feel I cannot advantageously proceed with their further consideration, until I shaU have made some general obser- vations on this disease.

117 LECTURE V. of inflammation which becomes estabhshed in forty-eight hours after the accidentj and may terminate fatally in a few days; this species of inflammation usually commences in the pia-mater or arachnoid membrane^ and ultimately ex- tends to the brain itself: the dura-mater will not necessarily become impHcated^ provided it were not lacerated or other- wise injured at the tune of the accident. The symptoms which indicate a toell-marked case of this kindj are such as you might reasonably expect, when you take into account the exquisite dehcacy of the parts engaged, and the impor- tant functions performed by the brain, when in a healthy or natural state. The patient is restless and dehrious, with suffusion of the eyes and intolerance of Hght: the skin is hot and dry, the tongue furred, the bowels confined, the respuration hurried, and the pulse usually quick and hard; however, the state of the pulse in cases of inflammation of the brain is by no means uniformly the same; and, it should not be considered as an imerruag guide in the treatment, as it is, in many iastances of severe ioflanunatory affections situated elsewhere. Should this case proceed, to a fatal termmation, the symptoms become rapidly worse, the patient can't be kept in bed, and the fever increases in degree of sever- ity. At length this state is succeeded by exliaustion and coma; the patient now lies in bed unconscious of surrounding objects; involuntary discharges may take place; the pulse becomes small and intermitting, the breatlnng stertorous, the extremities cold, and finally he dies comatose, or a con- vulsive fit may close the scene. The post-mortem appear- ances win not materially differ from those I have described at our last meetmg, when speaking of erysipelas of the head, provided the case was not comphcated with extrava-

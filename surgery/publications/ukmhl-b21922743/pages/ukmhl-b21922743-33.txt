Tliis being the case, it follows as a natural consequence, tliat arteries, in common â– with. aU parts endowed with vitality, are susceptible of dis- ease ; although capable in many instances, by their power of self-preservation, of resisting the baleful effects both of injury and morbid action. In addition to the three coats wliich I have just described, there are certain arteries of a high order, which possess a fourth, common to the accompanying veins and nerves; such for instance, is the case with the principal arteries of the neck and thigh. This common in- vestment, or sheath, is composed of dense cellular tissue, and connected to the pai'ts included within it, by an ex- ceedingly lax ceUular membrane. Having thus reminded you in a general way, of the struc- ture and properties of arteries, I now request your attention while I submit for consideration some important facts rela- tive to wounds of these vessels; as estabhshed by the expe- riments and observations of Petit, Jones, Beclaud, and others. Wlien a large artery has received a punctured wound, the following circumstances quickly succeed : on the withdrawal of the wounding instrument, the blood escapes from the vessel, and in all probabihty, some of it wiU make its way through the sheath into the neighbouring cellular membrane; or even a portion may follow the instrument out tlu-ough the wound in the integuments. Now, if the wound in the artery should be of trifling extent, the breach may be re- paired by some of the blood, at the moment it issues fi-om the aperture in the vessel, becoming entangled in the loose reticular membrane wliich connects it to the sheath; by this means, the correspondence wliich previously existed

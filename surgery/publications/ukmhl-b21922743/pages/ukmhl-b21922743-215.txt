WOUNDS OF THE STOMACH. 199 porter or ale may be administered with advantage. I have never found bark m any form, useful in such caseSj nor do I beheve that it does much good in any case, where tlie tongue is covered with a dark dry crust, and the stomach disposed to nausea, or irritabilitj'. The best local appHca- tions for tliis stage of the case consist of warm dressings and fermenting poultices. I have now placed before you, in a familiar manner, the ordinary symptoms and treatment of a case of extravasation of mine, having suj)posed it to take place in a healthy young man, in consequence of a rupture in the m-etlua. Let us now take another view of the subject, by assuming that the accident happened to an old fox-hunter of dis- sipated habits, and broken-down constitution, and inqmre if the symptoms and treatment would, or ought to be, the same, in both cases ? There certainly, would be no re- markable difference in the local symptoms, and they should be treated by incision, the catheter and poultice, as in the former case; but the antiphlogistic plan of treatment would not be apphcable in this instance at aU ; on the contrary, the patient should be watched closely from the commence- ment, and as soon as symptoms of debility shall appear, the treatment I have recommended for the second stage of the former case, should be adopted at once, in the latter.

The usual cause of extravasation in male children, is the giving way of the urethra, in consequence of a small calculus

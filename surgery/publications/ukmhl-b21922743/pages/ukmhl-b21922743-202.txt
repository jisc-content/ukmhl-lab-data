186 CLINICAL SUKGEHY. On the removal of the wounding instrument, the lipa of the wound in the intestine become everted by the action of the muscular fibres, so that the tliick mucous membrane assists in filling up the breach. At the same moment this is being accomplished, the neighbouring convolution of in- testine is forced by the action of the muscles of respiration into the situation previously occupied by the wounding instrument, and in tliis way co-operates with the everted membrane in p eventing immediate,effusion. In the course of a few hours inflammation will be estabhshed, and lymph shed from the serous surface around the wovuid; this lymph becomes quickly organised, and the aperture in the intestine permanently closed by the adliesion of the ad- joining convolution. Thus, then, you may perceive, that the lips of the wound never become united directly with each other, as in cases of simple incised wounds in the in- teguments and elsewhere; and that it is through the medium of the peritoneal coat of its neighbour that the wounded intestine is rendered capable of performing its wonted functions. When the hollow viscera become ruptured from falls or blows on the abdomen, or the passage of a heavy body, such as a cart, or carriage over the trunk, extravasation is much more likely to occur, than in the case of a wound;â€” for this obvious reason, that the violence is continued after the rupture has taken place, and forces the contents of the injured viscus out through the opening. Severe injuries of the abdomen are usually succeeded by sickness of the stomach, prosti-atiou of strength, paleness of countenance, feeble pulse, and in some instances a discliarge of bloodj either from the stomach or bowels. \Ylien tliis

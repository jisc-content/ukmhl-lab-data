Secondly.—In a case of compound fracture, Avith depres- sion of the bone, and bad constitutional symptoms, the operation ought to be performed with as little delay as possible. Thirdly.—In a case of compound fracture, with depressed bone, and a foreign body; although the coustitutional symptoms may not be urgent, the operation ought to be performed; for, in such a case, the unnatm-al state of the parts must necessarily give rise to inflammation, which may prove fatal; or if it do not, the probability is, that the patient will be subject to epilepsy, or some other disease of the brain, which wiQ tend to shorten life.

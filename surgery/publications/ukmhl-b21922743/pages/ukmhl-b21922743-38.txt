22 CLINICAL SURGERY. diseased bones^ &c. &c. The modus operandi of the actual cautery does not materially differ from that of the ordinary caustic; the superior degree of activity of the former seems to constitute the difference between them. Pressure may be apphed in two ways, with a view to sup- press hemorrhage from a wounded artery—viz., either on the trunk of the vessel, or immediately in, or at the wound itself. For example, let us suppose a person to liave re- ceived a wound of the popHteal, or tibial arteries, and that a smart hemorrhage is the consequence. In a case of this kind the surgeon should in the first instance, either make, or cause pressure to be made on the femoral artery, vmtil the necessary steps for securing the vessel at the wound can be taken. Thus, then, you are to recollect that when pres- sure is applied at a distance from the wound, the advantage gained by it is only of a temporary nature. Let us now suppose a case in which there is an extensive lacerated wound in the palm of the hand, by which the palmar arch and its branches have suffered severely, and the consequent bleeding is considerable. The best means of treating a case of tliis description would be, by a combination of styptics and pressure employed in the following manner:—a small portion of Hnt or sponge, should be dipped in a solution of alum, spirits of turpentine, or some other styptic of this class, and then inserted in the wound, so as to be apphed to the mouths of the bleediug vessels; a second compress should then be placed over the first, and so on, until by a succes- sion of them, a cone is formed, the apex being in the bottom of the wound, wlulst its base should project above the level of the skin. The compresses having been thus adjusted, should be kept firmly in their places by a roller applied

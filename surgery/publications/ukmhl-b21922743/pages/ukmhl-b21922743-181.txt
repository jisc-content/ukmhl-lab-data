LECTURE VII. 165 minate before the sixth day, I would say, that it had then assumed the clironic form. By a post-mortem examination, the follomng appearances Avill be discovered :â€”The abdomen having been laid open, the great omentum will be pushed forward by the inflated intestmes beneath. On turmng up the omentum, the peri- toneal covering of the intestines will be found excessively vasculai-: the surface of the membrane will be here and there partially concealed by patches of lymph, which also exists in great abundance between the convolutions of the intestines. If the hand be now passed down behind the pubis, and the small intestines drawn up towards the tho- rax, a large quantity of sero-purulent matter will be disco- vered both in the pelvis, and lumbar regions. Gentlemen, here I wish to apprise you of what, in my judgment, is a very erroneous opinion, as regards the state of the peritoneum in fatal cases of inflammation of tliis membrane. It is generally stated by authors, who treat of peritonitis, that the sudden cessation of pain, which usually precedes a fatal termination, is a sure sign that mortification has actually taken place. Now, I wish you to understand that my experience of this disease, and the dissections I have made of persons who died of it, have induced me to arrive at an opposite conclusion.

I am, therefore, disposed to think, it would be more in accord- ance with the principles of correct pathology, to consider the absence of pain in such cases as indicative of a fatal loss of sensibility, rather than an assurance of structural

LECTURE XI. 263 bai-;, with sixteen grains of musk, powdered, and mixed together." It is scai'cely necessary for me to tell you, that " this infalhble remed/' appears to be composed of as inert materials, as the Ormskirk medicine. The musk is certainly a powerful anti-spasmodic, and might be deemed a feasible remedy, if the disease were actually estabKslied, but how it could act as an antidote, it is difficult to comprehend. There was at one time a favourite antidote strongly recommended by Doctor Mead, wliich was composed of ash-coloured ground Uverwort and black pepper; but it got into disuse in the course of time, and even the Doctor himself lost confidence in it before his death; and recommended as a substitute "a vegetable substance called Jew's-ear" which was first introduced by a Mr. Dampier. The next specific is the celebrated powder of Palmerius, "whose power to operate a cure he believed was sufficient, even though the patient should neglect all due treatment of his wound or observation in his diet." The prescription is as follows:â€”" Take of the leaves of rue, vervain, sage of virtue, plaintain, common wormwood, mint, mugwort, balm, betony, St. Jolm's-wort and of the lesser centaury, each equal parts by weight." "When these were, to be used, they were to be reduced separately into a fine powder, a drachm of which was to be administered daily to the bitten patient, mixed with twice as much sugar, in a draught of wine, cider, or broth; or made into an electuary with honey, to be swallowed three hours before taking food." To the antidotes I have already mentioned, many more might be added, such as frequent submersion in the sea, the root of the dog-briar, "the broiled hver of the mad dog," and other delicate " morceaux" of tliis kind wliich I do not think it necessary to enumerate.

104 CLINICAL SURGERY. It is impossible for a person igiiorant of the functions of any important organ in the human body^ as naturally carried onj to be able to judge of them when morbidly affected, or to set them right when out of order. Tliis fact being an established maxim, both in physic and sui'gery, you must at once perceive the necessity, when studying injuries of the brain, of keeping constantly in mind the functions per- formed by it, in its natural state. The brain has three grand functions to perform, viz.â€”it receives through the organs of sense, all impressions from without, and is there- fore, the seat of sensation; it is also the source of the intellectual faculties, and the centre of voluntary motion. Such being the functions which the brain in its healthy state performs, it follows as a matter of course, that when it sustains a serious injury, we should look out for the effects in the derangement of some or all the functions over winch it presides. Eor instance, it is not wonderful that if the part of the brain, with which the optic nerve is con- nected were severely injured, that partial or complete blind- ness should ensue : again, when that portion of the brain, in wlaich the intellectual faculties originate, is the seat of the injury, you are to expect either partial derangement or total destruction of these faculties, proportioned to the amount of injury inflicted : in hke manner you are to ex- pect convulsions or paralysis of the voluntary muscles, if the portion of the brain with wliich the nerves of motion are connected, happens to be the part affected. Amongst the numerous phenomena, the simultaneous concurrence of wliich is essential to the well-being of the brain, and the perfect execution of its functions, there is none, perhaps, so remarkable both in a physiological and a prac-

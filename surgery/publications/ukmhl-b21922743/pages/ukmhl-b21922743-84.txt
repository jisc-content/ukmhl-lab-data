68 ClINICAt SURGERY. fumislies a fair illustration of the practice wliicli has been generally adopted in Dubhn during the last twenty years. Previous to tliis period some surgeons seemed to think that the application of one hgature above the tumour, would even in cases of diffused brachial aneurism, prove sufficient to accomphsh a cure; however, as this practice has been abandoned by its former advocates, I will not further tres- pass on your time with its consideration; but at once pro- ceed to enquire what is the most approved of plan of treat- ment in cases of circumscribed bracliial aneurism?

The surgeon who consults the feelings of his patient, and who is unwilling to cause unne- cessary paia, will in every instance try the former practice, before having recourse to the latter, which he can do Avith every prospect of success, after his efforts to accomphsh a cure by the mild or bloodless method have proved unsuccess- ful. Thus, then, in accordance with this rule, when called to attend a case of circumscribed brachial aneurism, you should in the first instance endeavour to effect a cure by means of compress and bandage, before you would tliink of having recourse to a painful, and perhaps unnecessarj- opera- tion.

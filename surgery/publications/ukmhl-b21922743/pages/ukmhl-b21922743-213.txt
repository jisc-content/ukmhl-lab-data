WOUNDS OF THE STOMACH. 197 exceedingly small and intermittent; and, finally, death closes the scene. If the description wliich I have now given of the usual effects of urinary extravasations, caused by a ruptm-e of the uretlira be correct, you must at once perceive the necessity of attention and decision on the part of the surgeon, and the fatal consequences wliich are likely to ensue, either from hesitation or ignorance. You should keep constantly in mind the pernicious effects produced by urine when, brought in contact with any of the living animal textures, â– ndth the exception of the skin, and mucous membranes. In accordance with this view of the subject, you should consider such a case as I have supposed to occur, to be one of local origin, but of a most dangerous tendency; and, therefore, when called on, apply yourselves, in the first in- stance, to the source of the evil. Taking this view of the subject, the practitioner, when satisfied that extravasation of urine has actually taken place into the cellular membrane of the perineum and scrotum, should introduce a metallic instrument of moderate size, as far as he can, without using much force, into the urethra: in all probability that will be down to the laceration, and then with a knife make a free incision through the tumefied parts until he has exposed the instrument, at the ruptiu-e in the urethra. By tliis means the urine already effused will be drained out of the cellular membrane, and in the event of more escaping from the aperture in the urethra, it will have a ready exit, and will not, therefore, become diffused through the neighbouiing parts. This being done, a gum elastic catheter should be substituted for the metallic in- strument, and passed, if found practicable, the entire way

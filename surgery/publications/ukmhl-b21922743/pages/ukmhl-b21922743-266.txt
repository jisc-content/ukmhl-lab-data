CLINICAL SURGERY. vulsed stage of hych'ophobia, but none of them took the distemper/' A gi-eat number of similar experiments attended with similar results were made by M. GirauDj M. Pauoisse, and Doctob, Bezard ; but an experiment of much importance, and wliich might lead to an opposite opinion was made in the Hotel Lieu, in Paris, in 1813, by Breschet and Magendie. On the 13th of June tliey took some of the sahva of a man inunediately after he had died of hydrophobia, and conveyed it by means of a rag a few paces from the bed of the deceased, and inoculated two healthy dogs. One of the dogs became rabid on tlie 27th of July, and bit two others j one of which was attacked with rabies on the 26th of August. This is a very remark- able experiment, and the only one, out of hundreds of the kind wliich was succeeded by such a result. When you recollect this, you should hesitate before you attribute the rabid state of the dog, to the fact of his having been inoculated. It is both unpliilosophical and illogical to draw a general conclusion from a particular instance. Again, inasmuch as the disease might have originated in the dog independently of the experiment; you should, in the present state of our knowledge on tliis subject, look upon the fact of the dog having become rabid, in the light of a coincidental cu-cumstance, rather than as conclusive evidence of the effect of the experiment. Thh-ty-tlnee years have elapsed since the experiment was performed, and I have not heard or read of any case wliich has occurred witliin that long period corroborative of the effect attributed by some, to the isolated one I have mentioned. I therefore think we are not warranted, from the facts on record whicli relate to this formidable disease, in believing that it can be

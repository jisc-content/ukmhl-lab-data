19 LECTURE II. lymph, and the establisliment of the adliesive inflammation, by wliich the artery is rendered impervious for ever. Under these circumstances, the future circulation tln-ough the limb must necessarily be carried on by means of the collateral branches, wliich gradually become enlarged for the purpose. When an artery is divided to aU but one-fourth of its dia- meter, and then left to natui-e; according to the experiments and obsei-vations of the authors abeady alluded to, it is quite possible that the individual may survive the consequent hemorrhage without the aid of surgery. The steps taken by nature, in this case, do not materially differ from those ah-eady mentioned where the division had been complete, inasmuch as the remaining foiuth becomes quickly removed by absorption, and the future cu:culation will be carried on by means of auxiliary branches. Wlien a large artery is cut through one-half of its diameter, and then left entirely to natiire, the animal perishes; or should the vessel have been previously deprived of its sheath, as in some of the experiments of Beclaed, a smaller wound may be attended with a fatal hemorrhage. Having thus briefly, adverted to the means adopted by nature in suppressing hemorrhages consequent upon wounds of arteries, I now request your attention to a few observations on the different methods employed by ari; for the accompKshment of the same object. Tlae surgical means of restraining hemorrhage may be fairly included under six heads, viz :â€”styptics, caustics, the actual cautery, pressm-e, torsion, and the hgature. Any substance capable of arresting hemorrhage without injuring the structure of the bleeding vessel, or vessels, is in sui-gical language, denominated a ''styptic." M styptics do not

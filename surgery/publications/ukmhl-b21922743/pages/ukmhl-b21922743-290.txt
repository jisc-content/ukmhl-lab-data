In a lecture on hydrophobia, dehvered in London by Mr. Lawbence, and subsequently pubUshed in the Lancet, in 1829, the following passage is to be found :â€”"In fact, the saliva of the rabid animal must be brought into contact with a recent wound or au ulcer; that is, with a breach of surface on the body.

A few years ago a case, or rather two cases sumlar to the one I have just quoted, occurred in the County Cork. A ]V[j.s.

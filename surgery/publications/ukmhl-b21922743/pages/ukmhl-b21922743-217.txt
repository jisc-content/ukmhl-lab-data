RUPTURE OF THE BLADDER. 201 urinary extravasations as take place external to the abdomen and pelvis. I trust, I have said sufficient to prepare you for the fatal consequences, which are to be expected when similar effusions occur loithin these important cavities. With a view to illustrate this part of our subject, I beg to call your attention to a few cases of ruptured bladder. CASE. RUPTURE OF THE BLADDER PROM A BLOW. William Corry, aged 26 years, a currier by trade, was admitted into the hospital on the 19th of March, at 11 o'clock, P.M., under the following circmnstances:—When brought to the hospital he was stupidly drunk; his friends stated "that he had been drinking all the day, and that towards evening he suffered much from a desire, and incom- petency to pass water; that he subsequently got into a row, and that they beheved he had been struck on the belly with a heavy stick." It was impossible to obtain any infor- mation from liimself; but the resident medical officer recog- nised him as a person, who occasionally went to the hospital to get the urine drawn off; he being subject to attacks of retention when guilty of a debauch—the immediate cause being spasmodic strictm-e. On examining the abdomen, it did not appear to be particularly fuh or tense; hoAvever^ it was deemed expedient to introduce a catheter, but no urine came away. The stomach-piunp was next employed, and brought up a large quantity of fluid, which appeared to be a compound of whiskey and porter. He was now placed m bed, and ahnost immediately feU into a heavy sleep.

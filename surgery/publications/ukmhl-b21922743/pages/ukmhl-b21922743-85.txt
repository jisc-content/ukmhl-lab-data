TRAUMATIC ANEURISMS. 69 sliould be placed over it, extending some distance up along the coui'se of the bracliial artery, and retained in this situa- tion by repeated figure of eight turns of the bandage, which should be appHed with a moderate degree of tightness. Pormerly surgeons who had faith in compression supposed that it effected a cure, when successfully apphed, by obhter- ating, not only the aneurismal sac itself, but also the artery for some distance above and below it. The eiToneous nature of this opioion is at present weU known; for it has been ascertained by experience, that severe pressure is not only unnecessaiy to the accomphshment of a cure, but the bad effects wliich may result from it clearly demonstrated. When pressure is too strongly apphed in cases of tliis kind, the imperfect aneurismal sac often gives way; the blood then becomes diffused, and the case is in every respect, rendered worse than it was previous to the apphcation of the com- press and bandage. In coiToboration of this statement, I may mention that a few years ago, a case of circumscribed false aneurism at the bend of the arm, was admitted into the Jervis-street Hospital, under the care of one of my col- leagues, who attempted to cure it by compression. The pressure havkg been too forcibly apphed, the sac gave way, and a diffused aneurism became estabbshed, for the cure of winch it was necessary to have recourse to such a tedious and painful operation as I have abeady described in the case of Lawless. In the first volume of the BuUin Journal of Medical Snence, you wiU find a veiy interesting report of tlnee cases of teamnatic brachial aneurism, wliich were treated in Stevens Hospital by Dr. Cusack. He judiciously attempted a cure, by pressure apphed over the tumour in aU these cases

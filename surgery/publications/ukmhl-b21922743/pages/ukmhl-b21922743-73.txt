LECTURE III. 57 imprudently discontinued, a cii-cumscribed false aneurism would gradually develope itself in the following manner :— The pressure of the compress and bandage having been removed, the tinorganised lymph, which hitherto filled up the wound in the artery, was gradually displaced by the stream of blood wliich incessantly rushed along its inner smface; a small portion of blood made its way into the ceUular membrane, in the neighboui-hood, which became condensed so as to form a capsule or sac, for this incipient aneurism. In a short thne a pulsating tumour would become visible at the seat of the injury, characterised by the follow- ing symptoms :—The tumoiu- would vary as to its size and density, not only in different cases, but in the same case in different stages of its development; we accordingly, some- thnes, find it not larger than a hazel nut, globular as to shape, soft and compressible; and should pressure be ap- phed to the brachial artery for a moment close to the tumour, provided the blood which forms it be not coagulated, will disappear, but when aU pressure is again removed it will return to its former state. Should this aneurism be neglect- ed it will graduaUy increase in size, and lose its globular form, and assume, in a limited degree, the shape and dh-ec- tion of the deep-seated false aneurism. You may naturaUy inquire in what respect do the circum- scribed false aneurisms, which occur at the bend of the arm, differ from the true aneurisms to be met with in the ham and elsewhere? The difference between them is weU marked and easily understood : a true anemism owes Its origin to a morbid condition of the coats of the arter\^ with which it is connected; and its sac, is formed either by the dilatation of the three coats of the artery, or by that of the

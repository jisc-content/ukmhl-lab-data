I will advert to this point at a future period, when considering the sub- ject of compression of the brain; on the present occasion, I wish to confine your attention to such injuries of the scalj) as may be unattended with any symptoms indicative of internal misclaief. The treatment of bloody tumours of the scalp is very simple; it should consist in the constant apphcation of cold evaporating lotions to the part affected; at the same time due attention should be paid to the state of the patient's constitution. To fulfil the first indication, a lotion composed of half an ounce of muriate of ammonia dissolved in four ounces of distilled vinegar, and ten or twelve ounces of distilled water, will answer very well in recent cases; but in the event of the skin becoming inflamed, an acetate of lead lotion would be preferable to the one I have mentioned. A bladder partially filled with pounded ice or snow, when at hand, laid on the part would be a comfortable and effica- cious way of applying cold. Although the utdity of cold apphcations, in dispersing the great majority of tumours caused by extravasated blood, is generally admitted, yet, its modus operandi is by no means easy of explanation. It would be absurd to suppose it could chemically exert any influence on the effused blood itself, so long as the integu- ments which cover it, retain then vitahty. We must, there- fore, attribute the beneflcial effects resulting from its appli- cation to some salutary action produced in the living textures around, wliich is conducive to absorption. A smart contu- sion of the scalp is usually productive of inflammation; indeed, in some instances the inflammatory action thus

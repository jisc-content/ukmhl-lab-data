CLINICAL SURGERY. 60 being propelled by a stronger force than that in the vein, it is natural to expect that a much greater quantity of arterial blood win pass tlu-ough this common opening into the vein, than of venous into the artery. Should this opening of communication, be of moderate size; in the course of time the following important changes wiU take place, in the vessels themselves, in the distribution of blood through the hmb, and in the hmb itself. The artery will increase in size for some distance above the wound, and according to Dr. Hunter and M. J. Cloquet, it wiU become smaller than natural below it; whilst Breschet maintains that the artery becomes increased in diameter below as well as above the wound; he further adds, that its coats become thinner and more yielding than natural, and that they ulti- mately assume a structure analogous to those of a vein. This he seems to think very natural, under the altered cir- cumstance of the case, inasmuch as he considers the blood which now circulates through the artery, must be of a mixed character. That the veins become increased in size and assume a varicose condition, are facts admitted by all, but Beeschet states, that in addition to these alterations, the veins in the vicinity of the injury and extending for some distance towards the heart, become tliicker than natural, and that they assume a structure resembhng the coats of arteries. He seems to tliink that such a change is necessary in order to adapt the vein to its newly acquired office, of receiviag and giving transmission to arterial blood. I must admit my incompetency to decide upon tliis discre- pancy of opinion, not having been so fortunate as to witness the post mortem examination of any person who had been affected either with arterio-venous aneurism, or \vith aneu- rismal varix.

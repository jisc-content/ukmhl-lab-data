8 CLINICAL SURGERY. suit some approved author, on the subject of the lecture you had heard during the day; compare the opinions of the author, with those of the lecturer, and the probability is that you will arrive at a safe conclusion. In your attendance on hospital practice bear constantly m mind, that you have a right to be there, and to all the information the institution can afford. Do not hesitate to ask the medical officers any question you think proper, in reference to the symptoms and treatment of the cases in the wards. Eemember, it is your duty to learn and theirs to instruct. Be not content with what is called "walking the hospital." You should » exercise your organs of sense in preference to those of locomotion: they are the true inlets of information; or to use the language of Aristotle, " Nihil est in intellectu qtiod non prim fuerit in sensu." Do not rely too much on the descriptions of disease given by lectiirers; the most ac- compHshed speaker will often fail to impress on the minds of Ms hearers an accurate conception of the symptoms of the case ■under consideration. Tor example, what language can clearly delineate the contracted features, the hollow eyes; and the coiuitenance, at once expressive of pain, anxiety, and exhaustion, as manifested in a patient suffering from peritoneal inflammation; or the distorted fea- tures of a person afflicted with tetanus ? It would be im- possible to describe by words, the countenance, at once ex- pressive of fear and rage, as seen in cases of hydrophobia. I feel it is scarcely necessary for me to remind you, that in our mtercourse with patients, it is our duty to treat them with kindness, and that nothing could be more cruel or un- justifiable if, when dressing wounds, or, adjusting fractures.

LECTURE IV. 79 tlie consideration of tlie iujui-ies wliicli may affect the scalp only, without necessaiily involving other parts m its vicinity. Injuries of the scalp axe more serious in then- consequen- ces, and often requii-e treatment somewhat different fromthose of a sunilar nature, inflicted m the common integuments elsewhere, for the following reasons. The scalp is very complex in its structure, being formed of skin, adipose, reticular, and fibrous membrane. Taking it as a whole, it is weU organized, inasmuch as it receives an abundant supply of blood-vessels and nerves j although some of its compo- nent parts, hold a low place in the scale of organization. The blood-vessels which supply the pericranium, anasta- mose, with those of the skull and dura-mater; and in this way, there is avascular communication established between them and the parts contained within the skull; a circum- stance which, in the opinion of most practitioners, is favoura- ble to the propagation of morbid action. When common inflammation attacks any particular part, its effects will be more or less modified according to the simphcity or com- plexity of the structures engaged; this being the case, theUj it becomes obvious that the injuries of the scalp wliich give rise to inflammation, are Hable to be attended with bad consequences; not only on account of its pecuharity of struc- ture, and high degree of organization, but also, its proximity to the braiu and its membranes. Tlie scalp, in consequence of its exposed situation, is more subject to contusions and wounds of every description than the integuments in other parts of the body. Con- tusions of the scalp seldom fail to give rise to extrava- sations of blood, for obvious reasons. For instance,

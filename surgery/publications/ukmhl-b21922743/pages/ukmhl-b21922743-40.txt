CLINICAL SURGERY. 24 literation. In tlie second method^ two pair of forceps are necessary; viz.^ one to take hold of and draw out the artery from the surrounding parts; this being done by an assis- tant^ the surgeon^ with a forceps specially recommended for the pui'pose, seizes at right angles the extended arterj'^ wliich he compresses strongly between the" convex blades of the instrument^ until he tliinks he has^ on the principle of the hgature^ which I will explain presently^ divided the internal coats; he then pushes the instrument, the blades being still firmly pressed towards each other, along the artery towards the heart, in expectation of forming a plug by the puckered internal coats of the vessel, which would resist the further circulation of blood through it. ' The completion of the cure is now left to the inflammatory' action which must result from such lesion of structure. I will not fm-ther occupy your time ui discussing a plan of procedure wliich, however ingeniously conceived, appears to me both" frivolous and uncertain, but at once proceed to make a few observations on the ligature. Of all the methods supphed by art for restraining arterial hemorrhage, the hgature justly claims the first place. I wish, therefore, to call your attention to some of the effects produced by its apphcation. At the moment a hgature is firmly tied round an artery, the cavity of the vessel is not only rendered impervious, but its mtemal and middle coats are cut completely tlu'ough; the blood must, necessarily, be determined to the collateral branches, which become enlarged for its accommodation. All that portion of the artery wliich extends from the hgature to the next collateral branch, becomes filled with a coagulimi; but should it so happen that the hgatui-e was apphed close to the origin of an

What a cruel and disgusting piece of absm-dity from beginning to end! The only rational way of accounting for the transaction, is by supposing that all the pai-ties con- cerned were in a state of mental derangement. The doctor and the surgeon were certainly the most dangerous lunatics I ever heard of! You may read in the Surgical Dictionary, of a case where a patient was trepanned with a view to relieve an obstinate headache, wliich was supposed to depend upon a tumour growing from the dura-mater; but it so happened, that there was no tumour to be found, and that the patient died of inflammation of the brain, and its membranes, caused by the operation! You will find in Mr. Deasb's work, " on wounds of the head,'' an account of a great number of cases of fracture of the skull, where the patients were tre- panned on speculation; that is, with a view to prevent bad symptoms, according to Mr. Pott's theory; but unfortu- nately, the operation appeared to have had the opposite effect, and produced consequences which ended in the death of

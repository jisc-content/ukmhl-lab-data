Why, the embarrassed operator being alarmed by the sudden gush of arterial blood, would, in aU probabihty, proceed by compress and bandage to pre- vent further external bleeding; but to accomphsh tliis ob- ject he must use a good deal of force and apply his bandage tightly. Supposing this has been done as well as the cir- cumstances of the case will admit of at the moment; what is next to be expected ? In the com-se of a few hours, the patient sufi'ering from pain and tension in the hmb, will again apply to the surgeon for rehef. On inspection the fore- arm and hand will be found tumid and livid; the swelling may not extend above the place where the hgature was applied, or it may be continued up towards the axilla.. This state of things can be easily accounted for on mechanical principles; the superficial vems havmg been compressed by the bandage, the blood is prevented from returning tlirough them to the heart; they can no longer receive the arterial blood brought to their capillary extremities; consequently, the arteries themselves become distended, and from the pressure on their exhalent terminations, a quantity of serum will become efiused into the cellular tissue in the neigh- bourhood. Thus, then, it is plain, that the swoUen state of the hmb depends, in some degree, on the congested state of the blood-vessels, and the effusion naturally resulting from it; however, in the great majority of cases of diffused false aneurism, the sweDing is cliiefiy produced by the extravasa- tion of ari;erial blood. The anatomical position wliich the blood shall occupy, must vary in different cases; this being

88 CLINICAL SURGERY. Erysipelas usually appears in the form of an inflamma- tion of the skin or sub-cutaneous cellular membrane, or both these textm-es may be involved at the same time, as is the case in the plilegmonoid form of the disease; however, it would be taking a very limited, and in my opinion, a very erroneous view of the subject, if we were to suppose that these structures only, were liable to erysipelatous inflamma- tion. I have known the worst forms of the disease to com- mence in the mucous membrane of the pharynx, and extend from thence to the integuments of the face and head, and finally terminate in the death of the patient, having pre- viously attacked the brain and its membranes. Erj^sipelas is subject to metastasis, or sudden changes from one struc- tm-e to another, leaving all intervening parts untouched, and but slight traces of its effects in the place originally engaged. Eor instance, a man may get an attack of erysipelas in the integuments of the leg, tliigh, or abdomen, wliich at the end of tliree or four days will suddenly disappear, the patient being at the same time seized by peritonitis. We sometimes find erysipelas extending progressively from place to place, by continuity of structure; you have had lately an opportunity of observing tliis form of the disease in the girl Lacy. She was first attacked with the usual symptoms of the disease behind the left ear, from thence it extended across the cliin to the opposite side of the face, forehead, all over the scalp, down the back of the neck, between the shoulders, here it spread in a lateral direction so as to include the axillary glands; it ultimately proceeded down the lumbar region and terminated its course in the skin of the nates. Different forms of erysipelas have been described by

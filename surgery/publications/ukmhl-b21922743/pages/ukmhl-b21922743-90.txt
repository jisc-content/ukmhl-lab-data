The bad effects which sometimes result from a wound of the temporal arteiy, may be either unmediate, or remote. By the former I mean an obstinate hemon-hage which is restrained with difficulty; and under the latter I would include secondary hemorrhage, traumatic aneunsm, and erysipelas. "men you meet with an obstmate case of bleeding from the temporal artery, the safest and most effectual mode of suppressing it, is by cutting the vessel itseH completely across, and in tliis way affording the cut extremities an opportunity of contracting, so that the bleeding will qmckly subside. If the original wound were inflicted by a sharp instrument, its hps should be brought together and re- tained in contact by strips of adhesive plaster, and com- presses of hnt placed over the wound. The antiphlogistic plan of treatment should Hkewise be put in force, and regulated according to the constitution of the patient, and the pecuhar chcumstances of the case. The dressings should not be removed sooner than the fourth day after theu- first application. By tliis time the wound mtII have healed, and the open extremities of the divided artery become obliterated by the adhesive inflammation, consequently, the danger of secondary hemorrhage or the formation of an aneunsmahnost, \i not altogether, prevented.

CLINICAL SURGERY. 138 consequences. When I say it may act as a foreign body, jou are not to suppose that it is as likely to act in that capacity as other animal products, such as bile, chyle, or urine, when they happen to become effused. Prom what I have already said, when speaking of bloody tumours of the scalp, you must be aware that extravasated blood is often absorbed without having caused inflammation in the parts where it had been effused. The hability to inflammation arising from such a cause, is proportioned to the suscep- tibihty of the parts into which the extravasation had occuiTed, to take on inflammatory action.

25 SUICIDAL WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. anastamosing branchy there will be no coagulum formed; for this obvious reason, that there was no resting place left in which the blood could coagulate. The phenomena which I have just mentioned are of immediate, and almost simul- taneous occurrence; but in the course of a few hours other important changes ensue: inflammation takes place in the divided coats of the artery; this, necessarily, gives rise to an effusion of lymph, wliich quickly becomes organized, so that the vessel is now obhterated by the process of adhesion. The hgature, by its pressure on the external coat, excites ulcerative absorption in this tunic, which continues until the artery becomes completely divided, and the hg^itui'e itself detached. In the course of time, the coagulum will be absorbed, and the artery degenerate into a sort of hga- mentous substance up to the next collateral branch. Having made these preliminary observations, I think we may now advantageously proceed with the special con- sideration of a few cases. They will be read for you, as noted down by our intelligent chnical clerk,, in the case- book. SUICIDAL WOUNDS OF THE THIIOAT. CASE.

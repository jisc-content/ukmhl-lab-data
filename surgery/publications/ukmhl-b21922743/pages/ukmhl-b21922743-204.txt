CLINICAL SURGERY. 188 membrane would become incorporated, by the ordinary process of adhesion, is an idea not entertained by any well-informed surgeon of tlie present day. Mr. John Bell would con- nect the detacbed pieces by a point or two, of interrupted suture : SiE, Astley Cooper and Doctoe Thompson would employ numerous points, in order to prevent effusion; whilst Mr. Tuavees, for the same reason, recommends that the hps of the intestinal wound should be carefully brought together mth a needle and tliread of silk. TMs being done the thi-ead is to be cut short, and the intestine returned into the abdomen, and the external wound dressed in the man- ner I have already described. You will naturally ask what ultimately becomes of that portion of the ligature which remains connected with the wounded intestine ? According to the experiments and observations of Dr. Thompson, Mr. Travees, and others, the hgature will be disposed of ia the following manner. Some hours after the replacement of the injured bowel; inflammation becomes estabhshed, and lymph is thrown out in the neighbourhood of the wound, in suf&cient quantity to cover the hgature exter- nally, and, at the same time, to connect the contiguous portions of sound intestine to the injured one. In the course of some time ulcerative absorption -will take place under the hgature, and proceed from the serous to- wards the mucous membrane, mitil it will make its way into the cavity of the intestine, and finally pass out of the system with the ordinary contents of the bowels. You are not to suppose that the lips of the wound in the intestine ever become directly united with each other, so as to have the continuity of the canal re-established precisely in the same manner it originally existed. Such is not the fact;

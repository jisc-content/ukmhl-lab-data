196 CLINICAL SURGERY. Urinary extravasations may be suddenly iKoduced, either by blows or falls on the perineum j or on the abdomen, if the bladder should happen to be distended at the time of the accident. Tor example, let us suppose a case in which a sportsman, wliilst in the act of riding liis horse over a fence, loses his stirrup, and is accordingly, ttaoAvn for- ward on the perineum, with all Ids weight against the pommel of the saddle. Now, in a case of this description, there wiU be much reason to suspect that the urethra has been rup- tured, should blood pass from the external orifice soon after the accident, and the patient in attempting to pass water, feels as if he were emptying the bladder, yet, none escapes externaHy; and if the effort were attended with a sweUing of the scrotum, there can be no doubt but extravasation of urine has taken place. If this case be not promptly, and properly attended to, very bad consequences wiU most certainly ensue. The scrotum, and perhaps the perns and groins, will become enormously swollen, and assume a dark red colour; gangrenous spots will soon appear on the inte- guments, through wHch, should the patient survive, sloughs of the cellular membrane, saturated with a mixtiixe of urine, and ill-conditioned matter will escape. Whilst these changes are taking place locaUy, the patient's constitution suffers severely; symptomatic fever of a low type becomes quickly estabhshed; he feels hot and restless; complains of head-ache and tlurst; the tongue is covered with a brownish tenacious matter; the secretions generaly, ^re dhninished; and the pulse is very frequent. As the case advances towards a fatal termination, aU these sj-mp- toms become worse ; dchi-ium and coma set m; the tongue is now dry and contracted; the skin is often, at this stage covered over with a urinous sweat; the pulse becomes

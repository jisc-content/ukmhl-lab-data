CMNICAI. SUK(iHUY. hydrophobia had actually recovered under such treatment. This practice has, however, been fully tested within the last fifty years, and the general belief amongst the medical men of the present day is, that it is of no use whatever, and that the cases recorded in wliich it was supposed to be useful, were not genuine cases of hydrophobia. Magendie having observed in his experiments on ani- mals, that a plethoric state of the vascular system, artifici- ally produced by injecting water into the veins, had the effect of depressing the functions of all the animals upon which he tried the experiment, the functions of the brain and nervoiis system, being particularly affected. Erom having observed these effects he was led to suppose that if water were injected into the venous system, in cases of hydrophobia, it might prove useful. This idea was further encouraged by his knowledge of the fact that the blood of animals suffering from hydrophobia has very little serum in its composition, and that in the human subject there is little or no Hquid taken mto the system during the disease. His first experiment was tried on a rabid dog, from which a pint of blood was drawn, and then sixty ounces, (about two quarts,) were injected into the jugular vein; about ten or twelve ounces of blood mixed with water, were allowed to flow out dm-ing the latter part of the operation. The animal which had been furious, became tranquil immediately after the operation; however, in about five hours afterwards it was seized with a diEBculty of breathing, wliich proved fatal in half an hour. On the 15th of October, 1823, Magendie injected a pint of water of moderate temperatui-e, into the veins of a man's arm who was suffering from hydrophobia in the advanced stage;

No, this case is an exception to the general rule; the operation though painful, and dangerous when performed on persons whose natural sensibihty is not diminished, or vital powers depressed; yet, it cannot be considered a shock " to a person destitute of feeling," and when not necessarily attejided by a serious loss of blood. The report of Currie's case states, that when " about two ounces of blood escaped, the stertor ceased; the pupils contracted, and he was able to swallow a little whey." Here, the operation instead of increasing the collapse wliich existed before, had the imme- diate effect of producing the reaction wliich ordinary means had failed to accomplish. In the case of Walsh, the accident caused so much lesion of structure as weU as depression of the vital powers, that his recovery could scarcely be expected. This much, how- ever, is quite certain, that the operation was productive of some advantage, even in his case, although he ultimately died. The report states, that the pulse was only fifty- six, and the surface cold," but soon after the depressed piece of bone was removed, " the pulse rose to eighty-six ; the surface became warm, and the breatliing free from stertor."

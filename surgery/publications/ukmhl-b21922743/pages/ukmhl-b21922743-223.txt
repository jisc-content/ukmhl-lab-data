Delirium Tremens, its Spivptoms, Fatlwlogy, and Causes.—Tie diseases with wJdch it might be confo%mded.— Three cases, ivith observations, and a comparative view of the effects of the medicines employed in the treatment of them. Gentlemen, I request your attention whilst I make a few observa- tions on the disease generally called Deliriim Tremens. This is a complaint of frequent occurrence^ yet it was only Avithin the last forty-five years that the members of the medical profession became acquainted with its real natui'e, or acquired correct notions of its pathology and treatment. Dr. PeahsoNj in the year 1741, was, I beheve, the first medical writer who gave an accurate description of the complaint, under the title of "Brain Fever." Mr. Sutton, in the year 1813, gave a still more detailed account of the disease, and called it " Delirium Tremens." Since this period, many medical men of eminence have written upon the same disease, although caUiug it by different names. Eor instance. Dr. Akmsteong calls it " Brain Fever from intoxication." Drs. Elliotson and Copeland describe it under the name of "Delirium Tremefaciens." Dr. Ryan prefers the term " Delirium Nervosum ;" wlulst Dr. Blake considers that " Delirixim Ebriositatis" is the name wliich would be most expressive of the nature of the disease;

113 LECTURE V. the first instance, have the hair shaved off, and then carefully examine the wounded or contused scalp, in order to ascer- tain, if possible, whether a fracture exists or not. If you cannot detect a fi-acture, there is reason to suppose that the case is one of concussion only; however, it may be comph- cated with compression. For example, the inner table of the skull may be driven in, although the outer one may remaia unbroken : this sometimes happens in persons in the middle period of hfe, the inner table being more separable fi'om the outer, and more brittle at this age than in child- hood. Again, blood may have been extravasated in conse- quence of some vessel having been ruptured by the accident, and in tliis way, the case may be of a mixed character. You win naturally inquire, what ought to be done in such an embarrassing case ? Before you resolve on acting, consider well the general, or constitutional symptoms, for locally, you should attempt notliing in the first instance, beyond attend- ing to the state of the scalp itself, although ch-cumstances may ultimately render it necessary for you to do something in the way of operation, in order to give the patient a chance, however remote, for his hfe. In considering what is best to be done on general principles in such a case, you should reflect as to whether existing symptoms indicate a decrease, or an increase of the vital powers; and, when you have made up your minds on tliis point, the mode of pro- ceeding must at once become obvious. The symptoms which I have aheady mentioned, such as loss of sense and volun- tary motion, palidity of countenance, fixed pupils, coldness of the extremities, stertorous breatliing, and feeble inter- mitting pulse, indicate a depression of the vital powers ; and, any treatment, wliich would have the effect of increasing

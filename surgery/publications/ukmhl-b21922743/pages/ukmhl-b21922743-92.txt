CLINICAL SURGERY. 76 the tumour presents all the characteristic sjTuptoms of aueuiism, but unaccompanied with inflammation.—Secondly, the sui-geon may see the case for the first time, when in addition to the symptoms I have alluded to, there will be considerable redness, heat, and pain in the tumour and its vicinity.—Thirdly, the surgeon may not be called on, until the integuments have in part been destroyed by sloughing and ulcerative absorption, so that hemorrhage has actually taken place. I will now suppose that a case of the first form of the disease has been submitted for our considera- tion, and ask what is the best method of treating it? Surgeons have not as yet agreed upon any fixed plan of treating such a case : you may, therefore, expect to see one practitioner employ pressure, a second would prefer tying the artery at the cardiac side of the tumour, lea\dng the latter unopened; wliilst a tliii-d would cut down at once into the sac, turn out the coagulum, tie the artery both above and below the aneurismal openmg, then divide it between the hgatures and dress the wound. Experience has convinced me that all the methods of treatment wliich I have enumerated are hable to objection, a,nd in the great majority of instances fail to accomphsh the object in view. In the first place, I never could suc- ceed hi curmg a case by compression, although I have often tried to do so. I always found that the degree of com- pression necessary to effect a cure, produced inflammation in the part, so that the second form of the disease became estabhshed; and if the pressure were stiU persevered in, the tliird stage ensued, characterised by ulceration, slough- ing, and hemorrhage. The plan of treatment by apphing a hgature on the ai-tery at the cardiac side of the tumour is

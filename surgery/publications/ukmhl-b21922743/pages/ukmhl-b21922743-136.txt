120 CLINICAL SURGERY. aspect, puts on a glossy surface, and furnishes a gleety dis- charge ; it will continue loretty much in this state until the patient dies. Mr. Pott, with whose opinions on this subject you ought to be acquainted, attributed all the internal mis- chief to what he called a sloughy state of the vessels, wliich was propagated from without inwards, commencing in those of the pericranium, and from thence extendmg tln-ough the skull to the diura-mater, which he conceived was the part witliin the skull first attacked, between which and the bone, matter was formed and always to be found. The ex- perience of subsequent writers by no means corroborates Mr. Pott's opinion on this subject. Tliis theory about " a sloughy state of the vessels" was originally promulgated by M. Le Dran; however, plausible it may appear at first Adew, it is fanciful in the extreme, and you should not attach much importance to it. It would, in my opinion, be much more correct to suppose, that at the time of the injury, the more sensitive structures, beneath the dura-mater, received a shock from wliich they never completely recovered, until inflammation became slowly and insidiously estabhshed. Mr. Dease, in his work on injuries of the head, gives an account of sixteen cases of tliis description, in wliich he trepanned the patients, in expectation of finding matter between the bone and dura-mater, and in tlnrteen of them he found tliis membrane perfectly healthy and firmly adlienng to the skull; the eflects of the previous inflammation bemg more deeply seated. In the remaining tln-ee cases he found some matter between the dui-a-mater and skuU, but in two of them, the parts beneath tiiis membrane were also affected; so that the matter was confined between the bone and dura- niater in one case only: and tliis terminated favourably.

In plii'enitis there is headache, intolerance of Light, and symptomatic fever; wliilst in delirium tremens, all these symptoms are usually absent â–  and again, the tremours of the fingers and tongue are not present in phrenitis. The inco- herent wandering of the maniac is very u.iilike the peculiar form of dehrium, which I have described, as being charac- teristic of delirium tremens; again, the maniac is not ne- cessarily affected with tremours. As to the causes of deUrium tremens, they may be fairly divided into two, namely, the remote and proximate. By the remote you are to understand tbe immoderate use of certain diffusible stimuli; such as whiskey, opium, wine, &c. &c.; to wMch the system had been, in some measure, habituated by their long continuance; wlulst the sudden omission of those stimuli should be considered as being the immediate or proximate cause of the disease. This ar- rangement may, at fu'st sight, appear somewhat strange and incomprehensible; however, I trust, by a httle reflection on the liistory of the disease, and the plan of treatment which experience has proved to be the most successful, it will not only become intelligible, but convincingly manifest. The case stands thus; a person by the continued use of a diffusible stimulus, produces and maintains for a certain length of time, a high degree of excitement in the neiTous system; which it is able either to bear or resist, to a certain extent, from the controlling influence of habit, but in con- sequence of the supervention of some cause, such as acci- dent or disease, &c., the stimulus is suddenly witlihcld ;

237 CASE OF CATALEPSY. nth.—There was a slight appearance of the catamenia yesterday morning, which ceased in the evening; in other respects she remains pretty much in the same state; loss of speech and retention of luine still contmue. 18^/^.—No menstrual discharge yesterday, but this day it retm-ned, and is abundant. The interruptions to respi- ration are frequent, and attended with congestion of the face, rigidity of the limbs, and tumefaction of the abdomen as before. '^\st.—She can articulate a few insignificant monosylla- bles, such as ' yes^ and ' nothe inordinate action of the diaphragm has nearly ceased. %hth.—All this day the catalepsis never at one time con- tinued more than one or two minutes; the convxdsion, which is very violent, lasts three or four. She is sick, and had retching three or four times. 2Qth.—About ten o'clock last night, the nurse being absent, she got out of bed to get a drink, her stomach became sick, and she vomited, she says, a clot of blood, and immediately found she could articulate. She now speaks as well as ever; says she was always sensible except when affected with a fit, but on these occasions had no knowledge or idea whatever of anything that occurred. 'IWi.—The catalepsis lasts not more than one minute. The paroxysm which succeeds is more violent than it has been at any former period. She strikes at every person about her, as if by design. She sometimes speaks, whilst in the convulsion, which ends leaving her in a sort of idiotic stupor, wliich continues for two or three minutes. January ?>rd, 1835.—On this day she recovers from the convulsive paroxysm without its being succeeded by the "■idiot stupor."

LECTURE VII. 169 M'ell, so it may, by a person very ignorant of tlie symptoms peculiar to botli these diseases. The only symptoms they have in common, are pain in the abdomen, attended with symptomatic fever; but when you compare the two cases the resemblance quickly disappears. The great prostration of strength, the sunken countenance, and small hard pulse, which are usually present, in aU weU-marked cases of perito- nitis, are seldom to be met with in dysentery, except when the disease is very far advanced; but either the absence or presence of the pathognomonic symptoms of dysentery, viz., tenesmus and muco-sanguineous discharges, decide the na- ture of the case, beyond the possibiHty of a doubt. Cholera is another disease with which peritonitis might be confounded, inasmuch as in both cases, we have prostra- tion of strength, sunken countenance, perhaps vomiting, and a small pulse. Although these symptoms are common to both complaints, still there is, in my opinion, very little danger of any person, at aU conversant with the diseases to which the abdominal viscera are hable, making so egre- gious a mistake. In peritonitis you will have febrile symp- toms; in cholera you will not. In peritonitis the ab- domen is tumid, tympanitic, and very painful; in cholera it is flat, and, generally speaking, not painful, although somewhat tender on pressure. In peritonitis the bowels are usually confined; whilst in cholera frequent copious Hquid discharges, constitute a leading symptom. In perito- nitis there are no cramps whatever; whereas, in cholera, they exist to a most distressing extent. Gentlemen, when you are about to treat a case of acute peritonitis, you should bear in mind, that it is one of tlie most dangerous diseases to which the human body is sub- r

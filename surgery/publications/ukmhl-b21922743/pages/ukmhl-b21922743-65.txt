LECTURE III. 49 median veins; the external and internal cutaneous nerves. The cephahc takes its origin from a number of small veins which run together to form it, at the radial side of the wrist- jomt, from whence it proceeds upwards, corresponding to the radius inferiorly, and to the outer or radial side of the humerus superiorly; being situated beneath the skin and superfcial to the fascia of both fore-arm and arm, until it arnves above the insertion of the deltoid muscle; along the inner edge of which it runs until it approaches the clavicle â€¢ when It dips m between the pectoral and deltoid muscles to' jom the axillary vein. The basihc vein commences its course at the ulnai- side of the wrist, and from thence proceeds upwards correspond- mg to the anterior surface of the ulna inferiorly, and to the imier or ulnar side of the hmnerus superiorly; being situat- ed beneath the skin, and superficial to the fascia, until it ascends as high as the middle thii-d of the arm, where it peneteates the latter, at the imier side of the biceps to jom the deep-seated veins of the arm. The median vein is formed by the confluence of a gi^eat nmnber of smaU veins which constitute a sort of plexus, which corresponds to the antenor or palmer surface of the wrist, immediately above the annular hgament. From this pomt the vein proceeds upwards correspondmg to the inter-osseous hgament; being Pkced, hke the other vems, between the sL and fasda' before it arnves at the bend of the arm, it divides into thr W til? .

THE USE OF THE TREPHINE. 159 of Moran and Cui'iie were saved by it; and that Walsli woxild have died on the 2,6th instead of the 29th, had he not being operated on in the first instance is quite obvious. I consider Moran's case one of pecuhar interest as being illustrative of a series of important phenomena, which occa- sionally succeed severe injuries of the head. In the first in- stance, he was knocked down by the blow, and remained for a while under the stuiming influence of concussion. Trom this state he soon recovered, so as to be able to walk a distance of half a mile, by wliich time a sufficient quantity of blood was poured out between the dura-mater and the skull, to cause symptoms of compression : these symptoms were rapidly growing worse, and would, doubtless, have ended in the death of the patient, had not the operation been performed, and the extravasated blood removed. The obstinacy with which the hernia cerebri continued to in- crease in size, so long as any attempt to restrain it by pres- sure was made, and the gradual retirement and ultimate disappearance of the tumom* when not mechanically inter- fered with, are facts well worthy of the recollection of every practitioner in surgeiy. In the case of Currie, it might appear to some persons, that I acted hastily in operating so soon after the accident, and before reaction was estabhshed. My conviction at the time was, that he must have died in a few minutes if he were not reheved at once, and consequently that reaction would never take place. The result has satisfied me, that I took a proper view of the case in the fhst instance. The usual means of bringing about reaction had been tried for an hour after his admis- sion into the hospital; and, instead of producing the de-

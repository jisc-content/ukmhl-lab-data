It is scarcely neces- sary to point out to you, the mischievous tendency of such absurd advice; you must perceive from what I have already stated, that the effused blood is useful in arresting the hemorrhage, consequently, whatever tends to its premature displacement wiU be favom'able to the continuance, or renewal of the bleeding; and, again, the pernicious prac- tice of injecting fluids into serous cavities, for the purpose of wasliing out blood, which is, comparatively speaking, a mild substance, and removeable by the action of the ab- sorbents, is so opposed to the laws of the animal economy, the principles of surgery, and common sense, that it would be an idle waste of time to enter into a formal refutation of a doctrine, wliich should never have been promulgated, and which has long since become obsolete.

CLINICAL SURGERY. 54 determined by the situation in which the wounded artery happens to be placed. Eor example, in the present instance I am supposing the artery to run between the skin and fascia, consequently, the extravasated blood must be super- ficial to the fascia, although it may extend from the axilla to the wrist. On the other hand, if the wounded artery should be situated, as it usually is, beneath the fascia and bicipital aponeurosis, very Httle, if any, of the extravasated blood will then make its way between the fascia, but wall proceed upwards and inwards in the course of the brachial artery, for the following obvious anatomical reasons:—The effusion having taken place beneath the fascia and bicipital aponeurosis, it would be prevented by these strong membranes from coming directly forward, and their close attachment to the muscles of the fore-arm would not admit of its passing down towards the hand : the biceps would not allow it to take a direction outwards; whilst the brachiahs anticus muscle, the humerus, and the internal intermuscular hga- ment would prevent the possibility of its passing back- wards ; hence it is, that it must take the direction I have described. Gentlemen, from what I have already stated, you are prepared to expect that a deep-seated diffused false aneurism would present itself in the form of an oblong swelling, ex- tending from the bend of the arm upwards and inwards towards the axilla: the density and pulsation of the tumour must vary according to the condition of the effused blood— for example, if the blood had coagulated, the swelling would then be firm, and attended with a very obscure pul- sation ; but, if on the contrary, the blood had not coagu- lated, the tumour would be soft and somewhat elastic,

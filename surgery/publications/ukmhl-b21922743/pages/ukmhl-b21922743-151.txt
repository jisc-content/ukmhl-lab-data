The thick end of the wedge was situated above, the tliiu below, having driven all the bony fr-agments you see here, and the dura-mater before it. The stone and the fragments of bone having been removed, the depressed dura- mater presented a dirty ash colour, and had rather a sloughy ajjpearance.

Unfortunately, liis friends would not allow 2lpost-mortem examination. It cannot be said, that in tliis case, the immediate cause of death was compression, produced by the stone and the depressed fragments of bone, inasmuch as the brain was capable of performing its functions for a week after the accident, although they continued to encroach on the con- tents of the skull.

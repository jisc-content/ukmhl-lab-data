PROGNOSIS OF 56 ture, by the nature of the incarceration, by the size, situation, and contents of the swelling, and by the age and constitution of the patient. The pressure on the prolapsed parts will be in proportion to the narrowness and elasticity of the tendinous opening: the progress of the symp- toms, the urgency of the danger, and the neces- sity for employing means of relief, will be in- creased in the same ratio. The slowness of the case will be according to the largeness of the opening and the weakness of its margins. A large and old rupture, which seems most formidable on the first view, is in reality attended with much less danger than a small and recent one; and it is more difficult to effect the re- placement of a rupture of the latter than of the former description. think (says Mr. Hey), it is not a bad ge- neral rule, that the smaller the hernia, the less hope there is of reducing it by the taxis. Long continued efforts to reduce a prolapsed intes- " tine are most likely to succeed in old and large hernias, when no adhesion had taken place."* An old rupture is not readily strangulated, and when it falls into this state the danger is not imminent; the distention of the opening, previous to incarceration, has so dilated and weakened * Practical Obs. p, 203.

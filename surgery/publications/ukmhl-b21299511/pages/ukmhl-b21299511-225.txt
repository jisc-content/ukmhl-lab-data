203 tNCISION OF THE STRICTURE. as far into the neck of ihc sac as it can be with- out violence, and between the protruded parts and the upper margin of the stricture. The bis- toury, with its back resting on the finger, is pushed forwards towards the abdomen, followed and supported hy the finger, which protects the viscera. The length of the incision should not exceed what is sufficient to allow the viscera to be re- placed with case,* * A French surgeon proposed to dilate, instead of cutting the stricture. He employed, for liiis purpose, an instrument composed of two blades, united like those of scissars, and forming, when closed, a concavity on one surface, and a smooth convexity on the other. It was introduced into the ring in this stat,e, with the concavity towards the protruded parts; and the blades were then expanded so as to produce a sufficient dilatation.

The difficulty and danger of cutting the stricture, and the fear of weakening the parts by the incision were the chief cir- cumstances which led Le Blanc to adopt the plan of dilata- tion. It has not, I believe, been practised in this country. Indeed, if there is sufficient room to introduce a dilator, it is reasonable to expect that the parts may be replaced. Several instiuments have been contrived for the pur- pose of dividing the ring; such are the winged director of Mery, with two lateral processes to guard the protruded parts ; the scissari of Morand, the bistouri herniaire of Ls Dran,

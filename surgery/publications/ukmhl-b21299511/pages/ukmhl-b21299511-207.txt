ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. 185 the spermatic cliord quits the ahdoniinal, canal, is closed behind by the fascia transversalis, connected to the tendon of the transversus and obliquiis internus, near its insertion in tlie pubes. When the size and position of the open- ing in the aponeurosis are considered, we can hardly doubt that ruptures would take place through it much more frequently, were they not prevented by this structure. Yet their forma- tion is not entirely obviated. We have the parts protruded ufider the edge of the transversus, and then through the lower opening of the abdominal canal. Such ruptures occur, according to Mr. Cooper*, ''if this tendon, (viz. that of the trans- versus), is unnaturally weak ; or, if from mal-for- mation, it does not exist at all; or, from violence, has been broken." I lately dissected a hernia of this species, where the fascia was neither thinner tlian usual, nor separated by any violence; but it had been protruded before the peritoneum, and formed a thick aponeurotic covering to the her- nial sac. Since the spermatic chord lies on the outer column of the aponeurosis of the obliquus ex- ternus, and this rupture comes directly over the pubes, the former part is placed on the outer side of the sac, more particularly at the point of pro- * lib.

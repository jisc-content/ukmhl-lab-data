STRANGULATION. 47 reduction, or on the division of the ring, which proves clearly the nature of the cause. The cause of stricture may exist in the mouth of the hernial sac, as well as in the tendinous aperture ; the protruded parts may be compressed by both, or by one only of these. The perito- neum, which, in its natural state, is soft, thin, and yielding, is sometimes thickened by the pres- sure it undergoes in a hernia. When this is con- siderable, the mouth of the sac is converted into a kind of callous ring. The pressure of a truss may probably assist in this process, and the effect is augmented by the surrounding cellular sub- stance undergoing the same process. In this way the part occasionally acquires a kind of car- tilaginous* hardness, fully adequate to cause ef- fectual compression on the protruded viscera. I am the more desirous to state my opinion clearly on this matter, as I had expressed a doubt in the last edition of this work, whether the neck of the sac could produce stricture. The oppor- tunities of dissection, which I have since met with, have convinced me of the affirmative. It is less common to find the cause of stric- ture in the hernial sac, at some paxt exterior to the ring. Yet such cases are occasionally seen. * ARNAur found t'^e neck of the sac entierement car- tiJagineux, epais de trois lignes."â€”T?-. des Hem. t. 2, p. 11.

301 ARTIFICIAL ANUS. an artificial anus, althoiioh it is contrary to our intentions : yet, when the continuity of the canal cannot be restored, the artificial opening is the only means of preserving life. I have already noticed the diiferent views of this subject exhibited by Messrs. Littre and Louis. The former, after removing the gan- grened part of the intestine, fixed its upper ex- tremity to the wound by sutures, and tied the lower. This method is defended by the latter, in his valuable paper on the cure of hernias with mortification, when the intestine is not adherent. He objects to the plan of La Peyronie from the unfortunate cases, in w hich the intestine has given way after an apparently perfect cure: and con- siders that the disadvantages of the artificial anus have been overrated. The feces, he observes, must be voided someivhere ; and the only diflference is in situation. External compression will supply the place of a sphincter muscle, and retain the intestinal contents until their evacuation can be conveniently effected. The latter observation is not correct; the feces cannot be retained: and, however ingeniously the case may be palliated, it miist be still regarded as one of the most distressing infirmities with which a person can be afflicted. If the complaint terminates in the formation of an artificial anus, we must endeavour to alle- viate those inconveniences^ which arise from the

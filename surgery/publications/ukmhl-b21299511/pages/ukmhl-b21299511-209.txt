ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. 187 has no connexion with the rupture behind the tendon of the obliquus externus. The latter part, or the edge of the obliquus in- ternus and transversus may be the seat of stric- ture in the ventro-inguinal hernia. Mr. Cooper's work* contains the first de- scription of this hernia, which can be deemed at all complete or accurate: but its existence had been noticed previously. CAiMPERf seems to have met with an instance of it so early as the year 1759; and Mr. ClineJ; dissected a case in 1777. Chopart and Desault§ had probably observed it frequently, as they direct the incision of the ring to be varied according to the course of the epigas- tric artery. Rougemont|1 had seen one example. The exact proportion,in point of number,betw een this kind of ruptures, and those of the species first described, has not been hitherto ascertained ; it only appears that the latter are by far the most frequent. The inguinal hernia of females does not re- quire a particular description, as its anatomy re- ^rmbles that of the same rupture in the malesub- * Chapter 15. f Edinl'urgh Review, vol. 1, p. 405, X Cooper, pt, 1, p. 51. § Traits des Mai.

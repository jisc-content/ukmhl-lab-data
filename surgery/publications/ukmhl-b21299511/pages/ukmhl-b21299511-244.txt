232 OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. Section V. Replacement of the Protruded Parts. The last step of the operation consists in returning the protruded parts, whichj if they are sound and not adherent, may be immediately performed. The limb should always be in a Essays, v. 5. Art. 21. The direction of Petit can only be understood as extending to the pushing of the sac partially, like a plug, into the ring : and not as advising a reduction of it within the ring. Monro too speaks particularly of recent cases : and they must be very recent indeed, if the sac has not become adherent to the surrounding parts. Mr. Cooper relates the case of a small inguinal hernia in the female, where the sac with its contents was returned unopened. Pt. 1, p. 49. The remarks now quoted have been considered as authorising a general practice of replacing the sac j and Lr Dran's case, which I have already alluded to, Chap. VIII. Sect. 2, if the facts could be believed, would countenance such a supposition. But a correct view of the anatomical structure strongly opposes these notions. The universal and firm adhesion of the snc to all the surrounding parts; its very close connexion to the spermatic vessels; and the difficulty of detaching it, particu- larly in the case of varieties in the position of the chord, will always constitute insuperable objections to such a proceeding ; which promises no particular advantage, even if it were easily practicable.

OF TRUSSES. 65 may affect the testicle: the integuments become red, painfull and excoriated; and the bandage must be entirely laid aside, until the parts have recovered. In Germany, where this kind is very much employed, Richter* has often seen painful tumefaction of the testicle, hydrocele, and even cirsocele, produced from this cause, and entirely dissipated by the employment of a proper truss. He also saw the pad of a non-elastic bandage excite, in the region of the abdominal ring, a considerable inflammation, which terminated after a few days in suppuration. The hernia nevei* appeared again after the cure of the abscess. The inflammation had probably extended to the neck of the sac, and obliterated that part. Elastic trusses, when well fitted, may be ea- tirely depended on, as they keep up an uniform pressure under every variation of circumstances. They yield, when the abdomen is distended; and, in consequence of their elasticity, still remain closely applied^ when its volume diminishes. The valuable properties of this instrument depend entirely on its spring, which keeps the pad constantly pressed against the herniary open- ing; and gives it a power of re-action, by which an uniform pressure is maintained under varying * Traite dis Hermes, p. 24.

OPERATION FOR LARGE HERNLE. 23j which covers the hernial sac, and make an open- ing- in that fascia. This allows us to pass a grooved director under the tendon; and the probe-pointed bistoury may be conducted;, by means of the groove, to the part that requires division. If great difficulty should be expe- rienced in accomplishing our object in this man- ner, a small aperture may be made in the sae near the ring, which will enable the surgeon to divide the tendon with ease. When the parts are thus set free, they should be returned into the belly by pressure on the swelling, if adhesions ^o not prevent this ; at all events they generally ^dmit of being replaced in part. The sides of the incision should be carefully approximated by means of sticking phiister ; and they will pro- bably unite by the first intention:â€”an event which could not be very reasonably expected, if the operator followed the advice of a writer, who recommends that the skin should be accurately stitched by means of stitches placed at a finger's breadth from each other. We thus accomplish the only rational object, ^hich the periV)rniance of the operation can be expecfed to attain; that of rescuing the patient from the dangers attendant on the strangulated state of his rupture: and we accomplish it by a method attended with the least risk.

414 UMBILICAL HLRNIA IN INFANTS. When an exomplialos in a joiing subject is treated by means of compression, we may expect a radical cure as in the use of the ligature*; ^vhcreas, in a more advanced age the emplo^^^ment of trusses serves merely to keep the parts reduced. Circumstances do not admit the use of an clastic bandage at this age. The surgeon should take a convex solid body adapted to the size of the opening. Ricutlr particularly recommends half a nutmeg wrapped in a piece of linen, for this purpose; and Mr. Cooper a portion of ivory; a piece of cork may also be used for the same purpose. When the viscera are carefully returned, let this body be placed over the open- ing, and be covered with a circular portion of sticking plaister. It may then be secured in its place by a belt surrounding the body. As the child's motions are apt to occasion a change in the position of this belt, it should be made broader in front, that it may set more uniformly; and it may be either quilted, or be strengthened by a piece of leather at this part to prevent it sfrom beconiiiig wrinkled. In proportion as the child is younger, so much the more speedily and certainly do these means â™¦ J'ai vvl beaucoup d'enfans attaqu^s d'exompliales, et je " ne men rappelle pas un qui n'ait ete gueri par I'usage du bandage, on ne peut point en dire autant des adultes," RiCHTER, Tr, des p. 236.

ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. 171 separable iiito many layers, and having in its composition tendinous fibres derived from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle : for which reason he calls it tunica aponeurotica. The latter fact is noticed also by Gunz*. SuARpf very correctly observes, that " when the herniary sac falls into the groin or scrotum, the investing membrane (of the spermatic chord), together ■with the cremastcr muscle, which covers it, be- come distended, and form^ in consequence of that violence, an absolute vagina." The exterior co- vering of the hernia is not only described but de- lineated by Wrisberg;];. He calls it velamen accessorium, and represents it in the view of a dissected oscheocele, A most explicit statement of the anatomical structure, with some exlcellent views of the parts, will be found in Camper§, from whom I take the following quotation:— " Cremasteres igitur musculi sunt, ab oblique tricatn, Tubingen, 1722; and in Halleri Disput.

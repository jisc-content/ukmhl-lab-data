Generally no feces pass by the anus; but the mucous secretions of the large intestine are occasiona]ly voided, of a whitish colour, and various consistence. Desault ob- served a case in w hich these evacuations amounted to a considerable quantity. A singular case is described by my much valued friend. Dr. Cheston* of Gloucester ; where the feces are not discharged through the wound, although there is an opening in the in- testine. The latter part can be seen in the bot- tom of the wound, with its two ends at a distance from each other.

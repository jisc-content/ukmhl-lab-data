71 OF TRUSSES. the shoulders: we may sometimes accomplish our object, without making any addition to the truss, by merely changing the position of the hook to which the strap of the truss is fastened: when the pad rises too high, this hook should be placed towards the lower part of the plate, and vice versa. A truss exactly adapted to the figure of the body will probably not need such addi- tions. The measure for a truss is taken by passing a string round the body, from the point at which the viscera are found to protrude, in that situa- tion which it is intended that the instrument should occupy. In order to obtain a more exact representation of the form of the trunk, it is proposed to take the measure with a double flexible wire, which may be bent exactly to the form of the parts. In either case, the alteration, made by covering the spring, requires that an inch should be allowed beyond the measure.* * The following Works may be consulted on the Construc- tion of Trusses :â€” De Launay, Bandage Elastique pour les Hermes; Mim* de VAcad. de Chir. t. 1, p. 697.

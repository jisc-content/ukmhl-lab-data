388 UMBILICAL HERNIA. the parts ar*; most frequently protruded at one side of the umbilicus: but Mr. Cooper* is of opinioii that they usually take their course through that opening itself. It seems probable that there may be a difference in this respect according- to the period of life at which the complaint occurs. The umbilicus,, which is a kind of cicatrix, formed after the separation of the funis, by the contraction of the parts to which that chord was connected, arrives by a slow and gradual progress at the degree of firmness and solidity, which it possesses in the adult. Re- maining for a long time weaker than the rest of the abdominal parictes, it offers but a feeble obstacle to the protrusion of the viscera: the resistance however increases with time; the navel becomes stronger than the surroundhig parts, and prevents more effectually the escape of the bov^els. These anatomical facts will furnish us with two pathological inferences, the truth of which is supported by experience. First; that infancy is more subject than any other age to umbilical terniÂ£e, properly so called, where the viscera are protruded through the navel itself. Secondly; that adults are more exposed ta that species of * On Crural and Umlilical Hernia^ p. 35. I

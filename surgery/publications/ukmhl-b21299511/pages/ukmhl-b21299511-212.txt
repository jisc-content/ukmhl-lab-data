190 SYMPTOMS OF INGUINAL RUPTURES* Section I. Symptoms of Inguinal Hernia. The inguinal hernia possesses the common symptoms which have been mentioned in the general description of the complaint. The addi- tional circumstances, which bestow a distinctive character on this particular species, are derived from the situation of the swelling. The tumour extends from the abdominal ring to various dis- tances in the scrotum. It is first perceived in the groin, and descends gradually in front of the spermatic chord. The testicle maybe felt belosv or behind the swelling, and the spermatic chord can sometimes be traced at the back of the tu- mour. It always appears to extend into the ring, and is hence distinguished from most other affec- tions of these parts. The rupture assumes a very different appear- ance, when it is contained in the abdominal canal. The tumour in such a case is always very small. According toRiCHTF.R and Sabatier, ingninal epiplocelc is most frequent on the left side, in consequence of the omen- tum hanging lower on that side. Traite des Hermes, p. 20Q.

RADICAL CURE OF RUPTURES. 98 diate connexion of the hernial sac with the cavity of the abdomen, the facility with which inflam- mation spreads over continuous membranous sur- faces, and our entire inability to limit its progress to the desired spot, are very strong arguments against this proceeding. They expose the pa- tient to a risk, which the desire of removing a mere inconvenience cannot justify*. The proposal of Dessault for the use of the ligature in umbilical hernia will be explained in the chapter on that subject: the propriety of operating on irreducible cases is considered in the next chapter ; and the methods, which have been recommended to promote the radical cure, in the operation for incarcerated hernia, will be exa- mined in the section on the operation. * See the eases quoted in the preceding chapter, page 80.. to shew the danger of trusses which exert a strong pressure.

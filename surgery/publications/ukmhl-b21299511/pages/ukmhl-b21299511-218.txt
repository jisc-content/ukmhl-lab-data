196 SVMPTOMS OF INGUINAL RUPTUREST, together with the peculiar sensation excited hj pressing the tumour, sufficiently discriminate the case of a testicle on its descent. When this organ is placed in the groin, it may, in some cases, be pushed partially into the ring, and it afterwards descends. The application of a truss would pro- bably occasion such pain as to discover the nature of the case, even if the absence of the part from the scrotum had not been perceived. Scrotal hernia may be combined with anj affection of the chord or testis ; and such a com- plication renders the diagnosis more difficult. If we can return the protruded parts, the nature of the other disorder will be more easily determined: and the history of the case will probably assist in elucidating the subject. Since the round ligament is not liable to those disorders which attack the spermatic chord and testis, the diagnosis of inguinal hernia, when it occurs in the female, is not so obscure and diffi- cult as in the male. It may be mistaken for crural hernia, as I shall explain in the chapter on that subject. The ascent of the uterus occa- lions it to disappear during pregnancy.

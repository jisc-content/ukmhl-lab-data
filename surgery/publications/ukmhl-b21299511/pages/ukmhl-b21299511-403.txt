OPERATION FOR FEMORAL RUPTURE. 5Sl When the tightness of tlie stricture prevents the operator from using his finger as a guide, hevviU employ the grooved director, introducing it as near as he can to the pubes. In both cases tlie blunt end only of the curved knife should be passed beyond the stricture, that the division may he effected without risk to the arteries, in case they should not follow their usual course. The intestine should be protected by the operator's left fore-finger while he is using the right hand in cutting the tendon ; and if both his hands are employed, it may be held aside by an assistant; for the depth at which the stricture is situated from the surface, and the narrowness of the opening occasion some danger of injury to this part. This mode of operating will entirely avoid the spermatic chord, and the epigastric artery in the ordinary course of the vessel. It must be allowed, that in the less frequent distribution, which has been described above, the obturator artery will be endangered. The risk is not suf- ficient to induce us to exchange this for any other method, that has been hitherto proposed ; as I operation has always appeared to me (o be very aukward and objectionable. He employs a director and curved knife, hold- ino- each of these in one hand, and then moves them both toc^cther alons the surface of the bone. P. 45 and 40.

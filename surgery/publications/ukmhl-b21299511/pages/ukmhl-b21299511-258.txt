S36 OPERATION FOR LARGE HERN I.E. ciimsfances of the case. The operation, vs hich iias been just described, would not be advisable in a hirge, old, and adherent hernia. The sepa- ration of the preternatural connexions is often extremely tedious and difficult; and the violence, which must necessarily be inflicted in executing this part of the operation, renders the subsequent occurrence of inflammation extremely probable. The extensive surface, which must be exposed by laying open the whole of a large hernial tumour, constitutes a source of great danger to the patient, who in these cases is generally advanced in years, and therefore less able to withstand an extensive inflammation and suppuration. In addition to these circumstances, we must recal to our me- mory the fact stated in the third chapter, of the impossibility, which sometimes occurs, of keep- ing the returned parts in the abdomen, after they have resided for man^' years in a hernial sac. We must likewise consider, that the ring is so much dilated, that the hernia will certainly form again, and consequently that there can be no expecta- tion of a radical cure from the operation. These reflections will induce ns to adopt the practice of removing the stricture without opening the tu- mour. The operation will be pejfornK'd - by making an incision of two or three inches in length through the integuments over the abdo- minal ring. We then dissect down to the fiiscia.

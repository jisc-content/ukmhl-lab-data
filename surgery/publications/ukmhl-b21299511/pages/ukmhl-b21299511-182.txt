160 AKATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. the tendon of the external oblique, the posterior and thinner is attached to that of the transversus ; but the lower portion of this tendon, together with the corresponding part of the transversus, goes wholly in front of the rectus muscle. The lower margin of these two muscles (the obliquus interims and transversus), which arises from about the upper half of Poupart's ligament, is found behind or within the outer column of the abdo- minal ring, and is fixed in the pubes behind the ring.* A thin fascia is extended from the inner or posterior margin of Poupart's ligament behind the transversus, on the surface of which it is gra^ dually lost. By this the ring- of the external ob- lique is closed towards the abdomen; and but for this there would be a direct opening into the cavity of the belly behind that ring.f The fascia * The attachment of the transversus to the pubes is no- ticed by WiNSLOW, Sect. 3, § III, and by Gunz, OLs. Anat, Chir. de Herniis, p, 18. f It has been hitherto an almost universally received opinion, that the abdominal ring is covered by peritoneum only at its posterior surface; and consequently that the con- tents of a rupture are protruded directly from the abdominal cavity. Were this a correct representation, inguinal hernia ■would be much mor<r: frequent than it actually is. The follow- ing quotation from Righter will shew the opinion generally held on this subject. After describing the aperture in the -tendon of the obliquus externus, he proceeds thus j " Derriere

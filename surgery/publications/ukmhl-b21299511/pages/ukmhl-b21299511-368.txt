346 JINAT03IICAL DESCRIPTION of relieving the stricture^ are correctly stated in Mr. Hey's valuable work*. * That a gentleman whose professional employments arc so extensive as those of Mr. Hey, should find leisure to publish the results of his experience in a work not less valuable for its clear and appropriate style, than for the solid information which it conveys, is much more extraordinary, than that he should have expressed himself not quite so clearly on some anatomical points. Let it be remembered that Mr. Hey, without the advantages of scientific communication and inves- tigation afforded by the metropolis, had developed circum- stances in the anatomy of femoral hernia, and adopted a mode of operating in that complaint, which had escaped the notice of those whose opportunities were much more ample. In the second edition of his work, I feel confident that all obscurity will be removed ; and for this reason I might have suppressed the above remarks had-it not appeared more just towards Mr, H. by re.printing them, to take the opportunity of adding an explanation communicated to me in a letter from that gentle- man. It will convince the reader that the femoral Ugament is just the junction of the semi-lunar edge of the fascia lata, with the thin border of the crural arch ; and it will account for the description being applicable in different points to both these parts. V^^'hen I wrote that description, nothing had been pub- *' lished on the anatomy of femoral hernia, except Gimber- NAT'S pamphlet. I did not fully understand this at the first " reading, and incautiously laid it by; determining, however, " to take such opportunities as might offer of searching for '* the part which caused the stricture in that species of hernia. " In doing this I resolved to keep the parts, as far as possible, in their natural state. I therefore did no more than remove " the integuments from the fascia lata of the thigh externally.

4S9 IN THE FEMALE. forty-six, a canal of llie size of a goose's quill, leading- through the ring into a small cavity that would admit the finger. Wrisberg* has par- ticularly investigated the subject. In nine- teen out of two hundred female bodies, he found an opening, generally on both sides, but sometimes on one only, leading through the ring into the groin or labium, lined by peritoneum, and placed over the round ligament. These canals in different instances would admit a probe, a quill, or the finger. It has not been ascertained that these diverti- cula become closed, as the communication be- tween the tunica vaginalis and the abdomen does. Nor does it seem probable that their existence much favours the occurrence of ruptures. * De testiculor. descensu, &c, ยง 34*

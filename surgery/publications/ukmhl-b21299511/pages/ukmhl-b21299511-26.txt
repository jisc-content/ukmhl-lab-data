GENERAL DESCRIPTION 4 Section I. General Description of Ruptures. Surgeons have established three general di- visions of hernije, according to the three principal circumscribed cavities of the body ; viz, those of the head J chesty and abdomen. The latter onlj are the subject of this work; and they are by far the most numerous class. The mobility and va- rying bulk of the viscera, the pressure which they experience in all considerable efforts and motions of the body, and the yielding nature of the con- taining parietes are circumstances greatly facili- tating the origin of these complaints. The passage of any of the abdominal viscera, from the cavity in which they are naturally con- tained, into a preternatural bag, formed by the protrusion of the peritoneum, constitutes a hernia* * The origin of this word has been variously explained : some derive it from tpoy, a branch ; others from hfereo, or the old adjective, hernias, hard or rugged. The Greek k»)V*), a swelling, from which the termination, cde, in the nomenclature of ruptures is derived, has been drawn from x»Xiw noceo, oxyethxw laxo.

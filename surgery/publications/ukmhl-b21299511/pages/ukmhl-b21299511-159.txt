13T TOBACCO CLYSTER. The beneficial effects of tobacco do not de- pend on its purgative power, as I have already stated that purging clysters are nearly ineffica- cious. It not onlv excites the action of the in- testi.:es, but exerts a peculiar depressing influence on the system at large; it reduces the pulse, and l)rings on nausea and sickness, cold sweats and fainting, under which circumstances the parts recede spontaneously, or may be returned by the slightest pressure. Its use should be continued until these effects are produced; the quantity required for this purpose varies considerably in different persons. Mr. Cooper has seen two drams,, and even one dram, employed in the form of infusion, prove fatal to the patient*. In other cases, two ounces have been consumed in the smoke apparatus before the necessary effect was smoke does not operate so powerfully on the nervous system as the decoction. The administration of the smoke is often attended with considerable trouble and inconvenience from the apparatus being damp, or out of order, so that the decoction has grown into more general use : and it must be allowed that this is the most certam way of employing the remedy. Yet I think that the smoke can be employed to a greater extent, without (ear of the consequences, than the the decoction: and this is an important point, since the remedy often fails from not being continued long enough, * Anatomy, &c. of Ing. Hernia, p. 24. The smoke seems to have been fatal in a case observed by Dbssaujlt ; CEuvres, 2, p. 344.

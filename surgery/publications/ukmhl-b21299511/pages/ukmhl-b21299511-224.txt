INCISION OF THE STRICTURE. 203 Section II. Incision of the Sti^icture. The contents of the hernia, being thus ex-' posed, may sometimes be returned into the abdo- men, without dividing the ring; and they should be so replaced, if it can be done without force. When this cannot be accomplished, the finger should be introduced gently into the neck of the sac, in order to ascertain the seat of the stricture. The incision of this should be accomplished by a curved probe-pointed bistoury* guided by the finger of tlie operator, which will guard the protruded parts: should the tightness of the contraction exclude the employment of the fin- ger, itÂ» place may be su{)plied by a grooved director, the protruded parts being at the same time carefully drawn aside to avoid all risk of wounding them. The finger should be carried * The operator generally employs the crooked knife, which is contained in his pocket case of instruments 3 the bjade of which is moveable on the handle. It would be r^iuch more convenient for operating on herniae, to have one with a fixed blade, or, at all events, one of that construction in which the blade becomes lixed when the knile is opened.

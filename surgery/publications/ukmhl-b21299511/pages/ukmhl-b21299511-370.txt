348 ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION the crural arch, and between its thin border and the external iliac vein. Protrusion of the viscera, under any other part of the tendon, is prevented by the attachment of the iliac fascia. The situ- ation of the descent has been rightly stated by Pott* ; but it is erroneously represented in several works, which are usually considered as of the highest authority. PETrrf and SabatierJ speak of the parts descending in some cases over the psoas magnus and iliacus internus. Calli- " interval between Poupart's ligament (the anterior border of **â–  the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle) and the '' posterior sharp edge of that ligament, which I called " femoral ligament, were occasionally at such a distance from *' each other, iii their natural state, ' as to allow the whole contents of a rupture to be contained in the interval,' as you " express it, p. 222, Lawr. on Hernia. To understand my '* meaning it must be observed, that I had divided Poupart's '* ligarnent (its anterior border) and thereby so relaxed the " parts as to permit " some of the sound intestine to slip out of the abdomen,' Under these circumstances I had in- creased the distance of the posterior sharp edge, from the *' integuments, and could then push up a considerable part " (certainly not the whoje) of the rupture into the interval. " This I meant when I said ' it passed' into the interval; the '' hernia remaining strangulated by the posterior edge, which I " believe with you is generally the true seat of the stricture." * Works^ vol.

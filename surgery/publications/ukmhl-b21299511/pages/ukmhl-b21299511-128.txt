The parictes of the abdomen have become so far adapted to the diminislied quantity of the viscera, that tlie sudden introduction of a large additional bulk could not be borne. A patient, who per- sisted for a long time, under the direction of ScHMUCKER*, in keeping* the parts reduced, was brought into a state of the greatest extremity, which absolutely compelled him to remove the truss. This gentleman has seen many instances of the same kind: Petit has even known the practice to prove fatal: the application of the truss after reduction caused nausea and vomiting, and other distressing symptoms, which rendered its removal necessary, yet the hernia did not come down again, nor did the symptoms cease ; and the patient died, as it appeared upon dissection, from inflammation of the peritoneum.f In the case of an irreducible omental hernia of moderate size, a truss with a hollow pad may be recommended, but an enterocele will not bear this treatment. Mr. Cooper has accomplished the reduction * Chirurgische Wahrnehviungen, vol. 2, p. 243. In two cases, where Arnaud had returned large herniae, vehement colic compelled him to remove the bandage, and let out the parts. They were afterwards replaced more gradually.

UMBILICAL HERNIA Ix\ INFANTS. 401 at the navel in crying', the occurrence of a rup- ture appears pr{;bable. Aithough we should have expected these hernia to occur very soon after birth, it appears from the numerous observations of Desault, that they take place most frequently at the second, third, and fourtii months ; he states indeed that the complaint appears at this period in nine cases out of ten. It is at this time that the umbilicus begins to contract in the formation of that cica- trix, which opposes the protrusion of the viscera in the adult The abdominal contents, protruded against the opening by the repeated cries of the child, distend and dilate it, and, carrying before them a portion of the peritoneum, form a small tumour, which gradually increases in size, and possesses the usual characters of a rupture. The presence of the protruded parts maintains the umbilicus in an open state, and opposes the natural tendency of its margins to contract. This disposition however sometimes exceeds the resis- tance of the hernial contents, and, forcing them back into the cavity, obliterates the opening through which they had proceeded, consolidates the parts, and thus produces a spontaneous cure. Desault has furnished us with two examples of this kind*. A child of two years old was brought * QLuvres Chirurgkales de Desault par Bichat, torn, II. p. 3J8, D d

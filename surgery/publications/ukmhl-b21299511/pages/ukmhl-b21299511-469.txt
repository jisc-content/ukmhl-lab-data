Sometimes the in- terval between the recti is unusually broad, and the linea alba weak: such a formation would be favourable to this kind of rupture. There is no danger of strangulation, since the base of the tumour is usually the broadest part: and the opening in ail cases is very free. An observa- tion recorded by Petit* shews us to what extent these dilatations may proceed, and should incul- cate the necessity of an attention to them in their commencement. An infant, in whom a weakness of the linea alba was observed, wore for a long time a corset, that laced in front, and supported the whole abdomen.

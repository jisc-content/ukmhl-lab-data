186 ANATOMY OF INGUI^AL RUPTURES. trusion. But I have seen the chord behind the sac, as in the more ordinary form of the com- plaint. The epigastric artery is situated on the outside of the mouth of the sac. Its course is not at all disturbed by the rupture : and it is consequently found, as in the natural state, at about three-fourths of an inch from the upper and outer extremity of the lower opening of the abdominal canal. Since the parts are protruded, in this case, in so different a direction from that which they pursue in the two species last described, the sac is not covered by the c rem aster muscle. How often it may be invested by a protrusion of the fascia transversalis, I cannot hitherto determine. In dissecting this species of rupture, the spermatic chord, covered by its muscle, is found at the outer side of the sac. The latter part goes directly upwards, instead of upwards and outwards. The reflection of the obliquus exter- nus exposes the lower edge of the obliquus in- ternus and transversus crossing the neck of the sac immediately behind the lower aperture of the abdominal canal. By turning these aside, the continuity of the sac with the abdominal cavity is exposed just over the pubes, and the passage of the epigastric artery, at about half pr three quar- ters of an inch on the out side of the mouth of the sac, is brought into view. The spermatic chord

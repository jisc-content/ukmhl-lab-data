CONSTRUCTION AND USE 76 dered lapis calarainaris will remove these ef- fects. The pad of the truss should be placed over the opening, at which the viscera have protrud- ed : hence^ in a small, or recently formed ingui- nal rupture, the proper position for it is consi- derably exterior to the pubes, and rather above that bone. The surgeon must, in all cases, en- deavour to ascertain the precise point at which the rupture has taken place, and that is the right position for the pad. When he is going to apply the truss, he will place it round the pelvis, and put the patient into the recumbent position. Having carefully replaced the whole protrusion, he presses on the opening with one hand, and with the other applies the pad of the truss in its proper situation, holding it there until he has ad- justed the rest of the instrument, and fastened the strap to the plate. The patient will follow the same plan in applying the instrument himself; and the most convenient time for this purpose is before he rises, as the viscera generally re-enter the abdomen during night, and have no disposi- tion to descend again until he assumes the erect position. When the bandage is applied, the patient rises, and the surgeon examines it carefullv in every point, to see whether the skin is folded, pinched, or too much compressed in any situa-

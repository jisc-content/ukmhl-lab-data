91 OF RUPTURES. an incision throuo'h the scrotum; dissecting: it carefully away from the integuments and sper- matic vessels; opening it in order to push up the protruded parts; tying' the neck as closely as possible to the abdominal ring, and then cutting oir the remainder below the ligature. He prac- tised this with success in two cases. DEssAULxf cured a congenital bubonocele at the hotel Dieu, by placing a ligature on the mouth of the sac. The risk which arises from exposing the cavity of the abdomen is incurred in this manner of operating; and the ligature on the neck of the sac must be regarded as a probable source of irritation. As a means of general employment in reducible scrotal ruptures, its merits rest on the same grounds as those of the other me- thods. The object of the proceedings above described was to close the mouth of the sac, and thereby to prevent a future protrusion. We may add, that if the end was attainable in this way, any of the measures would probably be sufficient. But, in truth, something more is required; we want a remedy that should contract the tendinous open- ing: for while that remains preternaturally large, anew protrusion is a highly probable occurrence. A cure might be expected in recent cases, which f Recueil Periodique, t. p. p. 29O.

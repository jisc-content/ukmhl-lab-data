ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION 354 The upper end of the falciform process passes over the upper and outer part of the neck of the tumour ; it is then folded under the crural arch, and continues into the thin posterior border. The iliac vein is placed on its outer side; the pubes is directly behind it; and the upper and inner parts are bounded by the thin posterior edge of Poupart's ligament. It is this part which forms the strangulation, as any person may easily ascertain, by passing his finger into the neck of the sac, or by thrusting it, in the healthy subject, into the corresponding part. The merit of first discovering, and of making public this fact is due to Gimbernat. Thd Stimi-lunar portion of the fascia being fittached to the crural arch at the point, at which the hernia comes out, contributes in some degree to the stt ailgulation, as we may ascertain by pass- ing the finger in the course of the rupture. In- deed the upper boundary of the crural ring is formed by the continuity of the falciform process with the thiir border of the crural arch : and, as this is the seat of the stricture, both these parts served, in dissecting such a case, " that the hernial sacenlus " was thick, and easily divisible into many laminoe of coats." Lett. 34, art, 15. Mauchart also noticed the fact " Saccus herniosus etiam in hernia crurali duplex est," &c. Sec Hat.t,er, Disp. Chir* t. 3, p. 152. But it was not generally understood until the publication of Mr. Cooper's work.

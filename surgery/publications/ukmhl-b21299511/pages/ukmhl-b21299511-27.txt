5 OF RUPTURES. or rupture, according to the most common ac- ceptation of these terms.* The protruded portion of peritoneum is called tlie hernial sac. This, with its contents, either passes through some natural opening in the ab- dominal parietes, as at the ring; or is forced through some part, where there is ordhiarily no perforation. The cavity of the rupture is, therefore, continuous with that of the abdomen ; and is lined by a prolongation of its serous mem- brane. The same causes, which first produced the complaint, or others of an analogous nature, are constantly tending to promote its increase. Hence the peritoneum, feebly opposed by the cellular membrane, and integuments, is extended * The term is employed frequently in a more vague sense. Various aftections of the testis, its coverings and vessels, have been denominated false, in contra-distinction to those above defined, or true hernias. They do not fall within the scope of the present work. Again, hernioe have been distinguished as internal or external: the latter consisting of obvious tumours formed in the mode indicated by the definition; while the former are instances of strangulation caused by certain internal changes of position, not indicated by external swellings, as when the bowels pass through an aperture in the diaphragm, or are confined by preternatural bands of adhesion, A com- pliance with common usage, which regards these as species of hernia, leads me to notice them in this work, although they do not come under the definition. The existence of a peri- toneal covering is not essential to the notion of a hernia; since tiiat of the bladder wants this character.

OF RUPTURES. 7 We should hardly have supposed, a priori^ that the peritoneum is susceptible of such consi- derable extension as it frequently sutFers in cases of hernia. Scrotal ruptures often descend to va- rious distances on the thigh, sometimes indeed even to the knee: vet the whole inner surface of the bag, in which all the loose viscera of the ab- domen may be contained, is lined by a continua- tion of peritoneum ; indeed the hernial sac is ge- nerally thicker and stronger in proportion to the size of the tumour, and to the duration of the complaint. Yet, occasionally, instead of an in- /treased thickness, we observe the opposite process of absorption or thinning, in large ruptures: in some cases the coverings are so reduced, that the convolutions and vermicular motions of the intes- tines may be distinguished through the skin; hence, it may appear that the sac is entirely wanting; but it will be possible to trace it in the neighbourhood of the opening. The contents of a rupture may be Ibund immediately under the skin, w hen the hernial sac has been burst by a blow ;* but this is an unfrequent occurrence. The exterior covering is every where closely femoral hernia he found the coverings so thin, and the integu- ments so firmly consolidated to the sac, that the first cut pene- trated its cavity.—Ibid. * Cooper, pt.

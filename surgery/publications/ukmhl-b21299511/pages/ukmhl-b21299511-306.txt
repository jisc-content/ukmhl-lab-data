284 TREATMENT OF RUPTURES ^vhen they form an angle: and the prospect of union is diminished in proportion to the smalhiess of the angle. As the uniting medium must con- sist of granulations, the contraction subsequent to the process of cicatrization afl'ects the diameter of the canal at this part. The appearances exhi- biled on dissection are such as this view of the process would lead us to expect: viz. adhesion of the gut to the abdominal parietes, diminution of its diameter, and a greater or smaller angle at its junction*. As the edge of the opening in the intestine is every where adherent to the surround- ing parts, the formation of the cicatrix may re-establish the continuity of the canal, although * Cases of hernioe with mortification, which have reco- vered, and been afterwards exannined, are described in the fol- lowing works, Giorvale di Medicina ; t.

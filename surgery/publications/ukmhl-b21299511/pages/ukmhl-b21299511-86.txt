CONSTRUCTION AND VSt 64 wliich they derive from these bandages^ we shall not fail to regard them as the most useful pro- duction of modern surgery. A well contrived bandage should exert a sufficient and uniform pressure, without incom- moding the patient, or being easily susceptible of derangement. The different kinds of herniary bandages may be reduced to the two classes of elastic and non-elastic. The latter are composed of leather, fustian, dimity, or similar materials. These can- not be at all depended on, and should, therefore, be entirely banished from surgery. Since the size of the abdomen varies, according to the dif- ferent states of the viscera, and to the motions of its parietes in respiration, a non-elastic ban- dage must vary constantly in its degree of tight- ness, and keep up either too great or too little pressure. The omentum or intestine easily slip out when the opening is not exactly closed, and the patient who wears such a bandage must be in a state of constant insecurity. Those who lead an active life, or are obliged to use laborious exertions, will be more particularly exposed to risk. If the patient, after experiencing these defects, endeavours to remedy them by drawing the bandage tighter, he may confine the viscera, but he produces other inconveniencies. The in- creased pressure injures the spermatic chord, and

By confining the patient to bed^ by re- stricting him to a light and sparing diet, and by the employment of Ycnesection;, calomel, purga- tives, and clysters, Arnald* accomplished the replacement of a vast scrotal rupture, which had existed from infancy ; and succeeded in numerous herniae which resisted every other method. His assertions on this subject are corroborated by the testimony of Le DRANf, who witnessed the pro- gress of many of his cases. The same plan has been successful in several instances in the practice ofMr. Hey.J ' This treatment must induce a general state of weakness and relaxation, particularly favourable to the return of the protruded parts: it must also operate powerfully, by causing the absorption of accumulated fat, in reducing the bulk of the her- nial contents. For the latter reason we should expect it to be particularly successful in such ruptures as consist, for the most part, of omen- tum; and the recorded experience on this sub- ject justifies our conclusion. In combination with the measures above described, considerable assistance may be derived from keeping up a con- * Aknaud on Hernia, p. 292.

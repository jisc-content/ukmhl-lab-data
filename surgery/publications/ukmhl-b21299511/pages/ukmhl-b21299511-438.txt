When the tumour is small in size and redu- cible, it may be kept up hy means of a truss made like that for bubonocele. The pad and neck of the truss should be continued in a straight line with the rest of the spring; and the latter part ought to extend beyond the spine*. When the patient is very fat, so that the navel is depressed, the concavity may be filled, according to the suggestion of Mr. Cooper, by an hemisphere of ivory, on which the pad of the truss should rest. When the size of the tumour is larger, the best truss hitherto devised is one represented in the work of Mr. Hey ; for which we are in- debted to the ingenuity of W. Marhison, instru- ment maker at Leeds. An oval rins: of steel is made to fit the front of the belly; from one side of this a spring extends towards the centre of the oval^ and has connected to its cxiremiiy the * RiCHTER lias found a truss of this kind to answer very well in umbilical rupturess.

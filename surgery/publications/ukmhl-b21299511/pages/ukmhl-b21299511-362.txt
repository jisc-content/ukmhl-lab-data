ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION 340 Here the two divisions of the fascia lata are con- tinuous. The great sapliena vein passes over the last-mentioned fold^, and opens into the femo- ralj where that is not covered by the fascia lata. On the inner side the oval depression is not defined by any boundary. The fascia covering* the pectineus is continued behind the femoral vessels, and the handle of a scalpel may be passed on its surface in this direction;, so as to elevate them. The femoral vein is covered by a dense fibrous substance, which completes its sheath in the part where it receives the saphena. The femoral artery and vein, surrounded and connected by a compact fibrous substance, are 'covered in front, immediately under the crural arch, by that part of the fascia lata, which terminates in the semi-lunar edge; and they lie ou the produc- tion, continued over the pubes from thQ iliac fascia. " pbatics which enter with it, completely from the large ves- sels lying beneath the fascia j and over tlie edge of (his " process we in general find an oblong conglobate gland folded, *' one half stretching beneath the aponeurosis ; the other de- *' scends above it, and thus between the two portions this duplicature is interposed. On the outer side of the dnpli- " cature we discover the vena saphena lying in a hollow, or " channel, which is covered only by the superficial thin layer " of fascia, and which leads us up to the crural foramen of ^' GiMBKRNAT, situated between the great vein and the cres- " centic fold at the pubes j and, in femoral hernia, it is in " this hollow, which may be called the vagina of the sapheiitc " vein, that the gut is lodged,"

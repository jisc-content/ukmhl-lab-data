The ruptures which appear after debilitating diseases, and those which occur in persons, who, from a state of corpulency, become suddenly emaciated, must be referred to weakness, n Penetrating wounds of the abdominal parietes have been considered as strongly predisposing to herniae. Such cases are not sufficiently common in general practice, to enable me to decide. I do not remember to have seen this effect pro- duced in any instance. Richerand observes on this subject, that herniae seldom fail to occur, however firm the cicatrix may be, unless a band- age be employed as a means of prevention: and that they may be expected with certainty after any considerable bruise, which destroys the pow- ers of resistance (ressort) of the parietes.* He mentions a case in which there was a sabre wound, about an inch in length, in the right hypochon- drium, which healed regularly. The patient wore no bandage after his recovery, and at the end of eighteen months there was a hernial swell- ing, equal in size to two fists. This could be easily replaced and retained,f * jVosographie Chirurg. t. 3, p. 317. f Il-id. p. 319.

The mortified a'ut is the centre, from which the inflammation extends: this part almost invariably adheres to the parietes of the cavity, and to the surrounding- viscera, as well as to the hernial sac. Othcs parts of the canal, above the stricture, are not infrequently found in a gangrenous state. The disorder within the cavity is not always so great; and in some instances it is confined nearly to the protruded viscus. On these diiferences the events of particular cases must in great measure depend. The probability of a favourable event is much greater in some kinds of rupture than in others. It has often happened, that the strangulation has included a part only of the diameter of the gut. In several cases of this description the feces have been discharged in part only through the morti- fied opening: this quantity has diminished gra- dually as the wound healed, and the patient has* completely recovered*. If the gangrene has only attacked one or more small spots, the event of the case may be similar.

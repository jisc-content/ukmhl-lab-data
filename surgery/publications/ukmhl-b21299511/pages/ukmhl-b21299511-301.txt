WITH MORTIFICATION. 279 scribet with such minuteness and formality, that an inexperienced person might suppose they had been all tried in actual practice. They have, ho wever, fortunately been very seldom em- ployed*. Some cases, in wh'ch the divided intestine has been suc- cessfully united by means of sutures, have been laid before the public. Ramdohr, who first proposed the introduction of the superior into the inferior end of the gut, cured a patient by that process, after the removal of a piece of intestine of a foot in length. (Sec a dissertation of Moebius in Hallebi Disp. Anat. iom.W, also Heister//2^/z7. chir, p. 8I7.) A case of a similar kind is recorded in the Mem. de VAcad. de Chir. torn. III. p. 188: another in the llecueil Periodique^ torn, XXIII. p. 361 : and a fourth in Schmidt Dissert, de Ileo, (see Creutzenfeld Bibiioih. Chirurg. p. 844.) Fa- vourable cases are also mentioned in the Recueil Periodique, 21, 26O: 26, 448: and 56. In the only instance which I know of its being attempted in this country, it failed com- pletely, although tried twice : see the Case quoted below. The favourable result of several experiments on the union of divided intestines by means of sutures, in dogs, has afforded an argument for adopting this practice in the human subject. But the cases are not sufficiently analogous to warrant this mode of reasoning. The different effects of injuries and ope- rations on animals and the human subject; the very different state, both of the constitution and part in a healthy dog, and in a man labouring under a strangulated rupture; and the dif- ferent structure of the intestines in the two cases, render it impossible for us to apply inferences drawn from such experi- ments to the treatment of a mortified intestine.

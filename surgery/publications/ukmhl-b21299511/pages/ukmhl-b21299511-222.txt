$00 OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. contains a small quantity of fluid;,* the discharge of which shews that the cavity is penetrated; and as this fluid gravitates towards the lower part of the tumour, that should be selected for dissecting down to the sac. As this fluid is not always present, the sur- geon cannot depend entirely on its appearance as indicating that the cavity is opened. The blood vessels of the intestine, and its smooth polished surface distinguish it from the hernial sac, which has not those vessels, which is rather rough and cellular on its surface, and which is always con- nected to the surrounding parts, although these adhesions in a very recent case may be but slight. The operator must remember, that, when the sac is opened, a probe or the finger will pass freely in any direction within its cavity :f the division of the exterior investment often leads him to sup- pose that he has cut into the true hernial sac. * The fluid of the hernial sac is sometimes accumulated in very large quantity. Schmucker has seen a quart of water in a rupture—(Fermischte Chirurg. Schriftcn, vol. II. p. 55.) Mr. Pott has often found so large a collection in old omental hermse., that it was necessary to puncture them for its dis- charge—{Works, vol. II. p. 39.) Monro removed six pints from an old scrotal rupture, to the great relief of his patient, (Edinburgh Essays, vol. V. p. 259.) f The accidental circumstance of adhesions between the investing membrane and the contained parts hardly deserves ts) be mentioned as an exception to this observation.

iRTIFICIAL ANUSJ 3U bj Ij'ing in bed on the right side, the protruded parts would gradually return, and the pellicle could be easily removed, when they again came down. He had married, and got children: he was robust, when Albinus examined him, in the fortieth year of his age. A white mucus was discharged almost daily per anum ; and aome- times, particularly if he retained the protrusions within the cavitv, a thick tenacious white riiatter came away with considerable difficulty. He en- joyed the best health when he ate a sufficient quantity to satisfy his appetite. Bread and rrieat; with a little strong beer, agreed with him best: they were retained nine or ten hours, and always underwent considerable alteration before they were discharged. Bread made of fine flour was the best. Ripe fruits, leguminous, and other fresh vegetables were hardly retained two hours; they were discharged nearly unchanged, some- times without loss of colour; and not mixed with the other food. But if much fat or butter were taken with them, they w ould stay longer; even for three dajs, in some instances. When he drank too much, the protrusions swelled, and much air and liquid came through the superior portion with the excrement: and Hquids, taken without solid food, would run off in less than two hours.

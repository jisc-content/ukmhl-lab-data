ARTIFICIAL ANUS. 297 had recovered from a morlified hernia, Ihe feces ceased to pass per anum; nor could any stools he procured: the belly became distended. The surgeon made an incision into the intestine^ and, by extracting from its cavity a foreign body, formed on a piumbstone, completely relieved his patient*. Section IV. Ariificial Anus*. The action of the \Ahole alimentary canal on the food is not essential to the continuance of life; and its difl'erent parts are not, in this point of view, of equal importance. The process of di- gestion in the stomach, the separation of the nutritive from the excrementitions parts, and the absorption of the former in the small intestine are indispensihle; but the large intestine seems* to be little mor6 than an excretory tube for the * Journal de Medecine for June 1787. The case is also annexed by the French translator of Richtbr to the Trait/ des Hernies, p. 306. * The memoire sur les anus conlre 72ature contained in the 2nd volume of the CEuvres CkirurgicaUs of Desault gives an excellent account of this subject.

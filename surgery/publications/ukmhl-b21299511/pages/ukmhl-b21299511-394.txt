TREATMENT OF t Pt. 11. p. 13. S?2 under the necessity of making; use of a direc- " tor. In no case, in which I have operated, did there appear the least probahility of reducing the prolapsed parts, without previously en- " larging the aperture*." I am happy to find that the opinion of Mr, Cooper, as expressed in the second part of his most valuable work on hernia, coincides so com- pletely with my own experience on this very important point. This gentleman notices the comparative smallness of the crural rupture ; and states that he has found the means of reduction less frequently effectual in this, than in the in- guinal hernia, which he ascribes to two causes, viz. the unyielding nature of the parts, through which the hernia descends, and the smallness of the aperture, forming the mouth of the sacf. He adds that the delay of the operation, which " he lamented and condemned, when speaking of inguinal hernia, is to be still more deprecated in the crural; for death very generally hap- pens earlier in the latter disease than in the former." The relation of a case follows, in which death took place in twenty-one hours and a half from the accession of the symptoms. In * Practical Ohs. p. 150.

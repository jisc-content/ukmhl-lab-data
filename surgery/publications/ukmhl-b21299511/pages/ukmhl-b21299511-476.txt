HERNIA OF THE BLADDER. 454 A bubonocele taking place through the abdo- minal canal gradually brings the upper opening behind the lower one, so that we can conceive the possibility of the bladder being drawn through the ring in the subsequent increase of the swel- ling. But the relative positions of the opening, and the bladder, render the occurrence of cys- tocelemore probable as a consequence of the ven- tro-inguinal rupture. These points have not yet been determined by actual observation. It will be obvious from the preceding ac- countj that the urinary bladder must be very differently circumstanced^ in respect to its cover- ing of peritoneum, from the more ordinary con- tents of hernial swellings. When the anterior part of the viscus is protruded, without the fundus being drawn into the ring, it will be every â€¢where adherent by cellular substance, and pos- sess no sac at all. This was the case in an instance recorded by Mr. Pott*, where, how- ever, the bladder had descended to the bottom of the scrotum. When the fundus or side liave been protruded, the posterior part of the swel- ling only adheres to the surrounding parts, and there is a bag formed by the peritoneum in front. The cellular adhesions in both cases are such as * See the " ohservalions on ruptures,'' in the third vol. of Iiis works; case xxiii.

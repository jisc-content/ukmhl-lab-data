WITH MORTIFICATION. 267 injected twice a day, at ten in the morning-, and six in the evening;. The patient was nourished in this way for thirty-six days, during- which time he became thin and weak. When the upper part of the canal was cleared of its contents, pure bile flowed through the wound, producing pain and excoriation, which distressed the patient ex- ceedingly. A spoonful of broth was occasionally given by the mouth, to obviate these effects; and a small quantity of excrement again appeared at the groin. The wound improved in its appear- ance, and contracted in size : pressure was used, and caustic occasionally applied to the edges. After the opening had contracted, so as to pre- vent the passage of the feces, a fetid moisture, discolouring the linen, still came through for fourteen days, and then ceased. Section II. Treatment -where a small Spot only has mortified. When a larger portion of intestine has de- scended, it may be affected with gangrene, in one or more spots, the rest remaining comparatively sound; or it may have become mortified through a greater or less extent of its whole diameter.

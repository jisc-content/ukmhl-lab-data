VAGINAL RUPTURE could be easily introduced; the tumour disap- peared; the superior part of the vagina felt lax and flaccid ; and the finger could be pushed up to the mouth of the uterus, till the swelling began again to increase bythe urine collecting in the blad- der. The use of a pessary produced a perfect cure. Three other cases of large swellings in the vagina, reduced by the employment of the catheter, and again increasing, were communicated to Sandi- FORT by a very skilful physician, who practised midwifery. Mr. Cooper* mentions two cases in which the urinary bladder was protruded at the upper and front part of the vagina. Pressure on the swelling occasioned a discharge of urine, and left the part loose and flaccid. The swelling came on again, as the urine collected.

In the second part of his work, Mr. Cooper has described, under this name, a peculiar case very much resembling the vaginal hernia. The * Pt. 2, p. 66.

CAUSES OF When it is stated that hernia has sometimes appeared to be hereditary, the meaning of the observation mnst be, that there is a certain weak- ness in the original formation of the parts, pre- disposing to the complaint, and that this defect may descend to the offspring; and in this sense its truth cannot be disputed.* I believe that the word hereditary, in its application to disease, has been always used according to this interpreta- tion ; and that the employment of it in its strict sense has only been suggested by those, who wished to shew their ingenuity in refuting an absurdity of their own creation. The dilatation of the openings, through which herniae take place, in consequence of the disten- sion of the abdominal parietes during pregnancy, accounts for the greater frequency of ruplures in general, and of the exomphalos in particular, in women who have borne children. The occur- rence of umbilical hernia, after dropsy, may be explained on the same ground. * " On ne pent point nier, que cette cause predisposante des hernies ne soil hereditaire : je ne pretends pas plus que des peres attaques des hernies engendrent toujours des enfans, qui seront affectes de cette maladie, que je ne pretends, qu'ils en- gendrent toujours des enfans, qui Icur ressemblent: mais on observe quelquefois I'un et I'autre. J'ai vu des hernies sou- venues spontanement et sans aucune cause exterieure ^ des en- fans, dont les peres avoient des hernies." RiCHTEB, lib. cit. p. 10.

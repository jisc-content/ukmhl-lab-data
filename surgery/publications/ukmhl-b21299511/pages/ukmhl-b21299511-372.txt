350 ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTIOJJ parts resist the increase of the tumour downwards^ and the larger quantity of cellular and adipous substance at the bend of the limb offers less resis- tance, it comes forward to the surface, so as to lie in general in front of the crural arch. For the same reason it extends outwards, or towards the ilium, assuming an oblong shape, with the long axis parallel to the crural arch. In conse- quence of this structure, the hody of the sac forms a right angle with the neck; and that part of it, which, if it had continued to descend in a straight direction, would have been the lowest part of the bag, or the fundus, is actually the anterior portion. Dr. Monro* probably means to describe this peculiar course of the hernia, when he speaks of the swelling being " tilted upwards" on the crural arch. That portion of the sac, which lying under Poupart's ligament, may be called Its neck, is generally about half an inch in length, and is frequently more. When we consider that the strangulation takes place exactly where this contracted portion communicates with the ab- dominal cavity, and that the parts are covered by a considerable thickness of adipous substance, we shall expect to find the strangulated part at a great distance from the surface. * Ol'servations on Crural Hernia, p. 84.

386 OPERATION rOR FEMORAL HERNIA, tuiiities of trying both operations prevents m& from forming a decisive opinion on the compara- tive merits of this proposal, and that which I have aUeady recommended. The thin edge of the crural areh has always appeared to me to bÂ« so materially concerned in forming the stricture; and it is so clear, that a division of this part affords much more room than that of any other, that I consider Gimbernat's method as meriting the preference. A wound of the intestine can only be ascribed to the want of sufficient care on the part of tlie operator*. * It must be acknowledged that the tight>ness of the stric-^ t'.ire, and its depth from the surface are serious difficulties in performing this operation. If, therefore,^ sufficient room eould be gained by dividing the parts between the mouth of the sac and the crural arch, on the anterior part of the rupture, in the way recommended by Mr, Cooper, that method would be preferable. And, when we consider that the falciform process is folded in at this part, and connected to the tliin border of the arch, there can be no doubt that the stricture would be relieved to a certain degree. I would therefore ad\isc this plan, with a caution not to extend the cut through the arch 5 and if sufficient room were not gained, the process recommended above may be followed. As my opinion on this subject is not derived from practice, I did t)6t ihink proper to alter the view, which I had given in the lirst edition of this work..

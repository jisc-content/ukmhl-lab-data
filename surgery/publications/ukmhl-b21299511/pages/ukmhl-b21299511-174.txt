159 TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED RUPTURES- tends it, must be ascribed, in the majority of cases, to its being delayed, until the state of the pro- truded parts, or of the patient's general system, is such, as to leave little chance of success. It is hardly necessary, in the present day, to combat the opinion, that any time previous to the actual occurrence of gangrene, is early enough for the operation. Inflammation, when it has pro- ceeded to a vehement degree, will certainly end in gangrene; and persons have often died of in- carcerated hernia, without the complaint proceed- ing to the termination in mortification. The danger of delay has appeared so clearly to the best writers on the subject, that they have taken great pains in inculcating the necessity of an early recourse to the operation. The most ce- lebrated practitioners on the Continent agree on this point with the great surgeons of our own country; and the dangerous and fatal eff*ects of de- lay are strongly represented in many parts of their writings*. Several extracts from works of the highest authority might be adduced in support of this assertion: but I shall content myself with * See Pott's N^orks, vol. 3, p. 286.

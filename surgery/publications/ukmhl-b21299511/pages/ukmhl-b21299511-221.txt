OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. 199 beniorrhage to induce ns to secure it before we proceed. The cellular substance intervening- between the skin and hernial sac, and the external invest- ment of the latter, should be carefully divided, layer by la_yer, with the knife and dissecting forceps. An operator^ who is not well acquainted with the anatomical structure, may conceive that lie has opened the sac itself, when he has divided the outer covering only, where that is close and firm in its texture. To avoid all risk of cutting through the sac, and wounding the prolapsed parts, each successive layer may be elevated with the forceps, and divided with the knife inclined somewhat towards the horizontal direction : this precaution should be more particularly observed as we approach the sac. It is sufficient to dissect flown in this way at one part: the opening in the sac maybe made by elevating it with the forceps, and dividing the apex of the elevated portion with the knife held horizontally ; or we may use the finger and thumb, pinching up the membrane between them, and rubbing them together in order to ascertain that none of the protruded parts are included. The aperture should be en- larged in both directions with the probe-pointed bistoury, guided by the finger or director, imtil the whole cavity is laid open. The sac generally

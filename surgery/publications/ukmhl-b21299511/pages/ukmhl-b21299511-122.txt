TREATMENT OF 100 Adhesions of the parts proceed probably from the occasional irritation which may be derived from pressure of the ring: and other accidental causes may assist, in a neglected rupture, in pro- ducing this elTect. They assume various forms, and exist in very different degrees. Sometimes there are tolerably long and separate filaments ; sometimes the parts arc united into one mass by a close and general connexion. The consistence of these adliesions is equally various. The pro- truded viscera may adhere to each other ; to any part of the hernial sac ; or to the testis, vvlicre they are contained in the tunica vaginalis. Adhesions frenerallv occur in old hernia', which have been left to themselves, and seldom, if ever, returned. They may also exist in recent and small cases. The omentum contracts such connexions very readily, and much more fre- quently than the intestines. Hernije, vvhich have been incarcerated, will very probably go into an adherent slate; in consequence of the inflam- mation which they have experienced. In old and neglected ruptures we may expect adhe- sions a-s well as enlargement of the protruded viscera. It is often difiicult to dctcmiiue whether ad- hesions are present, except from the obvious cir- cumstance, that the tumour cannot be reduced, If the swelling can be replaced in part onlv, the

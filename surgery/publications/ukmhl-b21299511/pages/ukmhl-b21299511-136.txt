114 TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED RUPTURES. have been its more immediate or remote conse- quences : and the danger of the subsequent ope- ration must be greatly increased if the attempts at reduction are ineffectual. We usually grasp the tumour with one band, while the other is placed at the aperture, where it niay be employed in facilitating the entrance of the parts^ and in keeping up those which have been already returned. Success will often be obtained by exerting a general pressure on the whole surface of the swelling; in which method, both hands must be employed in order to subject the entire tunsour to the action of the force. This method is strongly recommended by Petit*. The pressure should be exerted according to the Course in which the parts have been protru- ded : Urns, the contents of a bubonocele pass obliquely downwards and inwards; those of a femoral rupture downw ards and then forwards; yet we should not confine ourselves entirely to such a kind of pressure as the course of the her- nia would suggest; but, in failure of those at- tempts, make other trials in different directions. The following manoeuvre will sometimes succeed in a bubonocele or scrotal hernia, after " le boyaa gangrene, anx antres i1 etoit creve, et les maticres " ffkales repandues Uahs le ventre.' * Libro citato, p. 323â€”328,

?8 CONSTRUCTION AT^D USE thereby protects the ruptured person from all the dangers, to which the existence of his complaint would otherwise expose him; but, if continued for a sufficient length of time, even affords a prospect of a radical cure. The constant pres- sure of the pad keeps the neck of the sac empty, and this part, together with the surrounding ten- dinous opening, contracts, in obedience to the general law, by which all hollow parts of the body adapt themselves to their cont^^nts. Some- times the truss excites a kind of slow inflamma- tion, which produces an actual agglutinaiion of the sides of the aperture. The appearances on dissection exhibit to us very clearly the effects of the constant pressure now alluded to. I lately met with two very large and apparently old scrotal herniac in the same subject. On one side the omentum was adhe- rent, the mouth of the sac very large, and the abdominal ring greatly dilated. Here of course no truss could have been worn. The ring pre- sented the same appearance externally on the opposite side; but the hernial sac was empty, although its extent and the greatly enlarged state of the cremaster muscle covering it, with all other circumstances indicated that it was an old, and had been a very large rupture. The mouth of the sac was closed hy slight adhesions, and gathered into folds, and the cellular substance

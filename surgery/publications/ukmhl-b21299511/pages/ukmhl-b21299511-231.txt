STRICTURE. 209 INCISION OP THE of the tendon of the external oblique does not al- ^vaJs set the parts free ; and the surgeon should in every instance pass his finger in the direction of the rins;, to ascertain whether aiiv further stric- ture remains to he divided. If the incarceration be caused by the upper opening only, there can be no necessity for en- larging the ring of the external oblique; unless it should so confine the finger of the operator^ that he cannot reach tlie stricture. This circum- stance can hardly happen, when the incision of the integuments has been begun sufficiently high: yet it did take place in the case which I now proceed to relate; and of which I am induced to mention the particulars, because they are inte- resting in several points of view. CASE. A MAN about fifty years of age had been subject for many years to a rupture, which could be returned without difticulty. Constipation took place on the 24th of January, 1806, and, as it could not be removed, he was brought to St. Bartholomew's hospital on the 30th of the same month. His belly was distended, but not pain- ful ; and a slight degree of sickness was present. p

OF RUPTURES. 9 some other languages^ indicate an opinion of this ^ind, which might naturallj arise from a super- ficial observation of the circumstances frequently attending the origin of the complaint. The older surgeonsj conceiving the peritoneum to be inca- pable of sudden extension to a sufficient degree, distinguished the herniae of sudden origin from those of more gradual development, in which the J admitted the existence of a sac. In refer- ence to the mode of their formation, 'they called the former, hernife by rupture; and the latter, hernife by dilatation. Experience has shewn this distinction to be unfounded ; and has proved that ruptures of both descriptions have sacs :â€”a con- clusion, which correct anatomical views would certainly have suggested. When I consider the texture of the peritoneum^ and the mode of its connexion to the abdominal parietes, I cannot fanc}^ any attitude or motion that could possibly tear the membrane : this opinion is fortified by the impunity with which the harlequin and tumbler practise every motion, and throw their trunks into everj contortion, which the bony fabric will admit; and must lead us to regard with an eye of Suspicion, if not to condemn as fabulous, the case of rupture related by Garengeot.* The * A young woman, after throwing her trunk suddenly backwards, felt immediately a considerable pain in the abdo- men. Gareng*ot discovered a crural hernia, on which he

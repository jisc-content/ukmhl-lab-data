GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 151 we operate while the parts are uninflamed, the risk of the operation only is endured.* Our conduct must not he guided merely by the duration of the case ; the kind of strangula- tion, the nature of the symptoms, the effect of the means emplo^yed, and the state of the parts, must infl uence our detcrminatioH. Small and recent herniae, or such as, having been kept up for a long tim,e by means of a truss, are suddenly re- produced, admit of ver}' little delay. The stran- gulation is violent in such instances ; and inflam- mation and gangrene soon come on. In old and large ruptures, which have been often dow n, and often replaced, the symptoms are not so urgent, nor the necessity of operathig so pressingf. We grant, that the event of the operation, under any circumstances, is uacertain: but tliQ unfortunate termination, which so frequently at- * " Certum iiujus operationis periculum de nimia opera- tionis dilatione pendet, si aegroti jam viribus exhaust! partes " elapsae gravissima phlogosi, in gangraenam prona correptoe, ^' et morbus ad reliqua contenta abdominis propagatus fuerit." Callisen, pars poster, p, 478. f I have nnentioned some instances already, (note in chap- ter 1, section 5,) where strangulated hernia proved fatal within one day. Le Dean his related a case in which the operation was performed on the seventeenth day, and the parts were not much affected.——Obs. 57.

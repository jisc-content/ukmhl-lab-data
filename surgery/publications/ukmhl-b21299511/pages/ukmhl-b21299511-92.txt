70 CONSTRUCTION AND USE vessels, and admits of protrusion above. When it rests flat on the opening, and bears equall}' on all parts, the pressure is divided so as to cause no pain or inconvenience. The size of the pad should be sufficient to cover the opening, and allow a few lines over in every direction. A patient, who is ruptured on both sides of the body, must have a spring extending round the back and sides of the pelvis, and terminating anteriorly in two plates, each of which is fur- nished with a cushion for the hernia of its ow n side. A strap, sewed to one plate, and attached to a hook on the opposite side, serves to connect these together. A double truss is sometimes made with two distinct springs, but it does not possess the stability of the former kind. The distance between the two openings must be care- fully marked in taking the measure for a double truss, and accurately observed by the maker in executing his instrument. When in inguinal or crural ruptures the pad rises higher than its proper situatior, the truss receives the addition of a thigh-strap, which passes from the back of the spring under the af- fected thigh, and is attached to the plate by itieans of a hook. The inconvenience arising; from the opposite defect, in which the pad sinks too low, must be remedied by a band going over

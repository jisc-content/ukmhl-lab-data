TREATMENT OP RUPTURES ^70 remains close to the ring, we may lay aside all fear of eflusiou into the abdomen. The wound of the operation affords the most ready exit for the fecal matter, which never penetrates into the cavity. We should not, however, be justified in expecting the feces to spread over the abdomen, even if the intestine were not exactly r.gainst the ring. Petit*, in his excellent memoirs on Effu- sions, has long ago refuted the commonly received notions on this subject, both by facts and reason- ing : he has clearly shewn, that the contents of the intestine, or blood, shed into the abdomen, do not spread loosely over the cavity ; that the pres- sure of the respiratory muscles affords the obstacle to such an expansion ; that the effused matters^ being evacuated in opposition to considerable re- sistance, are collected in one spot, to which they become confined by the inflammatory agglutina- tion of the contiguous parts, and where they form, what the French call a depot. We may then safely conclude, as the annexed cases will most clearly demonstrate, that the alimentary matters, effused from a mortified intestine, will find their way through the wound, and not be spread over the cavity. *" Memoircs de l"Academic, torn.

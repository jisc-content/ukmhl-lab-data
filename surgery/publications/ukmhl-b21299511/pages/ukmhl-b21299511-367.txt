These expressions, together with the representations of its lying deeper than Poupart's ligament, of the possibility of feeling its sharp edge by thrusting the finger on the inside of the femoral vein from the abdomen, and the directions which are given to divide it by cutting in the deepest and most interior part of the stricture, would lead us to conclude that the author was describing the thin posterior border of the crural arch. But in another place he calls it a part of the fascia of the thighj and this description, with the repre- sentation in the annexed plate, would rather induce us to suspect that the semi-lunar edge of the fascia lata is the part alluded to. After these few remarks on the subject, I have great pleasure in adding, that the leading points in the anatomy of femoral hernia; viz. the protrusion of the vis- cera on the inside of the iliac vein; their strangu- lation by a part of the crural arch, which is felt when the finger is thrust down towards the thigh in this direction; and the important practical fact, that the division of this part is the right way * Practical Ohs. p. 154. f Ibid, p. 151. + Ibid, p. 153.

OF THE FEMORAL RUPTURE. 335 Hence lias arisen the appellation used by Gim- BERN AT of the crural arch. The 'parts, which have been already enume- rated, fill up the space between the crural arch and the os innoniiuatuni. The crural veisels, placed in the smooth slope on the front of the pubes, arc situated laterally with respect to each other. Next to the thin edge of the arch is the vein, with the artery lying externally to it. An absorbing gland is sometimes found between the vein and the tendon; or else this space is only occupied by loose cellular substance. Since the tendon of the obliquus externus is stretched like a cord between two distant points, and there is a wide space under it, the student will suppose that protrusions of the abdominal viscera under its edge must happen very readily. This is eft'ectually prevented by the attachments of certain fasciÂ®, conlBning the tendon closely to the surface of the parts, which it covers. The iliacus internus, and that portion of the psoas magnus, which lies by its side, are covered by a thin fascia, arising insensibly on the surface of the muscles, and intimately connected with the metodo de opcrar en la hernia crural, dedicado al rey nucstrn senor Don Carlos IV. The English version quoted above was axcciued by Dr. Beddoe*.

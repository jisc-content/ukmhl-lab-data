158 ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. Section I. Anatomical Description of the Openings through which Inguinal Ruptures take place. The aponeurotic expansion, which consti- tutes the tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, besides its connexion to the whole length of the hnea alba, is attached to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and to the upper part of the pubes. Its lower margin, which is rather thickened and stretched between these two points, is best known by the name of Poupart's or Fallopius's ligament, and is now very commonly described under tlie term of the crural arch.* As the fibres of the apo- neurosis pass obliquely downwards and forwards, they separate into two distinct portions, which constitute the pillars or columns of the abdominal ring. The upper and inner of these is fixed to the symphysis pubis: the lower and outer (which is indeed the above-named ligament of Poupart) * For further particulars concerning this part the reader iiS referred to the " Description of the parts in which the fe- moral rupture is situated."

168 ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. The description of these parts is the same in the female, where tlie round ligament of the uterus supplies the place of the spermatic chord ; except that the opening in the tendon of the ex- ternal oblique is considerably smaller. Section II. Anatomical Description of the first Species of In- guinal Hernia; viz. that which comes through the Abdominal Canal. The great majority of inguinal ruptures come under this description. The viscera arc protrud- ed through the opening left between the two por- tions of the fascia transversal is, and under the margin of the internal oblique and transverse muscles: they pass through the abdominal canal, and come out at the aperture in the tendon of the external oblique muscle. The mouth of the sac is the upper opening of the canal, and is there- fore placed nearly in the middle of the space be- tween the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the angle of the pubes : from this point the neck of the sack extends obliquely downwards and inwards between the aponeurosis of the ex- ternal oblique, and the fascia transversalis: and

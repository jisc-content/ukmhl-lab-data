If a surgeon should think proper to remove the mortified portion of intestine, and to unite the divided ends, the simple plan of approxi- mating the edges by means of three or four sutures, placed at equal intervals, would be pre- ferable to any more complicated method. When the intestine above and below the mor- tified part is not adherent. La Peyronie has recommended, after the removal of the dead por- tion, that a ligature should be placed, in the mesentery so as to draw this part into a longi- tudinal fold, and thereby approximate the two ends of the gut. He fastens this ligature on the outside of the wound, in such a manner as to retain the open extremities near the ring. The successful event of some cases treated on the above plan, seems to justify the principles on which it is founded*. If indeed its employment with no better success in the hands of the French surgeon BoYBR. After removing four inches of mortified intestine, he introduced the upper into the lower extremity over a cylin- der of card. The manoeuvre was very difRciilt; and the return of the part, when thus distended by the foreign body, recjuired a fresh incision of the ring.

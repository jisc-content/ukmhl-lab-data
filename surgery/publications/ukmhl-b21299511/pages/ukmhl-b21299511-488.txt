VAGINAL RUPTURE. 466 CHAP. XXIl. VAGINAL RUPTURE, The tumour, in this casC;, is contained in the cavity of the vagina, and its external surface is formed by the membrane of that canal. The peritoneum is continued from the back of the bladder to the front of the uterus, without cover- ing any portion of the vagina. When the mem- branous cul de sac formed between the two organs is pushed downwards, a swelling takes place at the upper and back part of the vagina. From the rectum the peritoneum is continued to the in- ferior surface of the vagina, of which the poste- rior half is covered by that membrane. A pro- trusion in this situation must form a swelling at the lower and middle part of the canal. The immediate contact of the vagina with the rectum and bladder prevents this kind of tumour from presenting exactly at the middle of the upper or lower surface of the canal, and occasions it to assume generally a lateral position.

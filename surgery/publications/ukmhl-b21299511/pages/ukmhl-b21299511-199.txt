ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. 177 verbal description^ to a person previously unac- quainted with it. In order to acquire a satisfac- tory knowledge of the parts, a careful investiga- tion of thenij both in their healtl.y and diseased state, must be combined with a reference to the best plates and descriptions. It may however facilitate the progress of a beginner, to enumerate the parts as they are met with successively, in dissecting a hernia from the surface downwards. The removal of the integuments exposes the exte- rior investment of the hernial tumour continuous with the margins of the ring, and formed of ten- dinous fibres froni the aponeurosis, the cremaster muscle, &c. This is connected by cellular sub- stance to the proper hernial sac formed of the peritoneum. W hen the aponeurosis of the ex- ternal oblique has been detached from the crural arch, in the manner described in the first section of this chapter, this production of peritoneum is seen passing through the lower opening of the canal, and then continued upwards and outwards. Behind and above the ring, the inferior margin of the obliquus internus and transversus crosses the neck of the sac. When these muscles are reflected towards the linea alba, the fascia as- cending from Poupart's ligament, and forming the upper opening of the ring, is exposed, and the epigastric artery is discovered, emerging from

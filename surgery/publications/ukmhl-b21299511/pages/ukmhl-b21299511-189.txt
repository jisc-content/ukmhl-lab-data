ANATOMY OP INGUINAL RUPTURES. 167 In inguinal herniaj the parts are generally protruded directly over the spermatic chord ; at first, therefore, they penetrate the upper opening, and afterwards, having traversed the canal, make their appearance through the ring of the external obliqu^. They may enter the upper opening, and remain in the canal, without continuing their course through the lower one ; or they may come directly through the inferior aperture,with- out passing along the canal. Each of these varie- ties will require a separate description. and of the crcmaster expanding over the spermatic vessels. A careful retlexion of the muscles just mentioned, from the crural arch, will bring the fascia transversalis into view, with the passage of the chord in the space left by iis division ; and a very little dissection will expose the epigastric artery on the inner edge of the upper opening of the canal. By laying down again in i*s place the reflected portion of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, their relation to the course of the spermatic chord may be exactly ascertained j and, as the attachment of the external oblique to the pubcs still remains, the distance and relative position of the two openings may be immediately perceived. The most natural view of the supe- rior aperture may be taken from within, by carefully removing the peritoneum from the crural arch, and adjacent parts. The /ascia transversalis, with its division, may be then seen with- out any further dissection j the entrance of the spermatic vessels and vas deferens into the canal, and the course of the epigastric vessels are exposed in their most natural position j and the connexion of the fascia transversalis to the edge of the rectus is clearly seen.

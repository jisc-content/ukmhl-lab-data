TREATMENT 368 CHAP. XVI. VREi-TMENT OF THE FEMORAL RUPTURE. Reducible Femoral Hernia. A Reducible femoral rupture may be retained by a truss of nearly the same shape with that which is employed in bubonocele. The distance from the curve to the end of the pad should be rather less, on account of the different relative po- sition of the aperture. Since the instrument rests in the bend of the thigh, where it must interfere with the motions of the limb, the pad should be as narrow, from above downwards, as is consistent with the objects of the application; and it should be continued nearly in the same straight line with the spring, instead of being turned downwards. ThÂ« crural ring, from its structure and situation, is less affected by external pressure than the ab- dominal canal. An advantage will be derived from bending the under edge of the pad back- wards ; so that its convexity, instead of being

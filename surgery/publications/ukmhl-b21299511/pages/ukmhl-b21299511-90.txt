68 CeNSTRUCTrON AND L'SE closely. In order that the pressure of the in- strument should be equally distributed over the whole surface, on which it rests, it should bear equally at all points. Hence the obvious im- portance of having the spring carefully accom- modated to the shape of the pelvis. The makers of trusses should be provided with casts of the human figure for this purpose. A piece of cork is fastened to the posterior surface of the iron plate; and this is covered with leather, stufted with hair or wool, so as to give it the due firmness, and to bring it to a slight and uniform convexity. When the pad is too soft, the pressure must be insufficient; and if it is too hard, the soft parts will suffer: hence those formed of wood are particularly injurious. A French author* has proposed a bladder filled with air as a substitute for hair or wool in the pad. I know not whether this proposal has been much tried. The bladder would probably soon become flaccid, and th^ materials already mentioned answer every purpose. Various inconveniences arise from the com- mon fault of making the p^d too convex at its middle part. The elevated centre pressing strongly, while the circumference has a very glight bearing, the parts may easily escape at the * Heritz in the Jonrnal de Medicine, t. 30.

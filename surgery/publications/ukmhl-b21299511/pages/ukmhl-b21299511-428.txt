406 UMBILICAL HERNIA IN INFANTS. dencj which the parts naturally have to contract, the obliteration of the opening is hastened and assisted. When compression is employed, it is pro- duced by means of a fiat body, or of a round or oval substance adapted to the form of the open- ing. In the former case, if the bandage is applied with precision, the skin and sac, forming a fold, are pushed into the opening, and impede its obliteration by producing the same effect from without inwards, which the protruded \iscera did from within outwards. The other method ii exposed still more strongly to the same objection. By the ligature, the hernial sac and integuments ?ire removed, and there is no obstacle to the obli^ terat on of the opening. If the means of com-^ pression be not applied accurately, and kept ..uniformly in their proper situation, a portion of omentum, or bowel_, may escape, and frustrate the objec t of our attempts. Supposing the com-^ pression to succeed, both methods accomplish the closure of the navel: but, under the employment of the ligature, there is superadded to the contract tion of the aperture, an agglutination of its sides produced by the operation, and conferring a degree of solidity on the union, which can be obtained by no other process. " Experience confirms the theoretical states ipent w hich we have just given of the comparative

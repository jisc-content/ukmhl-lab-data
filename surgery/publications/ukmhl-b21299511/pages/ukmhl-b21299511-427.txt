The ligature causes a momentary pain, but is attended with no subsequent restraint; it produces in a few days what compression only effects, when it succeeds, in several months. In the one case, a constant and long-con- tinued attention is required ; if the treatment be suspended for the shortest interval, a great risk is incurred of losing the benefit prcv iously gained: in the other, on the contrary, (he object is at- tained to a certainty in spite of the cries of the child, and independently of the attention of its nurses.

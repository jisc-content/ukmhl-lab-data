44 SYMPTOMS OF A STRANGULATED RUPTURE. practitioner to decide, in similar cases, that the symptoms are not produced by the hernia; that it is not strangulated; and that the ileus arises from an internal cause. The pain is felt in the abdomen, and not in the swelling, which conti- nues soft, while the belly is inflated, hard, and tense. The attack is sudden, and not preceded by any of the occasional causes, which could af- fect the rupture; and the ring is free. The af- fection extends in the sequel to the swelling, which then becomes painful and tense: but it appears later here than in the belly, and does not proceed to so great a degree. The most embarrassing case of all^ is, where inflammation attacks the protruded parts, but is entirely independent of the rupture. The occur- rence is rare, but very possible ; since the intes- tines included in a hernia are exposed to the same causes of disease as in their natural situation. It may be expected to happen principally in large hernias: the swelling is the seat, and not the cause of the disease. The distinction must be very dif^ ficult. The want of tension, and of pain at the ring, while the swelling itself was painful; and the previous attack of feverish rigour might lead us to suspect inflammation of the protruded in- testine. If the ring afterwards became tense, and the included parts considerably painful, we should conclude that strangulation had supervened, und act accordingly.

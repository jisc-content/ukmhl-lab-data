A mode of operating has been lately proposed with the view of avoiding this danger. We are directed to make an inci* sion through the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, just above the crural arch, and in a direction parallel to that part: to introduce a director under the stricture from this opening, and to divide the tendon to the requisite extent by means of a curved knife passed along the groove*. If this plan were perfectly executed, it would undoubtedly remove all risk of injuring any of those parts, which are more or less endangered in the other ways of relieving the stricture. But it supposes a too perfect and familiar acquaintance with the anatomy of the parts, to admit of being * Edinhurgk Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. II. p. 205.

It seems that this mode of operating was first proposed by Mr. Else of St. Thomas's Hospital —Cooper,, pt. II. p. jy.

SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS 364 The swelling formed under the crural arch in the case of psoas abscess may be mistaken for a crural rupture. It is an indolent tumour, which may be made to disappear, at least partially, on pressure, and in which coughing or holding the breath gives the feeling of an impulse. As the contents of the swelling arc fluid, fluctuation may generally be perceived, and the swelling does not retire, as in the recumbent posture. As this kind of local affection is subsequent to the formation of an abscess in the neighbourhood of the psoas muscle, the preceding pain in the loins attended perhaps with shivering and other symptoms, and the absence of those intestinal affections attendant On herniae enable us to distinguish the nature of the complaint. If the surgeon should form a wrong judgment in such a case, it cannot cause any serious consequences; the progress of the abscess will speedily set him right. A varicous state of the femoral vein may be a fatal case, he adds " Eundem casum infenio quoqne obser- " vatum a CI. D. Nuck j et, quod mireris, in utroque casu " nihil exterius fuit observaiuni, quod referret herniae speciem, " nequae aegri de aliqaa in eo loco mole.stia fuerant conquesti, " adeo exigua apparet causa istius mali." Tract: 2, cap. 7. Le Quin, however, seems to have known the femoral hernia before this time. See his Iractatus de herniis in the Chirt/rgia Barbcttuntn, in the works of Barbette, by Manget, pp. 54, 55, and 74.

There can be no doubt that these appearances were caused by the pressure of a truss^ which had thus nearly effected a radical cure in a very unpromising case. I have met with an empty hernial sac, the neck of which was greatly contracted through- out, and entirely closed at one point. An oblite- ration of the cavity of the sac at its entrance, adhesions of the formerly protruded pacts at the orifice, and a thickened state both of the hernial sac, and the surrounding parts, have been found, on the examination of individuals in whom the use of the truss had effected a radical cure,* • Pare found an adhesion of the omentum to the orifice e£ the sac in a patient radically cured by a truss. Works, book 8, ch. 16. Arnaud mentions a case of epiplocele, which was cured in six or eight months. The mouth of the sac was obliterated, and the omentum, in a flattened form, adhered to it generally, Mem, de Chir. 2, 4/4. In another instance the neck was obli- terated, and fluid collected below.—Ibid, 1. 75. See also Petit, Tt. des Mai, Chir. 2. 285 5 and again at p. 377> where he thus expresses himself. " J'ai trouv6 qu' aux uns les partiei '* s'etoient rendues adherentes ^ la portion du peritoine, qui " avoit aufrefois forme le sac; qu' a d'autres, cette partie etoit " devenue epaisse, et adherernte avec les anneaux des muscle?, " avec le cordon des vaisseaux, et a tout le voisinage; que Ic tout reuni ensemble formoit un rempart impenetrable aux *' parties du ventre." Schmucker has often seen the mouth ef the sac oblite4-ated by adhesion,^C-^/r«r^i5c4^ WahnehmuTi' gen, b. 2, p. 241.

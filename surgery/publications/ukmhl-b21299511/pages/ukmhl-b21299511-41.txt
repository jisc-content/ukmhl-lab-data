RUPTURES. 19 The protrusion of the bowels, at the ring and crural arch, is favoured by the position of these points, as well as bj the comparative weakness of the parietes. The diaphragm and abdominal muscles exert a firm compression above, at the sides, and in front, and thus impel the parts downwards and forwards, against the above men- tioned opening. When the upper part of the cavitv is subjected to forcible external pressure, as by the application of tight-laced stays, the viscera are driven downwards, and the formation of an inguinal or crural rupture much facilitated. That the consequences of this practice are not imaginary, may be proved by dissection, which shews us an actual change of figure in the lower ribs, and sometimes the obvious marks of external pressure on the surface of the liver. An observation of the wide space in the ske- leton, constituting the inferior aperture of the pelvis, which forms also the lower boundary of the abdominal cavity, would lead us to expect in this situation a frequent seat of herniae. Position is here particularly favourable to its occurrence; and a forcible impulse is communicated to the hand at this part, whenever a general pressure is exerted on the abdominal viscera. This opening is filled, in the recent subject^ by the sacro-sciatic ligaments, and the levatores ani: the latter mui- c 2

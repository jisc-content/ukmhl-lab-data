All those who have taken the trouble to investi- gate carefully the structure of the parts in the natural and diseased condition, represent the fact as I have stated it above: Gimbernat, Hey, Monro, Cooper, and other modern writers, are unanimous on this point. No instance of hernia under the tfrural arch has been hitherto recorded, except at the crUral TingX The viscera descend from the abdomen at first nearly in a perpendicular direction, and come into the hollow in front of the pectineus.

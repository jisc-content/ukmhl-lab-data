2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION eighth^* or one-sixteenth of the human race is afflicted with this complaint; which afFects^ in- discriminately, persons of boOi sexes_, of everv age, condition, and mode of life. It is true, indeed, that a hernia, if properly managed, is not immediately dangerous to the patient; does not afl'ect his health, nor materially diminish his enjoyments: but it is a source of * See Ahnaud in his ])ref;ice ; his statement is adopted by GiMBEKNAT, p. 1. Mr. TuKNBULL, Surgcon to the London Rupture Society, asserts, on the authority of " the most dih- gent and general enquiries throughout the kingdom," that the proportion of the ruptured to the whole population is one in fifteen, including persons of all ages, and both sexes.—Manual, &c. Introduction, p. 10. Juville, a celebrated truss-maker in Paris, found that the number of subjects with herniae was about one-thirtieth of the population in Germany, and the North of Europe; one-fifteenth in Italy and Spain ; and one-twentieth in France and England.—Traite des Band. Hern. p. 21, 22. My readers will probably not be disposed to rely very im- plicitly on these, or any similar statements. They appear to be manifestly exaggerated. Mr. Louis ascertained the num- ber of patients with herniae in the different hospitals of Paris, We should expect to find a greater proportion here, than in mankind at large, since these very disorders compel many to seek relief at such institutions; yet it will be seen that the proportion is not so high as the quotations above make it. Of 7027 persons in the Salpetrierc, 220 were ruptured; at the Bicetre, 212 out of 3800 3 at the Invalides, 142 out of 2500, or 2000; and of the children at the Hopital de la Pitie, 21 in \0'i7-^Memoires de VAcad. de Chir. t, 5.

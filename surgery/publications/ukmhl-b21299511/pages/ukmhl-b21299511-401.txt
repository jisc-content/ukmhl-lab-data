OPCUATION FOR FEMORAL HERNIA. 379 practised by surgeons in general. The attacli- mejif of the fascia transversalis to the crural arch, and the close connexion of the hernial sac to the tendon in an old rupture must produce considerable difficulty. If the arteries run so near the crural arch as to be endangered by the other way of operating, there will be great risk of wounding them in this method; particularly if the parts should be obscured by bleeding. Lastly, the contents of the swelling would be in- evitably exposed to danger, as the extreme close- ness of the stricture does not admit of interposing any thing to guard them. I consider the best and safest method of executing this part of the operation, to be that of dividing the thin posterior border of the crural arch, in the part first recommended by Gimber- NAT i ihsLt is, as nearly as we can to its insertion in the ptib(?s. This is the very part which con- stitutes the stricture, and where a smaller division will accomplish our object, than in any other situation. Yet half an inch in all cases, and in many instances a longer space may be gained in this quarter, without affecting the main insertion of the ligament into the spine of the bone. The crural arch therefore is less weakened by a divi- sion of this, than of any other part. Strong testimony in support of these points il^^y be derived from the advice of Richter,

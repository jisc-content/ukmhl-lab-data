IRREDUCIBLE RUPTURES. 105 stant pressure on the tumour, by means of a sus- pensory bandage, made to lace in front, and di- minished in size, according as the contents of the swelling recede.* When the reduction of the tumour has been effected, it must be kept up by the application of a truss. In some instances, where the parts have been returned, the ultimate success of the plan has * When t^he size of the tumour is not very considerable. Petit advises that its reduction should be attempted by means of trusses with hollow pads : and it appears from his represen- tation, that these have been employed frequently in France with success. " Trusses designed f©r this purpose are not made with a common pad 5 but the latter part is excavated, and they are called ' bandages a cuilliere;' in others the part corresponding to the pad is a circle, triangle^ or oval of thin steel : a piece of cloth covered with chamois, and more or less tense, is sewn to the inner border of this steel, and such are called * brayers raquette.' "When Instruments of these descriptions are used, they must be tightened from day to day, as the tumour diminishes, with great caution, the local effect, and the feelings of the patient being always regarded." " It used to be stated as an axiom, that herniae with ad- hesions could be reduced only by an operation : but since the management of hollow pads has been understood by surgeons, we have reduced and kept up several of these. Confinement to bed, and a strict regimen, are necessary parts of the plan." He says that, when the intestine has passed up, in a mixed case, the omentum, if irreducible, becomes accustomed to the pressure, is diminished in size, hardened, and consoli- dated with the sac, so as to prevent future protrusion.—TV. des Mai.

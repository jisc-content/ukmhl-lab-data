The dangers of the treat- meiitj and the insuperable objcctioiTs to its adop- tion are ably pointed out by Mr. Bordenave * Of three patients who were made the subjects of experiment at one of the hospitals in Paris^ one died, one suffered a relapse^, and a third escaped with a swelling of the spermatic chord. Perfo- ration of the intestine^ and fatal gangrene of the scrotum were other consequences of this method. Such wanton trifling with the lives of men is of itself sufficient to excite our utmost indignation ; even without the aggravating circuiustance of learning that the name of De la Condamine is in the list of victims to this destructive quack*- ery.f Experience having shewn that the protrusion often re-appeared after the use of caustic, the following was proposed as a more effectual pro- ceeding. After exposing the hernial sac, it was elevated, in order to carry the actual cautery to the very bone, and produce an exfoliation. A more firm barrier against protrusion was now expected; as the cicatrix would adhere to the bone. * Meinoire sur le danger des caustiques pour la cure radicals des^ernies, in the Mem. de VJcad.

OF RUPTURES. 15 parts are found in the same tumour, it forms an entero-epiplocele. A protrusion, of the urinary bladder consti- tutes the ci/stocele, or hernia vesicas; that of the stomach, gastrocele; of the spleen, splaiocele, &c. A compound word is sometimes employed, ex- pressing both the situation and contents of the rupture; as entero-huhonocele, epiplom phalocelc, &c. So long as the viscera descend and return freely, the complaint is said to be in a reducible state. When, after long residence in the tumour, they have either increased so much in bulk, orhave contracted such adhesions to each other, or to the hernial sac, as to become incapable of being returned, although they experience no pressure from the ring, it is termed irreducible. An inca- pacity of reduction, arising from pressure exerted by the opening through which the viscera have descended, brings the disease into the strangu- lated or incarcerated state : and the part, by which that pressure is caused, is usually called the stricture.

*rnE TAXIS. 121 general character of the case is slow and languid, a judicious use of the taxis can never be inju- rious. And, although it is undoubtedly true, that the first attempt is the most likely to be successful^ and that the hope of reduction dimi- nishes as the strangulation continues, it docs not follow that other trials should be proscribed. They may be renewed, when the means employed to promote the return appear to have made any favourable change in the tumour, or in the gene- ral condition of the patient. Mr. VViLMER* of Coventry, has suggested a plan, which should be noticed in this place. He proposes to make pressure by means of a weight left on the part for several hours. It succeeded with him in two cases. A two pound l^nrl^n weight was employed in one of these, and a common smoothing iron in the other. If the swelling were free from pain, and the circum- stances not urgent, there could be no objection ta a trial of this method. * Practical Ols. on Hernice, ed. 2Tid. Case 1 and 2.

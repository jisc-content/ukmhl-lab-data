31 A REDUCIBLE RUPTURE. the inconveiiievice increases constantly with the size of the tumour. The portion of intestine or omentum, which has left the ahdomen, produces various complaints from its connexion with the parts within. From this source of irrita- tion proceed nausea and vomiting, indigestion, and colic. As the viscera become accustomed to their unnatural situation^ these symptoms gradually wear away. Still, as the tumour con- stantly increases in size, a large part of the vis- cera is deprived of that pressure and support, which it naturally derives from the respiratory muscles; the passage of the food through the alimentary canal becomes difficult and protract- ed ; and hence large ruptures are almost inva- riably attended with flatulence and constipation. The patient is precluded from all active and la- borious employments, and from all considerable exertions, which necessarily augment the tumour, and are attended with great risk of more imme- diate danger, by forcing down fresh parts, so as to cause strangulation. The opening, through which the viscera pass out, must subject them to more or less pressure; which will enable us to account for that effusion of fluid into the ca- vity of the sac, which is generally observed in old ruptures; and for the formation of those adhesions of the parts to each other, and to the hernial sac, which change the case from a

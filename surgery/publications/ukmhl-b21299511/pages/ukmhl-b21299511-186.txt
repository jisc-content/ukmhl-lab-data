164 ANATOiMY or INGUINAL RUPTURES. include the whole passage of the spermatic chord through the abdominal parietes, we must describe it as a canal, and not as a simple opening. The upper or inner aperture is rather nearer to the pubes than to the ilium*; the lower, or outer opening, is the abdominal ring ; and the canal itself extends obliquely between these points, be- ing closed in front by the aponeurosis of the ex- * It is not, perhaps, nccessaty, that the practical surgeon should be minutely acquainted with the exact measurement of the distances of these parts : yet I think it right to make one or two remarks on the subject, as some incorrect representa- tions have been given to the public. In " The Anatomy and Surgical Treatment of Inguinal and Congenital Hernia," it i& stated, that the distance from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the symphisis pubes, is six inches, and that the inner margin of the upper opening of the abdominal ring, is exactly in the mid space between them. Tiie average mea- surement between these two points, is about five inches and a half, and six inches is the greatest distance that we ever meet with; yet, in the first plate of this book, the space between the letters a, and which denote the two above-named points, is no less than six inches and a half, and in the second plate, it is actually seven inches and a half; both of which dimensions far exceed those of any human subject : these, of course, arc the errors of the draftsman. The inner opening of the ring has appeared to me to be nearer to the pubes than Mr. Cooper represents it. I subjoin the statement of the exact measures of these parts, as given by Mr. CoopiJK, in the second part of his work on hernia, lately published.

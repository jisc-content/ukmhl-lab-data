394 UMBILICAL HERNIA. lical rupture in the adult has contained intestine, unaccompanied by omentum. The transverse arch of Ihe colon, is the gut most frequently protruded in this hernia, as we might indeed have inferred a 'priori from considering the natural situation of the part in the abdominal cavity ; but the presence of the small intestine is by no means an unfrequent occurrence. A patient labouring under exoniphalos is still more subject, than in other cases of hernia, io colic, flatulence, vomiting, and the various spe- cies of intestinal derangement. Hence particular attention is required to the quantity and quality of the food, and to the preservation of the diges- tive organs in a healthy state. From the description, which I have given of the umbilicus, it will immediately appear that the contents of this rupture can become strangu- lated only by the margin of the tendinous opening in the linea alba; it is susceptible of no other species of incarceration besides that*. I shall divide the observations, which I have to make on the treatment of umbilical hernia, into three parts, according to the natural and essential distinctions in the complaint. These * The case which I quoted above from Mr. Coop-ER, of strangulation by an opening in flie sac, being a single instance, will linrdly justify us in forming an exception to this general assertion.

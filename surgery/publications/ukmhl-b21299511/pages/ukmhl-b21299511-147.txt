AFTER REDUCTION. 125 NAUD* confirm (his statement b} their own expe- rience. The difficulty of accounting for this fact, when the universal adhesion of the sac to the surrounding- parts is considered, particu- larly when the neck of the cavity is thickened; and the still greater difficulty of allowing that a large tumour, (for that of Le Dran w^as a consi- derable one,) could be thrust under the crural arch, led Mr. Louis fto consider the whole atfair as fabulous. Richter has espoused the defence of Le Dran with considerable warmth; both in a separate publication;};, and in his large work on herniiE§. I have neVer seen nor heard of such an occurrence: it seems, indeed, to me, to b« nearly impossible. At all events, it must be so extremely rare, as hardly to deserve to be taken into a general view of the subject.

ISO ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. strict m e was more than an incli higher than the external opening of the tendon. Arnaud* found a stricture two inches hehind the rinj^, and Le Dran has a similar ohservation.f Mr. HeyJ was obliged to divide the ring pretty freely in order to get at the internal stricture. In the first chapter of this work I have men- tioned that a process of thickening and induration may take place in the mouth of the sac; and I have stated further, in the fifth chapter, -that such a change will be promoted by the pressure of a truss. It cannot be doubted that the parts may experience stricture from this cause§, al- " after the opening of the external oblique muscle had been dilated, in two cases where the operation for strangulated hernise was performed during his attendance at the London " hospitals. * See his remarks " Of the Strangulation of the Intestine ly the Peritoneum, p. 353 et seq. f Ohervations, p. 60. X Practical Ohservations, p, 174. § iVIr, WiLMER says, that on passing the finger into the tendon of the external oblique, a stricture will often be found an inch higher in the neck of the hernial sac. " This stric- ture is annular, is sometimes thick and cartilaginous." Ed. 2. p. 41. Mr. Home divided the ring of the external oblique inefFec- lually; on opening the tumour, he found the intestine " closely pmbraced by the orifice of the sac."

45S HERNIA OF THE BLADDER. feeeii incommoded by an intestinal or omental hernia; and it has even been suggested tbat the former is always preceded by the latter complaint. But this is contrary to experience, which has shewn us that a protrusion of the bladder may exist alone. The manner in which an ordinary omental or intestinal rupture may become complicated by the addition of a cystocele, can be easily under- stood, when we consider that the peritoneum forming the sac was placed immediately behind the ring, and is continued over the fundus of the bladder. If the original hernia be neglected, its increase elongates the hernial sac, gradually drawing into the ring that portion of the peri- toneum, which is attached to the bladder, and the bladder itself, if it be disposed to yield to this force. Thus a portion of this organ becomes situated behind the cavity of the first rupturÂ«. The anatomical description will be just the same in this, as in the preceding ca^e. The pro- truded portion of the bladder is here interposed between the original hernia and the spermatic chord. The posterior surface of the sac, at its upper part at least, consists of the peritoneum covering the fundus and back of the bladder: and the proportion of the bag formed in this wa^' depends on the extent of the protrusion.

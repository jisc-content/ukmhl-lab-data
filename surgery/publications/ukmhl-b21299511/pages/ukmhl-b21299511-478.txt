Stones have been contained in the protruded portion in many instancesf. The symptoms of cystocele will be different, according as the protruded portion is full or empty ; confined to the groin, or continued into the scrotum ; and simple, or combined with intes- tinal or omental rupture. When the part is empty, its volume is not considerable, the sides collapse, and examination discovers nothing but a soft membranous subtance rolling under the fingers. But the most characteristic circumstances arise from the state of the urinary evacuation. When there is a frequent desire to expel the urine, with occasional retention ; when the tumour increases after retaining the water for some time, and is diminished, or entirely disappears on voiding the urine, the case must be a cystocele. The patient sometimes feels unable to expel the urine, with- out elevating apd compressing the tumour ; but struetus, ut nisi perfracto tartareo quodam casmento tenucm Btilum tiajicere possemus."

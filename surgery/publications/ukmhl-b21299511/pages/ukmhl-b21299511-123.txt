The most certain, and, indeed, the only me- thod of avoiding the formation of adhesions, is the early redu-ction and exact retention of the prolapsed parts, by means of a truss. This kind of precaution is more important in an omental hernia, for the reason above stated. In the sac of an irreducible hernia, where the passage into the abdomen must have been pre- vented by adhesions, water has been known to accumulate in such quantity as to cause pain, and other considerable symptoms, and to render an opening necessary for its evacuation.* An irreducible hernia must be left, in great measure, to itself. Its bulk and gradual increase are sources of inconvenience, and the constant possibility of strangulation exposes the patient to considerable danger. The chance of incarcera- tion is not, indeed, very great in these cases, since the ring is enlarged and weakened by its long distension, and the adhesion of the viscera, if it has occurred about the mouth of the sac, may prevent the introduction of a fresh part into * Monro; Edinburgh Medical Essaijs, vol, 5- ScHxMuc- KER 3 Vermischte Schriften, b. 2, p. 55.

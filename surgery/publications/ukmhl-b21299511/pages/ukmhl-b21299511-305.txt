283 WITH MORTIFICATION. After thus objecting to the various modes of treatment^ which have been proposed for a mor- tified intestine, it remains for me to mention the conduct which a surgeon should pursue in such a case. This is to dilate the stricture, and to leave the subsequent progress of the cure entirely to nature. The sloughs will be cast off; the ends of the gut are retained by the adhesive process in fi state of apposition to each other, the most fa- vourable for their union ; the wound contracts, and often completely closes, so that the conti- nuity of the alimentary canal is perfectly re-es- tablished. The interference of art can only be prejudicial in this process. When we consider the loose state of the intestinal canal, in its natu- ral condition, we find a difficulty in conceiving how its continuity can be restored, after consi- derable portions have perished : yet indubitable proofs of this fact exist, and induce us to place confidence in the resources of nature. In accounting for the union of the divided ends of an intestine, the fact of their being con- nected to the surrounding parts by adhesions must be borne in mind. If the ends are near each other, and placed so that their axes would form one straight line, there is no difficulty in comprehending how they may be united by gra- nulations. The circumstances are less favourable when the open extremities are more distant, and

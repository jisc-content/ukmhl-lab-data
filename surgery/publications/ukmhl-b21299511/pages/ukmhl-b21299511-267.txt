245 OMENTAL RUPTURES. is often very difficult, where an omental rupture is complicated with cirsocele, hydrocele, or en- larged testis. The most accurate examination of the parts will not always disclose the nature of the swelling under such circumstances. As the two disorders seldom begin together, a history of the progress of the tumour will much facilitate our discrimination. The danger and inconvenience of an epiplo- cele are generally less than those of an intestinal rupture, in consequence of the comparative insen- sibility of the omentum. Yet the apparently harmless nature of the complaint should not lead us to disregard it; since, besides the risk of its incarceration, it exposes the patient constantly to the occurrence of an enterocele. The connexions of the omentum to the stomach and colon are a further source of suffering, from the irritation produced by its dragging on these viscera. Hence arise in certain cases nausea, vomiting, colic, want of appetite, and painful feelings, which are often relieved by bending the trunk forwards. As a very small rupture may occasion these symptoms, a careful examination of the abdo- men is necessary in obstinate affections of the viscera. As the omentum very readily contracts adhe- sions to the sac, it is important to reduce it early, and to confine it within the abdomen by means of

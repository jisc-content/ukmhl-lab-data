A STRANGULATED RUPTURE. S3 e(l^ where a part only of the diameter of the gut is strangulated^ but it will often occur to as great a degree in that case, and will be equally insu- perable by purgative medicines,* as where a com- plete fold of intestine is included: it even hap- pens occasionally in a mere cpiplocele, where no intestine at all is protruded. Hence it must be referred rather to that inflammatory affection of the intestines, which subsists in this complaint, than to the mechanical obstruction of the canal; and must be considered as analogous to the con- stipation, which prevails in ileus when produced by other causes. The action of a clyster on the bowels below the stricture often produces a stool after the strangulation has taken place. But when these have been once emptied, the most irritating clysters produce no effect. The inflam- ■* MoRGAGNi mentions a case, in which a part only of the diameter was included, where the stools were not suppressed; yet it ended fatally; De Causis et sed. Ep. 34, Art. 15. Many instances are recorded in which the constipation has been com- plete. Memo'rres de VAcademie de CIdrurgie, torn. III. p. 15K London Med. Ohs. and Enquiries, vol. IV. p. 178 and 355.

A patient of MoRGAGNi's died on the sixth day, after con^ stipation continuing for the whole time : the entire diameter of the intestine here was unobstructed, the protruded part being merely a diverticulum.—Ep. 34.

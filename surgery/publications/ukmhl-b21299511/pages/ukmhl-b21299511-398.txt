376 OPERATION FOR FEMORAL HERNIA. ranee of this structure, in consequence of which the division of tlie fascia has led the operator to suppose that he had penetrated the true sac, and exposed the hilestine, wliile it was still covered by peritoneum. But the merely temporary con- fusion is not the worst consequence of such a mistake : it has been attended in one instance w ith a fatal termination. After cutting through the first and most superficial investment, a surgeon returned the hernial sac with its fascia propria un- opened, into the abdomen. As a free dissection was required, in order to separate it sufficiently for this purpose, the surrounding parts were left in such a manner, as, in conjunction with the neck of the sac, to continue the strangulation, and consequently to cause the patient's death*. * Coot'ER, Pt. II. pi. vii. fig. 4. A case, somewhat similar to this, came under my own observation, Ihc opera- tion for crural hernia was performed unsuccessfully on a man. WIten the abdomen was laid open, the peritoneum at the crural arch appeared distended by a considerable tumour placed between it and the abdominal muscles. The omentum was continued into a round opening with smooth sides at the centre of the swelling. The latter part was composed of a large mass of omentum, adhe ring partially to the hernial sac, and placed between the abdominal muscles and peritpneum. The cellular connexions between these had been destroyed so as to admit ot the membrane being separated to a considerable extent. Tlie hernial sac had been laid open, but its neck vvas

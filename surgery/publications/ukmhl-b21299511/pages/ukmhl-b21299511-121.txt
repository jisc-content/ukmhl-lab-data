TREATMENT OF IRREDUCIBLE RUPTURES. 99 CHAPTER VII. TREATMENT OF IRREDUCIBLE RUPTURES. The reduction of a rupture may be impracti- cable^ although the protruded parts suffer no strangulation. Increased volume of the hernial contents, preternatural connexions of the parts to each other, or to the hernial sac, and mem- branous bands of adhesion crossing the cavity of the latter, are the causes which prevent reduction in these cases. Thickening and enlargement of the mesentery and omentum are the most frequent circum- stances under the first of these heads. In irredu- cible ruptures of long standing, much of the me- sentery gradually passes into the sac: this part^ as well as the omentum, cannot increase greatly in the confined situation of the ring, but there is no obstacle to their augmentation below. The enlarged portion in the hernial sac is connected to the sound parts in the abdomen, by a compa- ratively thin process, and this conformation must ]}e a great obstacle to reduction. H 2

CONGENITAL HERNIA 436 the night; but no discharge from the bovveii took place till the following clay, when the patient was much relieved by several copious evacuations, llis recovery proceeded in the most favourable way. A single venesection with fo- mentations to the abdomen was sufficient to ob- viate a slight tendency to inflammation. A very light and sparing diet was rigorously enforced ; and no other medical assistance was required, excepting the use of the saline effervescing draughts with occasional doses of opening medi- cine. The abdomen continued perfectly soft and free from tension, except just above the wound ; here it was rather hard, and pressure excited slight pain, for which leeches were tvs ice applied with benefit. He was so completely recovered by the 2nd of October, as to bear being removed to his own home, which was several miles distant from the place where the strangulation came on. As the parts, in a case of congenital hernia, are always protruded on the outside of the epigastric artery, the stricture may be safely divided towards the ilium, as well as directly upwards.

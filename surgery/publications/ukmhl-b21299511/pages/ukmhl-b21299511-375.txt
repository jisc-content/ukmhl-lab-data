S53 OF THE FEMORAL RUPTURE. with the fascia propria; and that again with the peritoneal sac. Mr. Cooper gives the following account of the fascia propria and its origin. A thin fascia* " naturally covers the opening, through which the hernia passes, and descends on the posterior " part of the pubes. When the hernia therefore " enters the sheath, it pushes this fascia before it, so that the sac may be perfectly drawn from " its inner side, and the fascia which covers it left distinct. The fascia, which forms the crural sheath, and in which are placed the " hole or holes for the absorbent vessels, is also protruded forwards, and is united with the other, so that the two become thus consoli- dated into one. If a large hernia is examined this fascia is only found to proceed upwards, *' as far as the edge of the orifice on the inner " side of the crural sheath, by which the hernia " descends; but in a small hernia it passes into " the abdomen as far as the peritoneum, and forms a pouch, from which the hernial sac " may be withdrawn, leaving this, forming a " complete bag over the herniaf * I hayc not found this on dissection. -J- Pt. 2, p. 6 and 7. Some casual notices may be found of the structure of the sac in crural hernia. Moegagni obÂ« A a

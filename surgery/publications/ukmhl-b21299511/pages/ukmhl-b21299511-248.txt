226 OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. conduct whic h the surgeon should pursue in the case of a mortified intestine, or of diseased omen- tum will be considered under separate heads. The finger should be passed in, after the replacement, to ascertain that the ring is free, and that the viscera have completely re-entered the abdominal cavity. In an cntero-epiplocele the intestine is generally replaced first, and the omentum after- wards: if any of the mesentery should have descended, that must be returned before the intestine. A distended state of the gut sometimes forms an obstacle to reduction ; if its cavity can be emptied by gentle pressure, it will generally go up. Let not the surgeon however use vio- lence in such a case, but rather enlarge the divi- sion of the stricture. As the omentum always presents first, it generally covers the intestine from our view: hence we should unfold and carefully examine this part, as it often conceals a small portion of gut; and never cut it off until such examination has been eftectually made. Instances have occurred in which the omentum has formed a complete bag, including a portion of intestine :* in such a case it must be divided * RicHTER, Truiti dcs Hp.rnics p. 133.

OPERATION FOR FEMORAL HERNIA. 375 fer an incision in this direction to one, vyhich would cross the middle of the tumour in com- phance with the general practice; because it runs over that part of the ligament; which I propose to divide, in order to set at liberty the strangulated parts ; and thus we gain more room for executing a part of the operation which is rendered peculiarly difficult by the great depth at which the stricture is situated. With the same object of gaining room, Mr. Cooper* advises that two incisions should be made in the integuments, resembling the letter T reversed, and having their point of union in the middle of the tumour. The first of these passes perpendicularly over the upper half of the swel- ling, and is crossed at right angles by the second, which extends in a transverse direction. The angular flaps of the integuments, made by these incisions, are then to be dissected off on each side. The structure and arrangement of the cover- ings, which invest the peritoneal sac, must be borne in mind by the surgeon in executing the second part of his operation, that of laying bare the hernial contents. I have many times seen considerable embarrassment arise fron^ an igno- * ?t. ir. p.i.'i.

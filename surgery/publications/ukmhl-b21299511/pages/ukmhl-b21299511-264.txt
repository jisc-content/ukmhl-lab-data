^43 OPERATION FOR LARGE HERNIvE. is accused by this geiiileman of not understand- ing the principles on which its utility is founded^ and particularly of not knowing the very mis- chievous effects produced by the atmosphere coming in contact with the contents of any cir- cumscribed cavity. The reader will be surprised at such an accusation after he had read in Petit that the avoiding of such an exposure is the chief advantage of his inetiiod. I do not men- tion this from attaching any importance to the opinion concerning the dangerous properties of the air, but because I conceive that the French surgeon has been very unfairly treated in this business*; and I cannot help feeling a wish to clear the memory of a man, who has deserved so well of surgery, from the imputation of practising and advising what he did not understand. His sentiments on this subject will not be found inferior, either in argument or style, to those of the more modern author. * Dr. Monro supports his assertion concerning Putit's ignorance of tlie true principles, on which the utility of his operation is founded, by a quotation, which the reader must have perceived to have no connexion with the subject; and he will accordingly find that the passage in question is taken from a section of Petit's work, in which he is speaking on a point altogether different. It inust be regretted that a misre- presentation of this nature should not have been corrected in the republication of Pr. Monko"s Remarks in his son's Essay on qrural hcrqi?.

117 THE TAXIS, parts experience^ and this position can neither overcome nor diminish that obstacle. The return of a piece of intestine is generally preceded by a peculiar noise^ caused by the pas- sage of air through the strictured part. It re- cedes at first gradually, and then slips up sud- denly. The omentum goes up slowly to the very last portion, which must be actually pushed through the opening. If the taxis should not succeed at first, it may often be successfully repeated after the use of the warm bath, bleeding, or cold applications. The chance of returning a hernia will be pro- portionate to the size of the opening: hence small tumours are the most difficult of reduction, as they are always attended with the closest stric- ture; and this difficulty is experienced particu- larly in crural ruptures, from the extreme nar- rowness of the aperture through which their contents descend. The probability of replace- ment is also materially influenced by the duration of the complaint; it is much less in the later than in the earlier stages of the strangulation, from the inflammatory disorder which arises in the prolapsed parts. AVhen the rupture becomes painful, we are no longer justified in persevering in attempts at re- duction by the hand. A sufficient pressure can- not now be endured; and the force, which is

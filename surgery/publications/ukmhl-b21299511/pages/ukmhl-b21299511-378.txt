356 ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION from the neck of that part. The obturator artery is frequently produced by the epigastric, in which case it may either go on the outer side of the sac to the obturator foramen, or it may pursue its course along the inner magin. In the latter distribution the neck of the sac would be surrounded by a large vessel in three fourths of its circumference. The iliac vein is on the out- side ; the common trunk of the epigastric and the obturator vessels would lie on the front, and the obturator artery itself would be found on the inner margin of the sac. The spermatic chord and the round ligament of the uterus pass directly over the superior part of the swelling; and are not more than half an inch distant from the mouth of the sac.

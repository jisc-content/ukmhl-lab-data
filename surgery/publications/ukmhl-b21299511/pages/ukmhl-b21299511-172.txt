150 TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED RUPTURES. of the complaint: the prolapsed parts becoming more inflamed, are more closely pressed by the stricture, and soon fall into a state, where at- tempts at reduction by the hand are inadmis- sible. The danger to which the patient is exposed by the operation, is less than that which he undergoes by delay. In the latter case, inflammation and gangrene of the part, with^similar affections of the other viscera, and the highest degree of sympa- thetic constitutional irritation, are surely pro- duced by a continuance of the incarceration. In this state the operation is performed under the greatest disadvantage, as the local and general disorder both threaten a fatal termination. If * This argument has been so clearly and forcibly stated by RiCHTER, that the reader will not be displeased at my inserting the following extract from a paper of his in the Gottingen Commentaries :—" Quando mitiora remedia sediilo et dex- tere, ast incassum adhibita sunt, difFerenda non amplius est operatio. Quid enim spei superest, ut quod primo die non praestiterint, id praestent postero ? Increscit omni momento vehementia morbi, increscit vis ilia, quae constringit partes prolapsas, increscit difficultas medelse, ut itaque, quee initio morbi, ubi facilior curatu morbus erat, nil profuerunt remedia, certe sub progressu morbi jam curatu difficllioris nil prode- runt) superest hie operatio tanquam unicum rcmedium, quod, «t jam diiferatur, nil est, quod suadet, cum ab hoc solo salus expectanda sit, cum increscat omni momento periculum vitse."

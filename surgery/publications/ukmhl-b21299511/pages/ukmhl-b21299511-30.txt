GENERAL DESCRIPTIOH 8 connected by cellular substance to the proper peritoneal sac. Hence the latter part is not re- turned into the abdomen, w„hen the contents of the swelling are replaced; but remains behind, ready to receive any future protrusion. At the first moment of the occurrence of a hernia, the protruded peritoneum must of course be uncon- nected to the parts among which it lies. But adhesions take place so quickly that we find the sac universally connected to the contiguous parts, even in a rupture of a few days standing : and these connexions become afterwards so strong and general, that we might suppose the hernial sac to have been originally formed in its unnatural situation. The difficulty, which this structure would occasion, in separating the hernial sac from the surrounding parts, and particularly from the spermatic chord, constitutes an insuperable objection to any proposal for returning the sac into the abdomen, and must have been a source of great danger in some of the old methods of attempting the radical cure of ruptures. It has been ass#ted, that hernias, under cer- tain circumstances of rare occurrence, do not possess peritoneal sacs. The antients believed such cases to be very common; and supposed the protrusion to take place in consequence of an actual laceration of the peritoneum.

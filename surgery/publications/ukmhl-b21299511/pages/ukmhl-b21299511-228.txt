20'^ INCISION OF THE STRICTURE. divide the tendon upwards and outwards, when ihe spermatic chord is behind, or on the inside of the sac; upwards and inwards, when it is before, or on the outside of the hernia*. The view, which I have given of the anatomy of the parts, will shew that the artery can never be exposcni to tlie Tslightest risk, if this direction be followed. It happens, however, unfortunately, that we cannot always ascertain sufficiently the nature of the case; that the distinguishing marks of the two kinds of rupture are not laid down with sufficient accuracy, to enable practitioners in general to decide upon the subject. Nor indeed does the case seem to me to admit of such a diagnosis. A common case of scrotal hernia, in which the upper opening, from the duration of the com- plaint, has been brought opposite to the lower one, cannot be distinguished by external exa- mination from that species, in which the viscera * Although it will hold good, as a general observation, that the spermatic chord passes behind the hernial sac in the common species of inguinal rupture, and on the outer side of this part in the less frequent kind ; the vessel does not inva- riably follow these directions; I have seen it directly behind the sac in a case of the latter description ; and the varieties in its course, enumerated in Sect. II. of Chap. IX. prove satis- factorily that we cannot regulate our mode of executing this j>art of the operation by the position of the spermatic chord.

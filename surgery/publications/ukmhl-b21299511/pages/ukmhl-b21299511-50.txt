28 SYMPTOMS OF form us what are the contained parts. This dis- crimination^ indeed, is often difficult, and even impossible, when the hernia is old, large, and very tense. For the viscera in such ruptures ex- perience considerable changes in their figure and state, while the thickened hernial sac prevents an accurate examination by the hand. Again, it is frequently hard to determine the contents of a very small hernia. If the surface of the tumour be uniform; if it be elastic to the touch ; if it become tense and en- larged when the patient istroubled with wind, holds his breath, or coughs; if, in the latter case, the tu- mour feel as if it were inflated; if the part re- turn with a peculiar noise, and pass through the opening at once, the contents of the swelling arc intestine. If the tumour be compressible; if it feel flabby, and uneven on the surface; if it be free from tension, under the circumstances just enumerated; if it return without any noise, and pass up very gradually, the case may be consi- dered an epiplocele. The smooth and slippery surface of the intes- tine makes its reduction easier; and the mixture of air with the intestinal contents, causes, when they are pressed up, a peculiar guggling noise, (Gargouiileraent of the French). The reduc- tion of the omentum is more difficult, since it is soft and uneven, and its surface becomes moulded by the surrounding parts. If a portion of the

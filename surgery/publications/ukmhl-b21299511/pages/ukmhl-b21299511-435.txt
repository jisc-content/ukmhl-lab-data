UMBILICAL HERNIA IN INFANTS. 413 a bandage, which had been observed constantly since the operation. At the end of the sixth moi\th, however, this symptom had entirely dis- appeared. A girl of nine years old was brought from the country for an umbilical rupture, which had subsisted since the time of birth, Desault, whose opinion was asked on this case, advised the operation, which he had never hitherto practised at so advanced an age. It was performed with success, and the wound healed speedily: but two months afterwards the swelling began again to appear. A bandage was applied, but in spite of this the swelling in six months had become as it was originally. " The latter fact appears to contradict the experience of Celsus, who operated as late as the fourteenth year. It illustrates however the prin- ciple formerly laid down, that the disposition, ^ which the uiubilical aperture has to become closed, is lost after a certain period. In the three preceding cases the event seems to have been completely influenced by the age of the subjects. A perfect cure took place at eighteen months; it w as obtained with difficulty at four years; and a complete failure took place at nine. In several other instances, where operations have been per- formed at so late a period, the result has been the same."

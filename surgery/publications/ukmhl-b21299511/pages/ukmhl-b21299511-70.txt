48 CAUSES OF Instances of this kind are mentioned in the chap- ter on hernia congenita. I lately met with a large and old entero-epiplocele, towards the bottom of which was a round opening, with a thick and hard margin^ leading into an inferior division of the sac. The omentum had passed through thisj and become firmly adherent to the lower part; and an intestine might have been easily strangulated in the aperture. It must generally be impossible to determine the seat of stricture^ previously to an operation : and no practical advantage could be derived front ascertaining this point. We may observe^ how- ever, that when a hernia is incarcerated^ at the moment of its formation, there can be no doubt that the pressure is made by the border of the tendinous aperture; and if the patient has never worn a truss, the same observation will probably hold good. When, however, an old rupture, which has been long retained by a truss, is again protruded, and strangulated, the neck of the sac may probably be the cause, in consequence of its becoming thickened and contracted by the pres- sure. And hence arises the danger which a patient incurs by neglecting the use of a truss, after having worn it for some time. Some other rare kinds of strangulation have been noticed by surgical auXiors. It has been produced by preternatural adhesions of the parts;

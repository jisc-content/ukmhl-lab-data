CONSTRUCTION AND USE so Petit, who had ascertained these points in se- veral instajices, mentions another method in which the cure is eflfectcd ; viz. by a restoration of the membrane, forming the sac, to its natural situa- tion, so that the cavitj is effaced, and the peri- toneum lining the ring recovers its former polish and elasticity.* As trusses, when skilfully employed, often excite, without pain, "a slow inflammation, which terminates in the desirable object of obliterating the mouth of the peritoneal process, and thus effecting a radical cure; so, when placed with improper tightness, they have caused violent in- flammation and suppuration, and exposed the life of the patient to the greatest riskf. In proportion as the patient is younger, may we more reasonably expect a radical cure from the use of the truss. We may indeed speak with confidence on this point in the ruptures of chil- dren.

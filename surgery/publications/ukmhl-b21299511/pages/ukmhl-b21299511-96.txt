CONSTRUCTION AND USE 74 then it goes so near to the trochanter major as to be very easily displaced by the motions of the thigh. To avoid this defect, it has been brought midway between the crista of the ilium and the trochanter; but the same inconvenience exists in a diminished degree. A truss has been constructed by Mr. Wmit- FORD, surgeon's instrument maker, near St. Bar^ tholomew's Hospital, different from any which I have hitherto seen in the form and course of the spring, and possessing apparently all the firm- ness and stability which can be bestowed on these instruments. The spring passes on the ruptured side just below the outer edge of the crista of the ilium, as far as the posterior superior spinous process of that bone. It then goes straight across to the same point of the opposite bone, and pur- sues its course, on the sound side of the pelvis, in the same relation to the crista ilii as it held on the side of the rupture, as far as the anterior su- perior spinous process, where it terminates as usual in a leathern strap. In this mode of con- struction the motions of the trunk and thigh can- not derange the instrument, which acquires a still further stability from the extension of the spring round the sound side of the pelvis. I have not seen-enough of the actual employment of this truss to speak very decidedly on the subject. I know that it has answered the expectations of

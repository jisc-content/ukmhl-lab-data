21 RUPTURES. is naturally capacious, inguinal lierniae occur in a very large proportion, while the femoral spe- cies is very rare; females on the contrary, having the capacities of these apertures reversed, are seldom affected with inguinal ruptures. \A itli- out, however, attempting to decide what is the true reason, it may be safely asserted, that parti- cular subjects manifest an unquestionable dispo- sition to the complaint. In such persons a very slight occasional cause, such as the act of cough- ing or sneezing, will bring on a rupture; the complaint, indeed, appears sometimes spontane- ously. " I know," says Eichter,* a savant, " who leads a sedentary life, and in whom " an inguinal hernia appeared suddenly some time ago. I applied a bandage, and in a few " weeks a similar hernia came on the opposite " side; a bandage was applied to this also ; and " in a very short time a crural hernia made its *' appearance. I have seen several similar cases; " and have known four or even five herni^e come in the same subject, without the least occa- " sional cause." The necessity of admitting some original difference of structure favourable to the occurrence of ruptures, is apparent from this consideration, viz, that the openings exist in all subjects, and the occasional causes arc applied in all individuals: but the effect is only partial. * Traitt des Hernies, p. p.

INCISION OF THE STRICTURE. S04 The proximity of the epigastric artery to the mouth of the sac renders the direction of the incision a matter of considerable importance; while the various opinions concernijig- the course of the vessel have led to a corresponding <!itFe- rence in the directions for executing- this part of the operation. The practitioners of this country have generally followed the advice of Sharp* and PoTT.f who direct the knife to be carried upwards and ontwardSj i. e. towards the spine of the ilium ; and there is no danger of injuring the vessel by cutting in this direction, in the genera- lity of inguinal ruptures. But it would be en- dangered in the more rare case, where the hernia descends on the inner side of the artery ; al- though, even here the vessel is situated at such a distance from the external angle of the ring, that the return of the parts can seldom require so large an incision as to expose it to danger^. &c. all which may be seen in the 24th plate of Heister's Institutiones. These devices are so decidedly inferior to the hlunt-ended bistoury, guided by the finger, that they are novr nearly forgotten. * Critical Inquiry, p. 2g, f Worh, vol. II. p. 10(5. X That the direction of the incision towards the spine of the ilium does not necessarily endanger the epigasti ic artery, when this vessel takes its course along the outer side of the hernial sac, is satisfactorily proved by a case, which I have related in a subsequent part of this chapter.

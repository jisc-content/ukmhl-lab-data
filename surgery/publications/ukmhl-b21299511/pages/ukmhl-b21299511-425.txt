UMBILICAL HEllNIA IN INFANTS. 403 left to nature, the cure in the course of time becomes nearly impossible. The disposition, which the umbilical ring has, to close,, is gra- dually lost; so that the aperture would not become obliterated at this period, even if the protruded viscera were kept in the reduced state. Hence we perceive that there is a very essential difference in the nature of the umbilical rupture, as it occurs in the infant or the adult; and that this distinction is derived from the tendency to contraction in the tendinous ring. In the former case a radical cure is easily obtained; in the latter it is nearly impossible. In the one instance it is suff^icient to keep the viscera within the abdomen, and the ring will contract of itself. In the other the opening remains, whether it be occupied by protruded viscera or not. Hence also it follows, that practical observations, drawn from one form of the complaint, cannot be ap- plied to the other. In treating that species of exomphalos, which we are now considering, our object is to obtain a radical cure. By returning the protruded parls^ and keeping them reduced, the umbilical rhig will contract, and become obliterated, so as to prevent any future protrusion. There are two methods by which this may be attempted, viz. compression, by means of bandages; and the D d

That part of it which is fixed to the spine of the bone, has the appearance of a firm and some^Yhat round tendinous chord ; its insertion into the crista of thepubcsis effected by means of a thinner portion, which gives to the tendon a clearly defined sharp edge at its posterior margin. The latter division of the tendon must of course be situated much more deeply from the surface than the former. Its sharp wiry edge can be felt very distinctly by passing the finger under the crural arch, on the inner side of the femoral vein, either from above or below. If we describe a distinct part under the name of Poupart's ligament, we should state, that when it approaches to the bone, it becomes suddenly broader; that it is fixed by this broad portion along the whole length of the spine and crista of the pubes; that it has a rounded and strong an- terior edge, a thin and sharp posterior margin, and that the former of these is nearer to the sur- face, while the latter is comparatively deeply seated. The breadth of this part varies in different subjects: it is generally from three quarters of an inch to an inch. Sometimes, as

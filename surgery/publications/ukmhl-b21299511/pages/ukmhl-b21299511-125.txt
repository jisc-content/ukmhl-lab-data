Such was the case of the celebrated Zimmermann.* The omentum adhered by a single filament to the testicle : when the former was replaced, the latter ascended with it, and experienced very painful pressure from the ring : if the parts were allow^ to protrude again, a portion of intestine gene- rally folloNvedj was pressed on by the ring, and occasioned a fear of strangulation. The pressure of atruss occasioned such severe sufi'eringthat it could not be borne. In a patient, on whom Mr. Aber- TSETHvf operated, an adherent epiplocele gave rise to frequent protrusions of the intestine,which were highlj'distressing. In both these cases there existed a particular source of danger and incon- venience., which admitted of no remedy but the operation.

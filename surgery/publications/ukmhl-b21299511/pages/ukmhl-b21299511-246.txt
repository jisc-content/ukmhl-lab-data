224: OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. St. Bartholomew's hospital, \vi<h a strangulated bubonocele, on the niornuig of the 14th of Janu- ary, 1807. The incarceration had taken place on the preceding evening at ten o'clock. Cold applications, continued for the space of four hours, and, combined with the repeated use of tobacco clysters, having proved ineffectual, the operation was performed by Sir C. Bliâ‚¬KE at twelve o'clock. The case proved to be an intes- tinal rupture; and the strictured bowel for the length of two inches was, in the whole of its dia- meter, of the darkest brown and almost black colour: this portion was distinguished from the sound gut by a defined line. It was returned into the abdomen ; but the depth and extent of the discolouration were considered as such unfa- vourable circumstances, that the patient was not f ex\\ecU\d to survive. Symptoms of enteritis hav- ing appeared >vithin a few hours from the opera- tion, sixteen ounces of blood were taken from the temporal artery ;* and tlic bleeding was repeated soon after to the same amount. With this evacuation were combined the use of warm fomentations to the abdomen, the internal exhi- bition of a solution of magnesia vitriolata and * The blood was drawn from this vessel, in consequence of the superficial veins of the arm being so unusually small, that, although they were opened in several places on both sides, no blood flowed from them.

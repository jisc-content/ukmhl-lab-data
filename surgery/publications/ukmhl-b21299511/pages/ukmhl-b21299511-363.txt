OF THE FEMORAL RUPTURE. 341 The latter is united, externally to the vessels^ to the sheath, including the sartorius. The covering of the vein, on the inside, or concavity of the semi-lunar edge, has been just mentioned. Along the whole of the bend of the thigh, a thin and irregular fascia, or condensed cellular texture intervenes between the parts now de- scribed and the integuments. This covers the upper part of the fascia lata, the crural arch, and the lower portion of the aponeurosis of the obli- quus externus. It contains different layers inter- mixed with the absorbent glands of the lower extremity, and with the superficial veins which join the trunk of the saphena*. The crural arch, and the adjacent tendinous expansions, are a complex subject, of which description alone will almost inevitably lead the student to form erroneous notionsf. The dift'erent parts of this structure must be designated by par- * Tins fascia is described by Camper, Jcones Hern. p. 11. Mr. Cooper calls it the superficial fascia. f These parts should be dissected both from before and behind. In the former case, after removing the integuments, the superficial fascia, with the absorbent glands, and some cutaneous veins are brought into view. When these are dis- sected away, we see the attachment of the fascia lata to the crural arch; the termination of this portion in the lunated edge, over the femoral vein 5 its continuity behind the sa- phena, by a second semi-lunar edge, with the pectineal por- tion of the fascia j the insertion of the latter into theptibes,

OF TRUSSES. requires a proportionally stronger spring than an intestinal rupture. When the hernia is large and old, or the subject of it is exposed to the necessity of frequent laborious exertions, a strong truss is required. The patient should on no ac* count wear a more powerful spring than his rup- ture requires, since the long-continued pressure of the pad must have tfie effect of weakening and injuring the abdominal ring and surrounding parts. When the case requires so strong a spring, that the pressure on the spermatic chord is painful, the pad may be constructed with a hollow to admit this part. A similar contrivance may be found useful when rupture is combined with dis- ease of the testis or spermatic chord. In cases where an enlargement of the latter part has rendered it impossible to keep up rup- tures by the common instruments,pad, having a projection in its middle, just sufficient to fill up the opening, has been employed with success * The form of the spring, and consequently the position which it occupies at the side of the pel- vis, is a point of the greatest importance in ob- viating the possibility of a derangement from the motions of the trunk or hip. Sometimes it is carried horizontally round from the pad; and * Gooch's JForkSfYol. 2,^,221.

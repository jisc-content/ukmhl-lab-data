The use of pur- gatives and clysters, which are beneficial m the latter, do not afford a chance of success in cases of the former description. They should never be employed, unless the slow progress of the case clearly shews that the danger is not urgent. I wish to impress the surgeon with the pro- priety of giving, without delay, an adequate trial to the most powerful means which the art affords, and of performing the operation as soon as it can be clearly perceived that these are un- successfuF. There is no reason to expect that a less active remedy will succeed, when a more potent one has failed.

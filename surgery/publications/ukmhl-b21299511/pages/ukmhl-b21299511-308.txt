TREATMENT OF RUPTURES 286 part; this will promote the evacuation of the ali- mentary canal, and afford considerable relief.

CASE I, As T was travelling post in Germany, I went, while the horses were being changed, into a room, where I perceived an insupportable stench, which I immediately recognized, although it was ming- led with several others no less disagreeable. It was a smell of putrefaction or gangrene that I particularly distinguished : and, on enquiring the cause, a female attendant led me to the bedside of an apparently dying man. The groin and scrotum were in a state of gangrene, and perfo- rated by several openings, giving issue to feces mixed with bile, and containing white clots^ which consisted of curdled milk:â€”forming a tout ensemble highly offensive both to the sight and smell. Having removed the filth, cut away the sphacelated skin and membranes, and dis- covered the spot at which the intestine had given way, I procured, by the introduction of a canula, the discharge of much liquid bilious matter, from the intestine above the stricture.

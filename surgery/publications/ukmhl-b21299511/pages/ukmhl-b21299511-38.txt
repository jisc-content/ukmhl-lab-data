CAUSES 16 CHAPTER II. CAUSES OF RUPTURES. T^HE causes of these complaints may be re- ferred in general to two divisions^ according ai they appear to operate by increasing the pressure of the viscera, or by diminishing the resistance of the abdominal parietes. The former may be ranked^ in a systematic arrangement of the sub- ject, as om/.sfowaZ or exciting; the latter as disposing causes of the complaint. Alternate contractions of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles are among the chief agents in the important function of respiration. The con- taining and contained parts are in a constant state of action and reaction: the latter, particularly the intestines, tending constantly to occupy a larger space^ and thereby distending the parietes; while the former, consisting chiefly of muscles, exert a compressive force on the viscera. These powders are ordinarily in equilibrio ; and the con- stant pressure arising from this source maintains the viscera in their relative position; but their balance is destroyed under various circumstances.

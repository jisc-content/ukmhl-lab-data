382 OPERATION FOR FEMORAL RUPTURE. know of nonc^ which avoids the vessel more cer- tainly, whihj in faciliij of execution^ and in other advantages, this has the undoubted prefeience. A calculation of the proportionate number of instances, in which we mjij expect to find the obturator artery running along the inner side of the neck of the sac, will much diminish aur ap- prehensions concerning the danger of this vessel. Dr. Monro has found the obturator artery to arise from the trunk of the epigastric once in twenty-five or thirty subjects; I should think this unusual origin must occur as often as <«ice in ten instances; yet, where the source of the vessel thus deviates from the accustomed de- scription, it generally takes its course along the outside of the hernial sac, and conse- quently is exposed to no danger*. The compa- rative number of instances, in which it is found on the opposite side, cannot be stated higher than one in eight or ten. It would therefore be en- dangered only once in eighty or one hundred operations. And, if we consider, that by tb^ caution of introducing <he knife to the very smallest distance within the stricture, that is * '< In all cases (snys Mr. Cooper) which I have myself " dissected, where this variety existed with crural hernia, tlie " obturator has passed into the pelvis on the outer side of the " neck of the sac, entirdy out of the reach of any danger of " the knife,"—Pt.

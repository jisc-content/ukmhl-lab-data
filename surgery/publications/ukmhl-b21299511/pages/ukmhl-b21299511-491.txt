VAGINAL RUPTURE. 469 passage, by which the contents of the swelling de- scend, is of considerable length, consequently that a portion of intestine may be contained in it, al- though the obvious tumour be reduced. Hence we should press on the surface of the vagitia as far as the os uteri, so as to remove whatevermight be contained in the neck of the sac. When com- plete reduction has thus been accomplished, future protrusion must be prevented by the use of a pessary. Since this object cannot be obtain- ed without distending the sides of the vagina, pes- saries of the common form are not sufficient. The globe-shaped instrument has been found to answer; but the hollow cylinder is the most suit- able. If anj' difficulty should be experienced in the reduction, the recumbent position, and the use of clysters would probably be sufficient to overcome it. But the most serious inconvenience would arise from the rupture protruding duriiig partu- rition; and this consideration should lead us to adopt every measure which can obviate such an occurrence. Pressure should be made on the opening during the pains, until the head has de- scended into the pelvis ; or, if the tumour is down, it should be pushed back into the abdomen, by introducing the hand into the vagina* ; but Smellie's Cases, p. 148.

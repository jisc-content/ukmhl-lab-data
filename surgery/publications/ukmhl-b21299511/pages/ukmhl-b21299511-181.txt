ANATOMY OF INGCINAL RUPTURES. 159 is attached to the spine and crista of the bone. The separation of these tendinous columns leaves a triangular space^ called the abdominal ring, or ring of the external oblique muscle. The os pubis constitutes the base of the triangle; the two pillars form its sides; and the apex is the part at which these separate from each other. It is not, however pointed; since some transverse fibres, which connect the two columns together^, round oft* this upper part of the opening: these are found particularly strong in an old hernia. The abdominal ring is directed obliquelj' up- wards and outwards; the upper part of it point- ing towards the spine of the ilium: this part is often mentioned by the name of the external angle of the ring. The base of the triangle is situated downwards and inwards with respect to the apex; and the two sides, of which one is external and the other internal, are continued from the apex obliquely downwards and inwards to the basis.* ^ The aponeurosis of the internal oblique mus- cle is separated through its greater part into two layers, of which the anterior -and thicker joins * If we employ the new terras of Dr. Barclay, the apex of tbe ring is atlanto-lateral 3 the basis sacro-mesial, the internal side is mesial, and the external lateral j the atlantal ends of these two sides are lateral, and their sacral ends mesial.

The pressure of the tumour occasions a considerable thickening' of this part in old herniae, where several distinct layers may often be recog- nized ; and the thickness of the sac, taken alto- gether, depends on this circumstance. The ex- ternal pudic vessels are distributed about the sac and integuments, and their branches acquire a considerable size in old scrotal ruptures*. Surgeons in general have not been aware of the existence of the external covering now de- scribed. They have supposed the hernial sac to consist merely of peritoneum in various states of density: and represent the thickened state, in which it is frequently found, to arise from dis- tension. Yet some writers have understood the real nature of the case. MERvf found three coverings over the sac in a very large hernia; and PetitJ, in describing the operation, speaks of exposing and dividing the membranes common to the hernia, with the spermatic chord and tes- ticle." The peritoneal sac, according to Mau- CHART§, is surrounded by a thicker external coai, * Camper, tab, 13. t Mem, de Vj^cad. des Scierices. 1701. " Observations sur les Hernics."

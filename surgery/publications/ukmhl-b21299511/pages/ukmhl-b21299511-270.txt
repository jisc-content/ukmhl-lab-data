OMENTAL RUPTURES. 248 tent, that its state has been described by the epi- thets " scirrhous*" and " cancerousf." To return a portion of omentum, when dis- eased in the manner which we have now described, would be a very bad practice, for two reasons. It would often require so large an incision of the ring, as to weaken the parts considerably, and thereby increase the chance of a future protru- sion. The presence of such a diseased mass in the abdomen would also excite inflammation in the surrounding' parts, and thereby bring the patient into a state of danger, not less than that from which the operation had relieved him. This at least was the event in a case recorded by ?Â»Tr. Hey;]; : the subsequent symptoms and the dissec- tion clearly shewed that the patient's death arose from inflammation excited by the replacement of a diseased mass of omentum. In another case, recorded by the same surgeon^, a diseased por- tion of this membrane, which had been returned into the abdomen, was found upon dissection completely mortified; and would probably have caused the ] at'ent's death, even if the returned intestines had not become gangrenous.

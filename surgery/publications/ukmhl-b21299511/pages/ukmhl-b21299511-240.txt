21S OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. * Traite des Hernies, p, 118. method. The incision in the sac, being more remote from the peritoneum^ will be less likelv to excite inflaniuiation in that membrane; and if the epigastric artery should be wounded, it will not bleed into the abdomen. An accurate com- parative trial of both methods would be neces- sary in order to determine the weight of the first reason. The second circumstance cannot be a matter of any importance, if we cut in such a direction as to avoid the risk of wounding the artery. Many circumstances present themselves as objections to this proposal. The manoeuvre it- self, although perhaps easy to the experienced band of such an able anatomist as Mr. Cooper, would, I am convinced, be found highly difficult, if not impracticable, by the generality of sur- geons. This difficulty arises from the firm man- ner in which the sac and surrounding parts are connected, we might almost say, consolidated to each other. The experience of Richter* shews that this objection is founded in reality. Hef once tried to divide the ring, without cutting the sac, but he found it impracticable. If the stric- ture is so tight, as to prevent the introduction of the finger, there must be great danger of wound- ing the protruded parts.

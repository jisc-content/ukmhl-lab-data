UMPILICAL HERNIA IN INFANTS. 411 umbilical opening, should be retarded by the pressure of the viscera ag;ainst the parts. " We could recount a multitude of cases, in which the practice above detailed is confirmed by experience. But several have already been pub- lished ill the Surgical Journal*, and an addition to their number would only lengthen these re- marks unnecessarily. It is sufficient to state, that since the publication just alluded to, Desault has performed the operation in a vast number of instances with uniform success. Children were brought to him every week at the public theatre where he lectured, and had the ligature applied in the presence of the students; they were then taken home, and brought back daily to be dressed until the cure was complete. " It may still be doubted, says Sabatier, in quoting an article from the Parisian Journal, where Desault speaks on this subject, whether the children have been radically cured : the her- nia may have returned at some future period. A multitude of facts may be adduced to dispel this suspicion: several patients were brought to the public consultation of Desault for other com- plaints, long after the period of the operation, and were found on examination to have the um- bilical opening completely obliterated, and to be free from the slightest impulse of the viscera * There is an account of" nine cases treated in this manner in the Parisian Ckirurgical Journal^ vol.

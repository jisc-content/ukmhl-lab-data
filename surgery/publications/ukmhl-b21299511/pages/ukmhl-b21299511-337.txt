315 ARTIFICIAL ANUS. CASE V*. After tlie removal of a portion of colon^ in a case of hernia with mortification, an artificial anus remained, through which all the feces were discharged^ excepting some whitish hardened portions, which are still expelled every two or three months. At the end of about eight weeks, the intestine protruded through the wound, arid a second protrusion appeared in a few dajs. Thej were two or three inches in length, and fifteen or sixteen in diameter ; and have remained of the same size. Their colour is a deep red, and the surface irregular. They can be easily replaced, without any pain, but the slightest effort is sufficient to renew the protrusion, parti- cularly in the erect position. Clysters injected per anum pass out immediately through the portion which projects from the lower extre- mity; and vice-versa. Messrs, Sabatier, de LA Martiniere, and Andouille, to whom this person was referred for the purpose] of ascertaining whether a cure could be accom- plished, advised him to be contented with pal- Jiative measures. He wears a truss with a pad. * See the memoir of Sabatier already quoted; p. 6l8,

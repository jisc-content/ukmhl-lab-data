9^ RADICAL CURE had arisen from violent exertion, or in a young subject; but in an old rupture, an old subject, or where the marks of predisposition are strong, there could be no hope. If the mere absence of an opening were sufficient to prevent hernia, the complaint would never occur ; as the membrane is entire previous to protrusion. When the ring has been dilated by the descent of the viscera, we should be quite unreasonable in expecting the mere closing of the sac to form a sufficient obsta- cle to a fresh protrusion. The insufficiency of the methods is tacitly acknowledged by the re- commendation of wearing a bandage for some time afterwards. We find that the hernia; often appeared again in those who had undergone the operation*; and we know that a renewal of the protrusion is so frequent after the ordinary ope- ration for incarcerated hernia, that the use of a truss is universally adopted, as a means of preven- tion. Since then the cause of the complaint, the enlarged state of the tendinous opening, is not removed by the processes adopted for a radical cure; gince a recurrence of the disorder is not prevented, wc may assert without hesitation that * AcREL operated in several cases of reducible hernia; â€¢ome were radically cured, while the complaint returned others.

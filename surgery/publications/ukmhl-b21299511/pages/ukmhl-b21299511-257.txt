OPERATION FOR LARGE HERNLE. 235 proceeding. I have already noticed the proposal of RicHTER ; that of scarifying the neck of the sac, in order to produce adhesion of its sides*. He seems to have found this successful in prac- tice; and its performance cannot apparently be attended with the risk of any unfavourable con- sequence. One remark may be made on all these methods; viz. that they cannot operate on the cause of the complaint. The frequent return of ruptures after the operation must be ascribed chiefly to the dimensions of the ring being en- larged by the incision. This state of the parts will not be at all affected by the obliteration of the mouth of the sac.

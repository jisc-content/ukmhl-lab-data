SYMPTOMS OF INGUINAL RUPTURES, 195 described above, as belongiug to a rupture^ exist at the same time. A hydrocele sometimes extends along the chord as high as the ring, the swelling at the same time beino: so tense that no fluctuation can be perceived. The origin of the tumour below, and its gradual ascent; its being constantly of the same size; and the impossibility of distinguish- ing the testicle, shew that the case is a hydrocele. But, in a congenital rupture, the testis cannot be distinguished, as it is enclosed in the same bag with the protruded viscera. Here the continua- tion of the swelling into the ring, the variations in the size of the tumour, according to the posi- tion of the patient's body, its origin from above, and the impulse occasioned by coughing, will point out the existence of a protrusion. If the swelling has commenced below, and is invariable in its size ; and if no impulse is felt on coughing, it is a hydrocele. Rare instances have been ob- served, in which fluid was collected in the cells of the spermatic chord ; and they have been de- signated by the name of hydrocele of the sper- matic chord. Here the swelling extends into the ring, and the position of the body affects its bulk, which may be partly diminished by pressure towards the ring. The origin of the tumour below leads to the distinction. If it had beea â€¢

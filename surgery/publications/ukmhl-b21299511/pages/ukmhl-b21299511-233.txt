INCISION OF THE STRICTURE. 211 quarters of an inch from its origin. It did not appear that the smallest quantity of blood had escaped from the divided vessel. Within the ahdomettj and just behind the ring, there was a small piece of intestine perfectly black and gan- grenous, which had been strangulated by a pre- ternatural band of adhesion, extending from the peritoneum, close to the ring, to the mesentery. The convolutions of the small intestine, exceed- ingly distended (to two and three inches diameter) seemed to fill the whole abdomen. They were slightly agglutinated to each other, and marked here and there with red streaks. The lower ex- tremity of the testis lay just in the upper opening of the ring*. * The state of Ihe testis in the present case leads to some interesting remarks. The body of the gland was not more than half its usual size : the epididymis, which was very im- perfect, ran for about an inch behind the hernial sac, and did not join the body of the testis. Another case of hernia, which I had the opportunity of examining through the kindness of my friend Mr. Crowther, presented the same appearances, viz. an imperfect body of the testis just witliin the ring, and an incomplete epididymis, which ran down behind the hernial sac. Both the preparations are preserved iu the museum of St. Bartholomew's hospital. These cases corroborate the opinion of Mr. Hunter concerning the cause of the testicles not quitting the abdomen.

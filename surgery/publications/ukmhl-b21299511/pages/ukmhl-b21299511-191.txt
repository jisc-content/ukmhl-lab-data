ANATOMY OF INCxUINAL RUPTURES. 169 the production of peritoneum, escaping through the lower opening of the canal is continued di- rectly downwards. When the hernia is first formed, the distance between the two openings and their relative po- sition are the same as in the natural state. But the pressure of the protruded viscera, by enlarg- ing the superior aperture, gradually brings it nearer and nearer to the inferior; so that in an old and large rupture, the opening into the ab- domen is almost direct. The effect of this pro- cess is such, in all cases, that we seldom meet with an instance, in which the rupture has passed the tendon of the external oblique, where the natural distance between the two openings is preserved. The peritoneum, being protruded directly over the spermatic vessels, passes between these and the cremaster muscle. The latter part, together with a condensed cellular substance, forms a coveririg, which envelops the chord, and the testis with its membranes, and is described by some anatomists/as the tunica vaginalis of the spermatic / V ^^â€¢'^^^^ chord. The hernia is placed between this and the spermatic vessels ; the sac is consequently pro- vided with an exterior investment from this source; and the covering is common to it with the chord and testis.

ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. 161 which we are now describing, consists of * verj thin and delicate expansion. Mr, Cooper, who first noticed it, and who has bestowed on it the name faiicia transversalis, has rightly observed, that in some subjects it appears only as conden- sed cellular membrane.* If, after carefully re- moving the transversus, we press with the finger above Poupart's ligament, we shall experience a greater resistance than the unsupported perito- neum could ofier; and this arises from the fascia in question. Yet it often has a very distinct tendinous ftructure near the front of its attachment to the prural arch. If we trace it from this part up- wards, we ihall find it divided immediately into two portions, an internal and external; which leave between them a considerable interval, just in the middle of the crural arch. The former of these is connected by its inner edge to the outer margin of the rectus abdominis, and to the infe- *' cctte fcnte uniquement remplie par du Tissu cellulaire ct *' par les parties mentionnees est place le Peritoine, qui n'est *' rccouvert par aucun muscle, et qui doit non seulement ** reslster ^ la force distendante, mais encore au poids des visceres de Tabdomen.

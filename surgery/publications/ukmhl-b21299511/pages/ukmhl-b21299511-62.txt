SYxMPTOMS OF 40 ascertain whether the parts could be replacca previously to the attack ; if they could not, and the swelling be large and old, they are probably adherent; and the impossibility of reduction proves nothing. If they could be returned, and particularly a short time only before the access of the symptoms, strangulation may be suspected with justice; but it is still not quite certain. The two following cases, related by Mr. Pott,* shew the possibility of mistake, and will forcibly inculcate the necessity of a minute attention to the circumstances. CASE I. An old gentleman, who had for many years had an irreturnable rupture of the mixed kind, and which I had often seen, was seized with the symptoms of an obstruction in the hitestinal canal. He complained of great pain in his whole belly, but particularly about his navel; he was hot and restless, and had a frequent inclination to vomit; his pulse was full, hard, and frequent; and he had gone, contrary to his usual custom, three days without a stool.

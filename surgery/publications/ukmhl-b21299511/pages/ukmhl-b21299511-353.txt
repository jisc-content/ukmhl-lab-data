OF THE FEMORAL RUPTURE. 331 edge of the bone is thick and level, extending inwards for about half an inch, and terminated by the symphysis. The point, at which this levÂ«l horizontal part is continuous with the perpendi- cular line of the sympliysis is the onglc of the pubes. To the superior spine are attached the fascia of the thigh, the tensor vaginae, the sartorius, the crural arch, and the iliacus internus; and to the inferior, one of the tendons of the rectus cruris. The notches c and e are filled by the iliacus in- ternus and psoas magnus, and are continuous behind with the concave or pelvic surface of the ilium. The gentle excavation g is of particular importance. Its surface is smooth, broadest at the acetabulum, and growing narrower towards the spine of the bone; terminated in front by a prominent line, rising over the notch which con- tains the obturator vessels, and giving attach- ment to the pectineus, and behind by a sharp and rough ridge, extended backwards and outwards from the spine, and called the crista of the pubes*. On this excavation the crural vessels are placed. The crista is continuous behind with the obtuse * This together with the following line, forms the linea ileo-peclivea of Mr. Cooper. The surface of the bone, at this part, as well as in the smoolh hollow which receives the femo- ral vessels, is covered by a thick and closely adhering ligamen- tous substance, called by Mr. Coon a ligament of thepuhes.

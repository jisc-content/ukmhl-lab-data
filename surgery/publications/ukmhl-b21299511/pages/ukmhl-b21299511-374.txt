352 ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION integuments and cellular substance are carefully removed from a femoral rupture, \\e shall find that it lies on that portion of the fascia which, covering the pectineus, is inserted into the front edge of the pubes; and that;, as it comes over the margin of the bone, to which the fascia is fixed, it must necessarily be placed on the ante- rior surface of that part. The variety of crural hernia*, in which the parts are contained within the sheath of the crural vessels, must be excepted from these observations. The swelling in that case is co- vered by the fascia lata; is consequently more obscure to the feel; and has not a defined edge. The peritoneal sac of the rupture is covered by an exterior investment, named bv Mr. Cooper the fascia propria. This is generally thicker than the peritoneum, close and firm in its texturcj and embraces the whole of the tumour, to the very neck. More or less adipous substance is interposed between it and the peritoneal covering of the rupture. Since the parts descend on the inner side of the vein, I am disposed to refer the origin of this fascia propria to the condensed fibrous substance, which completes the crural sheath on its inner or mesial side. The super- ficial covering is often consolidated at some parts *â–  CoopiiR, pt 2, p. 20, plate 8, fig. l.

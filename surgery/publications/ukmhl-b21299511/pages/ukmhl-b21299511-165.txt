This may be accom- plished by pounded ice, tied up in a bladder, and placed on the rupture. A solution of sal ammoniac, or of other salts, in cold water, may be employed in the same manner. The applica- tion of folded cloths dipped in iced water, and frequently renewed; and the evaporation of etherf upon the part, are other means of accom- plishing the same object. We should persist in the trial for some hours;];, iu order to give it a fair chance: yet caution must be observed on the palient placed on a blanket, and ordered a bucket of cold well water to be dashed on the thighs and abdomen; and the hernia returned almost immediately.â€”Tr. cids Mai, Chir, t. 2, p. 325. * Mr. WiLMER has been very strenuous in recommending fhis practice, and has related several cases of its successful employment.

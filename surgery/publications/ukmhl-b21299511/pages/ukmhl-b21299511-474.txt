HERNIA OF THE BLADDER. terior half closely adheres. The omentum or intestines may easily descend into this pouch; and thus an omental or intestinal rupture will be superadded to the hernia of the bladder. It has not been ascertained whether these protrusions occur in the course of the abdominal canal, or come directly through the opening in the apo- neurosis of the obliquus externus. If the si- tuation of the upper opening be compared with that of the bladder, it would seem very difficult for a cystocele to take place at that aperture; while its occurrence at the lower opening can be very readily conceived. It was noticed in one case that the spermatic vessels were on the exterior side of the hernia.* When the protruded part descends into the scrotum, it will probably lie in front of the spermatic chord; even al- though the latter part should have been placed exteriorly to the swelling at the r^ig. As a cystocele may give rise, in the manner already described, to a protrusion of intestine or omentum, so an enterocele or epiplocele may cause a descent of the bladder. The symptoms of the latter occurrence have not been observed in many instances until long after the patients had * Keate's cases of the hydrocele, {ffc. to which is sul" joined a singular case hernia vesica: urinarite, isfc. 8vo, London, 1/78.

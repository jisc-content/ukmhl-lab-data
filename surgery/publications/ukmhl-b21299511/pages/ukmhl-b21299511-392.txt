TREATMENT OP 370 where a complete fold of intestine had been en- gaged, the opening, after removing the gut, would not admit a full-sized bougie, without considerable pressure. These circumstances will lead us to expect, as we actually find to be the case, that the femoral hernia easily becomes strangulated; that the closeness of the stricture diminishes the chance of reduction by any means but the operation; and that the great pressure, which the parts experience, must render delay Tcry dangerous. I think it right to insist more particularly on these points, because Mr. Pott has represented them in a directly opposite light. He states that the femoral rupture seldom becomes strangu- lated ; that the contents may generally be returned m the operation without any incision of the stric- iure, on account of the " large space between the OS ilion and os pubis, and that that space " is occupied principally by cellular membrane " and fat*.'* The anatomical incorrectness of this representation will be detected by the most inexperienced student. I am authorized in stating that the surgical inferences are equally false by having seen the operation performed in twelve iljstances, and having had several opportunities * H'orks, vol. II. p. 138. I

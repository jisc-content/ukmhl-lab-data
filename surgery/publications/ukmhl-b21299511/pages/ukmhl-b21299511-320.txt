ARTIFICIAL ANUS. 298 evacuation of the feces; and the entire cessation of its functions produces no material ill conse- quence. Hence the prospect of recovery, when the continuity of the intestine cannot be restored, depends entirely on the situation of the unnatural opening; is greater in proportion as that is nearer ( to the inferior end of the canal, and smaller as it approximates to the stomach. The sides of the aperture in the intestine be- come consolidated to the circumference of the opening in the abdominal parietes, and the cica- trix renders this union very firm. Thus the most effectual barrier is opposed to the effusion of the intestinal contents into the abdomen. If the wound could be closed, by the approximation of its sides, the deficiency in the intestinal tube would be supplied, and its contents would then pass on in their regular channel as before, unless the two ends were united at such an anHe as to produce a mechanical obstacle. (Seethe observa- tions on this subject in the preceding section^ p. 284). Hence the essential circumstances of the case consist in an unnatural fistulous opening aflbrding a ready discharge to the intestinal contents ; and in an obstacle, which prevents them from taking their ordinary course. The contraction of the tube below the new anus, where it is no longer distended as in its natural state, is a consequence of the complaint favourable to its continuance.

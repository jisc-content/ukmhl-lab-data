CONGENITAL HERNIA tunica albuginca. The hernial sac is formed therefore by the vaginal coat of the testicle. The differences between a congenital and an ordinary scrotal rupture are, it must be con- fessed, less important in practice than in patho- logy ; for the symptoms and treatment are very nearly the same in both species. The fact of the viscera being occasionally found in contact with the testicle, was observed by surgeons long before the circumstances, lead- ing to this peculiar modification of the complaint, liad been investigated and explained. As the sac of the scrotal hernia lies in close contact with the tunica vaginalis, the older practitioners supposed that the pressure of the protruded parts might cause a preternatural communication between the two cavities ; and thus they attempted to account for the phenomenon in question. The true nature of the complaint was ascertained about the middle of the last century; when the labours of several celebrated surgeons and physiologists threw much light on the whole subject*.

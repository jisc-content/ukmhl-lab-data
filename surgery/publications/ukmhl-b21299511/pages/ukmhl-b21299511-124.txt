102 TREATMENT OF the opening. Yet experience proves that stran- gulation may occur, and that these swellings be- come gradually larger. For these reasons, it has been proposed to open the sac, to destroy the ad- hesions, return the parts, and thereby produce a radical cure. But, if this proceeding be not admissible in a case of reducible rupture, it is opposed by much stronger arguments, under the circumstances we are now considering. The danger of the opera- tion is infinitely greater, as a very large surface is exposed, and the adherent parts separated by the knife in a long and difficult dissection, must also go through the processes of inflammation and suppuration. Let it be further considered that the parts contained in a large and old hernia, cannot always be kept up in the abdomen, from the diminished capacity of that cavity ; examples of which are related in the present chapter, as well as in the section which treats of the opera- tion on large hernife. Lastly, the occurrence of strangulation is not probable; and, if it should appear, its progress is slow, and relief may be obtained by milder means: yet an objection must be made to the general rule of not operating in irreducible hernias, in behalf of those instances, where the tumour occasions such essential incon- venience and sufiering to the patient, as induce him, when the dangers he incurs have been fullr

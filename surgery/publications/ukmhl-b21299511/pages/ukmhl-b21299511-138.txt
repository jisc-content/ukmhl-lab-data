116 TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED RUPTURES. position near the edge of the bed^ supports ihe lower extremities on his shoulders, so that the patient's head and chest only rest on the bed. Attempts at reduction in this posture are said to have succeeded after every thing else had failed, and have therefore been highly recommended by some surgeons. I cannot fairly appretiate the merits of this proposal, as I have never adopted the practice, nor seen it employed by others. It does not seem to me to promise any advantages that could compensate for the unpleasantness, trouble, and inconvenience inseparably connected with its employment. The proposer of this manoeuvre must have expected to accomplish reduction by the mechanical effect which the weight and dragging of the viscera in the abdo- men would have on the protruded parts. That this idea is completely absurd, must be imme- diately perceived by any one who forms a just notion of the natural state of parts; who is aware that the abdomen is accurately full, and that all its contents are preserved in their relative posi- tions by the pressure of the respiratory muscles; that they cannot therefore fall from one part of the cavity to another, but are probably just in the same place, whether the head or the heels be the most elevated point of the body. Reduction is opposed by the pressure which the protruded

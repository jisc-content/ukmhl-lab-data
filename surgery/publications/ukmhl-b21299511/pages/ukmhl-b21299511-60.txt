The intestine included in a large hernia may be affected with colic, and thus give rise to constiw pation and vomiting. This may be the more easily mistaken for strangulation, if the parts are adherent, and incapable of reduction. Such an attack may render a reducible hernia incapable of being replaced; particularly if the bowels are much inflated. Clysters and oily purgativei will produce stools under these circumstances, and thereby throw light on the real nature of the case. The first appearance of a rupture may occa- sion hiccough, vomiting, and pain ; and the same symptoms may be exhibited in an old case, after the patient has taken much exercise, or remain- ed long in the erect posture, in consequence of irritation excited by the protruded viscera in the contents of the abdomen.

PROGNOSIS OF 58 The incarceration of a small portion of in- testine is the most dangerous, because the opening is narrow and presses closely, while the whole effect of the pressure is felt by the undefended gut; consequently inflammation appears speedily. When the quantity of intestine is greater the ring must be more open, and there is a portion of mesentery to partake of the pressure. The omen- tum protects the intestine more or less in an entero-epiplocele. An incarcerated epiplocele is the least dangerous, and, indeed, is seldom fatal. The sensibility of the omentum is not consider- able in the natural state ; it can bear much pres- sure without inconvenience; and it does not or- dinarily excite very alarming symptoms when in- flamed. In persons of a robust constitution, and of the adult period of life, the symptoms will* partake of the inflammatory character; the ruptures of old subjects are generally of long standing, which, together with the diminished powers of their sys- tem, bestows on the complaint a more languid form. It assumes the same appearance in indi- viduals of a weak frame. The herniae of very young subjects are attended with less danger than of those at a more advanced age, from their organs being more yielding, and because they are less susceptible of acute inflammation. Yet, al- though they are very rarely strangulated, they

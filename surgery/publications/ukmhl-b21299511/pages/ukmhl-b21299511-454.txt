432 CONGENITAL HERNIA I have only two or three remarks to make concerning tlic operation for congenital hernia. The hernial sac should be divided onlj so far as the upper end of the testis; a sufficient portion of the tunica vaginalis to cover that organ com- pletely being left unopened. The incision must extend lower^ if adhesions exist. The parts are often girded by a contraction of the hernial sac, not only where it communi- cates with the abdominal cavitV;, but also in other situations, where we should not have expected this occurrence, Mr. W ilmer* informs us that he has generally found the stricture in these rup- tures to reside in the neck of the sac, and not in the tendon of the external oblique: and Mr. PoTxf mentions an instance of remarkable nar- rovvness in the upper part of the sac. The last mentioned author has seen and re- corded many cases where the hernial sac was con- tracted lower down, so as to embrace the protruded parts Avith great tightness. The intestine has been so closely girded hy this kind of stricture after death, that it could not be withdrawn with- out laceration: and the omentum, from the same cause, has been converted into a firm hard sub- * Pract. Ol-s. p. 10 : nnd Mr. Alakson states that nearly all the cases he has seen of stricture in the neck of the sac jbave been congenital hemiae. Ibid. p. gd, t IForks, vol. Ill, p. 299,

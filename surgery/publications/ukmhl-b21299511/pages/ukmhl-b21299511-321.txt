ARTIFICIAL ANUS. 299 Some have asserted that this contraction proceeds even to obliteration. But this is supported nei- ther by facts nor analogy, Tlie mucous fluid, secreted by the internal membrane, and occasion- ally voided per anum, would maintain the tube; and the protrusion of the gut from the wound in an hiverted state sufficiently proves that it is still hollow. Dissection confirms these arguments, as no instance of obliteration has been recorded. hen the new opening occurs near to the stomach, the food is not submitted for a suffi- ciently long time to the action of the digestive organS;, and it escapes in a half digested state: nutrition is very incompletely performed; and we shall not be surprized at finding the patient become thin and weak, and perish from inani- tion, f Sec the cases quoted in the preceding section^ p. 271.) The matters voided in such cases are not fetid. If the fistulous aperture should be in the lower part of the ileum, in the caecum or colon, the danger is much diminished. The patient can exercise all his functions, and, with the exception of intestinal affections, to which he will probably be subject, his health and strength are not impaired. Here the evacuations are more fetid, as they have been longer retained. In both cases they pass off involuntarily, since the opening has no sphincter to retain them : and this causes a constant uncleanliness of the surrounding parts.

Adipous matter is generally deposited in large quantity in the omentum of fat and elderly persons ; and in this state it escapes very rea- dily from the cavity. Protrusions of the huge intestine consist, generally, either of the caecum, or sigmoid flexure of the colon; as these are the least fixed portions of the canal. When tlie former part descends, it is ordinarily, as we should expect, on the right side; when the latter, on the left. Yet the caBCum and vermi- form appendix have been seen in ruptures of the left side :* and, when we consider that the intes- tines may descend to the knees, dragging even the stomach to the pubes, we shall be convinced that the natural position of an organ cannot, of itself, enable us to determine at which opening it may be protruded.

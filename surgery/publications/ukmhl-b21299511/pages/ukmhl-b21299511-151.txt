BLOOD-LETTING. 129 I would have it understood that this observa- tion applies to the indiscriminate employment of large and repeated bleedings. As patients, who die after the operation, have generally appear- ances of inflammation in the abdominal contents, I am aware that a judicious use of venesection, if it does not contribute to the return of the parts, cannot be injurious on the principles above- mentioned. I think that the advocates and op- ponents of blood-letting have stated their opinions too strongly on the opposite sides of the ques- tion, and that a prudent practitioner will take a middle course between these two extrenies. He will not with Pott use venesection in all instances, neither will he follow Mr. Wilmer in discarding it entirely from the treatment of hernia, but will restrict its employment to a certain class of cases. He will have recourse to it when the strangu- lation is of the inflammatory kind; when the hernia is small and recent; the abdomen tense and painful; and the patient young, strong, and plethoric. Two cases are related in the excellent Practical Observations of Mr. Hey*, which will serve to shew under what circumstances venesec- tion i^ allowable. The experience of this judi- cious practitioner leads him to concur with * P. 124.

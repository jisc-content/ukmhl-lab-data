The symptoms will not entirely disappear, until evacuations per anum have occurred; and these in general do not take place spontaneously. The bowels arc irritated and oppressed by the accu- mulation of their contents consequent on the ob- struction. Hence mild purgatives, such as small doses of vitriolated magnesia, and clysters, should be ordered immediately after the reduction^ and repeated at proper intervals, until the whole col- lection is cleared away.* This conduct will be more particularly necessary if the strangulation appears to have arisen from accumulation of the intestinal contents. \V here inflammation lias been excited, pre- viously to reduction, the effect will not cease, on the removal of its mechanical causef. A continua- * RicHTER has been surprised at the prodigious quantity of alvine discharges, produced by the action of purgatives,after the reduction of a strangulated hernia ; and he believes that a species of gastric fever follows violent strangulation. He has seen, under such circumstances, a true bilious fever; conti- nuing for several days, und removed by the repeated employ- ment of purgatives. He warns us against confounding a fe- verish affection of this kind with the effects of inflamed bowels 5 since bleeding, and the other means necessary in the latter case, would only aggravate the evil in the former.â€”TV. des Her. p. 68. f Deatli has occurred from peritoneal inflammation, in a

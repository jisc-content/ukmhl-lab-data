GENERAL DESCRIPTION 10 hernia of the bladder^ as will be explained in the chapter on that subject^ difters from other rup- tures with respect to its sac. I have never seen any other destitute of a peritoneal covering ; but authors of reputation state the following as cases in which no sac exists: viz. Hernias con- sequent on penetrating wounds of the abdomen : those which return after an operation ; or^ where the sac has been destroyed by caustic or other means, with a view to the radical cure. Some add umbilical herniae : this point will be con- sidered in the chapter on that subject. The contents of a hernial sac are some part or parts ordinarily contained in the abdomen; and commonly the omentum, or intestines. These are the most moveable viscera, and occupy the front and lower part of the belly: their relative position explains, why, in a mixed case, the lat- ter are covered by the former. The small intes- tine, from the greater looseness of its connexion, is more frequently protruded than ihe large; and the ileum more frequently than the jejunum, in consequence of its greater proximity to the ring and crural arch. A part only of the diameter of the tube is sometimes included in a hernia; any larger quantity may descend, from a single afterwards operated. It contained omentum not covered by any sac.

The relation which the neck of the tumour bears to the crural arch, and to the spine of the pubes, will enable the practitioner to dis- tinguish the two cases. If the swelling of a crural hernia be draw'n downwards, it will be foimd that the crural arch can be traced passing over the neck of the sac; while in bubonocele it is found under that part. The spine of the pubes, which is behind and below the neck of the sac in an inguinal hernia, is on the same horizontal level , and rather within it in the crural •Rpecies*. RicHTER has seen this mistake often committed, even by pci iions of experience—7V. des Herincs, p. 243; and Mr. Cooper has witnessed similar blunders. The facility with which this mistake may be committed is probably the i^ason why the existence of crural hernia, as a distinct species, was so long overlooked. Ferheyen, who pub- lished his Ar.nlomia Corporis Humant in 1003, is generally considered to have been the first who noticed it, I subjoin the passage, as it contains an instance, in which the rupture caused no external swelling. *' Alius huic vicinus locus est, '* wh'x fiunt herniae periculosae et saepe lethales; scilicet' ubi " vence etarterioe iliacge tendunt ad crura.After mentioning

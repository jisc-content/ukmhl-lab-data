"WOUNDS OF THE EPIGASTRIC ARTERY. 213 from so large an artery as the external iliac^ ren- der tlie assertion very probable. Yet I have not been able to meet with any recorded cases, in which actual examination has proved a wound of this vessel to be the cause of death.* GuNzf says that he heard uf two cases in Paris, in which the artery had been divided. Bertrandi;]; and RiCHTER§ assert in general terms that a fatal hemorrhage has ensued several times from divi- sion of tlie epigastric artery.

In one of Mr. Hey's** cases there was considerable bleeding, but it was stopped by the use of sponge. The case, which I have just related, presents an example of the epigastric * I mean in hernia.

After it had been used for four months by a patient of the hotel des Invalides, he gave a very favourable certificate* of its effects in removing the inconve- niences arising from the discharge of the feceSj and enabling the patient to follow his ordinary occupa- tions. A common elastic truss, with a compress of linen under the pad, has been found in some instances more serviceable, than any complicated instrument, in preventing the continual flow of feculent matter from the artificial openingf; and the employment of a piece of sponge;}; has been suggested with the same view: but it is hardly practicable to remedy this inconvenience altoge- ther.

Let the surgeon embrace the neck of the swelling, close to the tendon, with the finger and thumb of one hand, and carry them down- wards with a moderate pressure, so as to remove the contents from the portion next to the ring ; this will reduce the size of that part, which he may then attempt to pass into the ring with the other hand. Indeed, since the obstacle exists at the mouth of the sac, reduction will in general be more easily effected by pressing the upper part of the tumour towards the ring, than by exerting a general pressure over the whole swelling. The surgeon should place himself in a situa- tion which he can occupy without inconvenience for a considerable time, since he must persist in his attempts for an hour in some cases, before he gives up the expectation of success; and it often happens that, by perseverance in trying various positions and modes of pressure, herniae are ulti- mately replaced, which did not yield at all to the first attempts. If the efforts at reduction, managed accord- ing to the above directions, are not attended with success, the following method has been recom- inended. A strong man placed in a convenient i2

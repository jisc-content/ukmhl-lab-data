OPERATION rOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. 201 Many surgeons are accustomed to make great use of the probe in this part of the operation: they thrust the blunt end of the instrument into the cellular substance, and divide with the knife what tliey have thus raised. This practice car- ries with it a great appearance of roughness and auk ward ness, and is a much less convenient and speedy way of accomplishing the intended object, than the method which I have described. The variations, which I have mentioned in the course of the spermatic vessels and vas de- ferens, should lead us to ascertain, if possible, the situation of these parts before we operate, that we may avoid all risk of wounding them. The practice of dividing the integuments and hernial sac separately, and of dissecting the inter- vening substance cautiously, will protect these vessels from danger where their course cannot be made out. The plan, which has been recom- mended, of making a small cut in the skin, of opening the cavity of the tumour, and then car- rying the incision through the rest of the skin and hernial sac at once, would certainly expose them to considerable danger. Mr. Hey* divided the vas deferens in this manner. * Practical 01 s. p. 146.

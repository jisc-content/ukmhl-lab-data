OF THE FEMORAL RUPTURE. 361 of rupture. These considerations would un- doubtedly have justified Mr. Else iu opening the tumour in the fatal case of ciural hernia, M'hich he has recorded in the fourth volume of the Medical Observations and Inquiries; for the want of fecal evacuations clearly pointed out the nature of the aifection. I have seen a hospital surgeon, a man of coeh siderable practice and eminence in his profession, mistake a femoral hernia for a glandular enlarge- ment, although the attendant symptoms suffi- ciently indicated the nature of the complaint. So strongly did the tumour in all its sensible characters resemble a swoln gland,, that the ope- ration was not performed, although the marks of stranguiation were present; and the patient's death afforded an opportunity of ascertaining that the complaint had been caused by a protru- sion of the bowel. Mr. Cooper informs us, that a surgeon in considerable practice sent into Guy's Hospital a man with a crural hernia, which had been poulticed for three days on the supposition of its being a venereal bubo : and when the ope- ration was performed the intestine was found mortified. In another case the swelling was opened, under a similar mistake ; the stools were discharged at the opening, and the patient soon jifter died*. Similar fatal errors are recorded by * Pt. II. p. 8.

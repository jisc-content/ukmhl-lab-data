Mr. Hey has very candidly stated that he had, from experience^ gained a knowledge of the proper manner of performing the operation, before he had acquired from anatomical investi- gations, a just idea of the part, which principally causes the strangulation. He adds, that he had often wondered that so small a division of the most interior part of the.stricture should be suf- ficient for reduction. It will generally be practicable to introduce the tip of the finger or of the nail under the edge of the tendon; the fibres of which should be carefully divided in succession, with the probe- pointed knife, until we havG gained just sufficient room to replace the contents of the swelling*. * Tr.

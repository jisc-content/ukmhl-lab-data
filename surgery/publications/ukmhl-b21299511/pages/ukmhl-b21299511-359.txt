OF THE FEMORAL RUPTURE. SSt glandj is called by Gimbernat*, the crural, and by Mr. HEvf the femoral vins;. The space in question is bounded above and in front by the crural arch; below and behind by the pubes; on the internal or mesial side by the thin border of the tendon; and on the outer or lateral aspect . by the crural vein;];. The fascia lata, or fascia of the thigh, has two distinct insertions at the upper and anterior part of the limb. It is attached to the front edge of the pubes, over the origin of the pectineus, the fibres of which it closely covers, and it is also fixed to the front of the crural arch. The former of these is continuous, behind the femoral vessels^ with the iliac fascia: the latter is not inserted along the whole length of the tendon, its attach- ment ceasing on the inner side of the vessels, which it covers anteriorly. Here, therefore, the femoral artery and vein are interposed between the two divisions. Under the anterior portion of the crural arch a large oval depression is found on the front of the thigh, on the surface of the pectineus muS' * P. 38. i P. 148. + See the measurements quoted from Mr. Cooper, at p. 10'5.

The dysury, the power of dimi- nishing the swelling by pressure, and the desire of making water consequent on this, suffici- ntlr distinguish the case. To the peculiar symptoms of CTstocelc will be added those of an intestinal or omental rupture, when the affection is compli- cated. In some cases the protrusion of the blad- der has been attended with no symptoms.

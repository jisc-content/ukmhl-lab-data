A STRANGULATED RUPTURE. 39 toms arise from the hernia, would here be not only useless, but even injurious ; and the surgeon would neglect those means which the inflamma- tion of the bowels so urgently demands. T\ henever we see a patient labouring under the symptoms of ileus, w^e should suspect the existence of a rupture, and make those inquiries and examinations, which such a suspicion would naturally suggest, particularly in females, who are often led to concealment by motives of false delicacy. A superficial examination is not suf- ficient on these occasions; as a very small por- tion of intestine, not forming any external tu- mour, may, by its incarceraticHi, cause the symp- toms. If the latter have appeared suddenly, and under circumstances which might cause a rup- ture ; if the pain hav^ been first felt about the ring or crural arch, and if pressure in these si- tuations increase it; and, lastly, if the patient, shortly before, had been in perfect health, there is strong reason to suspect the existence of a hernia. When a person labouring under ileus has a hernia, which can be reduced easilv, there is no ground for doubt; if, on the contrary, the parts cannot be replaced, strangulation may be reason- ably suspected, although we cannot immediately conclude, with certainty, that the swelling is the cause of the inflammation.

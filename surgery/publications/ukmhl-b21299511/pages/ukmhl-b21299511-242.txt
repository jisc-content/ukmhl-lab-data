220 OPERATION FOll STRANGULATKD HERNIA. general, is not sunicient to enable them to adopt this mode of operating without danger. If the parts be adherent to each other, or to the sac, they cannot be returned without opening the latter cavity; hence this must be done at last, or else the patiei.t will be left with an irreducible hernia, that will constantly expose him to the risk of a future strangulation*. How often does the state of the omentum require that a part of it should be removed, either because it has increased so much in size, as to be irreducible without a very extensive dilatation of the ring; or because it is so altered in structure, that it must necessarily perish. If, in the mode of operating which we are now considering, a portion of this viscus should be returned into the abdomen in a gan- grenous state, and slough in the cavity, it would constitute a source of most serious danger to the patient; nud very probably cause a fatal termi- nation. The consequences of returning a gan- grened intestine into the abdomen must also be considered, as this might very easily take place. It often happens that this change is not indicated by any syui])toms, and that it occurs in an early stage of the complaint: it is also most frequent * Monro mentions four cases, in which he attempted this operation ; he was oWiged to cut the neck of the sac in two; and adhesions prevented the return of some of the parts in the tliird.

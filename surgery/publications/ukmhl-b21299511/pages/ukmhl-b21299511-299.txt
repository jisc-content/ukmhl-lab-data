WITH MORTIFICATION, 277 I sliall content myself with adding* to the evidence already addnced, the testimony of De- SAULT, whose experience on this pohit is com- pletely decisive. In operating on an hernia, he found an eschar of an inch in diameter on the in- testine. He returned this part, and no subsequent symptoms occurred to denote the separation of the slough. He conceives tliat the inflammation of the part surroundings the eschar, agglutinated it to the parietes of the abdomen; and that the slough passed along the intestinal canal. But it is not on the event of a single case that he rests the propriety of this practice: he recommends it from the favourable result of his general expe- rience. He has relinquished the loop of thread through the mesentery; " being convinced by experience, and particularly from dissection, that the portion which forms the hernia, never " recedes from the ring, and that there is no reason to apprehend an eftusion into the ab- dominal cavity on the separation of the es- char*." Similar instances are mentioned in the French medical Journal entitled Recuf.il periodique (Tohservations, &c, v. 21, p. 124 : in the Giornale di Medicina, Q, p. 401 : and 11, 25 : in the Neue Abhandlungen der Schwed. Jkademie, 8, p. 36 : and in Theden, Neue Bemerkungen, p. 99. * Parisian Surgical Journal, vol. II p. 366.

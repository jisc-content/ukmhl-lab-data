188 ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTtRES. ject. The round ligament of the uterus has the same relation to the swelling, as the spermatic chord in the male. The parts may be protruded through the superior aperture, and be contained in the abdominal canal; tliey may pass through the whole canal: or they may be protruded di- rectly through the inferior aperture. The only instance which I have seen of the latter kind, in the female, occurred in a subject, which was brought to the anatomical theatre at St. Bar- tholomew's hospital, for dissection; aad it was discovered' by Mr. Haffenden, a very intelli- gent and industrious student^ who pointed it out to me.

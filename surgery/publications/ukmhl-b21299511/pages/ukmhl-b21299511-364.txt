342. ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION ticiilar names; and these are sup])osed to belong to distinct and separate organs. Let the student constantly bear in mind that these are all inti- mately connected, and that the diftbrent names indicate parts of one continuous expansion. The iliac fascia should be regarded as a part of the fascia lata; the thin border of the crural arch^ and the semi-lunar portion of the fascia lata are so intimately connected, that no just idea can be formed of them in an insulated state. This general connexion maintains all the parts in a condition of mutual tension, which is materially affected by the position of the thigh, in conse- quence of the attachment of the femoral aponeu- rosis to the crural arch. The latter is drawn and the oval depression in which the saphcna is placed at its termination. By detaching the lunated edge of the fascia from the crural arch, the femoral artery and vein will be exposed, and if these are cut across, and turned upwards, the continua- tion of the fascia lata from the pectineus muscle, behind them, and over the pubes, to constitute the fascia iliaca, is brought into view. When the peritoneum is separated from these parts on the inside, the iliac portion of the femoral fascia (fascia iliaca) is exposed, with the iliac vessels lying on itj its connexion with the crural arch j the broad insertion of the arch into the spine and crista of the pubes j its cresccntic edge, and the space between tliis margin and the iliac vein, called the femoral ring, are also exposexi. By dividing either the thin border of the arch, or the semi-lunar edge of the fascia ur-AT xht arch, the connexion and muUial tension of these parti ^ ill be perceived.

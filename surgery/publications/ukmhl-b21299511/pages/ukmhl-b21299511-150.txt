128 TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED RUPTURES. tion: the weight of Mr. Cooper's* experience has been added on the same side of the question. The degree^ in which any particular mode of treatment can contribute to liberate the contents of a strangulated hernia from stricture, is the fair criterion by which its merits should be estimated. An examination of blood-letting, according to this rule, will not lead us to place that confi- dence in its powers, to which the strong recom- mendation of Pott, of Richter, and of Cal- LisEN would otherwise have entitled it. Vene- section cannot enlarge the opening through which the hernial contents have descended; it cannot diminish the bulk of the prolapsed parts ; nor has it the power of exciting any action of the viscera, which might extricate them from the stricture : yet, if it were found actually beneficial in practice, these tlieoretical objections might be justly disregarded; but it has gradually fallen into coniparative disuse among the practitioners of this metropolis^ from the experience of its frequent inefficacy. A means of such powerful operation as blood-letting, if useless, can hardly escape the suspicion of being injurious; and such, no doubt, it must be, when indiscrimi- nately employed in the treatment of strangulated hernia. ^ Anatomy ^c, of Inguinal Uernin, p. 29.

451 HERNIA OF THE BLADDER. If tlie bladder, either from being naturally large^ or from having' its capacity increased in consequence of retention of urine, is placed behind the ring, when undistended, it may be propelled through the opening just as easily as any other of the abdominal contents. In this case a portion of the anterior surface is first pro- truded ; and, as this is connected by cellular substance to the surrounding parts, without pos- sessing a peritoneal covering, the rupture in this stage possesses no hernial sac. When we observe the fundus of the bladder, in retensions of urine, rising to the umbilicus or higher, notwithstand- ing the cellular adhesions which unite it to the pubes, we shall conclude that these connexions will not prevent the rupture from increasing under the continued action of the same causes, which first produced it. The neighbouring part of the fundus or side of the bladder, where it is covered by peritoneum, is gradually drawn through the ring, and forms a kind of hernial sac, which has a very different relation to the protruded part of the bladder, from that which the peritoneal covering bears to the contents of an ordinary rupture. It forms a membranous cavity, ending below in a cul de sac, opening above into the abdomen, and lying in front of the bladder, to the anterior surface of which its pos- G S 3

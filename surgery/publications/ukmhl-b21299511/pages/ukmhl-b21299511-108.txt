The means designed to ac- complish this object are called tlie radical, in opposition to the use of trusses, or the palliative cure. As they are now no longer practised, a detailed description of them will not be necessary; but their entire omission would have been hardly justifiable in a work professing to exhibit a view of the whole subject; more particularly as a statement of the question concerning the radical cure could bv no means have been neglected. The operations devised by the ancients for the purpose of preventing the passage of the viscera into that production of peritoneum, which forms the hernial sac, were begun by a reduction of the parts, which were then retained by the hand of an assistant. A caustic was now applied to the skin, opposite to the ring, so as to form a small eschar. When this separated, if the sac were not sufficiently exposed, a caustic was again applied, until it was destroyed. The cure was then con- ducted by simple dressings, as in a common ulcer, and the cicatrix thus formed was expected to op- pose the future descent of the abdominal viscera. Messrs.

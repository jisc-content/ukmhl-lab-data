6 GENERAL DESCRIPTION SO as to form a bag of various size and figure, communicating with the abdomen by a compara- tively small opening, called the mouth o fiJie sac. The contracted part between the mouth, and the point at which the membrane begins to expand, is the neck; and the most distant point from the abdomen^ which is generally at the same time the largest^ has been termed the fundus of the sac. The peritoneum, which always immediately surrounds the protruded viscera, retains generally the same thin and delicate structure, which cha- racterises the membrane in its natural situation. The peritoneal sac is covered by another invest- ment of various degrees of thickness, differing according to the part in which the swelling is formed, and sometimes even double. Probably this is formed, in great part, of the surrounding cellular substance, condensed into a membrane- like appearance, by the pressure of the hernia, in the same way as tumours acquire their invest- ing cyst. The thickness of the sac, taken alto- gether, depends on these adventitious coverings, the peritoneum changing very little. They ac- quire considerable density and firmness in old ruptures: thus the sac has been seen of six lines hi thickness.* It may be found in the opposite state, or remarkably thin. * Arnaud, Manoires de Chirurgie, t. 1, p. 53.

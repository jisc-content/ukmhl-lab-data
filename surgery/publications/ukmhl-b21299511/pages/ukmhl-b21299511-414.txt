A practical precept^ derived from the sup-r posed want of the hernial sac, of proceeding with great caution in exposing the contents of an um- bilical rupture, which requires the operation, is just as necessary as if the anatomical observation, which suggested it, had been strictly correct. The hand of a prudent operator will be guided by this maxim in every species of rupture; but the present case certainly requires a more strict attention to such a precaution, since in many cases the iiitc^guments aiKl hernial sac cannot be distinguished on the front of the tumour.

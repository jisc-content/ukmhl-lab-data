She was seized, in about six weeks after the ope- ration^ with yiolent pain in the lower part of the abdomen, which terminated in two days in a discharge of the feces through the wound, and perfect ease.

A small ulcerated aperture was discovered in this part; and led, in a fistulous form, through a substance nearly equal in size to the little finger^ to the external wound.

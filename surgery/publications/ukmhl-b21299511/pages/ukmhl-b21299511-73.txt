OF STUANGLLATION. 51 Tlie slow strang'ulation takes place in large and old hernige, which have been often protruded and replaced, or which have been long unreduced. The contained intestines, removed from their na- tural situation, and no longer supported by the pressure of the respiratory muscles, are probably rendered somewhat indolent in performing their functions ; as patients of this kind are habitually subject to costiveness and intestinal complaints. The contents of the alimentary canal will easily be retained in a situation where they enter the intestine without difficulty, but have their egress obstructed by the force of gravity. The entrance of indigested food, of worms, or of a foreign body, into such a tumour, would be very likely to cause irritation and obstruction, and a con- sequent accumulation of the intestinal contents. The strangulation arising from such an accu- mulation constitutes the case, which has been only elapsed between the occurrence of strangulation and the patient's death.â€”(Anatomy and Surgkal Treatment of Ingui-' nal and Congenital Hernice, p. 26.) The same author also gives an instance of umbilical hernia, in which the progress to a fatal termination was remarkably rapid. The symptoms were of the most acute and violent description : death hap- pened in seventeen hours and a half after strangulation began j and the integuments had already mortified at one part of the swelling. {Anatomy and Surgicc.l Treatment of Crural and Umlilical Hernia, p. 45.)

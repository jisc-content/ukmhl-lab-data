112 TREATMENT OF STRANCCLATED RUPTURES. protruded parts; which operation is technically termed the taxis. When the swelling is free from stricture, this replacement is generally very easy; hut when the parts are more closely girt, the operation is rendered proportionally difhcult^ and requires that attention should he paid to the position of the body, and to other circumstances, which may influence the chance of success. The patient should lie down when we attempt the taxis, as many circumstances prove that the re- cumbent position contributes materially to the return of the prolapsed parts. When the rup- ture is of the inguinal or crural kind, the pelvis should be placed higher than the shoulders, so that the swelling itself may constitute the most elevated point of the trunk. The patient's blad- der should be previously emptied; and he must carefully abstain from coughing, holding hisÂ« breath, or any similar efforts. These precautions' procure us as much room as possible in the ab- dominal cavity, and favour the return of the. protruded parts, as far as that ojject can he- effected, by the force of gravity. The position of the patient must also be regulated with a view to the opening, through which the parts have descended. Hence, in in- guinal and crural hernia, the thigh should be bent, and rolled inwards; in order to relax the tendon of the external oblique muscle. It is also

424 CONGENITAL HERNIA surface, while the more loose process^ that passes with it into the scrotum, forms the tunica vagi- nalis testis*. * The nuinefous descriptions of the descent of the testis, which are already before the public, render it quite unneces- sary for me to enter on that subject on the present occasion. I shall merely present the reader with the observations of Wu I SB ERG concerning the period at which this body changes ks situation, and the varieties which occur in the process. Before the beginning of the sixth month the testis is always contained in the abdomenj and is generally near the kidney, but it may be behind the ring: this circumstance therefore affords a criterion respecting the age of a fetus. But the rule does not seem to be entirely without exception : for Arnaud mentions, in his French translation of Hunter's account of this subject, that J. Hunter had met with a fetus of six months, in which one testis had passed completely into the scrotum, (see Mem, de Chirurgie^ t. I. note to p. 25) ; and Wrisberg himself, on a subsequent occasion, states that he had found both testes in the scrotum in an embryo of four and in another of five month--. (See Loder's Journal fur die Chi- rurgie, B. I, St. 2, p. 175.) In the interval between the beginning of the sixth, and the end of the seventh month, it may be seen above the ring, or in its passage through the opening, or just below it. When it has passed the tendon of the external oblique, it may still at iBrst be pushed back into the abdomen, as the oj)ening of com- munication is not yet closed. In the eighth month ihesc organs have generally passed the ring, but have not descended jHto the scrotum j the tunica vaginalis communicating with the abdomen, or the intermediate canal being closed ordinarily. Both testes have arrived at the bottom of the scrotum in the

OP The femoral rupture. 339 or horn^ of this crescent, is the last portion of the fascia, towards the inside, connected to the crural arch, and it bends under the tendon so as to unite with the thin portion or border at its commence- ment. The concavity is turned towards the oppo- site limb, and the inferior horn is situated down- wards and outwards on the thigh. This fold covers the femoral artery and vein just under Poupart's ligament, excepting a small portion of the latter at its inner side. The lower horn of the crescent is continuous with a second semi-lunar edge, having its concavity turned upwards, and forming the inferior boundary of the oval space*. firm margin, which is traced someway down the thigh. The edge is lunated, and the concavity is directed towards *' the pubes, or superficial vein. This is the usual appearance of the parts; sometimes, however, the structure is not quite *' so distinct, for occasionally a considerable quantity of reti- " cular cellular matter is placed about, and adheres to the crcscentic margin of the fascia. Nevertheless, in every instance, this lunated edge may be discovered, by passing " the finger from the abdomen through the crural ring, and " pressing outward; and by dissection it may be clearly de- monstrated in emaciated anasarcous subjects.'* ^ This must be the part described by Mr. Burns in the following passage : " about an inch and a half below the crest " of the pubes, the pectinral apcncurosis sends off a process " or duplicature to be inserted into the under surface of the " fascia, at a very little distance from the falciform process j and this duplicature divides the superficial vein and lym- z2

IN THE MALE SUBJECT. 431 close, this effect Avill probably take place in a young subject, if the viscera be replaced and maintained in their natural situation, by means of a proper truss. A radical cure of the com- plaint will thus be effected in a very short time. The same event cannot be looked for at a more advanced age, where the employment of a truss, as in other species of the complaint, must be regarded merely as a palliative measure. Before the surgeon applies a truss for an inguinal or scrotal rupture in a young subject, he must not only satisfy himself that the pro- truded parts are fairly replaced, but that the testicle itself has arrived at its natural situation in the scrotum. A rupture may take place in an infant when this gland has not yet quitted the abdomen. 1 have already mentioned two cases of scrotal hernia, in which the testis on the af- fected side had never passed the ring. Mr. Pott* and HALLERf have furnished us with similar in- stances. The application of a truss to a young fiubjcct, thus circumstanced, might prove inju- rious by retarding the descent of the testis. If it should have arrived only so far as the groin, the pressure of the pad on the gland maybe attended with still worse effects. * jdccount of a particular species of rupture, &c, p. 34; f Opera Minora, yoi-III* ^.

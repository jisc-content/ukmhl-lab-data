467 TAGINAL RUPTURE. The situation^ in which the protrusion begins, is the same as in the perineal rupture; but the dilference between the two cases is_, that the vagi- na, which resists in the latter, yields in the former instance. Hence we should expect, what we find b} experience to be true; viz. tliat wo- men who have had children are the most subject to this complaint. The distension of the vagina and surrounding parts in such persons mustweaken the powers of resistance. It may occur, how- ever, in females who have never borne children*. The small intestine seems to be the part most frequently protruded : the urinary bladder some- times descends, and the tumour then is on the an- terior or upper surface of the vagina. The causes of the complaint dg not difler from those of other ruptures: it has generally been formed in consequence of bodily exertion, as in raising a great weight, straining at stool, &c.

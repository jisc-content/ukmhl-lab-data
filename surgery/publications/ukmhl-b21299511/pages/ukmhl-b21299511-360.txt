AxNATOMICAL DESCRIPTION 338 cle*. At the upper, outer, and lower sides, this hollow is bounded by a sharp and defined edge of the fascia ; but it has no such boundary inter- nally. Where the attachment of the fascia lata to the crural arch terminates, it forms a distinct semi- lunar, or crescent-shaped foldf. The upper end, * BrcHAT, in describing the fascia of the thigh, says, " Elle est perc^e de divers trous pour le passage des vaisseaux ct nerfs. Le plus remarcjuable de ces trous est celui qui, place sous le ligament de Fallope, au devant du pectine, " donue passage a la veine saphene." Anat. Dcscr. t. 2, pt 309. It is strange that so remarkable a feature in the anatomy of the fascia should have been entirely overlooked by SoEMMEREiNC, both in his account of the fascia, and of the vein. De Corp. hum. fab. t. 3, ^ 281 : and t. 5, ยง 263. -j- This part is represented in the first plate of Mr. Cooper's work on inguinal hernia, allliough it is not marked by any letter of reference. Its upper extremity is designated by the letter k in Mr. Hey's plate, as forming his femoral ligament. Pract. Ols. plate IV. But Mr. A. Burns of Glasgow has described it the most minutely, under the name of ihi fnlcifoTm process of the fascia lata, in " Observations on the Structure of the Parts concerned in Crural Hernia," contained in the 2d vol. of the Edinlurgh Medical and Surgical Jvurnal, p. 265 274, with two phUes. In describing that portion of the fascia lata, which is fixed to the crural arch, Mr. Burns gives the following account of the falciform process. " Just where this layer ceases to arise from the arch, we find the superficial vein entering, and therefore this vein is not covered with- the inner or principal layer of the fascia, and, on dissecting " away the vein we see still better the structure of these parts : we find that the fascia stops just at the entrance of this " vein, andj in many cases, it terminates abruptly with a neat.

UMBILICAL HERNIA IN THE ADULT. 417 pad, which is meant to press on the operiin"-. By means of this a strong and constant force is applied, wliich keeps the viscera constantly re- duced. In the instrument, as described by Mr. Hey, a spring extends from either end of the oval ring towards the backj where the two neaily meet together. This part of the truss has been sometimes found inconvenient; and the end has been answered equally well, when its place was supplied by a broad leather belt fastened to one end of the oval ring, and buckled to the other, after passing round the body*. An irreducible exomphalos of moderate size , may sometimes be conveniently supported, and prevented from enlarging, by means of a triiss with a hollow pad. If however its magnitude be considerable, other means of supporting the tu- mour must be resorted to; such as suspending it over the shoulders by bandages passed under the swelling. The treatment of a strangulated umbilical Umbilical trusses of a more complicated construction have been devised; one is described in the 2nd vol. of the Mem. de I'Acad, deChir. by Mr. Surf.t ; and it was approved by the academy. Juville has a similar one In his treatise. The object of both these is to admit of the truss enlarging and contracting according to the varying dimensions of the abdo- men. RicHTER has rendered this truss more simple. P,239, E e

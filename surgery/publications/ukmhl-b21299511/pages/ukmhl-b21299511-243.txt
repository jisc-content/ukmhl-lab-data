OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA, 221 in small hernias. The eHusion of the contents of the intestinal canal into the abdomen^ when the eschar gives way, would be attended with the most dangerous consequences. The chance of a reproduction of the hernia must be much in- creased by the practice of leaving the sac un- opened ; indeed the viscera must necessarily descend into the bag which remains in the groin ready for their reception. The utter impracticability of the proposal fof returnhig the sac into the abdomen with its con- tents, except in the most recent cases, accounts sufficiently for its never having been put in practice, and relieves me from the necessity of considering it more at large*. * Petit, who first proposed the division of the ring with* out ope ning the hernial sac, used to place a compress of lint on tlic part, after the operation ; he states that the sac has in many instances gradnaDv returned within the ring; and that It will always do so in small or middle-sized ruptures, particu- larly if we push up at first as much of it as we can. See his posthumous work, Sur les Mai. Chirurg. t. 2. p, 375. Ga- RENGEOT, in describing the proceeding of Petit, says, that after pushing up the parts, " il entasse le sac en un petit bloc, " ct le met dans I'overture meme de I'etranglcment j et par- " dessus une petite pelotie qu'il a imaginee." The eldi::r Monro adopted this view of the subject. He directs that the sac should be left entire, and pushed wp into the ring, " if the " disease is recent, with the sac thin, and not folded into " wrinkles, or straitened where it is coming, through the pas- sa^es in the muscle", ox groum to any other part,'* Edhtb,

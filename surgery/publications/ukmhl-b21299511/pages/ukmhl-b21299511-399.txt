OPERATION FOR FEMORAL HERNIA. 377 Particular caution is required in opening the sac, as this hernia never contains more than a very small quantity of fluid; and as the pro- truded part is very frequently a portion of intes- tine unaccompanied by omentum, Tlic direction of the incision for the removal of the stricture is a very material point of consi- deration, from the important parts, which so closely surround the neck of the sac. If the knife be directed upwards and outwards, the epigastric artery is greatly endangered. If we cut straight upwards, the spermatic chord is exposed to risk*. The latter source of danger does not, however^ exist in female subjects, on whom the operation is performed in the great majority of instances. An incision of the most interior part of the stricture is free from all dan- not divided; and this constituted the round opening I have, describfd in the middle of the tumour. When the narrowness of the stricture in crural hernia is considered, it seems dilficult to understand how so considerable a bulk of parts could be returned: but further examination removed this difficulty. The crural arch had been completely detached from the pubes, so that the incision extended from the crural into the lower abdominal ring. Fortunately the spermatic chord was not injured. The parts were removed, and are now in ray posses- sio.n, so that the narrative admits of complete authentication, * Abnaud divided tjie spermatic artery in a case of crural hernia; and a fatal hemorrhage into the abdomen ensued.

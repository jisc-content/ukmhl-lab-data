OPERATION FOR LARGE IIERNIJ2. 243 Section IX. Operation where the Tamour has not passed the Jiitig. In the case^ where the viscera, having entered the upper opening of the ring*, are strangulated by its sides, without having descended through the ring of the external oblique, the aponeurosis of the latter muscle must be divided, in order to expose the tumour. A longitudinal inci- sion, beginning above the swelling, should be carried over its middle, and the cellular substauce should then be dissected, so as to expose the ten- don. When a small opening has been made in the latter, a probe or director may be introduced, and will enable us to extend the cut sufficiently to bring the tumour fairly into view. When the sac is laid open, the edge of the transversus and obliquus internus may be divided either upwards or towards the spine of the ilium; because the epigastric artery, in this case, is constantly found at the inner edge of the mouth of the sac. b2

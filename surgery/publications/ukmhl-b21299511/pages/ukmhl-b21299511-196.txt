174 ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. * CampeRj tab. V. and XII, easily conceive that the relation of the tumour to this part may be changed in the canal^ or at the lower aperture, so as to present the varieties just enumerated. When we consider that the epigastric artery in the natural state goes first behind the sper- matic chord, and then along the inner margin of the upper opening, and that the viscera are pro- truded over the chord, it will immediately ap- pear, that, in the case of bubonocele, which we are now considering, the parts are protruded on the outer side of the artery, and that this vessel must be situated first behind the neck of the sac, and then on its inner side.* This is so precisely the caÂ«e, that, if we examine the mouth of the sac towards the abdomen, its inner margin (the me- sial, or that which is situated towards the pubes) seems to be actually formed by the course of the artery. It retains always the same situation in respect to the mouth of the sac: but the approx- imation of the upper to the lower opening brings it nearer to the pubes. In the natura Istate, it is about two inches from the angle of that bone, at the part where it bends along the inner margin of the opening; its distance at the correspondhig part, in a bubonocele now before me, is only three quarters of an inch.

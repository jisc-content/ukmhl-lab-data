178 ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. Ihe inner side of the hernial gae,* which, at this? precise point, becomes continuous with the peri- toneum lining: the abdomen. The removal of the hernial sac will disclose the course of the sper- matic chord in its descent towards the testicle; and when this is also elevated, the first part of ihe course of the epigastric artery, and its origin from the iliac trunk, are laid open.f In the species of bubonocele now described, the cause of strangulation may exist in the upper aperture of the abdominal canal, or in the lower aperture, or in the neck of the sac. According to Mr. Cooper,the first is most frequent in recent and small hernia*, the second in old and large ruptures. The stricture may occur in the upper orifice, where the parts have passed the ring completely, the tendon of the obliquus ex- ternus remaining loose and free: a rupture may also be strangulated by both openings at once. The strangulation in the upper opening pro- bably constitutes the case, which surgeons have generally described as arising from a stricture ia the neck of the sac. We can readily conceive, that the parts, which form this opening, inaT * Campebi hones, tab. X. F. M. f The work of Camfbr exhibits these facts very clearly, see Tab, V, IX, X and XII. X Page 21.

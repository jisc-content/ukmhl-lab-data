351 OF THE FEMOllAL RUPTURE. The viscera descend over the pubes, where the pectineal portion of the fascia lata, after cioselj covering the musclCj is inserted into the bone; hence the tumour is situated in front of the pectiiieus, and of the fascia lata. I think it right to be more explicit on this point as sur- geons have generally supposed that the femoral rupture is covered by the fascia of the thigh*; and tliey even go so far as to say, that, in per- forming the operation we may cut boldly through the integuments on this very account. I sus- pected the truth of this representation, from having often looked in vain for the fascia in operations; and from observing that the tumour feels loose, and has a circumscribed edge, instead of being tense, and having that obscurely defined margin, which we should expect, if it were covered with the fascia. Dissection has shewn that my suspicion was well grounded. If the * This opinion will be found in most surgical books : that it is retained, even in very modern works, will be proved by tlie two following quotations. Monro states that a crural is less moveable than a scrotal hernia, in consequence of its being immediately covered and bound down by the tendinous aponeurosis of the muscles of the thigh. On Crural Hernia, p. 56. We know also that the herniary tumour is in truth under the fascia." Systcw of Operative Surgery, v. .1, p. 294.

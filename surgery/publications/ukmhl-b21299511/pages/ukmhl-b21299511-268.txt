OMENTAL RUPTURES. 246 a truss. The increased bulk of the part iii old ruptures, and particularly in fat subjects, renders such cases more especially adapted for the treatment by rest and depiction, described in the chapter on irreducible hernias. Although an epiplocele is ordinarily indolent, considerable pressure or violence will cause pain, inflammation, and suppuration, and even gan- grene of the part*. Such effects have been pro- duced by trusses. The inflammation, extending to the cavity of the abdomen, becomes a source of considerable danger. In the most favourable termination an abscess forms, from which pus, with separated portions of the membrane, are discharged. Cases of this description have ter- minated fatally. Of all the parts, which form the contents of hernias, the omentum is found to deviate most frequently from its healthy structure. Indeed it possesses very seldom a perfectly natural appear- ance, when it has been inclosed for some time in a hernial sac. It becomes considerably thickened below the ring, and hence is firmer to the feel. That part which resides in the neck of the sac is * See the three first cases in Mr. Pott's observations on ruptures, in his IVorks, vol. 3. A fatal termination took place in the second, from gangreue of the omentum produced by a tight truss. See also Petit, vol. 2, p. 340—312. Le Dran, Obss. 63. Abnaud, Mem. d« Chirurg. p. 546,

ISCHIATIC RUPTURE. 480 Bertrandi* had seen the ileum protruded on the ridit side in two instances. Cam per f met with an example on the left side of the female pelvis. The opening of the bag was narrow^ and the fundus considerably larger: it contained the ovarium^ which was larger than usual. The fin- ger introduced into the sac could be felt distinct- ly on the outside^ notwithstanding the thick ex- ternal coverings. A case, in which a fatal stran- gulation of the small intestine took place in the same situation, is recorded in Mr. Cooper's ;f work. The swelling was small, and its existence not suspected during the patient's life. rery fat. The swelling resembled an oblong flask, narrowest towards the anus, and increasing below. Its length was an ell, and the circumference of the lower part half an ell. It formed a cavity lined by peritoneum, and containing all the small intestine, with part of the large, and of the omentum. The course of the stomach described a perpendicular line, and the pylorus was at the entrance of the sac in the pelvis. The opening at which the parts protruded, is by no means clearly described. The circumstance of the swelling having been perceptible when small, of its situation near the anus, and of its increase to so great a bulk, make me doubt whether the parts had passed out at the sacro-sciatic foramen.

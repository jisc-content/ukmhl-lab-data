OP TRUSSES. 69 sides, particularly under a slight derangement, which is a very probable occurrence. Moreover, sinct; the force of the spring must be exerted al- most cntii-ely on one spot of the pad, a moderate degree of pressure quickly becomes painful. If the pad be flattened, it applies equally through- out, and the action of the spring is distributed over its whole surface: it will not produce pain, even although the elasticity of the bandage be considerable. A too convex pad may also be injurious, when accurately applied, by pressing the external soft parts into the opening; thus keeping them distended, and preventing that contraction on which a radical cure depends. Its partial and considerable pressure may separate the tendinous fibres near the ring, and thus facilitate a second protrusion. We must not, however, run into thie opposite error of making the pad too flat: eleva- tion in the circumference is not only useless, but actually injurious. Pressure on the spermatic chord would be a probable effect of such a con- struction. When the pad possesses the proper figure, the surgeon must be careful to ascertahi that it exerts an uniform pressure by the whole of its surface. The upper part sitting too closely, al- lows the viscera to escape below; while an undue pressure at the lower part injures the spermatic

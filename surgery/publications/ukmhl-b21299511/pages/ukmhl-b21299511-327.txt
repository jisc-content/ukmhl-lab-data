The gut is necessarily inverted, so that its mucous membrane constitutes the exterior surface of the tumour; which is consequently moistened by the mucous secretion. The colour of the swelling is red. Usually it is not very sensible. It is small at first, becomes gradually larger, and has been seen to exceed a foot in length*. Its size varies, being larger in the erect position, and after exer- tion, and smaller when the subject has been quiet in bed: m the latter state indeed it often disap-t pears.

The tumour increases in size, and becomes livid under such circumstances; and the passage of the feces may be interrapted.

LIGATURE OF THE OMENTUM. 249 gcr arising from the replacement of diseased omentum is further exemplified in an instance related in the tenth volume of the Medical and Physical Journal.* A portion of this organ, described as being of a livid black colour" was returned into the abdomen. Violent inflammatory symptoms, attended with constant vomiting and restlessness, appeared soon after the operation; and every thing indicated the most unfavourable termination. An abscess formed, from which four pounds of matter, together with a sphace- lated portion of omentum, eight inches long and two broad, w ere let out; and the patient reco- vered. Various proceedings have been employed in the management of such diseased pieces of omen- tum, as surgeons have thought it wrong to re- turn. They have placed a ligature on the root of the altered part, removed the substance below this, and then returned the remainder into the cavity of the belly, retaining the ends of the ligature on the outside. It happens too fre- quently in the practice of surgery, that an un- founded fear of hemorrhage causes the ligature to be used under circumstances, where the knife alone would answer every reasonable purpose. It must be some vain apprehension of this kind. * RoBEHTSON, Case of hernia congenita, p. 33.

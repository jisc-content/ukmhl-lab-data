166 ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. The epigastric artery, springing from the ex- ternal ijiac trunk, close to Poupart's ligament, goes behind the spermatic chord, just before that chord enters the abdominal canal. It runs ob- liquely upwards and inwards, on the surface of the peritoneum, precisely along the inner margin of the superior aperture of the ring, and then passes at the distance of half an inch, or an inch, from the upper extremity of the ring of the external oblique, in its course to the posterior surface of the rectus muscle. It is accompanied bv one or two veins : in the former case the vein is between the artery and the pubes*. * For the use of students I subjoin a short direction for the dissection of the parts described in this chapter. After ex- posing the tendon of the obliquus externus at its lower part, and particularly where it forms the crural arch, as well as at its double insertion into the pubes, let a transverse incision be made through it, beginning at the linea semilunaris, about an inch above the situation of the navel, and carried directly out- wards. From the termination of this cut a perpendicular one should be extended to the crista of the ilium 5 and the obli- quus externus should be separated from that part of the bone. The incision must now be continued through the tendon, pa- rallel to the crural arch, and just above it as far as the lower opening of the abdominal canal, leaving that however, entire. By turning the flap, thus separated, over towards the linea alba, we gain a view of the spermatic chord passing between the two openings; of the inferior margin of the obliquus in- terntis and transversus, which are here united into one, cross- ing over the chord to be fixed into the pubes behind the ring;

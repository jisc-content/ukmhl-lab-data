66 CONSTRUCTION AND USE attitudes. This elasticity can be attained only by the employment of steel. In the first at- tempts at procuring something better than the non-elastic bandages, iron was used ; and the in- struments fabricated by Blegny at Paris were constructed of this metal. It is obviously inade- quate to accomplish the ends which we have in view in treating hernias: yet it is only at a com- paratively recent period that its defects have been discovered. Arnaud, whose writings contain much valuable information on this subject;, re- commends for the spring of a truss' a mixture of malleable iron and steel; so that the institimcnt may be moulded by the hand to any particular shape which the patient may require; and he is followed in this point even by Richter. A truss which admits of such management must in effect be exposed more or less to the objections which apply to the non-elastic bandage; and the only material, which possesses the requisite qua- lities of firmness and elasticity, is well tempered steel. The most important part, then, of an elastic- truss consists of a flat and narrow piece of steel, adapted to the form of the body, and called the spring. This passes round the affected side of the trunk, terminates anteriorly on an expanded plate of iron, to which it is rivetted, placed over the mouth of the sac, and extends bchiad to va^

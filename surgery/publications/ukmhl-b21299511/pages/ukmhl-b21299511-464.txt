VENTRAL RUPTURES. tral ruptures occur;, it appears difficult at first to account for their formation. Small bloodvessels and nerves come through the muscles to the in- teguments^ and it has been conceived that the openings^ for transmitting these, when larger than usual, nmy favour the occurrence of herniÂ£e: but this explanation is at best very doubtful. Such apertures are not noticed in the linea alba, where veiitrai herniae usually occur: and, al- though they are numerous in the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus, they are completely shut up towards the abdomen by the muscles situated behind that aponeurosis. These ruptures some- times take place suddenly, from a considerable bodily exertion, and with a sense of laceration, or of something giving way. It is certain that the abdominal muscles are stronolv contracted on such occasions, and we can conceive that some part may be actually torn, so as to give rise to fhe rupture. A case, which I lately examined, clearly proves that such lacerations do occur. A woman, who had been admitted into St. Bartho- lomew's Hospital in December, 1S09, for a strain, caused by lifting a heavy table, died there from an attack of inflammation in the chest. She had complained merely of pain in the loins on her admission. Both the recti abdominis nuiscles were lacerated through about one third of their thickness; and there was a small quantity of

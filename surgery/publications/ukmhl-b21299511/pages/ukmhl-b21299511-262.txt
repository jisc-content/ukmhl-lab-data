240 OPERATION FOR LARGE HERNLl!. reduced without difticulty, and the wound united by the first intention. The advantages of operating without opening the hernial sac are so great in all cases, where the tumour exceeds a moderate size, tliat I itrongly recommend its adoption in all such in- ftances. The honour of proposing this mo^e of ope- rating belongs exclusively to Jean Louis Petit ; and it is merely for the purpose of performing an act of justice to the memory of this very able iurgeon that I add the few following rema,rks. In the first edition of his work on the operations of surgery, published in 1719, Garengeot men- tions a case of crural hernia operated on by Petit without opening the sac, in the preceding year. The latter writer recommends the method in those cases to which it is certainl}^ most applicable, namely, large and adherent hernije.* But he. advises also its more general employment; ex- cepting those cases only in which mortification has occurred, or the parts have become adherent, * Tr. des Mai. Chir. t. 2. Chap, 7. ยง 12. " De I'operatioil quel'on fait aux grosses hernies." This, posthumous work was not published until 1774 3 but as Petit died iu 1750, and has itated in his book that he had operated on liernise in this way more than thirty years before, his claim to originality may be sufticieutly vindicated.

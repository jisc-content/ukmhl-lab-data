STRANGULATED HERNIA. 57 the parts, that they can no longer produce a close constriction. In a small and recent case, the dimensions of the aperture are unimpaired, and its sides are unyielding: strangulation takes place easily,, and the degree of stricture is always considerable. The danger is greatest, when a rupture is in- carcerated at the moment of its formation. Her- nisc, which arise spontaneously, and, as it seems, merely from predisposing weakness, seldom be- come strangulated: the stricture, in such cases, is never close, nor are the symptoms violent, be- cause the parts concerned are weak and relaxed. The opening, through which the parts pro- trude, is narrower in some situations than in others; the progress of the case will therefore be more rapid, and the danger of the patient more urgent. The aperture is generally very small in femoral hernia: this kind of rupture in men, and the bubonocele in women, have a particularly narrow entrance. On the same grounds femoral, inguinal, and umbilical ruptures are more dan- gerous than the ventral, perineal, or vaginal kinds. An enterocele is much more hazardous to the patient than an omental rupture; for the parts are more sensible, and the due performance of their functions is more essential to the support of life.

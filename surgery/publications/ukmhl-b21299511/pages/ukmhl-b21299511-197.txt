ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. 175 The situation of this vessel, in relation to the neck of the hernial sac, is a point on which great variety of opinion has subsisted among surgical w^riters: this may have arisen in some degree from the actual variation in the position of the artepy in the different forrhs of the complaint: but there can be no doubt that the chief cause has consisted in the want of a sufficient number of investigations^ and particularly of the parts, in their altered state. Thus, Richter* supposes that the artery is found near the external angle of the ring, in the diseased, as well as the healthy state of parts; and he supports his opinion by stating, that the vessel was divided in the dead subject by cutting upwards and outwards, iand never, by directing the incisiOn towards the linea alba. It is very clear, that these observations can i.nly apply to the healthy state of parts. Cam- PER-f- has noticed the change of Situation which this vessel undergoes in inguinal hernia:â€”In herniis igifur inguinalibus, arteria et vena epi- *^ gastrica \ersus pubem a prolapsis intestinis " coiupelluntur." Chopart and Desault not only knew the ordinary situation of the artery in bubonocele, but were acquainted with the more uncommon case which will be presently described, * Traite des Hermes, p. 123. f Damonst.

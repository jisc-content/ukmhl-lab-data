OF STRANGULATION. indication is to unload the intestine. The in- flammationj which occurs in the sequel, is a se- condary symptom. The difierences observable in the two very op- posite cases which I have just described, admit of an easy explanation. In the first, the close pres- sure of the ring on the prolapsed parts, in a sub- ject prone to inflammation, causes immediately a violent inflammatory derangement of the abdo- minal viscera. The accumulation of feces, on the other hand, where the parts and the constitu- tion are in a torpid condition, gives to the dis- order the character of a merely mechanical ob- struction. As the description is drawn from the most strongly marked cases, we shall seldom find the difference between the two kinds of strangulation so clearly expressed. The symptoms indeed are often of such a mixed and indefinite nature, that they might be arranged without impropriety mider either of the above species. To the two kinds of strangulation, which I have now described, Richter has added a third, under the epithet of spasmodic, which he con- siders to arise from the action of the external oblique muscle. It does not seem to me that this case is sufficiently characterised, nor that any practical benefit can be derived from the distinc- tion. The following passage will shew what

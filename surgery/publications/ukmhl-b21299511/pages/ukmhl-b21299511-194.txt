172 ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. * Camper, tab. 3, and J2. interno et trans verso abdominis orti, per involn- crum membranaceum sub cute scroti dispersi, quocum velamentum efformant, funiculum sper- maticum et testem undequaque cingens, quod in bcrniosis crassius tenaxque fit, et ex multis sibi iuviccni impositis laraellis constare videtur, cum chirurgia hernias attingimus. Velamentum illud facile a sacco hernias digitis separatur, firmius autem adhaeret vasis spermaficis." Lastly, a full description and representation of the facts are contained in Mr. Cooper's Anatomy and Surgi- cal Treatment of Inguinal and Congenital Hernia. The spermatic chord, since the viscera are protruded directly over it, is placed behind the hernial sac*. If the tumour has descended to the bottom of the scrotum, the chord lies behind it, through its w hole course, and the testis, with its coverings, is in contact with the lower end of the swelling. Where the rupture is not so large, more or less of the chord can be felt between the lower end of the tumour and the testis. I have already described the common covering of the hernia, chord, and testicle, made up of the cre- master muscle and tunica vaginalis of the chord : this is connected universally by cellular adhesions to the parts which it invests, and more closHy to the spermatic vessels than to the sac. The latter

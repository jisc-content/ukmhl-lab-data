CAUSES OF (16 openings through which hernia; generally pro- trude, being tendinous, cannot contract, or dimi- nish in capacity: hence the term stricture, equi- valent to contraction or narrowing, is objection- able. The parts are increased in bulk^ and the ring feels tense, hence it is found to be actually dilated; larger indeed than in health. The term stricture, has led to erroneous practice, to the use of emollients, and such topical remedies as ere supposed to possess the power of relaxing stricture; whereas we should attempt to reduce the bulk of the parts. The tendinous openings then, through which hernias generally protrude, cannot, by their nature, undergo much change; and particularly do not admit of contraction. The protruded parts, however, are capable of considerable enldrgement; and the tendons can produce passively as complete a constrictive effect, as if they had possessed the most unequi- vocal powers of active contraction. A portion of intestine, or omentum, pushed suddenly by a violent effort through the abdoviiinal ring, may be immediately strangulated. A piece of bov^el forced down in an omental rupture, a new por- tion protruded in an old intestinal hernia, or the distension of the contained intestine by its contents, whether of food or air, will so fill up the ring, as to produce incarceration. In all these cases the symptoms cease immediately on

In the male the increasing tumour ext; ids into the scrotum, and forms an oscheocele, or scrotal rupture.* If it is formed in the latter sex, before the communica- tion between the peritoneum and the tunica vagi- nalis testis has been closed, the case is named a hernia congenita; because the disposition of parts, from which this peculiarity arises^ exists at the time of birth. The ruptures, which take place at the inferior aperture of the ring, without passing through its canal, and which, appearing first in the groin, an^ then descending into the scrotum, do not differ in their situation from the above- mentioned inguinal and scrotal hernia?, have not been generally distinguished by any peculiar name. It has been lately proposed to designate these by the appropriate epithet of ventro-ingui- naL The rupture, which occurs through the small opening under the pubic extremity of the crural arch, and manifests itself at the bend of the * While the parts are still in the groin, the hernia has been called incomplete; the epithet, complete, has been given when they have descended into the scrotum, or labia. The distinction is a bad one, since the rupture, in all its essential characters, is as complete in the former case, as in the latter.

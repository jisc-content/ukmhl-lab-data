INCISION OF THE STRICTURE. 205 Those surgeons, who have supposed that thÂ« artery has the same relation to the abdominal ring in the diseased, as in the natural state of parts, direct the incision to be made in a coinse precisely opposite to that abovementioned. Rich- TER* and BfiRTRANDif carrj the knife upwards and inwards, or towards the umbilicus: their ad- vice might be followed in the more rare instances, where the artery is on the outside of the rupture; but would be highly dangerous in the common case, where it runs along the inner margin of the mouth of the sac. The danger increases in pro- portion as the incision approaches to a course di- rectly inwards; and the vessel must inevitably be cut if the knife were guided horizontally towards the liuea alba. Chop art and Desault;]; vary the direction of their incision according to the actual variation in the position of the artery : thuSo thejr justified in concluding, that the artery has often escaped under these circumstances, when we consider that it has been, and still is the general practice, to cut the tendon upwards and outwards, and yet that a wound of the vessel seems to be a most rare occurrence. Mr. Pott must have performed the operation for the strangulated bubonocele a vast number of limes : yet no instance of a division of the artery is recorded in any part of his worka; nor did he mention any such case in his surgical lectures. * Trait*} des Hernies, p, 123. f Traite des Operations, p. 2(). .

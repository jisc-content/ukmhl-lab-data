LIGATURE OF THE OMENTUM. 250 that lias induced operators to tye tlie omeiitiun^ previously to retrenching the diseased part. The consequence of this practice is an inflanimation of the omentum^, extending* within the ahdomcn to the stomach and transverse arch of the colon. This is the circumstance, which, represented in several cases by the best surgical writers, militates so strongly against including the omentum in a ligature; and a case, which I shall presently produce, tends to reprobate it, if possible, still more. What can indeed be more contrary to reason, than the practice, which we are now con- sidering ? The symptoms, which oblige us to operate, arise from the pressure of the ring upon the omentum: no sooner have we freed the part from this stricture, than we subject it to a more close one : for the ligature does what the ring did before; and evidently produces the effect more completely. If strangulation of the omen- tum by the ring may cause dangerous and mortal consequences, how can we expect that these should not follow when the ligature is the cause of stricture ? CASE I.

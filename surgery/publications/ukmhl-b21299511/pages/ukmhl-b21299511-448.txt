426 CONGENITAL HERNIA rcnce of a hernia is very probable, as there is a sac ready formed to receive any protrusion of the viscera; and tlie complaint assnmeSj under these circuu'.stances, the peculiarities which constitute a congenitai rupture. It is still necessary, that the causes, which give rise to herniae, should act in this case as well as in any other; since the mere existence of the communication is not suffi- cient for the production of a congenital rupture. In quadrupeds the tunica vaginalis communicates with the abdomen, and yet protrusions of the viscera are very rare*. In like manner the canal Bomcfimes remains open in the human subject, to even the adult age, without the occurrence of rupture. The term congenital therefore is not applicable to this hernia in its strict sense; as it does not usually exist at the time of birth; it generally appears soon after this period, but it may be delayed, even for many yearsf. It seems probable, that an accidental circum- stance may give rise to the complaint, where it is strictly congenital.

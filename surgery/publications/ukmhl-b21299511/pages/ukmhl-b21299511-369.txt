OF THE FEMORAL RUPTURE. Section II. Anatomical Description of the Femoral Ruflure, This rupture takes place through that space named the crural ring,, which is situated uiidei: " and take out the fat and stnall lymphatic glands from the " femoral sheath internally. I then cautiously made my *' finger pass down the sheath on the inner side of the femoral " vein, and observed where the stricture was the greatest. *' My finger was pushed down till it appeared upon the fascia ** of the pectineus muscle. In this course it would be com- *' pressed chiefly by the sharp edge of the posterior attacb- " ments of Poupavt's ligament, and by the lunated edge of the " fascia lata. These two parts would, by the pressure of my *' finger, be generally made to coincide, as they are in nature " united. My description includes them both, and considers " them as one. With this key you will find my description " not unintelligible. In one part of your criticism, however, you have mistaken my meaning, which certainly is not " clearly expressed. In describing an operation performed *' in 1784, (p. 157) to shew that I had from experience ob- tained some knowledge of the part which forms the stricture " in femoral hernia, though my anatomical knowledge of it *' was very inaccurate, I say, ' The aponeurosis (forming " Pouparfs ligament) consisted of two layers, which were ' separated considerably from each other, when I attempted ' to reduce the intestine, it passed into the cavity formed " between these layers,' &c. I did not mean to say, that the

134 TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED RUPTURES I Operations de Dionis, edit. 5, p. 324, note a. tioii of the symptoms of strangulation, together with those which indicate inflammation in the abdomen, will then require bleeding^, and the other antiphlogistic treatment, until these alarm- ing appearances are removed. It is possible that the rupture may not be completely reduced ; a sir.all portion of intestine may be still included in the stricture. If this keeps up the symptoms, and is irreducible, the operation becomes necessary. ■ A stran2:ulation of the bowels, when re- turned, has been caused by preternatural adhe- sion, or uncommon conformations of the omentum. These occurrences are extremely rare, and can- not possibly be discovered during the patient's life. Lastly, it has been thought possible that the hernial sac may be returned, with its contents, and that its neck, in a thickened and indurated state, may keep up the strangulation. Le Dran * first asserted this in the case of a femoral rup- ture, where he found, on dissection, the sac push- ed into the abdomen, with its contents; and still firmly including them.

He vi- sited me on the fifteenth day with the intelligence that his wife grew better and better, and that she would not be restrained from satisfying her appe- tite : the discharge through the wound was in very small quantity, and took place only when she strained in eypelling the feces. I ordered a clyster, whenever she felt any inclination to go to stool, in order to dilute the feces, and recom- mended that she should exert herself as little as possible in their evacuation. On the twenty- second day I set ofi' on my return to Paris, and found the external wound very nearly healed: the opening in the intestine had, in all proba- bility, entirely closed, as no feces had appeared through it for three days. After the expiration of a month I again saw her in Paris, in a state of perfect health : I recommended a truss, in order to prevent any return of the protrusion, which, however, I do not fear so much in cases like the present, as I do in others*. * Tr. des Mai.

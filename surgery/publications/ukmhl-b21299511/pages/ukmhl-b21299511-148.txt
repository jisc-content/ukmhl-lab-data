TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED RUPTURES. 126 Section III. Blood-ktiing. The use of blood-letting in strangulated her- nia has been very freely adopted^ and warmly recommended by the most celebrated modern sur- geons. The grounds of this practice are de- rived from the state of inflammation which oc- curs sooner or later in the prolapsed parts^ and which is propagated from that source over the whole abdomen. Besides its efl'ects in curing and preventing inflammation^ the state of faiat- ness, which it produces, is said to be peculiarly favourable to reduction. Mr, Pott*^ in this country, has been the most strenuous advocate of venesection, and the high estimation in which his writings are most deservedly held has, no * " Perhaps there Is no disease afFecthig the human body, in which bleeding is found more immediately and eminently serviceable than in this; and which, therefore, if there are no particular circumstances in the constitution prohibiting it, ought never to be omitted; but, on the contrary, should be freely and largely repeated, if it appears at all necessary." Pott s JForks, vol. 2, p. 79. Sharp's advice on this subject- is just the same. Treatise on the Operationsy edit, 10, p. 17.

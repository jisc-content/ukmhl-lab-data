425 IK THE MALE SUBJECT. \\ lien, as it sometimes happens, the commu- nication between the tunica \aij:inalis and the abdomen remains open after birth*, the occur- ninth month, and the communication has closed; but it may be open on one or both sides. Of one hundred and three children, which Wkisberg care- fully examined for this purpose at the time of birth, seventy- three had both testicles in the scrotum ; in twenty-one, one or both were in the groin 3 in twelve, one or both were in the abdomen. In eight of the last division the descent took place within the five first days after birth ; in one it happened in the sixth week j and in the remaining three the testis had not appeared at the fourth or fifth week, when the infants left the hospital. Ju two there was a hernia on the right side.—Commentate soc, reg. Scit'fit. Gotting. 1778« * It should appear, by the observations of Campeb, that the canal of communication is generally open at the time of birth. He dissected seventeen newly born children for the purpose of ascertaining this point. He found the canal open on both sides in eleven of these : it was obliterated entirely on one side, and only in part on the opposite in five; and in one only it was completely destroyed on both sides.—" O71 the i^uuses of tilt; ruptures which occur so frequently iw neiu-Ldrn i hildren," in the Transactions of the Dutch Society of Sciences at Haarlem, v. 6 and 7; in Dutch. These papers are also contained in his Dissertationes edit, a Her bell, 8vo. Lingae, 1800. My own dissections do not agree with this statement j \ have generally found the canal closed at the time of birth, Campkr asserts further, that the canal is closed earlier on the left than on the right side, and explains, from this circum- btance^ the irore frequent occurrence of herniae on the latter jide.

162 ANATOMY OF INGUINAL RUPTURES. rior margin of fhe tendon of the obliquus inter- nils and transversus ; and both are gradually lost above, between the peritoneum and transversus. The posterior surface of this aponeurosis is lined hy the peritoneum. Since this fascia is situated behind the obliquus internus and transversus muscles, the division just described is covered bv these muscles, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the crural arch, where a small part of it appears under their lower margin. This opening gives passage to the spermatic chord and to the round ligament of the uterus; and was first described by Mr. Coo- per, in his work on ini^uinal and congenital hernia. The superior margin of this aperture is formed by the lower edge of the obliquus internui and transversus: which can be felt very distinctly by the finger passed obliquely upwards itnd out- wards through the ring of the external oblique muscle. The other sides of the opening, which are sometimes not very clearly defined, are formed by the fascia transversal is. The spermatic vessels, placed behind the peritoneum, descend from the loins, over the surface of the iliacus internus muscle, connected to it and to the membrane by loose cellular sub- stancfe; and arrive at the division between the two portions of the fascia transversalis.

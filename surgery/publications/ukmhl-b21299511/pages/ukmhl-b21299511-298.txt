276 TREATMENT OF RUPTURES The feces came through the wound, and the pa- tient recovered. " Experience/' he sajs, has " convinced me, that the ligature in the mesen- " tery may be omitted vs^hen the intestine has " opened or is ready to open by mortification ; because the inflammation preceding it always *' produces an adhesion af the intestine." In an instance mentioned by Mr. Cooper*, the intestine was replaced, without being confined by a ligature. The feces made their appearance after ten days; and passed for eleven weeks, partly through the wound, partly per anum; at the end of this time their natural course was re- established. Two other facts, in proof of this point, are furnished by PETiTf; and SharpJ; speaks in general terms of the great number of cases where the feces have been safely discharged through the wound from a gangrened intestine.ยง * Pt.

The feces appeared on the third or fourth day, but took the natural passage very soon after, and the patient recovered : Med. Communications, v. 2, p. 10'^.

ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION 3SG expanded tendon of the psoas parvus*. This fascia is in immediate contact with the muscles; the iliac vesseland the peritoneum cover its anterior surface, and are connected to it by a loose cellular substance. It is attached on the inside to the line which bounds the superior aperture of the pelvis ; on the outside, to the anterior portion of the inner edge of the crista ilii; and below, to the posterior margin of the crural archf. The latter insertion terminates in a jv)inted form just over the passage of the vein. Another part of the fascia is continued over the bone, and behind the artery and vein into the thigh, w here it forms the posterior portion of the sheath, including those vessels, and is continuous with the fascia lata. ' In conseoAicnce of the structure just described the crural arch is firmly confined in its situation, and the protrusion of the abdominal viscera under it is obviated. A small space, however, is left between the iliac vein and the thin border of the tendon, not closed towards the abdominal cavitv, and consequently affording an opportunitv for the occurrence of hernia?. This, which is either filled with cellular substance or an absorbing * It is described by Mr. Coofkr under the name offascia U'lnca. f Here the fascia consists of two layens, with the arterta and vena circumflex^ ilii passhig between them.

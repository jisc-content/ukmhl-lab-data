Where pressure of the cicatrix threatens to hiterrnpt entirely the course of the feces, an attempt at relief should be made by dividing the stricture*. The means, which I have now directed, can be regarded only as palliative; but Desault has accomplished in some instances a radical cure. After procuring the return of the protrusion, he places a plug of linen in the opening, which keeps up the intestine, and, by closing the fis- tula, favours the passage of the feces in their natural course. He endeavours to destroy the angle, formed by the two ends of the intestine, by long pieces of lint introduced into both extremi- ties; which method, by dilating the inferior end, facilitates also the discharge of air or feces. When a sufficient dilatation has been effected, and tlie internal angle is effaced, the long por- tions of lint are laid aside, and the linen plug alone retained, with a caution not to introduce it too far, as it would then constitute an obstacle to the passage of the intestinal contents. If this plan succeed, its effects are indicated by the passage per anum, first of air, and afterwards of feces. as the latter increases, the external open- â€¢ This was successfully practised in an insta.nce recorded by ScnMVCKER^ Chir.

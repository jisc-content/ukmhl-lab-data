OF RUPTURES. 97 belief that these disorders are accompanied with a diiniiuitioii of the sexual powers would increase the desire of a radical cure, and provide, in an age when surgery was imperfectly cultivated, a constant source of imposition to the artifices of unprincipled persons. RiCHTER has hinted at the possibility of ob- taining a radical cure, in a short space of time, by the pressure of a tightly applied truss. Since " inflamed parts contract adhesions when in con- tact, might we not," says he, by means of the " bandage, obtain in most cases a radical cure; em- " ploying it so as not only to compress the neck of the sac, but also to excite inflammation in the " part ? A truss with rather a hard pad should be employed for this purpose, drawn sufficiently " tight to cause pain, and kept on until the pain is considerable, attention being paid to guard " the spermatic chord. I think this would be the most easy and certain method of accora^ plishing a radical cure; and I have strong " reasons for supposing that I have seen several individuals cured in this way/' The imme- labore afflaens subligaculam madefaclat, unde insignes mo- â€¢* lestiae ortum trahunt. Per madefactum enim subligaculuni *' et fortiorem motum cutis inter laborandum Insigniter atte- ritur, et exinde producta vulnuscula tarn nrenti, et acuto ** dolore eos excruciant, ita ut semper operationi se subjiccre, ^uarx) tantis doloribus obnoxii continiio vivere malint." ^reiftag in Hallbri, Disp.

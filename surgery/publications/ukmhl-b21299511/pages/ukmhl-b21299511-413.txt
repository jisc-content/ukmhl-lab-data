SAC OF THE UMBILICAL HERNIA. 391 in question. He thinks it difficult to explain yvhy the protruded viscera should not have the usual covering- in this species of rupture; and he quotes ScHMucKER and Sandifort as having observed a sac in cases of exomphalos. Yet he gives up his own o[)inion to the weight of autho- rity, and concludes that an umbilical rupture, occurring in the adult, is not covered by perito- neum. The erroneous notion, that the viscera are not included in a hernial sac, in the case of exomphalos, has arisen from a mistaken supposi- tion that the umbilical vessels perforate the peri- toneum at the part where they enter the body of the fetus. This error could never have been entertained by a person acquainted with the true structure of the parts, since he must have known that the peritoneum is just as entire here as in any other situation of the abdominal parietes. It does indeed often happen, in con- sequence of that membrane being closely con- nected to the inflected cicatrix of the integuments^ that the distinction between the skin and hernial sac cannot be traced on the front of the tumour; but it is even then most easily discerned in every other part of the circumference. In other cases a hernial sac can be demonstrated over the whol# exomphalos just as clearly as in any other specie* of rupture.

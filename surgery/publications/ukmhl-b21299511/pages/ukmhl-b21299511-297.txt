The appendix cjEci, of which a small spot had sphacelated, Avith its little mesentery considerably loac^ed with fat, so as to give the feel of omentum before the operation, formed the contents of this rupture; and it was replaced without any inci- sion of the stricture, although the opening was very small. The progress of the case, subse- quently to the operation, was favourable in every respect; and the wound had completely cica- trized on the nineteenth day. Amyand* found the appendix casci perfo- rated by a pin in an inguinal rupture. He removed the part, after placing a ligature between the perforation and the intestine; and the patient recovered without any unpleasant consequence. The fifty-ninth observation of Le Dran* is a case in which the intestine gave way on the eleventh day after its replacement in the abdomen. * Philosophical Transactions, v. 39, p. 329, I Observations in Surgery, p. 200. t3

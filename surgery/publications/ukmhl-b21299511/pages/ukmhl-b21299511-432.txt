410 UMBILICAL HERNIA IN INFANTS. cause an inconsiderable deg-ree of pain. The tumour, being- (bus tied, should be covered with lint; over which there should be applied one or two compresses fastened on by a circular ban- dage, which should be secured by means of a scapular J. On the succeeding day a slight swelling of the tumour is perceived, analogous to that which occurs in a poly[)us, after tying its basis, and attended with no pain. On the second day the parts shrink, and the ligature becomes loose : its place should be supplied by another drawn rather more tightly. The application of this second ligature is generally rather more painful from the increased sensibility of the p:arts consequent on the first operation. The swelling now soon loses its colour, and becomes livid and flaccid; and a third ligature entirely intercepts the circu- lation. The part usually falls off about the eighth or tenth day, and leaves a small ulcer, which soon closes under the application of dry- lint. The umbilicus has acquired by this time such a firmness that it does not yield at all to the impulse occasioned by coughing or any other exertion of the abdominal muscles. It is, how- ever, advisable, as a matter of precaution, to con- tinue the use of a circular bandage for the two or three months immediately following the cure, lest the salutary operations of nature, employed at this time in the gradual obliteration of the

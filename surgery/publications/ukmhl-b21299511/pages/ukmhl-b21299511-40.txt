18 CAUSES OP case of straining, a person is said, in common language, to hold his breath ; i. e. he first puts the diaphragm in action by a deep inspiration, and then contracts his abdominal muscles. The vis- cera, compressed by these two forces, escape, wherever an opportunity is allowed,provided their pressure exceeds the resistance offered by the ring, or crural arch. On these principles we can ac- count for the observation concerning the greater frequency of ruptures among the inhabitants of mountainous countries,* with whom opportuni- ties must frequently occur of exerting their strength and activity ; as well as for their being more common in the labouring classes of the community. Other causes, referrible to the same head, arise from the forcible action of the respiratory muscles in the expulsion of the contents of the viscera. Vomiting, straining at stool, and the act of parturition, often produce ruptures. â€¢ In strictured patients I have seen hernias formed gradually, in consequence of the Iiabitual efforti required for the evacuation of the bladder. Crying, and the hooping-cough, are frequent sources of the complaint in children. * Blumenbach has observed this with respect to the Swiss, and to the inhabitants of thp Alps in general.

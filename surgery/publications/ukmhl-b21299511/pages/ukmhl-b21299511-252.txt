230 OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. ter. Moderate pressure on the neck of the sac^ by means of a compress, may promote the agglu- tination of its sides, and prevent any protrusion. The patient, when laid in bed, should be di- rected to avoid most carefully every exertion, on account of the risk of a fresh protrusion. He should therefore lie as quietly as possible. The necessity of straining for the expulsion of the feces will be obviated by the directions given in the subsequent section, concerning the employ- ment of laxative medicines. It will be proper to place a small and soft pillow under the scrotum. Section VI, Treatment after the Operation. The management of the wound requires no particular directions: it is a simple incision through parts of no consequence in themselves, and should be treated according to the ordinary principles of surgical practice in similar cases. If the progress of the case should be favourable, the first dressings need not be removed before the fourth day; after which time the applications may be renewed every twenty-four hours. Where

RUPTURES. 25 are totally inadequate and even ridiculous. In the respectable work of Riciiter, which deserves on the whole much commendation, the orig^in of hernias is attributed to the use of relaxing and aqueous liquors, of fat and oily kinds of food; to moisture of the climate, &c. Fish, and even milk, have not escaped the imputation of favour- ing the formation of these complaints. Hernia, which originate in predisposition, generally come on gradually, and almost im- perceptibly ; while those, which are produced by bodily exertion, are formed suddenly, and by the immediate action of the exciting cause. The occurrence of the complaint is often in- dicated in the first instance by a fulness, com- bined with a sense of weakness and uneasiness about the abdominal ring. The swelling is in- creased by any action of the respiratory muscles, and is therefore rendered more sensible by cough- ing or holding the breath, and disappears on pressure, and in the recumbent position of the body. It gradually finds its way through the tendon of the external oblique muscle into the groin, and afterwards into the scrotum. When a hernia takes place suddenly, it is generally at- tended with a sensation of something giving way at the part, and with pain.

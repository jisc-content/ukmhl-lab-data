17 OP RUPTURES. A general increase in the contents produces a ge- neral yielding of the containing parts^ as in ascites^ tympanites^ or pregnancy : and a similar yielding of all the parietes may occur in a more limited space of the abdomen, constituting a spe- cies of ventral rupture. But neither of these cases comes properly under the description of a hernia. The pressure which the viscera constantly re- ceive from the respiratory muscleSj becomes great- ly augmented by any unusual exertion, w^hich is always attended with a forcible action of the ex- piratory and inspiratory powers at the same time. When such efforts are carried beyond a certain point, the parietes of the cavity give way to the impelling force at those parts where they are weakened by the holes for the transmission of blood-vessels; and the viscera are thrust forth from their situation, carrying before them a por- tion of the peritoneum, which forms the hernial sac. Thus it is that ruptures are frequently pro- duced by the act of lifting or carrying a heavy weighty in running or jumping; in short, under any circumstances where considerable efforts are used. On such occasions the abdominal muscles and diaphragm are called into forcible exertion^ for the purpose of fixing the trunk, and affording a steady point of support to the limbs. In the c

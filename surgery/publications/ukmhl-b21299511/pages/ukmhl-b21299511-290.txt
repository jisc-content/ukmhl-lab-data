We are recommended to leave the gut in the wound, after removing the stricture ; in addition to this, some have advised excision of the mortified part*. Others have returned the intestine, retaining it in the neighbourhood of the ring, by a ligature passed through the mesentery, and confined externally by adhesive plaister.

Two questions here offer themselves for discussion: whether a replaced portion of intes- tine leave the ring, and move to some distant part of the cavity ? and whether, on the separa- tion of the sphacelated part, an effusion into the abdomen may be expected ?

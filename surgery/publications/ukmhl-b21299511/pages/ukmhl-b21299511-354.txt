ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION 332 line*, which bounds the concavity of the ilium, and contributes with it to form the superior aperture of the pelvis. The space under the crural arch contains, besides the parts already enumerated, the anterior crural nerve, and some smaller nerves, which lie on the surface of the psoas and iliac muscles ; the lymphatic truriks of the lower extremity, and one or more absorbing glands. The surface of the bone between the spine and angle forms the basis of the triangle described by the inferior aperture of the abdominal canal; it is covered by the spermatic chord in the male, and by the round ligament of the uterus in the- female subject. The attachment of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle to the os innominatum has been described already in the account of the inguinal hernia: it only remains for me to state more minutely some particulars concerning this part. It is fixed by a broad insertion into the pubes; this attachnjcnt, which begins at the spine, runs along the crista of the bone. Its po- sition therefore (in the erect state of the body,) is nearly though not entirely horizontal; conse- quently its two margins should be described by * Sometimes called linea imiominata: the tendon of the psoas parvus is inserted into it.

130 TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED RUPTURES. Messrs. WiLMER and Alanson iu declaring, that blood-letting has generally failed to procure the return of a strangulated intestine, although he does not a^ree with them in their universal repro- bation of its employment. One advantage is certainly derived from ve- nesection, although it should prove inadequate to the intended object of its employment, viz. that, by checking inflammation, it keeps the dis- order stationary, and is therefore attended with no loss of time. It is hardly necessary for me to observe, that the conduct of the surgeon cannot be regulated in these cases by the state of the pulse; the pain and tension, and other symptoms will justify hira in employing or repeating this evacuation, where the pulse is weak, and not beyond its natural fre- quency. Neither should he be deterred from using the lancet by coldness of the extremities, pale couu- ienance^ and weak respiration: since these are ordinary symptoms of inflamed bowels : and the experienced surgeon knows that venesection will raise the pulse, restore warmth to the limbs, and apparently strengthen the patient. In order to obtain all the advantaare, which can be derived from blood letting, we are directed to continue it until fainting is produced ; and to attempt reduction at that time. This precept rviust be received with some allowance. Syncope

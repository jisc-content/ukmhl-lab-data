SOS INCISION OF THE STRICTURE. point, at wliicli tlie incision of the tendon should be made, is at the middle of the superior margin of the ring; the artery can never be situated at this part, nor be exposed to danger unless the incision be extended to a most unreasonable length. When the stricture is in the superior orifice of the ring, the epigastric artery is invariably found on the inner margin of the aperture; and cannot therefore be injured by carrying the incision towards the spine of the ilium; nor does the practice of cutting directly upwards expose it to any risk. The instruments to be employed in dividing the stricture, and the manner of using them are nearly the same as when the tendon of tiie external oblique causes the incarceration. The bistoury recommended by Mr. Cooper, which has a cutting edge extending only to a certain distance from the pointy should be em- ployed for this purpose. It must be introduced with the flat side towards the finger, until the probe point has passed under the stricture, when it may be turned up so as to bring its edge in contact with the margin of the transvcrsus, and to divide that muscle to the required extent. The protruded parts may be strangulated, both in the upper and lower openings, at the same time, so as to require an incision in both these situations for thÂ«ir complete liberation. Hence the division

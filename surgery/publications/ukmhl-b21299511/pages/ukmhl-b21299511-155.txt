PURGATIVES. • 133 nfation under which Mie parts already labour. HencG the most approved surgical writers* of the present day prohibit their employment in cases of that description. In old and large hernije, where an accumulation of fecal matter, from torpor of the intestine, is the cause of strangulation, and the symptoms are of the chronic kind, purgatives may be employed with success. If vomiting has already appeared, it may be allayed by opium and the elTervescing draught, so as to allow a fair trial of the purgative. The most violent remedies of this description are not al- ways the best in such a case. Epsom salt, dis- solved in a large quantity of water, and exhibited in small and repeated doses, gently excites the action of the parts, and is preferable to the more drastic purges. Opium may be combined with this remedy, to make it sit better on the stomach. RicHTERf commends the combined employment of purga- tives and opium, and praises highly, from his own experience, the following formula. Melt an ounce of Epsom salt in five ounces of infusion of camomile flowers; add two ounces of linseed * Pott's Works, vol.

SYMPTOMS OF 34 mation of the protruded viscera causes a thick- ening of their coats, an effusion of fluid into t]ie hernial sac, and adhesions of the parts to each other, and to the containing bag. When it is particularly violent, a layer of coagulating lymph is sometimes thrown out on the surface of the iutestine. A manifest impression is often made on the intestine by the stricture, and this may proceed so far as to cause a considerable constric- tion of the canal.* It terminates at last, unless the stricture be previously removed, in gangrene. ThesCj which we may call the 'primary effects of the incarceration, are accompanied by other symptoms, arising from disorder of the parts^ which sympathise with the hernia. In an incarcerated intestinal rupture, the tumour, which was before indolent, becomes painful; the pain is most acute at the strictured portion, and extends from that situation over the rest of the swelling and abdomen; these parts becoming at the same time swoln and tense. A * In a patient, who died with insuperable constipation, and all the Symptoms of ileus, I found the small intestine sur- rounded at one point by a preternatural adhesion, consisting of a firm and roundish cord. The canal was here perma- nently contracted, so as not to exceed a large quill in diameter. Mr. RiTSCH found it completely closed, in a case of hernia. Mem. de I'Acad, de Chirurg. t. 4.

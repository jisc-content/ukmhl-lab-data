\ COaNSTRUCTION AND USE In order that a ruptured person may derive all the benefit which a truss can afford, and avoid as ^much as possible the inconveniences <:onnected with ifs use^ care should be taken^ that the spring be constructed of a due strength; that the instrument sit close in every part, so as not to make any partial or irregular pres- sure; that it be not deranged by the necessary motions of the bodv; and that the form of the pad be adapted to the part on which it lies.

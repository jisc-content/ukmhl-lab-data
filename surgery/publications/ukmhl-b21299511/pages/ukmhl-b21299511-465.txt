TENTRAL RUPTURES. 443 coagulated blood about the torn fibres. The sheath was not at all ruptured*. Penetrating wounds of the abdomen are gene- rally followed by ruptures. A case of this kind is related at p. 23: and, in an instance observed hy Mr, \V AuoRopf, where a piece of wood had penetrated the cavity half way between the spi- nous process of the ilium and the pubes^ an onterocele of six inches in length by four in breadth, with very thin coverings, and easily reducible^ took place. It has been asserted that abscesses in the muscles are followed by ventral ruptures^: blows too seem to have produced them in some instances. They could hardly occur in the situation of the recti, or where the abdomen is covered by the three broad muscles at the side, without some previous injury to the parts, as from a wound. The distension of the belly in pregnancy is favourable to the occur- rence of ventral herniae ; and particularly to that * There is a case in the Parisian Journal, in which the peritoneum and abdominal muscles were torn across for the space of three inches by a fall from a considerable height, v. 1, p. 366. f Cooper, pt. 2, p. 60. + " A regard des abces, pour qu'apres leur guerison, ils laissent une disposition ^ la hernie, il faut que la maliere " qui les forme, se trouve logee entre le peritoine et Ics muscles. J'ai vu deux fois ce cgs, et I'un et I'autre ^ la suite des grossesses," Petit, lib, cit. p. 259.

450 HERNIA OF THE BLADDER. iial and vaginal rupture of the same subject,* and in a bubonocele on both sides of the bodyt It is necessary to the occurrence of a cystocele, that the bladder should be placed immediately behind, or very close to the ring; and that it should hold that situation when empty : for the distended condition of the organ is obviously so very unfavourable to a protrusion, that it can hardly be deemed possible in that state. Re- peated distensions of the bag from any cause must therefore be regarded as particularly dis- posing to this kind of rupture: and the lateral extension of the viscus in pregnancy facilitates its occurrence. We often discover the blad- der on dissection adhering, in such cases, to tlie back surface of the abdominal muscles, instead of having its fundus behind the pubes. These causes however exist in abundant instances, without giving rise to hernia of the bladder ; and the latter complaints cannot, in many cases, be traced to any causes of the nature now al- luded to. t Lev RET, obs, sur les polypes-, p. 145 : quoted in RicH- THB, tr. des hern, ch.

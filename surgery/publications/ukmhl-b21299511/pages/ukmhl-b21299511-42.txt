20 CAUSES OF clcs forming a broad concave surface;, ^vhich shuts up the front anel sides of the pelvis at this part, and whicli, by replacing the viscera when protruded bj the pressure of straining, constitutes an antagonist power to the respiratory muscles. A strong fascia, continued from the arch of the pubes to the prostate and neck of the bladder, prevents protrusions in that situation; and the bladder and rectum afl'ord a considerable obstacle to the formation of ruptures in this neighbour- hood. A descent of the viscera through the great sciatic notch, is 'almost entirely precluded by the space being so occupied by the pyri- formis muscle, and the vessels and nerve which go through the opening. The predisposing cause of ruptures has been referred to a naturally greater size of the openings at which they protrude; to a weakness and re- laxation of the margins of these apertures; and to a preternatural laxity of the peritoneum.* The former circumstance has probably a chief opera- tion; since in males, where the abdominal ring * " Cette foiblesse, cause prcdisposante des hernies, con- " siste, ou en une laxity centre nature du Peritoine, qui, dans " les endroits, ou il n'est pas soutenue par les muscles du *' bas-ventre, comme ^ I'anneau, cede k la distension : ou en un relachement et une extensibilite centre nature du m^s- * entere, et de toutes les parties, qui maintiennent les visceres " du bas-ventre dans leur situation."

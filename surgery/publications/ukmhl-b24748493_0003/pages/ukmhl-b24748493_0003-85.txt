75 SCARLET FEVER. the strength of the individual allows or the severity of the disease re- quires. This produces a soothing and refreshing feeling, followed soon by an eruption, vivid in colour and astonishing in amount, the surface of the body being, after the bath, " dabbed," not rubbed, dry. This practice ho has followed for fifteen years without losing a single patient, and he asserts that contagion is thereby avoided. During convales- cence the temperature of the bath, used daily or every other day, is gradually reduced. Bramwell (' Brit. Med. Journ.,' 1870, ii, 30) affirms that local bleed- ing is highly beneficial in acute scarlet-fever dropsy. Out of nineteen cases he lost but one, and he gives reports of the cases of five boys, between the ages of five and eleven, in whom he asserts recovery to have followed this treatment. Thomas ('Jahrb. f. Kinderheilk.,' t87o, iv, 60) gives an interesting case of scarlet fever, in a boy aged about five years, characterised by the existence of normally pale skin between the several hyperasmic spots of scarlatina variegata and the appearance of an intense and characteristic second exantliem. In the 'Brit. Med. Journ,' (1869, ii, 659) will be found a summary of Yirchow's remarks, at the forty-third meeting of German naturalists and physicians at Innsbruck, on the various forms of kidney affection after scarlet fever, and on "casts" generally. He distinguishes two forms of scarlatinal nephritis—the first the catarrhal, characterised by the proliferation of the epithelial cells in the tubes of the medullary substance, similar to that taking place in catarrhal pneumonia; the second the parenchymatous form, in which changes and degeneration of the cells occur, without proliferation, commencing in the cortical substance, near the Malpighian glomerules. He has ceased to recog- nise a third form, the croupous, since he has convinced himself that there is no disease of the kidneys characterised by a peculiar kind of fibrinous casts ; the latter might possibly be formed in the tubes by the contact of albuminates of soda with a solution of salts, and their pre- sence is indicative only of a change in the kidneys, not of its quality or intensity. Behn (' Jahrb. f. Kinderheilk.,' ii, 439) gives a case in which the in- cubation-period was at most 48, probably only 24 hours in duration.

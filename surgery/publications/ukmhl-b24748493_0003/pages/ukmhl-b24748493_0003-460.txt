450 REPORT ON MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. spinal motor nerves and on the cardiac inhibitory branches of the vagi. The paralysing action, though resembling that of atropia in character, differs greatly from it in degree. Yon Planta and Kekule have shown* that conia, as obtained from conium maculatum, is a variable mixture of two bases, to which they give the names ' conia' and ' methyl-conia.' These bases resemble one another very closely in physical properties. Their composition is represented by the formula? C8H15N and C9H17N. The chemists above named investigated the action of iodide of ethyl upon conia, and proved that ' conia' (or, as it is called by Brown and Fraser, normal conia) is an imide base, and that ' methyl-conia' is a nitrile base. The elabo- rate experiments of Christison,t Schroff,J Von Praag,ยง Kblliker,|| and Guttmann,^[ have rendered important service to our knowledge of the effects and mode of action of conia. The authors had the great advan- tage of working with a sample of the original conia with which Chris- tison had experimented in 1835, as well as with samples procured from three different manufacturers. It is known that conia is a poison of great activity, and that it produces marked paralytic and less obvious spasmodic symptoms. The former symptoms have been shown to depend principally upon an action on the peripheral terminations of the motor nerves, but the causation of the latter is as yet unknown. It has also been ascertained, chiefly by the investigations of Kolliker and Gruttmann, that conia does not directly influence the functions of the sensory nerves, striped muscles, or heart. The experiments under notice confirm, in a general manner, the above results ; but they also show that considerable differences occur both in the nature of the action and in the lethal activity of various samples of conia. Christison's conia, and a sample obtained from Mr. Morson, presented the most marked differences, and their action is alone described. The difference of activity between the hydrochlorate of Christison's conia and that of Morson was so great, that while two tenths of a grain of the former speedily caused death in a full-grown rabbit, this dose of the latter did not produce any distinct effect, one grain being the smallest fatal dose for a rabbit. The symptoms produced in mammals by the different samples were very similar in character. The more prominent of these were stiffness of the limbs, causing difficulty in moving about; spas- modic starts ; distinct increase of reflex excitability ; gradually increas- ing paralysis, with diminution and afterwards disappearance of the in- creased reflex excitability ; and, finally, death by asphyxia. The exact causation of the paralytic symptoms differed, however, in a remarkable manner in different samples of conia. An extended series of experi- ments was undertaken to elucidate the causes of these striking dif- ferences. It was found that conia and methyl-conia produce very similar symptoms, the more prominent of which are spasms and paralysis. It * 'Ann. d. Chem. u. Pharm.,' lxxxix, p. 129. t 'Trans. Roy. Soc.

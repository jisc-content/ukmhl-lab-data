Gueneau de Mussy ('Union Med.,' vii, 99) in his clinical lectures on chronic diarrhoea, discusses its treatment by different drugs. In cases where the stools contain masses of slime, he lays great weight upon injections containing nitrate of Bilver (p. 142). The best method of administration, according to him, is to dissolve about '15 or '20 centigr. in about 20 grms. of water, and inject it into the rectum through a glass syringe, and follow it up with a large quantity of distilled water, the operation being repeated every day or two. Simon fib., 725) gives a rare case of diarrhoea in a South American woman of 55, which had lasted twenty years, and had been treated without success in all sorts of ways in America and France. After taking on a choleraic form it was cured in one month by sulphate of quinine, in Feb. 1862. In April of the same year the patient had a relapse; and again in 1864, '5, '7, and '8, quinine, after other drugs had failed, bringing about recovery as before. There could be no possible doubt that it was originally caused by miasmatic poison. Ferrand ('Bull. Gen. de Therap.,' t. 77, p. 20) records a case of the same kind occurring in a soldier, set. 42, in the Papal service, which, after lasting nine months and treated in every way, was suddenly cured by sulphate of quinine, suggested by the preceding paper. Tartivel ('Union Med.,'vii, 281) publishes at length two cases of obstinate chronic diarrhoea, cured by cold douches combined with hot- air baths. He gives shortly three other cases, treated in the same way, and is earnest in suggesting that death, which followed later in two of these, from cerebral softening and haemorrhage, had nothing to do with the good results obtained by the water treatment of the diarrhoea. Siredey (ib., 75) gives the case of a man, aet. 41, who presented symp- toms of internal strangulation, which disappeared on the expulsion, per rectum, of a large quantity of intestinal mucosities. He had severe tenesmus, prolapsus ani, hypera>sthesia, and neuralgia in different parts; relieved by enormous doses of morphia injected subcutaneously, 0*5 centigr. in twenty-four hours. There was great wasting and loss of strength. These attacks, relieved by the passage of mucous, gelatinous concretions, or matter resembling false membranes, seem to have lasted

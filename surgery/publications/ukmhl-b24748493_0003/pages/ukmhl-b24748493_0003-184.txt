174 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. (6) Internal strangulation; of seventeen cases, it was produced in— («) Six cases by a peritoneal band generally connected at one end with the mesentery, or by matting together of peritoneum. (b) Three, by a band derived from the omentum, or the margin of an aperture in that membrane. (c) One, by an arch formed, by the mesentery, of a coil of ileum descending into the pelvis. (d) One, by the pedicle of an ovarian tumour. (e) One, by a band or bands connected with the vermiform appendix. (/) Pive, by a diverticulum from the ileum, with a band attached to its extremity. ((/) One, by the neck of an internal hernial pouch. (h) One, quoted from the ' Path. Soc. Trans.,' formed by injury or disease in the abdominal parietes. In the earlier portion of the paper he discusses the general diagnosis of the seat of the obstruction, more especially the scantiness or sup- pression of urine, in obstruction of the small intestine, to which Barlow (' Guy's Hosp. Rep.,' s. 2, ii, 367) first drew attention.

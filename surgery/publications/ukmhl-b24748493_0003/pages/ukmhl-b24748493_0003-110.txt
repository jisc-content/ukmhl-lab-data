Pairbank"(' Med. Times and Gaz.,' 1869, ii, 506) describes a rash resembling that of scarlet fever, appearing in a man set. 28, on the eleventh day of the acute stage of rheumatic fever 5 it was followed next day by an abundant crop of miliaria, which lasted for three or four days, and was accompanied by very great prostration; the treat- ment consisted of Vichy water and opium, which on the appearance of the eruption was changed to gentian and ammonia. Virchow (' Archiv,' xlvii, 298) found well-marked arthritis deformans in several bones dug out of a monastery in Pomerania, especially in a humerus, in which both fossse, particularly the posterior, were filled with osteophytes, and in a lumbar vertebra, the foramen of which was so narrowed that he thinks there must have been paraplegia (lie draws attention to this cause of the latter affection, often overlooked from the way in which the spinal canal is opened) ; there was an axis also slightly affected. These bones must date between 1356 the foundation, and about 1550, the demolition of the monastery. Cf. his account of the bones from a Hun tomb in Pomerania (' Yerhandlung der Berlin.

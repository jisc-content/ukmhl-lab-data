OPERATION STATISTICS. 8£5 extending over a period of seventeen years, are given by Mr. Birkett. Dr. Steel gives those of the eight years from 1861-8, embracing 305. (' Guy's Hosp. Eep.,' xv, pp. 562 and 600.) Mr. Hester has published the results of amputations in his practice at the Badclifte Infirmary, Oxford, in tho 'Brit. Med. Journal,' April 3, 1869. The total cases were fifty-two, with six deaths. Statistics of operations in country and hospital practice are given by Sir James Simpson in ' Edin. Med. Journal,' i and ii, 1869, showing the influence of hospitalism. Mr. Teale gives statistics of the relative mortality attending the employment of rec- tangular and non-rectangular flaps. ('Lancet,' July 16, 1870.) Prof. Spence read before the Med.-Chir. Soc. of Edin. an account of the statistics of 403 amputations performed by himself. They are tabulated in the 'Edin. Med. Journ.,' Sept. 1870. Mr. Nunneley gives the statistics of the operations performed in the Leeds Infirmary during a period of sixteen years. ('Lancet,' Jan. 29, Eeb. 5, and Eeb. 12, 1S70.) Dr. Morton publishes the statistics of the Pennsylvania Hospital, as regards operations, for forty years. (' Amer. Journ. Med. Sciences,' Oct. 1870, p. 313.) Mr. Callender gives statistics of the results of amputations on country patients admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and shows that the per-centage of deaths is not greater in large town hospitals than in the country. The mortality after all amputations, in country hospitals, he gives as 1 in 5*7, or 17*5 per cent.; of country cases in London, 1 in 5*8, or 17 per cent.; of country private practice, 1 in 5*8, or 17*1 per cent. ('St. Barth. Hosp. Eep.,' v, p. 243-63.) A review of this paper appeared in the 'Brit. Med. Journ.,' July 24, 1869, in which attention was called to the probable fallacy that the " country patients " in St. Bartholomew's were operated on for disease, and not for severe injuries, thus giving a too favorable return in proportion to more severe cases at other hospitals. Mr. Callender, in the number for Oct. 30, gives the particulars of the cases. He gives the proportion of primary to other amputations as 1 in 7-2 amongst the country cases, and of 1 in 7^4 of primary to other amputations in the gross number. No one of the amputations among country patients appears to have been primary of the thigh. Hospital efficiency.—A summary of recent statistics and statements on this subject will be found in two able articles in the ' Med.-Chir. Eev.,' April, 1870, p. 441, and July, 1870, p. 54. Use of the ligature.—Mr. Callender brings forward statistics showing the rarity of secondary haemorrhage at St. Bartholomew's after the use of the ligature. (' Clin. Soc. Trans.,' iii, p. 111.) Excision of the wrist.—Five cases of successful excision of the wrist- joint are detailed by Mr. West. Eigures of each patient are given and a fac-simile of the handwriting of one of them after operation. (' Dub. Quart. Journal,' Eeb. 1870.)

DIABETES. 95 paralysis of the internal muscles of the right eye, and persistent dia- betes, with death occurring in six years. A somewhat rare case of recovery, in a diabetic patient, from a sur- gical operation is given by Demarquay ('Gaz. des Hop.,' 1869, 1^2). A man, set. 32, had phimosis, brought about by the urinary irritation. The necessary means were resorted to, and the wound healed by the first intention. Schmitz ('Berl. Klin. "YVoch.,' 1869, 344) gives two cases in which he found favorable results from employing the spring at Neuenahr. The first was that of an elderly gentleman, who, before commencing the treatment, was passing 9000 cm. of urine in the twenty-four hom-s, having a sp. gr. of 1040, and containing 5-5 per cent, of sugar. He drank three times early in the morning 6 oz. of the spring water, the same quantity at 10 a.m. and at 5 p.m. This quantity was gradually in- creased, so that after three weeks he was taking 30 oz. before breakfast, 36 oz. at 10 a.m., and 30 oz. at 5 p.m. The diet was that generally employed in diabetes, a French roll for breakfast, and a glass of good old Bordeaux at his mid-day and evening meals. After about thirty- eight days of this treatment not a trace of sugar could be found, and the general symptoms were much improved; in eight weeks he increased in weight 15 lb. In the second case, a man, sat. 23, the sugar did not disappear altogether, but sank from 6 per cent, to per cent.; the sp. gr. from 1040 to 1020; and there was an increase of body-weight of 4 lb. ^ Brouardel ('Gaz. des Hop.,' 1869, 451) recommends Vichy and Carlsbad waters, but adds nothing new. Basham ('Brit. Med. Journ.,' 1869, i, 323) gives four cases, in men whose ages ranged between 36 and 71, and in whom the general symptoms were diminished, the amount of sugar reduced, and the body- weight increased, by perseverance in the employment of alkalies, especially of ammonia and its phosphate, with a moderately restricted diet. Day ('Lancet,' 1869, i, 396) treated a man, sat. 57, successfully with the ethereal solution of the peroxide of hydrogen ; it was administered m drachm doses for three months, and in this time the quantity of urine passed fell from eleven to five pints, and the sp. gr. from 1045 to 1024. He increased 15 lb. in weight. No mention is made of the amount of sugar at any time. Pavy (ib.,ib., 538), in opposition to the last author (ib., 1868, i, 45), found both the aqueous and ethereal solutions of the peroxide without the slightest benefit. On the other hand ('Brit. Med. Journ,,' 1869, 1, 36% he gives three cases in which opium was used with great success â€¢ the first, that of a woman sat. 68, seems to be vitiated to some extent by the administration, " by misunderstanding," of a draught containing bicarbonate of potash, ammonia, and calumba, alongside of the simple treatment (Cf. * Guy's Hosp. Rep.,' xv, 420). Dickinson ('Brit. Med. Journ.,' 1870, i, 219; 'Lancet,' 1870, i, 269; read before the Medical and Chirurgical Society a paper "On certain Morbid Changes in the Nervous System associated with Diabetes,' in which he described the pathological appearances in

THE OPHTHALMOSCOPE IN DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 119 Andrews (' Amer. Journ. of Insanity,' xxv, 359) gives the following: —A boy, tot. 15, had been perfectly well, up to an attack of typhoid fever in April, 1868. During recovery he did not regain flesh, and began to give evidences of great mental disturbance in a marked change of disposition and conduct. Some time after his admission into an asylum he complained suddenly of headache and pain in the stomach, became convulsed with opisthotonos, more maniacal, and then quieter, and died suddenly without further convulsions. The autopsy showed the subarachnoid-cavity filled with a thin layer of blood, and the vessels of the pia mater much congested; the haemorrhage was most abundant at the base of the brain; the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles were tilled with blood-clots and liquor sanguinis. The cerebral substance appeared normal in colour and consistence, but the microscope revealed advanced degeneration of the walls of the blood-vessels. Johnston, " Case of Hydrocephalus," ' Dubl.

Times and Gaz.,' 1869, ii, 14) appears to have come to the following conclusions :—(1) Diseases of the spinal cord, as acute myelitis, spinal sclerosis, locomotor ataxy, &c, frequently induce a congestive lesion of the optic disc, which at a later period becomes atrophic. (2) The lesions of the optic nerve produced by dis- ease of the cord are the result of a reflex ascending congestive action, the great sympathetic nerve acting as the medium between the two. (3) The presence of hyperemia of the optic nerve, of a reddish suffu- sion, or of a total or partial atrophy of the disc, coinciding with weak- ness and numbness of the lower extremities, indicates the existence of an acute or chronic disease of the spinal cord.

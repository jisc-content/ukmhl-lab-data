32 REPORT ON PHYSIOLOGY. those who are interested in such a suhject to a valuable paper by Dr. Nicholson* on the relation of the body weight, and excretion of urea in fasting, as observed amongst prisoners. M. Thudichumf describes a new acid, the kryptophanic, which he lias found to be a constant constituent of tbe urine; it is transparent, non- crystallisable, soluble in water, less so in alcohol, and still less in ether. *E. SchunckJ gives tbe details of a process by which the presence of a fatty acid and of oxaluric acid can be demonstrated in the healthy urine of man. Jaffe§ obtains a new pigment common to the urine and the bile, to which he has given the name of urobilin, characterised by its remarkable fluorescence when chloride of zinc is added to its alkaline solution. . H. Struve|| found that, in patients who had taken large doses oi iodide of potassium, only about 65 per cent, was eliminated by the urine and saliva, the rest being probably excreted by the intestinal mucous membrane, and that all was eliminated in the course of from ninety-two to ninety-seven hours. M. Peyrani^ endeavours to show the influence of the sympathetic nerve on the secretion of urine. His experiments were made on many dogs and rabbits, and on a few cats, with the following results: the quantity of urine and of urea is increased in proportion to the strength of the currents, whether continuous or induced, passed along the sym- pathetic in the neck, though the latter are relatively much more ener- getic in their action. Section of the sympathetic reduces the secretion to a minimum, but an augmentation occurs on stimulating the pen- PhThe works on development have been comparatively few in number. Those of Truman,** His, Dursy, Schenk, Goette,tt and Parker,** are the most important. AIDS TO RESEARCH.

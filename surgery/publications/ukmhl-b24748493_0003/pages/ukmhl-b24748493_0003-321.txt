311 OVARIOTOMY STATISTICS. Vaginal ovariotomy.—Dr. Thomas records a case in which he removed a small ovarian tumonr through the vagina, f Amer. Journ. Med. Sciences,' April, 1870, p. 387.) Ovariotomy at an early age.—Mr. Bryant has performed ovariotomy on a girl of fourteen years of age, in whom the tumour had developed in six months. The patient recovered. (' Guy's Hosp. Reports,' xiv, p. 216.) Ovariotomy statistics.—In the ' Med.-Chir. Review,' Jan. 1869, will be found a detailed table of 111 cases in which Mr. Baker Brown per- formed ovariotomy, compiled from his work ; a summary of the results obtained by Mr. Bryant and Mr. Spencer Wells ; and, lastly, a table of results of 244 cases. From the latter it is seen " that the mortality per cent, is least during the first quinquenniad; that it rises up to 26, when it becomes pretty stationary until the age of 51, with the marked exception of the quinquenniad 41 to 45, and then falls until the age of 60." From 15 to 20 there were 17 recoveries and 4 deaths (icp'o^ per cent, deaths). From 21 to 25 there were 20 recoveries and 7 deaths (23-92 per cent.); then till 41 about 33 per cent, of deaths, and from 41 to 45, 28 per cent. From 51 to 55 there were 17 recoveries and 4 deaths, as in the first quinquenniad. The greatest number of opera- tions occurred between 31 and 35 ; of 123 cases in which the adhesions were slight, death occurred in 34; of 100 cases in which the adhesions were firm, death followed in 38 ; that is, 27-64 per cent, against 38 per cent. In the ' Edin. Med. Journ.,' Oct. and Dec. 1868, and May and June, 1869, Mr. Thomas Keith narrates 14 cases of ovariotomy, which were all successful and all in succession. In the number for March, 1869, it is stated that Dr. Keith mentioned to the Med.-Chir. Soc. of Edin. that he had had 84 ovariotomies, with 70 recoveries and 14 deaths. Of the last 25 all had recovered but one. In the ' Lancet' for Aug. 20, 1870, the same operator gives details of a second series of 50 cases, the first series having been published in the 1 Lancet' for Sept. 7, 1867. In the first 50 the mortality was 22 per cent.; in the second ^o, 16 per cent. Five other cases operated on since have recovered. Of the 100 cases recorded, 81 recovered. No case was operated on in a hospital. Mr. "Wells tabulates his recent cases of ovariotomy in ' Med. Times and Gaz.,' Sept. 3, 1870. In his early experience he had a smaller mortality among hospital patients than in private, then the results were equal. During the last two years the advantage has been on the side of private patients. During the last two years he had operated on 47 cases in hospital, with a mortality of 40 per cent. In private he had operated on 57 patients, with a mortality of 24 per cent., which com- pnred with the 40 per cent, in hospital, is a startling difference. Mr. Spencer Wells has contributed his third series of 100 cases of ovariotomy to the 1 Med.-Chir. Trans.' (lii, p. 197). He states the re- sults to have been—of the first 100, 34 died and 66 recovered; of the second 100, 28 died and 72 recovered ; of the third 100, 23 died and 77 recovered.

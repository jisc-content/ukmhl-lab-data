We take 10 as the convex spherical lens, to which a cylindrical is to be added, and proceed as follows: The reciprocal of 8| is 0-114,285,714 I, 10 ,, O" 100,000,000 The remainder 0-014,285,714 is the reciprocal of 70; and hence a plano-convex cylinder of 70, added to a plano-convex spherical of 10, will be the combination required. Let us suppose also a case in which there is ^ of manifest and I of total hypermetropia, and in which it is desired that the spectacles first ordered should correct the whole of the manifest and one fourth of tlio latent defect The reciprocal of 7 is 0-142,857,143 1, 24 â€ž 0 041,666,667 The remainder 0-101,190,476 which gives, as the latent hypermetropia, something intermediate be- tween 9I and 10, but nearer to the former. Dividing the remainder by 4, we obtain 0-025,297,619, or nearly the reciprocal of 39. If we add this to the reciprocal of 24, the sum is 0-066,964,286, a little more than the reciprocal of 15, and less than that of 14^. In such a case wc may always prescribe somewhat in excess of the calculated strength, and may give a glass of 141 or 14 as one that corrects the whole of the manifest and one fourth of the latent defect. _ Dr. Schobbens gives other examples, which it is not necessary to cite, since the practical applications of the table cannot fail to suggest them- selves to all who may possess it. Eeuss* laid before the Heidelberg Congress the results of ophthalmo- metry measurement of thirty-one eyes from which cataract had been ex- tracted, with reference to the resulting astigmatism. In twenty-three cases measurements were taken before and after operation ; in eight only after. Some degree of astigmatism was found in all, but it underwent diminution up to about five or six months ; and the degree depended to some extent on the character and position of the section. Woinowf communicates the results of ophthalmometric measure- ments of the curvatures of the crystalline lens. The observations were made in Helmholtz's laboratory, with solar instead of with arti- ficial light. The result was to show a greater increase of convexity of the posterior curvature of the lens during the accommodation eft'ort, than had been heretofore supposed to take place. Dr. Monnik,J whose endeavours to improve instruments for the estimation of ocular tension are well known, describes the latest im- provements in his tonometer. The instrument is in the form of a watch, from which project two stems, one of which terminates iu a sort of fork of two extremities, about eight millimetres apart. The other stem terminates in a single extremity, which comes into line with the other two, and is placed half way between them. The operator presses the extremity of the central stem against the eye to be examined until * ' Klinische Monatsblatter,' 1869. f Ibid. X ' Arch. f. 0.,' Avi, 1, p. 49.

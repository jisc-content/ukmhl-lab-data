Fergusson calls attention to the proper treatment of the enlarged prostate during lithotomy. He says that, in many instances, as the finger passes towards the bladder, the sensation is as if its point glided through several round bodies in the substance of the gland, which are but slightly connected with one another. "When the stone is being extracted, within the grasp of the forceps, there is often considerable resistance, even when the knife and forefinger have been freely used to give passage to and from the blad- der. In some instances the stone, whilst all but through the wound, seems to be held in situ. If at this time the operator looks carefully, particularly on pushing the skin and margin of the wound a little aside, he will see some tissue or substance between the blades in the space between the hinge and stone. "With a slight pressure of the point of the finger this object will disappear from between the blades, and extraction will then become comparatively easy. This is in reality one or more of the lobules of the gland; it has not been grasped between the blades, but has slipped forwards. On one occasion several of these bodies were cut or torn away without any evil result following, and in one case the lower part of the prostate was found so loose that it was enucleated with the finger as readily as if it had been a stone lying loose. Inasmuch as an enlarged lobe of the prostate causes great irri- tation, it is advocated that enucleation, when practicable, be performed so as to rid your patient of two evils at one operation. Mr. Benfield gives an account of 69 cases of lithotomy at Leicester. 57 were median operations with 3 deaths, or 1 in 19; of these 9 were adults, or above seventeen years of age; the deaths were 2 adults and 1 juvenile. 12 were lateral operations with 1 death (in an adult); so that, of the 69 cases, death occurred in 4, that is, 1 in 17. Of 90 cases formerly published (all lateral) 8 died, or 1 in 11. Of 57 recent (me- dian), 1 in 19. In the one fatal case death followed hemorrhage, caused probably by the knife slipping from the staff and wounding the artery of the bulb. (' Brit. Med. Journ.,' Feb. 5, 1870.)

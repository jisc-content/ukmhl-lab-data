Jamieson ('Edinb. Med. Journ,' xiv, 872) records the case of a wo- man, ajt. 25, who in the middle of her first pregnancy was attacked with symptoms ^ of gastric disturbance accompanied by jaundice, and lasting for several days. Six days after delivery by forceps she died in a coma- tose condition, having again suffered from the same symptoms as before. In the absence of any autopsy, the author considers himself justified in describing the case as one of acute yellow atrophy. Murchison, "Acute Atrophy of the Liver," 'Path. Soc.

Rep.,' v, 108) gives two cases of cirrhotic enlargement of the liver. In the first, a man, a)t. 38, the liver weighed iooi oz., and consisted of islets ol hepatic substauce separated by connective tissue ; in the second, a wo- man, ajt. 25, it weighed 104 oz., and though no trace of liver substance was visible to the naked eye, hardened sections soaked in chloride ot lime showed the same structural elements. He doubts whether livers doubled in weight by the development of adventitious tissue could ever contract to such a degree as to deserve the name of cirrhosis in the or- dinary sense of the word, and thinks that the same condition which mostly causes the liver to contract may also enlarge it; and that among hepatic lesions which have the latter result must be placed cirrhosis, i. e a progressive interstitial hyperplasia of the connective tissue Cayley (' Trans. Path. Soc.,' xix, 253) records a case in which the history and effects of the disease closely resembled cirrhosis, m a man, jet 62, but post-mortem the affection appeared to consist rather in the gradual atrophy of the secreting tissue. It seems to have come on independently of drink.

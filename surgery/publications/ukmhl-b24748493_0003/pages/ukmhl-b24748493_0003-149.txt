Bronchitis and Emphysema. Lebert ('Deut. Arch.,' vi, 74) gives a full summary of all the recorded cases of— (1) acute fibrinous bronchitis without fibrinous expectoration; (2) the same affection with fibrinous expectoration- (.3) fibrinous pneumonia; (4) chronic fibrinous bronchitis; (<) chronic symptomatic bronchitis ; and ends his paper with his own con- clusions in full as to these affections. TTaldenburg ('Berl. klin. Woch.,' 1869, p. 208) publishes a case of croup of the bronchi m a girl £et. 8|, who since her fourth year had been in the habit of expectorating, every second day, with great straining, firm regular masses, which under water spread out into tree-like, dichotomously branched forms, from three to four inches lon°- The child was ordered whey, and in addition inhaled lime-water from&a steam pulvensateur for a quarter or half an hour daily. After forty-five inhalations the child was well and remained so for a year, and then on catching a severe cold, expectorated the mucous sputa of simple bronchitic catarrh. The child seems also to have had impetigo capitis and the author makes the suggestion whether there was in this case Rome nosological connection between the skin eruption and the bronchial croup. Armand(«Lyon Med.,' 1870, iv, 544), at the autopsy of a man who had expectorated for some time fibrinous casts of the bronchi, found the latter filled with gelatinous filaments, their mucous membrane red and hyperav-mic, but not presenting any ulceration.

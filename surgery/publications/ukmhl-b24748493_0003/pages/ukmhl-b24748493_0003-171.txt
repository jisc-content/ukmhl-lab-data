JRupture of Heart, Sfc. May ('Brit. Med. Journ.,' 1869, ii, 6) records a case of rupture of the heart, which he considers to have been one of aneurism of the left ventricle, associated with fibroid degeneration. A man, set. 61, was seized one night with acute pain in the epigastrium, extending through to the back, and accompanied with coldness of the extremities. Two or three evenings before, he had complained of slight uneasiness in the chest, which he had attributed to indigestion. The heart's action was tumul- tuous, the sounds distinct, the pulse feeble and frequent. The pain ceased after a few hours, and did not return, but was followed by dyspnoea, with inability to lie on the right side; there was increased dulness over the cardiac region, and oedema of the legs; death occurred suddenly, seventeen days after the commencement of the illness. The autopsy showed the pericardium filled with soft clotted blood; the anterior wall of the left ventricle very thin, slightly adherent at its lower half to the pericardium; near the auriculo-ventricular septum were two small openings in the anterior wall, large enough to pass a No. 6 bougie. The heart was pale, and the aorta atheromatous. i Marcq ('Presse. Med. Beige,' 1869, 93) publishes a case of sudden death from spontaneous rupture of the anterior wall of the left ventricle, which had undergone fatty degeneration, in a woman, aet. 78. DeBary ('Deut. Arch.,' vii, 152) gives the following:— A woman, aet. 72, who had suffered from paroxysmal pains—due to gall-stones as was proved by the autopsy—was suddenly seized, September 28, i860 with pain m the left side, below the angle of the scapula, coldness of the face and extremities, cold sweat, and dyspnoea, The heart sounds wore irregular, the pulse very weak ; during the next three days she had sudden paroxysms of pain, with difficult breathing, violent eructations, a? i-ffl i1Dg- ^ Uext day' 0ctober 2> she felt well, but complained ot aithculty in swallowing fluids; her pulse was better, but still weak. u 1? ,eve1n,nS of the 4-th, while sitting up in bed and drinking water, she Jell back suddenly and died.

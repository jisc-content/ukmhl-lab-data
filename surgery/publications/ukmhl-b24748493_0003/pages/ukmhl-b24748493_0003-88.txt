78 11EP0HT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. as to modify one another, and make the diagnosis difficult. In support of his view he notices the fact that the action of the vaccinal virus is retarded or arrested in the course of the acute exanthemata, in tuber- cular diseases, in typhoid fever, &c. From May to October, 1857, an epidemic of variola raged in the hospital alongside of an epidemic of typhoid. He gives briefly a series of cases of typhoid which during con- valescence were attacked by variola—several attended with a fatal ter- mination—in which either the typhoid eruption or the prodromata of smallpox was modified. He concludes that these two diseases may modify each other; that they may coexist in the same individual; that Sydenham's continued variolous fever seems to be admissible, and that variola sine variolis may exist. Grueniot (' Gaz. des Hop.,' 1870, 398) gives the following history: a child, twenty-seven days old, apparently in good health, was brought to the Hospice des Enfans-Assisted, Feb. 18, 1870, and vaccinated next day. Two vesicles only were developed on the left arm. On March 8 twenty sisters in the hospice, between the ages of twenty and sixty-five, were revaccinated from this child, and from the same and another fifteen nurses, between twenty and thirty years, and a whole boarding-school of young girls, the child being perfectly well. On the 12th it was attacked with smallpox and died next day. None of the revaccinated had smallpox. The following means for causing abortion of the variolous pustule may be found in the ' Journ. de Med.,' 1870, p. 88 (quoted from ' L'Uuion Med.'). The parts intended to be preserved from scars are to be touched with a badger's-hair brush dipped in tincture of iodine once a day, the application commencing with the first appearance of the eruption, and continued for five or six days. Pepper ('Amer. Journ. of Med. Sci.,' lviii, 32) describes very fully a severe epidemic of variola which prevailed in 1865 in Philadelphia, attacking mainly children under fifteen years. His remarks on vacci- nation and its influence contain nothing new. Pellarin ('L'Union Med.,' 1869, vii, 697) adds further facts which help to fix the average incubation of smallpox as fifteen days. "Weiss ('"Wien. Med. "Woch.,' 1869, No. 34) publishes a case of two attacks of variola in a child in the course of two months (? !).

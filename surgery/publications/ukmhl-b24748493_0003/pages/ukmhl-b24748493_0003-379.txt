REPORT ON MIDWIFERY AND THE DISEASES OE WOMEN AND CHILDREN. BY ROBERT BARNES, M.D., F.R.C.P. I. GIMCOLOGr, EMBRACING THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF THE NON-PEEGNANT STATE. Anomalies of Structure. Bifidity of ilie uterus is illustrated by Dr. Schatz, who describes and figures four new cases of incomplete division of the genital canal in women, and three of one-borned uterus ('Arch. f. Gynak.,' 1870). By Dr. Bailly's case of bifid uterus. The patient died in the service of M. Depaul at the Clinique. The placenta had adhered partly to the septum between the two uterine cavities.

These lenses are of aperture corresponding to the size of the pupil when dilated to the fullest extent; and they are provided with stops, in which the apertures correspond to a medium and a small pupil respectively. The artificial eye is mounted on an upright stem, with a foot, and made to slide to any required height; and a branch from this stem carries a small blackened screen, intended to show the position of the image of the flame. The whole is made by Nachet et fils; and, together with a series of twelve pictures, is supplied by them for fifty francs. The copper cups for additional pictures are supplied at twenty-five centimes each, and, prepared with a simple red ground, at one franc* Dr. Maurice Perrin and M. Mascartf have contrived what they call a new optometer. It consists of a tube, carrying at one end a test object, etched transparently on blackened glass, and at the other end a convex ocular lens. Within the tube a concave lens, of shorter focal length than the ocular, traverses to and fro, and the combination allows the eye to receive rays of any degree of divergence or convergence. The indicated degrees of myopia or hypermetropia are marked on the tube, so as to be read off at a glance. The test object may be either fine characters, or concentric lines, or lines for the determination of astigmatism.

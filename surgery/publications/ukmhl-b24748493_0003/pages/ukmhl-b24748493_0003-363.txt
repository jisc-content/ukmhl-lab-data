On account of impairment of vision and turbidity of the media it is often impossible to determine the state of refraction; but the author was able to do so in seventy-three cases, which he divides into three classes. The first includes emmetropia and slight hypermetropia; the second hypermetropia of ^ and upwards ; the third, all cases of myopia however slight. The proportions were as follows :— E. and slight H. H. above £g. All grades of M. 10 women. 8 men. 21 women. 16 men. 4 women. 14 men. 18 cases. 37 cases. r8 cases. The preponderance of males among the cases of myopia is very remarkable. Among the four women, there was M. 7 % in only one; but m seven of the fourteen men. In these seven there were two cases °L ™ *J and one of M-= i' v The last was in a b°ytwelve yeara old. More than half of the patients were hypermetropic; and, among the 3 7 cases of pronounced hypermetropia, there were twelve of H. 7 -J- and nine of H. 7^. The maxima were— y, i, three times 4s, I, and 3"- Among 73 persons, there were nine presenting the highest degrees 01 hypermetropia that are seen in practice. Considering that H 7 J_ is seldom met with, and that H. = \ is as exceptional as M. = 4, the author arrives at the conclusion there is some intimate relation between hypermetropia and glaucoma; and he adduces facts and arguments to show that the former is an early symptom of the latter. His con- clusions are:— (1) The majority of glaucomatous eyes are hypermetropic. (2) Glaucoma is very rare in eyes strongly myopic; and M. 7 i seems to exclude glaucoma. (3) Hypermetropia cannot be considered as predisposing to glaucoma but as an effect of it. ' (4) It commonly precedes the other glaucomatous symptoms (5) It 13 very probably due to flattening of the cornea. tS 5 f,in certain cases removed by the influence of iridectomy Ihe neld of vision was examined in 175 cases, with the following results :—In 56, or one third, it was undiminished ; and in this category were included, especially among women, a relatively large number of acute and sub-acute cases in which central vision was much impaired, inere were also numerous instances of chronic glaucoma, and even six cases ot simple glaucoma, in which central vision was reduced to -A- or less, without the extent of the field being diminished. In the remain- ing 119 patients, the field was contracted, in 10, on the outer side only • in 24, on all sides; in 95, on the inner side only, or simultaneously on the inner side and in other directions. 23

From a microscopical examination of the tumours, he concludes—(i) That each tumour is originally developed round a hair-follicle, enclosing at the same time the sebaceous glands belonging to the latter. (2) That the smallest tumours consist of two distinct elements—a central glandular body, it- self surrounding a hair ; and a peripheral mass of very fine connective tissue, containing numerous minute oval nuclei. (3) That the glandular body is a sebaceous gland, enlarged by the separation of its sacculi from one another, and perhaps also by the actual multiplication and increase in size of the sacculi themselves. (4) That the peripheral mass of nucleated connective tissue is developed from the two external layers of the dermal coat of the hair-follicle and sebaceous glands. Murchison ('Path. Soc. Trans.,' xx, 187) gives the autopsy of a case of vitiligoidea associated with chronic jaundice and enlargement of the liver in a man, set. 41. Sections of the cream-coloured patches in the evelids showed that the colour was due to the deposit of numerous oil- granules in the meshes of the cutis, most abundant in the neighbour- hood of the hair-follicles, which were otherwise normal. On staining with carmine, a nucleus could be seen in the centre of the oily masses. The cells of the epidermis were normal. The liver was large, weighing 8o|- oz.; its surface was smooth; its capsule thickened and covered with old adhesions. It was very firm, smooth, and dense on section, with greatly increased fibroid tissue and atrophied secreting substance. Groups of rounded nuclei, or bodies resembling lymphoid corpuscles, were aggregated round the minute vessels between the lobules. The spleen weighed 23 oz., and it and the kidneys contained embolic masses. Cases of feigned cutaneous affections are given by Startin (' Brit. Med.

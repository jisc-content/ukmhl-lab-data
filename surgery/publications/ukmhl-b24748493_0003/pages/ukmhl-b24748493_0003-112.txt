102 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. The organ in which the irritating matter is formed cannot be certainly fixed upon. Vedie' ('Gaz. des Hop.,' 1870, 314) contributes the following: a man who had been admitted into the Asylum for Lunatics at Evreux, suffering from general paralysis, suddenly died in getting out of bed. At the autopsy, on cutting through the left bronchus about 2 cm. from the lunf, in removing the latter there were found the pieces of a luin- bricus (Ascaris Iwnibricoides ?) which had been cut in two at the same time, about 15 cm. long and 3 mm. in diameter. The lungs presented the appearance of asphyxia. Jacob (' Rev. Med.,' 1870, i, 520) gives the case of an officer, set. 40, who suffered from great gastric disturbance, with intermittent symp- toms of fever, lasting five days, and ceasing on the expulsion of a lum- bricus 12—15 cm. in length. Petri gives (' Virch. Arch.,' xlv, 523) a table of all the pigs killed at Rostock from May to December, 1868; of 4052, five only were found to have trichinae. Of 5457 killed in the same place in 1869 (ib., xlix, 456), one only was affected. Virchow, "Eine Corresponded uber Trichinien," 'Virch.

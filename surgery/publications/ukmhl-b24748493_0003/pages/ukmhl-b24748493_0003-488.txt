REPOET ON MATERIA MEDICA AND GENERAL THERAPEUTICS. BY THOMAS STEVENSON, M.D. Lond., M.E.C.P. Tiie following is an abstract of the reports published relating to new remedies: Apocodeia.—Encouraged by the results obtained by the use of apo- morphia, Dr. "Wickharn Legg* has experimented with this new organic base, discovered by the late Dr. Matthieson and by Prof. Cary Poster, t Dr. Legg finds that its action on man is only feeble, and that it is un- likely that it will ever be largely employed in the treatment of disease, although it is possible that its great bitterness may hereafter prove of service. On account of the extreme local irritation which the alkaloid produces, it is wholly unfitted for bypodermic injection. The base was administered in the form of hydrochlorate. Apomorphia,—This is a new alkaloid, prepared by the late Dr. Mat- thiesonj by the action of strong solution of hydrochloric acid upon mor- phia. It differs from this latter base by the elements of a molecule of water (the formula of morphia being C17H19N03, that of apomorphia is C17H17N02). Dr. Oee, in reporting to the Clinical Society§ the results of its administration, shows that it is a certain and promptly acting emetic, and that as such it possesses the following advantages over all others at present in use:—(i) It acts in extremely small doses, one tenth of a grain being sufficient, when injected subcutaneously, to pro- duce vomiting in ten minutes, while by the mouth twice as much will act in twenty minutes. (2) It possesses no irritant properties, and can, therefore, be injected under the skin without the slightest inconveni- ence. (3) It acts with unfailing certainty. (4) The vomiting produced is not followed by nausea. Chloral hydrate.—This substance is undoubtedly the most valuable * 'St. Bartholomew's Hosp. Rep.,5 1870, p. 97. t ' Phil.

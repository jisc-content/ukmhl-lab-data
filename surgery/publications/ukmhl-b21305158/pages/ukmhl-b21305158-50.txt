28 length, it is necessarily reflected back upon itself to pass to the colon, so that below the line of the colon, the two layers of the omentum must be doubled, and hence it may be said that the loose portion of the omentum which covers the small intestines is formed of four lamina;.* The young student is not less puzzled by the descrip- tions which are generally given of the bag of the omentum and the foramen of Winslow,—perhaps the difficulty will be lessened if he examines the parts in the following manner : In pulling the stomach down from the liver, the lesser omentum or mesogastrium will be seen ; and in doing this, the vessels which are passing to and from the liver may be seen or felt; these vessels are surrounded by the perito- neum and a portion of cellular membrane, and as Ibis was described byGIisson as bearing some resemblance to a cap- sule, it has been called the capsule of Glisson. If the finger be put under these vessels on the right side, it will pass under the ligamentum hepatico duodenale, and into the foramen of Winslow, which is the opening of the great bag of the omentum, the boundaries of which may be traced in the following manner:—If we push the finger towards the left side, it will be seen under the omentum minus; if farther, it will pass under the stomach ; if we try and push it backwards, it will be stopped by the pan- creas and the parts lying on the spine; if we pass it in a direction downwards, it will be obstructed by the meso- colon, and if upwards, by the liver; but if there be no adhesions formed, we shall be able to pass it up between the stomach and colon, into the space between the dupli- cature of the omentum, which, in a young body, may be distended so as to appear like a bag, by blowing with a pair of bellows into the foramen of Winslow. When the omentum is dissected from the stomach and colon, the viscera will appear very confused ; but by a little management, the parts may be unravelled. Look in the right iliac region for the termination of the small in- testine (the ileon) in the great intestine (the colon); make a small opening in the ileon, about six inches from the colon; introduce a blow-pipe, and blow towards the colon;—the colon being distended, will be seen with its membrane (mesocolon) to form a natural division in the abdomen, all the small intestines being below, and the * The portion of the great omentum which runs towards the cae- cum is called “omentum cacci”; this is quite different from the appendices epiploicae, which are found on the colon, and which are sometimes called “omentulae intestini crassi”.

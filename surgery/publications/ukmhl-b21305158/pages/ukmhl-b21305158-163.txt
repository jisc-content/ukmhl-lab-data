DISSECTION OF THE UPPER PART OF THE BODY. —= «=— As the upper half of the body includes all the parts which are above the diaphragm, and the muscles of the hack, it will be too much for a young student to under- take at once? he should therefore begin with an arm, or one side of the head. But as these two parts are, accord- ing to the rules of the dissecting-room, generally taken by the same student, I shall lay down a plan of such a i series of dissections as will enable him to make the most of these parts, and which will, at the same time, be prac- ticable while several pupils are engaged in dissecting the same body. As the student should dissect those parts first, which become soonest putrid, he ought, on the first day, in union with his companion, to attempt to make a dissec- tion of the principal parts of the brain. * On the second day, he should dissect the superficial muscles of the neck ; and on the third day, the muscles of the face. On the fourth day, he may examine the deep muscles of the throat and of the jaw, and the general anatomy of the mouth. This plan may be very easily followed if the student can turn the body as he pleases ; but as I have supposed that there is another pupil engaged in dissecting the oppo- site side of the head, his operations must also be taken into consideration. * Neither the arteries nor the veins should be injected.

341 which characterizes the first class.—They are superadded to the original class, and correspond to the number and complication of the superadded organs. Of these, there are—the IIId, IVth, and VIth, to the eye ; the VIIth, to the face ; the IXth, to the tongue ; the glosso pharyngeal, to the pharynx ; the vagus, to the larynx, heart, lungs, and stomach; the phrenic, to the diaphragm; the spi- nal accessory, to the muscles of the shoulder; the ex- ternal respiratory, to the outside of the chest. If we inquire into the reason of this seeming confusion in the second class, or irregular nerves, we shall perceive, that it is owing to the complication of the superadded ap- paratus of respiration, and the variety of offices which this apparatus has to perform in the higher animals. To explain this, the second Plan is given.—It presents, in one view, the nerves destined to move the muscles in all the varieties of respiration, speech, and expression. We may now see how confounding the numbering of the nerves, according to the system of Willis, is; and how impossible it is to make a natural arrangement, while the nerves are so numbered. PLATE 1.

Branches of the Vth Pair, or Trigeminus, which are seen to arise from the uoion of the Crura Cerebri and Crura Cerebelli and to have a ganglion at the roots. 2.2.

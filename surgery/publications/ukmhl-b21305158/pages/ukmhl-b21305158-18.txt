INTRODUCTION. XU tors, to branches of arteries, in themselves so small, that, if cut, they would not throw out more than one jet of blood ; and so irregular, that they are seldom seen twice in the same relative position. When such a knowledge of anatomy as this, is con- sidered to be of importance, it is not surprising, that the opportunity of studying what is truly useful, should be lost, and that the student should contemn the science altogether, when he becomes a surgeon.— He then finds, or is too apt to consider, that the only advantage which he derived from the study of anatomy, was, that it enabled him to pass certain examinations. I trust, that the contents of the following pages will prove, that notwithstanding what I have here said, I do not intend to disparage the knowledge of minute anatomy :—on the contrary, I contend, that no man can be a thorough good surgeon, without that know- ledge; but it must be a very different “minute anatomy,” from that of being able to give the accu- rate description of the shape and facits of a dry bone; or of the points, from which some deep muscle of the back arises, although expressed even in that technical language, which appears so imposing to a beginner. To counteract the effect of the long and hard- sounding terms, these “ sesquipedalia verba ”, which unfortunately have the effect of leading a young student to suppose, that the more difficult the name is to recollect, the greater necessity there is, of studying the part which it denominates,—I would advise him, while he is engaged in the dissecting- room, to read those books on medicine and sur- gery, which are founded on the facts of anatomy. By such a course of study, he will be directed to the proper subjects of inquiry; and he will also have the best chance of becoming so acquainted with the changes produced by disease, that he will not be in danger of being discomposed and alarmed at their ap- pearance,—nor be obliged to stop in the middle of a perilous operation, should he find the parts not exactly

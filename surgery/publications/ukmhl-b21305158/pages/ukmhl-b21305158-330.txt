308 will be found attached to almost the whole length of the coracoid process, from which it passes to the tip of the acromion (it is sometimes divided into two portions, by a little cellular membrane): this, from its shape, is called ligumenlum triangulate, or deltoides. By removing the fibres of the supra spinatus muscle, we shall discover a small ligameut running from the root of the coracoid pro- cess across the notch ; this is the ligamentum posticum (the supra scapular nerve almost always passes under the ligament, and the artery generally over it). The ligaments which run between the points of the scapula, are called the properligaments r while those which connect the cla- vicle and scapula, are called the common. In dissecting the muscles which pass from the scapula to the head of the head of the humerus, we saw the supra spinatus, the infra spinatus, and teres minor, all spreading their tendons upon the upper surface of the thin capsule ; and on the lower part, we might have seen the ligament strengthened by the tendon of the subscapularis. If we now dissect away all these tendons, the capsule will appear as a transparent membrane, rising from the edge of the glenoid cavity, and passing down to surround the neck of the humerus. This view must prove to us, that the strength of this joint does not consist in its capsular ligament, but in the tendons of the muscles which surround it. In examining the capsule, in a superficial manner, it ap* pears to be perforated by the tendon of the long head of the biceps; but when the capsule is opened, we shall fincf that a very thin portion of the membrane passes down into the bicipital groove, and is then reflected on the tendon of the biceps,—so that the tendon is actually external to the ligament. When we cut open the joint, we shall see that the g/e- noid cavity is deepened by a ring of fibrous cartilaginous ligament, surrounding its edge.—We should not omit to look for the large bursa, which is between the deltoid and the capsular ligament. The ligaments of the elbow-joint are a little complicated; in consequence of the head of the radius entering into the articulation ; but still, as the joint is nearly a simple hinge; the principal ligaments will be lateral. We shall find here; as in all other joints; a capsular ligament; but its appear- ance is not that of a thin membrane, except at the pos- terior part, in consequence of its being covered, both on the fore and lateral parts, by slips of ligament from the tendons of the muscles: those on the fore part, are called-

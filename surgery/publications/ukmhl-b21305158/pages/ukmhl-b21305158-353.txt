331 which have of la*e occurred, establish the propriety of this operation, instead of that, of only tying the artery above the wound. This same accident has occasionally produced the varicose aneurism, but not so frequently as the com- mon aneurism ; the progress and appearance of which, nearly corresponds with the following description:— When the young surgeon opens the artery,* he, in great alarm, applies a firm compress and roller; by which, the ex- ternal wound, and that of the fascia, soon heal: but the artery will continue to bleed, though not outwardly ; the blood will be impelled under the fascia; the connections of the fascia will be torn up ; a regular tumour will he formed, occupying the bend of the arm : and this tumour, stretching the fascia, will contract the fingers, and keep the fore arm at a right angle with the arm, as in other dis- eases in which the fascia is contracted, or the muscles under the fascia inflamed. By observing the anatomy of the parts here, we shall see the danger of lying the median nerve along with the artery ; and the difficulty there would be, in separating the nerve from the artery, if the arm be kept extended. We shall also see the danger of cutting off either the radial or ulnar artery, if, in operating here, we dissect too boldly.— The question of the inosculations between these several vessels, should now pass through our minds. Nor should we forget the irregularities, that must occur in the vessels here, when there is a high bifurcation of the humeral artery. A very serious accident sometimes occurs in bleeding, which our knowledge of anatomy will hardly enable us to avoid,—the puncture of one of the cutaneous nerves. When we examine the connections of the internal cuta- neous nerve with the median basilic, we shall see, that the principal branches pass under the vein; but if we look to the median, and cephalic, we shall find several large branches from the external cutaneous, passing over them. This view should induce us to prefer performing the operation of bleeding in the median basilic vein,—for, with a little care, and a sharp lancet, the artery (which is immediately below it) may be avoided : but the most dexterous surgeon may * The superficial seat of the artery, and its contiguity to the vein, causes the blood to flow sometimes from the vein, per saltum ; which circumstance has given a pale face to many a youth, conceiving it to be the blood leaping from a wound of the artery.—-The pulsation •eases upon bending the arm a little.

306 these muscles may thus be described:—Or. One of the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum. In. The sheath on the back of the fingers, along with the in- terossei. Use. To move the finger on the metacarpal bone. Abductor Indicis. Or. Os trapezium, and metacarpal bone of the thumb. In. The first bone of the fore finger. Use. To bring the fore finger towards the thumb. Interossei Interni. These are muscles lying deep betwixt the metacarpal bones, each having its origin' thus:—Or. By one head, from a metacarpal bone. In. Into the sheath of the extensor muscles on the back of the first phalanx. Interossei Externi. These are bicipites, and lie on the back of the hand, but betwixt the metacarpal bones. Or. The root* of the metacarpal bones. In. The tendinous expansion of the extensor communis. The PRIOR indicis is a muscle of the same character with the for- mer, only that, lying on the radial edge of the metacarpal of the fore linger, it cannot be so properly palled an interosseous, as those which are seated betwixt the metacarpal bones. Use of the Interossii. While there seems much reason in the supposition, that the lumbricales, being small muscles, are better calculated for the quick movements of the fingers (whence they hare been called fidicinales) ; the interossei interni, and externi, are for the lateral movements of the fingers, or the adduction, and abduction of the fingers, and are of tbe same class with the adductors and abductors of the thumb and little finger.

310 ulnar or the radial artery ; farther than that of following them patiently from trunk to branch, with the forceps and scissars.—In the first dissection, every thing is to he cut away, except the arteries and the tendons. We should first expose the superficial arch, which is formed by the ulnar; and then the deep arch, formed by the radial: but this, we shall find to be very difficult. The arteries which are seen on the back of the wrist, and on the thumb, are generally from the external interosseal, and the radial. TABLE OF THE ARTERIES OF THE SHOULDER AND ARM. It is agreed by all authors (who have taken the descrip- tion of the arteries from the dissection of many bodies,) that there are no vessels more irregular, than those which rise from the subclavian. But the general arrangement is very simple; for we have here, as in the study of the arteries of the leg, only to recollect, that the names of the branches correspond to the parts which the trunk passes. The following sketch will be found to agree, in most respects, with the description of Haller; and I have at- tempted to make the arrangement correspond with what I think is most commonly seen :—■ The great trunk, in its course from the aorta to the fin- gers, receives names corresponding to the parts which it passes. From its branching off from the aorta, until it passes under the clavicle, it is called subclavian. From the upper edge of the pectoralis minor, until it passes the ‘ insertion of the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major,—ax- illary. From this point, until the division at the bend of the arm,—humeral, or brachial. From the bend of the arm to the wrist,—radial, ulnar, and interossea. From the wrist to the fingers,—superficial arch, deep arch, and posterior arteries. The names which are given to the branches, refer to each division of the trunk. The branches of the subclavian have already been enu- merated at page 228. The next division of the artery is the axillary : from

307 DISSECTION OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE ARM, After having completed the dissection of the muscle* of the arm, we should remove them, that we may ex- amine the ligaments; and in doing this, we should take the- opportunity of again comparing their origins and inser- tions with the description in the Table. We should not remove every part of the tendons of the muscles which are attached to the head of the humerus; for they are so inti- mately connected with the capsular ligament, that we shall destroy it, in the attempt. The ligaments about the shoulder may be divided into three sets:â€”1. into those which connect the clavicle and scapula; 2. the ligaments which pass from one point of the scapula to the other; 3. the ligaments connecting the humerus and scapula. When the fibres of the deltoid are removed, slips of li- gament will be seen passing from the clavicle upon the acromion; these are called Ligamenla Radiata. There is also a proper capsular ligament, and occasionally an in- termediate cartilage between the acromion and clavicle ; but the principal ligaments pass between the coracoid pro- cess and the clavicle: one will be found running from the root of the process up to the tubercle on the lower part of the clavicle, and, from its round shape, it is called liga- mentum conoides; another, but of a more square form, runs from the root to the lower part of the clavicle, ex- tending from the last ligament to near the acromial end of the clavicle; this is called ligamenlum trapezoides. The ligaments which run between the points of the scapula, are very simple: one, of a triangular form.

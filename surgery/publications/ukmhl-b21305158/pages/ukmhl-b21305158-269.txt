247 DISSECTION OF THE NERVES IN THE THORAX AND ABDOMEN* The viscera of the thorax and of the abdomen, should, in the first dissection of the nerves, be sacrificed to it. But after the nerves have been once fairly seen, there will be no difficulty in exposing them, in union with the ar- teries, in future dissections. The thorax is to be opened, by removing the sternum, with the cartilages of the ribs: hut in doing this, we should cut very close upon the inside of the upper part of the sternum, as some of the nerves lie very near the in- ner surface of the bone. If there be no disease in the viscera of the thorax, the phrenic nerve of the left side will be seen passing over the pericardium, immediately opposite to the apex of the heart;—the one on the right side, is situated rather lower down on the pericardium.—There will be no diffi- culty in showing the distribution of these nerves upon the diaphragm. The dissection of the next set of nerves requires great care. If we look to the middle cervical ganglion, or to the point of the sympathetic, where this ganglion is ge- nerally found, some very delicate branches will be seen going off; and which, if carefully traced, will be found passing to form the superficial cardiac plexus. The par vagum should be traced into the thorax, be- fore the deeper branches of the sympathetic.

85 The uterus and ovaria may now be dissected from the other parts. When the cellular membrane is removed Irom the uterus, we can comprehend how the names of cervix, body, and fundus, have been given to its several parts. When the uterus is opened, we shall see that it has, internally, a fleecy secreting surface; and on each side of the upper part of the cavity, we shall discover an opening, by which we may pass bristles into the Fallopian tubes. If we make a section of the ovarium of a young person, several small transparent vesicles, which are supposed to be the ova, will be seen; they are often called corpora graafiana. In an older person, and particularly in one who has been pregnant, small cysts are generally found in tbo ovarium ; they are supposed to correspond to the number of ova which have escaped. Immediately after conception there is a cyst of a yellow colour,—whence it has been called corpus euteum. The vessels in the pelvis of the female differ considerably from those in the male,—principally in there being four additional arteries of importance, viz. the two spermatic ARTERIES, which run to the ovaria and to the fundus, and to the body of the uterus ; and the two UTERINE ARTERIES, which arise from the internal iliacs, and pass to the lower part of the uterus, and inosculate freely with the spermatic arteries. Each of these vessels has a corresponding vein. The arteries to the external parts, nearly correspond with those in the male. The nerves will be described with those of the abdomen. DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. The object of the student, in his first dissection of the thigh, should be to acquire a general idea of the connec* ;tions of the muscles and of the ligaments. In his second dissection, he should, trace the injected arteries; and in the third, the nerves, with the arteries uninjected: he ' will then be prepared to study the parts in connection, so ns to make himself master of the surgical anatomy of i .he lower extremity.

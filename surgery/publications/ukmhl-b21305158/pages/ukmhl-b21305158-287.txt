265 pushed towards the fore part of the cavity, it will pass into the Eustachian lube: but it will not be possible to push the probe into the throat, without injuring the little bones in the tympanum,—the tube, therefore, should be examined in the throat. * As we have determined to sacrifice the bones, for the purpose of examining the eye, nose, and ear, the follow- ing cuts should be made :—The lower jaw having been removed, the saw should be carried in a line parallel with the cavity of the tympanum, cutting through the glenoid cavity, and terminating in the foramen ovale of the sphe- noid bone;—another cut (if the orbit has not yet been opened) should pass through the os malae, at its union with the superior maxillary bone, and be carried in a line through the frontal and sphenoid bones, so as to meet the first cut into the foramen ovale: when the triangular piece of bone which is included between these cuts, is re- moved, it will be easy to show the whole extent of the Eustachian tube ; and if one half of the soft palate be cut away, the trumpet mouth of the tube will be exposed;— and now a small probe (for, at one point, the tube is very narrow) may be passed into the tympanum ;—the tube may be laid open, through its whole length, with a pair of strong scissars. We shall now be convinced of the imprac- ticability of passing a probe into the ear from the mouth.— The mere possibility of doing it from the nostril, will be seen. It is now easy to understand, that if the Eustachian tube be closed, after an ulcerated sore throat, deafness may be the consequence ; or how temporary deafness is frequently occasioned by catarrh. In proof of the cause of this, we shall find, that in children who die of cynanche, the tube is generally full of purulent matter. It must also be evident, that, in those people who can throw smoke from the mouth, out by the ear, the membrana tympani must be in part destroyed. Besides the bones, (the malleus, incus, orbiculare, and stapes,) there are certain small muscles within the cavity of the tympanum ; but these are very difficult to show. On the upper part of the Eustachiair tube, a mus- cle lies, partly in a cavity, which, in the dry bone, being something like a marrow-spoon, has been called the * The following directions for cutting the bone, were written under the idea, that the dissection of the ear was to be the principal object: —it will be easy to vary the cuts a little, if the posterior nares, &c. have already been examined.

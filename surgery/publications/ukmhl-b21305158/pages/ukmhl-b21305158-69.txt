47 in the fetus, the vessel which passed from the vena portae, though really a continuation of the umbilical vein, was called the ductus venosus,—so is the ligamentous matter, iu the adult, above the transverse fissure, called the re- mains of the ductus venosus; and even the portions of the great fissure receive names corresponding to the terms used in describing the two portions of the umbilical vein which lie in them. There are only two fissures in the liver which should be named :—the Umbilical, which divides the right from the left lobe,—and the Transverse, in which the great branches of the vena porta; lodge. But anatomists have chosen to call the sulcus, in which the gall bladder lies, the fissure of the gall bladder; and the depression on the back part of the liver, for the passage of the great vein, has been called the fissure of the vena cava, though it is not un- tisual for the cava to pass through the substance of the liver ;—even the notch corresponding to the convexity of the vertebrse, is sometimes called a fissure. Besides those fissures which are generally described, there are frequently irregular depressions, as if the lobes had been cut with a knife. There are generally five lobes of the liver described, but the two great lobes and the lobulus Spigelii are the only important ones ; for, the lobulus quadratus, or ano- nymous, is only that portion of the liver which is be- tween the gall bladder and the umbilical fissure,'—while lobulus, or processus caudatus, is tbe name given to that part of the right lobe which projects to the lobulus Spigelii. On the surface of the liver there are a great many lym- phatics, the branches of which can be injected from the trunks, as the valves may be broken down by the weight of the quicksilver. The greater number of the trunks pass towards the porta, so that they, also, as well as the principal vessels and nerves of the liver, are contained within the capsule of Glisson. The substance of the liver was called by the ancients, parenchyma; a name implying little more than a con- fused mass ; and if we make a section of the liver, though we shall see a great number of subdivisions formed by the membrane which supports the various sets of vessels, still they are so bound together, that it is very dif- ficult to ascertain the real structure of the gland. The small round bodies, of which the substance is principally composed, have been called acini, and have been sup- posed to be the terminations of the very minute branches

53 DISSECTION OF THE PARTS IN THE PERINEUM. —»©««— After the student has finished the dissection of the muscles and of the viscera of the abdomen, he should, in union with his companion, dissect the parts in the peri- neum ; but if the body be that of a female, he had better proceed to the dissection of the muscles of the thigh. It is almost needless to remark, that before the muscles of the perineum can be shown, that the studeuts who are dissect- ing the upper half, and to whom all the muscles of the back belong, must either permit the body to be cut through at the loins, or to be put into a certain position. Although some of the muscles of the back must be cut in dividing the body, still it will be to the advantage of all parties that the division should be made, for the tour dissectors must now necessarily interfere very much with each other. When we consider the operations which we may her called upon to perform on the parts in the perineum, we shall have a just notion of the necessity of the study of the anatomy of this part, to the surgeon who proposes to be an operator. But when it is known, that a common ab- scess in the perineum has not unfrequently been the cause of death, in consequence of the peculiar formation of these parts, it will be allowed, that the study of the minute anatomy of the perineum, should not be confined to the operating surgeon only. No one will assert that he can safely manage even the slightest obstruction in the urethra, unless he knows every turn of the passage j and if he can- not be confident in his treatment of a most common case, how can he possibly understand the proper and safe treat- ment of those complicated fistulse which are now so fre- quent, and which require such nice operations? It might be thought that such observations were quite unnecessary, were it not a common opinion among students, that eveu the operation of lithotomy may be performed, by one who> is not conversant with the anatomy of the parts, if he makes use of instruments which are nicely adapted to each other.

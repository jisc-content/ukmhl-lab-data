92 It will, perhaps, assist us in recollecting these muscles, if we arrange them into classes. This may be done in several ways, but to all of which there are many objec- tions. The following plan is offered, although it is also very faulty. To pull the thigh backwards, there are three muscles, viz. the GLUTEUS MAXIMUS, GLUTEUS MEDIUS, and GLUTEUS minimus, which have, as antagonist muscles, the psoas MAGNUS and iliacus internus. The class of muscles which more particularly roll the thigh, is composed of the pyriformis, gemellus su- perior, OBTURATOR INTERNUS, GEMELLUS INFERIOR, OB- TURATOR EXTERNUS, and QUADRATUS FEMORIS. CLASSIFICATION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE THIGH, LEG, AND FOOT. MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. The three superficial muscles, fascialis, sartorics, and gracilis, may be classed together. If these three are removed, twelve muscles will remain on the thigh ; of which four are inserted into the patella, and extend the leg, viz. the rectus, vastus externus, vastus internus, and cruraius. Four bend the leg, and are inserted into the tibia and fibula, viz. semitendi- nosus, semimembranosus, biceps, and topliteus. And four, which pull the thighs together (adductors), are in- serted into the linea aspera, viz. pectinalis, adductor LONGUS, ADDUCTOR BREVIS, and ADDUCTOR MAGNUS. MUSCLES OF THE LEG. As the muscles which bend the toes are situated on the back part of the leg, and those which bend the foot are on the fore part, it is not possible to make a good arrange- ment according to the uses of the muscles; therefore, in the following plan, the use of the muscles is entirely neglected, the arrangement being made according to their relative situations. There are twelve muscles on the leg, which may be di- vided into two great classes, viz. into six on the fore part, and the same number behind,—rboth of which maybe sub- divided : the six on the fore part, into three on the fibula, viz. PERONEUS LONGUS, PERONEUS BREVIS, and PERONEUS tkrtius—and three, more directly on the fore part, tibia- lis ANTICUS, EXTENSOR DIGITORUM COMMUNIS, and EX*

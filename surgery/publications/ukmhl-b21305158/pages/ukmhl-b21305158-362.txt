EXPLANATION OP THE PLATES. —==B«®lO<®®e'=— Independently of the truth or philosophy of Mr. Bell's observations on the nervous system, we have at present to consider it as an arrangement merely,—as a plan for facili- tating the acquirement of a knowledge of the nerves. When we contemplate the dissection which we have made of the nerves of the face, neck, and chest, and are lost in the confusion of the VII11', VIIIth, and IXth,—of the branches of the cervical nerves, and of the sympathetic,— of the diaphragmatic and spinal accessory nerves, we shall be prepared to see the advantages of the Plans which are aunexed. I think the student will soon discover, that the system, of which the Plans may give him some idea, is not only a most remarkable improvement in the knowledge of the structure and functions of animal bodies, hut is of the greatest use in practical anatomy, by facilitating the comprehension of a very useful department. The principal arrangement is this:—there is an obvious division of the medulla spinalis, corresponding to the ce- rebrum aud cerebellum;—every regular nerve has two roots, one from the anterior of these columns, and another from the posterior. Such are the Vth pair; the subocci- riTAL! the SEVEN CERVICAL ; tile TWELVE DORSAL J the five lumbar ; and the six sacral; viz. thirty-two per- fect, regular, or double nerves.—These are laid down in the first Plan. They are common to all animals, from the worm up to man ; and are for the purposes of common sensation and motion, or volition. They run out laterally to the regular divisions of the body, and never take a course longitudinal to the body. JFor the sake of arrangement (although the term be not correct w-hcre every thing is perfect), the remaining nerves are called irregular nerves. These are distinguished by a simple fasciculus, or single root; that is, a root from one column. These are imperfect in their origins, irregu- lar in their distribution, and deficient in that symmetry «

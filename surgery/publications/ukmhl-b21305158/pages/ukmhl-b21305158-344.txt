22 DISSECTION O 9 THE NERVES OF THE ARM. The dissection of thenervesof the arm may be made on the same limb in which the arteries are traced. The nerves which form the axillary plexus, y'iz. the POUR LOWER CERVICAL, and FIRST DORSAL, Will be foUIld coming from the spine, between the scalenus anticus and scalenus medius. These may be dissected with the branches of the subclavian artery.—It is from this plexus that all the nerves pass to the arm. But in dissecting the external part of the axilla, we shall discover certain small netves passing towards the pectoralis major, and lalissimus dorsi,—these are called the Thoracic Nerves: they are rather irregular in theiF course, as they occasion- ally come fronv the intercostal nerves. By dissecting deeper, we shall expose the great plexus.—By examin- ing the upper part of the plexus, we shall see a nerve passing towards the root of the coracoid process, viz, the supra scapular nerve ; which may be traced through the notch, to the supra spinatus muscle. Another nerve,, the infras capularis, will be found passing from the pos- terior part of the plexus : it lies upon the subscapularis, and sends its branches between this muscle, and the latissi- mus dorsi; but its branches must not be confounded with those of the external respiratory,—which cross under the plexus, to theserratus and intercostal muscles. If we now pull out the plexus, and look to the back of, it, and immediately above the insertion of the latissimus dorsi, we shall find the nerve, which, from its encircling the joint, is called the articular ; it rises very frequently in common with the infra scapular.

18 weak part of the boundary between the pelvis and the thigh ; for on the iliac side of this fascia cribriformis, Foupart’s ligament is firmly attached to the fascia lata, and on its pubic side there is a firm union between the edge of the third insertion of the Poupart ligament and the portion of fascia lata which covers the pectinalis muscle.* We now proceed to the examination of the internal view. The flap of the abdominal muscles is to be held up, and the peritoneum is to be carefully torn from it; by which a useful view will be given, without our using the knife at all. At about an inch from the pubes, we see a depression, bounded by the cribriform fascia, through which the lymphatics pass into the pelvis from the thigh. The part of Poupart’s ligament which is on the iliac side of this cavity, is very firmly connected with the fascia which covers the iliacus interims muscle; and on its pubic side, the united tendons of the internal oblique and transversals muscles are inserted into the linea ileo- pectinea. If we push our finger into this depression, and force it through the cribriform fascia, it will pass down into that hollow on the fore part of the thigh, which has been already described as the situation in which a fe- moral hernia lies. The firm connection which there was between the fascia superficialis and the glands of the groin, would have prevented us from passing the finger farther down ; but if we turn up the finger as a hernia does when it increases in size, we shall find that it not only presses against the superficial arch, but that there is also a resist- ance to it, caused by a part more deeply situated ; this will afterwards be found to have been produced by that which is called the deep crescentic arch. To show this deep arch as a distinct fascia, there is a great deal of dissection required, and it may very justly be criticized as one of the tricks of the dissector $ but as it is a point of anatomy which is often talked of, we shall describe what appears to us to be the easiest mode of displaying it. It may be shown on the same limb in which the anatomy of inguinal hernia has been seen, but it would be better to have another, and then we may pro- ceed thus:—after having made the dissection of the ex- ternal oblique, and of the superficial crescentic arch, in the manner already described; we should hold up the flap of the external oblique, and dissect between it and the »n- * While at this stage of the dissection the leg should be moved in different directions, to show the effect of the various positions in relaxing or tightening the fasciae.

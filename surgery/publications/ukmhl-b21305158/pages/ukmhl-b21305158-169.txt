O 2 I4T position of the cineritious and medullary matter will be seen to vary: about an inch and a half from the surface of each hemisphere, the medullary matter will have an oval form, and be surrounded by a band of cineritious matter; this is called the centrum ovale parvum of Vicq-d'Azyry and must not be confounded with the pro- per centrum ovale of Vieussens, which will be seen when both hemispheres are cut down nearly to a level with the corpus callosum,—which we should now do. Butwe ought not to be too anxious to show this, exactly as an oval; for, in doing so, we may cut so deep, as to open the lateral ventricles, if they should be distended with fluid. When this part has assumed the appearance of a large oval of medullary matter, we shall see, in the centre of it, the corpus callosum,—and in the middle of this, there is a little furrow called Raphe, or suture, which is formed by two longitudinal ridges, running between the anterior and posterior part of the brain. By examining the part closely, we may discover the fibres which run across, and are termed line.e transverse. Our next object is, to open the lateral ventricles. This may be very easily done, if there be water in them ; for we have only to slice down the medullary matter, ho- rizontally, on each side of the corpus callosum, until the water flows out: butwe should preserve about a half, or three quarters of an inch in breadth of the corpus cal- losum, through its whole extent. It will be rather diffi- cult to know when the ventricle is opened, if there be no water in it (and this may be ascertained, by patting, with the finger, on each side of the corpus callosum), be- cause the first part which will be seen, when the ventricle is laid open, is a grey mass; — there being as yet no appearance of a cavity. But by insinuating a probe, or the handle of a knife, between this body (which is the upper part of the corpus striatum) and the cut margin of the medullary matter, we shall be able to pass it, towards the frontal bone, into the cavity in the anterior lobe, and then into that in the posterior lobe. If the brain be firm, we may expose the cavities, by cutting upon the probe, or by taking out a piece with the scissars : but the brain, when examined in the dissecting-room, is gene- rally so soft, that a knife, introduced like a bistoury, upon the probe, is sufficient to tear the medullary matter,—still we ought not to do this, if we can avoid it. When both ventricles are opened in the same manner, we can under- stand how the corpus callosum is said to form the roof

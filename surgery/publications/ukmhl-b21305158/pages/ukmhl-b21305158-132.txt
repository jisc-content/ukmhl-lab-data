110 DISSECTION or THE ARTERIES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. As the object of the student, in his first dissection of the arteries, should be, to learn the course of the trunks, and their principal branches,â€”the limb ought to be in- jected. If the subject be young, the injection of the arteries of both legs may be made at once from the aorta ; but if the body be old, it will be necessary to iuject each limb sepa- rately* because, in such a subject, we shall seldom succeed in pushing the injection from the aorta to the extremities of the arteries. But if both limbs be injected from their corresponding iliac arteries, the middle sacral artery will be lost. This, however, may also be filled, if the right leg be injected from the aorta, the left iliac having been tied immediately below the point of bifurcation. The other leg may be afterwards injected by putting a pipe into the iliac, below the point where it was tied. As the dissection of the arteries of the leg is very tedious, we should not spend much time in examining the abdominal muscles. We should merely dissect the in- guinal canal, and then cut through the muscles below the umbilicus. The viscera should also be removed. The arteries of the pelvis should be dissected before those of the thigh ; because the parts in the pelvis very quickly become putrid, and when in this state, if there be any lead in the composition forming the injection, the vessels will appear of a black colour. There are very few directions necessary to be given for the dissection of arteries that have been injected. The} are to be traced from trunk to branch : and to do this, it is only requisite to raise the cellular membrane, &c. with the forceps and scissars. But before the student commences the dissection of the arteries, he ought to consider what are the most impor-

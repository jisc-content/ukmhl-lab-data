DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. I shall at present describe only the common method of dissecting the brain; for, whatever changes may take place in our opinions regarding the nervous system, it will be always necessary to be familiar with the natural ap- pearances of the different parts of the brain, when it is dissected from above, downwards,—because this has been the method generally pursued in tracing the effects of disease or injury upon the brain. I think that the student will derive much advantage by dissecting the brains of the lower animals; because he will not only discover the meaning of cerLain names which are given to parts of the brain, but he will also find it to be the best and most interesting mode of in- vestigating the anatomy in a physiological point of view. After he is familiar with the dissection of the brain of the pig, sheep, &c. he will be able to make the dissection of the human brain in a variety of ways. To prepare for the dissection of the brain, the scalp should be cut in the line of the coronal suture, from ear to ear; then the anterior portion is to be raised from the scull, and pulled down upon the face: the posterior part should be carried towards the occiput. It is necessary to follow this plan in a private dissection; for, unless we do so, we shall find some difficulty in making the parts ap- i pear decent after the dissection is finished. In cutting through the scull, there is some nicety re- quired. It should not he cut lower down, on the anterior part, than half an inch above the frontal sinuses ;— but the cut may be carried to a lower level behind. Be- fore the saw is applied, a piece of whip-cord should be tied firmly round the scull, as a mark for the circular in- cision. The saw should not be carried through all the tables of the scull; but after having cut through the ex-

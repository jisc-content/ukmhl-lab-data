249 aaophagtoi and which form the (esophageal plexus.* After these are exposed, if we merely tear up the pleura, we shall see the continuation of the sympathetic upon the inside of the ribs, forming1, at each intercostal space, a union with the dorsal or intercostal nerves, through the medium of a small ganglion. If we then trace the sym- pathetic backwards, we shall find that it encircles the sub- clavian artery with a plexus of branches, from the ante- rior part of which, those going to the viscera of the tho- rax pas» off,—while the deeper branch forms a distinct ganglion, and then passes down along the ribs, as that nerve which, according to the old nomenclature, was called the intercostal.+ By now tracing the oesophagus through the diaphragm, we shall see the united branches of the par vagum passing upon the cardiac part of the stomach, to form the plexus which has been called the Corda Venlricult. We should then look to the side of the chest, and we shall see three or four branches passing off from the sympathetic, to- wards the bodies of the vertebrae: there they unite, and form a division, which is called the anterior splanchnic, which will be found to perforate the diaphragm. By looking on the abdominal side of the diaphragm, we shall, by pulling upon the nerve within the chest, discover that a large ganglion is formed immediately by the root of the cceliac artery: this, being of a crescentic shape, i» called the semilunar ganglion ; but it has more the ap- fiearance of a lymphatic gland, than of any part be- onging to the nervous system. From the ganglion of each side, branches pass off, to unite together, and with those of the par vagum, so as to form a great plexus, which has been called the cceliac plexus, or, more commonly, the solar plexus; from which, we may trace branches to each division of the • In the dissection of the camel, we discovered a very beautiful plexns of nerves upon the oesophagus : these were in connection with a set of branches on the upper part of the pharynx. As these were also seen in the calf, and not in the ass,—it is reasonable to suppose, that they are peculiar to the ruminating animals, to combine the actions of the pharynx and stomach. t In dissecting the deep nerves of the thorax, we should place the body so, that the viscera of the abdomen shall drag down the diaphragm. It will be still better to open the abdomen, and to re- itiore nil the small intestines, before the dissection of the nerves of the Utoft* is completed.

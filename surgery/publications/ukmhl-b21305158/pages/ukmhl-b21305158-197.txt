175 DISSECTION or THE DEEP MUSCLES OF THE NECK. â€” After dissecting the small muscles of the face, we should remove them, and then examine the muscles of the jaw. The temporalis and masseter may be easily dissected ; but before we can form a correct idea of the other muscles, and of the deep muscles of the throat, we must make a section of the jaw. The most convenient method is, to cut out the portion which is between the symphysis and the insertion of the masseter ; if we leave a small portion of the symphysis, we shall still have a very good view of the muscles which run from it to the os hyoides. If after examining these muscles, we pull the jaw towards the ear, we shall be enabled to dissect part of the ftery- GOIDEUS EXTERNUS, and PTERYGOIDEUS INTERNUS. (Here I may observe, that the young student is often confused in making the dissection of these two muscles, in conse- quence of the externus being really the most internal of the two.) To expose the pterygoidei completely, it will be necessary to cut away the insertion of the temporalis, and the origin of the masseter. After the origins and insertions of the two pterygoid have been seen, the jaw should be entirely removed, which will be easily done, by forcing the condyle from the glenoid cavity.* The mouth is then to he thoroughly- cleaned ; and to do this effectually, it will he necessary at the same time, to push pieces of sponge into the larynx, pharynx, and posterior nares, as the secretions are con- stantly pouring from these cavities. A strong piece of twine should he put through the tongue, by which it may- be pulled out and extended. When we look into the throat, we shall see the soft palate, or velum peindulum palati. At the posterior * It will be a great advantage to this view, if both sides of the jaw cau be removed.

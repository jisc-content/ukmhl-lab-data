321 or as a plexus, to the ulnar side of the arm,—and here it is sometimes called ulnaris superficialis, or cubitalis interna.—It passes up by the inside of the tendon of the biceps; there it receives the median basilic. It then passes deep by the side of the artery. It is sometimes found joined to the venae comites ; or it passes singly to the out- side of the tendon of the peetoralis, and then falls into the axillary vein. On the tore part of the wrist, we see a plexus coming from the thumb and palm. This plexus is frequently continued for a considerable way up the arm, before it forms a trunk ; which gives out branches, both to the basilic and cephalic ;—the trunk is called median, or vena superficialis communis. Near the bend of the arm, it generally divides; one branch goes to the basilic, and is called median basilic,—and the other to the ce- phalic, and is called median cephalic. It is needless to describe the deep veins of the arm, as they accompany the arteries,—whence they receive the names comites, or satellites: there are generally two, accompanying each of the principal arteries. We have now traced the veins up into the axilla; here the trunk is called axillaris : and at this part, we may trace branches into it from the shoulder, from the sca- pula (the external and internal scapular), and some from the side (the thoracic veins). We may then trace the vein under the clavicle ; and there it is called subcla- vian. If we have injected the great veins, we shall see the union, on the left side, with the internal jugular;— at this angle, the thoracic duct enters. The great trunk may be traced across the chest, to unite with those of the opposite side, to form the vena cava descendens ; but the manner of showing these, is described more fully at page 226.

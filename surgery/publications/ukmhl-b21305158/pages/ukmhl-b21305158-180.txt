158 readily perceive, by examining the origin of one of the spi- nal nerves ; for they have each a distinct root from the an- terior and posterior portion. But to follow this subject farther, see the dissection of the Spinal Nerves. MANNER OF EXAMINING THE BRAIN TO DISCOVER THE APPEARANCES OF DISEASE. As I cannot go fully into the description of the morbid anatomy of the brain, I shall only make such remarks, as I hope will induce the student to investigate the subject. The scull should be opened, nearly in the same manner as described at page 143. In cutting through the scalp, we ought to calculate how far the degree of fullness of its vessels is attributable to the position of the head after death} and in raising the scull-cap, we should recollect, that the degree of resistance produced by the adhesion of the dura mater to the bone, will depend on the age of the subject, or on a particular form of the scull; the quantity of blood which escapes in tearing up the scull, will generally correspond with the state of the vessels in the scalp. The appearances of disease on the external part of the dura mater, frequently depend on the state of the scull. Thus, if there has been a puffy tumour of the scalp, in consequence of a blow, and if the bone be dead, there will probably be matter on the corresponding part of the dura mater; but if there has been a venereal caries of the scull, which has made slow process, it is more likely that several layers of lymph will be found upon the dura mater. If a piece of bone has exfoliated, or if a portion has j been removed by the trephine, the hole will be found to be filled up by a fungous growth of the dura mater; but if, instead of this, the dura mater has ulcerated, there will be a protrusion of the brain. As tumoHrs are very seldom p, found on the dura mater, unless there has been also dis- ease of the bone, we must be cautious in pronouncing the

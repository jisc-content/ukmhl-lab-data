23 ’Surely there cannot be any thing- worthy of admiration iti his manner of operating, for he most awkwardly, with both his hands, introduces his directory and bistoury on the side of the sac next the pubes, and runs them inwards, so as to cut up the attachment of the Poupart ligament to the os pubis. He does not describe the danger which the obturator artery would be in from this cut, but he warns us to take care that we do not wound the uterus or blad- der: by this last advice he clearly shows to what a depth he would pass his knife, and what a confused idea he had of the parts. We may say in conclusion, that although the study of the anatomy of the groin must always be considered as a principal part of the surgical education of a student, still, after he has made himself master, not only of the simple anatomy, but also of the confused descriptions of the parts which have been given at various times, he has much to learn to make himself competent to undertake an opera- tion for femoral hernia. Those who have seen many opera- tions for femoral hernia, must allow, that they hardly ever saw the appearances exactly similar in two cases. The knowledge of all the circumstances is only to be attained by watching the operations of a skilful surgeon; and by examining the diseased parts; and though we will confess that it is very difficult for a student to get such oppor- tunities, still we think, that it is in his power, while prose- cuting his studies in London, to derive much more benefit by examining the preparations of hernia which are to be found in Anatomical Museums, and by paying attention to the history of cases given by a surgeon well acquainted with anatomy, than by endeavouring to follow all the va- rious descriptions which have been given of ihefascia:.” I trust that what I have said in this paper will not be misconstrued, for no one can have a stronger conviction than 1 have, of the absolute necessity of attending to the natural anatomy of the parts connected with hernia. But while students, in consequence of reading what they con- sider the best authors on this subject, are led to think only of the direction in which the stricture is to be di- vided, so as to avoid wounding the epigastric artery or the spermatic cord, they are, for these supposed dangers, (for there is hardly a case on record of the wound of either of those parts,) neglecting the consideration of questions which will be forced upon them in almost every operation. For instance, the changes which take place in the parts superficial to the sac, and in the sac itself,—the difficulty of recognising the true peritoneal sac,—the stricture pro-

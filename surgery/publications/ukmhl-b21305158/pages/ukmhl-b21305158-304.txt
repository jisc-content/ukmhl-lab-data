282 SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE NECK AND HEAD. There are so many important questions connected with the Surgical Anatomy of the neck and head, that it would be impossible for me to enter fully into any one;—all that tbe limits of a book of this kind will permit, is, to make such remarks, as will rouse the student’s attention to the importance of the subject. I shall suppose that the student ha3 made himself master of all the muscles, arteries, nerves, &c. and that he is now about to make a dissection of the neck, as a part upon which he may be called on to operate, or to give an opinion as to the nature and connections of a tumour.— The vessels should not be injected.* Previous to beginning the dissection, the student should mark all the prominent points with ink ;—he should then vary the position of the head and neck, and compare the changes which take place in the points which he has marked. In examining the neck, he should not only note the appearance, but also th a feel of the parts.—It is a good exercise to examine one’s own neck in this manner, before a looking-glass. It is not now necessary to give any rules for the dissec- tion of each part. As soon as we raise the skin, we shall observe, that there is no fascia under it, as in the limbs, but a thin muscle (the platysma'): we shall naturally pause. * Perhaps it may be advantageous to inject the arteries writli a strong solution of glue, coloured with vermilion: in this case, but a very small quantity should be thrown in, as the injection easily passes into the veins.

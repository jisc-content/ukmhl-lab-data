43 branches which come from these are called Pylorica In- ferior—Pancreatica Duodenal is—Gastro Epiploica Dextra Paticreaticee and Epiploica. From the Splenica.—Pancreaticm—Gastro Epiploica Si- nistra—and Vasa JBrevia. IV. MESENTERICA SUPERIOR Distributed to the whole of the Small lutestines; and gives off to the Great Intestines, Iuo COLICA—COLICA DEXTRA—COLICA MEDIA. V. MESENTERICA INFERIOR has, as branches, Colica Sinistra—H#moruiioidalis Interna. VI. CAPSULARES.—These, though called here primary branches, are very irregular, coming generally from the Renal, and even sometimes from the Phrenic. VII. RENALIS DEXTRA ET RENALIS SINISTRA, to the Kidneys. VIII. SPERMATICA, to the testicles in man—to the ovaria in the female. IX. IRREGULAR BRANCHES, to the Ureters, &c. X. LUMBALES—Five on each side. XI. ILIACyE COMMUNES, divided into the Iliac# Extern#:, and Iliac# Intern#. XII. SACRA MEDIA. The table of the arteries of the pelvis will he given after the description of the dissection of the parts in the pelvis. The nerves of the abdomen, though difficult to dissect, are easily arranged, for they come principally from two great sources, the par vagum and the sympathetic. But, as it is not possible to form an accurate idea of them, without, at the same time, having those of the thorax dis- sected, I shall defer the description of the manner of dis- secting them, until we come to the examination of. the thorax. MANNER OF EXAMINING THE MINUTE STRUCTURE OF THE VISCERA. The miuute structure of the viscera ought to be more attended to than it generally is in the dissecting room; but as 1 cannot enter fully into the description of it here, I shall only point out the manner of proceeding. After the liver, stomach, duodenum, spleen, and pan- creas have been removed, in connection with each other, from the body, certain parts will be seen more distinctly than when they were in situ. The examination of them

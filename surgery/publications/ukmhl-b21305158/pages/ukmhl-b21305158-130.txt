108 mcnts. We shall then find, on the inside of the joint, a very strong ligament running from the point of the tibia to the astragalus and naviculare; this ligament, from its shape, is called deltoides, or triangulare. From the tip of the fibula, three portions of ligament will be seen to pass off; one runs perpendicularly from the middle part, to the os calcis, whence it has received the name of Perpendiculare, or Medium ; another runs to the anterior part of the astragalus, and is called Ligamentum inter Fibulam el A sir a g alum Anlicum ; while the third passes from the back of the fibula to the posterior part of the astragalus, and this is also named, according to its situa- tion and course, Ligamentum inter Fibulam et Astraga- lum Posticum. Both of these ligaments may occasionally be divided into two portions; but they are not named differently on that account. LIGAMENTS BETWEEN THE TIBIA AND FIBULA. (on the upper tart.) 1. Ligamenlum Capsu!are. 2. Capitulee Fibulce Anlicum. 3. Posticum. 4. Interosscum. (at the lower part.) 1. Ligamentum Anlicum Superius. 2. Inferius. 3. Poslicum Superius. 4. Inferius. LIGAMENTS BETWEEN THE TIBIA, FIBULA, AND BONES OF THE TARSUS. 1. Ligamentum Capsulare. 2. Deltoides, or Triangulare. 3. Perpendiculare. 4. Inter Fibulam et Astragalum Anticum. 5. Posticum. The ligaments which connect the bones of the foot to- gether, may be exposed by removing- the tendons of the muscles. The ligaments are very numerous, but not of much importance. The names which are given to them.

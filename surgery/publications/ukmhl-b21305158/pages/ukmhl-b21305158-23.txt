FIRST DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. It is not of much consequence what part of the body the student dissects first. I shall here suppose, that he is to commence with the lower half of the body, which includes all the parts below the chest. But as this would be too much for one pupil to accomplish, it should be taken by two, between whom there ought to be a good understand- ing, as they will necessarily interfere with each other in their operations, and particularly in the dissection of the viscera of the abdomen and of the pelvis. Before describing the manner of making each dissec- tion, 1 shall endeavour, in a general way, to point out the best plan of proceeding. As a student ought to acquire only elementary views of Anatomy at first, he should commence with the dissection of the origins and insertions of the abdominal muscles. After having dissected the muscles, he should examine the viscera. Having removed the viscera, he may dissect the deep muscles of the abdomen. If the body be a male, he should then dissect the muscles of the perineum; and having made himself ac- quainted with them, he ought to make a perpendicular section of the pelvis, that he may examine the parts con- tained in it. The first dissection of the thigh and leg should be of the muscles and ligaments only. The plan which the more advanced student should follow is very different from this which I have laid down for the beginner; I shall not enter upon it at present, but proceed to describe the manner in which the first course of dis- section is to be prosecuted. Dissection of the Muscles of the Abdomen. The first observation which I shall make upon this dis- section, is, that the student must not be disheartened if in his first attempt he does not make such a display of mus- B

288 the throat, I was afraid, that if I tied one carotid, I should be obliged to tie the other also ; and that, even if 1 tied the carotid from which the vessel arose, there would still, from the anastomosing vessels, be bleeding sufficient to destroy a patient who had already, for the second time in six days, lost two pounds of arterial blood. The pa- tient did well. We have now brought the dissection up to the angle of the jaw ; and here comes the very important question of extirpation of tumours. In dissecting up the platysina, we exposed parts of the submaxillary, and parotid glands; under the margin of the submaxillary, and sometimes within its substance, we shall find a small lymphatic gland,—when this becomes diseased, and grows large and hard, it presses up the submaxillary gland, so as to give it the appearance of being affected ; and thus we have narratives of the extir- pation of the submaxillary, when, most probably, the disease has been only in the lymphatic gland; for the salivary glands are very seldota scirrhous. The dissection will show, that an encysted tumour may sometimes be taken out, without much hajmorrhage.—In such a case, we should first mark the situation of the facial artery and vein, and, avoiding them, make an incision on the edge of the submaxillary gland, so that we may lift up its edge, and scoop out. the tumour; but if it be very hard, and adhering to the gland, then we may have considerable bleeding, but not necessarily dangerous ; for it will pro- bably be from the facial, or lingual artery,—and either of these arteries may be tied, the cornu of the os hyoides beiug the principal guide; for the lingual artery lies above it, and the facial a little higher. We must not forget that the lingual nerve is situated between these vessels. These remarks upon the liability of a scirrhous lym- phatic being mistaken for disease of the salivary gland, apply more forcibly to the tumours which are connected with the parotid. Every student who examines the anatomy of the parotid gland, and, particularly when it is injected with quicksilver, will suspect that the histories of operations, in which a diseased parotid is said to have been wholly extirpated, are erroneous. The external carotid artery passes through the substance of the gland,— but this is no objection to the accuracy of the report; for it may be tied both above and below ; but, is there no danger of cutting the internal carotid, or the internal jugular, or the par vagum, in the attempt to extirpate

118 but that, I shall not describe, until the dissection of the nerves is finished. VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The deep veins of the lower extremity are so easily understood, that it is not necessary to make a separate dissection, nor even to inject them, to enable us to trace them. The superficial veins, which are the most im- portant, are described with the cutaneous nerves. With regard to the deep veins, or vena comites, it is only ne- cessary to say, that they accompany the arteries, and are named according to them.—We shall find that many of the arteries have a vena comes on each side. TABLE OF THE ARTERIES OF THE PELVIS, OF THE THIGH, AND OF THE LEG AND FOOT. ARTERIES OF THE PELVIS. ILIACA COMMUNIS, into the ILIACA INTERNA and ILIACA EXTERNA. ILIACA INTERNA gives off— I. Ilio Lumbalis ; to supply the Iliacus Interims and Psoas Magnus. II. Sacra; Laterales, three or four in number, to the lateral part of the sacrum. III. UmbilicalIS, or HYPOGASTRICA ; gives off branches to the upper part of the bladder, viz. Vesicates Superiores. IV. OBTURATOR ;—1. within the pelvis, muscular branches to the psoas and obturator internus; 2. a branch to the back, of the pubes; 3. in the thigh, branches to the obturator externus, pectinalis, and triceps. V. Glutea ; passes out of the pelvis over the edge of the py- riforinis, and betwixt two of the roots of the great ischi- atic nerve. Within the pelvis, 1. muscular branches— (sometimes the sacrac laterales); after it passes out, 2. Ra- mus Superficial is, viz. under the gluteus maximum; 3. Ramus Ascendens, viz. under the gluteus medius ; 4. Ramus Transversus, viz. under the gluteus medius, and forward. VI. IsCHIATICA ;—within the pelvis, and in its passage out, branches to the bladder, rectum, and neighbouring muscles ; on the back of the pelvis, to the glutei, to the great nerve, to the lesser muscles of the thigh bone, in many profuse branches.

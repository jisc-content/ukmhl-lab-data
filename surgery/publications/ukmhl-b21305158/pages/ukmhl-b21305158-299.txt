277 DISSECTION OF 1". THE MUSCLES AND LACHRYMAL APPARATUS OF THE EYE, —= »®SI©l8®-«=— The parts external to the ball of the eye, may be ex- amined on the body in which the muscles of the face have been dissected. By cutting off the orbicularis muscle, and a little cellu- lar membrane which is under it, the cartilages of the eye- lids (tarsi) will be exposed. In doing this, we must not lay the upper cartilage quite bare, or we shall be in dan- ger of cutting the tendon of the muscle which raises it,— levator palpebrj®. By pulling the eye-lids towards the temple, the ligament which connects them to the su- perior maxillary bone, will be seen. In dissecting this li- gament, we must keep close upon it, or we shall open the lachrymal sac. The external ligament by which the eye- lids are attached to the os malie, may be shown, by pulling the lids towards the nose.—The names of external and internal canthus, arc given to these angles of union. Between the union of the eye-lids on the nasal side, there is a little projection called caruncula lachrymalis.—-It is a prolongation of a fold of this kind, which forms the membrana niclilans in some animals. The eye-lids are lined by a vascular membrane, which, when the eye-lids are everted, will be seen to be continued over the anterior part of the eye, whence it is named con- junctiva, or adnata. B B

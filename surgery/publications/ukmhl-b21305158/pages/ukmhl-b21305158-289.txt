A a 2 26T all the parts of the cochlea; but in making the cut, the saw-dust will so fill the scals: cochleae, that it will be impossible to see them until they are cleaned; but we must not put any instrument into the cochlea to clean it: it should be done by dipping the preparation into water, and blowing forcibly into the scalje with a blow-pipe. We may then, perhaps, make the modioxus and1 lamina spiRALrs, with the infundibulum, distinct. I shall not enter into a more minute description of the parts, but shall refer the student to good books of Anatomy : he will find great assistance in the Plan of the Ear, published by Bur- gess and Hill, and which is copied from tile drawing used in Windmill Street, for the demonstration of the internal structure of the ear. DISSECTION OF THE EYE. As the parts of the human eye are not only on a small scale, but as we can seldom procure them sufficiently fresh for the dissection of the minute parts, we should have much difficulty in acquiring a knowledge of the structure of the eye, as an organ of vision, were it not, that we have it always in our power to get the eyes of sheep, pigs, or oxen, in a perfectly fresh state. Indeed, we shall find it advantageous to dissect the eyes of some of those animals, before we examine the human eye; because, in them, the important parts of the organ are not only the same, but they have this great superiority over human eyes, for dis- section,â€”the being much larger. But to understand the eye, as a part upon which surgical operations are to be per-

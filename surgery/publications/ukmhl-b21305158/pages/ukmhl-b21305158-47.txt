25 we shall include in it the umbilical region ; on each side of which is the iliac region; and nearer to the spine, and on the same parallel, are the lumbar regions, or the loins. Below the lower line we have, in the middle, the hypogas- tric, or pubic region, and on each side of this, there is an inguinal region. In making the dissection of the abdomen, to discover the cause of death, we must have a regard to what will least disfigure the body; the method of doing this will be pointed out afterwards; but in the present dissection, the muscles must be cut through, in the manner best suited for giving a general idea of the anatomy. Before cutting through the peritoneum, the transver- sals, on the right side, may be divided, so as to expose the surface of the peritoneum; then, by insinuating the finger between the muscle and the peritoneum, and by carrying it towards the spine, we shall be able to form some idea of what is meant by the common expression, “ that the viscera are behind the peritoneum,” in doing this, we may observe, that the surface of the peritoneum in union with the muscles, is of a cellular texture: we shall afterwards find that the inner surface is smooth and serous. We may now expose the cavity of the abdomen, by making an incision ou the left side of the linea alba, from the ensiform cartilage to the umbilicus, and then from the umbilicus to the spine of the ilium, on each side: the lower flap may be laid over the pubes. The view of the viscera now before us is most perplex- ing, and has no resemblance to their situation in the living body ; indeed it is impossible to put any one turn of the intestines into the relation which it had to any other, while it was supported by the natural and uniform pressure of the abdominal muscles in the living body. If we consider what the condition of the viscera must be, when compressed by the respiratory muscles, or when the body is in full action, and the viscera are at the same time, by their peculiar peristaltic action, propelling their con- tents from the stomach to the rectum, we may form some idea of what incorrect notions we should have of the course of a wound, or the seat of disease, were we to take our impressions from the present state of the viscera, which we see falling into almost inextricable confusion as soon as the muscles are cut through. These observations I have thought it necessary to make, because I very frequently find students teasing themselves with what they call “ relative position”;—not only forget- D

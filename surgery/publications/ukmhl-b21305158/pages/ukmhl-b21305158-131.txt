109 arc generally descriptive of the bones between which they run, and the direction their fibres take. Upon the upper part of the foot, there are no ligaments which we would particularly notice. They are called j Ligament a Dorsalia, with the addition of the names of ! the bones between which they run, and the terms Recta, Obliqua, &c. In the middle of the sole of the foot, the bands are so numerous, that we never think of particu- larizing them; but on the inner and outer part, the liga- i ments are more distinct. On the inside, a strong band of fibres may be traced from the os calcis to the naviculare: j in the upper and middle part of this, a cartilage, some- what resembling a small patella, will be found, under which is the projecting point of the astragalus: this portion of the ligament is called the Trochlea Carlilaginea, the other part being called the Ligamenlum Plantare majus, the minus being a more internal portion of the same band. On the outside of the foot, we shall find a very strong ligament passing from the os calcis to the os cuboides: this is also, by Weitbrecht, divided into two ligaments, viz. Ligamenlum inter Os Calcis et Cuboides longum, and Lig: BREVE. It is quite needless to enumerate the small ligaments which bind the metatarsal bones together. The phalanges of the toes are connected together by • strong capsular and lateral ligaments, as the joints per- mit only of flexion and extension. The. student will naturally direct his attention to l the question of Dislocation and Fracture of the several bones, while the parts are before him. I cannot enter upon the subject, but must refer him to the essays by Mr. A. Cooper, aud the System of Operative Surgery by Mr. Charles Bell, where he will find plans illustrative of the • several dislocations and fractures. L

102 The ligaments which are between the lumbar vertebra; aud the sacrum, are so similar to those of the spine, that I shall omit the description of them here. But if we pull the spine from the ilium, before we remove the muscles which lie between the ilium and the last vertebrae, we shall find that the bones are held together by two liga- ments,—one of which passes from the crest of the ilium to the transverse process and body of the last lumbar ver- tebra, and is called Ligamenlum Anticum Superius. This ligament is often of a triangular form, in consequence of a small portion of it passing also to the fourth vertebra. The Ligamenlum Anlieum Inferius runs from the same point as the other, towards the union of the last vertebra with the sacrum. The principal connection between the sacrum and ilium, is at the sacro iliac symphysis, through the medium of a fibro cartilaginous structure, which is sometimes called the Sacro Iliac fAgament; but this cannot be seen until all the ligaments are cut through, aud the bones torn asunder. Some small ligaments will be seen, after the muscles which lie between the sacrum and ilium are removed. These ligaments have been commonly called Ligamenta Dorsalia P'aga; but by Weitbrecht, that inde- fatigable dissector of ligaments, they have been divided into three distinct portions,—and if we have patience enough, we may do the same. We shall find one portion passing from the superior posterior spinous process of the ilium, to the transverse process of the fourth bone of the sacrum; this, Weitbrecht has called the Ligamenlum Poslicum Longum Ossis I Hi. By raising this ligament, the Ligamenlum Poslicum Breve Ossis Ilii will be found running from the same point to the third bone; and from the internal part of the same spine, the Ligamenlum Late- rale passes to the inferior margin of the first bone of the sacrum. The most important ligaments are those situated at the outlet of the pelvis : to dissect these, it is only necessary to remove the muscles. We shall first expose the sacro ischia- ticum majus, or rosTERius, which arises from the pos- terior part of the crest of the ilium, and from the sides and posterior part of the sacrum aud oscoccygis, and is attach- ed to the tuberosity of the ischium. The portion of this ligament which runs up towards the superior posterior spi- nous process of the ilium, is called the Superior Appendix; but a more important portion, is that which may be traced from the tuberosity of the ischium, towards the ramus of the pubes. It is called the Productio Falciformis of fVins- low.

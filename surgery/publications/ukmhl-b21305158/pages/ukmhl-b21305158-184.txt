162 should be raised from the base of the scull.—I shall endea- vour to make my remarks correspond with the order in which the parts will be presented when the brain is raised from the anterior, and carried towards the poste- rior part.—I shall, therefore, first observe, that if there has been disease of the ethmoid bone,—as from polypus of the nose, venereal caries, &c. we may expect to find a corresponding- state of the anterior lobes of the brain. It may be laid down as a general rule, that the carotid and vertebral arteries are always more or less ossified in a person above the age of fifty. If a person has been blind of one eye, we should ex- amine the corresponding optic nerve, which will probably be small and transparent, and endeavour to trace it to the thalami, so as to assist in deciding whether the nerves al- ways decussate (for it is still a question); though 1 may here observe, that w hen the left eye was blind, 1 have al- ways found the right tractus opticus much smaller and more transparent than the other ; and vice versa. If there be matter in the cerebellum, we should look to the state of the temporal bone ; for scrophulous caries in this bone will often be the cause of disease in the brain. When there is water found lodging upon the scull after the brain is removed, we must not suppose that it has ex- isted there during the life of the patient, but that it ha* escaped from the several cavities during the dissection, and has fallen down to this part. — It may even fall into the sheath of the spinal marrow; but it must be, at the same time, admitted, that when there is water in the ventricles of the brain, there will be generally some found between the spinal marrow and its membranes, and perhaps even without disease, for in the prosecution of experiments on j the spinal marrow of the ass, 1 have had occasion to open the sheath several times between the occiput and atlas; and in every instance, immediately on puncturing it, about two ounces of clear limpid fluid have escaped in a stream. This I have noticed, in a proportionate degree, in other animals. In consequence of the difficulty in opening the spinal t canal, we are frequently unable to ascertain positively, whether the parts within, are diseased or not. Of late years, it has been a common opinion, that the spinal mar- row is violently inflamed in cases of tetanus; but I sus- pect, that in the greater number of the cases which have been related, that the appearance produced by the gravi- tation of the blood after death, has been mistaken for inflammation: and this I have been more convinced of, I

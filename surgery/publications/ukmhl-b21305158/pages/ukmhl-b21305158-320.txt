298 the lower part of this muscle, we must not confound it with the anconcts, which passes from the external cou- dyle lo Ihe ulna Before dissecting Ihe muscles of the fore arm, the fascia which binds them together, should be exposed: this i* most easily done, by commencing the dissection at the outer part of the arm, and carrying it towards the inner.— 1 he dissection should be continued to the wrist; and then the several muscles which compose the first layer, may be seen through the transparent fascia. The only rule ne- cessary to he recollected in the dissection of these mus- cles, is, to remove the cellular membraue in the direction of the fibres,—For their arrangement, and their origins and insertions, see page 301. The muscles of the hand are rather difficult to dissect, in consequence of their connection with the palmar apo- neurosis. This fascia ought, to he exposed, before we begin to dissect the muscles.—The incision should be made in the middle of the hand, from the annular ligamenl to the middle finger.—The skin is to he carried toward* the thumb, and towards the ulnar side of the hand. But in cutting in the last direction, we must take care that we do not dissect off the little muscle, palmaris brevis, which is attached to the skin for about an inch below the pisiform bone : indeed this muscle should be exposed be- fore the fascia is dissected. CLASSIFICATION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ARM. It is hardly possible to arrange the muscles moving the humerus, into classes which shall have each a distinct ac- tion to perform,—in consequence of the motions of the humerus, on the scapula, being so varied. Perhaps the following enumeration will assist the student in recollect- ing them :— The muscles which are inserted into the upper part, must raise the arm ; thus the supra spinatus, infra spina- | Jus, and teres minor * being inserted into the great tubercle, | are of this class : so is the deltoides, which is also inserted 1 into the upper part of the arm,—but farther, from the I head. There is only one muscle inserted into the lesser tuber- l cle,—the sul/scapularis, and which must pull the arm ^ backwards and downwards.

121 DISSECTION or THE NERVES OF THE THIGH AND LEG, Tbe arrangement of the nervous system of the lower ex- tremity, is very simple; for there are only a few branches which pass to the skin, and three great nerves which supply the muscles. The dissection of these nerves would be very easy, were they all below the fascia; but as the cutaneous nerves are -superficial to it, it is very difficult to show them and the deep nerves at the same time. We should, therefore, dissect the cutaneous nerves first; and after having ex- rammed them, we may cut them through, or hold them aside, that we may make the dissection of the deep ' branches.* If we tear the peritoneum from the lower part of the muscles of the abdomen, and of the loins, we shall see seve- ral small nerves passing across the iliac muscles towards the thigh; these will be afterwards found to be the cu- itaneous nerves, t One of these may be seen running ! from the first lumbar, across the psoas magnus and the iquadratus lumborum, to the posterior part of the spine of Btthe ilium. From this it may be traced, for some way, in a canal between the transversalis and spine of the ilium; it then pierces the transversalis, and while lying between lit and the internal oblique, divides into two branches—one of which supplies the abdominal muscles and integuments; * It would, perhaps, have been better to have described the i nerves of the viscera before those of the lower extremity, as it will tbe necessary to remove them, before the origin of several of the t*serves which pass to the thigh, can be shown. But as this would knave broken in upon the arrangement of the dissections of the thigh, t he present plan has been followed ; the nerves of the viscera will be ti lescribed with those of the thorax; if the student wishes to dissect t them first, he should refer to that part of the work. "t- It is difficult to say what names ought to be given to the cutane- ous nerves, because there are very few authors who use the same i eras; but the most common plan is to give them such nances as are d lescriptive of their situation—thus we have the terms External Cu- i aneous, Internal Cutaneous, Middle Cutaneous, External Spermatic, »wd External Pudic. ■ ' ' M

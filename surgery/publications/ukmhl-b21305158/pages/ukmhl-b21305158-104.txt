82 If the penis, lias been cut through, below the scrotum, it will be only necessary to sew up the cut in the peri- neum ; hut if (he whole has been removed, then we must stuff the skin of the penis with tow,â€”having first passed a fine thread through the inside of the prepuce, so as to give it the appearance of a phymosis. When we cut out a fine example of stricture, &c. we should always endeavour to take a piece of the os pubis with the bladder. It is rather difficult to do this, unless we are at the same time permitted to open the abdomen; but an expert dissector will be able to etfect it, by making a large incision below. Whenever a portion of bone is re- moved, before the parts are sewed up, a strong cord should be passed through the obturator holes, so as to hold the two sides of the pelvis together; for if this is not done, the body will appear very much disfigured. DISSECTION OF THE PARTS IN THE PELVIS OF THE FEMALE. Although the dissection of the parts in the female peri- neum is not very interesting, in a surgical view, still it is necessary to make it; and at the same time to attend to the names which have been given to the several parts. The moms veneris will be found to be only an accu- mulation of adipose substance under the integuments, and which varies in size according to the general state of the individual. The cavity which begins, as a fissure, under the mons veneris, and extends to within an inch of the anus, is called the vulva, being the name given to the opening of the vagina and urethra generally. The thick folds of integument which are continued down from the lateral parts of the mons veneris, are the labia externa, or alie majores; their union, at the lower part of the vulva, being called the frenum labiorum, or Fourciiette: the little cavity above this angle of union, is sometimes called fossa navicularis. The skin which is between the

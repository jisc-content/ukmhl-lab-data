201 will generally be found in a state of congestion, and will not collapse; proving, that the patient has died in conse- quence of the gradual destruction of the lung, as a respi- ratory organ, by the extravasation of seruiu into its cel- lular membrane. In those children who die of croup, the membrane may be traced into the branches of the bronchii, and the cells will be filled with purulent matter. In those who die suddenly from the bursting of an aneu- rism of the aorta, or from hcemoptysis, the whole of the bronchii will sometimes be found so distended with blood, that it must have prevented any air from being drawn into the cells. The first thing we should attend to, in the examination of the heart, is the state of the pericardium. If the pa- tient has suffered from a lingering disease, or if there be water in the pleura, we shall probably find some fluid in the pericardium ; but a small quantity of water is so fre- quently found within this membrane, that we cannot at- tach much importance to it: indeed, this has been con- sidered so natural a state of the pericardium, that the fluid has been called liquor pericardii;—but the quantity occasionally found, is so great, that it must have impeded the action of the heart- The pericardium is very frequently found adhering to the heart. If we were to compare the number of cases which are now seen, of this, which appears to be a conse- quence of violent inflammation of the internal surface of the pericardium, with the importance which the older au- thors attached to the few cases recorded, we should be in- clined to say, that the disease of pericarditis must be much more common now, than formerly. I have frequently found the lymph between the pericardium and the heart, a quarter of an inch in thickness : in such cases, the disease had been evidently chronic; as there were several distinct layers of lymph, the most internal of which, I have been able to inject. But in those cases iu which patients die after thirty hours’ illness, we shall generally find only a very delicate layer of lymph between the pericardium and the heart. The surface of the heart which corresponds to the part of the pericardium that adheres to the diaphragm, very often appears of a white colour, one portion, about the size of a shilling, being denser than the rest,—and some- times a loose portion of membrane is attached to it; but this appearance is so very often found in the hearts of old

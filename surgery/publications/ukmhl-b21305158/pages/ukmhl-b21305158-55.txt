DISSECTION OF THE ARTERIES Sj VEINS OF THE VISCERA. —»©«— If the student does not intend to examine the minute structure of those viscera which he has removed from the body, he should now proceed to dissect the muscles of the thigh, or of the perineum, if it be a male body. But before describing those parts, I shall point out the method of dis- secting the vessels of the abdomen, and the manner of showing the minute anatomy of the several viscera. The arteries which supply the viscera are very easily ar- ranged ; indeed, the whole anatomy of them is so simple, that it is almost a pity to sacrifice the abdomen for the arteries only ; we should therefore endeavour, at the same time, to make a dissection of the venous system. The method of injecting the vessels will depend upon the manner in which the thorax is to be dissected. If the subject be young, and if it be intended to make a preparation of the arteries, then those of the abdomen are to be filled, in common with the others, from the arch of the aorta; but, in the usual dissection, where the parts are not to be preserved, the arteries may be injected after the muscles of the abdomen have been dissected. To do this neatly, we should tie the aorta above the diaphragm, and also one of the iliac arteries at its origin from the aorta, and then put a pipe into the other com- mon iliac, as close to the aorta as possible, so that there may be enough of the artery left to enable us to put a tube into it afterwards lor the injection of the lower extremity. When we inject the viscera of an adult subject at the

70 the urethra, up to the point of obstruction,* ive shail find that it is caused by the fascia of the prostate. By now carrying the catheter forwards, it will fall into the sulcus which is by the side of the verumontanum, and anterior to the sphincter of the bladder. These are all the obstructions to the passage of the ca- theter, which will be found in the dead body; but in the living body, it is a very common occurrence for the sur- geon to be foiled in his attempt to introduce the catheter through the part behind the bulb,—not so much on ac- count of the mechanical difficulty, as in consequence of there being very frequently a spasmodic action of the muscles which surround this portion,—for itis notonly the narrowest, but also the most irritable part of the canal. While the view of the section of the pelvis is before us, we should also take into consideration the operations to be performed upon the rectum. If the gut be cut in the operation for fistula in ano, as far up as the finger wilt reach, we cannot be surprised that, alter such an opera- tion, a patient should die of haemorrhage; because, by such a cut, not only very large branches of the pudic, but even of the lower mesenteric artery, may be divided.— But, luckily,.experience has taught us that it is very sel- dom necessary to cut more than the sphincter ani, in this operation. We have only to look to the curve which the rectum makes, to avoid falling into the error of supposing, that the difficulty which is offered by the sacrum to the passing of a bougie, farther than six inches into the rectum, is caused by a stricture in the gut. If we examine the rectum with the finger, we shall find that there is a natural constriction about half an inch above the verge of the anus,—here the cuticle ap- pears to terminate, and the mucous coat of the intestine to commence. If we inject the lower mesenteric veins with size, we shall he able to form some idea of the nature of piles ; for, in the greater number of bodies, the vein will appear constricted at the point of union between the mucous coat and the cuticle, and distended below it, so as to re- * The great size of the cavity of the urethra, posterior to the liga- ment of the bulb, will explain to us the difficulty often experienced in the attempt to introduce the beak of the gorget into the groove of a small stafF. It is evident, that the sides of the urethra must fall together when cut;—a difficulty, which is completely obviated by the large staff whioh is used by Mr. Belli

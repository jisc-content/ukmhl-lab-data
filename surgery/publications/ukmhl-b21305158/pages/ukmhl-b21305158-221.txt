199 death, blood is often accumulated at the posterior part of the lungs,—giving them there, a deeper colour, and render- ing them heavier. In this case, there will be found no crowd of fine vessels filled with blood, nor any other mark of inflammation of the pleura. Where blood is accumu- lated in any part of a lung, after death, from gravitation, it is always of a dark colour; but where blood is accumu- lated from inflammation, the part will appear florid. The lung which is loaded with blood, from gravitation, may be distinguished from that which is condensed by inflam- mation, by cutting into it; for then, the blood may be squeezed out, and the lung will regain its natural appear- ance;—but a diseased portion will feel denser and heavier, and when squeezed, the blood will not escape, nor will there be any of that crackling feel, which is felt in the healthy structure; and the interior of the substance, when it is cut iuto, will have much resemblance to the liver,—• whence it has been called, by the French pathologists, pul- mo hepatize. The most common disease, which we are called upon to examine, is that of phthisis pulmonalis, or consumption. When we cut into the lung of a person who has died in the early stage of this disease, we find groupes of little white, or variegated bodies, which are called tuber- cles.—They vary in size, from that of a pin’s head, to that of a bean. When the disease is farther advanced, the tu- bercles make the surface of the lung, hard and irregular; and w heu cut into, they are found to have run into masse*, in which there are little abscesses, or vomica;;—some of the tubercles iilay still be distinct from the others, and, when opened, are found to contain a thick white pus. In those patients who have long borne out against the disease, large abscesses, or vomic®, are fouud : in such cases, when the chest is opened, the lungs will he found compressed,— hard coagulable lymph will be exuded upon the surface of the pleura, and partitions will extend from the inner surface of the ribs to the collapsed and indurated lungs: sinuses of matter will he seen running among these irregular adhesions, and the lungs themselves will contain small pu- rulent abscesses, or large vomicae, and will, in other parts, be full of irregular tumours, in all the various stages of inflammation and suppuration. The state of the large vessels, in these great abscesses, is very extraordinary; lor Lhey will sometimes be found with open mouths, projecting iuto the sac,—more commonly, however, with their mouths plugged up with coagula, like the arteries of a stump after amputation.

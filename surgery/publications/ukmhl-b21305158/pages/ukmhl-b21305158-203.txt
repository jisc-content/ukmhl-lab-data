The first muscle which is to be dissected, is the pecto- ral, i s major. After the fibres have been made tense, by extending the arm and throwing it out from the body, an incision is to be carried through the skin, from opposite to the union between the bone and cartilage of the fifth rib, to the inside of the arm, at about a hand’s breadth below the shoulder. The muscle may be then easily ex- posed, by dissecting in the line of the fibres, and by carry- ing the skin first towards the lower part of the chest, and then towards the clavicle; but we must recollect, that the course of the fibres changes a little as we ap- proach the clavicle. Upon the lower edge of the pectoralis, we shall see part ot the serratus major anticus. The fibres of this muscle are more difficult to dissect than those of the pec- toralis, because their course changes according to the ribs irom which they arise;—in consequence of this, we shall R

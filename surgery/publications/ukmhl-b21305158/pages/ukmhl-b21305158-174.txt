152 from each other, and look towards the anterior part of the cavity, we shall see a white cord passing across it: this it called the commissura anterior;—we may see a similar cord on the posterior part, called the commissura pos- terior; but to see these, and the third ventricle, more distinctly, we should now slice away a great part of the thalami and corpora striata. The next point of demonstration is the nates and testes, ortubercula quadragemina. It is rather diffi- cult to expose these, as they are situated in the space between the cerebrum and cerebellum.—All the part of the posterior lobe, which is lying on the tentorium, should be removed, and then the tentorium should be cut through on each side, so as to expose the upper part of the cerebellum,—the projecting part of which, (processus vermiformis superior,) is to be held down ; the four little eminences will then be seen; the two superior being called the nates,—the inferior, the testes. The next stage of the dissection is difficult; for we ought now to expose the cavity of the fourth ven- tricle, which lies between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. If we pass a probe, slightly curved, from the third ventricle, under the posterior commissure, and give it a direction downwards, and backwards, it will pass into the fourth ventricle, the passage being called iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum, or, by the old name of aqua; ductus Silvii. If we hold back, or slice away, the upper part of the cerebellum, and raise the probe, we may perceive it under a thin lamina of medullary matter, which is the roof of the fourth ventricle, and is sometimes called valvula cerebri, or valvula Vieussenii; by cutting through this, we may look into the cavity of the fourth ventricle: and now we may observe, that this valvula cerebri is connected with, or formed of two cords, running from the nates and testes, to the cerebellum; these cords are each called processus a cerebello ad testes. There are two or three different modes of exposing the cavity of the fourth ventricle more fully. One way is, to carry the knife down perpendicularly, so as to divide the cerebellum into two portions; but the best way of ex- amining it, is, to cutout a triangular portion of the occi- pital bone, down to nearly as far as the foramen magnum. When the bone is removed, we shall see the cerebellum connected at the lower part, by the pia mater, to the be- ginning of the spinal marrow, — this portion of mem- brane is the only boundary which the fourth ventricle ha* on its lower part, so that if we tear it, we shall open

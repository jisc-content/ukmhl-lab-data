320 the injection with the wax, the water should be forced out, by holding the arm, witli the hand, perpendicular to the body, and rubbing the vessels, down towards the axilla. A ligature may be put round the subclavian vein: but itshould not be tied until the injection is thrown in from below ; so that any water which majf not have been forced out, may be pushed before the injection :—as soon as the wax appears at the subclavian, an assistant should tie the liga- ture. The injection made from a single vein, will very seldom be successful,—we may, therefore, be obliged to put the pipe into one or two different veins; but if, in cleansing thfe veins of blood, the valves be much broken, the injection may pass easily from one vein to the other. The dissection of the veins is very simple; for all the cutaneous veins, when distended with wax, will be visible- and to expose them, it will be only necessary to remove the skin.—As the deep veins follow the course of the several arteries, they require no further description. If the injection has been successful, it will have filled the veins of the hand below the part into which the pipe was put;—a plexus will be found running between the knuckles, and forming an arch on the back of the hand; this has been called the plexus dorsalis marcs, — and the arch, the arcus venoscs dorsalis. From the pari of the arch nearest to the thumb, and from a vein on the thuriib, there is a trunk rises, which is called vena ck- phalica pollicis ; this name having been given to it by the Arabian anatomists, from the idea that opening it, was useful in diseases of the head;—this vessel, when joined by other veins of the arch, forms a trunk, that runs up the radial edge of the arm, and is called vJbvA CEPHALICA MINOR, OT RADIALIS EXTERNA: at the beilti of the arm, this is joined by the median cephalic; and by this union, the great cephalic is formed, which passes up, first between the tendons of the biceps and triceps, and then between the tendons of the pectoralis major and deltoid, to dip into the axillary vein. The large vein, which is on the ulnar side of the arm, is called basilica, from a strange fancy of the ancients, that bleeding from this, was a sovereign remedy for many dis- eases ; and they moreover conceived, that the vein of tlie right arm belonged to the liver, and that of the left, to the spleen. This vein is formed by the vessels of the arch nearest the little finger, and by the vein that is be-, tween the little and ring finger; which has, from the same conceit, been called salvatella. From this source, we may trace the basilic; sometimes in one or two branches.

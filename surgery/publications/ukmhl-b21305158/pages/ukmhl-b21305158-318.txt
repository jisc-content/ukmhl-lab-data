DISSECTION or THE ARM, AFTER IT IS SEPARATED FROM THE BODY. The dissection of the muscles by which the arm is at" tached to the body, is described at pages 181 and 210. The first muscles to be dissected, are those surrounding, the shoulder joint.* A block should be put under the joint, so as to make the fibres of the principal muscle,—the deltoid, tense. We shall find that the cellular membrane and fat pass to such a depth between the fibres of this muscle, that the knife must be set on very boldly, before we can make it appear clean. After the origins and inser- tion of the muscle have been shown, the tendinous fascia by which it is connected to the base of the scapula, is to be dissected up, so as to expose the muscles which are below the spine of the scapula. This mass appears at first to be formed by one muscle only; but by looking near to the lower costa of the scapula, a line of division will be seen in it, which separates the teres minor from the infra spinatus,—both of which may be traced to the great tu- bercle on the head of the humerus. On the lower edge of the teres minor, a distinct and large muscle, viz. the teres major, will be seen running, from the inferior angle of the scapula, to the humerus, to be inserted along with the latissimus dorsi. The origins of the deltoid, from the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the scapula, must now be raised.—A smaii part of the muscle may be left attached to the humerus. * In the first dissection, every thing is to be cat away, except- the muscles.

124 Utility of suppura- tion. In protect- ing granu- lation. thus been the means of conveying gonorrhoea to Otaheite, and to many others of the South Sea islands. The matter of chancre produces a sore capable of affecting the glands on the groin^ the skin^ the periosteum^ and the bones. The fluid of small pox will occasion^ by its insertion in the skin^ poisonous matter, ca- pable of exciting fever and covering the body with pustules, all containing similar matter to that which originally produced the inflam- mation at the inoculated parts : a poison not extinguished by death ; for a friend of mine inoculated his daughter from a pustule of a subject dead from small pox, and she had the disease not in a severe form *. It is obvious, that a process like that of suppuration, and which is so frequent an effect of inflammation, must be instituted for beneficial purposes; and the uses which it serves are as follow:â€”Upon the surface of wounds, the principal advantage derived from its presence, is, that it keeps the granulations moist, and thus enables the vessels to elon- gate, and to form additions to the granula- tions, until the cavity is filled by them ; with- out the production of this fluid, the surface of wounds could never heal, because the granu- lations would be destroyed. * In the Lecture on Poisons, a very curious case will be given of a new disease, produced by the translation of a poison from the horse to man.

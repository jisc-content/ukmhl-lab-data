Many other of the natural functions of the body are supported upon the same principle; as sneezing, which is a sympathetic action between the nose, velum palati, and the abdominal muscles, instituted to remove causes of irritation from_ the nose: cough- ing, which is a sympathy between the larynx and abdominal muscles: breathing and the expulsion of the fseces are also sympathetic functions, and with these a multitude of other examples might be given. But sympathetic effects also follow inju- ries and diseases, and become the causes of restoration on the one hand, or of destruc- tion on the other; and this state of the body is called irritation. Irritation may be defined to be, an al- tered action excited in the body by an unna- tural impression. Irritation sometimes produces only dis- eased sensation; thus a sympathetic pain is experienced in the knee and foot from dis- eased hip; when a person has a stone in his j urinary bladder, acute pain is felt at the ' extremity of the penis ; the passage of an uri- I nary calculus through the ureter occasions re- I traction of the testicles and pain in the thigh; Diseased sympathy.

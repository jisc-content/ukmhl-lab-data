145 Thus we find that abscesses, though situ- ated in parts not of themselves vitally impor- tant, sometimes become dangerous by their pressure on more important organs. The danger attending the formation of abscesses arises from their size, number, and seat, or from their pressure on important parts: there is also another danger, if abscesses occur between the bones and the covering of bones. Whenever bones form the boundary of abscesses, such abscesses are tedious in their cure, and, in many cases, dangerous. Thus it is in psoas abscess: in this disease the mat- ter begins to collect on the fore part of the vertebrae, and proceeds through the psoas muscle, till it reaches the groin, where it makes its appearance just below Poupartâ€™s li- gament ; and from examination of these cases after death, the vertebrae are found ulcerated. It is not my intention now to enter into the consideration of psoas, or lumber abscesses, as they will be treated of on another occasion; but I j ust mention the complaint, to show the danger of abscesses between bones and their coverings; and that the reason is, the union between the soft parts and bone is with diffi- ; culty produced, and the process of restora- ! tion is extremely tedious. Abscesses are acute or chronic. The adhesive inflammation first occurs: VOL. I. L Abscesses are acute and chronic. Acute.

103 of the bone; it should be integument and not muscles, which cover the end of the bone; for if muscles are brought with the integument over the bone, they will contract, and retrac- tion of the skin covering the stump will be the result. When the limb has been removed, you will apply ligatures to the bleeding ves- sels ; now I would not advise you to tie every small vessel; ligatures on the principal vessels are quite sufficient, and the fewer you apply the better; for though it is very desirable to prevent disturbance of the limb on account of haemorrhage, yet by waiting a short time after the operation, the bleeding from the smaller arteries will generally stop * During an operation, especially in winter, the patient becomes chilled, or if a considerable quantity of blood has been lost, he becomes faint. In either case the blood will not flow from vessels, which may afford a very free haemor- rhage, when the patient gets warm in bed, or reaction takes place. Independent of the mischief which must re- sult from opening an extensive wound to take up these vessels, at a time that the adhesive process is probably going on, the patientâ€™s life is often endangered by the after bleeding. The plan I usually adopt is as follows: after the larger vessels have been secured by ligatures, I bring the edges of the wound together by one or two strips of plaster, and then have the patient put to bed; and when the pulse in- dicates that the heart and arteries are again acting with their proper vigour, if there be any fresh haemorrhage, the H 4

Usually some days after the brain has been wounded, the divided parts begin to unite by the adhesive inflammation; if this process cannot effect a cure, granulations form, which, at length, project through the opening of the skull, and give rise to the fungus before mentioned. Upon proper treat- ment the safety of your patient depends. If you do not repress the growth of the fungus, there will be violent constitutional irritation, and the life of the person will be destroyed; but, on the contrary, if you attend to the con- dition of the wound, and prevent the fungus from rising, you will succeed in effecting a cure.

You are to apply to the fungus a piece of lint, wetted by liquor calcis; and over this a strap of ad- hesive plaister; when you examine the part on the following day, you will find the fun- gus considerably diminished; you are then to use a thicker piece of lint, and the strapping as before; pursuing this plan, you at length bring the fungus to a level with the scalp; but this is not sufficiently low for your pur- pose ; therefore, you must proceed until you have succeeded in getting it on a level with the bone, in which position it must be cau- How re- stored.

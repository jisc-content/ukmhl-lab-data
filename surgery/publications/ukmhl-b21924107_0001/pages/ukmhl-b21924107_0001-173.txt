143 upon large abscesses, and show you the pro- priety of endeavouring to procure the adhesive process, by bringing the sides of the abscess together. Very large abscesses sometimes terminate favourably, but in a great number of cases they destroy life. The next circumstance which renders ab- scesses dangerous, is their number. Thus a great number of little abscesses on the surface of the body, in small-pox, frequently destroy life. Here nature performs the suppurative process; the pustules die away, and the cu- ticle is separated from the surface of the body; but nature has not the power, in many cases, of repairing the destruction of the cutis; the want of which occasions great irritation, and the patient dies, as if destroyed by a burn or scald. Abscesses are also dangerous from their being situated in vitally important parts, such as the brain, heart, or lungs. Abscesses in the brain are very rarely recovered from, nor are those of the heart. Abscesses of the lungs, in some constitutions, are dangerous, but are most recovered from, when the quan- tity is large. They are dangerous even when they are not seated in parts of vital importance, if they press on organs essential to life.

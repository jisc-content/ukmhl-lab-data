A fluc- tuation may be perceived by feeling the part with two fingers at a slight distance from each other. The cuticle separates, a vesica- tion destroying its attachment, and the cutis and cellular membrane become thin, so that the matter gradually approaches the skin. Sometimes the external surface of the skin ulcerates in a number of spots to meet the ulceration from the interior, but generally the process is entirely from within. At length an opening of an irregular kind is produced, and the matter gradually escapes, as the aper- ture enlarges. The time required for the completion of ^ qmred for this process depends upon the constitution of foma- ^ ^ ^ ^ tion of pus. the patient, and the nature of the parts, in which, or under which, the matter is formed. If seated under a tendinous structure, ab- scesses are very slow in proceeding to the skin, on account of the difficulty which at- tends the ulcerative process in tendons. In a healthy constitution from seven to fourteen days will be required to form and to break an t abscess in the breast of a female, who is I otherwise healthy, although it it sometimes a I much longer time.

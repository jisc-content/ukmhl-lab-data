138 Parts little organized ulcerate with diffi- culty. our wards, the great number of sore legs, compared with ulcers of other parts. In those parts which are endued with little vascularity, ulceration takes place with diffi- culty. This is the case with tendons. Tendinous parts possess very little blood; very few arte- ries or absorbent vessels are distributed to them. Hence the process of absorption pro- ceeds with great difficulty, and tendons will slough to a great extent, rather than become absorbed. This circumstance must influence our practice. In abscess, under the fascia, an incision should be made as soon as pos- sible through the covering, to liberate the confined matter. So in abscess of the finger, when the constitution suffers because the theca will not give way to the process of ul- ceration, and the nervous system becomes irritated by the pressure of confined matter, an early incision should be made to liberate the matter, and give relief to the constitution. The same practice should be pursued in ab- scess of the palm of the band*. * The blood vessels ulcerate with extreme difficulty, and they may be occasionally seen completely exposed, from the destruction of the surrounding parts by the ulcera- tive process. In the extensive ulcers, which sometimes occur in the groin of debilitated patients, from venereal af- ^fection, I have several times seen a portion of the saphoena major vein, as well as a part of the femoral vessels, expos-

Mr. Toulmin extracted the tooth by the ladyâ€™s desire, and in a short time the paralytic affection entirely subsided. Irritation on the nerves of the grand sympathetic is communicated to the stomach probably through the medium of the semi- lunar ganglion, and vomiting is directly pro- duced, also in strangulated hernia, or when biliary or urinary calculi are passing the re- spective ducts, or when a severe blow is re- ceived upon the testicle.

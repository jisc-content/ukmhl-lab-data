175 ing than a longitudinal, costeris paribus. The reason is, that the vessels have to elongate much less from the edge to the centre in a longitudinal, than in a circular* sore. The form of the sore, therefore, has an influence on the readiness with which cicatrization takes place. Sores are very often difficult to heal from their situation. Thus, if a sore be situated at the back of the leg, there will be often great difficulty in healing it. Indeed such a sore can only be healed by raising the heel, and so loosening the skin, in order to give it a power of being drawn in to form a new cicatrix. By this means the vessels are more readily elongated, and continually draw the skin nearer the centre of the sore. It appears, then, that the form and situation of the sore have a veiy considerable influence on the healing power. Where there is much loss* of skin, ulcers heal with great difficulty, because the skin must form from the edge to cover the sore, and the edges will not easily draw in*. * The process of cicatrization is extremely slow on ulcers situated in those parts of the surface which become I folded, or of which the position frequently varies from the I motion of joints, as in the groin from the motions of the hip, I in the ham from the motions of the knee. It is from the i constant disturbance of the granulations; and on this ac- i count extensive sores in the groin, more particularly, are I extremely difficult to heal.â€”^T.

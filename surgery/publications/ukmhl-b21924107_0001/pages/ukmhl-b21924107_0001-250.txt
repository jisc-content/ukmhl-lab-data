Separation of muscles. Separation of nerves. Separation of arteries and veins. 220 these persons from their irritability and mode of life. The next part that separates is, muscle. Muscles separate nearly opposite the edge of the skin. Wherever the skin separates, the muscle gives way; a line of separation is formed, and the living portion of muscle is removed from the dead. This is not the case with tendons; these, like the cellular tissue, do not separate opposite the skin, but at a considerable distance from the part at which the sloughing happens. If a tendon be ex- posed in the palm of the hand, by a sloughing . ulcer, it separates near the wrist; for it is in- capable of resisting the inflammation, in con- sequence of its weak living powers, and sepa- rates, therefore, at the part where it joins the muscle. The nerves separate, like muscles, opposite the skin; but the most extraordinary instance of the process of separation is, that which takes place in the larger blood vessels. What would be the result, if the anterior and poste- rior tibial arteries were cut, without placing a tourniquet on the limb? the person would die in a few minutes. Yet nature frequently di- vides the arteries I have mentioned, without any blood issuing from the limb. This hap- pens in the following manner: The blood in the vessels of the dead part becomes coagu-

121 tissue has in its interstices adhesive matter effused, which prevents the pus from passing into its cells in a healthy abscess. Pus is a yellow fluid: if poured into water Mature of it sinks in it, and is consequently of greater specific gravity than water; on the other hand, mucus generally swims in water. It appears to contain the constituent parts of the blood: examined under the microscope, it possesses globules, which differ from those of the blood in colour, but greatly resemble them in their general appearance. These globules float in a fluid which resembles se- rum in its coagulating by heat, as is easily seen by exposing pus in a spoon over the flame of a candle. Pus also contains abun- dance of fibrin: if water be poured upon pus until the solid part, which remains at the bottom of the vessel, be entirely deprived of its serum and globules, numerous portions of fibrin are found remaining; although not exactly of the same size, yet they have a great uniformity of appearance. Thus pus is com- posed of serum, fibrin, and globules; and if I were to hazard a theory upon this subject, I should say that pus was composed of the constituent parts of the blood, slightly changed in their character by inflammation. It does not appear to be prone to a putre- factive state ; and we therefore find, in its

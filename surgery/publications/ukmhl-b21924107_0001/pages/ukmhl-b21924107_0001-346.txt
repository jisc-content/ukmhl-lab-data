316 Danger at- tending wounds of the brain. not elevate the depressed bone; for where you do so^ you would, in all probability, give rise to extravasation, or increase the hazard of inflammation. The late Mr. Chandler had a patient in this Hospital who, on receiving a blow from a boat hook upon the parietal bone, had a portion of that bone driven into the brain, and at the same time a quantity of the brain was lost; at first there was hemi- plegia. The depressed bone was permitted to remain, and the individual recovered. The danger attending these injuries of the brain arises principally from two causes: viz. inflammation, and the formation of fun- gus. 1st. Inflammation; and 2d. Fungus; but both of these may be conquered by prompt and scientific measures. When the brain receives a wound, you must commence your curative exertions by abstracting as large a quantity of blood from the system as the constitution of your patient will bear; not, however, to such an extent as to prevent the restorative operations of na- ture. Do not lower the system to such a degree as to prevent inflammation altogether, as was done by the dresser in the other Hos- pital, whose partiality for bleeding I mentioned to you. Though you succeed in keeping down inflammation, yet fungus will arise, and here is a preparation of the disease to which I allude. Sometimes wounds of the brain ex-

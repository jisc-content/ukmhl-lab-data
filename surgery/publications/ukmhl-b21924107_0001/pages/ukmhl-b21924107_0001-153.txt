The character also or changed, of the matter becomes changed by local in- flammation. Thus we see serum substituted for pus^ or a red fluid;, composed of serum and red particles^ produced whilst inflamma- tion exists in the vicinity of a sore. - The fluid last described often irritates the surrounding skin and produces excoriation; but pus, when formed in its usual manner, is incapable of producing irritation on the sur- rounding parts, so that we see the skin for days, and even weeks, covered with the matter produced in compound fracture, yet it remains healthy; but let there be fever, or the irrita- tion of an exfoliating bone be present, and the skin soon becomes inflamed from the different quality of the fluid produced. That pus is formed by the action of ves- sels is well evinced by the changes which it undergoes in specific inflammations ; for then not only is pus produced, but matter possess- ing poisonous qualities. The matter of go- ofapoison- norrhoea is applied to the urethra, and a poi- sonous pus is secreted; and it will proceed for weeks, or even months, and be still capable of conveying a similar infection.

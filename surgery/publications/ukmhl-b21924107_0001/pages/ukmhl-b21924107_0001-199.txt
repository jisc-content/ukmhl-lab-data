169 elapsed since the case occurred, and the transaction is now almost buried in oblivion. The person who underwent the operation still lives, and is pleased with his improved legs ; and the Doctor lives also, and is well known to most of you, at least by name. Opium, when applied to the surface of sores, is very readily absorbed into the system. I believe that it is often a very useful applica- tion to the surface of wounds. A case of te- tanic affection happened in a child, whose leg had been * amputated by Mr. Lucas, the late surgeon of Guyâ€™s, and the application of opium to the stump gave more immediate relief than I ever remember to have witnessed. It relieved the spasms, and, as I believe, saved the child. If opium, applied to the surface of sores, be absorbed into the system, it pro- duces excessive costiveness, extreme pain in the head, and torpor of the system, which is only to be removed by the frequent adminis- tration of active purgatives. The effects on the constitution, when thus absorbed, are very much the same as when it is introduced into the stomach. I have known a solution of opium, applied upon an extensive scald in a child, destroy it *. * I have seen a temporary amaurosis produced in two cases, by the application of the extract of belladonna to the surface of irritable ulcers of a malignant character.

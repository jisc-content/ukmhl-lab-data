V DEAR SIR, “[1 HAVE looked over the manu- “ script of my Lectures on Surgery. It contains a faithful account of the “ principles of Surgery, which, for forty “ years, I have been endeavouring to “ learn, and of the practice which, for “ thirty-two years, I have been in the “ habit of teaching, in that school which “ is proud to rank amongst its Lecturers “ in Surgery the names of Cheselden, “ Sharp, Warner, Else, and last, al- “ though not least, of my most able and “judicious preceptor and predecessor, “ Mr. Cline. “ I am, “ Yours very truly. “ Astley Cooper.”

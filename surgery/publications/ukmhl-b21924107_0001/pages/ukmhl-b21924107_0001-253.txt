Gangrene is frequently the effect of a de- bilitated state of the constitution. Thus if a man has been confined by long continued fever, the nates are apt to slough, and become gangrenous, in consequence of the imperfect circulation, arising from the position in which he has been forced to remain. Some fevers have a greater tendency than others to pro- duce gangrene; as, for example, scarlatina. In slight cases of scarlatina, the most hor- rible effects will sometimes arise from gan- grene. The tonsils slough to a great extent; parts of the eustachian tube, and even of the tympanum, will separate, and large portions a of bone exfoliate. The worst effects of this kind are observed in those cases of scarlatina, in which the fever is not the most violent. The measles are very apt to be followed by sloughing. In this town it sometimes hap- pens, that a large blister applied to the chest of a child labouring under measles occasions a high degree of inflammation, producing gangrene, and endangering the life of the pa- tient. In constitutions of an unfavourable kind, I have seen the measles produce a 4 Gangrene the effect of debility.

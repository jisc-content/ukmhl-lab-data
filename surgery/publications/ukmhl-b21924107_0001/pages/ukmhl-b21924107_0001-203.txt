The vessels at the edge of the skin form Mode by granulations, and these unite with the granu- produced, lations of the surface of the sore; those pro- duced from the edge proceed towards the centre, and inosculate with the others on the surface of the sore, and are united by the ad- hesive process. The vessels become elon- gated from the edge of the sore, and proceed in radii from the circumference to the centre. Day after day an addition is thus made to the cicatrix, until at last the vessels reach the centre from every part of the circumference, when the process of cicatrization is com-’ pleted. It may be said by some persons, that this ,is not the only mode which nature takes for the formation of new skin, for it often hap- pens that the process of cicatrization coni- mences from the centre of the sore. If these persons mean to say that insulated portions of • skin are sometimes seen in the centre of sores - having no communication with its edges, there can be no doubt of the fact. But how does this happen ?, It is not that the centre of the sore has the power of formr ing new skin, but that the new skin in the

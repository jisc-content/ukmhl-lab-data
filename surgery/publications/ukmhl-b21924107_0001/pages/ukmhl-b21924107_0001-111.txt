81 and when used locally, the elFect on the part is precisely the same. Fomentations are ordered on the same principle, to relax the secreting extremities of the vessels, and produce perspiration of the surrounding parts ; by which tension is re- moved, and pain consequently abated. I do not think that medicated fomentations are preferable to mere warm water, unless the integuments be broken. With respect to poultices, they are used with the same views; to excite relaxation, and to produce secretion; the kind of poultice is of little consequence, if the integument be sound*. The next method of relieving inflamma- tion is, by the application of leeches: by ab- stracting blood from the vessels of the part, they lessen their diameters, and consequently diminish their distention and force of action ; they take away but little blood during the time they remain on the part; but consider- * Even when the integument is sound, I believe ano- dyne fomentations or poultices to be of considerable ser- vice in alleviating local irritation; and have known patients experience much benefit from their use, when common poultices have been applied without affording relief. If the iris can be affected by the application of belladonna to the eyebrow, or if preparations of lead are beneficial in inflammation when the surface is not broken, why may not anodynes allay irritation?â€”T.

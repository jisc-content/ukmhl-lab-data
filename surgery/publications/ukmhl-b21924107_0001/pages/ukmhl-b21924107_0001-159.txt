129 period of life, the portion of matter deposited by the arteries, and that taken into the system by the absorbent vessels, are as nearly as pos- sible balanced. In infancy a greater quantity is poured out by the arteries than the absorb- ents remove; but in age, a smaller quantity is deposited than absorption is taking away: thus the balance is destroyed in a different manner, at different periods of life; but when a considerable and unnatural absorption takes place of some part of the body, that absorp- tion is denominated ulceration. It was formerly thought, that it was ne- cessary to the ulcerative process that matter should be formed; but this opinion is not true, for ulceration often occurs without its being accompanied by any purulent secretion. The formation of matter, therefore, is not necessary, to the process of ulceration. The great cause of ulceration is inflam- mation united with pressure. If the inflam- mation be considerable, and the pressure but slight, ulceration will be produced; and if the pressure be very considerable, and the inflam- mation but slight, still there will be ulcera- tion. As a proof, both that pressure is the cause of ulceration, and that ulceration is not ne- cessarily accompanied with the formation of matter, I will give you an example in aneur- VOL. I.

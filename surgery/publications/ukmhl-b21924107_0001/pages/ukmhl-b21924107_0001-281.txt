I 251 between the integuments and subjacent fasciae, muscles, &c. I is destroyed; and I have thus seen nearly the whole of I the integument of the upper arm disunited from the parts ! beneath. I This form of inflammation differs from the true erysipe- j latous in the following particulars : The integument is not I at first affected, nor does it ever assume the florid colour ! which attends erysipelas: the constitutional symptoms do not precede the inflammation, but appear to be consequent on the local affection; it also always terminates in gangrene I of some portion of the cellular tissue, j The constitutional treatment is much the same as that required in erysipelas; but the local applications should oe employed with a view to promote the suppurative pro- cess (unless the inflammation be quite incipient.) For this purpose fomentations and poultices are proper. If the separation of cellular tissue has been extensive, great care must be taken to keep the disunited integument in contact with the subjacent parts, otherwise it will be very likely to slough: to effect this I have usually em- ployed strips of the soap cerate plaster, which are applied so as leave some of the openings uncovered, to allow of a g passage for the discharge, until the desired union has taken place,â€”T,

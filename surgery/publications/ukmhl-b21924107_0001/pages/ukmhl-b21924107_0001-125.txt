95 mation^ which occasions the two surfaces of this membrane to be firmly glued together. But the part of all others which is the most subject to this kind of inflammation is the pleura; and we rarely open a body of the adult without finding on the surfaces of this membrane some unnatural adhesions. The hearty in like manner^ is often glued to the pericardium, so that its cavity is some- times obliterated. And in the membranes of the brain we frequently meet with partial ad- hesions between the dura mater and tunica arachnoides. Thus, then, it will be seen that the serous membranes readily assume the adhesive in- flammation, by which they become perma- nently united to each other, or to the adja- cent parts: this is a most beautiful and wise provision of nature; for if the membranes of cavities, such as the pleura and peritoneum, instead of the adhesive were to produce the suppurative inflammation, effusion and death would be the frequent consequences; for example, matter would be often formed in the cavity of the pleura, and empyema would generally destroy. The urethra is generally affected by the suppurative inflammation. This is another of natureâ€™s benevolent and wise ordinances; had the outlets of our bodies been subject to 3 Oa the On the pe- ricardium and dura mater. On the urethra.

40 Cellular Membrane. Fasci2e mistaken for erysipe- las. it separates the cuticle in the form of a vesi- cation, which usually contains serum, but also, in some cases, fibrin; a serous effusion is also produced by it into the subjacent cel- lular tissue. In some instances, it is preceded by fever; in others, produces it. The skin is also liable to eruptions of various kinds; some acute, others chronic ; some constitu- tional, others local only; some devoid of any infectious quality, others strongly possess- ing it. In the cellular membrane inflammation produces an effusion, which obliterates or fills its cells; if it proceeds, it occasions suppu- ration and produces an abscess, the contents of which are discharged by the process of ulceration. In debilitated irritable constitu- tions, inflammation kills the cellular tissue, and produces carbuncle, which is a sloughy abscess in the cellular tissue: when chronic, it occasions tumours of various kinds, as the steatomatous or adipose; or, under peculiar circumstances, those of a malignant nature, as scirrhus, fungus, &c. Inflammation of fasciae is generally exten- sive, from the large surfaces they present; they are often seen inflamed in compound fracture, producing redness of the skin to a considerable distance, and it is a very un- favourable sign in this accident.

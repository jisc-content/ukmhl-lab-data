If, then, it be asked, in what does con- cussion consist? the answer is, that if it be slight, it is merely a disturbance of the* cir- culation in the brain; if violent, the brain is lacerated. A knowledge of this leads to a judicious treatment of the injury, as lace- ration of the brain is frequently followed by extravasation: and concussion in the com- mencement, may be compression in its result; TREATMENT OF CONCUSSION. The great danger which we have to guard against in the treatment of concussion, is inflammation of the brain. This principle must direct our practice; and in order to prevent inflammation, we must soon after the accident take away a very considerable quan- Bieeding. tity of blood. By bleeding largely, we not only remove existing inflammation, but we prevent that which would otherwise occur. This practice, however, may be carried to ex- cess. You must, in the repetition of bleeding, regulate your conduct by the symptoms; ob- serve whether there be any hardness in your patientâ€™s pulse, and whether he complains

This happens in irregularly formed sores, where the healing process has gone to the centre, and then the sore has broken out in the cir- cumference. If granulations arise from any portion of skin in the centre, these granula- tions form new skin, and an insulated portion of skin is produced, forming a part of the cicatrix. When a cicatrix is at first formed, it is extremely vascular; but if it has existed for any length of time, the blood vessels be- come contracted, and it is whiter than the original skin. Hence the white appearance of the cicatrices after small-pox; for, although they are more vascular than the original skin, when first formed; in a little time they lose their vascularity, and are endued with less living power than the surrounding parts. The readiness with which the surface of a sore is covered in by cicatrization, depends very much on its form. A sore of a circular form, requires a very considerable time before it will heal; whereas a sore of much greater length, but of less diameter, will heal more quickly.

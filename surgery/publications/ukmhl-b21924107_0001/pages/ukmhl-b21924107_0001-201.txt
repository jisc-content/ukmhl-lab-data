171 tient who had a compound fracture of the leg; the fracture was attended with abscess, and a small exfoliation of the bone took place. In this case, when a probe is put down into the cavity, the granulations from the cancellated structure of the bone are highly sensible. When the inflammation passes away, the sensibility of the part is diminished. The same thing happens with respect to granula- tions, springing from tendons, as the tendo Achillis, for instance, which are perfectly in- sensible. So granulations arising from fascia, and the aponeurosis of muscles, are endued with little sensibility. In general, therefore, although granulations springing from parts possessed of great sensibility, are exquisitely sensitive; those arising from parts in a great degree insensible or entirely so, as tendons, are not sensitive: a circumstance which you may have an opportunity of witnessing any time you visit these large hospitals. Granulations very readily unite with each other. The mode in which union is diiy unite, effected, is, by bringing the edges of the two granulating surfaces together, so as to pro- duce the adhesive process. The surface of the granulations is covered by adhesive matter, and you have only to apply the two surfaces to each other to produce an union. The knowledge of this principle is very often

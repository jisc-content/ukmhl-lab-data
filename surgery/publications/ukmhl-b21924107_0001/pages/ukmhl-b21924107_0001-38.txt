8 Case. A gentleman, of my acquaintance, was much annoyed by an ulcer on his chin, every attempt to heal which had proved abor- tive ; at length one of the neighbouring teeth became painful, and was in consequence extracted; when, to the great delight and astonishment of the gentleman, the ulcer on his chin healed rapidly. These cases are mentioned to show the necessity of seeking, with all possible care and attention, for the causes of irritation; as the removal of them is often alone sufficient to effect a cure, and always to afford relief, which would not otherwise arise. Most of you have probably experienced the suffering produced by the ir- ritation of an extraneous body lodging under the eyelid, and the instantaneous relief af- forded by its removal *. * A man, who was employed at a manufactory for fire-arms in the country, was struck by a small scale of metal in the eye; it penetrated the anterior part of the cornea, and became fixed between its laminae; it pro- duced considerable irritation and inflammation: numerous attempts were made to extract it, but without success, and the irritation and inflammation increased in spite of the very active means used to subdue them. After a few days he was sent to town, with a note, requesting I would give him my assistance; with some little difficulty I suc- ceeded in removing the foreign body from the cornea, when the irritation and inflammation quickly subsided, and in a few days he again returned to the country with only a small speck on the cornea, in the situation of the wound.-T. 2

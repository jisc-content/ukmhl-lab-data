185 The lint^ by its pressure, prevents the growth of granulations in the centre, while the unc- tuous substance allows the granulations on the edge to proceed, and inosculate with those on the surface of the sore. The lint should not be applied to the edge; for if it be, the granulations will be prevented from pro- ceeding towards its centre. The nitrate of silver, and the sulphate of copper, are em- ployed for the purpose of destroying luxuriant granulations near the edges of the ulcer. Lint is, therefore, applied to the centre of the sore, for the purpose of keeping down the granula- tions on the surface; whereas the caustic is applied on its circumference, to check the too rapid growth of the granulations which are nearest the edge of the sore. Thus the ' healing of the sore is promoted, and a little circle is formed by the caustic from day to " day, until it arrive at the centre. Adhesive plaster is also used to press down the granulations. The common adhe- ' sive plaster is, however, too stimulating for this purpose; a plaster composed of equal parts of the emplastrum thuris compositum and the emplastrum saponis, is a much better plaster to promote the healing of ulcers, than the common adhesive plaster. This is a point deserving attention; because if the applica-

57 receiving a red particle, or particles of blood, which gradually advance in them, forced for- wards by a vis-a-tergo, until they reach, the beginning of the corresponding vein ; and then this vessel being larger than the artery, the red particles rush from the artery into it, and thus a new vessel appears to be created under the eye. It is not, however, a new vessel, but a serous artery, which, by the force of the action of the heart and of the surrounding vessels, becomes dilated, so as to receive red particles. When the red particles are observed in the vessel, they seem to ad- vance by the pulsation of the heart, and then slightly to retreat; but not in proportion to their advance,â€™ and thus they gradually pro- ceed. The vessels of the inflamed part, on this account, appear to become more numerous; but it is only that they can now be seen from the difference of the fluid which they contain. They become very considerably dilated, and they seem disposed rather to yield than to contract. This is what can be with certainty observed in these animals. With respect to man, we observe, that if a drop of nitric acid be applied on any part of the body, in three or four minutes a rush of blood takes place into the part, and it be- comes red.

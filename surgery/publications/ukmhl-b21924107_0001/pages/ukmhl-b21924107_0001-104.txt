74 Anecdote. violence of the inflammation, or of altogether subduing it, much has been said. Cold is not a positive quality, but the abstraction of heat in inflammation affords much relief. If cold be applied to the body generally, it has the power of lessening the frequency of the pulse in an extraordinary degree. I tried this upon myself: I went out of my house one severely cold evening, when I was very warm, my pulse being 86®; at the expiration of an hour it was 76®, and at the end of an hour more it was reduced to 65®; it had not only lessened in quickness but in fulness. Cold will pro- duce torpor of body and mind, by diminish- ing the excitability of the nervous system: in extreme, it occasions death. A curious instance of this kind occurred in Nova Scotia; Dr. Scott had been dining with some friends, a short distance from Halifax, and they were on their return home at night, when one of the party sepa- rated from the rest, having said to a com- panion that he would frighten some of them by-and-by. However, they reached Halifax without seeing any thing more of him on the journey, and he had not arrived: at this the party became alarmed, and returned for the purpose of finding him; he was discovered behind a hillock of snow, apparently asleep, in the erect position, but quite dead.

In the dissection of a per- Appearance son who died of erysipelas in the arm, the on dissec- cuticle was separated, the skin was filled with blood, and was much thickened; the cellular membrane immediately under the skin was loaded with serum, and so was that membrane in and between the muscles to the bone. The head seems to be more commonly of frequent affected by it than any other part; it often on the head, succeeds the most trifling injury of the scalp; and, like carbuncle, when it occurs in this situation, generally destroys life. I had the misfortune to lose a lady of considerable con- sequence from its effects, after the removal of a small encysted tumour from the head. It made its appearance three days after the operation, and all the skilful attention of Dr. Baillie was unable to arrest its progress. Thus a trifling operation on the scalp de- stroyed life, in consequence of having been succeeded by erysipelatous inflammation *. After a person has once had this disease. Having he is very subject to repetition of it; and some ed iLasii'y persons appear to be much predisposed to its agahr"^"^ formation. * As I shall hereafter more particularly mention, I have some doubts whether inflammations on the head fol- lowing slight wounds are truly erysipelatous or not.

Take away blood, and purge your patient freely, and see how far the symptoms may be the result of concussion of the brain, and not of depression. If the symptoms do not yield to depletion, then, and not till then, perform Case. the operation of trephining. I was called to a lady who had fallen against a projection in a wall, in walking across her parlour. The os frontis was driven in, but there were no symptoms of compression of the brain. I bled her, and guarded cautiously against in- flammation, but there was no necessity for elevating the portion of the bone.

This is putting the patient to considerable hazard; for the simple fracture would, by the incision, be rendered compound. In simple fracture, then, when it is attended with symptoms of injury

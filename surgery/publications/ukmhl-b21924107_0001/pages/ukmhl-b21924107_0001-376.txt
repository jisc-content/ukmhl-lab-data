346 edge as it can with safety; by this means the portion of bone removed will be in size ' very little more than that of half of the circle of the instrument. As soon as the teeth of the trephine have entered the bone, and made sufficient way to prevent the instrument from slipping, the pin is to be raised, and the saw- ing continued. I never saw the pin do any mischief; but my nephew once witnessed an operation in which it perforated the dura ma- ter, the surgeon having forgotten to raise it. When using the saw, let your bearing on it be as equal as possible, and the motion such as the radius will permit, the ulna being fixed: as you proceed in the operation you must frequently introduce a probe into the groove made by the saw, to ascertain how far you have proceeded. In operating on persons of middle age, you may know that you are more than half through by the bleed- ing which takes place when the diploe is wounded; but in very young or old persons, in whose skulls little or no diploe exists, a few turns of the saw are sufficient to penetrate both tables of the cranium. When you have sawn through at one part, introduce the ele- vator, separate the remaining part, and raise the bone, which may be easily accomplished, and will prevent the danger of wounding the dura mater.

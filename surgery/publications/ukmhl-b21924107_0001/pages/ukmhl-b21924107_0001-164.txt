134 New parts prone to ul- ceration. Examples. sess more equality of circulation, and of tem- perature. Another reason is, that the adhe- sive process glueing the more internal parts to each other, they become united, and in this way form a considerable solid; but the more external surfaces have no such support. An instance of this is found in the adhesion of the pleura to a lung, so as to form one struc- ture. It may be considered, then, as a law of the animal economy, that the ulcerative process has a disposition towards the nearest external surface of the body. Those parts of the body which are newly formed, are more liable to be absorbed than those which have long existed. A part co- vered by a cicatrix proceeds rapidly to ulcer- ation, because it is more weakly constituted than those which have existed longer. The irritability of a part is proportional to its weakness; and those which are weak and irritable, fall most readily into the ulcerative process. To take a familiar illustration; when a child labours under symptoms of constitu- tional derangement in dentition, you cut its gums? You do so, not for the purpose of making an immediate passage for the tooth, but because, when the gum by the adhesive process heals, a cicatrix is produced by this little operation which is very readily absorb-

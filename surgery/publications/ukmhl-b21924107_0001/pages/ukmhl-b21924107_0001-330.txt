The next subject to which I shall direct your attention is^ fracture with depression. I will tell you what you ought to do in such cases, and leave you to act for yourselves. In order to ascertain the symptoms aris- ing from depression, I tried the following ex- periment : I applied the trephine to the cra- nium of a large dog, and took out a portion of bone. I then with the handle of a knife separated the dura mater from the bone; for I found that I could make no impression on the brain until I had done so, and then pressed upon it with my finger.

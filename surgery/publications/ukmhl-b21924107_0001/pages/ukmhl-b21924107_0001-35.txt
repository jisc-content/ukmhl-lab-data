Irritation is generally communicated through the medium of the nerves, of which there are two systems in the body; the first, composed of the brain, spinal marrow, and their nerves, which naturally convey sensa- tion and volition ; the second, consisting of the grand sympathetic nerve, the centre of which is behind the stomach, in the semilu- nar ganglion and solar plexus. The modes of sympathetic communication are various. In some instances, the course of irritation is from the irritated part to the sentient extre- mity of the nerve, as the pain experienced in the knee and foot from a disease of the hip; or the pain in the little finger and half of the ring finger, when the ulnar nerve is struck at the elbow: injuries of the brain produce vomiting, their influence being imparted to the stomach through the medium of the eighth pair of nerves. In other cases, the course of sympathy is from the affected part to the origin of the nerve; thus pain in the loins is consequent on diseased testicle ; or pain be- B 3 Course of irritation.

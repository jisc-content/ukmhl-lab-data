46 Membranes. Healthy in- flammation. ing into its composition, is, like other ,parts of the body, liable to inflammation, which produces adhesion of bone to bone; and in fractures, the adhesion or union of the broken portions: in suppurative inflammation, ab- scesses ; and by ulceration is the matter dis- charged : death, or mortification of bone, is also the frequent result of inflammation ; and the dead bone sloughs, or exfoliates, whilst new bone supplies the place of that which is removed, or is to be separated. Exhalent membranes, when they inflame, are naturally disposed to adhere; whilst mu- cous surfaces, under inflammation, pass into the suppurative inflammation. This circum- stance was first clearly explained by Mr. Hunter, and since has been dilated upon by Bichat. Inflammation is healthy or unhealthy; it has been too much regarded as a disease, for no wound can be repaired without inflamma- tion ; even the little puncture, made by the lancet in bleeding, would inevitably destroy life if this salutary process did not prevent it. A slight inflammatory action throws upon the edges of the wound adhesive matter, by which they are permanently united and the divided parts closed. So, when a ligature is put upon an artery, unless inflammation supervened it could be of no use in pre- 2

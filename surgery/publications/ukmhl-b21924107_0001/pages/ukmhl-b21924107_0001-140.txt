If a poultice be applied to such a wound, or fomentations be used, a suppurative inflammation will follow on the synovial sur- face; the cartilages become absorbed, and the bones ulcerated; a profuse discharge en- sues ; the constitution becomes extremely irritated; chills, succeeded by burning heat, and profuse perspiration, frequently follow each other; and a person, just previously in the finest health, is precipitated into a state of extreme emaciation. Sometimes the joint, after weeks or even months have elapsed, gradually heals by granulation, with entire loss of motion, or a great diminution of it. If, on the contrary, the surgeon brings the edges of the wound immediately together, and takes advantage of the adhesive inflam- mation to close the wound, the patient escapes from local or constitutional irritation, and in a fortnight is free from danger, and has scarcely suffered from the injury.

218 Separation of tlie skin. The first appearance which we observe after the destruction of the life of any part, is a white line which nature forms for the sepa- ration of the dead from the living parts; for this white line we anxiously look, since it is the barrier which nature sets up between the dead and living parts, and it becomes a cri- terion of the cessation of the gangrenous dis- position. At this white line the cuticle is raised. This elevation of the cuticle is, a ve- sication which forms a line of circumvallation around the gangrene. When the cuticle be- comes separated, as it will in two or three days, we find a chasm beneath it produced by the absorption of the living skin, which was in contact with the dead. The living skin is taken up by the absorbent vessels into the constitution, and in this manner the dead parts are separated by a process of nature. If we were to reason, a priori, on this subject, it might be expected, that the absorbent ves- sels would rather remove the dead portion of skin in contact with the living; but this is not the case. The absorbent vessels act on the living parts, and not on the dead; nor is the dead skin absorbed after the granulations have formed, but it becomes loose, and ceases to attach itself to the surrounding parts; the chasm formed by the absorbent vessels causing the separation.

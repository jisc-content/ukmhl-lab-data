Case. 341 On the 8th of June, the son of Mr. J. S. Rochester to spend a little time with some friends: we told him that he might, if he would pay attention to himself, keep his bowels open, and regulate his diet. After the lapse of a few days, he became extremely ill with inflammation of the brain, and he died. On inquiry, we found that he had neglected the directions given him, and allowed his bowels to be costive. The following case also shows the neces- sity of keeping the patient from any exertion. fell from a ladder on some spikes, one of which penetrated his skull. The wound bled freely, and a considerable portion of the sub- stance of the brain came away, also seve- ral portions of bone, when the wound was enlarged to ascertain the extent of injury: he was insensible at times for several days after the accident. On the 27th, he walked a mile to the house of his medical attendant, Mr. Bethune, of Brighton, and appeared in a very favourable state for recovery. He had been particularly cautioned as to the necessity of his refraining from all kinds of exertion. On his return home, his brothers were play- ing at cricket, when he imprudently and un- fortunately joined them. Inflammation of the brain was the consequence, of which he died in two days. z 3

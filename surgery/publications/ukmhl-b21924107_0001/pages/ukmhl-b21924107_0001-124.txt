It lias been said, that the adhesive matter is albu- men ; but it has been proved not to be so. Dr. Bostock, who lectured on chemistry several years at Guyâ€™s Hospital, took great pains to investigate its nature, and published on the subject. Mr. Dowler made many experiments for the same purpose, and found it to be decidedly fibrin. Mr. Hunter called it coagulated lymph: this certainly was not a very appropriate term. I shall call it adhesive matter from its effect in inflam- mation, and by which fibrin is to be under- stood. Some of the exhalent surfaces of the body naturally secrete a watery fluid, and are called serous; while others, separate mu- cus. The cellular membrane is one of the former, and exhales a fluid somewhat re- sembling serum ; it contains much less albu- men. This membrane is prone to the adhe- sive inflammation. The vessels which usually secrete the fluid just mentioned, pour out fibrin under inflammation, and which, be- coming coagulated, produces the hardness that we usually find in inflamed parts. The membrane which doubly covers the intestines (the peritoneum) is a serous sur- face, often affected by the adhesive inflam-

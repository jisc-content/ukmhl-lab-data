70 Nausea. Case. creased, and the artery at the wrist was raised with a jerk at each pulsation; he was quickly relieved by taking Dover s powder with calo- mel. The inflammation in such cases is sup- ported by the irritability of the system. There is another mode of subduing in- flammation, by giving a solution of tartar emetic, in small doses, so as to create a constant state of nausea. This plan is often successful in croup; but calomel is also to be occasionally administered. When inflammation occurs in old people, you must bleed with the greatest caution. An elderly lady, having inflamed lungs, was ordered to be bled; the bleeding was repeat- ed, and effusion into the cellular texture of the legs soon followed. Digitalis was pre- scribed for her, combined with spir. aether nitric, which reduced the inflammation, oc- casioned the absorption of the fluid in the legs, and she rapidly recovered. The means, therefore, which are employed to lessen or remove inflammation are those which restore the secretions, by opening the extremities of the arteries; and thus the heart is prevented from propelling the blood with violence to any particular part of the body.

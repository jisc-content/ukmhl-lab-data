248 ascertain whether the antiphlogistic, or tonic, mode of treatment was best for this disease; therefore he put two persons into adjoining beds, having erysipelas; to one of whom, after purging him, were given tonics, and a generous diet; to the other, saline medicines, and low diet, blood likewise was abstracted from the latter; they both recovered; the grenous, and he was altogether weaker. He was ordered to take the quinine every four hours, to have beef steaks daily, with another pint of porter, to continue the calomel and opium, and also the spirit wash, excepting to the foot, which was to be poulticed. 11th. The calomel omitted, as his mouth became slightly affected. 12th. To continue and have four ounces of sherry in addition. 13th. Another pint of porter was ordered. From this period he continued to improve, and he took daily beef steaks, three pints of porter, four ounces of sherry, also the sulphate of quinine, every four hours, and the opium at night; the slough on the foot separated quickly from the application of the nitric acid lotion, and the erysipelas gradually disappeared, causing a loss of the cuticle. Matter formed in the cellular texture on the calf of the leg and at the under part of the thigh; it was discharged by incision, and the parts quickly healed. At one time the erysipelas extended from the toes of the right lower extremity, to the occiput, occupying the whole of the limb, the back and nates, and reaching as far on the abdomen of the same side as the linea alba. I attribute the favourable termination of this case in great measure, to the judicious employment of the sulphate of quinine, by my colleague, Dr. Elliotson, which appeared to give tone and vigour to the system, as well as to allay the nervous irritability, so constantly attending this form of inflammation.â€”T.

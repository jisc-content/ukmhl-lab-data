60 Its modus operandi. Indication for bleed- ing. Fainting, however, cannot be easily pro- duced, unless the patient be in the erect or sitting position whilst the blood is abstract- ed; for it is the loss of this fluid by the ves- sels of the brain, which is the immediate cause of fainting. To prove this, when a per- son faints, place him in a recumbent position, and let his head be situated a little lower than his body, to facilitate the passage of the blood to the brain, and in a very short time after being thus placed he will open his eyes, and all his faculties will return. The second mode by which bleeding re- lieves, is by lessening the momentum of the circulation; for when there is great distension of the blood vessels, the momentum will be necessarily great, and consequently the vital fluid will be thrown with great force, not only on the inflamed part, but on all the organs of the body. The indication for general bleeding is a hard pulse. In this state of pulse the dia- meter of the vessel is diminished, yet its ac- tion is exceedingly strong, and each pulsation feels like the vibration of a wire; therefore, when you find this description of pulse, you will be justified in taking away blood. The hardest pulse is that which is produced by in- flammation of the heart; in inflammation of the lungs and of the brain the pulse is hard.

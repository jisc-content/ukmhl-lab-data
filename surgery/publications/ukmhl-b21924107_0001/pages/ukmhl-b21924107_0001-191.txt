The layer of fibrin, or adhesive matter, soon becomes vascular; for blood vessels, which are elongations of the vasa vasorum of the divided arteries and veins, are forced by the action of the heart into the* fibrin which has been deposited, and this layer consequently becomes organised. The difference between the mode of union by adhesion and granulation is, that, in the lat- ter, the vessels shoot through the layer which has been thrown out, terminating by open mouths on the surface of the newly- formed substance, and secreting pus, at the same time that more fibrin is effused. The fibrin, which is poured out with this purulent secretion from the vessels, forms a second layer, into which the vessels supporting the first deposit of fibrin become elongated, and are the means of supporting the second cover- ing, terminating as before, by open mouths on the surface of the substance effused. In this manner layer after layer is formed until the cavity becomes filled. The difference in the process maybe easily explained. Suppose an abscess be opened; the result is, that adhesive inflammation is produced on the internal surface of the cavity. A layer of adhesive matter is thrown out; and if the sides of the abscess are brought together by a roller, you may often prevent VOL. 1. M

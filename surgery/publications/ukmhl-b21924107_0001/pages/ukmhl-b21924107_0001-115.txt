85 scrotum will often cure an inflammation of the testicle. It is curious to observe, that still a similar advantage is derived from coun- ter irritation in parts that have no immediate connexion. In inflammation of the lungs, a blister applied on the chest (parts between which there is no direct communication) will assist in checking the disease; blisters on the forepart of the abdomen are very beneficial in inflammation of the liver, intestines, &c. Blisters are more frequently used for ex- citing counter irritation than any other means. Issues and setons are sometimes adopted; they were formerly much employed as counter irritants; but they often produce too much, and also irritative fever, and thus add to the original malady they were intended to subdue. Counter irritants must never disturb the con- stitution. Sometimes after a blister has been removed, it may be necessary to keep up the irritation and discharge; to accomplish this, the cuticle w^hich has been raised by the blis- ter must be removed, and the exposed surface dressed with the savine ointment*. I * In some persons the employment of cantharides to s produce counter irritation, occasions considerable irritation of the urinary organs, amounting, in some cases, to stran - gury : this more frequently happens, when the cantharides are applied with a view to promote discharge from a raw surface.â€”T.

In tendons, for instance, it will be much less than in muscles. This process is of the greatest possible importance in surgery. It ought, therefore, to command much of your attention; and it will be unfortunate for you if you do not understand it. Without this process no ope- ration could be attended with success: its absence, even after bleeding, would destroy life. Bear this principle in mind, endeavour to effect union by adhesion.

Suppose you were called to a compound fracture, what would you do? Endeavour, certainly, by bringing the parts together, to make it simple fracture. Within these few days

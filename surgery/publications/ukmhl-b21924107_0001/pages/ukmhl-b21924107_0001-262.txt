Treatment when gan- grene has commen- ced. his bed side, pour the camphorated spirit into your hand, and rub it on his feet with the utmost possible gentleness, so that the part may not be irritated by violent friction. When the first effects of cold are removed, it will be proper to apply poultices to the part. The poultices must be cold, for warm applications are to be carefully avoided. One of the most valuable of our nobility died of gangrene from an imprudence in this respect. He was out shooting in December last, and his feet having become benumbed, he put them into warm water as soon as he re- turned home. The consequence was, that his toe became gangrenous; gangrene also oc- curred in the other foot, and he died from its effects. When parts are frost-bitten in colder climates, you are aware that the common practice is to restore the circulation by rubbing them with snow. The friction is a stimulus, which the melting snow mo- derates. But so soon as gangrene has commen- ced, it will be necessary to apply a gentle stimulus, with a view of supporting the action of the surrounding parts which are threatened with the destruction of life. The application which is found to be most uni- formly successful in sucli cases, is the poul-

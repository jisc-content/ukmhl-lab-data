188 Inflamed istate of the Ulcer. It will be highly useful in these cases to employ some stimulating plaster, such as em- plastrum galbani compositum, for the adhe- sive plaster will not always answer the pur- pose, when sores are languid, and the object is to increase the action in the part: this will also be greatly assisted by giving the patient a nutritious diet, allowing him, at the same time, to take exercise; and, in fact, doing every thing to improve the constitution. The inflamed ulcer we shall next describe. When the surgeon goes round the hospital on the first day after the admission, he will meet with a number of persons with inflamed ulcers on their legs; and what is the character of these sores? There is a discharge from these wounds, composed of serum, and the red particles of the blood, with a disposition ointment creates irritation, which is proved by the good effects resulting from the application of a lotion, possessing the same medicinal properties, as an ointment which has previously caused irritation. When an ulcer is deep or irregular, it is difficult to place a dressing of ointment in contact with its whole surface, consequently it only acts partially, and besides, by adhering to the edges of the wound, and the surrounding parts, much time is necessa- rily required at each dressing to remove it. Lotions will effect every thing that can be done by ointments in these cases; they have the advantage of being readily applied to the whole surface, and are more cleanly. â€”T.

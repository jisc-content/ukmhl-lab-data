34 after, she was brought to my house in Broad Street, in a high state of fever, with delirium, frequently muttering, Pray do not put me into the cellar!” and when I inquired the reason, I found that the parents had learnt the punishment to which she had been sub- jected. I ordered what I conceived likely to relieve the fever, but the child died in a week after this unfeeling conduct. The following is also a curious example, given in the words of the child, aged ten years. I wanted to write my exercise, and to scrape my slate pencil, aiid went into the school in the dark to fetch my knife; when one of my school-fellows burst from behind the door, to frighten me. I was exceedingly terrified, and it made my head ache.' On the following day I became deaf; and, on the next, so deaf as not to hear the loudest talking.” In this state she continued in June 1824, three months after having been frightened; at which time I saw her. She had been pre- viously under the care of Mr. Hodgson, of Birmingham.

127 Dr. Babington and myself attended a gen- case, tleman in Cheapside^ in whom I also found matter upon the surface of the brain^ from an arrest of secretion of matter from his ear. We also attended together^ in St. Paul’s Churchyard, a similar case, in which matter was found between the dura mater and sur- face of the brain. Dr. Cholmely examined a woman in Guy’s case. Hospital, who died from a similar disease. I can call to mind eight cases of inflamma- tion of the fcrain, produced by suppression of suppuration in the ear With respect to the treatment of suppu- ration, it consists principally in the applica- tion of fomentations and poultices; but we shall treat of this subject more particularly when we describe abscesses. * It is curious for how long a period these chronic suppurations will continue. The following is an extract of a letter which I received from a village in Carmarthenshire. An attack of scarlet fever, at ten years of age, “ left me extremely deaf in my left ear, and with a discharge of matter from it, vvhich has continued ever since; I am now thirty-seven years of age. In the course of the time that has elapsed, I recollect the discharge having been more than usual about four or six times, which continued about a day, and was always attended with a dead aching pain in my head,’’ &c. &c.

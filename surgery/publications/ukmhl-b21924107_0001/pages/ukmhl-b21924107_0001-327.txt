Mr. Chandler, late surgeon of this Hospital, ad- mitted a case of this description, which hap- pened by the fall of a shutter on the summit of the head; there did not appear to be any extravasation or concussion; great irritation and inflammation succeeded, which destroyed the patient; and after death it was discovered that there existed a complete circular frac- ture of the skull, and that the anterior por- tion could be freely separated from the poste- rior, from the vertex through the sphenoid bone. The skull is in the collection. A curious fracture of the skull occasion- ally happens over the frontal sinuses. When the fracture is simple, if the nose be blown, the air escapes through the opening in the bone into the cellular membrane under the skin, and renders the forehead emphyse- matous. If, on the other hand, the fracture be compound, upon blowing the nose, the air rushes through the wound; so that in either case the nature of the accident may be easily ascertained. Large portions of bone are sometimes de- tached from the skull, instead of being de- pressed ; this was the case with a nobleman^

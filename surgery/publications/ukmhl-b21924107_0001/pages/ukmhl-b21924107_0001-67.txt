Increased heat:—Mr. Hunter denied Heat, this: he made an incision, two inches deep, in the gluteal muscles of an ass, and into the wound he introduced a tin canula, 1^ inch long, so that there was half an inch of wound below the canula; he then passed a plug of wood through the canula to the bot- tom of the wound, and confined it there, so as to prevent an union of the muscles: this was on a Wednesday. Immediately after the wound was made, a thermometer was intro- duced into it, and the mercury rose to 100® exactly, as another did at the same time, which had been passed into the vagina. On the next morning the plug was taken out, and the ball of the thermometer introduced to the bottom of the wound; the mercury rose to 100®: the plug was then again re- turned, and secured as before. In the even- ing the experiment was repeated with the same result. On Friday morning, the thermome- ter, when introduced, rose to OO"" only ; and, in the evening, it rose to 101^"^. On Satur- day morning, when introduced again, the 1 mercury reac^ied 99®: in the evening 100®. Similar experiments were made on dogs, ! with the same results. ! D 3

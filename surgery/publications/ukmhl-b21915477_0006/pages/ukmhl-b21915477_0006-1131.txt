LATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE. 1071 subjects who are afflicted with lateral curvature, the development of which is accompanied by debility, or who, being already afflicted with curvature, are exposed to causes which'induce a weak state of health, and give rise to lateral bending of the spine in addition to the previously existing structural deformity. The analysis of such cases is quite simple: we have only to note the condition of the spine and trunk when the patient is standing up, and then to observe the effect produced by causing her to stoop forwards; the differences of deformity existing in these two attitudes will be the amount depending upon lateral bending, the permanent state of distortion when the spine is bent being alone due to lateral curvature. In the case shown in Fig. 0044, there was marked rotation of the vertebrae to the right side from the third to the eleventh dorsal, and the same condition towards the left side from the twelfth dorsal to the last lumbar. Etiology of Lateral Curvature of the Spine.â€”The great diversity of opinion that exists upon the subject of the causation of lateral curvature, has already been alluded to, and it lias been noted that this want of concord has been ascribed to the fact that in the investigation of this question the surgeon, being unable to obtain for necroscopic examination a spine in the early stage of deformity, is compelled to a great extent to base his theories upon specu- lation. It is, however, probable that were this difficulty removed, post-mor- tem examination might lead to no satisfactory results, for the changes which occur in the spine and surrounding structures are essentially such as belong to vital action, and even the microscope might fail to detect changes which nevertheless, during life, seriously influenced the functional properties of the affected tissues. It is scarcely necessary to point out that, in spite of all the appliances for skilled investigation with which science can supply us, changes do occur in living tissues which, although sufficient to destroy vitality, are yet undemonstrable after death. Of the many theories that have been advanced as to the etiology of lateral curvature, it is difficult to select one that satisfactorily accounts for the development of the deformity ; most careful investigation is still required of this subject, and our efforts must be directed to determine whether the distortion is consequent upon changes in the column itself, which render it unfit to fulfil its physiological functions as a supporting column, or whether the curvature results from external influ- ences which act upon the spine and disturb its adjustment, or, again, whether it is a combination of these processes which gives rise to the deformity. The development of lateral curvature is by recent authors usually ascribed to the action of causes which are not of innate, but of external, origin ; by earlier writers the curvature was considered to be dependent upon changes in the bones, variously described as of an inflammatory, rachitic, or scrofulous nature ; a better knowledge of the morbid anatomy of this deformity, together with the production of evidence of the fact that curvature often ex- ists in a spine the bones of which are in no way affected beyond being displaced from their normal positions, disproves the truth of these early theories. When referring to the history of orthopaedic surgery, it was remarked that the scientific treatment of deformities had been developed from the introduction of subcutaneous tenotomy, which had been first successfully employed in the treatment of club-foot. The fact that the latter distortion was directly dependent upon muscular contraction, led investigators to con- clude that other deformities of the body probably arose from the same cause ; this no doubt influenced their judgment, and suggested the theory that lateral curvature, not being due to disease of the bones of the spine, was necessarily of external origin, and that t>f all forces acting upon the spine,

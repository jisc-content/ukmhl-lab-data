1023 CLUB-FOOT. is then withdrawn, and one with a blunt point is entered through the punc- ture, slipped through the opening made in the sheath, and passed between the tendon and the bone; the flat side of the blade has been so far kept towards the tendon, but the cutting edge is now turned, and, the assistant abducting and Hexing the foot to render the tendon tense, a few strokes of the knife readily effect its division. The tibialis anticus tendon is next divided, the point selected being just in front of the ankle-joint; and in seeking for this tendon it must be remem- bered that it is displaced to the inner side of the leg. The child is turned slightly over on his back; a small, sharp-pointed tenotome is entered on the outer side, so as to avoid the dorsalis pedis artery, and passed beneath the tendon; this is always considerably contracted, and, on turning the cutting edge of the knife, is usually divided by simple pressure; the assistant should slightly extend the foot, but should not exercise any force, as from the length of this tendon the divided ends separate very much after the section is com- pleted. The small wounds made during the operations are closed with pads of lint directly after the knife has been withdrawn; the leg is then carefully bandaged; and a flexible splint, bent to a degree corresponding to the original condition of deformity, is fixed to the leg and foot. The division of the tibialis anticus tendon is an operation which presents no difficulty; the only practical points deserving notice are, first, that the knife must be entered on the outer side of the tendon, as otherwise the dorsalis pedis artery is almost sure to be cut, and secondly, that the assistant must not make too forcible extension of the foot, for this little tendon flies asunder so readily that the knife is liable to be jerked through the skin, making an open wound. The section of the tibialis posticus tendon is not so simple a matter, on account of the depth at which it is situated, and of the close proximity of the posterior tibial artery. It is probable that this vessel is not unfrequently wounded by those not well practised in the method of dividing the tendon: no harm is likely to result if the artery is cut com- pletely through when severing the tendon with a blunt-pointed knife; but if it be pricked with the sharp-pointed tenotome, a traumatic aneurism will pro- bably be formed. I believe that I have divided this artery on two occasions; at any rate, on withdrawing the knife a spurt of arterial blood issued through the puncture in both cases; pressure was applied, and maintained by pads of lint for six days, and no harm followed upon the accident. In these opera- tions the blunt-pointed tenotome was used ; both of the children were puny little infants with very small legs. In robust, well-developed children, the use of the blunt-pointed knife is not so necessary, because the distance between the artery and tendon is greater; it is however safer to use the blunt tenotome if the operator is not often in the habit of performing the operation. The section of the tendon is not plainly recognized when completed, as in the case of the tibialis anticus tendon, and this difference is due to the fibres of the posterior muscle being prolonged down to the point at which the section of the tendon is made; for this reason, care must be taken to effect the divi- sion as low down the leg, and as near the ankle, as can be done without risk of injuring the posterior tibial artery. The inner border of the tibia is the guide by which the tendon is found; the sharp-pointed tenotome will strike this part of the bone if it be entered exactly in the middle line of the leg; if the proper spot be missed, a little careful manipulation, using the point of the knife as a probe, will find the edge of the bone; the sheath "of the ten- don is then opened, and when the blunt-pointed knife is passed through this and between the tendon and the bone, it will be held firmly between those structures, and the operator may feel assured that the blade is in the right position for completing the section.

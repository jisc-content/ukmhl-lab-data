720 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITALS. Fig. 1405. Vesico-vaginal fistula ; freshening the edges. Verneuil recommends for this purpose a thin rubber bag with tube and stopcock, which can be introduced empty and can be subsequently distended with air, being allowed to collapse again before removal. It is better to begin the denudation at the most dependent part of the fistula, and to ascend from it, so that the flow of blood may not conceal the tissues to be cut. A tenaculum is used to catch the vaginal wall at the point of beginning, and the operator holds this with his left hand so as to make'the part slightly tense, and thus facilitate the use of the scissors.

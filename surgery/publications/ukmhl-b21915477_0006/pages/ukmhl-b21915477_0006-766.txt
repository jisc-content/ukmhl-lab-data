INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITALS. 706 the feet, and also of the vulva; the disease of the latter appeared as two tumors, one on either side of the vulva, each being as large as an infant’s head, and measuring more than thirteen inches in circumference, four inches in transverse diameter, and seven inches in height. The tumors of elephan- tiasis temporarily increase in size during menstruation, and in pregnancy. In some cases the origin of the disease may be traced to an injury, while in others it has been attributed to eczema, erysipelas, or syphilis. The skin is greatly thickened, and abundant proliferation of its constituents occurs, while the lymph-spaces and lympli-vessels are greatly dilated. Elephantiasis may be confounded with condylomata, or with lupus. From the former, it is distinguished by there being present changes in the tissues beneath the tumors, in elephantiasis ; from the latter, by the ulceration in elephantiasis being superficial and healing spontaneously, while those of lupus are deeper and progressive. Medical treatment is without avail, and the only remedy is extirpation of the diseased mass. If this be pedunculated, a double ligature may be applied, and then excision effected with scissors or knife. When the growth has a broad base, the thermo-cautery, the galvano-cautery,1 the ecraseur, the elastic ligature, scissors, or the scalpel, may be used. If the form of the tumor permit, Fig. 1399. Elephantiasis of the vulva. (After Schroeder.) the method of McGregor2 may be followed; he applied Esmarch’s band- age, so that the operation was made almost bloodless, though the tumor was a very large one, and though twenty vessels were tied. If the tumor be removed by the knife, bleeding vessels should be tied at once, or hsemo- 1 In Bourguet’s case (Gazette des Hopitaux, 1867), operated on with the ecraseur, the bladder was injured, and death from peritonitis occurred on the third day. 2 Glasgow Medical Journal, 1879.

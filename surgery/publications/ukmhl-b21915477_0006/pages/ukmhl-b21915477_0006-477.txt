Exploration of tiie Urethra and Bladder. Direct inspection of the genital organs and of the hypogastric region may inform us in regard to certain lesions of the urethra and bladder, such as vices of conformation, wounds, and fistulse. In women this inspection de- mands the employment of the speculum, which exposes the vesico-vaginal septum and the posterior wall of the urethra. Palpation of the lower surface of the penis, or of the perineum, sometimes discloses the presence of lesions situated in the penile and perineal portions of the urethral canal (stricture, calculus); and, combined with percussion, makes i+ possible to estimate the state of distension or emptiness of the bladder. In the same category of methods of exploration, the rectal and vaginal touch must be noted. By the rectal touch the pulp of the forefinger, turned toward the prostate and the bas-fond ot the bladder, can explore those parts of the urinary organs, and furnish important data for diagnosis. In women, the vaginal touch renders analogous service in permitting the finger to palpate the urethra and the bas- fond of the bladder. But it is chiefly by sounding that we succeed in acquir- ing the most precise notions in regard to the state of the organs in question. This exploratory sounding should be made in a different manner, and with special instruments, according as it is proposed to explore the bladder or the urethra. Exploration of the urethra, which has for its principal object to ascer- tain the degree of permeability of the canal, and to detect the presence of an Fig. 1305.

A cross-section and part of a longitudinal section of the building is shown in Fig. 1515, and will be referred to again in connection with ventilation and warming. The size of the ward is 90 feet 10 inches long, 27 feet 8 inches wide, and 16 feet average height. Fig. 1515. Pavilion of Johns Hopkins Hospital: cross-section and part of longitudinal section.

In a two-story pavilion the arrangement of the wards should be the same, with a device for the entire separation of the two wards by having an inde- pendent entrance to the upper one, by'a stairway leading from^the open connecting corridor. The place of this stairway is shown in Fig. 1514. In Germany there are a number of important hospitals built in part accord- ing to the new principles, with one-story pavilions for surgical cases, while some of the buildings have three stories. The Berlin Hospital is entirely without connecting corridors, and in other hospitals these have only roofs and open sides on the principal story, with closed basements.

•URINARY CALCULUS. 224 Coulson uses a fenestrated lithotrite; Billroth and Dittel use Reliquet’s, which is partly fenestrated. The German surgeons have modified it slightly. Guyon, who has done more operations than any one else, uses only fenestrated litliotrites, having three sizes, suitable for the various sizes of urethra and of stone. The instruments which I employ are three: Fig. 1214 shows the jaws, and Fig. 1215 the handle, of the larger and stronger instrument. The pattern of Fig. 1214. the jaws is the same in all. The three sizes are to accommodate variations in the size and hardness of the stone. I prefer the Reliquet pattern of rough- Fig. 1215. ening the male blade. The instrument is narrow, but exceedingly strong. It grasps well, and cannot clog. With any reasonable care it is unlikely to catch a fold of the bladder in its bite. For purposes of experiment I have caught up a fold of the bladder in the dead subject with Bigelow’s, Thompson’s, and my own instrument. It is not difficult to do this, and not difficult to recognize the bladder when caught, nor is it difficult to drop the bladder uninjured after the operator becomes conscious that it is caught. A few words will account for the creation of my instrument. In 1876, I received from Paris a Reliquet’s lithotrite, made by Collin. I was delighted with its grasping power, but the jaws clogged badly the first time I used the instrument, and could iiot be freed. In extracting them the point of physio- logical narrowing of the urethra, at two and a half inches from the meatus, was slightly torn, and death from pysemia followed this one sitting—of the old operation without ether—the calamity being due, in my opinion, entirely to the laceration of the urethra. I had previously scratched a urethra disagree- ably, but not mortally, while using a Thompson’s non-fenestrated lithotrite, and bringing out an angular piece which could not be dislodged from its

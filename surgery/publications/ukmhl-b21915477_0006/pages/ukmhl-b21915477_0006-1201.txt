PREPARATION OP MILITARY SURGEONS FOR FIELD DUTIES. 1141 struments are in good order and in their proper places, and that a good and sufficient supply of lint, bandages, ligatures, sponges, plaster, etc., is conveniently placed and ready for use. 3. He shall take charge of all patients that in the opinion of the pre- scribing surgeon require surgical attention, make a minute and thorough examination of each case and determine whether surgical aid is necessary; judge of the best manner of benefiting the patient, taking into consideration the relation of important organs, vessels, and nerves, in proximity to the wound, what bearing they may have in the preservation or loss of the patient’s life, and to use every preservative means within the reach of surgical science to save the life of the patient with as little impairment of all his functions as possible. Duties of the Regimental Surgeon—The first duty of the day is that of the morning “sick-call,” when the sick and disabled, as well as those who are neither sick nor dis- abled, present themselves for treatment. The surgeon is called upon to exercise his judg- ment in determining the character and gravity of their ailments. If he had none to deal with but those who were really sick, his task would be plain, simple, and easy; but, unfortunately, many of the cases are feigned, and he is required to discover and over- come the means brought into requisition by a skulker’s ingenuity to carry out his decep- tion. Presuming that the surgeon is fortified by skill and experience sufficient to detect these, and has a just sense of responsibility to the United States Government (for he really regulates the strength of the command), his examinations will be made without partiality, and regardless of position or prejudice, and in his report he will assign to duty those who are tit for duty, the sick to quarters for treatment, or send them to hospital, and recommend the permanently disabled for discharge or the Veteran Reserve Corps. It may be added that in cases having slight symptoms of diseased fiction, insufficient to indicate positive and unmistakable disease, humanity would dictate, and authority sanctions, that they be placed off duty, and that they may have the benefit of the doubt, and time for development of disease. Having concluded his work thus far, the surgeon will see that a copy of his report is forwarded to the adjutant, who deducts all excused from duty from the mean strength present in the regiment, and the available strength of the command is obtained, which forms the basis for all details and assignments that may he made in the regiment. Should the regiment be tilled up by conscripts, substitutes, or enlisted men, the surgeon is required to examine each one carefully and report on his fitness for service, rejecting all those who, by reason of infirmity, are unfit, and recommending for reception such as be thinks will be able to discharge the duties of a soldier. That the duties imposed upon the surgeon are important, is obvious to any one, and should be particularly so to an officer who has recorded his obligation to subserve the interest of the United States. If the surgeon indulges the men and reports them off duty, when they are not sick, he imposes additional labor on the faithful men, who bear the heat and burden of the day, and virtually offers a reward to the faithless ; or if in examining recruits he admits any who are physically disqualified, he acts in bad faith to all, and in the end unwarrantably weakens the command, defrauds the government, and may be the cause of rendering an important engagement abortive. If he conducts his examinations carelessly, the men will soon avail themselves of the chance to escape duty, and in great numbers report themselves sick; the surgeon loses his influence for good, and he sinks into disrepute and merited disgrace, which do not terminate with his service in the army, but will follow him throughout all time. After “sick-call,” the surgeon should visit the sick in quarters, prescribe for them, and see that suitable food is provided and their quarters made as comfortable as possible ; should inspect the camp daily, see that it is well drained by proper ditching through which all superfluous or surface water may be carried off', that all filth or anything likely to produce disease is removed or corrected, that the quarters of the men are swept and aired, and their bed- ding exposed to the sun whenever practicable, that the sinks are covered with dirt, that the food of the men is of good quality and sufficient quantity (reporting any error in either), and that the cooking is judiciously done. These duties are essential and should receive daily attention, as the neglect thereof will decidedly increase the sickness of the regiment and consequently impair its efficiency. Should a soldier die in camp, or in regi- mental hospital, the surgeon should notify his commanding officer and forward to him an inventory of the soldier’s effects, with a record of the disease from which he died and the

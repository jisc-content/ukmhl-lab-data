OSTEOMALACIA AND FRAGILITAS OSSIUM. 943 It is probable that the lesions of rachitis are analogous in knock-knee and in the other forms of rachitis of adolescents; and that among the diseases of the hones and joints of young persons, local rachitis, caused by inflammation at a distance, is more frequent than is generally believed. The subject re- quires further investigation. This specimen may also be regarded as an example of rachitis combined with osteomalacia; for the cortical layer of the diaphysis was reduced to a thin flexible layer which was easily cut with the knife.1 Morbid Conditions in which Bone loses its Normal Consistence and Resistance ; Osteomalacia and Fragilitas Ossium. Besides rachitis, the bones may lose their normal consistence and power of resistance: (1) By true osteomalacia, general and progressive, to a certain extent malignant, usually puerperal; (2) By true osteomalacia, progressive also, but more slowly invading, to a certain degree benign (osteitis deformans of Paget); (3) By osteomalacia, dependent not upon any special constitutional cause, but upon an inflammatory cause which is wholly local (osteitis, necrosis with osseous new formations) ; (4) By atrophy of the bones (senile osteo- porosis, fatty osteoporosis, etc.); and (5) By idiopathic fragility of the bones. I shall describe these different morbid states in the order of the classifica- tion which I have just given. Osteomalacia (datiov, bone, paxa*<k, soft) is a morbid process of softening of bone already formed, characterized histologically by “ a lesion of nutri- tion of the bones which ends in absorption of the calcareous salts of the bone- substance and in melting away of the bony trabecuhie” (Ranvier); and clini- cally, by loss of the normal hardness and resistance of the bones, and by deformities of the skeleton which are more considerable as the softening is more marked. History and Bibliography.—The first observation of osteomalacia, accord- ing to Lobstein,2 was made by an Arabian physician by the name of Gschu- sius. This physician had seen a man—doubtless the augur Satili, whom J. Reiske3 calls the man without bones, and who died at about the time of the birth of Mahomet—a man who could move only his tongue, and who had himself carried upon a mat of palms, because he had no bones, except in his head, neck, and hands, and because the other parts of his skeleton, from his clavicle to his feet, bent like cloth. In 1851, M. Buisson collected4 fifty cases of osteomalacia, ancient as well as modern, which had been reported by Ilal- lerius,5 J. Fernelius,6 Gabrieli,7 Prattenius (1660), Anel, Valsalva (1700), Morand the younger,8 Pringle,9 Ludwig,10 Planck,11 J. P. Franck,12 Sandifort,13 Wilson,14 and others. In the writings of these different authors, the conception of osteomalacia as a morbid entity distinct from rachitis is far from clear.

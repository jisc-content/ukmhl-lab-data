HISTORY OF SURGERY. 1191 drawing up the skin and muscles, and he that doth so hold, should have a large strong hand, and a good fast gripe, whereby he may the better stay the bleeding, in the place and steede of a straight band or ligature, which hand indeed is also very necessarie, for by reason of the hard and close binding, it doth so benum that part, that the paine of the binding doth greatly obscure the sence and reeling of the incision ; and the foresaid hand is also a good direction for him that doth cut off the member; but yet in some bodies, it will not be amisse to admit bleeding according to discretion, specially in such bodies as are of hot complexions, and do abound in blood, and I have often seene, by the skillfulnes of the holder, there hath not been lost at a time fower ounces of blood ; for in weake bodies it is not good to loose much blood : for blood is said to be the treasure of life, and for that cause chiefly, a good holder is not to be spared. In like manner, there must be chosen another skilful man, that hath good experience in holding the leg below, for the member must not be held too high, for feareof staying or choking of the same, neither must he beare down his hand too low, for feare of breaking or frac- turing of the bones in the time it is a sawing or cutting off. And he that is the master or surgeon, which doth cut off the member, must be sure he have a sharpe sawe, also a very good catlin, and an incision knife, and then boldly, with a steddy and quicke hand, cut the flesh round about to the bones, without staying, being sure the periosteum, or panicle that covereth and compasseth the bones be also incised and cut, and likewise a certain muscle or sinew, that runneth betweene the bones of the leg which shall be done with your incision knife: All this being orderly performed, then set your sawe as neere unto the sound flesh, as well you may, and so cut asunder the bones, which done, Ambrose Pare, a man of great knowledge, and experience in Chirurgie, willeth, presently after the bones are cut asunder, that yee then draw the sides of the wound together, with fower stitches, that are deepe in the flesh, and made crosswise over the member, like unto the letter X, for saith lie, you may easily draw the portions of the skin and their divided muscles, which before the section were drawne upward, over the bones, and cover them close on every side, that they may take the less aire, and the wound sooner conglutinate, &c. I must confesse that I have cured many, and yet never so stitched them: notwithstanding, I wish all men to follow in the best way, for the good of their patient. But I say, having prepared in a readiness, this restrictive, to staie the flux of blood, I proceeded then as followeth : R Bolt Armeniaci Jiij, Sanguinis Braconis, Aloes, ana , Olibani ,5jss, Term sigillatce, Mastichis ana |jj, Lapidis Hcematitis §ss, Calcis ex Testis ovorum, Mummice, ana §j, Gypsi 3fb Farince Volatilis §iv.

Take of this Powder as much as will serve your turne, and mixe with the said Powder, Pilorum leporis, et ovorum albuminum ana quod satis est, let your Hare haires be the whitest and the softest that is taken from under the belly of the Hare, and cut so fine as possible may be, and with the said powder let all be mixed togither, and so brought to a reasonable thicknesse. And note that before yee cut off the member, let there be in like manner made for the purpose, three or fower small bolsters or but- tons, fashioned in the top or upper part like a Dove’s egge, or as a sugar lofe button, flat in the bottom to the compasse of a French crown, and round upwards as aforesaid; and these you shall make of very fine towe, according to Art, wrought* up in water and vinegar, whereupon you shall apply some part of the restrictive, being mixed as I liaye before declared. But yee shall heere further note that one Gulemew, a famous Chirur- geon in France, with other very learned and skilful men, counselleth us to drawe out the veins and arteries with an instrument called a Raven’s bill, and then they tie those vessels with a double strong ligature or thread, and so safely stay the bleeding, but for that I never practiced this order by stiching the veins and arteries, I will leave it as aforesaid, and procede with mine owne approved practise : and, therefore, I say when the holder of the member above the knee doth partly release the fast holding of his hand, by little and little, whereby you may the better perceive and see the mouths of the veins, that are incised and cut, and upon those veins you shall place the round endes of the small buttons, and upon them presently lay on a round thicke bed of towe made up in water and vinegar, so that it be fit as neere as you can guess it, to the compasse of the stumpeor member that is taken oft', and thereon spread the restrictive; and upon that againe, you shall lay another broder bed of towe made up as you have heard, so large that it may compasse over the member, and that it may be safely tied to keepe on

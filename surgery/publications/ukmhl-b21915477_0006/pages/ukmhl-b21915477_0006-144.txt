92 INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. and Reichel, the former writer tabulating 94 cases with 44 deaths, or 46.8 per cent., and the latter 121 cases with 58 deaths, or 47.9 per cent. The mortality is least in cases of false anus (37.8 per cent., Reichel; 38.4 per cent., Makins), and increases progressively to 40 per cent, in cases of injury to the bowel, 50 per cent, in cases of intestinal cancer, 52 per cent. (51.8 per cent., Reichel; 52.7 per cent., Makins) in cases of gangrene following hernia, and 75 per cent, in cases of intestinal occlusion. Even, however, in the most favorable cases—those of false anus—the operation is a much graver one than that of Dupuytren1 (use of the enterotome), 83 examples of which, collected by Heimann, gave 50 complete and 26 partial successes, and only 7 deaths (8.4 per cent.). 1 See Vol. V., page 983, supra.

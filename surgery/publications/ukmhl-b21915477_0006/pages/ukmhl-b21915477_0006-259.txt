203- SELECTION OF METHOD OF RADICAL TREATMENT. 10 Surgery in the Pennsylvania Hospital, p. 140. 1880. Much reiteration of well-known facts and figures is unprofitable, and I shall content myself with as small a display of tables as possible, reserving the practical consideration of the relative efficacy of the different methods for the section of this article which considers the choice of an operation as regards: (1) the peculiarities of the patient; (2) the peculiarities of the stone.1 Lithotomy.—The phenomenal success of Martineau,2 2 deaths in 84 cases, and that of Pouteau,3 8 in 120, are apparently the best on record for litho- tomy among the older records. It is a success to be aspired to, but rarely reached, although not quite as brilliant as it looks, since less than one-third of Martineau’s patients had reached fifty years. Only eleven were over sixty, and both the deaths occurred among these eleven. Alan P. Smith4 has recently reported still better figures, 52 consecutive cases of lithotomy without a death, 7 of the patients being between 40 and 71 years of age. Dudley, of Kentucky, is reported to have operated one hundred times con- secutively without a death ; but this evidence is not founded on personal, written notes. Cheselden,5 the father of the lateral operation, cut 213 times, averaging 1 death in 20 for all ages; a superb result, and showing only 1 death in 35 under the age of 10. The late S. D. Gross, of Philadelphia, cut, all told, 165 patients, with 14 deaths: 72 of these were children, with 2 deaths, 1 in 36; 93 adults gave 12 deaths, 1 in 7f.6 Gross,7 out of 2303 American cases of lateral lithotomy at all ages, finds 156 deaths, 1 in 14f. A collection by the same writer of 2711 European operations gives a mortality of 278, 1 in 9§. Gross’s general table8 shows 13,570 operations at all ages, and by all cutting methods, with 1549 deaths, an average of 1 in 8.76. This would necessarily be a low average, since it includes all operators and all operations without selection, and pays no attention to the patient’s age ; but it must not be for- gotten that many fatal cases fail to get recorded. It may be considered an excellent average if a general surgeon has a mortality no higher than 8 per cent, in his operations, 1 in 12J cases, without regard to age or selection.9 10 Morton’s tables, showing the mortality of lithotomy in the Pennsylvania Hospital at the hands of all operators, over a period of 122 years, give 1 death in 7 cases.19 This method of reasoning by general statistics leads to a general conclu- sion, and has no value when applied to a special case or set of cases. Here the element of age comes in most prominently. Thompson’s table, in this respect, as establishing a general average of mor- tality for the various ages, is full of value. It has never been practically con- tradicted by an array of figures from varying sources of equal weight and authenticity, and it is to-day a reasonably fair standard by which any one 1 See page 211, infra. 2 Med.-Cliirurg.

ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY. 1074 of curvature, by standing or sitting in attitudes which tilt the pelvis, struc- tural changes in the spine will occur from absorption of the articular pro- cesses, these bony projections being imperfectly formed in youth, and quite unable to resist lateral pressure constantly directed against them. Following this line of argument still further, the conclusion which must be reached is that the amount of structural change within the column will be greatest where the articular processes, from their shape and direction, otter the least resistance to the exciting cause of deformity, because in that region of the spine the obstacles to rotation of the vertebrae will be the more easily overcome; again, in that part of the column where the articular processes are best designed to give lateral support, there rotation will be the least de- veloped, in consequence of the better defence opposed to the destructive pres- sure. In truth, we find the very reverse of these conditions in practice: in the lumbar region of the spine, the vertebrae are especially protected by the shape of their articular processes against lateral pressure, yet in this situation are to be found the most extreme examples of structural change within the spine without lateral deviation of the whole column; in the dorsal region, the deflection of the bodies of the vertebrae seldom proceeds far before the displacement of the spinous processes takes place, although the resistance offered by the articulating processes to lateral pressure in this region is much less than that presented by the corresponding structures of the lumbar vertebrae. The various theories most deserving of notice, as being those upheld by authorities of the present day, upon the causation of lateral curvature of the spine, have now been discussed, but the subject has by no means been thor- oughly exhausted ; the space at my command will not admit of a full analy- sis of the many speculations that have been put forward, each as the true explanation of the development of this deformityâ€”speculations varying from the simple suggestion that the habit of wearing stays is the origin of the affection, to the more complex theories supported by diagrammatic illustra- tions and mathematical formulae. To follow the course of the development of lateral curvature from the first departure from the normal condition to an advanced state of deformity, is a method of investigation which is denied to us; such a progressive examination of the morbid changes in the spine through the various stages of this affection, could by no possibility be the work of one inquirer, unless supported by means of research which no indi- vidual is likely to be able to command. In attempting to solve the problem as to the causes on which the formation of lateral curvature depends, we can only rely on our knowledge of the physiological properties of the healthy spine, the nature of the anatomical changes which occur in the deformed column, and the clinical facts which accompany the development of these changes. With regard to the physiological properties of the spine, we are con- cerned chiefly with the functions which it fulfils as a supporting column and as the foundation of the skeleton; with its property as a protecting canal which contains the spinal cord, we are not interested. The bodies of the vertebra? and the intervertebral disks form the supporting section of the spinal column, and, as we have seen, these are the parts of the spine which are chiefly displaced in lateral curvature. The structure of the anterior portion of the spine is so designed as to enable the column to bear a con- siderable weight, and at the same time to permit of the necessary movements of the trunk; composed of alternate layers of light cancellous bone and elastic fibrous tissue, united together by various ligaments, it presents a column con- sisting of a series of curves and pyramids, and possessing the three attributes of strength, flexibility, and elasticity. The quality of flexibility is not equally distributed throughout the spine: the cervical region possesses the

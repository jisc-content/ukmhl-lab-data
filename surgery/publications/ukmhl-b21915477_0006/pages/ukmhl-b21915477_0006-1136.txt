As to the particular nature of the defective condition of the column which conduces to the development of lateral curvature, it is impossible to give a decided opinion, but in all probability the ligaments and intervertebral disks are the seats of mischief. For the sake of definition, let it be taken for granted that these struc- tures are wanting in their normal qualities; the spine would then be affected in two of its principal properties, viz., flexibility and elasticity. The flexibility of the spine is chiefly restricted by the ligaments which con- nect together the several vertebrae ; if these ligaments have lost their normal tenacity, the flexibility of the spine must be increased; again, the column derives its elasticity from the intervertebral disks, and if the tissue of these structures is degenerated the power of elasticity will be lessened. A spine thus unduly flexible and deficiently elastic, will be in just the condition to develop lateral curvature, if the subject is in the habit of standing and sit- ting in such positions as tilt the pelvis and throw the column into a state of curvature; because the weakness of the ligaments will readily permit of the bending of the column, while the intervertebral cartilages, from their want of elasticity, will be unable to recover from the unequal compression to which they are subjected ; thus day by day a gradual deflection of the column will take place, and a state of curvatui'e will become established. I am not in a position to prove absolutely the theory above offered, that degeneration of the fibrous tissues of the spinal column is the original source from which lateral curvature is developed ; the only evidence which could de- finitively establish this proposition as a pathological fact, would be the demon- stration that the ligaments and intervertebral disks in the early stages of lateral curvature, differed in certain structural respects from the same tissues in the healthy column. But the difficulty of making this demonstration is very great; in the first place, it is seldom that an observer has the oppor- tunity of making a post-mortem examination of a spine in the early stage of the deformity, and even when this chance is presented, it is with dead tissues only that he can experiment, rendering the worth of the experiments of very doubtful value; it must be taken into account, too, that the qualities of the tissues, the impairment of which has to be proved, may very well have degenerated without there being any clear indication of structural changes. There is, however, some valuable circumstantial evidence which may be advanced in favor of the above theory ; thus, at the periods of life at which lateral curvature commences, the deformities knock-knee and flat-foot are very commonly developed, and indeed these two distortions and lateral curvature may be said to comprise ninety-nine out of every hundred cases of deformity commencing between the ages of ten and twelve years. FTow knock-knee and flat-foot, in the great majority of cases, admittedly result from ligamentous weakness, arising respectively from insufficient resisting power of the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, and from weakness of the ligaments of the sole of the foot; defect of the fibrous tissues being thus the producing cause of two out of three of these deformities, we may justly conclude that the third is likely to be due to a similar defect, it further being considered that lateral curvature and flat-foot are frequently found to exist in the same subject. Moreover, that loss of elasticity and increase of flexibility in the spine give rise to lateral curvature, would, if admitted, account for the somewhat irregu- lar manner in which this deformity selects its victims ; it has been shown that subjects who would seem to possess all the qualifications necessary for the development of lateral curvature, such, for instance, as the patient whose case is illustrated in Fig. 1506, nevertheless escape the distortion; whilst strong, healthy girls, with good muscular organization, and apparently well

URINARY CALCULUS. 206 Finally, the very best operation scientifically, that now practised in France— the Petersen-Gnyon-Perier operation, done antiseptically with drainage, etc.— shows according to Villeneuve,1 in the 21 cases reported, a mortality of 30 per cent.—no better than that of the general table first constructed by Dulles, and including the figures of all operators. Guyon’s2 8 operations yielded 3 deaths, 1 in 2.66. As a final contribution to statistics, I may cite the thesis of A. Garcin,3 of Strasbourg, 1884. He collates the published operations of suprapubic cystotomy during the years 1879-1883—modern operations— referring for statistics up to 1851 to Gunther, and from 1851 to 1878 to Flury. Of the strictly modern operations, 94 were for the extraction of stone or foreign body from the bladder. Of these, 23 died, 24.40 per cent, as follows:— Age. 1-10 . .4 No. of Cases. . 22 Ratio. 1 : 4.40 Percentage of Mortality. 22.72 10-20 . . 26 1 : 26 3.84 20-30 . . 8 1 : 4 25. 30-50 . 7 1 : 7 14.28 50-70 . . 16 1 : 2.28 43.75 70-90 . . 11 1 : 2.75 36.36 This is perhaps the best general showing ever made for the operation—but it surely is not very encouraging, and a later exhibit by Tnfiier, Guyon’s mouthpiece, is a shade worse. He uses Garcin’s figures, and adds more recent ones, making 120 operations with a mortality of 27 per cent., and says that in the 22 cases, all told, since 1879, in which suture of the vesical walls has been resorted to, the suture has failed 20 times.4 Since, however, this operation is often reserved for the most severe cases, its apparently bad showing does not possess all the significance it appears to have. This becomes more evident from a glance at the comparative results of the lateral and high operations when the weight of the stone is taken into consideration, as very clearly set forth in the following excellent table prepared by Gross.5 Lateral operation.

The former is undoubtedly a recovery from the operation, the latter cannot be charged to either method.” 1 Rev. de Chirurgie., Sept., 1883, p. 665. 2 Ann. des Mai. des Org.

Times, Dec. 15, 1883, p. 207) reports the successful removal of a steel bonnet- pin with a glass head. I find in the Philosophical Transactions (Abridged, 4th ed., 1731, Obs. 83, p. 162), the record of an amusing as well as instructive case. One Dorcas Blake, in 1694, was cut by Mr. Proby above the pubis to extract an ivory bodkin, four inches long. He cut outside the rectus muscle, and, as he very candidly confesses, “ by God’s great blessing, she was per- fectly cured.” The interest in this case is increased by the fact that this “ full-bodied, sanguine maid, about 20 years old” went before the Lord Mayor, June 10, 1695, and swore that she had swallowed the bodkin ; and her doctor believed her, although her vesical symptoms had appeared within a very suspiciously short time alter the alleged swallowing. 5 Op. cit., p. 296.

HYDROCELE. 571 and displaces the testicle downwards or to one side; the fluid is clear or milky, and when tested with heat and nitric acid becomes opalescent, instead of solid from coagulation of the albumen, as in cases of ordinary hydro- cele fluid. When placed under the microscope, spermatozoa are at times Fig. 1366. Encysted hydrocele of the testicle, or spermatic hydrocele ; the tunica vaginalis laid open, and the normal testis seen below. found. This interesting fact was communicated to the profession simulta- neously by Mr. Liston and Mr. Lloyd. On tapping a hydrocele for a man seventy years of age, I drew off five ounces of fluid, which was opalescent, and on examining some of the sediment under the microscope, I found a large number of well-formed active spermatozoa. Heat and nitric acid gave the fluid a milky appearance. Some months afterwards the old man reappeared, to have his hydrocele tapped again. I did the operation with especial care, and foretold the appearance of the fluid to be removed. I was disappointed, however, as on this occasion the fluid was strawr-colored and contained no spermatozoa. It is possible that the original opening of an efferent duct into the cyst, had healed. I have tapped on four or five occasions for another hearty old man, aged seventy-one, an encysted hydrocele of the testicle. The cyst, which has generally contained six ounces of fluid, is situated just above the testicle, which is to be seen or felt below it, and is incor- porated and moves with it. The cyst fluctuates and is translucent. The fluid is milky, contains a trace of albumen, and, after having been kept on one occasion for eighteen hours, furnished many lively spermatozoa. Since the last operation, which was done without any mishap, the cyst has become rapidly swollen and painful, and inflammation with effusion has taken place, which will probably lead to a radical cure.

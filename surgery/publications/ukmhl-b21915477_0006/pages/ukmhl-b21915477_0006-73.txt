21 MORBID GROWTHS OF THE (ESOPHAGUS. covered until after death, and some of them altogether independently of any oesophageal symptoms, it is not improbable that a number of cases of oeso- phageal tumor escape recognition altogether. In the cases recorded, males have been the subjects far oftener than females. These growths are much more frequently pedunculated than sessile, and hence the earlier cases have been chiefly mentioned as polypi. In about half the cases, attempts have been made at histological discrimination, in some instances with the aid of the microscope. Fibromata predominate. Then come myomata, of which there are records of four cases ;* cystomata, three cases ;2 adenoma, one case ;3 inflammatory neoplasm4—probably a sub-epithelial granuloma—one case. Papillary excrescences, from the size of a pin’s head to that of a lentil, some- times single and sometimes multiple,5 are said to be quite frequent in elderly persons. Benign growths are almost always single, examples of multiple growth, other than the papilloma just alluded to, being quite rare.6 The size of cysts varies from that of a very minute pea to that of a hazel-nut, and exceptionally to that of an apple.7 Fibromas may reach the bulk of a sausage,8 but few of them are larger than hazel-nuts. They are usually smooth in contour, sometimes tabulated.9 Ufa number of cases in which the location was determined, in seven the growths occupied the upper portion,10, in three11 the cardiac portion, in one a point just below the level of the bifurcation of the trachea,12 in one a point 6|- inches below the glottis,13 in one the lower third,14 and in one the lower part of the middle third of the gullet..15 In two cases it is stated that the anterior wall was occupied, in two the posterior wall, in one the left side, and in one the right; so that, there seems to be little special proclivity in regard to position. Some seem to have taken origin in the epithelium, some in the mucous follicles, and some in the muscular coat. Nothing positive is known of the etiology of these growths. Excessive use of snuff is mentioned as the cause in the title given to one of the earliest cases on record,16 and addiction to the pipe and the bottle in another.17 polypis oesophagi atque de tumore ejus generis primo extirpato.

1204 DESCRIPTION OF PLATES IN VOL. VI. PLATE XXXV. (Page 555.) FIBROMA AND CARCINOMA OF TESTIS ; RETAINED TESTIS; EPITHELIOMA OF SCROTUM ; SYPHILITIC TESTIS ; DIFFUSE ORCHITIS. Fig. 5. Fibroid testis; in place of the normal structure there is seen ordinary young fibrous tissue, in parts approaching to myxomatous tissue. (Beck ^x300.) Fig. 6. Carcinoma testis; the alveoli containing the cancer cells are well seen. (Beck ^ X 155.) Fig. 7. Retained testis; the membrana propria of the tubes is much thickened, and destitute of the highly-developed epithelial cells which normally line the tubes and secrete the spermatozoa. (Beck \ x 155.) Fig. 8. Epithelioma scroti ; at («) is seen an altered hair-follicle ; (b) a mass of large epithelial cells ; (c) stroma with small cells. ( X 200.) Fig. 9. Syphilitic testicle ; the whole gland is converted into a round-celled, fibrous mass; in the centre is a bloodvessel showing an in-growth of fibrous tissue ; in the oldest portion of the tumor nothing is to be found but dense fibrous tissue, with a few round cells, the vessels having entirely disappeared. Fig. 10. Diffuse orchitis ; a band of fibrous change is seen passing across the testicle; above and below are the seminal tubes. ( X 100.) Note.—The microscopic illustrations embraced in Plates XXXIV. and XXXV. are from draw- ings by Dr. Heneage Gibbes, Lecturer on Physiology and Pathology at the Westminster Hospital, London.

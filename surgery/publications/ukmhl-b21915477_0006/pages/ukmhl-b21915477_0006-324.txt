URINARY CALCULUS. 268 down against the calculus and held firmly in place hy turning the wheel d. Finally, the central drill at the end of the inner shaft e is by a rotation of the handle made to perforate the stone, and by further force exerted upon the wheel d, fragmentation is accomplished. A straight metallic tube (Fig. 1259), half an inch in diameter, with an obtu- rator, is useful in washing the bladder, and for the same purpose a metallic tube one-sixth inch in diameter, having a rounded head of hard rubber about half an inch in diameter with numerous perforations looking backwards (Fig. 1260); a Davidson’s or other syringe with a suitable nozzle, and a piece of rubber pipe to form connections, complete the washing apparatus.

The devices for arresting hemorrhage which have received approval over and above the common application of the ligature, and the use of heat, cold, and astringents, are seven. Of the seven, three are varieties of plugging, suitable for deep venous hemorrhage. They are the rectal tampon, the shirted canula, and the air-tampon. The four appropriate for a deep arterial hemor- rhage are: (1) Horner’s awl; (2) Thompson’s tenaculum; (3) forcipressure forceps ; (4) Gross’s artery compressor. Horner’s awl (Fig. 1261), is a curved needle in a fixed handle. The thread is looped over the shoulder near the point, and the needle is passed along the Fig. 1261. inner side of the ascending ramus of the ischium from behind the pudic artery, starting near the tuberosity and coming out toward the surface, so that the thread may be caught, the awl withdrawn, and the solid fleshy mass

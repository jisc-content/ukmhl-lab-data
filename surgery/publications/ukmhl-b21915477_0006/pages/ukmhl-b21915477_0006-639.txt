Rochard gives the particulars of a case of hematocele of the tunica vaginalis which ascended through the inguinal canal into the cavity of the abdomen:— The scrotal portion of the tumor was oval, and reached downwards to the lower third of the thigh ; it communicated by a cylindrical prolongation, in the course of the ingui- nal canal, with a second swelling within the cavity of the belly; tins reached upwards to the navel, stretched to the right across the middle line, and lost itself at the bottom of the left iliac fossa. The patient, aged 51, had, six years before, had gonorrhoeal epi- didymitis ; he also had an inguinal rupture on the same side. The haematocele had begun suddenly, and was of nine months’ duration.

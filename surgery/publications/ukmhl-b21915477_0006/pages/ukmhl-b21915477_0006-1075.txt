CLUB-FOOT. 1015 far enough to the side opposite to that of puncture, and some fibres at the edge of the tendon have been left undivided ; in such cases the knife must be entered again and the section made complete, and the same must be done if the small plantaris tendon has not been severed. The operation should be a bloodless one, a result which is to be obtained by keeping the knife as close as possible to the side and under surface of the tendon. There is some slight risk of wounding the posterior tibial artery if the knife be entered on the tibial side of the leg, and pushed too far down before turning it; but this may be avoided by entering on the fibular side, and this is the safest course to pur- sue with infants or very young children; in older subjects, either side of the leg may be entered if the knife be kept within proper limits. After the opera- tion, the small wound is closed with a pad of lint and strapping, another pad of lint is placed over this, and the limb is secured to a flexible splint with the foot in the extended position. At the end of four days the dressings may be removed and the use of the Scarpa’s shoe be resumed ; by using the cog-wheel at c, flexion of the foot and lengthening of the tendon must be gradually obtained, treatment being carried on very slowly ; for if too much haste is made in these cases of paralytic equinus, the union will be weak and the new tissue will always be liable to stretch and leave the patient with the opposite condition of deformity, calcaneus. It is never desirable to restore full flexion at the ankle, but to stop when about half the normal degree of movement has been gained, this being quite sufficient for all the ordinary purposes of walking, running, etc. IVeatment by Manipulation.—The treatment of paralytic equinus in which the Achilles tendon only so far limits movement by its contraction as to pre- vent the foot from being flexed beyond the right angle, is generally better con- ducted by mechanical and physiological measures than by tenotomy; such a course of treatment should always be first adopted with young children, or in cases in which there is much wasting of the limb, it being understood, of course, that there are present no other reasons, such as will hereafter be de- scribed, for resorting to tenotomy. The mechanical treatment consists in the use of a Scarpa’s shoe in the same manner as when the tendon has been divided, only that the extension may be pushed on as quickly as can possibly be done without causing injury from the exercise of too much force. The physiological measures employed are daily flexion of the foot on the leg, which may be accomplished either by manipulation or by means of an instrument; if done by hand, an attendant holds the leg firmly, keeping the knee extended, and with the other hand flexes the foot as far as possi- ble; he then relaxes and again flexes the foot, continuing the exercise for as long a period as may be thought advisable. The patient may himself con- duct the same exercise by using an instrument constructed on the plan of Stromeyer’s exercising board; this consists of a frame to which is fixed a trough for the leg ; to the leg-piece is attached, by a free joint corres- ponding to the ankle, a contrivance to hold the foot, which is constructed very much like the foot-portion of an ordinary Scarpa’s shoe; to the end of this is jointed a steel rod about two feet long and supplied with a handle; the leg and foot being fastened to this appliance, the patient by means of the rod works the foot-piece backwards and forwards, and so extends and flexes the foot on the leg. A still better method is for the patient to place the toe of the affected foot against the wall of a room, and, whilst keep- ing the toot flat on the floor, to endeavor to flex the ankle-joint as much as possible; then relax and again flex, taking care when so doing not to raise the heel from the ground. After employing this exercise for some days, the knee will probably be made to touch the wall; the foot must then be drawn back, and the distance be gradually increased until free movement has been

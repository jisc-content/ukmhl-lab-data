848 INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES. foreign body be then removed, the process will be seen to follow a reverse course, and the normal state to be re-established little by little. The newly- formed layers of bone, sub-periosteal and intra-medullary, the latter especi- ally, are gradually reabsorbed, whilst the granulations of the space which contained the foreign body are organized first into sclerous and then into osse- ous tissue. Healthy bone-tissue, artificially or spontaneously inflamed by a traumatic cause, always tends to resume its former character, especially in young sub- jects. "When a bone is subjected to an irritation extending to its different tissues, periosteum and medulla, or limited to one of these, it is found at the end of two or three months that everything has been restored to order, and it is hard to recognize the traces of the inflammation if the bone has enlarged materially in that time. By the time that the process of physiological growth has resumed its course, the bone then formed has been by degrees covered with regularly formed layers from the periosteum, and absorption has taken place in the medullary canal so as to cause the disappearance not only of the intra- medullary ossifications due to artificial inflammation, but also, of the deep layers of the old diaphysis. In this incessant work of deposit under the periosteum and of absorption in the central canal, which characterizes the normal increase of the bone, all the osseous tissue existing at the time of the experiment disappears, and is rapidly replaced by entirely new bone.

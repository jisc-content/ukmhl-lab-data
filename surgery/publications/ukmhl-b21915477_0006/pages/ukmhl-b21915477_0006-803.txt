'elytrorraphy. 743 catheter being retained in the bladder, the metallic sound of the former strik- ing against the latter may be recognized. The old method of denuding must, however, be resorted to, if the vesico- vaginal wall is very thin and atrophied. Hegar uses the bistoury, but Simon preferred scissors; Bischoff, after having circumscribed the tissues to be removed, seizes the flap, and separates it by drawing on it with his fingers. Whatever method is used, after the flap has been removed the surface should be levelled, all islands of projecting tissue being trimmed away with scissors. If during the denuding abundant hemorrhage occurs, the haemostatic forceps or even the ligature may be used, the final haemostasis being secured by care- fully applied sutures. When only anterior colporraphy is practised, silk sutures may be used; but if posterior colporraphy also, silver wire is a better material, for the stitches must remain some time. Schroeder’s Method.’—Schroeder regards it as important that the space denuded shall not be too small. Below, it begins at the mouth of the urethra, and it extends above to the anterior lip of the uterus. He thinks it more satisfactory if the part removed be torn from its base, as there are then no islands of mucous membrane left. Or the denudation may be effected by introducing a long flat knife under the edge of the incised mucous membrane, and cutting each way; after completing this dissection, the surface is to be levelled with scissors. Then the sutures are introduced ; some of them are superficial, others deep—of the latter only three are usually required; the deep Fig. 1419. Anterior colporraphy. (Schroeder’s method.) sutures are to prevent the formation of pockets in which blood or wound-secre- tions may collect. According to Werth’s suggestion, catgut may be used for the deep stitches, and it is very convenient, for the perfect adaptation of the 1 Op. cit.

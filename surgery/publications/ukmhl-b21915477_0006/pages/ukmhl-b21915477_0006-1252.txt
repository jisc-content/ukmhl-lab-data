1192 APPENDIX. the rest; whereupon yee shall in like manner spread of the restrictive reasonable thick, afore yee place it to the rest, and yee shall cut it in fower places, one cut right over against another, an inch in length and somewhat more : and yee shall tie or fasten the said large bed to with a ligature, which they call a choke band doubled two or three times, being Hat, and fully an inch brode and a yard long: in the middle of the said ligature or band, you shall spread some of the restrictive, so that it may take the better bold unto the large bed of towe, being very fast tied, then you shall place thereon a double large bed of soft linnen cloth, and then with a strong rowler of fower inches brode, and three or fower yards long, let it be artificially rowled, and where the blood beginneth to shew, in that place speedily lay on a good compressor or thicke bolster made of tow brought up in water and vinegar, the thickness in the middle to a man’s band, and the thinner towards the edges, in compasseof a Philip’s dolor, more or lesse, as you suppose the greatness of the flux to be, and couch them close to, in as many places as the blood doth shew itselfe, and thus with two or three rowlers, and as many soft linnen beds, some single, and some double, with a sufficient number of bolsters, some great and some small, you may safely stay the flux of blood : which order and way did never fade me, nor any other that have used the same according unto the order here prescribed: also sometimes we do use to draw over the great bed of tow, being surely tied with the foresaid chokeband, a wet Oxe bladder, and so do pull it close up over the same, the which is tied fast also with a ligature or chokeband, and upon the same a double or single bed of soft linnen cloth, and thus wfith a few brode bolsters and rowlers very orderly is staied the flux of blood. All which being artificially done, then you shall as easily as possible may be, carie the patient to his bed, having a pillow made ready to rest the member on : Thus let him lie with as much quietness as you can, keeping a convenient diet; then the third or fourth day if nothing do let, you shall have in a readiness steuphs of white wine, with decent rowlers and bolsters, and other necessaries meete for the second dressing. To conclude, yee shall here observe, that if at any time you have not of my restrictive powder in a readiness, you may use either Vigoe’s order, to cauterize the place, with a bright cauterizing iron, or else with M. Gale’s powder, which is a most worthy invention, and better pleaseth the patient, than the hot glowing irons, which are very offensive unto the eie. But yet the powder wrought with extreme paine, and made a very great eschar, and by that means the bone hath been afterwards new cut againe, and so did make a very long work in some, ere ever they were cured. The powder which I have here published, is of my own invention, and it never causeth paine, but often bringeth with it a perfect white digestive matter, which powder I did keepe secret to mine own private use, and I did first put it in practice in the Hospital Saint Bartholomews, as it is well knowne at this day unto some of the Surgeons that then served with me there, who were present with me at that time, when there was taken off in one morning, seaven legs and armes, where, by the assistance and helpe of Almightie God, we staied all their fluxes of blood, without any paine unto them, but onely in the compression and close rowling, and tenderness of the wound excepted. After that time, it was given out, and made knowne to divers Surgeons, that were very desirous to have it. The “gentle reader” will excuse me for having made so lengthy a quota- tion from the “ hooke” of Master Clowes. It is historically extremely in- teresting, as it was written at the period of transition from the barbarous use of the actual cautery as a means of arresting traumatic hemorrhage, to the employment of the ligature for this purpose. Here we learn the com- position and use of “ restrictive powders,” of the custom of keeping their methods and inventions profoundly secret, of the complex dressings of stumps, of the caution and tardiness with which new modes of practice were adopted, as shown by Clowes’s rejection of the ligature, and of the covering of the stump with the integument, which was the forerunner of the flap opera- tion. We also learn from this work of three centuries ago, how remarkably well the old English surgeons succeeded in “ staing all the fluxes of blood” in their cases of amputation, and also observe with admiration how antisep- tic, air-excluding, almost Listerian, these somewhat clumsy dressings were.

428 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. urethra, the rectal touch will come to our aid. The finger inserted in the rectum supports the catheter, keeps its beak applied against the upper wall, and so permits it to pass over the obstacle. Fig. 1315. Evacuatory catheterization: first stage. Evacuatory Catheterization with Flexible Catheters.â€”Catheterization with flexible catheters is practised in two totally different ways: sometimes the catheter is used by itself, sometimes there is introduced into it a more or less flexible metallic rod, called a stylet (Fig. 1317), which is designed to give the catheter the qualities of an inflexible instrument. The flexibility of the stylet makes it possible also to bend it at will, and thus to imitate all the varieties of metallic catheter. A stylet should become as it were one piece with the catheter. To secure this fundamental condition, Yoillemier recommends the use of stylets the heels of which are conical for a distance of three or four centimetres, and which enter the catheter with some friction. The various manoeuvres of catheterization with flexible catheters armed with stylets, do not differ from those which I have already described for evacuatory catheterization with curved metallic catheters. I need not go over this again, but I ought to point out a special manoeuvre which makes it possible to employ a stylet with an elbow, and which may be of service in cases of prostatic obstruction. This manoeuvre consists in drawing the stylet

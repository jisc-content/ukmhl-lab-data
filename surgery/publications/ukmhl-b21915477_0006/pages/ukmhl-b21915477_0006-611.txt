AFFECTIONS OF THE SCROTUM. 553 Cartilaginous and bony tumors of the scrotum are rare. Dr. Kerr1 excised a dense, hard, slowly growing scrotal tumor, weighing five pounds and con- sisting of numerous cartilaginous lobes, in which large quantities of bone were deposited. The microscope proved one compact plate to be of genuine bone. Fig. 1359.

Cystic Tumor of the Scrotum.—Mr. Curling2 narrates an interesting case of cystic tumor of the scrotum, and gives illustrations of the case both before and after removal:— The patient, when about 8 years old, had two or three small cysts in the scrotum, which were of the size of a horse-bean and situated beneath the integuments. The cysts increased in size and number, in spite ot the use of mercurial and iodine oint- ments, tapping, and graduated pressure. The testicles were healthy, and below them and behind a portion of the scrotum which was inflamed and painful, a number of cysts could be felt. The whole of the diseased mass was successfully removed when the patient was twenty-two years old; the cysts were of various sizes and contained a transparent fluid. The specimen resembled a cystic sarcoma of the breast. Dr. Bauchet3 removed from the scrotum of a man aged thirty, a cyst which had slowly grown to the size of a small hen’s egg. The cyst, which was quite distinct from the testicle, was transparent, being filled with a viscid yellow fluid, and on removal was seen to have originated in an obstructed sebaceous follicle. Dr. Fleming4 removed from a boy’s scrotum, by means of a ligature, a cyst which had followed a contusion. 1 North Amer. Med.-Chir. Rev., Jan. 1858. 2 Diseases of the Testis, p. 623.

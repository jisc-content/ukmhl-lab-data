INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. 134 Fig. 1195. Fig. 1196. Forceps for grasping hemorrhoids. but the hemorrhage proceeds from parts wounded in the application of the crusher. In these cases I always adopt ligation as being the best and safest procedure. The method of operating is as follows: The patient must lie on his right side,, on a hard couch, with his knees drawn well up to his abdomen. When he is fully anaesthetized, I gently but completely dilate the sphincter muscles. I then seize the hemorrhoids one by one with a volsella, and with a pair of strong, sharp, spring-scissors (Fig. 1197) separate the pile from its connection Fig. 1197. with the muscular and submucous tissues upon which it rests ; the cut is to be made in the sulcus or white line which is seen where the skin meets the mucous membrane, and this incision is to be carried up the bowel, and parallel to it, to such a distance that the pile is left connected by an isthmus of vessels and mucous membrane only. There is no danger in making this incision, because all the larger vessels come from above, running parallel with the bowel, just beneath the mucous membrane, and thus enter the upper part of the pile. A well-waxed, strong, thin, silk ligature is now to be placed at the bottom of the deep groove which has been made, and, an assistant then drawing out the pile with some decision, the ligature is tied high up at the neck of the tumor as tightly as possible. Great care must be taken to tie both knots of the liga- ture, so that no slipping or giving way can take place. I myself always tie a third knot; the secret of the well-doing of the patient depends greatly upon this tyingâ€”a part of the operation by no means easy.

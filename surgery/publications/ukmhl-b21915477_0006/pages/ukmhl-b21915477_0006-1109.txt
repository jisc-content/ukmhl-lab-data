1049 GENU VALGUM. have left a permanent condition of weakened health are liable to acquire the deformity. At a later period of life, youths of both sexes, who are employed in occupations which compel them to stand or walk during the greater part of the day, very commonly become knock-kneed, from sheer inability of their joints to withstand the strain to which they are subjected. Many of these cases should rather be classed as of mechanical origin, for although a defective state of health is generally produced by such a mode of life, yet it is not uncommon to meet with youths who have acquired genu valgum and yet remain in other respects robust and strong. The development of knock- knee from muscular contraction is usually associated with some other deform- ity of the joint arising from the same cause, and can be more conveniently considered in another part of this article. Treatment of Genu Valgum..—Genu valgum may be regarded as the sim- plest of all the deformities of the body which are presented to us for treat- ment ; the distortion does, however, in a few cases assume an intractable character, owing to advanced changes within the joint; these exceptional instances require separate notice, and it will be convenient before discussing them to proceed with the consideration of the treatment of the usual con- ditions of distortion such as have been described above. Ivnock-knee is peculiarly amenable to treatment for two reasons: first, the defect in the condition of the joint is remarkable for the simplicity of its nature, and we have not here, as in the case of distortion of the foot, to deal with the serious derangement of a complex piece of mechanism, the separate parts of which require to be restored to place in order to reduce the deformity; secondly, the position of the joint is very favorable for the application of remedial measures, since the thigh and leg form long levers which can readily be utilized for the employment of well-regulated mechanical pressure. In the early stage of knock-knee, treatment must be directed to restoring the ligaments to a healthy condition, and to preventing those structures from becoming stretched before they have acquired their normal tenacity. Atten- tion to the general health is the matter of first importance, whilst for local treatment the joint should be douched daily with cold water, and afterwards well rubbed and shampooed, especially on its inner surface. If the child is able to walk fairly well, he should be encouraged to use his limbs, and not, as is frequently advised, be kept entirely at rest; if necessary, a light knee- cap, stiffened with steel springs, may be worn to support the weakened joint as long as a tendency to deformity continues to exist. If displacement of the leg is more advanced—to such a degree, for instance, that the ankles are separated three inches from one another when the limbs are extended and placed together—mechanical treatment may be added to the above, by apply- ing splints to the legs during the night, and for a few hours during the day. The splints should be shaped and padded like those already described for the treatment of curvature of the leg-bones, and must be sufficiently long to reach from an inch above the great trochanter to the sole of the foot; they are placed on the outside of the limb, and are firmly fixed with a bandage. In a still more severe grade of deformity the straight splint is not a convenient appliance to use, because it is liable to slip around to the front of the leg and thus lose its purchase ; it is for such cases advisable to divide the splint opposite the knee-joint, and to connect the thigh and leg pieces with a cog- wheel which gives lateral movement; a broad knee-cap, extending well above and below the knee, may also be attached to the splint, and will be found of great assistance in keeping the limb in place. In these more advanced cases of the deformity, the structural shortening of the external lateral ligament is the chief obstacle to be overcome in straightening the leg; in order to hasten the reduction of the deformity it

13 FOREIGN BODIES IN THE (ESOPHAGUS. In a compilation of thirty-three instances of slow perforation of blood- vessels by ulceration,1 it was found that the aorta had been pierced in seven- teen, the left carotid in three, the vena cava in two, and the right carotid, the inferior thyroid (Fig. 1164), an abnormal right subclavian, the pulmonary and the oesophageal arteries each in one, undetermined arteries in four, and the right coronary and demi-azygos veins each in one instance. Primary perforation of the bloodvessels is rare;2 the only two cases collected by the author of the compilation alluded to involved the aorta, and were caused re- spectively by a pointed bone and a needle,3 and in both of them death by hemorrhage occurred shortly after the receipt of the injury Fig. 1163.

Among other causes of death noted from retained foreign bodies in the oesophagus, may be mentioned eclampsia ;4 purulent oesophagitis,5 even from so simple an object as a bead ;6 caries of the vertebrae7 secondary to cesopha- 1 Poulet, op. cit. 2 Collins, Dublin Quart.

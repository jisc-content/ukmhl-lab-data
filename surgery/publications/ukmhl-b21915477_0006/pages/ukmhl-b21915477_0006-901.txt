OPERATIONS FOR OVARIAN AND UTERINE TUMORS. 841 It need only be added that, after this operation, the clamp is found in this country and in England to be as uniformly useful as it is harmful in ovario- tomy ; while no proportionate amount of success has attended any intra- peritoneal method of treating the pedicle. In Germany, however, Prof. Schroeder has succeeded well with ligation of the pedicle, covering it in with the peritoneum. Prof. Hegar, of Ereiburg, whose success in hysterectomy for myomata has only been surpassed or equalled by Keith, treats the pedicle by a special method. He surrounds its base, as low down as possible, with Kleeburg’s elastic ligature, which is tied while on the stretch. Above this a double ligature is passed through the stump, tied firmly in two sections, and all above that cut away. How, drawing up the stump into the lower angle of the abdominal wound, the pai’ietal peritoneum is stitched securely to the peritoneal covering of the pedicle, just below the elastic ligature. The first suture above the stump is passed through the parietal peritoneum, then under the elastic ligature and through the peritoneum on the opposite side; and when this is tightened it closes in the stump with peritoneum com- pletely. Two more sutures are passed just above this through the perito- neum only, and the rest of the wound is closed as usual. The face of the stump is now cauterized ; the raw surface around it is painted freely with a strong solution of chloride of zinc, and packed lightly with aseptic cotton, which is frequently changed as it becomes saturated with discharge; and the whole is covered lightly with the usual antiseptic dressing, constant watch- fulness preventing the collection or burrowing of pus. About the tenth day the elastic ligature is carefully cut away, and good union is obtained in a fortnight.

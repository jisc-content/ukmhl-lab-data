964 SCROFULO-TUBERCULOUS AND OTHER STRUCTURAL DISEASES OF BONES. cases of Paget, there were three in which cancer showed itself toward the end of life. Is this a simple coincidence? At any rate, Paget himself recog- nizes that this point demands examination. There are in the museums, at Guy’s Hospital especially, specimens of symmetrical osteoid cancer of the iliac hones, with cancer of the vertebral column and of the cranium— specimens in which the walls of the latter show hypertrophy comparable to that of osteitis deformans. In the first case of Sir James Paget, there were cancerous nodules in the walls of the cranium. The bones of this first typical patient (see Figures 1459, 1460, and 1461), were examined microscopically by Mr. Butlin. There Avas a peculiar inflammation, affecting, in the cranium, the whole thickness of the hone; in the long bones, chiefly the compact layer of the walls of the diaphysis, as well as that of their articular surfaces. It is probable that these changes were inflammatory from the beginning, because the softening was accompanied by thickening (see Fig. 1461), by proliferations Fig. 1459. Fig. 1460. Fig. 1461.

Mr. Butlin asks, Does the inflammation persist to the end ; or, after having lasted a number of years, does it give place to the reparative processes of consecutive eburnation ? It is not known. But it is known that the inflammatory nature of the disease is incontestable. The Haversian canals (see Fig. 1462) are enlarged by

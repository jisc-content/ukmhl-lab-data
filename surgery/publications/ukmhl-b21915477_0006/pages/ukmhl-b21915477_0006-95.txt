43 GASTROSTOMY AND ENTEROSTOMY. tration of Whitehead's well-nourished, tracheotomized, gastrostomic patient. (Fig. 1184.) Enterostomy.—When gastrostomy is found to he impracticable on account of participation of the stomach in the carcinomatous disease, it has been pro- posed to make the fistula in the duodenum—duod.enostomy or enterostomy. Suggested by Surmay, the first operation of this character was performed by Langenbuch, who had intended to resect a carcinomatous pylorus; but on finding the disease too extensive, he stitched the duodenum to the abdominal wound, and eight days afterward formed the fistula. The patient died three days subsequently. Other cases in the hands of Surmay, Robertson, and Southam also terminated fatally. The operation of gastro-enterostomy has been described elsewhere.1 1 See Vol. V., page 1111, supra.

SCROFULO-TUBERCULOUS AFFECTIONS OF BONES. 913 Kiener has represented a section from the periphery of a patch of tuberculous infiltration. Fig. 1448 represents a section of diffused tuberculous infiltra- tion, designated by MM. Kiener and Poulet under the name of acute tuber- culous osteitis. Fig. 1448. Diffuse infiltration, acnte tuberculous osteitis of MM. Kiener and Poulet. 1, tuberculous follicles ; 2, giant-cells scattered through the proliferated cellular tissue; 3, cavities caused by caseous breaking-down of the follicles; 4, rarefied bone-tissue. The sequestrum does not always show hypertrophy; in some cases its trabeculae are thinned. M. Kiener has studied the histological conditions of condensation and rarefaction. In his opinion the proliferation of bone is preluded by the appearance of osteoblasts upon the trabeculre, as in normal growth. Around these osteoblasts there is deposited bone-material, some- times in continuous layers, sometimes in small protuberances. At still other times, the bone-material is deposited between the fibres of the connective tissue furnished by medullary proliferation. Rarefaction is brought about in two ways; sometimes, as in the formation of a lacuna of Howship, the edges of the trabeculie are furrowed by small fossie with regular outlines. The work of wearing away is caused by the giant-cells—by osteoclasts, accord- ing to the expression of Kolliker—which owe their origin to a functional and anatomical transformation of the osteoblasts, according to M. Julius Busch (osteoblasty). Sometimes the rarefaction results from solution of the calcareous cement and return of the bone-substance to the fibrous state. It is well known that Charles Robin attributed the density of the sequestrum, not vol. vi.—58

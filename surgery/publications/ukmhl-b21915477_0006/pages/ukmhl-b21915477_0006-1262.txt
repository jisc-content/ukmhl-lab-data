1202 APPENDIX. epitome of medical history by Dr. Dunglison, are about all that we have to offer on this subject. To these we can add Renouard’s History of Medicine, which has been translated from the French and republished in this country. Great Britain has produced brief histories by Freind, Aikin, Lettsom, Walker, Black, Hamilton, Bostock, Moir, Wise, Davis, Meryon, and a few others. There have only been translated from the French and published in England the histories of Le Clerc and Cabanis. In the German tongue there are many works on the history of medicine and surgery. The student will want to read the treatises of Schulze, Sprengel, Ilecker, Cboulant, and Morwitz, In French many excellent historical works will be found relating to our pro- fession. Besides all of these the student will derive much satisfaction and extensive information from the numerous bibliographies of medicine and surgery. Haller’s bibliotheca? of anatomy and of surgery, each in two quartos ; Floy’s Dictionnaire Historique de la Medecine Ancienne et Mod,erne, 4 vols. 4to; Dezeimeris’s work with the same title, 4 vols. 8vo ; and Jourdan’s Biograjdiie Medicale, 7 vols. 8vo ; are among the most valuable of this character. We are sadly in need of a comprehensive history of anatomy, medicine, and surgery, in the English language.

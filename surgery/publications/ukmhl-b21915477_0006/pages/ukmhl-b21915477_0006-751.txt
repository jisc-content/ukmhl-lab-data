TEARS OF THE PERINEUM. 691 1 Billroth, Handbucli der Frauenkrankheiten. In complete rent of the perineum, the operation may be by flaps, the perineo- synthesis of Langenbeck, by other methods which imitate it, or by trian- gular denudation. The former can only be employed when the tissue is abun- dant and rich in vessels, and then there is often difficulty in haemostasis, success is less constant, and the mortality is greater; for these reasons it is rejected by Hegar and Kaltenbach. The preparation of the patient, her position, and the duties of the assistants who support her lower limbs, are the same as in the operation for incomplete perineal tear. The accompanying illustration (Fig. 1389) from Hildebrandt1 gives the form of denudation recommended by him. Hildebrandt suggests—in addition to the means already mentioned for the arrest of bleeding, which is rarely troublesome, especially in cases where the rent has existed for some time—digital compression by the thumb in the vagina and the Anger in the rectum. In the three sets of sutures advised—vaginal, rectal, and external—he regards it as important that only one set should be deep, the others superficial. He passes all the sutures before fastening any, but Hegar and Kaltenbach advise, after the introduction of the deep- est suture, to fasten it so as to see the re- sult obtained, and then to introduce and fasten the second suture in like manner, correcting, if necessary, the form of the freshened surface, and securing more accu- Fig. 1390.

EXPLORATION OF THE URETHRA AND BLADDER. 429 back, at the same time that the catheter is pushed on, so that the beak of the latter rises up and undergoes a change of direction which allows it to pass over the obstacle. Guy on recommends for this manoeuvre the employment Fig. 1316. Evacuatorv catheterization : third stage. of a double-elbowed catheter, the movement of which, when it is liberated by the withdrawal of the stylet, furnishes the conditions which are needed for overcoming prostatic obstruction much better than the ordinary elbowed catheter. Fig. 1317. Catheterization with a flexible catheter, not armed with a stylet, does not merit special description. The flexibility of the instrument causes it to accommodate itself to the various curves of the canal, and it suffices to push it on gently, to make it traverse the whole length of the urethra. Mean- while, an exact knowledge of the normal anatomy of the part, and the dexterity which practice alone can give, enable one to stop before an obstacle, to pass round it, or to avoid it by directing the catheter in one direction or another. To complete what refers to the general rules for catheterization, I shall say a few words about catheterization in the female, and about the manner of fixing catheters which are to be retained. Catheterization in the Female.â€”For this catheterization, which is generally very easy on account of the shortness and the almost rectilinear direction of the canal, either metallic catheters, very slightly curved, or ordinary flexible

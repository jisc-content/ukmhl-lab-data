694 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITALS. wounded surfaces, makes a subcutaneous section of the anal sphincter poste- riorly, and, after the operation, fastens the patientâ€™s lower limbs together, and confines her to bed for three weeks ; the catgut is absorbed within nine days. Yeit irrigates the wounded surfaces with one-to-ten-tliousand corro- sive-sublimate solution; he also uses catgut. In concluding the consideration of the treatment of ruptures of the peri- neum, I desire to mention a step which I have found useful at the beginning of a perineoplasty when the tear has been complete. The surgeon takes a needle threaded with catgut, and, entering it externally a little behind the anal rent, passes it upward about half an inch, so that it includes a part of the rectum close to the tear on that side; then turning it directly across, he makes, it similarly embrace corresponding tissues upon the other side, emerging through the skin. The method is shown in the subjoined illustration. By Fig. 1398. Perineoplasty ; catgut suture approximating walls of vagina. firmly pulling the two ends of the catgut, the complete tear is temporarily made incomplete, and the surfaces to be denuded are better exposed and ren- dered more fixed. After the denudation the suture may be. withdrawn; or it may be tied, and made to assist in keeping the parts which are to unite in apposition.

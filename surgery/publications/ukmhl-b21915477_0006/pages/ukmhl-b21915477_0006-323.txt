LITHOTOMY. 267 man, and the prostate so long, that the finger cannot enter the neck of the bladder. The straight side of this gorget is entered along the statf, and upon it as a guide the forceps pass into the bladder. Fig. 1255. Crested scoop. Fig. 1256. Blunt gorget. Forceps to crush large stones have been devised in great variety. One such instrument in common use has solid jaws, with a ridge of central teeth projecting backward in either jaw (Fig. 1257), and an adjustable hook and Fig. 1257. screw which are attached to the handles after the stone is caught, and which allow the screw-power to be brought to bear upon the stone. This forceps resembles Dolbeau’s lithoclast. A number of other ingenious lithoclasts are used, most of which will readily break a phosphatic stone as large as they can grasp, but fail with an oxalate-of-lime stone. Maisonneuve’s instrument, the eclateur (Fig. 1258), for the fragmentation of very solid stone through a perineaL Fig. 1258. wound, is exceptionally powerful, but is clumsy and difficult of application. I have used it a number of times upon the dead body, but not upon the living. It is capable of fragmenting the hardest of urinary concretions. The curve of the female blade is insinuated carefully through the perineal wound, and by a lateral movement made to pass around and beneath the lame stone. Then the male blade or perforator, c b, with the inner drill e e withdrawn, is pushed

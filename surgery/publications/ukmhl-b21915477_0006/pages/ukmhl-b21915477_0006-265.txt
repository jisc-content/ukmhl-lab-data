209 SELECTION OF METHOD OF RADICAL TREATMENT. there was an autopsy, showing that a damaged kidney wms the cause in two instances. In the other no cause was evident. In the fourth case, pyelitis was undoubtedly the cause of death, though there was no autopsy. In the fifth the cause was not clear. One patient died a month after the operation, and, as Bigelow remarks, the fact is simply that his operation did not save him from impending death by renal disease. The two largest stones thus dealt with have been one of 1802 grains—removed success- fully in three sittings, and one of 1380 grains, in one sitting of one hour and fifty-five minutes, also a success. Thompson’s figures, when recorded for his first hundred and odd cases, showed a mortality of about three per cent. In response to a letter asking for statistics in the spring of 1884, he kindly sent me a digest of his sixth lecture delivered before the Royal College of Surgeons, in June, 1884. In it he deals with the whole sub- ject collectively, giving his statistics from 1860 to 1884. At that time he had performed litholapaxy 191 times, but he does not mention the exact mortality. His general showing is admirable for all operations, 807 operations on 715 individuals. Of these 13 were females, with 1 death ; 15 were children, with 1 death ; 775 were adult males. Of the latter, 110 were cut, with 39 deaths—1 in almost 3—about 35 per cent.; 665 were operated on by lithotrity, the old and the new operation included, with 43 deaths—1 in 15.5, or under 6tt per cent. Of this total, 775 adult male cases, the death-rate, all told, was 1 in 9.5—and 591 of the patients were upwards of 50 years old. He states further that, in his entire experience, he has refused operation to 6 patients only. This is certainly a remarkable record. Of his last 116 lithotrity operations (litholapaxy), bended fatally— 1 in 29 cases, or less than 3^ per cent. G. Buckston Browne reports to me by letter, that, up to May 8, 1884, he had ope- rated by the new method 48 times with 2 deaths, both in old men, who died ursemic, probably with surgical kidney. Caswell, of Providence, has a small, but perfect record of successful operations for small stones upon ten individuals consecutively, and Cliis- more, of San Francisco, makes me a similar report orally, having operated upon eleven cases without a death. Dittel1 adds 50 new cases in 1884, to a former report of 30 cases, the whole yielding him 5 deaths—1 in 16—about a mortality of 6 per cent. Dr. L. A. Stimson, of this city, reports to me a list of eleven successive and successful cases. My own statistics2 are briefly these : Total number of operations 52, with 3 deaths. My first 17 consecutive cases were successful; the 18th patient died, after a second sit- ting, from advanced pyelitis. He had been bed-ridden a year—and, as in Professor Bigelow’s case, the operation failed to save him from the natural result of advanced de- generative disease of the kidney. My second death was also due to renal complications— suppression, high fever, uraemia. There was no autopsy. The kidneys were known to be diseased before the operation. The third death can hardly be charged to the operation. The subject was an old hospital patient, a man of 80 years, bed-ridden, with large pros- tate, chronic cystitis, and damaged kidneys. A small phosphatic accumulation (about half a drachm) was discovered, and removed in less than fifteen minutes. The patient’s symptoms became aggravated and he died in a week. My general impression is that the operation is reasonably (but not entirely) safe, even where the kidneys are unsound, and that with perfectly healthy kidneys litholapaxy properly performed is nearly as harmless an operation as passing a catheter. My collection contains one oxalate-of-lime stone, weighing an ounce, and removed in 32 minutes; a phosphatic stone weighing 765 grains, and removed in 45 minutes; an acid stone weighing 1065 grains removed in one hour and fifteen minutes ; each of these at one sitting, and all successfully. Guyon’s statistics are recorded in the thesis of E. Desnos. They comprise 226 cases with 12 deaths. Still more recently, Kirmisson,3 another of Guyon’s pupils, has brought the record up to 1883, adding Guyon’s last 70 cases, with 2 deaths. This clearly puts the number of Guyon’s operations at the top of the list. He has operated 296 times with 14 deaths, 1 in 21.13, or less than 5 per cent, of mortality, a most ' Wien. med. Woclienschrift, Nos. 3-11, 1884. 2 In some of my earlier cases Dr. Van Buren did a part of the crushing. He approved the operation heartily, but his failing health prevented him from operating often, and. the active work in most of the cases fell naturally to me. 3 Des Modifications modernes de la Lithotrite, p. 67.

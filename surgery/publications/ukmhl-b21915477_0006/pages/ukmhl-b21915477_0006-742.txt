The denudation may be effected with knife or scissors, most operators preferring the latter as enabling the operation to be done with greater rapidity and with less hemorrhage; it should be sym- metrical as to each lip, and it should leave in the median line of each an Fig. 1379.

Sometimes, when the lips are not much thickened and present a flat surface, it is necessary to take off a thin layer; but when they are hypertrophied and have a rounded, bulging surface, the entire convexity should be cut away” (Jackson).1 In some eases, where the tissues are dense at the angles of the rent, a knife will be necessary for denu- dation. Skene2 uses hawk-bill scissors (Fig. 1380), by which he finds that Fig. 1380. denudation at the angles, as well as elsewhere, can be accomplished accurately and with facility. The sutures, varying of course in number with the depth of the tear, usually from two to four on each side, are generally of silver wire. Skene, however, prefers braided silk (No. 7),.“prepared by being immersed for seve- ral hours in melted beeswax mixed with five per cent, each of carbolic acid and salicylic acid. When thoroughly saturated, the silk is passed through a hole in a piece of cardboard, or the eye of a needle, to remove the excess of wax.” 1 American Practitioner, 1880. 2 Holmes’s System of Surgery.

URINARY CALCULUS. 240 the funnel. The extra stopcock helow is for use upon the evacuating tube before coupling, that air may not enter it. Sir Henry Thompson’s evacuator has also passed through four distinct stages. I represent them in the annexed figures, but only describe the latest. Fig. 1236. Thompson’s fourth and latest evacuator. It is a rubber bulb, the central axis of suction of which is nearly in the line of the axis of the evacuating tube, but not as much so as in the case of Bigelow’s instrument. The glass reservoir is situated in front of the rubber bulb, and a swinging, perforated valve hangs over the orifice of the tube, to- pi-event the return of fragments into the bladder. Fig. 1237. Reservoir of Thompson’s evacuator. Other evacuators, such as those of Hill, and of Corradi of Florence, I da not think it necessary to reproduce. Otis’s evacuator involves a new mechan- ism, and as it is the first of its pattern it should be allowed opportunity for modification before it is judged, because each of its chief rivals has received several modifications before being given to the world as perfect. The figure sufficiently describes it. The sphere through which the tubes show is of glass, as is also the receiving bottle. The tubes, stopcock, and couplings are of metal, the power a rubber ball. It works without valves and delivers effectively. It is filled through a tube and stopcock at the tail of the rubber bulb, and may be worked with this bulb full either of air or of water. My objection to this instrument is that, it is impossible to get the air all out of the glass sphere by any method of filling, so that although no air is thrown

In barracks and temporary hospitals, effective use is made of large cylinder- stoves with jackets of sheet-iron or zinc, the space within which is connected with the outer air by an opening in the floor and an inlet-flue, the air being warmed as it passes by the stove before entering the room. A simpler device is to place such a stove, with a movable jacket provided with an open side, before a window which may be opened more or less. Figs. 1523 and 1524 are F.ig. 1523. Fig. 1524. Stoves for hospitals. illustrations of arrangements suggested by Dr. D. F. Lincoln .n a paper on “ School Hygiene,” in the report of the H. Y. State Board of Health for 1881-2. The entrance of fresh air by these means is promoted by a complementary de- vice for ventilation; the stove-funnel being carried to a large flue or chimney, is made to warm the air therein and create an upward current, through an exit- opening near the floor or higher, in the especially constructed flue, or through an unused fireplace. These arrangements do very well for small rooms, but in a large room occupied by many persons it is difficult to introduce fresh air and distribute it satisfactorily, by any form of stove placed in the room itself. As a rule, it is always best to place the stoves, which thus become furnaces, in the basements. This is a more effective means for giving an ample air-supply, but the use of furnaces is attended by special dangers and inconveniences. In permanent hospitals, the safest, cleanest, and best means of heating is by indirect radiation from coils of steam or hot-water pipes, placed at many points near the basement-ceilings, in encased chambers, receiving fresh air directly through the outer wall. Steam-heating apparatus is commonly used in this country: it costs less at the outset; workmen are more accustomed to the making of boilers and

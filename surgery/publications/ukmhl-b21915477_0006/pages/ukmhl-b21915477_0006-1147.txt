1087 CONGENITAL DISLOCATIONS. children, parents unusually intelligent and persevering in carrying out in- structions, and a surgeon who, with large experience in orthopaedics and great ingenuity in the adaptation of apparatus, was both able and willing to give the case unremitting personal attention. In most cases, if the malformation affects only one side, it will be sufficient to direct the wearing of a liigh-soled shoe, so as to equalize the length of the limbs and prevent the development of lateral spinal curvature which would otherwise be inevitable. Mr. Adams advises that the patient should be made to lie down for at least half the day during all the period of active growth, and that he should practice suitable gymnastic exercises in the re- cumbent posture. In double dislocation, attempts have been made to prevent displacement by the application of a leather girdle or other compressing and restraining apparatus, but the remedy is irksome and inefficient. Tenotomy has been practised in these cases, by Guerin, Brodhurst, and others, but I confess that I do not see on what grounds; certainly in the examples of the affection which have come under my own observation, tenotomy could have been of no service. Excision of the hip is another operation which I cannot recommend in the treatment of congenital dislocation, although it has been adopted, and with alleged benefit, by Bose, Beylier, Ileusner, Margary, and perhaps other surgeons.]

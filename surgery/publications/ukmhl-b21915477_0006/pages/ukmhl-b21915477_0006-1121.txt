1061 LATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE. curvature, rotary curvature, and rotato-lateral curvature, have been suggested ; it is hardly worth while, however, to give up a term which has becoine estab- lished by use, merely to adopt a phrase which more fully conveys by its meaning the precise nature of the deformity; and indeed the term lateral curvature is not incorrect, for the twisted appearance of the column is simply due to the anterior portion of the spine being displaced to a greater degree than the posterior. The disturbance of the relative positions of the vertebrae at the seat of curvature, of necessity affects the direction of the transverse processes: these become on the convex side of the curve directed backwards and separated from one another; on the opposite side they are thrown forwards and brought into closer apposition. The articulating processes are also influenced by "the change in position of the several bones, for the weight of the body is no longer carried directly through the bodies of the vertebrae, but is directed laterally, and an undue amount of force is brought to bear upon the articular processes on the outer side of the curve ; it will readily be understood that under this extra pressure these processes give way and become absorbed, since at the period of life at which curvature is formed they are not fully developed, and have but little power of resisting the strain to which they are subjected. Changes in Intervertebral Disks.—The changes which are found in the soft parts of the column can be described in a few words, but although thus capa- ble of being briefly noticed, they are, as respects the condition of the inter- vertebral disks, well worthy of consideration. These bodies being firmly united to the surfaces of the vertebrae between which they are interposed, are rotated in a similar manner with the vertebrae at the curved portion of the column ; they also become compressed on the concave side of the curve and stretched on the opposite side, so that they are wedge-shaped from side to side, the base of the wedge being on the side of convexity. Together with this change in shape, it is highly probable that their physiological function is interfered with, and that they do not possess that elasticity which pertains to them when in the normal state. Of the other ligaments of the spine, those connecting the transverse processes—the inter-transverse—are the strongest of the lateral ligaments of the column ; they are shortened on the concavity and lengthened on the convexity of the curve ; and the same condi- tion exists in the fibrous bands which connect the bodies of the vertebrae and form the lateral ligaments of the spine. Classification of Cases.—These then are the chief points to be noticed in the anatomy of lateral curvature ; the external characters of the deformity in the living subject, and the effects produced upon the body by these changes in the structure of the spine, have next to be considered. In describing the external characters of lateral curvature, it is customary to classify the cases according to the nature of the displacement. The method usually adopted of grouping cases under the nomenclature of single curvature, double curva- ture, triple curvature, etc., according to the number of curves formed in the column, is decidedly open to objection; in no two instances will the condition of curvature present precisely similar features, so that if several cases of so- called double curvature are compared, they will be found to differ greatly in character. Some arrangement is, however, necessary for the convenience of description, and perhaps the most practical way of treating the subject will be to make a regional classification, and to consider first the condition presented by the formation of curvature in the lower two-thirds of the spine, which, as before stated, is the most frequent seat of deformity, noticing afterwards the more uncommon forms of the affection.

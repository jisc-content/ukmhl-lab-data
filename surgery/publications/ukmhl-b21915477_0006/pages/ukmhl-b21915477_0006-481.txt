425 EXPLORATION OP THE URETHRA AND BLADDER. sensitiveness of the organ, and as to the state of its walls, but may also recog- nize the presence of foreign bodies or calculi. I shall limit myself to this simple general presentation, waiting until a future time to dwell upon the exploratory manoeuvres appropriate to different cases. I shall only add that from the quantity of urine contained in the bladder, and from the force of the stream that hows from the catheter, it is possible to judge approximatively of the degree of contractility of the vesical walls. As complementary to the study of exploratory sounding, I think I ought to indicate here briefly the rules for evacuatory catheterization, so as not to have to return to it hereafter. Evacuatory Catheterization.—The instruments used to empty the bladder of urine, are metallic and flexible catheters. The first are of silver or German silver; they have a length of 30 centimetres, and a diameter of 5 millimetres ; their curve is very variable, and particular forms are specially suited for certain cases. The catheter most commonly used (Eig. 1310) has at its end a Fig. 1310. curve which forms a quarter of a circle, 8 or 9 centimetres in diameter; its handle is funnel-shaped, and bears at the sides two little rings, placed trans- versely, which may serve to fix it, and to indicate the position of the beak of the instrument. For the convenience of the surgeon, metallic catheters are made, composed of several pieces, so as to be taken apart and put in a Fig. 1311. pocket case. (Pig. 1311.) The so-called “ gum catheters” are generally made of a silk tissue, which constitutes the framework of the instrument, and upon

CLUB-FOOT. 1027 firmly with the left hand, the lingers being on the inner side and the palm of the hand pressed against the outer surface of the os ealeis ; the front of the foot is held by the extremities of the metatarsal bones, and then steadily dragged outwards as far as possible, again relaxed and brought over, and so on, as long as may be thought desirable; no pain should be given by using too much force, and the exercise must be slow and methodical. The value of these manipulations in reducing severe inversion of the foot is very great, whilst from their extreme simplicity they can easily be practised by any person possessed of ordinary intelligence. It may happen, in severe cases, that the inversion of the front of the foot is contributed to by contraction of the plantar fascia ; if this is the case, the resistance offered by the fascia, when endeavoring to evert the foot in the manner above described, will be readily detected, and the complete reduction of the inversion will have to be obtained during the second stage of treatment. The second stage of treatment is commenced by dividing the contracted tissues in the sole of the foot in the manner already described when discuss- ing the treatment of the first stage of talipes equinus ; the instrument used in the mechanical treatment after operation is of the same pattern as the Scarpaâ€™s shoe employed in cases of equinus, but the front part of the sole- plate is supplied with two additional cog-wheels, one which moves it from side to side, and another which rotates it so that either side of the plate can be raised or depressed. In applying the instrument, the sole-plate is set to correspond with the deformity ; by means of one cog-wheel it is lowered to a degree equal to the shortening of the sole, by the second it is turned inwards to accommodate it to the amount of inversion that may be present, and by the third the inner border is raised to the extent of rotation that is required; the heel-piece is next adjusted to suit the condition of equinus that exists. Having applied the instrument to the limb, first fastening the heel, then the leg, and finally the front of the foot, the three cog-wheels in the sole-plate are brought into use to draw the forepart of the foot, as much as can comfortably be borne, towards its natural position. This method of proce- dure is steadily carried on until the scaphoid and cuboid bones, together with the parts in front, are placed upon the astragalus and os calcis; here again manipulations are of great service in overcoming any deep-seated con- traction that does not readily yield to the pressure exerted by the shoe ; the foot is held in the manner previously described, and is worked in any direction that may be found necessary ; if inversion is the chief feature of deformity still existing, the front of the foot is drawn outwards; should the front of the foot remain depressed, it must be steadily forced upwards; if the outer border is on a lower level than the inner, a twisting movement is required.. These manipulations are only applicable to contraction of the ligaments directly connecting the several bones, and the surgeon must assure himself that it is upon this contraction, and not upon shortening of the superficial tissues, that resistance to reduction of the deformity depends; it not unfre- quently happens that section of the plantar fascia requires to be repeated a second, or even a third, time in varus of long standing and of severe grade. This second stage of treatment is the most important part in the manage- ment of the case; every endeavor must be made to render complete the reduction of the displaced bones in front of the os calcis and astragalus, and thus to restore the shape of the foot itself, before proceeding to overcome the condition of deformity existing at the ankle-joint. The third stage of treatment of advanced varus is practically the same as the second stage of that employed in talipes equinus, so that the account already given need not be repeated; it may be noticed, however, that, being a congenital deformity, the articular surfaces have not been properly devel-

561 HYDROCELE. or in glands situated higher up the lymph circulation. This explains the double en- largement of the inguinal glands in one-sided elephantiasis, and the so-called metastasis of the disease. Fig. 1365. Vaginal hydrocele with disease of testis: A, testicle enlarged and containing cheesy matter ; B, epididymis also showing strumous softening ; at C, C, the hydrocele appears to have been partitioned off into separate cysts, or to contain small cystic hydroceles. The quantity of fluid removed from a hydrocele, varies a good deal; about ten ounces is an average quantity, when the hydrocele is of a good size. Mr. Cline is said to have removed from Gibbon, the historian, who suffered from an enormous hydrocele, as much as six quarts. Mr. Curling questions the existence of multilocular hydroceles formed by the effusion of fluid into cysts caused by adhesions, such as have been described by some authors. Mr. Curling has called attention to a kind of sac or pouch often met with in hydroceles, situated on the inner side of the testicle, and the opening into which is to be found on the outer side, between the body of the testicle and the middle of the epididymis. As seen by museum specimens, the tunica vaginalis is very much thickened; the parts around, as in cases of old standing hernise, in consequence of the weight which they have to support, also become thickened. The cremaster muscle is hypertrophied, or spread out over the tumor and thinned; the tunica vaginalis is also thickened where it covers the testicle, which, how- ever, remains healthy. The disease occurs at all ages, but is most frequent in infancy and middle life, and is found generally on one side only, though it may be double. Most vol. vi.â€”36

1078 ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ation of the spinal column, it is of the first importance that the varying conditions of deflection should be clearly distinguished one from another ; that condition which has been described in this article as lateral curvature being the most grave condition of deformity, its treatment may well claim priority of consideration. The opinion is very generally held that all attempts to reduce the dis- tortion in a scoliosed spine are pretty sure to be attended by failure ; undoubtedly, when the distortion has existed for some years and has reached a severe grade of deformity, the restoration of the spine to its normal condi- tion is not possible by any methods of treatment with which we are at present acquainted ; it is also true that this advanced stage of deformity is very commonly met with, so that at first sight it might appear as though the relief of lateral curvature was in all its stages not attainable. There are many causes, however, which contribute to the development of lateral curva- ture, and to its advance to an incurable stage—causes which are beyond the control of the surgeon; the chief of these is the neglect often exhibited by the patient or her parents, to seek advice whilst the deformity is yet in its early stage. Unattended by any general failing of the health, as is so frequently the case, the first evidences of commencing curvature are disre- garded ; and the prominent shoulder, or hollow flank, is looked upon as merely one of those bodily defects which will disappear with advancing age, and that mysterious power which consists in “ growing out” of the defects, is trusted to put all straight with time. Even if the above mistake is avoided, and advice is sought for at the right time, it is not uncommon to find those who are especially interested in the well-doing of the patient, quite incapable of appreciating the absolute necessity which exists for carefully following out the methods of treatment which are ordered ; they fail to understand that so apparently slight a condition of bodily change may lead to a state of most sad deformity, and the instructions for the management of the case are so simple in their nature that they lack that attribute of im- pressiveness which is so necessary to the uneducated mind. In the treatment of lateral curvature, the means selected must vary according to the nature and condition of the displacement; with reference to this point, authorities usually describe the deformity as passing through three stages, a first stage of incipient or commencing curvature, a second stage of established curva- ture, and a third stage of confirmed or incurable curvature. The distinction between the first and second stages is often made by defining the latter as that period at which rotation of the vertebrae occurs; this is an error which has arisen from an inability to distinguish between the different forms of lateral deflection, the so-called first stage of lateral curvature being in fact merely lateral bending of the spine, for, as has already been described in this article, lateral curvature from its first commencement is accompanied by rota- tion of the vertebrae, the displacement of the bodies of the vertebrae always preceding the deviation of the spinous processes. The stage of curvature is by no means the chief point which is to be considered; of far more importance are the nature and position of the curves formed in the spine, with reference to which the nature of the treatment must be adapted to meet the peculiarities of each particular case.' With regard to the commencing stage of lateral curvature, there are certain general rules which are applicable to all cases. The departure from the nor- mal condition of the spine which has to be dealt with at this period, consists in the deviation to one or other side of the bodies of a certain number ot the vertebrae: if the dorsal region be affected, there will be some prominence of the scapula on the side to which the bodies are turned, with perhaps a little elevation of the shoulder; in the lumbar region, there will be slight fulness

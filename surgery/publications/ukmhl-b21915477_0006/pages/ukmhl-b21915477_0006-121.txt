69 OPERATIVE TREATMENT OP INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. porte, Bulteau, and Peyrot, in France; Treves, in England; and Whitall, Sands, and myself, in America. In an article already alluded to, published in 1874, I collected 74 cases of this operation, and in the successive editions of my “Principles and Practice of Surgery,” I have largely added to these figures, so that my list now embraces 846 cases, a greater number than has heretofore been brought together. In the accompanying tables, I have given references to all the cases of which I have sufficient knowledge, classifying them according to the nature of the affection for which the operation was performed. A considerably number of cases, chiefly fatal, may be found noted in the statistical reports of various hospitals, but without particulars, and without the names of the operators. An analysis of these tables shows that the mortality of the operation in terminated cases of all kinds has been over 69 per cent.; that the least un- favorable cases are those of obstruction by foreign bodies, gall-stones, etc., and by pressure from sources external to the bowel; and that the gravest •cases are those of intussusception, followed closely in the rate of mortality by those of internal strangulation and volvulus. The figures bearing upon these points may be compendiously seen in the annexed summary:—- Analysis of 346 Cases of Laparotomy for Intestinal Obstruction EMBRACE!) IN TABLES I. IX.

For convenience of comparison, I have appended an analysis of the 190 cases collected by Dr. Schramm :— Analysis of 190 Cases of Laparotomy for Intestinal Obstruction EMBRACED IN Dr. SCHRAMM’S TABLES.2 Nature of obstruction.

CLUB-FOOT. 1011 operative treatment, which involves the subcutaneous division of contracted tissues; and physiological treatment, as it is called, which is the employment of manipulative exercises, shampooing, galvanism, and other allied processes. In the several conditions of equinus, these methods of treatment, one or all, are employed according to the nature of the existing distortion. Taking lirst a case of paralytic equinus, with partial recovery of the anterior muscles, and the foot in the condition represented in Fig. 14(36, the treatment to be adopted for the relief of the deformity, which is one of the type most com- monly met with, must be directed to remedy the distortion of the foot itself, and to overcome any obstacle that may exist to the free movement of the foot upon the leg. The distortion of the foot consists chiefly in a displacement of the scaphoid and cuboid bones from the astragalus and os calcis, the anterior part of the foot being in fact partially dislocated from the posterior at the trans- verse tarsal joint; this displacement is maintained by acquired contraction of the plantar fascia, and possibly also by shortening of the superficial muscles of the sole of the foot. Movement at the ankle-joint is restricted by some contraction of the Achilles tendon, and also by want of use; in such cases the foot cannot be flexed beyond the right angle, or this movement may be still more limited. The chief characteristic of deformity is the distortion of the foot proper, and to reduce this must be the first object of treatment, the relief of the impeded movement of the ankle-joint being attempted afterward. This course of action is pursued because the fixing of the os calcis, and with it the astragalus, is of great help to the surgeon in using measures for reduc- ing the distortion of the foot; for, just as in the case of a dislocated limb, lie thus obtains an immovable base on which to return the displaced parts; if, on the contrary, the mobility of the ankle-joint be first restored, the want of stability of the posterior bones will render the reduction of the distorted foot a very difficult task, if not an impossibility. The first step in treatment is to overcome by subcutaneous section the con- traction of the tissues in the sole of the foot, and care must be exercised to ascertain what is the amount of structural shortening present; it is not always possible to decide this point with exactness, for the tightened super- ficial tissues may hide the contraction of deeper structures. The sole of the foot must be put on the stretch by fixing the heel and forcing forwards the forepart of the foot, when the greatest resistance to extension will usually be found to be at the inner border of the plantar fascia; in order to dis- cover the full degree of contraction, the nail of the fore-finger should be pressed against the inner edge of the tightened band, as though trying to hook around it, and should be pushed up into the sole to discover if possible the depth to which the contraction extends. In performing the operation, the patient is so placed that the plantar surface is directed upwards, and an assistant holds the foot and stretches the contracted tissues by making a moderate degree of extension; a sharp-pointed tenotome, with a good stiff blade about an inch or an inch and a quarter in length, according to the extent of contraction present, is selected, and is passed through the skin about an eighth of an inch from, and with the flat side directed towards, the inner edge of the band; the blade is pushed onwards and made to sweep around the whole of the contracted tissues, when the edge is turned, and, the assistant extending the foot as much as possible, the resisting structures are divided with a few even strokes of the blade. The knife is next withdrawn, and the puncture closed with the finger whilst the foot is examined, to discover if any portion of contracted muscle or fascia still remains undivided ; such will be the case if the knife has not been carried deeply enough, or sufficiently to the outer side, when making the first incision; then the tenotome must be -entered again at the puncture and the necessary division* completed.

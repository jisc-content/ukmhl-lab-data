Molliere and of Robin, of Lyons, the magnificent results of which are multiplying every day. Local Inflammatory Rachitis.—It remains for me to mention a variety of rachitis in adolescents which is as yet but little known, I believe, and which may he called local inflammatory rachitis, in order to suggest the influence under which it is produced, and its limitation to the bone or bones Fig. 1452. Specimen of local Inflammatory rachitis of adolescents (late rachitis occurring in an inflamed bone, Ollier). Longitudinal section of the lower end of a fernur, the upper end of which had been the seat of chronic osteitis in a case of coxalgia. A, connecting cartilage unbroken, but thicker than in the normal state; a, a, a, a, a, carti- laginous islets which have taken the place of the connecting cartilage and have invaded in an irregular way both the epiphysis and the diaphysis ; B, spongy tissue which separates them ; C, lower epiphysis, some points of which are medullized ; c, c ; D, D, mednllized portions of the juxta-epiphyseal region of the diaphysis upon which rachitic chondro-spongioid proliferations encroach ; E, compact tissue of the diaphysis as thin as paper, the medullary canai Delng very much enlarged. inflamed. Inflammation (simple osteitis, tuberculous osteitis, caries, etc.) may cause at the other extremity of the bone, that not originally diseased, an arrest of ossification at the position of the connecting cartilage, together

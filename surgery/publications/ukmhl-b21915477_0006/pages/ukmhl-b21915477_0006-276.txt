To Jacobson, a Danish surgeon, is due the credit of demonstrating, in 1831, that stones of considerable dimensions might be crushed by simple pressure, without previous perforation. His instrument, the mechanism of which is sufficiently clear (Figs. 1201 and 1202), did very well for the first crushing, Fig. 1201. but it was difficult to pick up the broken fragments with the loop, and the smaller the fragments the harder became the task, so that although the instrument enjoyed considerable and well merited popularity, it is no longer used. Meantime attempts to apply the crushing power more conveniently were made in England and in France. Amussat had already, in 1822, devised a Fig. 1203.

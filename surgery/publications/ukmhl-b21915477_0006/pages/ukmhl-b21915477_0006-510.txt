The spongy body lias lost its reticulated appearance; its meshes are infil- trated with a yellowish or grayish material, which gives the parts the appear- Fig. 1325.

In front of and behind the constricted portion, the ure- thral tissues resume little by little their normal character ; behind it, how- ever, the mucous membrane is often red, softened, and furred, occasionally even ulcerated in some places. Microscopic examination reveals at the point of stricture, in addition to the epithelial proliferation of which I have already spoken, a connective- tissue new formation, which begins in the mucous membrane and extends thence to the whole thickness of the walls of the urethra. The development of epithelium is often abundant enough to sensibly diminish the calibre of the canal; further, the most superficial cells, as they exfoliate, become ne- crosed and mingle with the products of secretion in the glands, giving rise to the discharge which is so often seen in individuals who have strictures of the urethra. But it is in the connective-tissue new formation that the essen- Inflammatory stricture in its lightest form. (After Voillemier.)

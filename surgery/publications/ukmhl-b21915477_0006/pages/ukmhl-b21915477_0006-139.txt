It is, of course, a more dangerous operation than laparo-enterotomy; but, on the other hand, offers, as that does not, a prospect of perfect and permanent cure. The operations of enterectomy and laparo-enterectomy may each be done in two ways: (1) the diseased portion of bowel may be simply cut away, and the ends attached to the external wound so as to form an arti- ficial anus ; (2) after resecting the diseased segment, the ends may be approx- imated with sutures and the gut returned into the abdominal cavity. The latter plan is the proper one in cases of fecal fistula, and in some cases of obstruction very high up in the small intestine, as in the duodenum, where the establishment of an artificial anus would very much interfere with the patient’s nutrition; but in all ordinary cases of intestinal obstruction, as in gangrene after strangulated hernia, it is safest at first to make an artificial anus, and on a subsequent occasion, if necessary, to attempt to restore the continuity of the intestine. In cases of hernia and fecal fistula, the operation is performed at the seat of disease; in other cases it is better, as a rule, to make the incision in the course of the linea alba, and endeavor to bring the affected bowel to the median line, where, after resection, its ends can be most conveniently fastened; but if this cannot be done, a second incision must be made directly over the obstructed part. It is often of the greatest importance, in this operation, to prevent the extravasation of blood and fecal matter into the abdomen ; hence, as soon as the diseased portion of bowel is exposed, it should be well drawn out, and the external wound either closed as far as possible, or filled with soft sponges so as to cut off’ all communication with the parts within.

707 TUMORS OF THE VULVA. static forceps used; or the plan of Schroeder,1 or that of Munde,2 may be fol- lowed. Schroeder begins cutting away the growth at its lowest part, and at once stitches the borders of the incision together, and thus proceeds step by step, to the upper part, immediate union of the wound by deep stitches following the process of excision. The following illustrations show, first, the mass to be removed (Fig. 1399), and then the united wound after the removal (Fig. 1400). Munde resorted to the ingenious method of pass- ing under the base of the tumor three strong pins, and beneath their pro- jecting ends an elastic ligature, thus pedunculating the tumor; the tumor was then excised without loss of blood, though after the removal of the pins and ligature several vessels had to be tied.

In some cases the disease returns, and in rare instances the operation is fol- lowed by death; this event occurred in only one of forty cases analyzed by Cellard. Tumors of the Vulva. Cysts.—Most vulvar cysts originate from the vulvo-vaginal glands3 or from their excretory ducts, and are retention-cysts.

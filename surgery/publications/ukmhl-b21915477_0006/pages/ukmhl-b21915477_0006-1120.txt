1060 ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY. Lateral curvature of the spine is of very frequent occurrence, the subjects most liable to the deformity being females, in whom there would appear to be a special tendency to the formation of curvature at two periods of life: first, during early childhood, and secondly, during early adolescence. Except that it may be considered a disease which especially affects civilized commu- nities, it is not limited to any particular class of humanity; it is generally said that the complaint is principally to be met with amongst the better classes, and therefore in those addicted to habits of luxury; but there can be no doubt that the poor are frequently the subjects of lateral curvature: of the three thousand cases of deformity already alluded to as having been classi- fied from the patients attending the National Orthopgedic Hospital of London, in 937 there were affections of the spinal column, and of these 353, or nearly 38 per cent., were examples of lateral curvature. Nature and Characteristics op Deformity in Lateral Curvature.— The spine is liable to become curved laterally either in the cervical, dorsal, or lumbar regions, but the most frequent seat of curvature is in the lower two- thirds of the column, that is, below the fourth dorsal vertebra. The situa- tion and condition of distortion are greatly varied in different cases; thus there may be one long curve extending through several vertebrae, with another short curve; or there may be two curves of equal length, and so on; but in whatever part of the spine the curvature may be located, the structural changes at the seat of curvature will invariably present the same character- istics, and will differ only in degree. The changes in the condition of the spine which constitute the deformity are well marked ; it will be convenient to inquire first what are these changes, and to examine the morbid anatomy of lateral curvature, before considering the symptoms and appearances pre- sented during life ; for much confusion has arisen from a want of discrimina- tion between other affections in which lateral deflection of the spine exists, but which differ most materially in their nature from true lateral curvature. Pathological Anatomy of Lateral Curvature.—The condition of the spine when curvature has been formed, is somewhat remarkable; if the ante- rior surface of the column be examined, it will be found that the vertebrae are displaced from the median line, the extreme point of deflection being usually at the middle of the curve. The natural relations of the bodies of the vertebrae, throughout the curve, are so altered that their surfaces on the side of con- cavity are brought abnormally close together, whilst on the convex side they are unduly separated—a condition which is the natural consequence of the bending of the column. In addition to this, the vertebrae are changed in position in such a manner that their anterior surfaces are directed laterally, and face towards the convexity of the curve instead of directly forwards. On examining the posterior surface of the spine, the curve will be found to be much less marked than on the anterior surface, and the lateral displace- ment of the spinous processes will not be proportionate to that of the bodies of the vertebrae. This excess of displacement of the anterior portion of the column is commonly described as “ horizontal rotation of the vertebrte,” from the fact that the segments of the spine present the appearance of being turned around on their axes.1 From the occurrence of this peculiar condition of dis- tortion, the spine looks as though it had been twisted, wherefore the use of the term lateral curvature has been objected to, and others, such as serpentine 1 The term “rotation of the vertebrae” is open to objection, but it has become established by use, and will be employed in this article to express the condition to which it has been ordinarily applied. The reasons for objecting to the term are referred to under the subject of etiology of lateral curvature.

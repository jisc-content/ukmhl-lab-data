INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 458 been reported by Charles Bell, Berard, Thompson, and some other surgeons. This occlusion results, not from incessant contraction of the stricture, but from the inflammation which necessarily accompanies the formation of fis- tulse, and which is propagated to the strictured part, robbing it of its epithe- lium, and permitting the apposed surfaces to contract adhesions and become agglutinated. What proves this, is that occlusion begins in front of the fistulae and very rarely extends backwards. The rest of the canal, although not traversed by the urine, preserves its permeability, and almost its normal calibre. The portion thus obliterated is transformed into a fibrous cord, in which no trace of its original structure is found. There remains, to complete the pathological anatomy of strictures of the urethra, the examination of a certain number of subsidiary questions, relative to their number, their situation, their length, and their general disposition. The number of strictures is variable. According to Ducamp, it is usually one or two, rarely four or five. Hunter has met with six, Lallemand eight, and Leroy d’Etiolles eleven. But it is in the living that these authors have established the existence of so considerable a number of strictures. On the cadaver Voillemier has usually found only one, sometimes two, never more than three. It is possible, in certain cases, to be convinced of the presence of an indeterminate number of strictures, when in reality there is only a single stricture, occupying the whole length of the canal, but more pro- nounced at certain points. Length.—In certain altogether exceptional cases, the urethra is strictured in almost the whole of its extent: most frequently the strictures are short. Fig. 1330. Traumatic stricture.

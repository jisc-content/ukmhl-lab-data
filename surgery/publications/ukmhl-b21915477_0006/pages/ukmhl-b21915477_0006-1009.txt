OSTEOMALACIA AND FRAGILITAS OSSIUM. 949 (d) Ribs and Sternum, Thorax.—The sternum and the ribs are the seat of a greater number of fractures than the other bones. The non-consolidation of these fractures, together with softening, causes the thorax to have, so to speak, no regular form ; it takes that which is imposed upon it by position and by gravitation, as if the viscera were shut up in a cloth bag. When the patient is lying down upon his back, the transverse diameter is increased; the thorax is flattened, the belly spreads out, and this ett'ect is the more manifest because the trunk is shortened and crowded together, in con- sequence of the sinking down and deviations of the spinal column. When the patient lies upon his flanks, the antero-posterior diameter is the longer, and the sternum makes a very marked prominence in front, so that the appearance of the thorax recalls the conformation of a pigeon’s breast, to which the breast of the osteomalacic is commonly compared. (e) ScapidcE.—The scapulae are drawn forward by the shortening of the clavicles, they are separated behind, and become prominent; for which reason they are called “winged.” They are twisted around the thorax by the action of the muscles, and so present a greater depression in front. (/) Pelvis.—This presents the most typical deformities, according toVolk- mann; they at least attract the most attention from accoucheurs, who are Fig. 1454.

719 UKO-GENITAL FISTULA. passed, a perforated shot being then placed over the two ends of each suture, and firmly compressed; this is known as Bozeman’s button-suture. In order to facilitate the operation Simon passed two threads through the cervix, and by these drew the uterus, and with it the fistula, downwards, thus rendering the latter more accessible. Simon’s method is illustrated in Fig. 1404. The patient is supposed to be lying upon her back; the fistulous margin has been denuded, but the sutures are not yet introduced. Fig. 1404. Simon’s operation for vesioo-vaginal fistula. Having referred to some of the peculiar methods of different operators, I shall in the following description speak chiefly of that used by Sims and Emmet, and by those who adopt their method, which is especially known as the “ American method.” The patient is etherized, and lie's upon her left side, the perineum being retracted with a Sims’s speculum; if the form and position of the fistula will permit, the edges should be united by stitches passing from below upwards, rather than from side to side; in other words, a transverse fistula, such as is represented in Fig. 1404, can be closed more readily, and with greater probability of success, than if' the fistula is longi- tudinal. If the fistula be large and if the vesical wall protrude into the vagina, a sponge may be used to push it back and keep it from again protruding;

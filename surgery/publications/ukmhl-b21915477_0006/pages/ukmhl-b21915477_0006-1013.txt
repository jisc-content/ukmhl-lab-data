There is also found constantly in the medullary cells, coloring matter, in the form of yel- low or brown pigment. This pigmentation of the cells is caused by the extravasations of blood which have been already mentioned.” In Fig. 1457 I give a histological section. In it will be noticed the en- largement of the Haversian canals, the semilunar scallopping of their edges, which are eroded as in osteitis. The Germans lay great stress upon the presence of multinuclear cells (the osteoclasts of Kolliker, of Wegner, of Roki- Fig. 1457.

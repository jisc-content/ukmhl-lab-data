INJURIES AND DISEASES OF TIIE URETHRA. 492 Hypospadia once recognized, it is important to carefully investigate the conditions which may influence the operative indications: presence or absence of an anterior urethra; degree and nature of the incurvation; presence or absence of the testicles; well-marked atrophy of the penis. Prognosis.—If glandular hypospadia induces in the great majority of cases only trifling inconveniences, the existence of a penile, scrotal, or perineo- scrotal hypospadia, places the individual who is afflicted with this vice of con- formation in a most painful physical and moral situation, which gives to the variety we are considering an altogether peculiar gravity; a gravity, how- ever, which has been much diminished since it has been shown that perineo- scrotal hypospadia, which constitutes the most advanced degree of the mal- formation, far from being beyond the resources of art, as was formerly believed, is amenable to surgical relief, and that individuals who are afflicted with it may have restored, at the same time with symmetry of external form, the faculty of accomplishing normally their genital and urinary functions. Treatment.—A certain number of attempts were made by the older surgeons, with the object of forming summarily an artificial canal in the substance of the glans and cavernous bodies, by means of a red hot iron or trocar. These rude and barbarous procedures furnish a remedy to none of the con- comitant malformations, and insure, as a necessary and inevitable consequence, stricture of the new canal, and finally its obliteration. Bouisson first dealt practically with the question of the surgical treatment of hypospadia, and gave this question a considerable impetus. He showed that it was necessary, before thinking of making a new canal from the hypospadic opening to the extremity of the glans, to place the penis in a con- dition to accomplish its functions by effecting the disappearance of the incurvation of this organ, which helps to make the emission of urine and spermatic fluid troublesome, and obstructs coitus more or less completely. For this he advised, first, to incise the ridge which represents the urethra transversely, and, as this operation was generally insufficient to completely straighten the penis, to practise at a later time subcutaneous section of the fibrous envelope, and of the septum of the corpora cavernosa. In regard to the formation of a new canal, Professor Bouisson comprehended perfectly that, in cases in which the urethra was wanting over a considerable extent of the lower surface of the penis, it was necessary to have recourse to urethro- plasty, that is to say, to borrowing tegumentary flaps from the neighboring parts; he further insisted on the necessity of finding flaps which could be reversed in such a manner as to present their epidermic surface to the cavity of the new canal, in order to prevent its consecutive contraction. I shall not dwell on the operative procedure adopted by Bouisson, and followed by failure in the single case in which it was put into practice, and I shall only mention that of Moutet, which appears to me to complicate the preceding one without adding to its chances of success. The operation practised in 1874, by Theophile Anger, on a young man of sixteen years, affected with penile or peno-scrotal hypospadia, effected, on the contrary, a complete cure. I shall not repeat here the objections which may be urged against the procedure adopted by this surgeon, a procedure which was absolutely identical with that which, as early as 1869, Professor Thiersch, of Leipsic, had described and practised in a case of epispadia, contenting myself with referring my readers to the first of the two papers which I have pub- lished upon this subject.1 I have now reached the method which is personal to myself, and which, applied to the treatment of hypospadia, even when most complicated, always 1 Archives Generales de Medecine, Mai et Juin, 1874.

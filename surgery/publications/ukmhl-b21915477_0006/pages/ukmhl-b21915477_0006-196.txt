144 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE RECTUM. [Inflammation of the Rectal Pouches. Under the names of Encysted Rectum (Physick) and Sacciform, Disease oj the Anus (Gross), has been described an inflamed or ulcerated state of the rectal pouches or lacunae, which sometimes, particularly in old persons, become enlarged, and serve as receptacles for fecal matter. The symptoms of this affection are intense itching and often severe pain, hut without spasm of the sphincter. The diagnosis may he made by exploring the gut with a bent probe or blunt hook. The treatment consists in drawing down the affected pouches and excisiug with curved scissors the folds of mucous membrane at their base. Recto-vesical Fistula. An abnormal opening between the rectum and bladder may be due to con- genital defect,1 to ulceration, usually malignant in character, or to a wound, as occasionally happens in the operation of lithotomy. As a result, urine escapes into the bowel, and, if the opening be large, fecal matter may enter the bladder, causing great pain and irritation. In some cases, an attempt may be made to close the fistula by the application of caustics or the galvano- cautery, or by a plastic operation analogous to that employed in cases of vesico-vaginal fistula, but in cases of malignant ulceration palliative meas- ures are all that can ordinarily be recommended, though colotomy (preferably by Amussatâ€™s method2) may be occasionally justifiable. Recto-urethral fistula will be considered in the article on Injuries and Diseases of the Urethra.] 1 Set; page 9.9, supra, 2 See page 78, supra.

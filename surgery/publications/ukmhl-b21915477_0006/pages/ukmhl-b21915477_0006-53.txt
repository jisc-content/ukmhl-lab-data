"Wounds and Ruptures of the (Esophagus. Wounds of the (Esophagus.—The whole of the oesophagus is so well pro- tected from ordinary injury that unintentional wounds of any portion of the healthy organ are quite rare. They occur in the usual varieties of contused, incised, punctured, lacerated, and gunshot wounds. They may be superficial or penetrating. They may interest the cervical or the thoracic portion of the oesophagus. Wounds in the thoracic portion are almost exclusively punctured or lacerated in character, the depth of that portion of the organ greatly protecting it from contused and incised wounds. The lesion may he produced by an injury from without or by an injury from within. Wounds from without occur most frequently as the result of military encounters, duels, attempts at assassination, or attempts at suicide. Wbunds from within are produced most frequently In’ pointed, sharp, or jagged foreign bodies impacted in the tube. In several cases severe wounds have been received by jugglers in the feat of sword-swallowing. Wounds from without are most frequently associated with wounds of the air-passages, lungs, or great cervical bloodvessels. For anatomical reasons they are much more frequent in the cervical than in the thoracic portion of the oesophagus. Wounds from within are more frequently isolated than associated with wounds of other structures. Nevertheless, the peculiarity of circumstance may produce an unusual com- plication, as in the cases of three sword-swallowers. The one violently pushed the blunt end of his sword past an obstacle felt in his oesophagus, and it penetrated the anterior wall of the gullet and passed into the pericardium. A second pierced the pericardium in an attempt to swallow a

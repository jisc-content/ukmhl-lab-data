942 SCROFtTLO-TUBERCULOlJS AND OTHER STRUCTURAL DISEASES OF BONES. with a defect of ossification in the subperiosteal osteogenic layers, and medullization of the old hone; whence arise the porous state of the spongy tissue and the thinning of the compact layer of the diaphysis. At the position of the connecting cartilage there is found only a thin rim of cartilage, with masses of cartilaginous nodules separated by spongy tissue and occupying a space of several centimetres. It is evident that these rachitic changes must be referred to the inflammation at a distance, to the disturbances of the circulation which it causes, and to the immobilization of the affected limb, and that they are further favored by the general malnutrition resulting from the constitutional condition and from want. M. Ollier, who taught me to recognize this form of rachitis, has given me permission to republish the drawing made by M. Mondan, of a specimen which I found in his rich bone collection. The specimen was obtained from a young girl of fifteen years, who was treated by capillary puncture and immobilization for a suppurating coxalgia, and who, when she was almost cured of this articular affection, died in the Hotel-Dieu with symptoms of tuberculous nephritis and meningitis.

Longitudinal section of the healthy femur of the same patient. tudinal sections of the lower end of the diseased femnr and of the healthy femur, so that by contrast the rachitic changes which I have just described may be better understood.

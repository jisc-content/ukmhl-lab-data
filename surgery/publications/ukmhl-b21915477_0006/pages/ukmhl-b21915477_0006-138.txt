Amussat. < i Personal communication. An analysis of these tables shows that of the whole 351 cases, 133 ended fatally, a mortality in determined cases of 37.9 per cent. The most favorable cases are those of intestinal fistula, of which only 10 per cent, end in death, and the least favorable those of imperforate rectum, of which more than half (52.9 per cent.) prove fatal. As regards the form of operation, it may be said, in general terms, that more than one-third die after colotomy by Amussat’s or Callisen’s method,1 and more than one-half when Littre’s plan is adopted. These points may be conveniently seen in the annexed summaries:— 1 Callisen’s differs from Amussat’s operation merely in the fact that the external incision is longitudinal instead of transverse.

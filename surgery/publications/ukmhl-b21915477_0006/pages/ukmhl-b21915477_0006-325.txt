Gross’s artery compressor. The rectal tampon is highly spoken of by Kerr, of Canton. The ceirtre of a square piece of cloth, ivell oiled, is pressed into the anus, and a narrow roller bandage packed gradually into it until enough pressure has been made upon the deep parts of the wound to arrest all hemorrhage. Sometimes a little digital pressure is made upon the tampon for a few hours, the plug being pushed up against the symphysis. An anodyne may be required to allay tenesmus while the tampon is in place. Kerr says that from six to eighteen hours is long enough to allow the tampon to remain. The shirted canula (Fig. 1265) is a tampon consisting of a central tube of metal, around which near one end is gathered the small opening; of a conical bag of coarse muslin. The bag is greased and inserted well into the wound, so that one end may lie in the vesical cavity. The conical sac is now stuffed on all sides with a thin roller bandage, until enough pressure has been brought to bear upon the sides of the wound to arrest all oozing, and then the tube is tied in. This is an excellent instrument, and even arterial hemorrhage may be arrested by its careful use. It is allowed to remain twenty-four hours or longer, according to the extent and kind of hemorrhage for the arrest of which it has been employed. The urine escapes through the tube, and

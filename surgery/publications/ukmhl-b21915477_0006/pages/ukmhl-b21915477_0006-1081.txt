CLUB-FOOT. 1021 have upon the foetus has often been discussed, but, although cases have been quoted in support of the sympathetic development of certain abnormalities, little more has been proved than can be explained by the laws of coincidence. Even supposing that in a certain number of cases the evidence of mental disturbance is to be traced, nevertheless, in the large majority of instances, no such history is given ; again, the mother’s account must always be received with some suspicion, for, regarding the club-footed infant as a reflection upon her constructive abilities, she eagerly catches at the some- what poetical idea of having received a shock during pregnancy upon seeing some unfortunate cripple, and thus satisfactorily relieves herself of all responsibility in the matter. In support of the theory that congenital varus results from pressure of the uterus, it has been argued that the natural position of the feet of a foetus corresponds to the abnormal condition of deformity ; and that if from deficiency in amount of the liquor amnii, or other cause, the foetus is unduly pressed upon, congenital varus is established. If this explanation were correct, the lower extremities would also participate in the deformity, and would retain the flexed position which they had assumed in utero ; moreover, the greater the distortion of the foot the more severe would have been the pressure of the uterus, and even supposing that the foetus was able to live under such a con- dition, there would of necessity be developed a corresponding state of defor- mity in other parts of the body. That arrest of development has any productive effect in the origin of varus, is disproved by the fact that the feet are usually abnormal only in shape, and that, except in severe cases, there is no defect in tissue-formation of the bones, muscles, or ligaments. Deformity of the foot is occasionally the result of arrest of development, but such cases are comparatively rare, and when so produced the distortion is always accompa- nied by very distinct evidence of defective construction, such as the absence of one or more toes, smallness of the limb, and similar conditions. It is in the existence of disordered nervous influence, and consequent muscular disturbance, that we must seek for the cause of congenital club-foot. And here the question arises, From what form of nerve lesion does the deformity originate'.'1 Is it from loss of nerve-function with paralysis of the muscles, or from nerve-irritation with spastic muscular contraction? Undoubtedly the weight of evidence is strongly in favor of the latter theory. In support of the theory that paralysis of the muscles which Ilex and abduct the foot—the extensors of the toes and the peronei—first occurs, and that the extensors and abductors overpower tlieir weakened opponents and so cause the deformity, it has been urged that the distortion can easily be reduced soon after birth by drawing the foot into its normal position, and by thus giving assistance to the feeble muscles. In slight cases of deformity the foot can be thus readily placed in position, and in such cases the child when stretching out the legs exerts sufficient muscular power to overcome the distortion ; but if the muscles were paralyzed, it would, from the very nature of their condition, be impossible for them under any circumstances to overcome their more power- ful opponents, whilst if the ease with which the deformity could be overcome were to be taken as a sign of paralysis existing, then no matter to what degree distortion had been developed, reduction should be effected with equal facility in all cases,'because in all the resisting force would be the same. The theory that spasmodic contraction of the gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posticus and anticus muscles, is the cause of congenital club-foot, is supported by the fact that these muscles are always more or less firmly contracted, and that the degree of resistance to reduction of the deformity is directly proportionate to the amount of muscular shortening which is present; moreover, the dis- placement of the bones exactly corresponds to the effect which would be

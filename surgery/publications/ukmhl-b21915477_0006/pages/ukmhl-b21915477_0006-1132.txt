ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY. 1072 none was so likely to produce displacement of the column as that of abnor- mal muscular contraction. Various theories have been advanced in regard to the method by which the symmetry of the spine is destroyed by the action of the muscles of the trunk. Spasmodic muscular contraction must be noticed as one of the ascribed causes of lateral curvature, but upon this theory it is not necessary to dwell at any length ; spasmodic contraction of the muscles of the trunk is very seldom met with, and when such does occur, the muscles are gener- ally affected alike on both sides, so that the body is drawn directly backwards and not laterally. Further, it may be remarked that nerve-irritation and muscular spasm are essentially affections of early childhood, whilst lateral curvature is in the large majority of cases developed at a later period of life. The influence of muscular action in the causation of lateral curvature, has been more generally regarded, not as the first, but as the exciting cause of deformity; as predisposing causes are given, debility—the result of exhaust- ing disease such as scarlet fever—weakness from rapid growth, over-exertion of the bodily strength, irregularity of the menstrual function, the non-ob- servance of proper hygienic rules, and other like conditions which induce a feeble state of health. Such depression of the bodily powers may or may not precede the formation of lateral curvature, but if pre-existing, how the muscles thereupon become the instruments which promote distortion of the spine, is not very clear ; this is shown by the want of agreement amongst authorities who are of one opinion in ascribing the formation of curvature to muscular action, but who differ very much as to the precise manner in which that influence acts upon the spine. The theory of excited muscular action which obtains the most support, is explained by pointing to the practice which is common amongst young girls, especially those who are not very robust, of adopting bad habits of position, such as standing on one leg and sitting awry, whereby the pelvis is tilted and the spine kept in a condition of curvature. By thus habitually bending the spine in one direction, it is assumed that, on the side towards which the col- umn is inclined, the muscles become shortened, and that contraction of their fibres results, establishing a confirmed condition of deformity. It is well- known that, in the treatment of a fractured limb, if a joint be fixed in the flexed position fora lengthened period, it will become contracted from shorten- ing of the flexor muscles; but we know also that if the joint be moved even once a day to the full amount of its proper extension, such contraction will be pre- vented. In the case of the spine, even if there be this habit of constantly tilting the pelvis, it must be allowed that frequent changes in the position of the body are assumed, and that the muscles are sufficient!y often relaxed to prevent them from becoming permanently shortened; moreover, during sleep the muscles are rested, for although it was formerly argued that by lying on a feather bed the pelvis was kept uneven at night, in these days feather beds are seldom used, and the firmer couch now universally adopted keeps the spine in good position. There is a class of subjects, in whom, when standing, the pelvis is always tilted—those who from some cause suffer from shortening of one lower extremity ; such subjects are declared by many authors to be especially liable to acquire lateral curvature. My own experience is quite opposed to such a statement; among the many applicants to the Surgical Aid Society of London, investigation has failed to discover the complication of lateral curvature in those who apply for instruments to remedy the shortening of a limb ; this is the more noteworthy because the greater num- ber of these cases are of the very poorest class, suffering from lameness due to disease of the hip-joint, to excision of the knee, to paralysis of one limb, and to various causes which clearly indicate a defective condition of health.

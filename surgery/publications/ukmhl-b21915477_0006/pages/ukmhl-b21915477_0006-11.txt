PREFACE Vll on Sabre, Bayonet, and Arrow Wounds will always be classical; and, quite recently, the venerable Prof. Post, of New York, long a connect- ing link with a past generation of surgeons, but who despite his burden of years, which measurably exceeded the allotted three-score-and-ten, preserved full activity of mind and hand, and who, with the wisdom and long experience of age, was able to combine a boldness and operative skill which might well be envied by younger surgeons. The death- roll of Contributors to the Encyclopaedia, actual or promised, now numbers ten—all the Editor’s countrymen—whose names are repro- duced here in honorem, a list of surgeons of whom America may well be proud : Gross and Van Buren ; Otis and Bill ; Lidell and Hod- gen ; Hodge and Hunter ; Post and Sims. In completing his task, which has occupied all his leisure moments for more than six years, and has involved an amount of anxiety and labor which few can appreciate who have not been engaged in similar undertakings, the Editor begs to renew the expression, given in the Preface to the First Volume, of his sincere thanks to the distinguished surgeons, both in Europe and in his own country, who have toiled with him in the preparation of the Encyclopaedia, and to whose cheerfully rendered collaboration is due the great success which the work has obtained. To the Publishers too, and to the numerous subscribers to the work, he owes thanks for the patient indulgence which they have extended to him in regard to the unavoidable delays which have attended the appearance of the several volumes. JOHN ASHHURST, Jr. Philadelphia, 2000 West Delancey Place, March, 1886.

625 CYSTIC DISEASE OF THE TESTIS. Cystic Disease of the Testis. Cystic disease, cystoma, or the “ hydatid disease of the testicle” of Sir A. Cooper, is rarely met with. The disease described hy him was a purely local one, non-malignancy being the essential characteristic of the growth, which was formed of cysts and fibrous tissue only. Modern observers have, how- ever, noticed that often it is associated with sarcomatous or carcinomatous structure, and is apt to run an unsatisfactory course. They have therefore recognized two kinds, the non-malignant and the malignant: in the former, which is more common than the latter, the cysts are lined with tesselated epithelium ; in the latter they contain nucleated cells, and the patient is liable to a return of the disease after its removal, and to constitutional infection. Fig. 1375. Cystic sarcoma of testis. A middle-aged man, in excellent health, notices by accident, after a blow or a squeeze, that one of his testicles is larger than it ought to be. The swelling is not painful, but increases slowly in size, being oval with flattened sides, and causes a dragging sensation. The veins of the scrotum and sper- matic cord enlarge. The tumor is smooth on the surface, and softer in some parts than in others, where the cysts approach the surface and give a sense of fluctuation. Testicular sensation disappears as the disease advances. Sir A. Cooper inclined to the belief that the cysts were due to enlarged and obstructed seminiferous tubes, and proposed to call it the “ tubular disease” of the testis. The greater part of the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, distended by the growth of the tumor, becomes obliterated by adhesions, while the unobliterated portion may contain hydrocele fluid. The tumor is composed almost exclusively of tough-walled cysts, joined into a compound, elastic VOL. vi.—40

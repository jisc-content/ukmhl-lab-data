1114 APPENDIX. total of 4 square feet in each of the 6 openings for 24 beds. These may be partially closed by hinged flaps in winter, and left open in summer, the foul air passing into a long, narrow, ventilating chamber in the ridge, and thence out through ventilators by a process of natural ventilation. In place of such a chamber, a duct, increasing in size as it takes in the air from each ventilator, may lead to an aspirating chimney, as in the wards of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. (See Fig. 1515.) This aspirating shaft is octagonal, 4 feet 8 inches in diameter, and 60 feet high above the level of the ward floor; it is heated by a coil of pipes placed above the level of the roof-ridge. Similar extraction- shafts, smaller in size, are provided for service-rooms and separation-rooms. Additional ventilation is obtained through gratings under each bed, and ducts leading diagonally into an iron channel under the basement ceiling. This channel extends along the axis of the ward, and opens into the aspiration shaft below the floor level. Fig. 1525. Fig. 1526. Barnes Hospital; plan of basement and principal floor. In Fi^s. 1525 and 1526, are shown the basement and first-floor plans of the administration-building and of one ward for 12 beds of the Barnes Hospital.

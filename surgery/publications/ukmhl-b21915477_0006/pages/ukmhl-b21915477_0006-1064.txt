1004 ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY. Club-Foot. The term club-foot was at first applied to only one form of distortion of the foot, but it now includes several affections which present marked differences of character; for these affections Dr. Little suggested that the generic term talipes should be employed, and this nomenclature is now universally adopted, the deformities being classified in four groups under the names of talipes equinus, talipes calcaneus, talipes varus, and talipes valgus. The characteristic features of each of these varieties of deformity are well defined, and clearly distinguish the different groups; thus, the subject of dis- tortion being in the erect position in talipes equinus, the forepart only of the foot touches the ground, the heel being raised and not used in progression ; in talipes calcaneus the front of the foot is raised'and the heel only affords support; in talipes varus the outer border of the foot is on the ground, and the inner border is turned upwards and inwards; in talipes valgus the outer border is raised, and the inner side of the foot is depressed. A verbal descrip- tion of these four conditions of talipes indicates that the first two, equinus and calcaneus, present opposite points of deformity, and that the last two, varus and valgus, differ in the same manner; this is to some extent true, but beyond the fact that the shape of the foot assumed in the respective con- ditions of equinus and varus, is so far different from that obtaining in cal- caneus and valgus, that in the former cases the part of the foot which touches the ground is in the latter the part which is raised, and vice versa, the various deformities possess no other points for comparison, and each must be considered as a separate subject and be studied independently. A further elaboration of the grouping of the various forms of talipes has also been adopted by classifying certain combinations of these deformities which not unfrequently occur; thus there are described talipes equino-varus and equino- valgus, calcaneo-varus and calcaneo-valgus-—distinguishing titles which are justified by clinical facts; it will, however, he more convenient for descrip- tion to keep to the simple forms, and consider the different combinations according as the chief characteristic of distortion represents equinus, varus, calcaneus, or valgus. The development of club-foot depends upon numerous causes which differ considerably in their mode of action; certain of these productive influences may be exercised on the foetus, giving rise to one or other of the forms of talipes, and the etiology of congenital deformity will have to be considered when talipes varus, which is by far the most common variety of congenital club-foot, is described. The non-congenital or acquired forms of talipes almost invariably originate in disturbance of the nervous system, and in consequent excitation of muscular abnormality. When this muscular abnormality coexists with non-congenital club-foot, it presents itself under two conditions which differ widely from one another. In one state the muscles are tense, firm, and well developed,but they do not properly respond to nervous influence, and their action is therefore ill-regulated. In this condition of the muscles, which is called “spastic contraction,” the fibres have become permanently shortened and have lost the power of normal extension—a result which is generally due to their having been thrown into violent action through reflex irritation of the motor nerve-system in early life. The various affections which give rise to convulsions in early childhood, may, any one of them, leave this state of permanent muscular contraction; thus, the eruption of the teeth, intestinal irritation, due either to the presence of entozoa or to the administration of improper food, and exposure to cold, are all exciting causes of spastic contraction, while the same condition is also frequently developed in

URINARY CALCULUS. 204 may measure the grade of his own success in cutting for stone. The table includes 1827 cases furnished by a great number of operators:— From 1- 5 years . . 1 died out of (about) every 44 6-11 44 . 1 44 44 4 4 44 44 12-16 44 . 1 44 44 4 4 44 H u 17-20 44 . 1 44 44 44 44 7 u 21-20 44 . 1 44 44 4 4 44 8 u 30-38 44 . 1 44 44 44 44 101 u 39-48 44 . 1 44 44 4 4 44 6 4 4 49-58 . 1 44 4 4 4 4 44 43 1 4 44 59-70 . 1 44 44 4 4 44 3f 44 71-81 44 . 1 44 4 4 4 4 44 8* This shows that the safest time to cut for stoue is after babyhood and before puberty. Next in order comes the infant age—below 5. Puberty has a depressing influence. Mature manhood gives better results, and after sixty, about one patient in every three and a half dies if cut. Coulson’s1 table (in decades) of 2972 cases furnished by Castara, Smith, Crosse, Cheselden, Dupuytren, and South, gives a somewhat similar result. I liave arranged it so that it may he compared with Thompson’s:— From Age. 1-10 years . Death rate. Coulsou. . 1 to 13.08 Thompson. Death rate. 1 to about 18.91 44 11-20 44 . 1 44 10.28 1 44 44 8.25 44 21-30 44 . 1 44 6.61 1 44 44 4.00 44 31-40 44 . 1 44 5.83 1 44 44 10.50 44 41-50 44 . 1 44 4.50 1 44 44 6.00 44 51-60 44 . 1 44 3.65 1 44 44 4.75 44 61-70 44 . 1 44 3.23 1 44 44 3.75 44 71-80 44 . 1 4 fc 2.71 1 44 44 3.16 These figures are undoubtedly good standards to go by. Much better results with children have been achieved by individuals, and even in general hospitals. And much worse results are recorded of brilliant operators, but, in the main, the average of these figures has gone unchallenged. They relate to the lateral operation. The weight of the stone—other things being apparently equal—has a dis- tinct hearing on the mortality of lithotomy, as shown by the very interesting tables compiled by Gross2 from the 1327 cases of calculus tabulated by Crosse, of Norwich, and by Garden, of the Saharunpore Dispensary.

Statistics of these operations—other than the lateral—are of only secondary importance. The high operation is confessedly very fatal, although at present it is 1 Op. cit.. p. 523. 8 Practical Treatise on Diseases, Injuries, and Malformations of Urinary Bladder, etc., p. 278.

HYPERTROPHY OF THE PROSTATE. 381 In the last place I will mention certain changes which take place in the position of the prostatic opening into the bladder. These can be best studied by examining the aperture from the vesical aspect, as was done with the specimens which the following illustrations represent.1 Fig. 1294 represents the position of the normal internal meatus; Fig. 1295, the position of the Fig. 1295. Internal meatus in ordinary form of enlargement of third lobe of prostate. opening in the ordinary form of enlargement of the third lobe, where the prostatic urethra forms an inclined plane ascending backwards. Fig. 1296 Fig. 1296. Pedunculated hypertrophy of third lobe of prostate ; urethra opening on either side. represents a pedunculated condition of the hypertrophied third lobe, where the urethra opens on either side of its base. This is analogous to the chan- nels left for the passage of the urine in the lobulated form of enlargement. 1 I am indebted to my colleague, Mr. Mitchell Banks, for these drawings, which are taken from specimens in my collection, and from rough sketches of my own.

The medullary canal is in some cases obliterated by the separation of the fibres.”1 Figure 14612 represents a section of a femur from a case of osteitis deformans, of Paget. Is this not exactly what has been described here by Nelaton in speaking of osteomalacia? We cannot discuss this mode of filling up of the medullary canal, or affirm whether it is obliterated by tissue of new formation, or by separation of the lamellae of the compact tissue by interstitial medullization. However this may be, if what Nekton describes may be met with in the beginning, it is certain that, in the last stages of the disease, the medullary canal enlarges enormously, that all the bone-substance sometimes disappears, and that “ there remains of the bone nothing but a sort of thin external pellicle, analogous to the shell of an egg.” (Nelatom) The mass contained in the osteo-membranous sac which replaces the bone in the last stages, resembles a dregs-of-wine-colored jelly more than marrow ; it is a sort of fleshy parenchymatous substance which recalls to the observer the tissue of the liver, of the gums, of the brain-pulp, of the pulp of the spleen, etc. This diffluent material usually has scattered through it cysts, and little by little are filled with a sanious or reddish, sometimes colorless, liquid, “ showing all degrees of ecchymosis, sometimes gelatinous and even Fig. 1455.

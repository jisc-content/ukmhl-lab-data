Among all the instruments employed, my experience has led me to adopt the divulsor used as a forceps, for the reasons which I have already stated. But this instrument has not been commonly employed. Among those in ordinary use may be mentioned, as having re- ceived general sanction, the long urethral forceps (Fig. 1210), and the alligator Fig. 1216. Urethral forceps. forceps, straight and curved (Figs. 1217,1218). My experience with all these instruments is, that they pinch, scratch, and tear the urethra, and that it is. Fig. 1217.

A very ingenious instrument, and one which may serve when the foreign body is impacted far forward, is the articulated scoop of Leroy clbEtiolles. Fig. 1219 represents it-—open and shut.

Mathieu, of Paris, has devised an ingenious instrument for reducing urethral stone to fragments. Fig. 1221 shows it, closed for intro- duction, and at work. The mechanism is in the handle. The stone is caught in the hollow of the closed female blade. Then, by rotation, half the female

393 PROSTATIC CALCULUS. be mentioned one recorded by Dr. Barker, of Bedford, England,1 in which, the calculus weighed three ounces and a half, and consisted of twenty-nine pieces of a whitish color, and porcelainous lustre and hardness, closely soldered together and measuring nearly live inches in length. It was removed from a man twenty-nine years of age, who had suffered from incontinence of urine from his fourth year. A somewhat similar case is recorded by Mr. Benjamin Gooch, of Norwich.2 In some cases it has been observed that the several fragments composing the mass have been dove-tailed together with most remarkable accuracy. These concretions have occasionally made their escape from the prostate, and have been voided with the urine. Symptoms.—When small, these concretions seldom occasion any inconve- nience ; they have been frequently found after death in large numbers when previously there had been no reason to suppose that there was anything amiss with the prostate. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that their presence serves to explain the existence of irritability and pain about the neck of the bladder, which is otherwise unaccountable. In some instances they give rise to symptoms precisely similar to those occasioned by stone in the bladder. Under these circumstances, the presence of calculi within the limits of the prostate may be determined by the use of the sound combined with digital exploration from the rectum. When existing, as they often do, in Fig. 1300.

Digital examination of the pros- tate by the finger in the rectum, is a proceeding which must not be overlooked 1 Trans. Prov. Med. and Surg.

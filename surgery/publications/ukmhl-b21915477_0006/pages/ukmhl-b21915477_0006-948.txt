888 INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES. carried backwards. This deviation commenced while the patient still kept his bed, and it only became more pronounced when he began to walk. I give here two drawings which will enable us to interpret the preceding cut (Fig. 1433), which represents a patient who was under my care in 1868, and who recovered completely. Some time afterwards, in 1869, being in Berlin, I saw in Wilmsâ€™s collection two anatomical specimens, of which he was kind enough to permit me to make a sketch, and which illustrate exactly the same lesion. They were specimens coming from patients whose thighs he had amputated. The first (Fig. 1434) shows a curvature of the femur in the Fig. 1434. f, femur ; T, tibia; R, patella ; a, angle formed by the meeting of the portion of the bone a d, developed since the beginning of the osteitis, with the old diaphysis. The connecting cartilage has become more and more distant from the diaphysis as it has furnished new layers of boue. This new portion of bone became bent upon the old portion while it was still but slightly rigid, being drawn backward by the flexor muscles, b, perforation through which a sequestrum has escaped. lower juxta-epiphyseal region. The patient had had a juxta-epiphyseal oste- itis ending in necrosis. The sequestrum had protruded gradually through the opening b, and bad been extracted. Inflammation propagated to the knee-joint had necessitated amputation through the thigh. In this specimen,

URINARY CALCULUS. 264 at the angle of the instrument. The operation known by the name of Buchanan, of Glasgow, ancl favorably thought of in England, is performed with a rectangular staff inserted well into the bladder until the angle of the staff lies in the membranous urethra just in front of the apex of the prostate. Fig. 1246. Fig. 1247. Rectangular staff for lithotomy. The perineum is transfixed with a sharp-pointed bistoury, the groove of the staff struck at the angle, and the knife carried directly onward into the bladder. The result is a cut like that of the lateral operation with both in- ternal and external incisions of moderate size. Fig. 1248. Lithotomy scalpel. It is well to have among the lithotomy instruments an ordinary searcher, with which to explore the bladder through the wound for fragments or multiple calculi. The scalpel generally used"(Fig. 1248) is moderately bellied.

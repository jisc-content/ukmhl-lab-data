The whole success of the mechanical treatment of the case depends upon the skill with which the instrument is applied and used, and from a want of appreciation of this fact an imperfect result very frequently follows; it is quite remarkable how one can blunder in his first attempt to apply a Scarpa’s shoe, the trouble usually arising from not properly adjusting the shoe according to the condition of deformity, and from fastening first the wrong parts of the instrument. If the former of these errors is committed, the heel of the foot does not properly fall into the heel-piece of the shoe; having overcome this fault, the course above described of commencing by •fastening the heel, then the calf-plate, and finally fixing the forepart of the foot, should always be followed ; by so doing the part of the appliance which is kept immovable during this stage of treatment is first made firm, and then the acting portion of the appliance is put ready for use. For the first twenty-four hours, the limb is merely kept resting in its original state of deformity ; the instrument is then taken off, and the foot and leg are examined to see if too much pressure has been exercised at any one spot from over- tightening of the straps; a fresh bandage is applied, and the instrument replaced, the front of the foot being raised upwards as much as can be com- fortably borne by the patient. The elevation of the displaced structures is daily carried on by the mechanical extension thus exercised; no attempt must be made to force the foot into shape by bringing into play the full power of the instrument; if such a strain is put upon the foot as to give rise to swelling or pain, the pressure must be immediately relaxed, as otherwise the skin will be excoriated by the tightened straps, and the only remedy will be to give up treatment until the abraded surface is again sound. It may be accepted as a golden rule in the mechanical treatment of this and all other varieties of deformity, that the instrument in use should be applied firmly but should never be tightly fastened. The reduction of the deformity of the foot in a case such as is now being considered, will take from two to three months to complete, and when the contraction of the plantar surface has heen overcome, the restoration of free movement at the ankle-joint must be proceeded with. At this stage of treatment is presented the first difficulty in deciding upon what measures are the best to adopt; as to the necessity for operative treatment in the first stage, no room for doubt exists, but whether or not it is .desirable to resort to tenotomy for the restoration of free movement at the ankle, is a more open question. The obstruction here depends upon shorten- ing of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, with contraction of the Achilles tendon, and also upon stiffening of the joint from want of use. The first of these causes arises from acquired, as distinct from active contraction; that is to say, the muscles and tendon have become shortened, not from any change in their normal properties, but from being placed in a condition which has prohibited their healthy action. Upon this arises the difficulty of selecting what course of treatment to pursue, whether to relieve the contrac- tion by section of the Achilles tendon, or whether to rely upon a constant application of mechanical extension, combined with physiological measures, to overcome the shortening of the muscles. The limb must be examined to ascertain to what extent the contraction of the Achilles tendon prevents the movement of flexion in the joint; if the case is one of long standing, and the foot cannot be brought to a right angle with the leg when the limb is straight, and the patient is also unable^when standing up to flex the leg further on the foot without raising the heel, it is necessary to resort to

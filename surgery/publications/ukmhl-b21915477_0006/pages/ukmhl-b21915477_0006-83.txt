31 DILATATION AND SACCULATION OF THE (ESOPHAGUS. seat of the dilatation is where the oesophagus is crossed by the left bronchus ;* hut when not due to stricture its seat is usually just above the diaphragm. The poucli-like dilatation, diverticulum, or sacculation, is most frequently a pharyn- geal diverticulum reaching down behind the oesophagus (pressure diverticulum, Zenker and Ziemssen). These cases cannot be very rare, although some forty only appear to be on record,1 2 for several have been seen in my own practice. The formations appear to be single only, as a rule.3 They are usually located posteriorly, sometimes in the median line, sometimes on one side of it. They are attributed to pressure from above, due to retention of food which Fig. 1177. ' Fig. 1178. Traction diverticulum.

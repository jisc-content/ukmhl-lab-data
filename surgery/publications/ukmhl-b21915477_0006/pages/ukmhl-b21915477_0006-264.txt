URINARY CALCULUS. 208 cases collected by Guersant, 6 terminated fatally, and 62 operations upon children in the Moscow Clinique furnished also 6 deaths—a very bad show- ing for calculus in the child. Gross’s table relates to the old operation, and the figures have at best a very vague significance, for all ages are included, and the cases were often selected. The fact of selection has greatly enhanced the apparent value of lithotrity. Thus Keith and Fergusson in 231 cases of lithotrity lost 21, a death-rate of 1 in 11.55, while out of 296 lithotomies, the same surgeons lost 75, or 1 in 3.94. Again, Gross has compared the results published at date of the lithotrities of Thompson, Brodie, Fergusson, and Keith—637 cases in adult males, with 46 deaths, 1 in 13.84—with the results of lateral lithotomy by various surgeons taken from Thompson’s table and covering the same period of life, 723 cases with a death-rate of 1 in 4.82. While selection of cases may here be accredited with a measure of the success, still the showing is admirable for the old operation of lithotrity in adults. Coming down to special statistics, Fergusson lost 1 in 9.08; Brodie 1 in 12.77; Heurteloup claimed to have lost only 3 out 69 cases—1 in 23—and he operated at a single sitting Keith1 21 in 18.42. C-iviale’s well-known statistics claimed a mortality of only 1 in 41.50. But it is well known that he aban- doned the operation in ten patients who died, and these, being added, bring his mortality up to 1 in 24, a result certainly good enough to be satisfied, with. But the Keeker Hospital statistics of Civiale, are those upon which most reliance can be placed, since they were kept by individuals unfriendly to the great lithotritist; and these give3 for 78 cases 5 deaths, a rate of 1 in 15.60. Thompson’s4 latest figures are 422 lithotrities with a death-rate of 1 in 13; Cadge5 reports 86 lithotrities with a death-rate of 1 in 10.75. Ivanchich,6 in Germany, has done very well for the old operation. Out of 300 cases of short sittings, under ether when necessary, he lost in the first hundred 14, in the second hundred 5, in the third hundred 3—in all 22, or about 7 per cent, —the last hundred giving the best showing ever made for old-fashioned lithotrity. The present showing of litholapaxy is better than this. The operation is in full course of experiment all over the world, and no figures now given will be accurate a few years hence. Some efforts have been made to collect material from which to general- ize:— Bigelow’s announcement of the method appeared in January, 1878.7 Up to Feb. 15r 1880, I had collected8 120 cases at the hands of all operators, with G deaths, a mortality of 1 in 20. In November, 1880, the number had only reached 162.9 Of these, 125 had been operated upon by surgeons who had recorded five or more operations, and might be presumed to be fairly skilful in vesical surgery. The mortality was 5—1 in 25. The remaining 37 operations had been done by surgeons having recorded less than five cases, and among these there were six deaths—1 in 6.16. Gross,10 in 1882, reported for all operators 312, with 17 deaths—1 in 18.35. Guyon’s collection of 590 operations gives 36 deaths 1 in 13.61. (Desnos.) Bigelow’s personal statistics up to July, 1884, Fnclude 77 cases, of which five were fatal—1 in 15.4, about 6 per cent.

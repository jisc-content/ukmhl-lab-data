URINARY CALCULUS. 210 admirable showing. P. J. Freyer,1 an East Indian surgeon, reports 111 cases and 4 deaths, 1 in 27.75—a mortality of less than 4 per cent—which places him at the head of the list of successful operators who have had over 50 cases. The two operations have been compared on four occasions. The Vienna General Hospital for the year 1881 reported :— Lithotrity 14 cases ...... 1 death Litholapaxy 22 “ . . . . . . 0 u Thompson, in the sixth edition of his Diseases of the Urinary Organs, reports 112 consecutive cases of rapid lithotrity performed upon elderly men averaging over 62-| years, with 3 deaths, 1 in 37.33. He says that by the old operation his mortality was 7.50 per cent., or 1 in 13.33, and that in his best series of 112 cases he had 6 deaths. In the hands of this able operator, therefore, the new operation has yielded results exactly twice as good as those obtained by the old method. Billroth,2 3 in a paper read before the Vienna Medical Society in 1880, speaks of 41 patients operated upon by himself by old lithotrity; of these, 9 died, seven after the first sitting, two after the second. He had done litholapaxy 7 times with one death, which he ascribed to poisoning by chlorate of potassium. The patient had taken G20 to 700 grains a day. Guyon, reporting through E. Desnos8 in a thesis referred to in the Revue de Chirurgie, says that he has practised old-fashioned lithotrity in 73 cases, with G deaths, 1 in 12.16; as already mentioned, his modern operations have been 296 in number, with 14 deaths, 1 in 21.14. Relapse after Radical Treatment. The question of the number of cases of relapse occurring after radical treatment, deserves consideration in connection with other statistical argu- ments bearing upon a choice of the method of cure. Mr. Charles Williams, of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, has studied this subject very thoroughly. His latest utterance appeared in 1878,4 and may be taken to represent the state of the case now, as far as concerns old-fashioned lithotrity and lithotomy. The question of relapse after litholapaxy has not yet been made the subject of generalization. Mr. Williams says that during a period of 97 years, in 935 lithotomies (lateral and median), relapse occurred once in every 33 cases. The recurring stone was not always of the same composition as the calculus which had been removed by the first operation. In 19 instances the second stone was like the first—10 phosphatic, 9 uric- acid and urate. In 7, phosphates followed urates; in 2, phosphates fol- lowed oxalates. This seems to show that there were only 9 cases of true re- lapse of acid primary stone, for a reproduction of phosphates is simply the return of a physical symptom of a morbid condition (chronic catarrhal inflam- mation), and as that morbid condition is not necessarily removed by the operation, so the recurring stone may be a relapse not in any possible way dependent on the character of the operation. Where secondary follows pri- mary stone, it is fair to believe that the operation may be at fault in having lighted up a catarrhal inflammation which has become chronic, or in having left a fragment behind. A new nucleus also, in any case, may come down from the kidney after the operation. From the records of the Charite Hospital, in Paris, it appears that the pro- 1 Lancet, February 28, 1885, p. 378. 2 Wiener med.

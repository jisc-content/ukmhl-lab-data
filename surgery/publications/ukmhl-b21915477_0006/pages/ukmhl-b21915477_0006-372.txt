When seized, the stone is to be dealt with according to the particular method which has been decided upon. If it is contained within a litholabe, the stone is broken with blows from a hammer, of sufficient force and quick- ness to crush it without injuring the instrument.1 If with the rack and pinion lithotrite, the penis is held in the same manner, and the handle, which is sometimes on the right side, sometimes on the left, is worked by the right or left hand, the penis and contained instrument being held by the other. As the rack-and-pinion instrument cannot be worked without more or less movement of its point within the bladder, it is objectionable. The same objection applies with equal force to the lever instrument (Fig. 1277), which requires too much movement of the right hand. I have discarded both for Fig. 1277. the, to my mind, more satisfactory lithotrite of Civiale, which may be easily worked, with or without the screw, this being released or attached by turn- Civiale’s lithotrite. ing what instrument-makers call the revolving cap. Weiss’s lithotrite has all the advantages of Civiale’s, and also an additional merit. The screw power is in connection with the male blade, and is more readily released, this being accomplished by placing the thumb of either hand upon a button on the "handle, the movement being effected in a line with the shaft of the instrument. But the cylindrical" form of the handle, added by Thompson, though admitting of greater force in the hands ot the operator, does not per- mit the same delicacy in manipulation as does Civiale’s round-headed instru- 1 I mention this method, though now obsolete.

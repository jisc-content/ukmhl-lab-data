INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITALS. 746 emerges at a suitable distance from the margin of the other side; a stitch is then passed from one to the other labium, passing at its middle through the crest of the rectocele. The sutures may be of silkworm-gut, and secured by conqjressed shot; Emmet, however, prefers silver wire. Median Colporraphy.’—In this operation the vagina is narrowed by attaching a part of the anterior to a part of the posterior wall; the vagina is thus partially made double. Hegar credits Spiegelberg with having first done this operation ; he sutured the lowest points of the anterior to the upper part of the posterior wall. Le Fort subsequently adopted a similar method. Le JFort’s Operation.—This is the method usually followed, and it consists in denuding in the median line upon the anterior, and then upon the pos- terior wall of the vagina—vagina and uterus both being prolapsed—a sur- face two centimetres broad by four or five in length, and then, after reducing the displacement, in stitching the two surfaces together. If silver wire is used the ends should be left long, so that they may be removed by moderate traction after the surfaces have firmly united; they are generally loosened from the tenth to the twentieth day. The use of catgut is proposed by Eustache. The accompanying illustration (Fig. 1423) shows the denuded surfaces, one of the sutures having been introduced. Colpo-perineorraphy.—This operation not merely lessens the calibre of the vagina, but also lessens the vulvar opening—prolonging the perineum so as to prevent vaginal and uterine prolapse. Fig. 1423.

In the posterior colporraphy of Schroeder, it is readily seen by the illus- tration that the perineum is involved as well as the posterior vaginal wall,

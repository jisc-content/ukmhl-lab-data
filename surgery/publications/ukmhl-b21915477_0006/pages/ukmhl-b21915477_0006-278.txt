222 URINARY CALCULUS. very important. Any good operator can do excellent work with any reason- ably good instrument, but no instrument, however good, can be counted upon to perform a good operation unless a good hand is behind it, and, better still, a hand more or less trained to this special work. I shall describe oidy the lithotrites of Thompson and Bigelow, and the instruments which I habitually use. Thompson uses two instruments, one fenestrated to do the heavier work, the other non-fenestrated for ordinary crushing. He employs two varieties of fenestrated lithotrite, that shown in Fig. 1204 being the old-fashioned one, and obviously far less powerful than its younger rival (Fig. 1205), in which the male blade passes entirely through the female. He uses also two forms of non-fenestrated lithotrite. Fig. 1206 shows that used in intermediate work, with reasonably large and hard frag- ments. Its male bladfe is narrow and slightly wedged in shape. That seen in Fig. 1207, with its broad, flat male blade is for final pulverization of the frag- Fig. 1206. Fig. 1207. ments. The toughest steel, cut, not forged, is used in the manufacture of all these instruments. Fig. 1208. Thompson’s lithotrite, female hlade Fig. 1210. Handle of Thompson’s lithotrite.

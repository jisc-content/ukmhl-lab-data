INFLUENCE OF OSSEOUS INFLAMMATIONS ON THE GROWTH OF BONES. 885 In regard to the seat of osteitis, an analysis of the cases gathered in my service at the IIotel-Dieu gives the following figures for the large bones of the limbs:— ( Upper third . -j Middle third.

That it should appear in my statistics, is explained by the fact that for three years my service did not include women. I should think it to be really ab'out 1 to 3. At any rate, osteitis is much more common in males than in females. Osseous inflammations produce disturbances in the growth of hones not oidy by exaggerating or repressing their development,"but also by causing curvatures, deviations, and flexions, which may be very annoying from a functional, and moreover very disfiguring from an {esthetic point of view. Juxta-epiphyseal osteitis causes loosening of the diaphysis, which leaves for a while a little mobility between the diaphysis and the epiphysis. At a certain time there is at this point a sort of articulation, an amphiarthrosis,

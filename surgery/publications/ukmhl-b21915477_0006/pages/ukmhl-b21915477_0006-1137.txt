1077 LATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE. able to resist the effects of any amount of strain that may be put upon their spinal columns, yet become seriously deformed. In the first case, although the column is constantly kept in a state of curvature during the daytime, the flexibility and elasticity of the spine are such that it recovers during rest, and does not become permanently altered in shape; in the second case, although only subjected to the normal amount of bending, it is, from defective condition of its most important qualities as a weight-bearing column, unable to regain its natural shape, and thus gradually becomes permanently curved. The cause of the peculiar method of displacement which characterizes lateral curvature, the so-called rotation of the vertebrae, is probably due to the anatomical construction of the spine. The anterior portion of the column —the bodies of the vertebrae—is not provided with much lateral support; whilst its posterior portion—the arches of the vertebrae—is stayed up by numerous muscles and bands of fascia. The anterior portion, being that part of the spine which fulfils the duty of a weight-bearing column, is also especially liable to be affected by the exciting causes of lateral curvature; it is moreover largely constructed of fibrous tissue, and it is not therefore surpris- ing that it should first be deflected from the median line. The varying ex- tent to which rotation occurs in the different parts of the column, is also to be explained by the construction of the intervertebral bodies: it has already been noticed that excess of displacement of the anterior portion of the column over the posterior, is much more marked in the lumbar region than in the dorsal; in the former situation, the relative thickness of the interver- tebral disks is much greater, whence the tendency to rotation; also the lateral support which the posterior parts of the lumbar vertebrae derive from the muscles and fasciae, tends to contribute to their stability. The term rotation of the vertebrae does not accurately define the real nature of the distortion, which consists really of a general twisting of the column at the seat of cur- vature, and not of rotation of the individual vertebrae upon their axes. Treatment of Lateral Curvature.—The various methods which have been employed to restore the scoliosed spine to its normal shape, may be classified in two divisions—the physiological and the mechanical. The former of these consists chiefly in the use of different exercises, so designed as to bring into action the muscles of the trunk on the concave side of the curve, and thus to draw the spine towards the mesial line; a mode of treatment which is adopted by those who consider that irregular muscular action is the pro- ducing cause of the deformity. Mechanical treatment has been applied in many ways, all of which are modifications of one of two different plans for bringing mechanical force to act upon the column in order to reduce the deformity. Of these two mechanical methods, one consists in the application of pressure whilst the subject is in the horizontal position, a couch with adjustable levers and movable pads being the instrument usually employed ; the other method requires the use of an appliance fixed to the body, and so constructed as to admit of pressure being brought to bear upon the spine at the seats of curvature. The above measures of treatment, have each their separate advocates, each plan has received enthusiastic support as well as severe condemnation, and here again the want of unanimity may be ascribed to an absence of agreement amongst authorities upon what does and what does not constitute lateral curvature; thus, it is not uncommon to find a case of lateral bending of the spine, which has been successfully relieved by a certain mode of treatment, described as one of lateral curvature—a mis- take which is naturally productive of confusiomin any discussion which may ensue as to the value of the measures of treatment employed. In endeavor- ing to decide upon the best plan to adopt for the reduction 'of lateral devi-

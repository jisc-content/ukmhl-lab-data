URINARY CALCULUS. 286 extent deemed sufficient for the extraction of the stone. An effort is usually made, by varying the direction of the handle during this manoeuvre of with- drawing the blade of the knife, to pass beneath and around the bulb, the Wood’s bisector. Staff for median lithotomy. handle of the knife pointing nearly directly downwards while the membran- ous urethra is being incised, after which it is swept sharply around, looking nearly upwards as the incision in the raphe is being completed. Many surgeons prefer to reach the membranous urethra in a different manner, as follows: With the left index and thumb on either side of the raphe, stretching the skin, the surgeon commences his incision with a big- bellied scalpel upon the raphe at about one and one-half inches in front of the anus, and cuts directly downwards to within one-third of an inch of the latter. The skin, cellular tissue, and superficial perineal fascia are divided until the operator comes upon the raphe uniting the lateral halves of the accelerator urinse muscle. Following this backwards, the fibres of the sphinc- ter ani are encountered, and may be distinguished by the fact that they are not possessed of any median raphe. These are cut transversely, and the bulb, now exposed, is turned upwards out of harm’s way. This method is particu- larly suitable to the case of old men, in whom the bulb, much enlarged, sags

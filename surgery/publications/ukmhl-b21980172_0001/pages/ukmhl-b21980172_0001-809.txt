In 1906, Chiene of Edinburgh introduced stovaine into this country and used it in combination with hemisine, the solution being that of Tuffier—viz. a 10 per cent, solution in sodium chloride.

') • In 1907 the experiments of Barker, wlio.se original paper should be studied,^ were responsible for the progress wliich has been recorded by British surgeons. This surgeon substituted glucose for the sodium cliloridc of Bier and Chaput, with the object of obtaining a solution slightly heavier than the cerebro-spinal fluid, and one which would be less ha;molytic and more nearly isotonic with that fluid.

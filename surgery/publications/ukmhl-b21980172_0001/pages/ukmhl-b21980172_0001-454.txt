TUMOURS 376 the name " secondary malignant nem'oma " (Fig. 52). The maUgnant cliange manifests itself clinically by the rapid enlargement of one of the nerve tumours, which may have remained stationary for years. The resulting sarcoma shows a considerable degree of local malig- nancy, and sarcomatous tumours may also develop on other nerves. Treatment.—A simple fibro- ma of a nerve trunk may some- times be removed without inter- rupting the continuity of the nerve. If removal of part of the nerve is unavoidable, an attempt must be made to repair it by one of the well-known methods. A painful subcutaneous tuber- cle should certainly be removed. In most of the varieties of general neuro-fibromatosis surgical treatment is not called for. Re- moval by dissection of plexiform neuro-fibroma and some forms of elephantiasis may be practicable. Elephantiasis neuromatosa affect- ing a limb has been successfully treated by amputation. Operation may be urgently called for when the sarcomatous change supervenes in cases of neuro-fibromatosis. Fibrous tumours of the bones are rare, and there is no doubt that the majority of tu- mours growing from the peri- osteum, and to the naked eye presenting the characters of a pure fibroma, prove on both his- tological and clinical grounds to Fig. 51.—Elephantiasis neuromatosa, be fibro-sarcomas, usually of the small spindle-cell form. Perhaps the most important examples of fibrous tumour of the bones are those of the jaws and the so-called naso-pharyngeal fibrous polypus, which is a fibroma growing from the muco-periosteum covering the A'ault of the pharynx. The simplest fibrous tumour of the jaws occurs on the gums, and is known as the simple or fibrous epulis. The tumour originates in [Aficr Alexis Thomson^ On Neuroma and Nciif-o-Filn'oiuatosis.'")

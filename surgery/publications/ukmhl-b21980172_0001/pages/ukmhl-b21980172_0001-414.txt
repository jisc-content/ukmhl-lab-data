336 CONSTITUTIONAL DISTURBANCES either the donor shows signs of acute anaemia or the recipient is judged to have received sufficient blood ; an average time is about twenty minutes. Crile claims that the blood pressure can be more certainly- raised by direct transfusion than by saline infusion, and that it is maintained for a longer period, as the blood does not so rapidly pass out of the vessels as in the case of infused saline fluid. Crile's experiments appear to support his view, which he has put to the test of clinical treatment with good results ; but the method is not without danger both to the donor and to the recipient. Practic- ally, the only danger to the donor is loss of blood, and the amount can Fig. 39.—Riva-Rocci apparatus for measuring the blood pressure. be easily regulated, whilst recovery from anaemia in a young healthy adult is rapid and perfect. The principal dangers to the recipient are acute dilatation of the heart, haemolysis, and the contraction of disease from an unhealthy donor. Eigors during or after transfusion are common, but rarely dangerous ; they may also occur after saline infusion. Direct transfusion of blood has undoubtedly a place m tne treat- ment of severe shock, in spite of its obvious difficulties and disadvan- tages, but further investigation and experiment are needed before its correct position can be assigned to it.

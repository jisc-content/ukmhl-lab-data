567 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST \ processes of the tumour often extend. A marked feature of this form of carcinoma is its tendency to shrink and thus exert traction on the surrounding tissues. This is often seen, in such a section as is being described, by its effects on the nipple, the skin and the pectoral fascia and muscle. Unless the tumour is situated j^erijiherally, some of the larger ducts will be seen in the section passing between the growth and the nipple, and by traction on tliese the nipple is gradually draAvn inwards towards the tumour so that eventually it may be deeply retracted be- neath the level of the skin (Plate 33). Simi- larly, the fibrous bands (suspensory ligaments) which pass through the subcutaneous fat from the breast to the skin are drawn upon by the shrinking tumour, so that at first the skin is loosely held to the sur- face of the latter, whilst later it becomes per- manently dimpled or puckered, and fuially adherent to the growth beneath it (Plate 33). Examination of the deep surface of the tumour will frequently show that the fascia covering this aspect of the breast is adherent to the growth, and at a later stage the superficial fibres of the pec- toral muscle are adherent, or even drawn into its substance (Plate 33). Tliis adhesion of the tumour to the fascia and muscle is recog- nized clinically by the diminished mobility of the breast caused by voluntary contraction of the muscle. Another striking result of the shrinkage caused by a hard carcinoma in the substance of the is that the whole gland often becomes less pendulous and the occupies a higher position than the opposite one (Fig. 1.56).

CARCINOMA 561 Carcinoma of the breast—Although squamous-celled carci- noma occasionally arises in the cutaneous covering of the breast and columnar carcinoma may originate in the ducts, the ordinary form of cancer of the breast is the carcinoma simplex. It is unnecessary to describe the general histological character of the tumour, which has largely served as the basis for the description of carcinoma simplex (p. 514). It is, however, necessary to mention that in their minute .. . ^. V / Fig. 151.—Microscopic section of carcinoma simplex of breast (hard variety). structure tumours of the same macroscopic appearance may diiler widely. The differences depend chiefly upon the extent to which the proliferating epithelium retains any resemblance to an acinous arrangement. Usually all such resemblance is lost, and the cancer cells are arranged in irregular solid columns and masses (Figs. 127, 128, 151, and 152). Not uncommonly, however, a distinctly acinous type is retained, and the sjjheroidal cells are arranged in such a way as to enclose a central lumen (Fig. 153). Such an arrangement is, however, often only present in some areas, whilst elsewhere the characteristic structure is observed. We do not, therefore, think tha,t any useful purpose is served by applpng special names

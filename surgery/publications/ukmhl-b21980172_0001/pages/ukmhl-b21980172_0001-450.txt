372 TUMOURS nerve shows, however, that the tumour is not the only manifestation of the disease, for the adjacent parts exhibit cyhndrical enlargement, or very frequently the part of the nerve from which the tumour arises is the seat of fusiform swellings due to diffuse overgrowth of the endo- neurium. In moUuscum fibrosum soft fibrous tumours of the skin, usually multiple, are present (Fig. 47). They :v ^ vary much in size, are often pedunculated, and are covered with thin smooth skin. The tu- mours consist of soft connective tissue which often extends deeply beneath the skin from the projecting tumour. It is sometimes possible to feel small convoluted cords in their substance, and the microscope shows that the fibrous overgrowth involves the cutaneous nerve fila- ments, whilst any other changes present appear mM ^® secondary to this. ;_JL - ^^ar Plexiform neuro- aS -^^fW -fibroma is defined by ' ■ Alexis Thomson as " a fibromatosis confined to, and at the same time diffused throughout, the distribution of one or more contiguous nerves, or of a plexus of nerves." By dissection it can be shown that the tumour consists of numbers of convoluted cords held together by loose connective tissue. These cords consist of the thickened nerves, which may be cylin- drical, fusiform, or beaded (Fig. 48). Plexiform neuro-fibroma is most common in the head and neck in the areas of distribution of the fifth and the superficial cervical nerves, and is much less common on the trunk and limbs, thus agreeing with the form of elephan- Fig. 47.—Molluscum fibrosum. Multiple cutaneous tumours resulting from neuro- fibromatosis are present. There is a patch of pigmentation on the forearm. (/. F. Payne, Trans. Clin. Soc, vol. xxii.)

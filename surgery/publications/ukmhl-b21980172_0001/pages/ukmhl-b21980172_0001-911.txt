775 SALVARSAN IN THE TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS By T. W. GIBBARD, M.B.Durh., M.R.C.S.Eng., Major R.A.M.C. AND LAWRENCE W. HARRISON, M.B.Glasg., Major R.A.M.C. Characters of salvarsan. —■ The hydrochloride of dioxydi- amiiloarsonobenzol, kiiowu as salvarsan, or as 606,"" is a cauary- yellow powder having the formula Cj2Hi2N202^®''(HCl)o, so that it contains about 34 per cent, of arsenic. It is soluble in Avater, in which it forms an acid solution. The addition of an alkali to this solution causes, first, the formation of a flocculent precipitate, and then a clear alkahne solution as more alkali is added. Being readily oxidizable to a highly toxic compound, it is kept jJreserved from contact Avitli air in sealed glass capsules, and for the same reason it is necessary to see before using it that the capsule is intact and the colour of the powder as described, while it should be injected as soon as possible after exposure to air Effects of salvarsan. — Its administration to syphiHtic patients iu any of the ways described later is practically always followed by a rapid and strildng disappearance of all clinical signs of the disease. Primary lesions heal in an average of eleven days, the induration almost always being less at the end of twenty-four hours. Secondary rashes disappear in from five to nine days ; while mucous patches, condylomata, and superficial ulcers of the throat, such as occur in the so-called secondary stage of the disease, heal not less quickly. It is chiefly, however, in those manifestations which are most serious to the patient that its effects are most marked, such as gum- matous iritis, arthritis, periostitis, gummas of the viscera, and especially tertiary sj^hilitic ulceration, as well as syphilitic disease of the central nervous system. Especially gratifpng is the relief of pain which foUows its use in severe tertiary ulceration of the throat and in bone syphilis ; in almost all these cases the patient's misery is reheved

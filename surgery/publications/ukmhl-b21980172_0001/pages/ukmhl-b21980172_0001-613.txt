RODENT CARCINOMA 531 cases have been recorded. The tumours are usually situated at the side of the neck, beneath the sterno-mastoid, and intimately connected with the large vessels ; the cysts may have a rugose or even papillary inner surface, and present the characters of a tumour developing in a cyst rather than of a cystic change in an originally solid tumour. It thus seems very probable that this form of deeply seated cystic carcinoma arises, as suggested hy Volkmann, in remnants of a branchial cleft (branchiogenctic carcinoma). Rodent carcinoma is a striking instance of a tumour which, although undoubtedly a malignant growth, manifests its malignancy only l,>y its slowly progressive destruction of the surrounding tissues, and in its Fig. 138.â€”Microscopic section of rodent carcinoma, more highly magnified to show the characters of the epitheUal cells. most typical form presents the features of an ulcer without any definite clinical evidence of the new growth which the microscope reveals in its base and edges. The histological structure of the tumour is best studied in sections of the small, hard papule which usually represents the earliest stage of the disease. If such a section be examined micro- scopically a very well-marked epithelial new growth is found beneath the epidermal layer of the slcin, which, although much thinned, is continuous over the new growth (Fig. 137). The growth consists of large and often very irregular masses of epithelial cells, those lying next tlie stroma forming a single layer of columnar cells, while the remaining cells are small and elongated or irregular in shape (Fig. 138). The cells sliow no tendency to undergo the horny change met with

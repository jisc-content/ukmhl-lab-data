viii PREFACE co-editor, Professor Beattie, who is editorially responsible for the Pathology in the work, and whose name appears in the list of contributors. I must also express my in- debtedness to the contributors to the work for their invaluable co-operation, and for the ready consideration they have given to every suggestion. The great majority of the plates and figures in the text are reproductions of original drawings and photographs. Authors and publishers who have kindly allowed illus- trations to be copied will, I hope, find the source of such illustrations duly acknowledged in the inscriptions. C. C. Choyce.

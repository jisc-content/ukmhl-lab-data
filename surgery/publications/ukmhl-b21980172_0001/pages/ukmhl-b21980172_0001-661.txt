577 CARCINOMA OF THE UTERUS Carcinoma of the vaginal portion occurs either as an ulcer or as a warty growth ; as it increases it tends to spread around the cervix, causing a considerable mass, and extending to the vaginal fornix rather than into the cervical canal. Thence it may spread to the base of the broad ligaments, and to the iliac and sacral glands. Carcinoma of the canal of the cervix may for a considerable time remain confined to the interior, and the os show little change, although Fig. 160.â€”Microscopic section of columnar-celled carcinoma of cervix of uterus (malignant adenoma). {I 'roin ,1 oisr itndL'r the care of II.

The growth is more malignant than cancer of the vaginal portion, and shows a greater tendency to cause metastases, especially in the lungs, viscera, and bones. A carcinoma of the vaginal portion usually presents itself in its earliest stage as an induration of one lip of the os wth a warty or superficially ulcerated surface, whilst in a growth beginning in the 2 L

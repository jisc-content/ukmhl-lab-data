GANGRENE 210 dimmish the dangers of putrefaction and septic absorption, the separa- tion of the dead from the living must be assisted, or amputation must be resorted to. The question of amputation, and the site at which it shall be performed, will depend upon the cause of the gangrene, the rapidity of its progress, the symptoms which accompany it, and the general condition of the patient. General constitutional treatment must be carried out; the patient's strength must be supported by stimulants and suitable nourishment, the excretions must be regulated, pain must be relieved and sleep encouraged. When an operation is necessary, the method of inducing anaes- thesia requires careful consideration. In many instances, owing to the feebleness of the patient or the condition of his lungs, a general anaesthetic is unsuitable ; in such cases, spinal anaesthesia, or Bier's method of " anaesthesia by venous infiltration," should be employed. The latter method, which has much in its favour, is carried out in the manner described by another writer (see under Treatment of Suppuration, p. 191). CLASSIFICATION It is imijossible to draw up an accurate classification of gan- grene, owing to frequent interaction of the various causes, but the one now given, though admittedly imperfect, is based on a com- bination of clinical and pathological grounds and includes all the important varieties. I. Gangrene due to circulatory disturbances. 1. Impairment of the general circulation. 2. Embolism. 3. Thrombosis. 4. Ligation of vessels. 5. Injury of vessels (indirect traumatic gangrene). 6. Pressure on vessels. 7. Disease and degeneration of vessels (senile gangrene). 8. Spasm of arterioles : Rajmaud's disease. Ergotism. II. Gangrene due to defective innervation. 1. Trophic ulcers. 2. Certain forms of bed-sore. III. Gangrene due to injury. Direct traumatic gangrene.

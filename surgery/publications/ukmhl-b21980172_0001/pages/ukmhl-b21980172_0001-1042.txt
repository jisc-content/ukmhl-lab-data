904 DISEASES DUE TO ANIMAL PARASITES much general infiltration. In the colon particularly the papillomas may separate off at their base and form ulcers not unlike those of dysentery (Fig. 245). Localized bilharziosis may also occur in the large intestine, especially in the sigmoid, with enormous thickening of all the coats of the gut, a luxuriant papillomatous growth almost occluding its lumen, and a firm fibro-cellular induration in the meso- colon. Hard, movable swellings are produced with the usual intestinal symptoms. The symptoms of intestinal bilharziosis are those of gastro- enteritis, and, later, of irregular dysenteric diarrhoea with the pass- age of large masses of mucus and blood. The amount of blood, and its admixture with mu- cus, vary considerably. Bilharzia ova, with ter- minal spines, are found in the faeces. Treatment is symptomatic, and in the main follows that usually adopted for dysentery. For the localized masses ex- ploratory laparotomy is indicated, with inci- sion into the gut at the site of the swelling; the gut and the abdo- minal wounds are then sutured. Great relief of symptoms, with disappearance of the tumour, generally follows. In the rectum the principal features of the disease are multiple papillomas, often in large masses, with or without protrusion (Fig. 246) ; infiltration and softening of mucous membrane, with or without prolapse ; ulcerations, old or recent; fistulse ruxming into the ischio- rectal fossa or out on to the buttocks or sacral region ; and, at the anus, hard fibrous encircling masses tunnelled with epithelium-lined tracks.

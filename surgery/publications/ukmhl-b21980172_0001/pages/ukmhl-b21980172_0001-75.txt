WiDAL Reaction The phenomenon of agglutination, or the aggregation of bacteria in suspension into clumps under the action of specific antibodies called agglu- tinins, has already been discussed in connexion with the subject of immunity. It may be watched under the microscope in a hanging-drop, and in bacterial suspensions its occurrence leads to a striking alteration in the naked-eye ajipearance of the fluids concerned. This consists in a gradual change from uniform turbidity to a granular condition of the fluid, and terminates under suitable conditions in the " sedimentation " or settling out of the bacterial clumps. The reaction as used clinically for tlie diagnosis of typhoid infection is spoken of as Widal's reaction, and when employed for this purpose, or for the differentiation of B. typhosus. B. â– pavatypliosus. B. coli. and allied forms, is still commonly carried out by the microscopic method. This must, there- fore, be described at the outset. But it must be clearly stated that the only 1 HCl-alcohol with a little picric acid added. " " Lugor.s iodine " : iodine 1 grm., potassium iodide 2 grm., distilled water 300 c.c.

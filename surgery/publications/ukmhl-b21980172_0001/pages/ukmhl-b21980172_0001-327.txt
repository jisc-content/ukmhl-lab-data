STERILIZATION BY MOIST HEAT better, in a 1 per cent, solution of sodium bicarbonate or sodium biborate, is the method usually applied to instruments. Soda or borax not only prevents the tarnishing of the steel caused by boiling in plain water, but also raises the boiling-point of the fluid to 104° C. It is essential that the instruments should be completely covered with the solution, and that the lid be kept on the pot or sterilizer in order to prevent excessive loss of heat by evajioration from the surface. Fig. 14.—Low-pressure steam sterilizer—live steam. Even sharp instruments may be boiled if their edges be carefully protected with lint or cotton-wool. Undoubtedly, however, frequent boilings do impair their temper, and therefore many surgeons content themselves with immersion of knives in spirit or pure carbolic for half an hour or more.

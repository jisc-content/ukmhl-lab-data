6i8 EXAMINATION OF CEREBRO-SPINAL FLUID point of diagnostic value is the finding of the Trypanosoma Gamhiense in the fluid. Serum reaction—The cerebro-spinal fluid has been used for the Wassermann reaction in cases of syphilitic origin. There is much evidence of its great value in determining the cause of some nervous diseases whose etiology has been up to the present time very doubtful. It is claimed that in definite syphilitic cases a positive reaction can be obtained, but too great stress cannot at present be laid on the value of the Wassermann reaction as an absolute diagnostic test for syphilis. Lumbar puncture.—This is a very simple operation, and one attended with practically no risk of damaging the spinal cord, as the point of puncture is below the actual limit of the cord and the fibres of the Cauda equina are sufficiently movable to escape the needle. It is well to keep the patient in bed for at least twenty-four hours fol- lowing the puncture, so that the pressure in the cerebro-spinal cavity may become equalized. The patient is placed on the left side near the edge of the bed, the knees flexed upon the abdomen, and the site of puncture prepared as for any surgical operation. The needle used should be fairly strong and from 5-10 cm. long. The site of puncture should be at the lower border of the third lumbar vertebra, and usually slightly to one side of the middle line, or just immediately above a line joining the highest points of the two iliac crests. The needle is directed slightly upwards and inwards until the dural sac is reached, when the cerebro-spinal fluid should flow freely and, if under pressure, with considerable force. No aspiration should be used at any time. The needle must be pushed in with sufficient force to penetrate the muscles, etc., and it is therefore most important that care should be exercised lest the needle suddenly strike the vertebra and break.

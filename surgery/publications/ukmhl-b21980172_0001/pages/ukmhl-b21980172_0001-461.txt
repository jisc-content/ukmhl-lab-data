383 GLIOMA CHONDROMA exhibits no tendency to involve the overlying cerebral membranes. The chief changes occurring in gliomas are fatty degeneration with softening or cyst formation, and haemorrhages, which may be small and scattered, or so extensive as to resemble an apoplectic extravasation. The glioma usually occurs as a solitary tumour. As already stated, it is difficult to draw a sharp line between tlie glioma and certain tumours of the brain evidently of a malignant nature (glio-sareoma). The Fig. 55.—-01101113 of brain, showing branching cells and a delicate reticulum. latter may extend beyond the brain to the membranes and skull, and ' give rise to metastases. The so-called glioma of tlie retina will be described among sar comas (p. •■3f2). CHONDROMA A chondroma is a tumour which in its structure corresponds more or less closely with that of normal cartilage, the latter being much more commonly of the hyaline than of the fibro-cartilaginous type (Fig. 56). Certain cartilaginous new formations are met with which do not partake of the nature of tumours. For instance, the irregular outgrowths which occur at the margins of the articular car- tilages, especially in connexion with rheumatoid arthritis, are clearly

595 DERMOID CYSTS sweat-glands, may be present (Fig. 165). In dermoid cysts occurring in teratomas, which have already been described, other structures such as teeth, nails, and more complex parts may be present. Tlie contents of a dermoid cyst vary, but most commonly consist of the sebaceous material secreted by the sebaceous glands in its wall, and thus resemble the contents of a sebaceous cyst, often with fine hairs projecting from the wall. If, however, no sebaceous glands are present, the cyst may contain a clear or opalescent fluid and be translucent. Fig. 165.-—Microscopic section of wall of dermoid cyst, showing the stratified epithelial lining and sebaceous glands. Dermoid cysts of the head and neck,—The most common situation for dermoids is tlie jacr, the exact position being usually determined by the lines of luiiou of the various processes from wliich the part is developed. They thus occur in the fissure between the maxillary process and the frontal region of the cranium with its central fronto-nasal process, and also in the fissure between tlie maxillary and mandibular processes. A dermoid arising in the first of these fissures may be situated at the outer angle of the orbit, less commonly at the inner angle, and still less commonly in the naso-facial sulcus, whilst a dermoid arising in the cleft between the maxillary and mandibular processes is situated on the cheek in a line drawn from the external auditory meatus to the angle of tlie mouth.

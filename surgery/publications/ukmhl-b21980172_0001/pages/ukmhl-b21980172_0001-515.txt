435 ADENOMA undoubtedly contain an adenoma and a cartinoina, even in immediate apposition, but there is no evidence that the one has arisen from the otlier. Adenoma of the thyroid may in its structure resemble the developing or fully developed gland, and occurs as an encapsuled tumour over which the adjacent jjart of the gland is often stretched as a thin layer. An adenoma having the structure of the developing gland is character- ized by the absence of colloid material, and on section pre- sents a homogeneous sub- stance of a whitish colour. The foetal gland consists of anastomosing solid cylinders of cells lying in a vascular connective tissue, and, simi- larly, a section of this form of adenoma j^rcsents the ap- pearance of alveoli filled with spheroidal cells and separated by connective tissue with large, thin-walled capillaries (Fig. 95). Berry states that he has never removed an adenoma of this kind larger than an orange. An adenoma having a structure like that of the fully developed gland consists of spaces lined with a low cu- bical epithelium and filled with colloid substance. The spaces are usually larger than in the normal gland, and to the naked eye, or with very slight magnification, the tumour pre- sents a fine mesliwork, the spaces of which are filled with vellowish-brown substance.

In this variety of thyroid adenoma gross cystic changes are common, and thus by the coalescence of adjacent spaces even a large

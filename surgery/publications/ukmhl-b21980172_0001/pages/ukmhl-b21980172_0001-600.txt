TUMOURS 5i8 of a carcinoma simplex that the presence here and there of some more specialized cells gives a valuable clue to the nature of the epithelium in which it originated. Still more specialized forms of carcinoma are also met with in which the normal characters of the cells, functional as well as morpho- logical, are strikingly preserved. For instance, in one form of cancer of the thyroid the tumour cells closely resemble those of the normal Fig. 131.â€”Microscopic section of columnar-celled carcinoma of sigmoid colon. The distinction between the normal glands and the alveoli of the tumour is well marked. gland, secreting colloid substance, and even serving a useful purpose in metabolism, as shown by a case of von Eiselsberg's, quoted by von Bergmann. In this case the symptoms of post-operative myxoedema, following the removal of a cancerous thyroid, subsided as a secondary tumour developed in the sternum, and the subsequent removal of the secondary growth was followed by tetany and death. Further evidences of the fact that cancer cells may retain some degree of the function of their normal epithelial antecedents is afforded by the presence of mucus- containing goblet cells in columnar-celled carcinomas, and the demon-

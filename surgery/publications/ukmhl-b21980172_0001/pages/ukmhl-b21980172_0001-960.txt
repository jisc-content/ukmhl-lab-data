GONORRHCEA 824 tube. In Valentine's (Fig. 209) the source of light is a minute incan- descent lamp mounted on a rigid metal wire, which is passed down the tube, and so directly illuminates the portion of membrane under observation. Fig. 209.—Valentine's endoscope. In the normal condition, except during micturition, the walls of the urethra are in contact, lying in longitudinal folds. The passing of the urethroscope separates the walls ; but as it is being withdrawn they fall together again, at a short distance from the end of the tube, in the form of a funnel, the folds radiating from a central point, which has much the appearance of a sphincter, and is called the central figure " (Fig. 210). In the normal condition of the prostatic urethra the mucous mem- brane is smooth and of deep-red colour. As the tube is withdrawn, the mucous membrane becomes paler, and a rounded prominence appears at the lower edge of the tube ; this prominence represents the caput gallinaginis (Figs. 211, 212). As the tube is still further Fig. -210. Fig. 211. Fig. 212. Fig. 2IO.—Membranous portion of normal urethra, as seen through the endoscope, showing small round central figure with numerous fine radiating folds. Fig. 211.—Normal prostatic urethra, showing the anterior portion of the caput gallinaginis. Fig. 212.—Normal prostatic urethra, showing the caput gallinaginis. withdrawn the caput disappears from view, and the membranous portion is inspected. This is generally paler in colour than the pros- tatic, and the central figure is more regular. In the bulbous part the folds of mucous membrane are larger, and the central figure appears as a vertical fissure (Fig. 213), and at times the openings of Cowper's

417 ENDOTHELIOMA being merely tubular clefts surrounded by flattened cells (Fig. 76), whilst if the lining cells assume a spheroidal or polygonal form the resemblance to a glandular structure may be very close (Fig. 77) ; and it is interesting to note that certain tumours, such as those of the sahvary glands, wliich are now generally regarded as endotheliomas, were at one time described as adenomas. By a further prolifera- tion of the cells a plexiform arrangement of threads of cells may be produced (Fig. 78), or large irregular cell-masses may result, in Fig. 76.â€”Microscopic section of endothelioma (parotid tumour). the centre of which the lumen persists merely in the form of a slit- like cleft. Lastly, the cell growth may result in the formation of solid cell masses and strands in which all evidence of a central lumen is lost, and in which the true nature of the tumour is only evidenced by the continuity that can be traced between the solid cell masses and others in which a lumen is present (Fig. 79). In the variety of endothelioma known as perithelioma the cell masses may in parts be seen to be definitely related to vessels, around which they are radially arranged, and from these cell masses slender, solid columns or threads of cells may extend into and form a network in the surrounding connective tissue. The stroma of endotheliomas varies much in both character and amount. It may be composed of dense fibrous tissue, or of soft, riclily 2b

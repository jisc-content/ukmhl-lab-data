788 CONGENITAL SYPHILIS By J. E. R. McDONAGH, F.R.C.S. Definition.—Syphilis derived from iiitra-uterine infection of the embryo with the syphihtic virus. General remarks.—The result of the infection is to bring about an abortion, miscarriage, or still-birth, or the birth, before or at full time, of a live child showing signs of the disease either at birth or at some subsequent period. Congenital syphilis resembles the acquired form, the chief differ- ence being that it is a general infection from the beginning, while the acquired variety commences with a local lesion or chancre. It is a very much more serious form of the disease than the acquired. In the former the tissues affected are undeveloped, and therefore fall a more easy prey to the poison, the mortality being high, while death as the result of acquired syphilis is the exception. In the severer form death takes place in utero, and the macerated foetus is expelled two or three weeks later. A family history of such an abortion occurring in each successive pregnancy is characteristic of syphilis, but habitual abortion within the first four months of pregnancy of a non-macerated foetus is not proof (or evidence) of syphilis. Frequently after a series of abortions a seven or eight months' child is born alive. Premature labours likewise not uncommonly run in succession, until, finally, a full-term, and possibly non-syphilitic, child is born. Many syphilitic children, though born alive, die a few hours or days after birth, section usually showing marked syphilitic changes in the internal organs. Such children come into the world thin and marasmic, with dry, lax and wrinkled skin, an old and haggard facial expression, and a weak and scarcely audible voice. Arrest of development may occur at any period of extra-uterine life ; growth is stunted ; there is lateness in dentition, speech, and walking ; fre- quently there is deficiency of intelligence, and also a delay in the changes of puberty.

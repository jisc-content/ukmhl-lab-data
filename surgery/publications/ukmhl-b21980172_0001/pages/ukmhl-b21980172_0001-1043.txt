905 BILHARZIOSIS Prominent masses may be ligatured off, the sphincter being- stretched if necessary ; nlcerated surfaces may be cauterized, or various astringents applied ; while the fibrous masses may be completely removed with the lower end of the rectum. Rarely, a diffuse papillomatous condition is found in the perineum and around the anus. Sometimes epithelioma may develop on an old ulceration at the anus.

A bilharzial haemoptysis is sometimes seen. Deposits appear in subcutaneous tissues, and may not infrequently be completely ex- cised, as in the penis and perineum, or subsequently scraped and cauterized when ulceration has supervened. A bilharzial cirrhosis of the liver is occasionally met with, and nodules on the surface of the spleen and on the parietal peritoneum. Ova may also be found in enlarged mesenteric glands.

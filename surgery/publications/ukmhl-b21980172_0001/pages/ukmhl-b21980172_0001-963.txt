CHRONIC URETHRITIS 827 hold the walls of the canal apart, and so permit of an extensive view. The appearance of the urethra (Figs. 216, 217), as seen by this instru- ment, is strikingly different from that obtained by the ordinary ure- throscope, for not only does the mucous membrane look strangely pale and anaemic, but the fonn and character of the lumen appear markedly different. This is especially evident in the posterior urethra, where, Fig. 21G. Fig. 217. Orifice of the normal bladder and colliciilus seniinalis as shown by CJoldschniidt's urethroscope. it seems to me, the great value of the instrument will be found. One sees the colliculus seminalis and the openings of the prostatic and ejaculatory ducts with a clearness and vividness which, to those only accustomed to the imperfect and distorted view obtainable by the older form of instrument, is nothing short of startling. Whilst watching the colliculus, not infrequently one may observe the ejaculation of the Fig. 218. Fig. 219.

On introducing the instrument a little farther, the orifice of the bladder can be seen and examined in a way which hitherto has been possible neither by the cystoscope nor by the uretln-oscope (Figs. 218, 219). Here, again, the instrument is

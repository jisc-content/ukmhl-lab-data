TUMOURS 488 from melanotic tumours it has sometimes been noticed that the urine becomes dark after exposure to the air, as the result of the oxidation of a substance known as melanogen. The true nature of melanin is uncertain, and whilst by some authorities it is supposed to be a derivative of the blood-colouring matter, it is thought by others to be a special product of the cell protoplasm. The pigment is certainly quite distinct from the ordinary forms of blood pigment resulting from haemorrhage into the substance of a sarcoma or myeloma. In many melanotic sarcomas the cells vary in shape, oval cells or <2> Q " '-^^^ ^ ooo &a^ „ - Fig. 115.—Microscopic section of melanotic sarcoma of skin, showing cells distended with pigment granules. short spindles usually predominating (Fig. 115). In another form, especially that beginning in the sldn, the cells are large and rounded or polygonal, and tend to assume a more or less markedly alveolar arrangement. This arrangement suggests that the cells are either endothelial or epithelial in origin, or, in other words, that the tumour is either an endothelial (or alveolar) sarcoma or a carcinoma. Upon this and other considerations has arisen much discussion as to the true nature of melanotic malignant growths, and, whilst they were formerly classed among the sarcomas, the view is now rather widely held, following Unna and others, that they are really melanotic carcinomas. In the skin, tumours of this class not uncommonly arise in pigmented moles, and thus the question of their nature is closely

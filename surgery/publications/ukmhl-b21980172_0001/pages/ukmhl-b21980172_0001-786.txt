666 GENERAL ANAESTHESIA must be turned off again very thorouglily to prevent loss of the gas by leakage. When given pure, nitrous-oxide affords an ansesthesia of about half a minute. Its full anaesthetic effect is accompanied by spasmodic obstruction in the upper air-passages, cyanosis, clonic and sometimes tonic muscular contractions. By the use with nitrous- oxide of air, or of oxygen, these phenomena, which ne- cessitate the removal of the anaesthetic, may be postponed or greatly diminished, and hence a longer inhalation of nitrous-oxide is rendered pos- sible. A proportionately longer anaesthesia is thus obtained. The combination of oxygen with nitrous - oxide requires special apparatus and con- siderable practice to ensure good results. Its advantage over that of air and nitrous- oxide skilfully employed is not sufficient to recommend it, except to the expert who has much practice and to whom the additional apparatus is not a formidable obstacle. The apparatus (Fig. 184) for giving nitrous-oxide, pure or with air, consists of two side-valve cylinders, c, c, each yielding 25 gallons, with stand, double union, and foot-key. For hospital work cylinders of 50 or 100 gallons are generally used. These are joined by an india-rubber tube to an india- rubber bag capable of holding Fig. 184.-Apparatus for administration - to 3 gallons of the gas. of nitrous-oxide gas. This bag connects with the face-piece by Hewitt's valved stopcock. The cylinders are not to be used alternately, but the foot- key is kept on one, and this is used till it is exhausted. The other is then brought into use, and the empty cylinder replaced by a full one. The full cylinder should be tested by weight before being used, to see

47 THE OPSONIC INDEX in tubes 1, 2, and 3. In tubes 4, 5, and 6 haemolysis should be complete, or at any rate marked ; in tubes 7, 8, and 9 it should be absent, or markedly reduced.

Ill f.C. * The fraction V, t?-, etc., means that the fluid in question lias jireviously been diluted to one-fifth, one twenty-fifth, etc., with nonual .saline solution. Determination of the Opsonic Index In this determination the serum of the patient is compared with the serum of a healthy individual, or, better', with a "pooled"' serum from a number of healthy persons, as regards its power of jjreijaring the bacteria in a given bacterial emulsion, for phagocytosis by normal washed leucocytes. 1. Preparation of normal leucocytes.—About cc. of blood is taken from the observer's finger into about 3 c.c. of a 1 '5 per cent, solution of sodium citrate in 0'85 per cent, sodium chloride solution, the tube being gently shaken as the blood drops into it, to ensure thorough mixing and prevent coagulation. The mixture is then centrifugalized, and the supernatant tiuid removed and replaced by normal salt solution. The blood corpuscles are then shaken up again, again centrifugalized, and the overlying fluid care- fully removed. The upper layer of the corpuscles, which contains the greater number of the leucocytes, is now pipetted off into small tubes and set aside for use. 2. Preparation of serums.—Blood is taken into a Wright's blood- capsule or other suitable small tube to the amount of about i c.c. It is allowed to clot, and the vessel is tlien placed in a centrifuge, and the serum

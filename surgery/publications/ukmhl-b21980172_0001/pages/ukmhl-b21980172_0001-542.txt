460 TUMOURS retrogressive changes (Fig. 110). First, the protoplasm disappeared, only the nuclei remaining, and finally a completely organized thrombus was left in which no traces of the cancer cells could be seen. Schmidt further states that the cancer i0 u cells in the arteries of the lungs may extend continuously along the lumen into the capillaries and veins without invading the vessel walls. This occurred in 9 of the 1.5 cases, and serves as an explanation of the presence of metastases in the systemic circulation without their pre- sence in the lungs. Another point of interest which has been brought forward by recent research in connexion with the metastases of carcinoma is the relation of the vascular endothelium to the growth of secondary deposits. It is said that an embolus of cancer cells undergoes little or no prolifera- tion whilst the endothelium re- mains intact; and that the blood-plasma exerts no destruc- tive action on the cells, which may remain quiescent for an indefinite period within the ves- sel. As soon, however, as the endothelium is destroyed, a stroma reaction takes place.

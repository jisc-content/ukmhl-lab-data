CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 573 cases may form a prominent elevation of the skin of a slightly bluish tint, and somewhat resembling a cyst. The secondary growths may or may not present a similar degeneration. Altliough the malignancy of a carcinoma is probably diminished by colloid changes in the cancer cells, the removal of the disease should be canied out on the same lines as those adopted in the ordinary forms of the disease. We have our- selves seen a case in which a t}'pical colloid carcinoma of the breast was associated with a widespread invasion of the surrounding lymphatics with undegenerated cancer cells. Kelly and D'Este Emery have Fig. 158.â€”Microscopic section of colloid carcinoma of breast. The alveoli are occupied partly by colloid material and partly by the undegenerated remains of the cancer cells. recorded a very remarkable case of carcnioma of the breast in which certain local recurrent growths and metastases exhibited advanced colloid degeneration. The primary tumour Avas regarded as a simple duct papilloma (Univ. Coll. Hosp. Mus., No. 2311), but subsequent examination revealed the presence of a t}q)ical spheroidal-celled growth in the tissue aromid the cyst. Recurrent growths which were removed six and seven years after the first operation presented marked colloid change. Death occurred seven and a half years after the removal of the primary tumour, and secondary deposits were found in the sternum, skull, lungs, and liver. In the lungs and the sternum the groAvths were colloid, but m the skull and the liver the deposit presented the

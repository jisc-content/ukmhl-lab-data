TREATMENT OF SHOCK 335 but because the blood cannot get from the big venous trunks into the right side of the heart, and as a consequence the arteries are empty. The injection of saline fluid into the already over-distended venous system will stUl further embarrass the circulation, and the consequent exudation will add to the oedema of the sm'roundiiig tissue, and no good, but only harm, will result, for the arteries will remain as empty as before. There can be little doubt that, in many cases of shock, patients who would otherwise have recovered have been Idlled by the further embarrassment of the circulation caused by a sudden large in- jection of saline fluid. The heart and tissues have been drowned. (8) Direct trans- fusion of blood.—In cases of shock asso- ciated with loss of fluid from the vascular system the only rational treatment is to supply the fluid, and, unlike saline injection, that fluid must remaua in the blood-vessels. An attemj^t to supply the necessary fluid has been made by direct transfu- sion of blood. Trans- fusion of blood, as is remarked in the section on Ha?morrhage, has been practised for centimes in a crude way for the relief of disease and loss of blood, with little value and much danger, but recently it has been revised and placed on a more scientific basis. This revival is largely due to the investigations of Crile on the treatment of shock and the experiments of Cassel on vascular anastomosis. The method of transfusion is to unite directly the radial artery of the donor witli the median basilic vein of the recipient, either by direct suture or hy means of a special cannula, and to allow the blood to transfuse until Fig. 38.—Apparatus for intravenous infusion of saline.

385 CHONDROMA OF BONE often very lobulated ia oiitliae. Its consistence is firm, but mucli less hard and resistant than that of bone, and often the tumour gives on examination an almost elastic sensation to the fingers. On section a chondroma is seen to be composed of lobules of cartilage held together by septa of fibrous tissue. The cartilage has a uniform, bluish-grey, almost translucent appearance like ground glass, but is often modified by one or another of the secondary changes in its substance to be described below. As cartilaginous tumoui's differ considerably in their mode of gro\\'th according to the position which they occupy, it will be convenient to describe separately some of the most important varieties. '* \ 1. Cartilaginous tu- mours are very common in 1^;; the bo)ies, especially the long l)ones, of young sub- -M''- jects, and arise very con- J-m stantly in close proximity to the epiphysial cartilage, ^s'' | 1 ,: being in the case of the #• •' ' long bones almost invari- ably attached to the ex- ? ' f ; ^ tremity of the diaphysis. 1^ ^ Such tumours, on account ^ of tlieir tendency to ossify, „ -* ' are known as ossifying i \^ '^^^ chondfoinas, and will be . ^ ■ ' considered more fully, "'■'■■f'|..,*-'* : under the osteomas, as can- "^SjM*. cellous exostoses (p. 391). Cartilaginous tumours pig. 57.—Chondroma of lower extremity originating in the extre- of femur, in section, mity of the diaphysis of a growing bone do not, however, always exhibit this tendency to early ossification. In the Museum of University College Hospital is a specimen of a cartilaginous tumour growing centrally in the lower end of the femur and projecting anteriorly and posteriorly through openings in the compact tissue (Fig. 57). In parts the tumour is cystic, and the microscope shows that in some places the softer lobes of the tumour consist of pure myxomatous tissue. The patient from whom the tumour was removed was a woman aged 20. Eggshell-crackling coidd be obtained in the enlarged lower end of the femur, and before operation the tumour was thought to be a myeloma. Nearly four years after amputation was performed the patient was in good health z

400 TUMOURS MYELOMA A myeloma is a tumour which in its structure corresponds more or less closely with that of red bone-marrow. Structure.—Examined microscopically, the most striking feature of the tumour is the presence of numerous large multinucleated cells —myeloplaxes (Fig. 67). These cells are usually rounded or oval in Fig. 67.—Microscopic section of a myeloma. shape, with a regular outline, and the nuclei, often twelve or more in number, are arranged centrally or irregularly throughout the proto- plasm. Between the giant cells is a cellular tissue, the cells of which are small and mostly oval in shape and lie in a finely fibrillated stroma. The blood-vessels are very numerous. A myeloma on section presents a homogeneous appearance and has a characteristic dark-red or maroon colour (Plate 31). It has a pecuhar consistence, and its friability has been compared with that of the Hver. The colour of the tumour is often modified by changes in the blood extravasations which are common in its substance, so that mixed with the dark-red tissue are often seen areas of a dark chocolate-brown tint. As a further result of extravasation, degenerative changes are common in the tumour, and cysts frequently form, sometimes so extensively as to obscure the true nature of the growth. It was formerly customary to include the myelomas among the sarcomas as the giant-celled variety, or myeloid sarcoma. The course of the disease, however, fully justifies the view that a myeloma is a benign growth, showing no tendency to cause deposits in the lymphatic

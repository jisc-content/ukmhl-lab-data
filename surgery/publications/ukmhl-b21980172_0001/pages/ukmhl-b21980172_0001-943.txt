THE COMPRESSOR URETHR.E So; It is true that under an aiifcstlietic, or by the adoption of certain measures which will be referred to later, it is possible to fill the bladder by injecting fluid into the meatus. But this in no wise contradicts the cstabUshed fact that fluids injected with an ordinary gonorrhceal syringe do not usually pass beyond the bulbous urethra. Fig. 203.â€”The male urethra and adjacent parts. r, Bladder; 2, prostate gland; 3, internal vesical or prostatic sphincter; 4, external vesical or prostatic sphincter ; 5, ejaciilatory duct ; 6, seminal vesicle ; 7, compressor urethras muscle surrounding membranous urethra ; 8, bulb of the corpus spongiosimi; 9, corpus cavernosum ; 10, glans penis; ii, fossa na\'icularis ; 12, sphincter ani. Now, just as the compressor muscle prevents the passage of fluids to the bladder, so it prevents fluids from passing the opposite way, viz. from the bladder to the meatus. Therefore, if pus or blood be present in the urethra behind the compressor muscle, the fluid will tend to pass backwards into the bladder rather than forwards towards the meatus. Tliis sharp separation of the urethra into an anterior and posterior portion by the compressor muscle is of the greatest importance for the

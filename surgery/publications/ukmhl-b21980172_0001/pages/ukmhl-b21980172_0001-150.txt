APPLIED BACTERIOLOGY io8 improved, either remains stationary or, as more commonly happens, actually progresses at a more rapid rate than before. New Tuberculin (T.R.) should be employed, that prepared from human strains of B. tuberculosis for all ordinary cases, but that prepared from bovine sources should be used in cases complicated with phthisis. Some of these latter do fairly well with Calmette's Tuberculin (CL.). The dose of tubercuUn varies somewhat with the age of the patient. A small child would receive perhaps O'OOOl or even O'OOOOo mg., while a fairly well nourished adult would commence with 0'0002 or O'OOOl mg. The treat- ment of tuberculosis of the kidney must be started with very small doses, O'OOOOS mg., proceeding as the patient improves to O'OOOl, 0"0002, and 0'0004 mg. The intervals between doses of tuberculin, if the opsonic index is not available as a guide, should be 10-14 days. When a dose of 0 000.5 is reached, an interval of 16-18 days will generally meet the case. Where the index is not estimated, the weighing- machine is the. most important indication as to the correctness or otherwise of the dose and interval. Tuberculous patients doing well under tuberculin gradually and steadily increase in weight, and any error in dosage is promptly followed by a fall in body weight.

A SYSTEM OF SURGERY SURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY By GEORGES DREYER, M.A.Oxon., M.D. AND E. W. AINLEY WALKER, M.A., D.M.OxoN. L INTRODUCTORY The importance of applied Ijacteriology for modern surgery cannot easily be overestimated. For, besides its obvious and now well-recog- nized relation to surgical cleanliness in the management of woimds, it often proves itself of the utmost value in prognosis, it not infrequently affords very great assistance in the treatment of infective processes, and it is essential in establishing a certain diagnosis in many otherwise doubtful cases. The surgeon cannot be too careful to take every advantage which bacteriology affords of acquainting himself with the precise character of every infection lie is called upon to treat ; nor can he be too well informed as to the nature and tlie mode of action of the micro-organisms with wliich the tissues of his patient have to deal. Tlie methods of bacteriology are in general extremely simple, and all the information required can in very many cases be both easily and quickly obtained. A microscope, some slides, one or two stains, and a few culture-tubes should be as much a part of the surgeon's arsenal as a catheter or a scalpel. Even where the opinion of an expert bacteriologist is found to be desirable, a microscope-preparation and a culture made at once on opening an abscess, for example, will enable him to give much more certain and reliable information to the surgeon than is likely to be obtained by any examination of the same material after the la.pse of perhaps hours, or, it may be, a wliole day.

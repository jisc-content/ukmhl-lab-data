TUMOURS 4o6 microscopically it is found to consist of closely packed capillary vessels which, on account of their irregular arrangement, are divided in various directions. The endothelium cells are often arranged in several layers, and thus the lumen mR,y be very small, and the close approximation of the vessels may give a very cellular appearance to the section (Fig. 71). In other cases the capillary vessels are separated by more Fig. 71.â€”Microscopic section of a capillary angioma, showing capillary blood-vessels, the swollen endothelium of which gives them in some parts a gland-like appearance. abundant connective tissue, often containing fat cells, and in the skin the capillary network passes irregularly among the sweat- and sebaceous glands and hair-follicles. The capillaries not infrequently present small saccular dilatations. Capillary angiomas are most common in the skin, and are popularly known as " mother's marks," or, according to their appearance, as " strawberry marks," etc. They are usually present at birth, but often spread from a minute red spot to cover large surfaces. In its most usual form a cutaneous nsevus forms a bright-red, sharply defined patch without obvious elevation of the surface, but at other times the affected part of the skin presents a somewhat velvety surface, or may be raised in the form of a soft nodular or warty growth

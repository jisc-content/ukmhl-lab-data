BILHARZIOSIS may be involved. Infiltration of mucous membrane, followed by ulceration, with de&truction of portions of the urethra and the form- ation of fistula?, is the usual result. The fistula; arise mainly fi'om tlie membranous portion of the urethra, and often leave the canal later- ally or even above, and run between the corpus spongiosum and the corpus cavernosum of one side, to reach the surface of the perineum, buttocks, pubes, or abdomen. In both single and nuiltiple fistula? there is much surrounding fibrous tissue and often a hard oedema—false elephantiasis— throughout the scrotum, peri- neal tissues, or penis (Fig. 243). The penile urethra, when attacked, sometimes presents extraordinary deformities pro- duced by fistulfe and oedema, and may exude a thick, blood- stained purulent discharge from tlie meatus. In extreme cases the whole length of the erectile tissue may be solid with indu- ration, and a permanent fixed erection follow. The resultant painful and difficult micturi- tion, if combined with destruc- tive processes in the bladder, causes intense sufi'ering.

Lymphangioplasty may also be tried in suitable cases. Ulceration of the glans penis may complicate the condition, and even end in epithelioma. BILHARZIOSIS OF THE INTESTINE Billiarzial lesions have been described from the stomach to the anus (Fig. 244). A diffuse papillomatous sowing may occur througliout the mucous membrane, anywhere from the ileum to the anus, with

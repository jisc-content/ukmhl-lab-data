237 DIABETIC GANGRENE possible, particular care being taken not to damage the flaps with the saw. The technique should be aseptic rather than antiseptic, for chemical substances that are strong enough to be germicidal are also strong enougli to kill the tissues. Ha?morrhage is best controlled by digital conipression of the main artery in order to avoid damage to the tissues by the tourniquet. If during section of the limb the small vessels do not bleed freely, the amputation should be performed imme- diately at a higher level. With regard to the site of amputation, most surgeons are now agreed that it is better to amputate above the knee and thereby secure primary union, than by section below tlie knee to obtain a longer stumi") in which suppuration or gangrene of the flaps is liable to occur.

394 TUMOURS cartilage. It is generally attached to the surface of a bone and, unlike the spongy exostosis, is sessile. ^ An ivory exostosis is most common on the vault of the skull, especially the parietal and frontal bones, where it forms a slowly growing, and usually small, sessile tumour of extreme hardness, over which the scalp moves freely. The tumour is usually single, but uot^very rarely two or more may be present. When quite small Ivory exostoses occasionally grow in the frontal and sphenoidal sinuses and ethmoidal cells, the tumour probably originating in the periosteum lining the cavity. When such a tumour occupies the frontal sinus the first symptoms are those of a slowly increasing dis- tension of the sinus, but later the tumour may project into the orbit, displacing the eye outwards, downwards, and slightly forwards. Speci- mens are in existence of enormous tumours of this nature, resembling large nodular masses of marble, and encroaching on the cranial cavity (Fig. 65). Ivory 'exostoses may not only extend into the orbit from the frontal sinus, but occasionally originate in that cavity, usually from the upper border. Bony tumours, sometimes reaching a large size, and of dense or cancellous structure, occasionally originate in the jaws. In the maxilla the tumour may originate on the external aspect of the bone or in Fig. 64.â€”Compact osteoma of tabular portion of occipital bone. [University College Hos/<ital Miisetnii.) it is usually hemi- spherical, but as it increases it tends to become conical or limpet - shaped (Fig. 64). Extremely dense osteomas have occa- sionally been met with on the inner aspect of the skull, and have necessitated operative interfer- ence on account of symptoms caused by pressure on the brain. As a rule, tumours in this situ- ation are more irre- gular in shape and less smooth on the surface than those of the external aspect of the skull.

515 CARCINOMA SIMPLEX or parts of tumours they are spheroidal, in others they lose their spheroidal shape, chiefly as the result of the pressure of adjacent cells one upon another, and become altogether irregular, flattened, or polyhedral (Fig. 128). The individual cells usually possess an abundant granular protoplasm, and a large round or oval nucleus, in which considerable variations in the amount of chromatin will often Fig. 128.â€”Microscopic section of carcinoma simplex, from the breast. ( High power.) be noticed. This form of cancer includes that usually known as glandular or spheroidal-celled carcinoma, but it is important to remember that every cancer, whatever be the nature of the ejyithelium in which it originated, may tend to assume this undifferentiated form. In contradistinction to this simple undifferentiated form of car- cinoma others must be recognized which retain, in the shape or arrange- ment of the cancer cells, some more or less striking feature of the specialized epithehum in which the tumour cells originated. Thus, in a carcinoma originating in a stratified epithelium the cells may retain the

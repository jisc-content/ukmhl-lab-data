TREATMENT OF ELECTRIC-CURRENT INJURIES 303 In the case of electric currents the cause of death may be heart- faikire or paralysis of the respiratory centres, depending on the kind of current involved. Respiratory paralysis is brought about by the action on the medulla of very high-tension currents, both direct and alternating, and may be successfully treated by artificial respiration, kept up, if need be, for hours, provided the heart's action be not impaired. Heart-failure results from lower voltage shocks, and is more likely to be caused by alternating currents of low than of high frequency. The musculature of the heart ceases to beat rhythmically, and is thrown into a state of fibrillary contraction. Once estabhshed, this condition always proves fatal, as no means have been devised for successfully combating it; though, experimentally, Prevost and BatelU restored the normal rhythm to a heart in fibrillation by applying to it a high-tension current before the blood-pressure had fallen to zero.

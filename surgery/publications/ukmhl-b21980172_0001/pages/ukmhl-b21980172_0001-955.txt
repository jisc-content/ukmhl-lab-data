TREATMENT OF ACUTE URETHRITIS 8iq described when speaking of acute anterior urethritis. As these fluids are non-irritating, they do not usually produce a powerful contraction of the compressor urethrfe muscle, and so are allowed to pass into the posterior urethra. The injection should ):)e retained in the urethra for fifteen minutes, so that the primary contraction of the compressor urethra? may relax and allow the fluid to pass backwards. The patient should be instructed to aid the pass- age of the fluid by relaxing as far as possible—that is to say, he should try to micturate while the injection is being made. The beneficial effect of the injections is generally quicldy seen. Within a few days the purulent secretion diminishes and becomes more mucoid in charracter. When this takes place and all painful symptoms are absent, the astringent reme- dies may be applied. But it is useless to order their injection with the ordinary gonorrha^al syringe ; the fluid would never pass the compressor urethra^, which is thrown into strong spasm by the irritating solution. This difficultjnnay be overcome by either of two methods—we may gradually increase the pressure of tlie fluid injected at the meatus until it is sufficient to overcome the spasm of tlie compressor urethra? (Janet's irrigation) ; or we may inject the fluid by some suitable in- strument, such as a catheter. Janefs irrUjatiov is carried out by means of an irrigator holding a pint or more of fluid, fitted with a couple of yards of tubing and a conical glass cannula. Fig. 205 shows Valentine's instrument for the purpose. The temperature of the irrigation fluid should in all cases be from 38° to 40° C.

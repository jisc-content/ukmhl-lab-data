762 ACQUIRED SYPHILIS to any great extent. A few neurotic patients complain of severe pain ; a few others of a slight, dull aching pain, with some stiffness, lasting for one or two days ; but the majority assert that pain is altogether absent or is insignificant. 2. Nodosities and abscesses.—These are things of the past, owing to improved technique. Although nodosities were fairly common in former years, I have seen them but rarely since using boiling oil for sterilizing needles and syringes. Abscesses are due entirely to faulty antiseptic detail. 3. Occurrences of embolism.—Although cases are reported from time to time, I have never seen one in my extensive experience of this method. Soluble and Insoluble Salts The intramuscular method involves either the frequent injection of soluble salts or the infrequent injection of insoluble salts. Soluble salts.—The method of frequent injection consists of a series of mercurial injections practised daily for five or six weeks. The preparations used for this purpose are nearly all soluble. The following are some of the formulae in which they are generally prescribed :— PercMoride 0/ Mercury Hydrarg. percliloridi . , , . . • gr. iii. AquiB ......... 5i. Dose: Tl\x for an injection. Hydrarg. perchloridi . . . . . . gr. x. Ammon. chloridi . . . . . . . gr. v. Aquse ......... 3i. Dose: n\x for an injection. Cyanide of Mercury Hydrarg. cyanidi . . . . . . . gr. i. Cocainse hydrocliloridi . . . . . . gr. i. Aquae destil. ....... 5X. Dose : Tllx for an injection. Peptonate of mercury is a solution in glycerine and water of a mixture of peptone, sublimate, and ammonium chloride. It con- tains about 1 eg. of bichloride in 1 cm. of distilled water, and is said to be better tolerated than sublimate. Benzoate of mercury is rendered soluble by chloride of sodium, and is prescribed thus for daily injection :— Hydrarg. benzoatis ~| .. 3 Ammon. benzoatis / ..... aa gr. 4 Aquse destil. ....... 3iss. Biniodide of mercury oil was introduced by Panas ; 1 c.c. contains yV gr. of the biniodide. It is an active and safe remedy, is well tolerated as an injection, and causes little pain or local trouble ;

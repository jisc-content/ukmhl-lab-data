MYXOMA connective tissue, it is undoubtedly the result of a clironic iuflaniinatory hyperplasia of the nasal mucous membrane, and all the stages of its formation can be traced from the earliest stage, in which there is merely a thickening of the mucous membrane in the ethmoidal region of the nasal cavity. When, however, all such allied conditions have been excluded, there still remains a tumour which deserves the name myxoma. Fig. .")4.â€”Microscopic section of a myxoma, showing a reticulum formed by processes of branched connective-tissue cells ; the intervening substance is mucinous. From a tumour of the sub- cutaneous tissue. It may occur in those situations in which ordinary fibromas iirise. and clinically is unlikely to be distinguishable from a soft fibrous growth. In the Museum of University College Hospital is a pure myxoma which was removed from the subcutaneous tissue and measured 4 cm. in diameter. It was perfectly encapsuled, and in the fresh state thick mucus could be expressed from the cut surface. After hardening it presented delicate hln'ous septa intersecting the trans- lucent tumour substance.

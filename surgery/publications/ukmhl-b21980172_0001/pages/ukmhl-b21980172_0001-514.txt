TUMOURS 434 occupied by foliaceous intracystic growths. These closely packed growths often give a very characteristic appearance to a section of the tumour which was aptly compared by Virchow to the centre of a split cabbage (Fig. 93). The true nature of the tumour will always be apparent on microscopic examination, which will show a transition from the typical structure of a fibro-adenoma to that in which the cystic transformation is very pronounced (Fig. 94). The cystic adenoma often presents an extreme degree of lobulation, and in such tumours the opening up of one of the superficial cysts Fig, 92.â€”Microscopic section of soft fibro-adenoma of breast. as the result of thinning and ulceration of the overlying skin may lead to a misleading appearance of malignancy, especially if an intra- cystic growth should protrude from the ulcerated opening in the cyst. It is, however, necessary to insist upon the benign nature of this tumour, which was at one time known as a " cysto-sarcoma." The cystic adenoma must be clearly distinguished from certain forms of cystic disease of the mamma in which the cysts are occupied by intracystic growths. In the former the cysts form part of an encapsuled tumour; in the latter the cystic change aSects the breast tissue itself, and no separate tumour is present. We know of no satisfactory proof that a carcinoma of the breast ever takes its origin from a simple adenoma. The same breast may

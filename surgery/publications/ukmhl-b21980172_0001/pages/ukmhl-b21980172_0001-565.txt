Round-celled sarcoma.—In describing tliis tumour little need be added to what has already been said (p. 455). In its typical form the tumour consists entirely of small round cells resem- bling lymphocytes, separated by a small amoimt of homogeneous or finely granidar ground-substance. The vascularity of the tumour is often great, and the blood is contained in vessels resembling embryonic capillaries among the tumour cells (Fig. 111). o^J»«-« "j^a'aS" 9<^'='%° <'=(P«.^i'.®^*e e<"^o^ "^''co* c » Fig. 111.—Microscopic section of round-celled sarcoma.

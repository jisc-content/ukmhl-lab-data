851 YAWS-DELHI BOIL —LEPROSY—MADURA FOOT —GRANULOMA OF THE PUDENDA By C. W. DANIELS, M.B., M.R.C.P., M.R.C.S. YAWS (FRAMBCESIA TROPICA) An endemic disease limited to certain parts of tlie tropics and charac- terized by a more or less abundant frambcesial eruption appearing in crops for one year or more. Tertiary manifestations may occur. Constitutional disturbance is rarely serious, and tlie mortality, except in ver}^ young children, is nil. Geographical distribution.—The disease occurs in tropical Africa, and is common on the West Coast. It is common also in many of the West India Islands, probably imported with slaves from Africa. In Fiji and most of the Pacific Islands it is indigenous and known as " coJco" {Thohu). It occurs among the aborigines in the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago, and is there called puru, and in Ceylon faranghi. In Assam and in Southern India local outbreaks have been recorded. Probably in these places the disease has been introduced by returned immigrants from the West Indies, or other countries where the disease is now endemic. Etiology.—No races are exempt, but the disease is rare among Europeans, unless they associate with the natives and adopt their methods of life. In countries where the disease is indigenous it is practically con- fined to the children, but susceptible adults imported into such a country are frequently attacl^ed. One attack protects for life, in the majority of cases. According to Castellani and others, the disease is due to a s^iiro- chsete, S. fertenuis, closely resembling S. pallida. The disease spreads from man to man by direct contact, or by contact with clothes, bed- ding, food, etc., fouled by the discharges from another patient ; or it may be carried by flies or chigoes from one person to another. In most cases the seat of inoculation is an ulcer or wound or other breach of the healthy skin or mucosa, and though it may occur in any part of the body, in children it is usually near the mouth.

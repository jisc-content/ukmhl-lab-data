TUMOURS 486 seems to us more accurate (Fig. 113). In some cases tlie structure of a tumour wliicli is obviously malignant cannot be distinguished from that of a simple endothelioma (p. 416). In other tumours it will be found that in some parts the growth has the characteristic structure of an endothelioma and in other parts the structure of a purely cellular sarcoma. Such a mixed structure strongly suggests that a malignant transformation of, a simple endothelioma has occurred, and this view is supported by clinical evidence. Thus, it not imcommonly happens Fig. 113.â€”Microscopic section of endothelial sarcoma of pleura. The tumour cells, of an endothelial type, are irregularly mixed with the stroma. that a tumour, after a prolonged and apparently benign course, may take on a more rapid rate of growth and assume the local and general evidences of malignancy. In the group of endothelial sarcomas may also be placed certain special forms of sarcoma, the cells of which are arranged in such a way as to suggest an endothelial or perithehal origin. Of these the most important is the angio-sarcoma or plexiform sarcoma, such as occurs in the pia, arachnoid, eye, and elsewhere. Microscopically such a tumour consists of capillary vessels bounded by large spheroidal cells in several layers. By a further proliferation of the spheroidal cells the meshwork of the vascular network becomes completely occupied by solid cell masses sej^arated by the capillaries, with possibly a slender

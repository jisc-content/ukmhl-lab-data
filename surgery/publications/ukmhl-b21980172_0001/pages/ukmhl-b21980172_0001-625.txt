CARCINOMA OF THE THYROID 543 Berry has pointed out that, even when a history of pre-existing enlarge- ment cannot be obtained, the presence of cysts or of areas of calcifi- cation in the tumour often affords evidence of previous disease of tlie gland. The liistological characters of the tumour vary within wide limits. In some instances, as in the tumour illustrated in Fig. 145, the structure is essentially spheroidal-celled ; in other cases the epithehum assumes a more cubical form and surrounds a definite lumen ; whilst in certain " ' ■re; 0 Si 54, '-^iJ^Oyl a St Q Ovg, Fig. 145.—Microscopic section of carcinoma of thyroid gland. rare forms of carcinoma the tumour retains, in both the primary and secondary deposits, a strildng resemblance to the normal thyroid tissue, and consists of alveoli containing colloid substance. Still more rarely the tumour has a papillary structure. In its macroscopic features carcinoma of the thyroid presents equally marked variations. In rare cases the whole gland is infiltrated by a soft growth, which, except on microscopic examination, is indis- tinguishable from a sarcoma. More commonly, the tumour is hard and nodular, and if limited to part of the gland may present such a degree of encapsulation as to produce a close resemblance to a simple adenoma. Lastly, it is very important to bear in mind that in certain cases of carcinoma of the thyroid, tiie naked-eye

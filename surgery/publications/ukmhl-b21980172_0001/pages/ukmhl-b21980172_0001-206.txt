146 INFLAMMATION The commonly employed Scott's dressing is a combination of this method and the last. Massage acts by favouring the absorption of exudate, through its mechanical action in emptying the lymphatics, and probably also by inducing hypersemia and quickening the blood-flow. Free incisions into areas of chronic inflammation are often of strilcing value. They enable the exudate to drain away, remove pressure from the vascular and lymphatic channels, and produce a condition of hypera?mia by the mechanical traumatic inflammation which follows their employment. Incisions are more especially useful in treating intractable chronic inflammatory processes affecting bone. Bier's hyperaemic treatment is largely employed and is of great value. General treatment.â€”All measures should be taken to place the patient in the best possible hygienic surroundings. Tubercle and sypliilis are two of the most frequent causes of chronic inflammation, and their presence calls for appropriate constitutional treatment. Such conditions as gout and rheumatism need the usual remedies ; and, finally, when the persistence of the inflammatory process is endangering the patient's life, more especially if recovery would leave a limb of doubtful use, the question of amputation must be considered.

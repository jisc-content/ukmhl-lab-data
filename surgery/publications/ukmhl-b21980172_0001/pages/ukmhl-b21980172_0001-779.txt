CHOICE OF ANESTHETIC 659 tion of chloroform during child'oirtli the baby may be drowsy with the drug when born, and may require extra stimulation to ensure proper breathing. Nature and the site of operation as bearing upon the choice of anaesthetic.—Operations upon the liead, neck, face, and pharynx, when they can be done within about ten minutes, are best met by producing a deep ether anassthesia and then removing the apparatus, giving no more anfesthetic while the operation is performed. Most cases of sebaceous cyst, harelip, epulis, epithelioma of lip, and suppurating glands of neck are well managed in this way. Fig. 181.—Apparatus for administration of ether by the nose. When a long operation is necessary the ana'sthesia tlms produced is allowed to become lighter until a brisk corneal reflex has returned, and then chloroform is administered from a Junker's inhaler and tube (Fig. 188). A similar plan is adopted for the removal of many teeth or for removal oj jaw or tongue, except that it is often best to produce the initial ansesthesia with C.E. mixture. When it is not convenient to continue with chloroform through a tube at the side of the mouth, the aneesthetic must be given through a nasal catheter (p. 675). Ether may be used throughout in these cases by means of the apparatus shown in Fig. 181. Tonsils and adenoids may be removed under gas ' or ethyl- chloride when the surgeon desires a rapid operation. A Doyen's gag (Fig. 182) is to be inserted before applying the face-piece, that time

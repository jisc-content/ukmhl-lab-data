793 SYPHILITIC TEETH occasionally affected. Still recorded a case of the primary central incisors resembling in every particular tlie so-called Hutchinsonian teetb. The permanent teeth show marked and characteristic changes, especially the incisor teeth of the upper jaw (Fig. 200), wliicli are shorter and smaller than normal; consequently there are gaps between the teeth, and when the mouth is closed the teeth of the upper and lower jaws do not meet; tlie edges are not parallel, but conical and wedge-shaped ; the free border is thin and crescentic, a Fig. 200.—Upper teeth of a woman who was the subject of inherited syphilis. All the incisors, and especially the central ones, showed the characteristic central notch. (Fi-cin /iH/chimoil's " Sy/'/ii/ls," 211,/ a/it.) central notch being caused by lack of development of the middle tubercle. The lower central incisors not rarely j^resent changes: they may resemble the incisors of the upper jaw, but more often they are rounded and, in their upper jjarts, deficient in enamel and therefore thin and rougli. Wallis reports notching in the canines, and the molars are not mfrequently dome-shaped, owing to the mal- development of their tubercles. Histology of skin lesions.—Hoclisinger found that the changes started from the small arteries and veins, as a small, round-celled infiltration, wliicli later involved the sebaceous glands, the hair- follicles, and the sweat-glands. Mast cells were very numerous, but plasma cells and giant cells were absent—quite tlie reverse of what one finds in acquired syphilis, where the plasma cell is so characteristic. The changes in the epidermis are entirely secondary in nature, and they never amount to more than a hypertrophy of

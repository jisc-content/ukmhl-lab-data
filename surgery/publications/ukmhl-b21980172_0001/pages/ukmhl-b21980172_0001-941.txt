805 VENEREAL DISEASES OTHER THAN SYPHILIS By C. a. LEEDHAM-GREEN, M.D., F.R.G.S. Anatomy. The lumen of the urethra.—In the resting state the walls of the male urethra are in contact with each other, and are only separated so as to form a canal during the flow of urine and semen, or the passage of a surgical instrument. The diameter of the lumen, or, more correctly, the extent to which the canal may be dilated, varies greatly in its different parts. The relative dilatability of the various portions is showTi in Fig. 202, which is drawn from a cast of the urethra taken in fusible metal immediately after death. The prostatic and bulbous parts are more dilatable than the penile and membranous parts. The meatus is not only the narrowest, but by far the most resistant. As will be seen later on, it is important to know precisely to what extent the several portions of the normal urethra can be dilated. This is indicated in the follow- ing table :— /'';■(Hc/i .•<cnk* The meatus . , 7 to 8 mm. in diameter = No. 21 to 2i Middle of penile . 10 ., „ „ = No. 30 Bulbous portion . 13 to 15 „ „ ,. = No. 39 to 45 Membranous portion 9 to 10 ,, ,, = No. 27 to 30 Prostatic portion . 13 to 15 ,, ,, ,, = No. 39 to 45 * I.e. will admit a urethral instrument of this size. Muscular fibres of the urethra and bladder.—Although it is convenient anatomically to divide the urethra into the several parts mentioned above, in practice the canal may be separated into two portions, the anterior and posterior. Tliis is no arbitrary division, but is founded upon an anatomical and j^liysiological basis. The anterior portion comprises the penile and bulbous parts ; the posterior, the membranous and prostatic. While the anterior portion is sur- rounded by erectile tissue, the posterior is enveloped by muscular fibres. Of these muscular fibres it is necessary to say a few words.

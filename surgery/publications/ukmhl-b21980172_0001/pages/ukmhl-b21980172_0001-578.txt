TUMOURS 496 may readily be mistaken for an ulcerated squamous carcinoma. Around the primary tumour secondary nodules, sometimes in large numbers, may appear in the sldn, or the secondary deposits may take the form of small brown or black stains. Another important variety is that which arises at the edge of the matrix of the nail as a narrow brownish stain. After ulceration has occurred the nail may separate, and the condition may thus closely resemble some forms of paronychia. For this reason Hutchinson suggested the name melanotic whitlow. The malignant transforma- tion of a pigmented mole may be evidenced by the occurrence of ulceration, by an extension of the pigmented area, by the growth of a raised tumour fi'om its surface (Fig. 120), or, with- out any striking change in the mole itself, by the enlargement of the neighbouring lymphatic glands. The section of a melanotic sarcoma varies much in its naked - eye characters. Some- times it is uniformly black in colour, but more frequently the pigment is present in the form of brown or black patches or streaks in the pinkish - white tumour substance, or may be limited to certain lobules of the growth (Fig. 121). The extreme malignancy of melanotic sar- coma is universally recognized, and while the primary growth in the sldn still remains an inconspicuous and sometimes undetected pig- mented spot, extensive deposits of growth may already have occurred in the lymphatic glands, and metastases may be widely distributed in the viscera and bones. To a certain extent, no doubt, the exces- sive tendency to metastasis is apparent rather than real because of the fact that even minute deposits are so easily recognized with the naked Fig. 121.â€”Section of the melanotic sarcoma illustrated in Fig. 120,

524 TUMOURS carcinoma should always be viewed with suspicion. In rare cases the secondary invasion of the bones, instead of taking the form of localized deposits, occurs diffusely, and causes softening of the bones, resulting in deformity rather than actual fracture. The subject of the metastases of carcinoma presents itself to the surgeon in two practical aspects. First, before deciding that a case of carcinoma is favourable for operation he must satisfy himself that no subjective or objective signs of metastases are present. Secondly, he must avoid the serious error of mistaking a secondary carcinoma for a primary tumour. This mistake is especially liable to be made Fig. 134.â€”Microscopic section of secondary deposit of carcinoma in head of humerus. The primary growth was in the cervix uteri. in the case of bone metastases, and there can be no doubt that many limbs have been amputated for tumours supposed to be primary sarcomas, but which were carcinomas secondary to some unsuspected primary tumour perhaps altogether unproductive of symptoms. A woman aged 52 was admitted some years ago into University College Hospital for a swelling in the region of the right shoulder, which proved on examination to be a tumour of the humerus. It was regarded as a sarcoma, and amputation was performed at the shoulder-joint. Subsequent microscopic examination showed that the tumour was a carcinoma (Fig. 134), and the patient was discovered to have an extensive cancer of the uterus.

SteriHzation of the skin by the strong alcohol and the iodine methods is the one exception to this statement. 2. The chemical methods depend on the use of the various antiseptic lotions and vapours, which will be discussed later. 3. Thermal, i. Dry heat is considerably less germicidal than moist heat of the same temperature, and therefore has been largely superseded. Occasionally the flame is used for the rapid disinfection of small instruments, such as vaccination tools, platinum loops, etc., or for bowls and similar utensils. ii.

484 TUMOURS 2. Oval and spindle-celled sarcoma.—In this variety of sarcoma the cells vary in form between short ovals and long slender spindles, and the nuclei correspond in shape. In the spindle-celled sarcoma the spindles are not always irregularly arranged, but ia parts of the tumour will often be seen to be collected into fasciculi which intersect in various directions. It thus happens that in a section of the tumour different fascicuU will be divided in different directions, longitudinally, obUquely, or transversely, and as a result the appear- ance may at first sight suggest that the spindle cells are mixed Fig. 112.—Microscopic section of spindle-celled sarcoma. with oval and round cells (Fig. 112). The blood spaces in a spindle- celled sarcoma consist of channels bounded by spindles arranged end to end and often indistinguishable from the other cells of the tumour. 3. Mixed-celled sarcoma.—The variations in the size and shape of the cells in many sarcomas are so great that such tumours can only be grouped together in one class. In many, however, the preponderance of one land of cell is so marked that the characters of the growth are determined by it, and it may be considered rather as a slight variation of the round- or spindle-celled variety. In any rapidly growing form of sarcoma it is not rmcommon to find a number of multinucleated cells present, and sometimes these may be so numerous

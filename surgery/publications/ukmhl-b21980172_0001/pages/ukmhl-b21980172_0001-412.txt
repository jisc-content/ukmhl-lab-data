334 CONSTITUTIONAL DISTURBANCES saline fluid into tlie empty vessels will raise the blood pressure at once^ and the immediate effect is wholly good, the heart beating more forcibly and the pulse showing a corresponding increase in strength and volume. Four or five pints should be injected into a vein, and as the blood pressure rises the pulse becomes fuller and stronger, and a general improvement in the patient is noticed. Unfortunately, how- ever, exudation of the saline fluid into the surroimding tissues soon commences, and this exudation progressively empties the vascular system, the blood pres- sure falls, and the pulse agam becomes small and feeble. A further injection can be given, and the blood pressure again raised, and the time so gained may tide the patient over a period of shock which otherwise would have been fatal. If the case is not of great urgency, continuous subcutaneous injection of normal saline, especi- ally if combined with adrenalin, is better than injection of a large quantity, for, although the effect is slower and not so Fig. 37.-Portable apparatus for rectal or Pressui-e subcutaneous infusion of saline. is mamtained for a longer period, and so more time is gained. It is obvious, of course, that saline injection in order to raise the blood pressure must not be made use of until all haemorrhage has been securely arrested. For measuring the blood pressure the Riva-Rocci apparatus is used (Fig. 39). In those cases in which loss of fluid either has not occurrea or is insignificant, the case is entirely different. The blood has not left the body, but has accumulated on the venous side of the vascular system, especially in the large veins of the portal area ; and the blood pressure falls, not because the vascular system as a whole is empty,

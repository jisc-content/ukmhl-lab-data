TUMOURS 378 Fibrous tumours of the body of the jaivs are also met witli. In the upper jaw they may grow from the periosteum of the external aspect of the bone, or from that lining the antrum. In the lower jaw fibrous tumours are occasionally met with in the interior of the bone, and by their continued growth may reach a large size, expanding and thinning the osseous tissue, and finally bursting through it. The accompanying figure shows the right half of a lower jaw the ramus of which is the seat of a large fibrous tumour of central origin; in Fig. 5.3.â€”Large central fibroma of right half of mandible. The osseous tissue of the body and ramus of the jaw is expanded over lower part of tumour. The condyle and the incisor portion are unaltered. \Un'n'ersity College Hospital M-uSfuni.) parts the tumour is still covered by a thin layer of expanded bone (Fig. 53). The diseased bone was removed by Liston from a man aged 30, in whom the tumour had been observed for two and a half years. In its early stages a central fibroma of the lower jaw can sometimes be easily enucleated after cutting away part of the expanded bone which covers it. In examining a central fibrous tumour, careful search should be made for any evidence of a tooth embedded in its substance, because some fibrous growths of this nature develop from the tooth sac of an unerupted tooth (the so-called fibrous odontome). Bland-Sutton figures a growth of this kind in a goat, the tooth being embedded in a mass of dense laminated fibrous tissue. In tumours of this nature deposits of calcareous matter may be found.

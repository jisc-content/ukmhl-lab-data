366 TUMOURS amount as to give an oedematous appearance to the tumour, or even produce a close resemblance to a myxoma. Here and there in a fibrous tumour more cellular areas, the cells of v/hich are chiefly spindle-shaped, are often seen, and are probably the situations at which the growth of the tumour is taking place.

Modifications of structure.—Fibrous tumours are liable to mucoid, hyaline, and calcareous degeneration, and when originating in the periosteum not uncommonly show small areas of ossification. As a result of mucoid degeneration, irregular cavities may form in the tumour, or the whole growth may become transformed into a thick-walled cyst. Tumours of mixed structure in which fibrous tissue forms part of the parenchyma of the growth are not uncom- mon, as, for instance, in fibro-myoma, fibro-lipoma, and fibro-adenoma. Diagnosis.—Many difficulties beset the clinician and the path- ologist in the diagnosis of fibrous tumours. From the clinical side it may be pointed out that tumours regarded as fibromas frequently prove on removal not to be so. The widely spread distribution of

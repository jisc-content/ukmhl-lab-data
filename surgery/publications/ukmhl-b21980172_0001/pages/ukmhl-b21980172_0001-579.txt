SARCOMA 497 eye, but even allowing for this j)ossible fallacy, there is no doubt that melanotic sarcoma is a most malignant tumour. The investigations of Handley show that even in its earliest stages the tendency to wide-spread lymphatic invasion is so great that very free removal of the tissues around the primary growth and the infected glands is necessary. Sarcomas fasciae may subcutaneous tissues deep of the occur in almost any part of the body, and vary widely in their histological struc- ture and clinical features. The small round-celled variety is the most ma- lignant, and may rapidly assume a large size, pre- senting in its earlier stages the characters al- ready described (p. 492), and eventually, after ul- ceration of the overlying sldn, producing a large fungating mass, from which repeated hiemor- rhages may occur (Fig. 122). Sarcoma of mus. cles is very rare, but is the most common tumour occurring pri- marily in this situation. It is probably more fre- quent in the muscles of the lower extremity than in tliose of the upper, and has been met with more often in the proximal than in the distal parts of the limbs. According to Butlin, the pectoralis major, biceps, and sartorius are the muscles most often affected. The round-celled sarcoma is probably most frequent. The tumour may reach a large size while still entirely surrounded by the fascial sheath of the muscle, but when the growth extends beyond this it rapidly involves the surrounding part. Glandular enlargement is exceptional, but metastases in the viscera have been recorded. In its early stages a sarcoma of muscle is likely to be confounded mth a syphilitic gumma, which is not uncommon in muscular tissue. ■2g Fig. 122.—Sarcoma of neck. iJ^mit a case at University College Hospital.)

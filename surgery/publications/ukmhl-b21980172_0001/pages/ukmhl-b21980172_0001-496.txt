4i6 TUMOURS endothelial cells tliat the endotheliomas are believed to arise. A special variety of endothelioma is that which originates in the endo- thelial cells of the perivascular space or adventitia of small blood- vessels. To this variety the name perithelioma is applied. In connexion Avith tumours of an endothelial structure, a difficulty arises in the fact that while some of them present the characters of Fig. 75.—Congenital macroglossia, the result of diffuse lymphan- gioma. The surface of the tongue is deeply furrowed and presents enlarged cystic papillse, benign growths, others assume evidences of malignancy and have the characters of a sarcoma. Tumours of the latter group will be found described among the malignant growths as " endothelial sar- comas " (p. 485). Microscopic structure.—In the most common form of endo- thelioma the striking histological feature is the presence of spaces lying in a connective stroma and lined or filled with cells. The cells lie in actual contact one with another, and whilst in some spaces they form a single layer and are flattened in shape, in others the cells are spheroidal or polygonal, and partially or completely fill the lumen. The spaces may thus closely resemble in section an embryonic vessel.

Among such tumours the presence of prickle cells, such as are normally present in the Malpighian layer or rete mucosum of the sldn, may sometimes be recognized, and in many forms the cells tend to undergo keratiniza- Fig. 129.â€”Microscopic section of squamous-celled carcinoma of skin, tion, or horny change. This change occurs in the central cells of the epithelium-columns, which, being farthest removed from the stroma, _ correspond with the most superficial layers of a stratified epithelium. As a result, the well-known cell-nests or epithelial pearls are formed in the cell-columns. On section, they present a characteristic con- centric striation due to the presence of layers of horny scales in the

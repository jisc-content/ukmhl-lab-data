SURGICAL BACTERIOLOGY 2 Moreover, at a time when treatment founded on bacteriological methods is being widely extended, and the use of vaccines as protective and curative agents is being more and more generally attempted, it is of the utmost importance that the surgeon should make himself familiar with the principles which underlie this method of treatment, and that wide clinical knowledge and experience should invariably direct and control its application. Although the idea that unlmown minute forms of life might be the causal agents of disease was suggested even in the pre-Christian era, and again brought into prominence by writers of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early part of the nineteenth centuries, the history of pathological bacteriology begins for all practical purposes with Pasteur. His epoch-making studies, between 1850 and 1860, of the phenomena of putrefaction and fermentation, which gave the death-blow to the theorj^ of spontaneous generation, at the same time proved beyond question that these processes were due to the intrusion of active extraneous living micro-organisms. The discoveries of Pasteur at once attracted universal attention, and his results were soon confirmed by numerous observersâ€”in this comitry more especially by Tjmdall, Burdon-Sander- son, and Lister. The practical genius of Lister speedily realized the vast importance which these discoveries possessed for operative surgery, and, in particular, for the events associated with the healing of wounds, and grasped the immense advantages which would result from the discovery of means for getting rid of harmful microbes from the field of surgical operations. Following the path marked out by the investi- gations just referred to, his own laborious studies (1867) laid a sure foundation on which, unaided, he was able to raise the noble edifice of antiseptic surgery, and thereby confer inestimable benefits upon mankind at large. His claim to gratitude is not diminished by the fact that fuller knowledge has developed antiseptic methods into aseptic ones, for antisepsis, and antisepsis alone, made the aseptic treatment possible. While Lister was engaged in proving the necessity and providing means for getting rid of micro-organisms in general in operative surgery, other observers were engaged in following out the illuminating work of Pasteur along other lines, and presently succeeded in estab- lishing bacterial specificity in a number of diseases. Davaine, who, in 1850, had already observed the presence of rod-like micro-organisms in the blood of animals that had died of anthrax, without definitely associating them with the causation of the disease, now returned to the subject (1863), and showed that such blood was only capable of transmitting the disease to healthy animals when these rods were present in it. He was confirmed, in 1876, by Robert Koch, who succeeded in obtaining pure cultures of the organism, and by his ex-

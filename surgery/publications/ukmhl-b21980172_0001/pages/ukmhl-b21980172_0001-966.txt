GONORRHOEA 830 best (Fig. 221). For the whole of the urethra, the conical bougies of Dittel or those of Guyon are most convenient (Figs. 222, 223). Instead of stopping at the use of a No. 12 English, as is generally done, it is needful to increase the size up to 18 or 20. But even Fig. 221.—Straight cylindrical metal bougie for anterior urethra. with these large bougies the urethra cannot be thoroughly dilated, for the largest bougie that the fully stretched penile portion will admit is too small to distend either the bulbous or the prostatic portion. , An instrument is needed which, like the urethrometer, can be passed through the narrow portion, and then expanded at will. Such an instrument is provided in the urethral dilators^ of Oberlander Fig. 222.—Metal bougie with short Dittel curve. (Fig. 224), Kollmann (Figs. 225, 226), and others. The dilator, well lubricated with glycerine and tragacanth, is passed down to the affected portion of the urethra, and then by means of the screw slowly expanded. The degree of expansion is indicated on a dial. The dilatation must be very gradual, not more than 1 mm. at a sitting, and must be stopped immediately it occasions pain ; it should not give rise to bleeding. After an interval of seven or eight days, when all reaction has died Metal bougie with Guyon curve. down, the dilatation may be carried to a fuller degree. After each dilatation the urethra must be irrigated with a dilute antiseptic, such as nitrate of silver lotion (1—5,000). In the interval, astringent injections, Janet's or Diday's, are to be used. As long as the secretion contains numerous gonococci, instrumental interference of any kind is best withheld, but the presence of a few of the micro-organisms is not in itself a contra-indication to treatment by dilatation. 1 These uretliral dilators are made in various forms. Figs. 224, 225 represent instruments designed to dilate the anterior urethra, Fig. 226 the posterior, and Fig. 227 both anterior and posterior.

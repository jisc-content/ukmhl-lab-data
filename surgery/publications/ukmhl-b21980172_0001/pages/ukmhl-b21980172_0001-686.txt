602 TUMOURS The rupture of a hydatid cyst may in certain situations prove immediately fatal, as, for instance, when it occurs into a large bronchus or blood-vessel. In other cases the detection of hooklets or fragments of membrane m the sputum, vomit, stools, or urine has revealed the nature of an otherwise obscure condition. When a hydatid cyst leaks or ruptures into the peritoneal cavity the results vary considerably in different cases. Sometimes peritonitis with effusion rapidly occurs, Fig. 168.â€”Hydatid cyst of orbit. but occasionally, as McLaurin has pointed out, a thin adventitious membrane forms around the fluid if the latter only escapes gradually, and a condition much like tuberculous peritonitis may result. Further, it is of interest that the peritoneal reaction may take the form of small multiple granulomas like miliary tubercles. A phenomenon sometimes accompanying leakage from or aspiration of a hydatid cyst is the so-called hydatid rash. The rash is usually urticarial in character, but it may resemble scarlet fever or measles; it is due to the absorption of some toxic constituent of the fluid. Another interesting observation which has often been made in

JUNKER'S INHALER 6/5 in the ordinary way—by " gas " and ether or C.E., or whatever drug the anaesthetist has decided upon as best in the particular case. A full degree of anaesthesia having been reached, then, before the opera- tion is begun, the Junker should be brought into use. If, for instance, the tongue is to be removed, a nasal catheter will be fitted on to the exit tube and passed along one nostril till the end of the catheter overhangs the glottis, as ascertained by a finger passed to the back of the mouth. The other nostril should then be plugged with a strip of gauze. With each inspiration a gentle compression of the india-rubber ball is made. In this way a constant chloroform anaes- thesia will easily be maintained, and the anajsthetist will be able to keep entirely out of the surgeon's way. If by reason of nasal defi- ciency a catheter cannot be conveniently used, the metal tube Fig. 188.—Junker's chloroform inhaler. is to be placed inside the mouth, well back on the side oj)posite to that of the tongue lesion. Both nostrils should be plugged with gauze. Neglect of this plugging-up of respiratory orifices, other than that into which the chloroform is being pumped, often renders it difficult to maintain quiet anaesthesia in the case of bad subjects. When used for ordinary cases, as opposed to those concerning mouth, nose, and throat, the exit tube of the Junker inhaler is fastened to a metal frame over which stretches a single layer of flannel. This mask is closely applied to the face, and after a few breaths have been drawn, to accustom the j^atient to the mask, a very gentle com- pression of the india-rubber ball is eft'ected coincidently with each inspiration. The strength of the conqoressions should gradually be increased, as much time (six to eight minutes) being occupied in inducing full anaesthesia as when the drop method is employed.

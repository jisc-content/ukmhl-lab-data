PATHOLOGY OF BILHARZIOSIS 899 The first naked-eye appearance may be groups of minute velvety liypersemic nodules on tlie mucous membrane, wliicli coalesce and form small friable elevations, sometimes topped with minute vesicles. Later, these increase in size and complexity, and form either papil- lomas or raised plateaux. The infiltration and swelling tends to spread throughout the whole thickness of the visceral wall, and may extend over the entire surface of the vesical mucous membrane. Scattered throughout the infected area are yellowish-brown granules, like wet sea-sand, of calcified ova ; Fig. 241.â€”Bilharzia ovum, with calcified contents, in the urine. The shell and its end spine are particularly well seen.

Ulceration may result from the pressure of the enormous number of ova wliich lie in and beneath the epithelium, or from separation of the papillomas by disintegration of their bases ; in the bladder and rectum it may deepen, and originate fistulse. Associated with all or any of the above lesions there may be a difiuse fibro-cellular infiltration, not only in all the coats of the viscus, but also in the connective tissue between its peritoneal or fascial attachments. On skin surfaces (vulva) papillomas may also form, and these, though firmer than those found on mucous surfaces, still have a peculiar friable surface ; in subcuta- neous tissues the deposit of worms and ova leads to ulceration, with or without preliminary abscess formation. Epithelioma may develop

TUMOURS 550 Carcinoma of the intestine is usually columnar-celled (Fig. 131), but the degree to wliich the columnar shape of the cells is preserved varies very greatly, so that, as already described, whilst in some tumours the alveoli are in parts lined with a single layer of columnar cells, in others the cells proliferate irregularly and partly fill the lumen, and in others the columnar t}^e is so entirely lost that the growth has the structure of carcinoma simplex. Car- cinomas of the intestine not uncommonly undergo extensive col- loid degeneration. The change commences by the appearance in the cell protoplasm of clear, colourless, highly refracting droplets, which gradually en- large and coalesce until the cell is re- placed by a gelatin- ous mass. By the fusion of the adjacent cells the alveoli be- come filled by a jelly- like substance, so that in those parts of the tumour in which the change is most marked all evidence of its epithelial nature may be lost. To the naked eye a colloid cancer presents the appearance of a deli- cate fibrous meshwork, the spaces of which are filled with the yellowish-brown translucent material. In all parts of the intestine a carcinoma may be met with in three chief forms of growth—as a shrinldng fibrous form causing an annular stricture, as an ulcer presenting the characters already described (p. 519), and as a fungating or papillary mass projecting into the lumen of the bowel. In passing along the intestine from the pylorus to the anus very striking differences are observed in the liability of the different parts to the development of carcinoma. Throughout the small intestine it is rare, and in the large intestine common. In the large intestine, although any part may be affected, it is most Fig. 147.—Carcinoma of jejunum.

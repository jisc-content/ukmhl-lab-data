304 CONSTITUTIONAL DISTURBANCES ASSOCI- ATED WITH TRAUMA By RUSSELL HOWARD, M.S.Lond., F.R.C.S.Eng. HAEMORRHAGE Definition and varieties.—Hsemorrliage is the escape of blood from the blood-vessels; and corresponding to the three varieties of blood-vessels there are three varieties of hfemorrhage—arterial, venous, and ccifillary—each with its own local symptoms and treatment. The general symptoms, which depend on the depletion of the tissues of blood, are the same for all varieties of haemorrhage. Hfemorrhage is also classified into external, when the blood escapes entirely from the body and can be seen ; internal, or concealed, when the blood remains in one of the large cavities of the body—e.g. the peritoneal cavity. A third classification of importance is into primary, intermediary, and secondary. Primary haemorrhage is the escape of blood from the blood- vessels immediately after the lesion which damages them—i.e. it is immediate, and is the variety of hfemorrhage most often seen and most often requiring treatment. Intermediary haemorrhage is said to occur when the bleeding is delayed but does not depend upon septic processes opening up the blood-vessels. It is most often seen after operations accompanied by a severe degree of shock. Hfemorrhage may not occur at the time of wounding of the vessels owing to the low arterial blood pressure ; but as the condition of shock passes off and the blood pressure rises, the temporary coagula are driven from the blood-vessels and hsemorrhage is started. Secondary haemorrhage is caused by ulceration destroying the wall of a vessel before thrombosis has occurred in it, and it may or may not have been preceded by primary hfemorrhage. The condi- tion is not seen so often as formerly when septic processes followed almost all operations, but it still remains as a most dangerous form of hfemorrhage with peculiar difficulties in its treatment.

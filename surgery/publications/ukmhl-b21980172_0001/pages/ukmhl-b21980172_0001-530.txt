448 TUMOURS Undoubtedly tlie most striking papillomatous growths of tbe sldn are the venereal ivarts to which reference has already been made. (Fig. 102.) TJiey occur in their most exaggerated form in the female, on the external genitalia and around the anus, where they may reach a large size, spreading over considerable areas, and having a cauliflower-like form. The sodden masses of epithelium which cover the papillary processes cause by their decomposition a peculiarly offensive discharge. It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the venereal papillomas and the condylomas, or mucous tubercles, which occur in similar situations in the secondary stages of syphilis. Condylomas merely represent a modified form of a squamous syphilide due to its situation in a part which is persistently moist, so that, instead of the scaly patch that characterizes the eruption elsewhere, the thickened epi- thelium accumulates in soft masses over the enlarged papillae. The mucous tubercle never assumes the markedly papillomatous form of the venereal wart, nor the large size often attained by the latter. True papilloma of the skin is undoubtedly rare, but is occasionally met with, especially on the face, as a small tumour composed of a tuft of slender, elongated papillae (Fig. 103). By the heaping up of the horny epidermic covering of a papilloma one form of cutaneous horn may

389 CHONDROMA iiig for seven years, caused obstruction to labour, and deatli occurred after hysterectomy. Both kidneys and ureters were dilated. It is an interesting fact that these cartilaginous tumours of the chest and pelvis appear to show no tendency to ossification, but are liable to mucoid softening with cyst formation (Fig. 62). The tumours illustrate in an extreme degree the lobulation characteristic of chon- dromas, and the presence of extensive mucoid softening accounts for the fact that some of the most prominent lobules may be elastic, or even give a well-marked sense of fluctuation. Fig. 62.â€”Section of a large chondroma of the pelvis. Large cysts resulting from mucoid softening are present in the tumour. The tumour arises from the sacrum, and the rectum, vagina, and bladder are seen in the section between it and the symphysis pubis.

They occasionally grow in muscles and fasciw. Erichsen refers to three cases, the tumours being in the tibialis anticus, vastus externus, and pectoral muscles respectively. Liston removed a chondroma as large as an orange from the lower part of the vastus externus muscle of a boy aged 15. It had been grov/ing for three years, and was first noticed two months after a blow. In the Museum of University College

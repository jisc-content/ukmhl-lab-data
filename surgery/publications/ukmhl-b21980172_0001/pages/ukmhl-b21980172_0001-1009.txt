873 ACTINOMYCOSIS By G. C. CHOYCE, B.Sc, M.D., F.R.G.S. General description.—Actinomycosis is an infectious disease due to invasion of the connective-tissue planes of the body oi tlie internal organs by the actinomyces or ray fuiigiis. Since its recog- nition in 1876 by Bollinger it has very frequently been found in herbivorous and omnivorous animals. In man it is considerably rarer, but less so than was formerly supposed. It was first recognized in England by Acland in 1884. There is now no doubt that some of the cases which have been classed as actinomycosis, and which clinically more or less closely resemble it, are caused, not by tlie actinomyces, but by an allied organism of the same group—the Streptothricefe. Only by careful bacteriological examination can the identity of the causal organisms be determined. In streptothricial infections generally, and jiarticularly in actino mycosis, the predominant characters are those of a chronic jn'ogressive granulomatous and fibrous infiltration of the connective tissues ; this is accompanied by the development of multiple small abscesses, which discharge a viscid exudate containing characteristic yellow or red granules composed of tangled masses of the fungus. Frequently in the central parts near tlie original site of infection the disease displays a tendency to spontaneous cicatrization, syn- chronously with a slow centrifugal spread at the margins. It is the cause of " wooden tongue " and " luoipy jaw " in cattle. Etiology.—The primary cause of true actinomycosis is the attack- by the actinomyces, the characters of which have been described else- where (p. 85). In the discharge from the abscesses, or in a section of one of the granulomas, it typically appears as a number of small, scarcely visible, red, yellow, or grey granules (the so-called " red pepper " or " sulphur grains "). If a granule be floated out in water it will frequently be found to consist of a central mycelium in which are entangled small round

CARCINOMA OF THE INTESTINE 551 common at the ileo-colic valve and cajcuni, at the hepatic and splenic flexures, and above all in the pelvic colon and rectum. Carcinoma of the small intestine very rarely occurs. An important example is that sometimes occurring in the duodenum at the papilla of Vater and causing obstruction of the common bile-duct. In Fig. 147 is illustrated a primary carcinoma of the jejunum which caused a chronic intussusception and was successfully removed. The small carcinomas occurring in the duodenum at the orifice of the if Fig. 148.â€”Microscopic section of the carcinoma illustrated in Fig. 147. common bile-duct are colunmar-celled, but in most of the recorded cases of carcinoma of other parts of the small intestine the tumour appears usually to have been a carcinoma simplex (Fig. 148). Carcinoma of the large intestine occurs chiefly in the situations already indicated, and when causing an annular " malignant stricture " is one of the most common causes of chronic intestinal obstruction. The other conditions which may supervene during the progress of the disease can only be briefly mentioned. As is the case with simple tumours, carcinoma is very liable to cause some degree of

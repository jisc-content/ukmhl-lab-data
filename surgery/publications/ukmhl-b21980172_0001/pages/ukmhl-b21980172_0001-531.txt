In tlie base of the horn is the vascular papillary projection on which it originated. Reference will subsequently be made to cutaneous horns which occasionally form from sebaceous cysts (p. 592). In this place it will be convenient to refer to certain formations which occur in tlie skin, but of which the papillomatous structure is Fig. 103.â€”Microscopic section of a papilloma of skin of face. not always a marked feature. We refer to soil warts and congenital Dioles. The soft wart occurs as an isolated tumour, the surface of wliich is in some instances papillary, but often smooth, or at the most marked by shallow clefts ; the tumour may be pigmented. The con- genital mole may present itself as a simple pigmented area in the skin, or as a raised warty patch, often hairy and deeply pigmented. Such hairy, pigmented moles may involve large areas, and, if present on the face, occasion hideous disfigurement. The pigment in these different forms of simple melanoma is present in spindle-shaped or stellate cells in the corium (chromato- phores), and also in the deeper layers of the epidermis. Some observers believe that processes of the chromatophores may extend between the epithelial cells. 2 D

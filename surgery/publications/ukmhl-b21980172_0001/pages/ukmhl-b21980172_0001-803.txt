REGIONAL ANESTHESIA 683 that the ansesthesia is not complete until at least twenty minutes after the injection, and that a longer interval, up to about forty-five minutes, gives better results. The anaesthesia lasts from one to two hours. 3. Regional or conduction anaesthesia. — This method of producing anfesthesia consists essentially in blocking the jath of sensory impulses from a given region by injections into or around the nerves which supply it with sensation.

In a larger number of operations tliis perinem'al method is com- bined with infiltration, in that in the latter attempts are made to inject the drug into the neighbourhood of the nerves going to the part; but the use of pure perineural and endoneural injections has produced excellent results. The so-called spinal analgesia, considered in the next article, is of course only an extension of this method. In making an endoneural injection, it is necessary first to expose the nerve under infiltration anfesthesia, and then with a fine hypo- dermic needle to inject the solution into its substance, care being taken not to stretch the nerve trunk tightly, and so cause consider- able pain. Crile, in 1889, amputated a leg after injections of cocaine into the sciatic and anterior crural nerves, and similar operations have been done in the upper limb after injections into the brachial plexus.

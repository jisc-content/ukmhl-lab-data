238 WOUNDS AND WOUND TREATMENT By C. C. CHOYCE, M.D., B.Sc, F.R.C.S. AND GWYNNE WILLIAMS, M.D., M.S., F.R.C.S. The term " wound " may be defined as a solution of continuity of the tissues, and would, therefore, include all subcutaneous injuries, sucli as bruises, fractures, etc., as well as the lesions accompanied by rupture of the surface. It must be remembered, however, that many injuries present mixed features ; thus, an open incision may be surrounded by considerable subcutaneous bruising, a perforation is frequently also lacerated, and so on. It is convenient, however, to describe wounds imder the following headings :— I. Subcutaneous—^not accompanied by obvious or immediately adjacent breach of surface : 1. Bruises and hsematomas. 2. Sprains {see article on Joints, Vol. iii.). 3. Fractures (see article on Bones, Vol. iii.). 4. Ruptures of muscles, nerves, vessels and solid viscera (see under the affected organ). 5. Ruptures of hollow viscera into body cavities {see under the affected organ). II. Open wounds—communicating with the surface : 1. Incised. 2. Punctured, gunshot, perforating. 3. Fissures. 4. Abrasions. 5. Lacerated wounds. 6. Contused wounds. 7. Friction wounds. 8. Burns {see p. 291). 9. Bursting wounds ; for example, by the pointing of abscesses, bursting of gummas, etc. I. SUBCUTANEOUS WOUNDS 1. Bruises and hsematomas.—A bruise implies injury to the subcutaneous tissues, or to the subjacent organs, due to impact

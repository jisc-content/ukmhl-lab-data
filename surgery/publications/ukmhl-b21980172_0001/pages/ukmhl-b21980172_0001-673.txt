TERATOMA 589 connected through a hole in the floor of tlie sella turcica with an intra- cranial tumour which presented seven rudimentary limb-like pro- jections, and contained, amongst other structures, cartilage, bone, muscle, nerve, intestine, and renal tissue. In connexion with the spine, teratoma is chiefly met with at the lower extremity as the congenital sacro-coccygeal tumour. This is usually situated on the anterior aspect of the sacrum and coccyx, between them and the rectum. It may reach a large size and project Fig. 104.â€”Microscopic section of part of a teratoma of the spinal column, showing a branching space lined with columnar epi- thelium and surrounded by unstriped muscular tissue. downwards between the lower extremities. Tlio tumour is usually partly cystic and partly solid. Among the histological elements found in such tumours may be mentioned various forms of connective tissue, often including cartilage, and spaces lined with columnar or, less commonlj-, stratified epithelium. In view of the complex structure of these tumours and the fact that derivatives of all the three blastodermic layers may be present, it is probable that they are rightly regarded as teratomas. It must, however, be mentioned that this view is not generally accepted, different pathologists having assigned their origin to the neurenteric canal, postanal gut, or Luschka's coccygeal gland. Morley Fletcher and Waring have recorded a case of sacro-coccygeal tumour which exhibited malignancy. The tumour was removed from

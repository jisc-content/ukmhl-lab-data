8o4 CONGENITAL SYPHILIS spirochsetes. This disappearance of the signs and symptoms of syphilis does not, liowever, mean that the patient is cured, and it is therefore important that an intramuscular injection should be given whenever the general condition of the child allows it. The dose should range between 0"004 and 0'005 grm. per pound weight. In children about 3 or more years old an intramuscular injection of salvarsan is generally given, but merely because intravenous injec- tion is so difficult. When the child reaches the age of 6 or 7 the difficulty is less, and an intravenous injection may usually be given. For a cliild aged 7, 0'2 grm. so administered would be the maxi- mum dose. One injection is practically never capable of converting a positive Wassermann reaction into a negative, and, if the general opinion be true that a positive Wassermann reaction is indicative of active syphilis, further injections are necessary to convert the reaction into a negative one. The common condition of interstitial keratitis is very unfavourably influenced by salvarsan. Women who are syphilitic before conception, or who contract syphilis while they are pregnant, should be treated with salvarsan. There is no risk of abortion, and a beneficial influence will be exerted on the future offspring. In both cases the treatment should be sup- plemented by mercury.

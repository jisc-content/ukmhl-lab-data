A rare example of bilateral dry gangrene affecting all four extremities, in a young West Indian native. The onset was sudden, and was accom- panied by numbness, tingling, and pain. In the absence of any history or evidence of endarteritis, syphilis, or ergotism, the determining cause must be ascribed to Raynaud's disease. Haemoglobinuria was probably present during the first two days. (C. C. C/ioycc's case.) Plate 28.

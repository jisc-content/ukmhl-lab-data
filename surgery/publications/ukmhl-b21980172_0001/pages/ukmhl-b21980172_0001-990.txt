854 DELHI BOIL The disease closely resembles that known in Fiji as " kanailoma," and is believed by many to be a tertiary manifestation of yaws. DELHI BOIL A chronic form of infectious ulceration met with in many parts of the tropics, but not evenly distributed. It occurs in Algeria, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, Northern India, etc., and goes by various names, such as Aleppo evil, oriental sore, bouton de Baghdad, Delhi boil, frontier sore, etc. We do not know how infection takes place ; but in any district where the disease is endemic it is advisable to keep any minute ulcer or other breach of the skin covered. It is possible that flies are the carriers of the infection, as similar ulcers occur in dogs. Fig. 230.—Parasite of Delhi boil in endothelial cell, with free forms. Clinical appearances and pathology.—The ulcers are usually on exposed parts of the body, the face, wrists, and ankles being most commonly affected. The incubation period may be a long one, for sometimes the sores do not appear for months after the patient's departure from an infected area. The lesions commence as small red papules, which rapidly extend and soon form ulcers. The nodules and ulcers are frequently multiple. They are characterized by their chroni- city and by the thick crusts which form on the surface. If this crust be removed, some milky or serous fluid may be seen, and the floor of the ulcer, consisting of flabby granulations, will be exposed. In scrapings of these granulations the broken-down tissue, on micro- scopical examination, shows bodies morphologically identical with those found in the spleen, liver, and elsewhere in kala-azar (Fig. 230). These non-flagellate bodies are the resting-forms of a flagellate organism.

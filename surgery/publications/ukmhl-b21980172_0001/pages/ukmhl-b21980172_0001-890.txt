754 ACQUIRED SYPHILIS The solid constituents of Aix water (Liebig's analysis of 16 ozs.

That rapid absorption through the skin does actually occur is proved by the appearance of mercury in the urine, by the occurrence of physiological eiiects, especially stomatitis, and by the production of therapeutic effects which are often intense. Mercurial ointment for inunction.—^At Aix, generally speaking, the ointment used is ung. hydrargyri (G.P.). Sometimes mercurial soaps are used, but these have the disad- vantage that they require considerable time for absorption. On the other hand, they are considered to be cleaner and less liable to cause irritation. At the Military Hospital, Rochester Row, the following ointment is used :— Ung. hydrarg. . . . . . . . gr. 1. Lanoline hydr. ....... gr. xxv. Adipis benzoat. . ...... gr. xxv. Dosage.—No definite rules can be laid down as to the actual dose of the ointment, as it depends on various factors, of which the chief is the degree of tolerance possessed by the patient. The average dose for an adult is 3i> but in some tolerant patients this can be increased to 3ii- A somewhat smaller dose should suffice for a woman, whilst for an infant from 15 to 30 gr. may be con- sidered safe. The best time for inunction is the morning, as the subsequent movements during the day favour absorption. Mode of rubbing.—Rubbing should, if possible, be carried out by trained rubbers; it should be done slowly, evenly, and with a good deal of pressure, so that, when finished, the part so treated

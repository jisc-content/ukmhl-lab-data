375 FIBROMA The overlying skin may be normal, but is often thickened and pig- mented. In the substance of the tumour or in the pedicle the thickened convoluted nerves can sometimes be felt, and no sharp line of distinc- tion can be drawn between this condition and the plexiform neuroma. In the limbs this form of neuro-fibromatosis gives rise to a diffuse enlargement like that present in other forms of elephantiasis, and well illustrated in Fig. .51. The condition is congenital, and the extensive growths usually take their origin in a pigmented spot or a molluscuni filjrosum.

Pars,i)ii In C iih;:rsity Colli-i^c Hospital.] Eeference has already been made to von Recklinghausen's case in which nmltiple neuro-fibromas, molluscuni fibrosum, and pigmenta- tion of the skin were associated. The presence of pigmentation is undoubtedly to be regarded as one of the special manifestations of neuro-fibromatosis, and was present in lU out of Tti cases collected by Alexis Thomson. It usually takes the form of small brownish spots like freckles, but may involve larger areas, and is most likely to affect the trunk and the proximal parts of the limbs (Figs. 47 and 52). In a considerable number of cases of neuro-fibromatosis death has resulted from the supervention of sarcoma, to which Garre applied

452 TUMOURS occasional cause of renal hismaturia, and the association of sucli tumours with renal calculi has already been mentioned. In 1897, Douglas Drew brought before the Pathological Society of London a very interesting specimen of multiple papillomas of the left kidney, left ureter, and bladder. The kidney was also the seat of a villous carcinoma which had extended to the neighbouring lymphatic glands. Fig. 105.—Papilloma of urinary bladder. The pedicle of the tumour is attached near the orifice of the left ureter. (This and ihc pj-eccdiiig ftguyc are from sptxiinens in University ColU-gc Hospital Mttseitni.) The renal calyces and pelvis and the whole length of the ureter were beset with delicate papillary growths, whilst in the bladder a similar growth was attached around the ureteric orifice. In such a case— and others of a similar nature are on record—the conclusion seems unavoidable that the growths spread along the urinary tract by a process of simple transplantation. The epithehum covering the papillomas of the urinary tract is of the transitional stratified form which is normal to the part.

3.33 TREATMENT OF SHOCK (7) Administration of saline fluid.—The method which has been most largely used of late years is the injection of hot (lOj'-llO' F.) normal saline fluid, with the object of raising the blood pressure by filling the vascular system with fluid. Saline fluid may be adminis- tered («.) by the rectum, either by running into the rectum one or two pints of the fluid by means of a catheter and funnel, or by continuous rectal injection at the rate of about one pint per hour ; (b) by subcutaneous injection, one or two pints of the fluid being injected into loose con- nective tissue either under the breasts in females or into the axillae and groins of males, or the fluid may be given continuously into the subcutaneous tissue of the thighs, about half a pint being injected each hour ; (c) by intravenous injec- tion, one to four or six pints being injected straight into a vein, usually the median basilic of the left arm. (Figs. 36, 37, 38.) In considering the value of this method of treatment, it is necessary to divide the cases of shock into those in which a large amount of fluid has been lost to the body, either by lueniorrhage or persistent vomit- ing, sweatmg, or diarrhoea, ancl those cases in which such a loss has not taken place to any extent. The ])lood pressure (which may be taken as the measure of the amount of shock) depends partly on the amount of fluid in the vessels, and although the adjusted mechanism of the muscular coats of the arteries and veins can compensate for the loss of a considerable amount of blood and the blood pressure remain constant, yet a limit is reached at which the blood pressure can no longer be maintained, owing to the lack of fluid.

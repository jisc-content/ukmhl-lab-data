In the former case the patient lived with an uncle who had a large rodent ulcer on the forehead. Rodent ulcer is occasionally multiple, but it is very rarely that the growths exceed three or four in number. Adamson has, however, recorded two cases in which the separate lesions, some nodular and others ulcerated, numbered respectively twenty or more and thirteen. The diagnosis of rodent ulcer from syphilitic and tuberculous ulcers is rarely difHcult, and from an ordinary squamous-celled carcinoma the Fig. 139.â€”Microscopic section of small non-ulcerated tumour of skin, having the histological structure of rodent carcinoma. (The tumour was removed by Lord Lister from the buttock.) diagnosis is based not only on the striking absence of definite tumour masses, but also on the prolonged course of the disease and the absence of glandular invasion. Occasionally, however, the histological structure usually associated with a rodent ulcer is found in a tumour presenting clinical features much more like those of the common fungating form of cutaneous carcinoma, and cases also occur in which the tumour, instead of appearing as a depressed ulcer, takes the form of a slightly raised plaque, not necessarily ulcerated on the surface (Fig. 139). Until recently, the surgical treatment of rodent ulcer was limited

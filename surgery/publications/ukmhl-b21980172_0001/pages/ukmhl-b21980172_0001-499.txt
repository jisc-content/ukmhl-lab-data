ENDOTHELIOMA 419 cellular tissue, but in some tumours it is largely myxomatous or hyaline (Fig. 78). From the above short description of the chief histological features of an endothelioma it will readily be understood that the resemblance to other forms of new growth may be very close. Thus, in some tumours of this class the structure is closely allied to that of an angioma ; in others the appearances may be confused with those of an eijitlielial tumour; whilst in yet another form the cell pro- Fig. 79.—Microscopic section of endothelioma of ovary. {From a case under tllc care of Dr. Herbert Spencer.) liferation may be so marked as to produce a structure difficult to distinguish from that of an undifierentiated sarcoma. General characters.—Endotliclioma may conveniently be studied in the tumour which is commonly known as the " farotid tumour.'''' Although occurring most commonly in the parotid region, tumours of essentially the same nature are met with in the sub- maxillary region, lip, palate, and orbit. The endotheliomas of this group frequently contain hyaline cartilage in the stroma, a feature which may be so marked as to justify the name " chondro-endo- thelioma " (Fig. 80). The presence of cartilage is probably explained by the derivation of the tumours from tlie indifferent mesoderm from which the branchial arches are developed.

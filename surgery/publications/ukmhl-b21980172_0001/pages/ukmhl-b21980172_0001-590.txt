5oS TUMOURS liigh, and very few cases of prolonged freedom from recurrence are on record. Sarcoma of the testicle is not common, and in many- recorded cases seems to liave been very definitely related to a previous injury. It is usually of the small round-celled form. Both clinically and histologically it closely resembles the soft, undifferentiated form of carcinoma which chiefly affects this organ. Nicholson, who has written a valuable thesis on new growths of the testicle {Guy's Fig. 126.â€”Microscopic section of embryonic tumour of kidney of a child. Hospital Reports), is of opinion that many soft cancers have been classed as sarcomas, and that sarcoma is really the less common of the two forms of malignant growth. The tumour presents itself as a uniform enlargement of the testicle, often so soft and elastic as to be confused with a fluid swelling. In the later stages it may perforate the coverings of the testicle, and even fungate through the scrotum. Sarcoma of the testicle in young children may be bilateral. The tendency of sarcoma of the testicle to cause metastases by way of the lymphatics as well as the blood-stream is generally regarded as greater than in the case of sarcoma in most other situations, but, as Nicholson suggests, this tendency is probably less marked than is generally supposed, on account of the confusion between sarcomas

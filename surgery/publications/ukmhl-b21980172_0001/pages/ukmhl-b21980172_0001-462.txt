384 TUMOURS liyperplasic in nature. Similarly, the cartilaginous outgrowths some- times occurring in the cartilages of the larynx can hardly be regarded as true chondromas. In the large joints, especially the knee, cartilaginous bodies occm* which originate in the synovial fringes, where cartilage cells can be demonstrated normally. Such bodies often tend to ossify, and, although at first attached by a pedicle to the synovial membranes Fig. 56.—Microscopic section of a chondroma, showing cartilage cells lying in a hyaline matrix and fibrous tissue forming the capsule of the tumour. frequently become detached and form loose bodies in the joint. These again cannot be regarded as true tumour formations,, particularly as they are often associated with, and doubtless result from, chroiuc joint diseases. Lastly, in the region of the branchial clefts congenital malformations occur in which cartilage may be present These are best illustrated by the so-called accessory auricles, wliicli consist of a central bar of cartilage covered by skin, and sometimes a muscular layer, and winch are teen most commonly in front of the external ear, but sometimes in the neck. A cartilaginous projection of this nature in the neck may correspond with the orifice of a cervical fistula. Structure.—A chondroma is usually perfectly eucapsuled and

ADENOMA 445 to note that Sliattock has shown that in these tumours the calci- fication may be associated with a very marked horny change in the epithelial cells of the tumour, and he suggests that such tumours may arise in connexion with the hair-follicles and not in seba- ceous glands. Adenoma of the sweat-giands. —Simple sweat-gland tumours have been described, but are of extreme rarity. In the Museum of University College Hospital is a piece of skin, probably removed from the cheek, and including a shghtly raised tu- mour, measuring 2-5 cm. by 2 cm., and 8 mm. in thickness. The tumour consists of convoluted tubes lined with epithelium, and closely resembhng the normal sweat-glands in appearance. It was regarded by Marcus Beck as an example of the growth de- scribed by Rindfleisch as hypertrophy of the sudoriparous gksnds." Fig. 100. — Sebace- ous adenoma of labium majus, in section.

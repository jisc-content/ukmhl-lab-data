The scope of tliis article does not allow any consideration of the purely historical, physiological, or chemical aspects of general anaesthesia. A general knowledge of these on the reader's part is therefore assumed, md the subject is dealt with from a solely practical point of view. PRELIMINAKY STEPS Certain steps should be taken in all cases before the administration of a general anpesthetic. Thus, a brief examination of the circulatory and respiratory eflficiency of the patient should be made by careful palpation of the pulse, and estimation of the respiratory capacity by placing a hand upon each side of the chest while a deep breath is drawn.

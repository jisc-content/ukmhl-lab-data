421 ENDOTHELIOMA \ the lip, from wliicli the section illustrated in Fig. 80 was made, was removed by Liston. It was of ten years' growth, and formed a rounded circumscribed tumour, 12 mm. in diameter, embedded in the substance of the lip. Similar encapsuled tumours are also occasionally found in the palate. In a case recorded by Christopher Heath, a tumour of this nature was removed from a woman aged 48, in whom it had existed since childhood. In 1888, Hutchinson described a peculiar form of " potato- like " tumour which he had ob- served in several cases in the upper part of the neck beneath the sterno-mastoid. A few years later, Marchand called attention to certain tumours of endothelio- matous nature that appeared to originate from the carotid body, which is known to be of a vas- cular and not a glandular struc- ture. Hastings Gifford found that a tumour of the kind de- scribed by Hutchinson was of a like structure (Fig. 82), and sug- gested that it was identical with the tumours of the carotid body studied by Marchand. The endotheliomas of the pa- rotid and neighbouring regions, although they may pursue an ab- solutely benign course extending over many years, may eventually extend into the surrounding tissues and exhibit very marked evidences of local malignancy. Such an altered mode of growth may be considered to result from the trans- formation of a simple endothelioma into an endothelial sarcoma. Endothelioma of the meninges of the brain and spinal cord is represented by the tumour to which Virchow applied the name fsammoma, or sand tumour. The name was suggested by the peculiar gritty surface sometimes presented by a section of the growth and due to small calcareous deposits. Microscopic examination shows that the calcareous deposit occurs in certain peculiar nest-like collections of endothelial cells (psammoma bodies), which mav be so marked as Fig. 81.- -Endothelioma of parotid region. {Front a case at University Collci^r Ilosfiitttl.)

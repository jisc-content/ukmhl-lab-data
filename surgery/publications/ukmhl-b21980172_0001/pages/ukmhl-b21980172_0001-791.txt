ETHYL-CHLORIDE 6/1 Ethyl-chloride is not well adapted for the maintenance of a pro- longed anaesthesia. An anaesthesia lasting between one and two minutes is generally obtainable from a single dose. Recovery of consciousness is rapid, but is more often accompanied by siclmess or by headache than is the case with nitrous-oxide. Moreover, faintness is sometimes a sequel, and fatal collapse has occurred in several recorded instances. Ethyl-chloride is therefore not to be regarded as on the same footmg of safety as " gas," and, in spite of its great convenience and extreme rapidity of action, should never replace nitrous-oxide Fig. 187(7.—Administration of ethyl-chloride from small bag of Clover's inhaler.

Carefid limitation of doses employed, early admission of a breath of air, and the lying-down posi- tion of the patient, are probably the most important points to be observed for securing safety with ethyl-chloride. In addition to its employment in the manner described, ethyl- chloride is sometimes used upon an open mask as a preliminary to C.E. or to chloroform. The object then is not to produce abso- lute anaesthesia with ethyl-chloride, but to induce rapidly an uncon- scious or semi-conscious condition during which the more formidable •drug may be inhaled without inconvenience.

438 TUMOURS several inches. It was readily removed through an incision in the bowel, after ligaturing the long, slender pedicle. Adenoma of the rectum occurs as the simple polypus not un- common in yoimg children. It forms a soft, red, pedunculated tumour, rarely larger than a small cherry. The pedicle may be sufficiently long to allow the tumour to protrude from the anus during defseca- tion, and spontaneous separation is probably more common than is supposed. Prolapse of the whole circumference of the rectal wall may be caused by traction of the tumour. A few instances of large adenoma of the rectum in the adult are on record, but such cases are much less common than are those of the simple papilloma (p. 4-51). The structure of a simple adenoma of the rectum is identical with that shown in Fig. 97. Adenoma of the umbilicus.—This is not uncommon in infants, and forms a small pedunculated tumour like a red currant. Fig. 97.—Microscopic section of adenoma of umbilicus. It causes a slight mucopuruleiit discharge, and is readily brought into view by everting the folds of the umbilicus. It can be removed by applying a ligature to the pedicle, or by dividing the latter with the point of a fine cautery. Occasionally a tumour of this nature is associated with the presence of a faecal fistula. A section of one of these little tumours shows a number of epithelium-lined tubes resembling Lieberkiihn's follicles. In the centre is a radiating core of delicate connective tissue, and amongst the follicles small lymphoid nodules are often present (Fig. 97). The tumour doubtless arises in connexion with the outer extremity of

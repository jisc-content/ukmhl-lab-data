135 CHRONIC INI I.AMMATIOX here, being eventually converted into fibrillated connective tissue- This hyperplasia is frequently seen in nnicous mcnibranes which are the seat of some chronic irritation, thr various elements of llie mucosa, but especially the lymph nodes, becoming thickened and often fibrous. Chronic interstitial overgrowth of fil)rous tissue is seen in the lungs in cases of anthracosis, silicosis, syphilis, glanders, etc., without any accompanying acute intlammatory changes, and a similar over- growth of fil)rous tissue occurs in the liver, kidney, etc.. in the .so- called chronic interstitial inflammations (cirrhosis of the liver, chronic interstitial ne])hritis. etc.). The essential changes in all these cases are degeneration and necrosis of the specially functioning elements, and a replacement of tliese l)y ti.ssue which is at first cellular, but later definitely fibrous. It is true that leucocyte emigration and other inflammatory phenomena often occur around these areas of what Adami calls " replacement fibrosis," but we regard these as secondary to the degenei'ation and necrosis. lUHI.locKAPH V Adami, 77/< J'rinciphf 0/ I'dtliDloiiij.

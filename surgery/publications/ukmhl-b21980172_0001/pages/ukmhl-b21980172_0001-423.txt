345 SEPTIC TRAUMATIC FEVER (Chart 3). These are spoken of as cases of sejjtic intoxication, and they frequently end in death, an excellent example being the acute infection of the placental site which occurs after confinement-—the so-called puerperal fever. Another form of the same variety of fever occurs when it is impos- sible to drain a sej^tic focus efficiently, as when suppuration occurs in bones, and there is a constant slight absorption of toxins taking place over a long period. The temperature in these cases is usually intermittent, with an MONTH July DAY OF MONTH DAYofDISEASE. / a v3 5 6 7 a 3 /O // 12 Id 102 MEMORANDA „ 106 105 104 0 105 0 102 101° 0 100 99 98° 0 97 0 36 M E M E M E E M E M E M E M E M;E M E M E M E M E -4— v; 0 I 1 1 t s/ -1- PULSE ^ 72 73 96 6^ //O $6 84 72 78 3Z 96 96 //2 100 <3-4 1 Chart 2.—Case of septic traumatic fever fol!owing operation. evenmg rise, and there is progressive muscular weakness, with emacia- tion, haemolysis, cardiac weakness, and other symjjtoms of toxsemia. Should the process continue the patient may die of exhaustion,^ or lardaceous degeneration of the smaller arteries will occur. Such case are sometimes spoken of as examples of hectic fever, but a better term is chronic sepsis. Treatment.—The treatment of fever due to wound infection is largely the treatment of the wound. The products of bacterial activity must be carried away from the wound by free drainage, and, if neces- sary, by incisions into the surrounding tissue.

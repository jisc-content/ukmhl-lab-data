TUMOURS 596 The cyst which is so frequently found at the outer angle of the orbit is by far the most common example of a sequestration dermoid (Fig. 166). It rarely reaches a large size, and, although it usually lies close to the external angular process, it is sometimes found in the outer end of the upper eyelid. The cyst is usually deeply seated, lying beneath the orbicularis on the bone, in which it may occupy a shallow depression. A dermoid cyst is occasionally situated in the middle line at the root of the nose. In two cases of this kind we have confu'med Bland- Sutton's observation that the cyst may be translu- cent. In one of these cases we found the nasal bones to be separated by the cyst, which extended so deeply that after its re- moval the upper edge of the nasal septum was ex- posed and each nasal cavity opened. The mode of origin of such a cyst is obscure, but a fine process of the dura mater can be de- monstrated in the infant between the nasal bone and the cartilaginous cap- sule of the nose, and pos- sibly a dermoid in this situation may be of intra- cranial origin. Dermoids of the scalp are most common at the Fig. 166.â€”Orbital dermoid. external occipital protuber- ance and over the anterior fontanelle. When in the latter situation the cyst may be firmly connected with the membrane closing the fontanelle, and when lying over the bone a depression or perforation may be present, and the cyst may even be attached to the dura mater. Dermoids of the external ear probably arise in the clefts between the seven processes from which, according to His, the part is developed. Such a cyst may present itself as a tumour over the mastoid process, and in a case of this kind dissection showed that the cyst could be easily separated from all the surrounding tissues except in fi'ont, where it was intimately connected through the cartilage with the skin lining the hollow of the concha.

The teeth in the affected pajt of the jaw become loosened, and in the place of those which have come away the tumour projects beneath the gums, and one or more sinuses may- lead into cysts in the growth. Examined microscopically, the solid parts of the tumour present a connective-tissue stroma in which are branching spaces, filled with Fig. 143.â€”Microscopic Eection of tubular carcinoma of antrum. epithelial cells. The cells forming the peripheral layer of the cell- masses are usually cubical or columnar in shape, while the remaining cells are small, and elongated or angular. The formation of cysts is due to changes in the masses of epithelium, the central cells of which undergo degeneration, whilst the peripheral cells remain as a lining to the cyst (Fig. 144).

290 MILITARY SURGERY injuries should be made, and lymph should not be disturbed ; all that is necessary is to drain the abdomen by several small incisions suitably placed. Localized abscesses in connexion with the large intestine require opening and drainage. Extraperitoneal wounds of the large intestine need free drainage ; the external wound should be enlarged and the bowel brought to the surface and fixed by sutures, or a tube may be put into the bowel and the wound packed round it. Suture of the intestinal wound is seldom practicable. In wound of the rectum faeces must be prevented from finding their way along the bullet track. This may be done by colotomy, or by dividing the spliincters so as to give free escape for the faeces and keep the rectum empty. All wounds of the bladder require that the viscus should be kept empty, either by tying in a catheter or by draining through a suprapubic or a median perineal incision. Wounds of the kidney seldom call for treatment, except the opening of a perirenal abscess, should one form. Wounds of the external genitals are usually of little im- portance. Perforations of the penis may cause some bleeding, and lead to defornaity on erection later. Wounds of the urethra should be sutured if possible, and extravasation of urine watched for. Wounds of the testicles cause a good deal of shock, but usually heal readily. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bowlby and Wallace, A Civilian War Hospital.

676 GENERAL ANESTHESIA The other inhalers of the plenum type, though more accurate instruments than the Junker, suffer from complexity and lack of portability. They are excellent for use in institutions where portability is not required, and one or another shoidd be available wherever students are taught the use of chloroform. Alcock's apparatus, as being the most convenient, may be briefly described. It consists (Fig. 18M) of a circular copper vessel, 5 in. in diameter and 4| in. deep. Fig. 189.â€”Alcock's regulating chloroform inhaler. which contains 150 c.c. of chloroform. A shelf, closed except for two oblong holes, is fixed 1| in. from the bottom of this chamber. Directly above and touching this shelf is a circular plate, movable by means of a hollow rod in the centre, and pierced by two triangular apertures. These can be adjusted by the central rod to expose more or less of the oblong holes in the shelf, and so produce larger or smaller openings into the space below. Air (supplied from a small foot-bellows or from an electric fan) enters the chamber by one tube opposite one aperture and leaves by another tube opposite the other, taking up more or less chloroform vapour according to the size of the

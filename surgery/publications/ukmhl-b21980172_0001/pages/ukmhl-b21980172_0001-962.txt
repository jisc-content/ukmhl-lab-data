GONORRHCEA 826 which is swollen and liypersemic, and projects into the tube, looking not unlike a ripe raspberry. Hard infiltration.—Pari passu with the gradual cicatrization of the soft small-celled infiltration, the liypersemia, turgescence, and elasticity of the affected mucous membrane diminish. The red, angry-looking membrane becomes paler and paler as the infiltration hardens. The epithelium becomes thicker and less transparent; frequently it takes on a curious stippled appearance, and may undergo so marked a pro- liferation as to give rise to a form of pachydermia. The longitudinal folds of the mucous membrane gradually disappear, becoming both less marked and less numerous (Fig. 214). The urethra as it appears during the process of healing. —The gradual healing of the inflammatory process under appropriate treatment can be readily observed by means of the endoscope. The mucous membrane covering the soft infiltration gradually loses its angry red colour, and regains its normal appearance. As the swelling of the membrane dies down, the longitudinal folds become finer and more numerous, and the lining epithelium regains its bright, trans- parent, glistening appearance. It is around the crypts and follicles of the urethra that the inflammation is seen to linger longest. For some time after the rest of the urethra has regained its healthy appear- ance a zone of inflammation may be seen to surround the openings of the large lacunae and glands, from the mouths of which a muco- purulent secretion may occasionally be expressed. Goldschmidt's irrigation urethroscope.—A urethroscope con- structed on an entirely new principle has recently been introduced by Goldschmidt of Berlin (Fig. 215). It consists of a clever adaptation of the ocular arrangement of Nitze's cystoscope to the requirements of the urethroscope. The urethra is examined whilst distended by a stream of water, which serves less to cool the electric lamp than to

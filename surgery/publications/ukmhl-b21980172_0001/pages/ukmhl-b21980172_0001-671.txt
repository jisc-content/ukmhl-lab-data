TERATOMA OF THE TESTICLE 587 by Wilms, who supposes that they arise in the reproductive cells them- selves, by a process analogous to partliogenesis. Although the solid teratoma of the testicle may pursue a benign course, it occasionally, like the corresponding tumour of the ovary, undergoes a malignant change, and may thus j^robably beliave as a carcinoma or as a sarcoma. In a case recorded by Horsley in the Transactions of the Pathological Fig. Microscopic section of teratoma of testicle, showing con- nective-tissue stroma containing cartilage and spaces lined with columnar and cubical epithelium, and two masses of stratified epithelium. Society, the secondary tumours in the lungs and liver were purely sarcomatous, although the primary growth in the testicle contained spaces lined with columnar epithelium. As an example of a teratoma of the testicle producing metastases of complex structure may be mentioned the classical case described by Paget in 1855 as a malignant enchondroma, in which the cartilaginous growth reached the vena cava by way of the spermatic

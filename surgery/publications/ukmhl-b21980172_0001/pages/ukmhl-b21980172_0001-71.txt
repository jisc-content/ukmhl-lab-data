39 STAINING METHODS the other of dilute Czaplewski's fuchsin. ^ A little of tlie culture is rubbed up in each drop and a cover-glass placed upon each, care being taken to include some air bubbles to facilitate focussing. The drops must be so small that the cover-glasses do not float upon them, and that no fluid escapes around their edges. If the B. diphtheria} is suspected, a wet film may also be put up with Bio's stain,^ which very greatly facilitates the diagnosis. {See p. 73, under B. dij)Jif}ierii_e.) Staining of dried films.—Dried films prepared as already directed may be stained by one of the following staining methods. In all cases damar dissolved in xylol is recommended for permanent mounting in preference to the use of Canada balsam. Simple Staining with Basic Aniline Dyes 1. Dry the film thoroughly in ah: 2. Fix by flaming, or (e.g. blood-films) in ether-alcohol.'^ 3. Stain with Czaplewski fuchsin,* neutral red,'^ thionin,® or methylene blue,^ for 2 minutes. 4. Wash with tap-water. 5. Dry roughly by pressing out beneath several thicknesses of filter- paper. 6. Dry thoroughly in air. 7. Mount in xylol damar. Ziehl-Neelsen's Stain foe Acid-Fast Bacteria (Tubercle, etc.). 1. Dry the film thoroughly in air. 2. Fix by flaming. 3. Pour on carbol-fuchsin*^ and heat till steam rises; then leave to s'and for 5 minutes. 4. Wash rapidly with tap-water. 5. Decolorize with 25 per cent. H.iSO^ for 3 to 5 seconds.'' 6. Wash with 60 per cent, alcohol till no more colour comes out. Or, 5a.

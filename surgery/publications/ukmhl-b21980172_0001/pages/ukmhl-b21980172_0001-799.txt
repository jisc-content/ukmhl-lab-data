679 TREATMENT AFTER ANAESTHESIA tion of tlie sitting position, if permissible. Tlie sixspicion of delayed chloroform poisoning," as suggested by repeated sickness in a child, should be treated by washing out the stomach and leaving in it 2-4 ounces of a solution of sodium bicarbonate (10 gr. to the ounce) in 80 per cent, glucose. The unpleasant taste of ether, if it clings about the mouth, will often be neutralized by permittmg the patient to suck lemon-peel. Careless moving of the patient back to bed after operation is often responsible for the initiation of vomiting. It should be done with as little jolting or rolling of the patient as possible, and with careful support of the head. The best routine position in which to lay the patient during the period of " coming round " is on the right side, with the head and shoulders raised. BIBLIOGRAPHY Beddard, A. P., Lancet.

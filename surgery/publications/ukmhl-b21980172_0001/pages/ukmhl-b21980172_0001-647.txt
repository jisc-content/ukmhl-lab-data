FACET'S DISEASE 565 Paget's disease. The condition, although somewhat resembling, is essentially distinct from simple eczema. Beginning at the nipple, the dermatitis slowly spreads centrifugally over the areola, and even beyond it, so that eventually a patch several inches in diameter may result. The surface of the sldn is red and excoriated, and the seat of small crusts resulting from the dried serous dis- charge. Scattered over the reddened surface are often seen small white islands in which the cuticle has not been entirely shed. The Fig. 155.â€”Microscopic section of skin of a breast affected with Paget's disease. The breast was the seat of a carcinoma. sldn is slightly thickened, and the margin of the aii'ected patch is sharply defined. The nipple, as a rule, becomes gradually retracted, and its surface may be ulcerated. The liistological changes fomid in the aiiected sldn and the underlying breast tissue have been studied by Butlin and others. They consist essentially of a proliferation of the epithelium and inflammatory infiltration of the coriuni (Fig. 155). The epithelial prohferation has been traced along the ducts into the glandular acini. Reference has already been made to the fact that Darier and Wickham, and subsequently other observers, found certain cell inclusions in the epithelium which were at one time regarded as parasitic in nature (p. 4C3). The intimate connexion between this form of dermatitis and carcinoma of the breast is well showm by the cases collected by Bowlby in 1891. Among the 36 cases a cancer of the breast was present in 2-j, and, although in the remaining cases in wliich no tumour

TUMOURS 386 and free from any evidence of recurrence. A cartilaginous tumour of this nature in the long bones is rare, and must carefully be dis- tinguished from a chondrify- ing sarcoma, which in some instances may present the naked-eye appearances of a simple chondroma. 2. Cartilaginous tumours are not uncommon in the hand in connexion with the meta- carpal bones and phalanges, and less frequently occm- in the corresponding bones of the foot; they are often multiple, and may thus occa- sion very serious deformity (Fig. 58). A cartilaginous tumour of this nature origin- ates in the interior of the bone, which is gradually ex- panded until the growth pro- trudes through the compact tissue, sometimes forming a mass of considerable size (Fig. 59). In this variety of chondroma the only modification commonly met with in the structure of the tumour is calcification (Fig. 60). This does not modify the clinical Fig. 58.—A hand deformed by the pre- sence of multiple chondromas of metacarpus and phalanges.

The calcareous deposit sometimes occurs also in

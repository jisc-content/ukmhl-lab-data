487 SARCOMA reticulum of connective tissue. To tliis variety the name alveolar or large round-celled sarcoma is applied. It is not uncommon in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and in its histological features closely resembles an undifferentiated carcinoma (Fig. 114). In some tumours of this group the cells are arranged in radiating fashion around a central vessel, and evidently arise from tlie endo- thelium of the adventitia or of the perivascular space. From these Fig. 114.—Microscopic section of alveolar'sarcoma of neck. cells a network of slender columns extends into the surrounding tissue. This variety is Imown as a perithelial sarcoma. In the angio-sarcoma the walls of the vessels sometimes undergo hyaline degeneration, producing the tumour known as a cylindroma. 5. Melanotic sarcoma.—This variety of sarcoma is charac- terized by the presence of a pigment, known as melanin, in the cells. It occurs in the form of highly refracting amorphous granules, which inay collect in such amount as to enlarge the cell and completely obscure its structure. Under the microscope the granules usually present a bright j'ellowish-brown colour, but to the naked eye the growi;h may, in parts at least, be quite black. In j^atients suffering

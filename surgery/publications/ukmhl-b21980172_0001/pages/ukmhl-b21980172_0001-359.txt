281 GUNSHOT FRACTURES displaced to so great an extent, and the exit wound is not so large and lacerated. The stellate or " butterfly " form of fracture may be seen when a bullet at moderate velocity strikes a l)oue centrally, four main fissures radiating to the surface and splitting off a wedge-shaped piece on each side, the ends of the main fragments being pointed (Plate 29, Figs. 2 and 3). If a l)one is struck tangentially two fissures may pass from the point struck to the opposite side, producing a wedge fracture (Plate 30). Even at short ranges the shaft of a bone may be cleanly perforated by a bullet, but this is exceptional. Oblique and spiral fractures are also rare.

' ' articular ends of long bones, are usually perforated by the small-ljore bullet, and broken up by larger bullets, Init they may be comminuted by the small-bore bullet at short ranges. In the treatment of gunshot fractures the prevention of infection is of the greatest importance. Unfortunately it is in badly com- minuted fractures with large or explosive exit wounds that infection is most difficult to prevent. On the field the first field dressing must be applied, and the limb fixed by temporary or improvised splints. At the Field Ambulance the skin must be cleansed and the fracture immobilized for the patient's journey to the base. For this the aluminium field splint devised by Sir Frederick Treves serves ad- mirably, except for fractures of the femur, for which a long splint with a perineal band must be used and ^he patient kept on the same stretcher till he reaches his destination.

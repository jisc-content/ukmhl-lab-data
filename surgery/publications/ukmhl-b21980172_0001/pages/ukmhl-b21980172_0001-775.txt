C.E. MIXTURE 655 easily rendered dangerous, and (4) one the administration of which is easily learnt. To meet these requirements there is nothing better than the mixture of chloroform and ether known as the C.E. mixture/ administered from a drop- bottle upon an open mask. The drop-bottle should hold at least three ounces, and should be capable of administering the drops slowly, rapidly, or in a continuous stream. This is possible from a bottle provided with a top designed by Hewitt (Fig. IT'^) or from a Thomas's drop-bottle. The mask should be a light metal frame enclosing an area of al)out five inches by three, and high enough to avoid touching the nose when applied to the patient's face. It sliould be covered with a single layer of thin flannel or domette. The most convenient form of maslc is a Schimmelbusch's (Fig. 179), having the handle placed at one side. The flannel or domette should be cut so as to leave a margin beyond tlie metal edge of the mask, and should be fresh for each case. As the material is inexpensive and re- quires no elaborate fitting or stitching, this change is easily effected. Fig. 179.—Schimmelbusch's mask. Alethod of adni mist rat ion.—The mask is applied closely to the face, and after a few breaths the mixture is added, a very few drops ^ The mixture is made of chloroform 2 parts and ether 3 parts, by vohiine, shaken together. It must be freshly made. Fig. 178. Hewitt's drop- bottle.

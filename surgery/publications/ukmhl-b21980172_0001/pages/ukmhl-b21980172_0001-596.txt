514 TUMOURS epithelial cell in which the growth originated. Very frequently, however, this is not the case, and the cells in their atypical growth lose all trace of their original form and assume such an altogether undifferentiated shape and arrangement that the character of the normal epithelium in which the cancer cells originated cannot be distinguished. It will therefore be seen that it is not possible to classify the carcinomas according to the varieties of the normal epithelia, for often a histological examination of a tumour will not Fig. 127.â€”Microscopic section of carcinoma simplex, from the breast. suffice to indicate the variety of epithelium in which it took its origin, and the cell-masses of a carcinoma arising in a columnar or stratified epithelium may in the course of their growth become indistinguishable from those arising in the spheroidal or polyhedral cells of a glandular organ. For this reason it is convenient to distinguish the form of cancer in which the cells are altogether undifferentiated as the car- cinoma simplex, and subsequently to describe those forms in which the cells retain more or less distinctly the characteristic features of the specialized forms of epithelium. In carcinoma simplex the cells are arranged in solid masses (Fig. 127) ; they vary much in form, and whilst in some tumours

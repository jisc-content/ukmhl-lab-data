8/2 GLANDERS 200 c.c. has been given at intervals within three weeks ; or by the use of repeated doses of mallein, for which beneficial effects have been claimed. Some hope has been held out, by the publication of suc- cessful cases, that a vaccine may prove curative. This method should certainly receive a trial. Of drugs, mercury by inunction, potassium iodide, and aconite have been vaunted in the treatment of more chronic cases, but none has any specific action. Rontgen and other rays, and the various forms of electrical influence, have been em- ployed, but without much success, for indolent lesions of the mouth and nose. Prognosisâ€”It has been stated that 50 per cent, of the chronic cases get well (Sims Woodhead). This estimate is certainly much too high ; 20 per cent, would be a closer approximation to the facts. Temporary recoveries may occur in the higher proportion, but many of them relapse, and not a few eventually succumb to the disease. The outlook in cases of pysemic tjrpe, particularly when a generalized eruption has appeared, is gloomy in the extreme. BIBLIOGRAPHY Auer, JaJiresh. d. qesnmmte Med.. 1884, 1. 607.

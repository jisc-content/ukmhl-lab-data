TUBERCULOSIS 714 •dense fibrous tissue, may undergo softening or liquefaction, or may become calcified. Softening and breaking down are especially seen in infections of the skin, testicle, kidney, and synovial membranes, and are also common in the lymphatic glandular infections, whereas calcification and fibrosis are more common in lymphatic glands than in other situations. Tuberculous abscess.—This form of chronic abscess is due to a breaking-down of tuberculous caseous material into a thick creamy fluid, but is always accompanied by more or less inflammation of the surrounding parts. The wall of the abscess may be lined by caseous material, or it may be made up of condensed fibrous tissue. This subject is dealt with more fully elsewhere in this work.

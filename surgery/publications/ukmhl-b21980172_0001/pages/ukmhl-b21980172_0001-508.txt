428 TUMOURS deposits may be limited to parts of the tumour, or may be so exten- sive that the tumour is almost entirely converted into a stony mass. Among other changes to which these uterine tumours are liable may be mentioned suppuration and, in the case of submucous myoma, sloughing and gangrene. Subserous tumours occasionally become hsemorrhagic as the result of torsion of the pedicle. Finally, it is an important fact that a fibro-myoma of the uterus may undergo a sar- comatous transformation. This may occur without, in the early stages, any striking change in the gross features of the tumour, but later the affected part presents a homogeneous and wax-like appearance. Fibro-myoma of the alimentary canal.—Fibro-myomas of the alimentary tract may project beneath the mucous membrane, or serous coat. In Fig. 85 is illustrated a large submucous fibro- myoma of the oesophagus, which had occasioned such extensive pressure necrosis of the oesophageal wall as to lay bare some of the cartilaginous rings of the trachea. The tumour had caused dys- phagia, which was thought to be the result of malignant disease of the oesophagus, and for which gastrostomy was performed. Numerous cases of fibro-myoma of the stomach are on record, in several of which the tumour, even though of small size, occasioned pyloric obstruction. Small, simple polypi of the intestine may belong to this class of tumours, and are of clinical importance chiefly as an occasional cause of intussusception. NEUROMA A neuroma is a tumour composed of nerve tissue, and, as such, is of extreme rarity. It has already been pointed out that the name Fig. 86.—Microscopic section of ganglionic neuroma. iFjoni K)inuss's cast', Virchoius Arch., vol. cliii., 189?,)

CARCINOMA OF THE SKIN 527 From the prolonged medicinal use of arsenic, usually in the treat- ment of psoriasis, the skin, especially of the palms and soles, may become dry, harsh, and so thickened as to produce a well-marked condition of keratosis, in which corn-like tliickenings also occur. Hutchinson, wlio has drawn special attention to this subject, has collected a considerable number of cases in which carcinoma has supervened upon this condition, the malignant growth presenting itself as an intractable ulcer, beginning in a fissure or corn, usually on the hand or foot (Fig. 135). In one recorded case, a woman of 25, who since the age of 5 had fre- quently taken arsenic for pem- phigus, and in whom the skin of the hands and fingers was very rough, developed a large ulcer, almost certainly malignant, be- hind the crest of tlie ilium, followed by a glandular swelling in the groin which ulcerated. This case is of special interest on account of the extreme rarity of carcinoma of the skin of the trunk. Among 55 cases of squamous carcinoma of the skin of the hand, collected by Lenthal Cheatle, in 53 the disease oc- curred on the dorsum, and the most common site was found to be the skin covering the radial side of the second metacarpal bone. Two interesting observa- tions have been made by Cheatle in connexion with this fact. First, in this position Head ob- served the formation of a trophic ulcer in an area rendered ana:'S- thetic by division of certain sensory nerves, thus suggesting that this region is especially exposed to external irritation. Secondly, the atropine changes sometimes met with in the skin in old age, in which it becomes shiny, smooth, inelastic, and pigmented, are especially marked in this situation.

892 HYDROPHOBIA by different experimenters with a view to making it simple. Thus, Hogyes employs, in place of dried cord, a very diluted fixed virus. He injects successively emulsions of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100 of fresh fixed virus. The results are quite as good. This method is also employed at Madrid and Sofia. Recently, A. Marie has introduced into practice the use of mixtures of rabic virus and serum of sheep hypervaccinated against rabies. Tliis process consists in injecting on three successive days under the skin of the abdomen of the infected patients 2 c.c. of emulsion of fresh fixed rabic virus (1 in 10) to which 4 c.c. of antirabic sheep serum has previously been added. After the sixth day the patient is subjected to daily injections of dried cord. While the antirabic serum alone has no preventive efficacy, it has been shown experimentally that the injection of mixed virus and serum (with excess of virus) confers a very solid immunity against hydro- phobia. Since 1904 this technique has been employed with absolute success at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in the treatment of all patients who present themselves with a serious bite, but the majority of the patients are still subjected to the classic Pasteurian treatment. The average mortality from hydrophobia was formerly about 15 per cent, among persons bitten in the limbs, and 80 per cent, of those bitten in the face. Since the Pasteurian preventive treatment came into use it has progressively decreased to less than 0'23 per cent. This simple comparison of figures is sufficiently eloquent.

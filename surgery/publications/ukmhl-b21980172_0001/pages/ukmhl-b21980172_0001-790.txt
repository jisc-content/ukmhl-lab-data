6/0 GENERAL ANESTHESIA The administration is thus conducted : A small prop is placed between the patient's teeth, because of the frequency with which severe jaw-spasm arises. A dose of ethyl-chloride (2 c.c. for children up to four years of age, 3 c.c. up to ten, 4 c.c. for older children and women, and 5 c.c. for men) is sprayed into the bag through its top. The face-piece is gently adapted to the face so as to catch an expiration and then remain in close contact. The patient is asked to breathe quietly only, and the bag, which was at first allowed to hang at right angles to the face-piece, is during tliree breaths raised till it is at Fig. 187.â€”Administration of ethyl-chloride from small bag of Clover's inhaler. (Bbiiiifcld's "Aiicrsthctics.") right angles to the face (Figs. 187 and 187a). After the third breath the face-piece is lifted off the face during one inspiration and closely reapplied to catch the expiration. Unconsciousness supervenes with remarkable rapidity and quietness. Children are often rmconscious after the second breath from the bag, and adults after four or five. The face is flushed, without any blueness. There may be no stertor, and the fixed position of the globes, with a dilated pupil and absence of conjunctival reflex, is the best indication of ansesthesia. The corneal reflex should not be abolished. When ansesthesia is reached the apparatus is removed.

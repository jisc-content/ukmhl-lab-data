90 THE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF BACTERIOLOGY By JOHN W. H. EYRE, M.D., M.S., F.R.S.Edin. The practical outcome of the observations-—outlined in the preceding- chapter—upon the life-history of bacteria in general and the causal relationsliip existing between certain of them and pathological con- ditions in the human subject, is that the surgeon of to-day has become possessed of information which not only enables him to diagnose with exactitude the micro-organism responsible for a bacterial infection, but also in many instances to neutralize the noxious action of that particular microbe by the production in his patient of a condition of either active or fassive immunity. In the first case, by the adminis- tration of a suitable vaccine he stimulates the tissue cells to elaborate a sufficiency of specific antibodies—opsonins, etc.—^to enable his patient successfully to combat the invading bacteria ; in the second case he attains the same end by introducing into his patient's economy a suitable serum containing a sufficiency of specific antibodies—anti- toxins, etc.—preformed in some other animal. Choice of method.—It has already been shown that bacteria exert their pathogenetic properties by reason of the toxins they elaborate, and, considered in this connexion, bacteria may be broadly divided into two groups. The first group comprises bacteria the toxin from which after its formation diffuses out of the bodies of the bacteria into solution in the fluid in which those bacteria are growing. Such a poison is spoken of as a soluble toxin ; it can be separated com- pletely from the body of the bacterium that manufactured it, and its toxicity accurately measured, and, by means already detailed, a specific antidote can be prepared—in the shape of antitoxin—in the serum of a suitable animal. Such an antitoxic serum can be readily employed for therapeutic purposes; and just as the toxicity of the soluble toxin used in immunizing the animal can be exactly measured, so the antitoxic value of the resulting serum can be mathematically expressed. In practice, antitoxic serums have proved of the very

TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS: MERCURY 759 p. 757), or of a mixture of aqueous solution with some tonic infusion. I cannot but condemn the practice, so common in England, of pre- scribing liquor hydrargyri perchloridi with potassium iodide for long periods. Owing to its insolubility the proto-iodide can only be used in the form of pills, either as Ricord's pill or as Fournier's modification : Proto-iodide of mercury, 5 eg. (gr. f.) ; extract of opium, 1 eg. (gr. -J). I think it unnecessary, however, to use pills containing opium as a routine measure. This drug has no curative action, and should be only added when required. The dosage requires adaptation to each individual case in order to secure full therapeutic effect combined with safety. Since no two cases tolerate mercury alike, dogmatic statements of the optimum dose are impossible. On the average, however, sublimate may be given in daily doses of J gr. for a man and J gr. for a woman ; whilst, as I have said, the dose of proto-iodide is 1^ gr. daily for a man and 1 gr. daily for a woman. A larger dose is required to aftect some syphilitic manifestations (e.g. cerebral syphilis) than to cause dis- appearance of others (e.g. roseola or any of the generalized syphilides). 2.

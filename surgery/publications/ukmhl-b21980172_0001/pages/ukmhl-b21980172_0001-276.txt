202 SUPPURATION patch in its centre, or the whole area may be the site of a large diffuse suppuration. Treatment calls for no special remark. Local fomentations and Bier's treatment may be considered, with vaccine- and serum- therapy as the case demands. In cases which do not suppurate, incisions have little, if any, effect in shortening the course of the disease, but where suppuration occurs they must be made freely. The type of hard, diffuse, brawny, swollen, oedematous, tender and painful inflammation, of which angina Ludovici is an example, is also met with in other parts. The B. cedematis maligni is a micro- organism which I have seen on two occasions affecting the lower limb in this manner ; both cases ended fatally and quickly.

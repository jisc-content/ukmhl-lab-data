CHORION-EPITHELIOMA 581 The tumour cells are markedly attracted towards the veins of the tissue which thej' infiltrate, and often form a layer beneath the endo- thelium, or a comjDlete tube around it. As a result of destruction of the endothelium, blood passes fi-eely into the tumour substance, breaking up the growth and causing extensive necrosis. The regional lymphatic glands are liable to invasion, and secondary deposits are also common in the vagina (Fig. 161) and vulva.

Owing to the extension of tlie tumour cells into the veins, metastases by way of the blood-stream are very frequent. They are most common in the lungs, but have also been met with in other parts such as the brain, kidneys, and subcutaneous tissue. In these parts the metastases form rounded nodules, usually varying in size from a pea to a walnut, and on section present a marljled red and yellowish-grey appearance owing to the presence of hai-morrhages. It is stated that after removal of the primary tumour the metastases have occasionally retrogressed and disappeared. In cases of chorion-epithelioma the ovaries have usually been found to be somewhat enlarged o^\^ng to the abundant production of lutein tissue, taking the form of luteal cysts. Carcinoma of the ovary is not unconnnon, and may probably originate in the germinal epithelium or in the epithelium of a Graafian follicle. Histologically the tumour may present alveoli

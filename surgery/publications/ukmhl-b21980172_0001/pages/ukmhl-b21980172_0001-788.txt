668 GENERAL ANESTHESIA operation to begin. Air is then admitted, by turning off the stopcock, until the stertor has subsided. Usually two or three breaths suffice. Gas is now readmitted by again closing tlie stopcock, and in this way, by giving regular breaths of air alternating with every four of nitrous- oxide, anaesthesia may be kept up as long as desired. The longer the administration lasts the shorter must the intervals be between the admissions of air. The anaes- thetist must be guided, however, by the patient's colour and his manner of re- spiration. Differeiit types of individual require different proportions of nitrous- oxide and of air. Thus, whereas muscu- lar, high-coloured, and alcoholic individuals must be scantily treated as regards air- admission, tliis must be freely practised and begun before stertor arises in the case of children and of the ansemic and the feeble. Intervals of apn«a not uncom- monly arise in the course of long nitrous- oxide inhalations. A stoppage of respira- tion in such circumstances must not alarm the anaesthetist. He must remove the face-piece, tilt up the chin, and, if respiration is not resumed, press the chest. Breathing will start again without any deleterious effects being produced. The condition is different from and without the dangers of that seen when respiration ceases during the inhalation of chloroform and other anaesthetics. For giving nitrous- oxide with definite percentages of oxygen the procedure is simi- lar to that described, but special apparatus (Fig. 18-5) is necessary. When the face-piece is applied and the patient is breathing satisfactorily through the mouth, the indicator is at once put to 2. The figures marked upon the metal mixing-chamber indicate the percentages of oxygen admitted by moving the indicator ; thus a Fig. 185.—Hewitt's apparatus for and oxygen." 'gas

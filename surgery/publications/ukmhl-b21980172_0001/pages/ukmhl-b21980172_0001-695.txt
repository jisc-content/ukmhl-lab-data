EXAMINATION OF THE BLOOD AND OF THE CEREBRO-SPINAL FLUID By J. M. BEATTIE, M.A., M.D. EXAMINATION OF THE BLOOD The surgeon cannot afford to dispense witli blood examination as an aid to diagnosis, but to him it is of much less value than to the physiciaji. For differential diagnosis, of course, he needs it. A case of tuberculosis may be closely simulated by a case of typhoid fever ; a case of pysemia may present the paroxysmal fever of malaria. Blood examination in such cases would not only be an aid to, but might definitely settle, the diagnosis. Therefore, without wishing to magnify the importance of blood examination, I hold that more accurate diag- noses might be made if it were more largely practised ; and if it were a routine practice with both surgeon and physician much valuable information would be obtained and there would be, at any rate, less dogmatism from the cytologist and less contempt for his observations from the surgeon. It is unnecessary here to deal with the blood pictures of pernicious anaemia, of the various forms of leukaemia, and of those other diseases in which the examination of the blood is the determining factor in the diagnosis. These diseases are for the physician, and though they not infrequently come undiagnosed to the surgeon, and, it may be, even remain for some time undiagnosed by him, they must be omitted from a purely surgical text-book. MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION For the surgeon, blood examination is almost synonymous with leucocyte-counting, for it is on this increase of the leucocytes that the surgeon may depend both for aid in his diagnosis and for help in determining the time for operation.

249 STERILIZATION and his assistants, should be of material tli\t admits of sterilization by heat. 3. The mucous membranes of the patiuit are. as a rule, to be considered infective, but it must be remembered tliat in a liealthy person the following parts are sterile :â€” i. The mucous membrane of the nose fud its accessory sinuses, except in the inferior meatus. ii. The middle ear and its adjacent cavities. iii. The stomach and duodenum, which in health cr.ntain practically no infective organisms. Those ingested are rapidly destroyed by the fi-ee HCl. iv. The urinary tract down to the liladdei'. tnd in men probably the bladder itself. V. The l3ody of the uterus and the Fallopian tuljes. which arc normally free from organisms, though the cervix is not. But since operations are, as a rule, performed on all these mucous membranes when in an unhealthy condition, they are for practical purposes to be considered as infective. 4. Instruments. 5. Lotions. 6. Dressings, sutures, ligatures, etc. 7. The air. Although in the early days of the Listerian procedure this was regarded as a frequent and dangerous source of infection, it is now proved that in the absence of draughts, dust, and particles of moisture, such as droplets of saliva expelled by talking, i-neezing or coughing, the atmosphere of the operating theatre does not convey pathogenetic organisms. In a well-regulated theatre, therefore, so few organisms gain entrance in this manner that they are negligible. METHODS OF STERILIZATION 1. Mechanical and solvent. Scrubbing, combined with the use of soaps, ether, tur- pentine, and other grease solvents. 2. Chemical. Antiseptic solutions and vapours. 3. Thermal. i. Dry heat : (a) Actual cautery. (b) Flames. (c) Hot air.

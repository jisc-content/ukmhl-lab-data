Diffuse lipoma is rarely met with except in fat persons of about middle age, and is much more common in men than in women. Roger Williams, in LSOO, was able to collect records of thirty-two cases of diffuse lipoma. Of these, all except one were men, and the relation of the disease to chronic alcoholism was brought out in a Fig. 43.â€”Diffuse lipoma of neck. {Ko^'er ll'iU.a///s^ Trans, Path, St'C, vol, xli.} considerable number of the cases, thus suggesting that these difluse, fatty growths are closely allied to the large deposits of fat met with in the abdomen and elsewhere in the bodies of drunkards.

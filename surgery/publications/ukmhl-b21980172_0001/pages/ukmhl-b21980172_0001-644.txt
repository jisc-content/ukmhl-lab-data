Precancerous conditions.—In view of the great frequency of cancer of the breast, it is not surprising that many investigators have sought for evidence of pathological conditions in the gland which Fig. 152.—Microscopic section of carcinoma simplex of breast (soft variety). might prove to stand in a causal relation to the malignant growth. The question chiefly discussed has been the relation between carcinoma and pre-existing chronic mastitis. Clinical evidence on this point is not very trustworthy, but not infrequently suggests that the car- cinoma has originated in a part of the gland already the seat of changes due to chronic inflammation. In chronic mastitis the glandidar epithe- lium usually presents evidences of atrophy in no way suggestive of a precancerous change. It is, however, not uncommon to find certain enlarged acini in the indurated parts of the breast in which the

348 TUMOURS By RAYMOND JOHNSON, M.B., B.S.Lond., F.R.C.S.Eng. AND T. W. P. LAWRENCE, M.B.Lond., F.R.C.S.Eng. Definition.â€”The name " tumour," as employed by the pathologist, is at the best a compromise, and attempts to frame a definition of a tumour which shall at once be sufficiently comprehensive and suffi- ciently exclusive have not hitherto been very successful. Indeed, a satisfactory definition is, in our present state of knowledge, impossible, because we are ignorant of the true nature of the pathological condi- tions which result in the growth of tumours, and are therefore com- pelled to describe them merely on the grounds of their histological structure and mode of growth. It may, however, be stated that a tumour, as generally understood, is a new formation of tissue, which originates without Icnown cause, continues to increase often without relation to the nutritive condition or growth of the part in which it hes, " comes to no physiological termination," and serves no useful purpose in the economy. Even such a general definition as this is open to criticism, for, to take a familiar instance, an ossifying cartilaginous tumour of a growing bone usually exliibits a period of growth which is to a marked degree determined by that of the bone from which it arises. It is, however, at once clear that every swelling is not a " tumour," and, further, it may be remarked that a tumour does not necessarily cause a swelling. The destruction of tissue occasioned by the growth of a tumour, together with changes in the tumour substance itself, may actually result in a diminution in the size of the affected part. For instance, a breast the seat of a cancerous growth is often smaller than the opposite healthy gland. In considering the many swellings which must be excluded from the class of true tumours, it will at once be obvious that the swelling, or " tumor" which forms one of the classical signs of acute inflamma-

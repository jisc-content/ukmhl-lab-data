TUMOURS 520 description of the disease, and the most important examples will be described as they occur in different situations. Extension of carcinoma.—The intimate relation existing between the cells of a carcinoma and the lymphatics has already been considered, and if the spreading edge of such a tumour is examined, it is sometimes possible to demonstrate the presence of the lymphatic endothelium around the epithelial cell-mass (Fig. 107); but this is not always so, and there is no doubt that the cells of the infiltrating growth can advance in the tissues in an altogether irregular manner. In Fig. 132 some of the groups of cancer cells are seen in the substance of the muscle-fibres. The spread of the gTowth occurs by continuous Fig. 132.—Microscopic section of muscle, showing invasion by car- cinoma.

The extension to the lym'phatic glands occurs either by a process of embolism or by direct permeation of the intervening lymphatic vessels by the cancer cells (Fig. 133). In exceptional cases an indurated cord, caused by the infiltrated lymphatics, can be traced continuously from the primary tumour to the enlarged glands. In the latter the cancer cells are arrested in the lymjih sinuses of the cortex ; and it is a matter of much practical importance that the invasion of the glands does not at first cause a palpable enlargement, even though the glands are in

WOUNDS OF SCALP AND SKULL 283 that have lodged in or near joints must be removed if they interfere in any way with movement. Wounds of the head are often fatal, and the after-efiects in cases that recover are frequently serious; Scalp wounds are of little importance, but must be very carefully examined to make sure that there is no injury to the underlying bone. Depressed fractures without penetration of the skull are rare, and are caused only by large or irregular pieces of shell, or occasionally by spent bullets. Rifle bullets striking the skull tangentially produce " gutter fractures," in which the bullet does not enter the cranial cavity but grooves the surface of the skull, the floor of the groove being broken up, the dura b Fig. 3,5.â€”Diagrammatic section of (ti) superficial and (/') deep perforating fracture of the skull. i^FrOTil the author s (riinshot ll'onnits.

Bullets that perforate the cranium may pass through it either superficially or deeply (Fig. 33). Superficial perfora- tions cause more damage to the cortex ; deep perforations are more dangerous, particularly if the base of the brain is traversed. In all perforations small fragments of bone are driven into the brain, especially at the entrance wound. They may be carried to a depth of an inch and a half or two inches. At short ranges the skull may be extensively fractured round the exit wound and the brain much disorganized, and at very short ranges considerable portions of the skull may be blown away and the sutures burst open. Such injuries are necessarily fatal. Fractures of the base of the skull are due to the direct violence of the bullet, and consequently do not follow the usual lines. In the middle or posterior fossa a fracture of the base is frequently accompanied by fatal injury to the brain. Lodgment

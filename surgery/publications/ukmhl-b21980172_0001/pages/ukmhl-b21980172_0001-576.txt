494 TUMOURS As a last means of diagnosis an exploratory incision into the doubtful swelling must be made. Situation.—Being a malignant connective-tissue grow^tli, a sarcoma may arise wherever connective tissue is present, and is thus almost unrestricted in its possible sites of origin. Certain situations are, however, especially liable, and it will be convenient to consider separately sarcomas as they occur- in the skin, subcutaneous tissues and fasciae, muscles, nerves, bones, mucous membranes and sub- mucous tissue, serous mem- branes and subserous tissue, and solid organs (the kidney, ovary, uterus, breast, etc.). Sarcoma of the skin usually occurs as the spindle- celled or fibro-sarcomatous forms, or as the variety of endothelial sarcoma known as alveolar sarcoma. Spindle- celled sarcoma or fibrosar- coma usually begins as a small, flattened, firm tumour on which the smooth epi- thelial layers are intimately adherent. As the tumour increases, secondary nodules, sometimes in considerable numbers, may develop around it, but the primary tumour itself rarely reaches a large size. Ulceration, if it occurs, only involves the surface of the growth. In this form of sarcoma the lymphatic glands are not usually invaded, and the maUgnancy of the tumour chiefly shows itself locally; recurrent nodules in the skin surrounding the cicatrix are likely to appear even after an apparently very free removal. Numerous cases of alveolar sarcoma of the skin are on record. The tumour begins as a firm nodule in the cutis, which steadily enlarges and soon ulcerates. In common with other forms of cutaneous sarcoma this variety also tends to be followed by secondary nodules m the surrounding skin, and Erichsen mentions a case in which twenty or more such tumours, varying in size from a pea to a walnut, were present Fig. 119.—Melanotic sarcoma of palm.

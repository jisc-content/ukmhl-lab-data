TUMOURS 414 the form of groups of small vesicles from wliicli a clear fluid escapes on puncture. Cavernous lymphangioma is represented by the not very un- common cystic tumour met with in the neck and elsewhere, and often known as the " cystic hygroma " (Fig. 74). The tumour is congenital, but, like other forms of angioma, often increases considerably after birth. It forms a lob- ulated mass, often of large size, and covered with normal sldn, through which the lymph - containing cysts appear of a bluish colour. It con- sists of a mass of cysts of varying size held together by connective tissue containing fat. The varying charac- ters of these tumours depend upon the size of the cysts and the amount of solid tissue present. The latter is found on microscopic examination to be in- tersected by dilated and cystic lymphatics. Sometimes one or more cysts may be of such a size as to form the bulk of even a large tumour. In some cases the tumour has a mixed structure, being partly hfemangiomatous and partly lymph- angiomatous. The limitation of these cystic tumours is usually ill- defined, and the lymphatic growth may extend among the muscles and other deep structures. This fact is of great importance in con- sidering the question of operation, for, although excision has been successfully practised, it is hardly likely to be complete, and the operation may be accompanied by very fi'ee bleeding. Hutchinson was, we believe, the first to point out that these tumours are liable to recurrent attacks of inflammation. During these attacks the tumour increases in size, the overlying skin becomes reddened, and Fig. 74.- -Cavernous lymphangiomas of neck and chest-wall. {T. Sniitli^ Trans. C/ln.

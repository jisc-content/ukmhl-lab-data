864 GRANULOMA OF THE PUDENDA In the superficial layers numerous organisms may be found. The deeper parts are sterile as regards bacilli, but Wise has found spiro- chsetes closely resembling *S. follida. The situation in the neighbour- hood of the genitalia and the different distribution in the two sexes are highly suggestive of a venereal origin, but antisyphilitic treatment is, as a rule, of no value. Clinical characteristics.—When the disease occurs on the skin the fibrous mass can be felt underneath the superficial part of the growth, which shows through the subjacent non-pigmented and translucent, though thickened, skin as a red granulomatous mass. Fig. 237.—Granuloma of the pudenda in the male. (Frtvii Malison's " Tiopical Diseases," 4tli edit.) Secondary superficial ulceration of the skin may occur, for the imperfect keratinization and sodden condition of the epithelium render it specially vulnerable. When the disease affects the mucous surfaces, ulceration takes place earlier and may extend deeply. The disease runs a chronic course and does not directly affect the general health. Spontaneous cure by the complete conversion of the growth into dense fibrous tissue takes place but rarely. More commonly cicatrization occurs in parts, especially near the centre, whilst slow extension, by continuity or by auto-inoculation, goes on else- where along the moist folds of the skin. The rate of spread is variable, but the extension may continue for years. The first appearance is usually on the glans or the sldn of the penis, and in the female on the labia. The growth extends rapidly on the glans or on the mucous aspect of the labia, but very slowly on the sldn. It may remain

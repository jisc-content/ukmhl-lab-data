541 CARCINOMA OF THE JAWS demonstrated the epithelial nature of the growth, and the origin of the cysts by changes in the epithelial masses, and regarded the tumour as originating in the gum. In 1885, Malassez publislied his observations on the remains of paradental epithelium in the adult jaw (p. -^'-'S), and thus the origin of an epithelial tumour can be explained indepen- dently of the epithelium of the gum. This view of the origin of the Fig. 144.â€”Microscopic section of cystic epithelial tumour of cystic epithelial tumour now under discussion is usually adopted, and accordingly the name " epithelial odontome " is sometimes applied to it (p. :m). The tumour usually occurs in young adults, and pursues a slowly progressive course often extending to many years. There is, however, reason to believe that it is not entirely benign in its nature, and is rightly regarded as a cystic carcinoma. In a remarkable case recorded by Christopher Heath, numerous operations had been performed during a period of thirty-five years for a cystic tumour of this nature, which

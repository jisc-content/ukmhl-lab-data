GRANULOMA OF THE PUDENDA S65 limited for years to these situations. Frequently, however, other growtlis appear in parts where the sldu is usually soft and moist, and that are much in contact with the tip of the penis or with dis- charges from the labia. In the male, therefore, the growths are usually found on the inner aspect of the groin or lower part of the abdomen (Fig. 237), and extend along the folds of the groin and the fold between the thigh and the scrotum. In old-standing cases they may spread over the perineum and round the anus to the tip of the coccyx. In the female the main extension is backwards on the perineum, but sometimes, though more rarely, between the labia majora and the Fig. 238.â€”Granuloma of the pudenda in the female.

The growths, owing to the translucency of the skin, are red and are often mistaken for ulcers. Though there are no sweat-glands in the older growths, there is usually a profuse watery discharge, which may be very offensive. The granuloma is not painful. Extension up the mucous surfaces readily takes place, and causes serious trouble. The disease extends only a short distance up the urethra, but causes there a stricture of the meatus, which contracts rapidly after dilatation. It passes some inches up the rectum and there gives rise to a true ulceration of the mucosa and a cicatricial narrowing. In the female it rapidly spreads up the vagina and gives rise to a chronic leucorrhoea. It does not invade the uterus. When, as fre- quently happens, both rectum and vagina are invaded, the septum often breaks down and incurable recto-vaginal fistuke are formed, 3 ^

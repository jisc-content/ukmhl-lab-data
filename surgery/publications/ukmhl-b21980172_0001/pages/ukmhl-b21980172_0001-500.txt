TUMOURS 420 An endothelioma of the parotid region generally presents itself as a circumscribed, lobulated, slowly growing tumour, which usually lies superficially to some part of the parotid gland, often immediately below the lobule of the ear. The tumour may reach a very large size without showing any evidence of malignancy (Fig. 81). On section the tumour varies much in appearance, according to the •A, "~ Fig. 80.—Microscopic section of chondro-endothelioma of lower lip. relative proportions of the different tissue elements composing it. It may be firm and fibrous, soft and fleshy, gelatinous, or, if cartilage is abundant, bluish-grey and semitranslucent, like a pure chondroma.

Tumours in all respects similar to the parotid tumours are occasionally met with in the submaxillary region. The tumour of

136 THE CLINICAL COURSE AND TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION By MAYNARD SMITH, M.B„ B.S., F.R.C.S. The causation and the pathology of inflammation having been dis- cussed in detail in the preceding article, it is intended now to view the phenomena of inflammation from the clinical standpoint ; to show by what local and constitutional signs and symptoms the sur- geon is enabled to infer the presence of the various pathological pro- cesses which constitute inflammation ; to point out how these processes may terminate ; and, Anally, to discuss the means which the surgeon has at liis disposal to restore the inflamed parts to their normal condition. As pathologically, so also clinically, acute and chronic inflammation are so far removed in their manifestations that they need separate consideration. ACUTE INFLAMMATION Local symptoms.—The local signs of acute inflammation can be grouped under Ave headings : 1. Kedness. 4. Pain. 2. Swelling. 5. Interference with function. 3. Heat. The first four of these have from time immemorial been looked upon as the cardinal signs of inflammation ; they are the " rubor et tumor cum colore et dolore " of Celsus. 1. Redness.'—This is due to the increased amount of blood present in the vessels of the inflamed area. In the earlier stages there is a bright red blush of the skin, disappearing with the pressure of the finger and rapidly returning as the pressure is removed. After a little time it is found that while the colour disappears, on removal of the pressure it returns but slowly : the vessels of the part are dilated, but the blood-flow through them is slow. At the same time the decreased rate of blood-flow leads to less perfect oxygenation of the blood in the region of inflammation, and the colour changes from a bright to a dusky red. Later, the colour becomes still darker and assumes a purplish tint; pressure with the finger no longer empties

866 GRANULOMA OF THE PUDENDA Beyond the inconvenience, little trouble is caused unless the mucous surfaces are implicated. Differential diagnosis. â€” When the disease is limited to the genitalia it requires careful diagnosis from malignant disease or tertiary syphilides, from which it may be difEerentiated by micro- scopical examination. When it occurs in the groin or on the perineum it must again be distinguished from the same diseases, and also from lupus. All forms of destructive ulceration can readily be excluded. Prognosis is favourable as regards life and general health. Spon- taneous cure by cicatrization occurs, but is rare. Large doses of potassium iodide in a few cases seem to aid the tendency to cica- trization. Where active treatment is impossible, recovery from the local conditions is exceptional. Treatment by drugs is of little or no value. Mercury and arsenic are useless, but occasionally potassium iodide, gr. xx-xxx three times a day, appears to have a slightly beneficial effect. If complete excision of the growth and underlying sclerotic tissue be possible, it is effective. Scraping is of value, but usually there is recurrence from portions of the growth left in the dense fibrous tissue. If scraping be combined Avith escharotics tlie probability of recurrence is slightly less. Treatment by X-rays followed by scraping has in one case proved highly successful. The stricture of the urethra can be treated by amputation of the glans. For the recto-vaginal fistulse, only palliative treatment is possible.

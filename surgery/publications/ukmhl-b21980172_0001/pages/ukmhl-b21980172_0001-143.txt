decUned, sometimes within twelve hours (Fig. 8). ACTIVE IMMUNIZATION BY VACCINES loi the otlier hand, a second dose injected at the highest point of the positive phase will not in most instances give rise to cumulation of positive phases. Usually such a procedure merely results in a shorter or less marked negative phase (Fig. -5). In some infections, e.g. those due to the gonococcus and tlie Bacillus coli, this highly desirable end can be obtained (Fig. 6). Practically it is found that good clinical Fig. 5.—Opsonic index, showing Fig. tl.—Opsonic index, showing less marked negative phase. cumulation of positive phases. results are obtained if the index oscillates about the normal level, provided that the greater part of the curve representing the move- ments of the index is above normal (Fig. 7). Consequently, to obtain the best results by the aid of vaccines, subsequent doses should be injected towards the end of the period of equilibrium. Endeavour should be made so to adjust the dose as to obtain the shortest negative Fig. 7.-- Opsonic index, showing oscil- Fig. S.—Opsonic index, show- lation about normal level. ing immediate appearance of positive phase. phase compatible with, the production of a ])ositive phase lasting for five to seven days. In many acute infections, however, it is of greater importance to reduce or eliminate the negative phase which follows the injections than to lengthen the positive phase, and in such cases a dose must be administered so minute that the positive phase appears almost imme- diately, and nuist be repeated before the transient positive phase has

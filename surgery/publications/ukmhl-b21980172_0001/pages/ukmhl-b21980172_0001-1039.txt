URINARY BILHARZIOSIS 901 The diagnosis of billiarziosis must be suspected in every case of irritable bladder and haematuria in a bilharzia-infected country, and is confirmed by microscopical examination of the urine. The cysto- scope may reveal the earlier manifestations or show small papillomas occluding the orifices of the ureters ; but as the surface of the mucous membrane becomes abraded the difficulty of securing a clear medium, owing to the constant drip of blood and the presence of debris, makes it necessary to depend upon other diagnostic methods. Thus, with the sound a roughened bladder-wall, masses of raised plateaux or papil- Fig. 242.—Extreme case of bilharziosis of the bladder with formation of much dense scirrhus-like tissue.

The urine varies considerably. It contains ova throughout; in the earlier stages it may remain acid and otherwise normal except for the presence of ova and of traces of blood ; later it is alkaline and full of pus, blood, phosphates, debris, and ova. Treatment.—The intravascular parasites are inaccessible ; thus, treatment is directed to palliating the effects of the lesions, encouraging elimination of the ova, and preventing re-infection. If possible, there- fore, the patient should be placed beyond reach of fresh infection, r—

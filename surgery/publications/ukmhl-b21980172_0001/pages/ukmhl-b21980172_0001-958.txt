Often the only sign of a chronic urethritis is the pre- sence of a few urethral threads floating in the urine first passed in the morning, the secretion in such cases being too shght and tenacious to appear at the meatus as the " bon- jour drop." Should the inflammation extend to the tissues beneath the mucous membrane, other and more serious symptoms are likely to de- velop ; for, as the small-celled infil- tration gradually midergoes cicatricial contraction, the lumen of the urethra is diminished, and the symptoms of a stricture are added to those de- scribed above. Should the deeper structures of the posterior urethra become involved, distressing urinary, sexual and general nervous symptoms will be evoked in consequence of the irritation of that highly nervous organ, the prostate. Examination.â€” Before treat- ment is begun the establishment of an exact diagnosis is essential. We must loiow not only whether the urethra is inflamed or not, but whether or not the gonococcus is still present. Are other micro-organisms present in the secretion, and if so, what is their nature ? Where is the inflam- mation situated, in the anterior or the posterior urethra ? Is the in- flammation limited to the mucous membrane, or has it extended to the deeper structures ? Is there any diminution of the calibre of the ure- thra ? Has the inflammation spread to other organs, such as the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, etc. ? To answer these questions a full and systematic examination of the patient is necessary. The steps of the bacteriological examination and the method of determining whether the inflammation affects the anterior or the posterior urethra have been treated above, in connexion with the diagnosis of acute urethritis.

TUMOURS 530 the lymphatic glands, or to recur after removal. It has been suggested that it may arise in the sebaceous glands. In the neck it occasionally happens that a hard, deeply seated tumour, clearly not originating in the skin, proves to present the structure of a squamous carcinoma. In such cases it is most probable that a small primary growth in some part of the mucous membrane of the throat or elsewhere has escaped detection, and that the tumour of the neck is a secondary glandular deposit. We have met with two cases of this nature in which it appeared probable that a secondary carcinoma in the lymphatic glands of the neck had resulted from a primary growth on the lip that had healed spontaneously. In one of Fig. 137.â€”Microscopic section of rodent carcinoma. these cases, that of a man under the care of Christopher Heath, the tumour, wliich formed a hard mass below the jaw, proved after excision to be a squamous carcinoma, and there was a history of a small ulcer on the lip which had healed after cauterization, leaving a small scar. In the other case, a small sore on the lip which healed spontaneously was followed by the growth of a large tumour on the same side of the neck, which soon ulcerated and proved fatal. Mention must also be made of cases in which a deeply seated cystic tumour of the neck presents, in the solid tissue composing its wall the structure of a carcinoma, usually of the squamous-celled type. Since Volkmann first called attention to such tumours in 1882, numerous

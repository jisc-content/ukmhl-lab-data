DESTRUCTION OF THE SPIROCH/ETE 777 of cases it seems to have little or no influence at first. In the great majority of these, however, a second injection produces the desired result. That these results are due to destruction of the specific parasite of the disease is shown (1) by the prompt disappearance of treponemata from local lesions in which they abounded previouslv to the injection, the disappearance taking place in forty-eight hours at t]\e latest ; and (2) by its effect on the Wassermann reaction. With regard to the latter, our observations, carried out for six weeks or more on HI cases wliich previously to the injection gave a positive reaction to the original Fig. 198.—Malignant ulceration before injection of salvarsan and ten days afterwards. The same case as in Fig. 197. {Fiv,:r tJu- Journal of the R.A.M.C.) test, or Stern's modification, or both, showed that in 90 the reaction became completely negative to both tests. Speaking generally, the •conversion to negative occurs in four to six weeks. It is also claimed, as evidence of the wholesale destruction of treponemata. that large ■amounts of syphilitic antibody are formed. This is shown l^y the ■curative effect exercised by the serum of patients treated with salvarsan when it is injected into other syphilitics, as well as l>y the fact that if the mother of a sypliilitic infant be treated with salvarsan ■and nurses the cluld, the latter at once begins to improve in health and its lesions disappear, though no arsenic can be detected in the milk; and, in any case salvarsan has little or no effect wlien adminis- tered by mouth.

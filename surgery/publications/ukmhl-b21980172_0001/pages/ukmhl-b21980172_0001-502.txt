422 TUMOURS closely to resemble the cell nests whicli occur in squanaous carcinomas. Psammomas are usually of small size, and may be single or multiple. They &XCj clS cl rule, unproductive of symptoms, but occasionally, especially in the spinal cord, they cause pressure effects, and have been removed by operation. In the brain they are most common in the neighbourhood of the flocculus. Endotheliomas are also described in the tongue, uterus, testicle J' Fig. 82.-â€”Microscopic section of endothelioma of neck. {Nt'iv SydcuJtain Society's Atlas, _/asc. .wiii.) and ovary, but many tumours in these and other situations, such as the bones, should be regarded rather as endothelial sarcomas. LYMPHOMA The name lymphoma was formerly understood to indicate a tumour composed of lymphoid tissue. Increasing knowledge of the group of diseases in which various forms of overgrowth affect the lymphatic glands and other parts in which lymphoid tissue is normally present seems clearly to show that such overgrowths can no longer be regarded as true tumour formations, but rather as hyperplasias, or in some cases as granulomas, probably infective in nature. It is indeed doubtful whether a true lymphoma, as formerly defined, really exists. From the clinical side, however, this subject is one presenting considerable difficulty, by reason of the fact that such a glandular overgrowth, when strictly limited to one particular site, may present many of the features of a true tumour, and also because the super- vention of malignant growths of a sarcomatous type upon a glandular hyperplasia is occasionally observed. It not uncommonly happens

RENAL RADIOGRAMS 625 relationsliip of the ureters and both Iddneys as demonstrated in this experiment. The circles a and b represent the pelves of the kidneys, and the straight lines the line of the ureters. The position of the patient is also of some importance (Fig. 173) ; he is j^laced. lying face downwards, with his arms by his sides, on a canvas-topped couch, under whicli the tube is arranged ; and in order to restrict as far as possible the move- ments of the diaphragm, -.oiigll^^^^H and consecjuently of the kidneys, a pad or com- pressor is placed under the abdomen, with the whole weight of the patient rest- ing upon it. The com- pressor pad (composed of pure wool wound into a ball, about 8 inches wide and 5^ inches deep, of the shape illustrated in Fig. 174) pushes the abdominal contents away from the renal region, and per- mits more perfect illumination of these parts. It is often diffi- cult to secure a radiogram of good quality — firstly, on account of the density, and. secondly, because of the vagaries, of the patient. With regard to the first difficulty, stout people of considerable mus- pig. 174.—Compressor pad for use in X-ray cular development examination of renal region.

COLUMNAR-CELLED CARCINOMA 51" In another very common variety of carcinoma the cancer cells retain more or less markedly the columnar or cubical shape of tlie epithelial cells in which the tumour arises, constituting the form known as columnar-celled carcinoma. In this variety the shape and arrangement of the normal epithelium may be so completely reproduced Fig. 130.â€”Microscopic section of squamous-celled carcinoma of skin. that in place of the solid cell-columns of the carcinoma simplex the cell elements are arranged in a single layer of columnar or cubical cells around a central lumen (Figs. 1-31, 14(3). Often, however, in this columnar type of carcinoma the specialized form of the cells is only imjjerfectly preserved, and a tumour undoubtedly arising in a columnar or cubical epithelium may assume the characters of the simple undifferentiated form described above. It often happens, therefore, in the histological examination of a carcinomatous tumour presenting chiefly the structure

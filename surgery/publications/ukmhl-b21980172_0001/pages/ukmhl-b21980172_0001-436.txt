TUMOURS 358 its rounded edge can be felt distinctly to slip away from under the finger. Not infrequently tlie skin over the tumour is slightly dimpled at one or more points, or, if this is not so, the dimpling can often be produced by grasping the tumour and pressing it up so as to stretch the skin over it. The dimples are caused by the slight traction exer- cised on the skin by the fibrous bands passing from the cutis to the capsule of the tumour between the lobules. After reaching a certain size, a fatty tumour often remains stationary, and does not ne- cessarily shrink as the result of general wasting. Occa- sionally such a tumour may, without apparent cause, take on a very rapid growth and reach a large size even in a few weeks. A fatty tumour is rarely productive of any symptoms, except such as may result from its size or position. Sometimes, however, especi- ally in women, it may be the seat of a varying amount of pain. In some situations, such as the shoulder and back, a fatty tumour may gradually shift its position under the influence of gravity, and from the same cause the tumour sometimes becomes peduncu- lated (Fig. 42). A superficial lobule of the tumour occasionally projects through the capsule, and, covered by the thinned skin, forms, as it were, a pedunculated appendage to the main tumour. The diagnosis of a subcutaneous lipoma is rarely attended with difficulty. On account, however, of its very soft consistence, it may be mistaken for a fluid swelling, especially a chronic abscess or a sebaceous cyst. The most characteristic features, which usually serve to distinguish a lipoma, are its distinct lobulation and the pre- sence of a definite rounded border, which slips from under the exam- ining finger. When the edge of an entirely fluid swelling is examined in this way the fluid is displaced, and no definite border is palpable. Fig. 41.â€”Lipoma of neck. The lobu- lation of the tumour can be seen.

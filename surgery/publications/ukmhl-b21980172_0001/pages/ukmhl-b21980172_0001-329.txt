THE SURGEON'S CLOTHING PREPARATION OF THE SURGEON AND HIS ASSISTANTS Clothing.—Tlie surgeon and his assistants should be enveloped in overalls of light material suitable for repeated sterilization by steam. These should reach from the chin to the feet, and be provided with long sleeves capable of being tucked into the wists of rubber gloves. Fig. 16.—High-pressure steam sterilizer (end and side views). For operations involving the spilling of nuich fluid it is advisable to wear a light sterilizable mackintosh apron imder the overall. The use of linen caps prevents the possibility of infection by falling hairs or epidermic scales which may be knocked off by contact with the assistant. Although the air expired by a healthy individual in ordi- nary respiration is not a source of danger, it has been proved that coughing, sneezing, or even talking expels particles of moisture laden with bacteria. Therefore, unless the surgeon can guarantee silence, it is advisable that he and his assistants should wear masks. This

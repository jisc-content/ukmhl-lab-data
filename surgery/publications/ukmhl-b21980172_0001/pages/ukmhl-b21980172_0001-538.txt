456 TUMOURS secondary deposits especially in the lungs, whilst in the case of a car- cinoma of the skin of the leg the first evidence of dissemination is likely to be found in the lymphatic glands of the groin. Attempts to discover any histological feature by which the cells of malignant growths can be distinguished from those of simple tumours and other pathological conditions have not hitherto been successful. Recently, however, Beckton, worldng in the Cancer Research Labora- tories of the Middlesex Hospital, has drawn attention to a histological fact which, if established, will be of very great value in diagnosis. Fig. 106.—Microscopic section of spindle-celled sarcoma, showing a blood-space, the endothelium of which lies in contact with the tumour cells. It has been shown that in most normal tissues certain granules, known as "Altmann's granules," can be demonstrated in the protoplasm of the cells by a special method of fixation and staining. Beckton has investigated the condition of these granules in various forms of inflam- mation and new growth, and states that, whereas in inflammation and simple tumours the granules are present, in the cells of malignant growths, whether sarcoma or carcinoma, they are either entirely absent or greatly reduced in number. The tendency of the granules to be present in the cells of the stroma of the carcinomas is of interest in relation to the generally accepted view that in such tumours the stroma is not an essential part of the growth. The subject is a very important one, and calls for careful consideration. Evidence of malignancy.—The mahgnancy of a tumour may be manifested locally and generally—locally by its destructive action

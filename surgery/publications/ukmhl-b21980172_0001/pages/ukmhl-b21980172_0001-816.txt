696 SPINAL ANALGESIA a good one : the solution tends to sink to the lower end of the theca and remain there. Further, the amoimt of movement required to place the patient in the supine position, after injection, appears to affect the even flow of the solution towards the dorsal region, and this frequently interferes with the evenness and completeness of the analgesia. The lateral position, although more awkward for the surgeon, gives the best results. Determination of dosage.—Only a general indication of the dosage can be given here, as much depends on the age, weight, and condition of the individual. The usual dose, however, may be taken as Fig. 194.—Showing {«) use of cannula, and (6) accidental loss of analgesia which it is designed to prevent. that which will suffice for the performance of a hernial operation in a healthy male adult. For this purpose— The dose of tropacocaine may be 0"05 to 0'06 grm. (1-2 c.c. of 5 per cent, solution). ,, ,, alypin ,, ,, 1 to 2 c.c. of a 2 per cent, solution. ,, ,, stovaine ,, ,, 0'05 to 0*06 grm. ,, ,, novocaine ,, ,, 2 to 3 c.c. of a 5 per cent, solution. It must be remembered that patients may exliibit an idiosyncrasy for the drug ; that perineal operations require the smallest, and epigastric the largest closes. It should be the rule never to give larger initial doses than are necessary. Landmarks for injection.—The .site of puncture should be strictly in the middle line of the back, any of the four lumbar inter- spaces being chosen, that between the second and third spines being the most convenient. According to Tufher, a line drawn transversely between the highest points of the iliac crests crosses the fourth lumbar spine ; the level of this line is liable to slight variation owing to differ- ences in the width of the pelvis and the development of the inter- vertebral discs. The matter is not of importance, since the lumbar

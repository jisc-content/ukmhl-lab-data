538 TUMOURS groups the lymphatics pass to the chain of glands which lie over the large vessels, especially those on the internal jugular vein between the digastric above and the omo-hyoid below. Treatment.—The ideal operation for carcinoma of the tongue, as planned by Butlin, consists in removal of the small lesion of the mucous membrane by incisions so arranged that the edges of the wound can be brought together by suture. The diseased tissue is carefully microscoped, and if it prove to be cancerous a subsequent operation is performed for the removal of the glands liable to be involved (Fig. 142). This consists in a free dissection of the anterior triangle of Fig. 142.—Microscopic section through edge of small carcinomatous ulcer of tongue, showing irregular downgrowth of epithelial cells into the tissues beneath the floor of the ulcer. the neck, with removal of the fascia, fat, submaxillary salivary gland and lymphatic glands. If the disease of the tongue extends to the middle line, both anterior triangles must be similarly treated, and if the glands of the parotid region or beneath the sterno-mastoid are extensively involved, the contents of the posterior triangle should also be removed. Carcinoma of the jaws is represented by three distinct forms of tumour : 1, carcinoma of the mucous membrane of the gums or hard palate ; 2, carcinoma of the mucous membrane lining the maxillary antrum ; and 3, a rare form of epithelial growth, usually cystic, arising in the interior of the mandible. 1. Carcinoma beginning in the mucous membrane of the gums or hard palate is usually of the well-marked squamous-celled variety, and, on account of the close connexion of the mucous membrane with

512 THE INTESTINES. The septum may be made to atrophy by the pressure of an india-rubber tube introduced so that one end is in the afferent and the other in the efferent limb of the segment of bowel concerned, or it may be mechanically compressed and divided by a screw clamp, known as an enterotome. More frequently re- course is to be had to some such. operative measure as that suggested by John Duncan in 1873, which consists in separating by dissec- tion the adherent edges of bowel and abdominal parietes, and stitching like to like. The mucous membrane is dissected up all round the ab- normal orifice; it is MCSO-COLON Fig. 140.—Formation of Artificial Anus in Pelvic Colon. First stage—tile bowel is drawn out at the wound. then invaginated, and series of interrupted the raw surfaces stitched together by a catgut sutures; the margins of the skin are next pared and brought together by sutures. Artificial Anus.—This is an opening made in the bowel for therapeutic purposes. In the anus that is made in the pelvic colon to relieve symp- toms in cancer of the rectum, the usual ar- rangement is that of two parallel tubes of bowel opening freely on the surface with a septum or spur be- tween them (Fig. 141). The edges of the opening in the bowel fuse with the edges of the surround- ing skin, and the sep- tum serves to divert the intestinal contents out at the opening. When an artificial anus has been made in the small intestine, the opening in the bowel is a comparatively small one, and, provided there be no Fig. 141.—Completed Artificial Anus in Pelvic Colon. The edges of the bowel after being opened have become retracted, and united with the margins of the wound in the parietes.

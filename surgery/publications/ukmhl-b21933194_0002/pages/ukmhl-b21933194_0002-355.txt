The tissues immediately surrounding the tumour are usually infiltrated with leucocytes. On a section being made through the tumour there is a characteristic creaking sensation as the knife divides the tissue, and thecut surfaces become slightly concave owing to contraction of the dense fibrous tissue in the centre of the growth. Towards the centre, the section presents a greyish- white, striated appearance, closely re sembling that of an unripe pear, and scattered over it there are usually several yellow spots due to fatty degeneration of the epi- thelial elements. Towards the periphery the tissue is softer, of a bluish or pinkish colour, and shows numerous m inute haemorrhagic points.

THE PANCREAS AND SPLEEN. 546 Fig. 147.—Pancreatic Cyst between Stomach and Colon, and covered in front by Gastro- colic Omentum. usually the result of some antecedent disease of the gland. The view formerly held that they are of the nature of retention cysts due to blocking of the main duct has little to support it, although it cannot altogether be excluded. Cyst formation in the pancreas may follow upon inflammatory changes, especially such as involve the smaller ducts, upon necrosis of the glandular tissue, hcemorrhage into its substance, or changes brought about by in- jury. Shreds of nec- rosed pancreatic tissue are sometimes found within the cyst, and support the view that cyst formation may result from pancreatitis. A small number are of the nature of new growths, chiefly cyst-adenomata. The true cysts may be uni- or multilocular, and are usually located in the head or in the tail of the gland. They may attain the size of a child’s head, and the contents are usually turbid, often mixed with blood, and occa- sionally they exhibit certain of the digestive properties of pancreatic juice. False cysts or accu- mulations in the lesser sac of the peritoneum usually follow upon a blow or crush of the upper part of the ab- domen. They may de- velop within a few days of the injury, or not until after the lapse of some months. Fig. 148.—Pancreatic Cyst between Liver and Stomach, and covered in front by Gastro- hepatic Omentum.

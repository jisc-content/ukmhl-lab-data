The treatvient consists in removing the cause when this can be discovered, improving the general health of the patient, applying soothing applications during the attacks, and wearing a suspensory bandage. It is only in extreme cases, which have resisted all other treatment, that the testis should be removed. Atrophy of one or both testes may result from injury of the gland, or from inflammatory conditions following gonorrhoea, syphilis, mumps, typhoid, or other infective diseases. Sometimes the testis on the same side as a hernia is much smaller than its fellow. Atrophy may also occur when the vascular or nerve supply of the organ is interfered with in any way, as for example in severe injuries of the spermatic cord, and it is especially liable to occur if the vas is divided or ruptured. The glandular elements de- generate and the stroma shrivels up, and the body of the organ is merely repre- sented by a small nodule of connective tissue. The epi- didymis and the structures of the cord may share in the atrophic process, but as a rule the epididymis remains palpable behind the remains < a Fig. 198.—Atrophy of body of right Testis (a). intact (Fig. 198) and is distinctly f the testis. The Tunica Vaginalis. Hydeocele.—The term hydrocele is used somewhat loosely to indicate a collection of fluid in relation to the testis, its appendages, or its coverings. In a more restricted sense it refers to a collection of serous fluid in the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. Acute Hydrocele.—This term is applied to the serous effusion which takes place into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis in the course of inflammatory conditions of the testis and epididymis, and after injuries of these organs. The fluid is an ordinary

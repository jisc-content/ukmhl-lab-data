84 DISEASES OF THE CRANIAL BONES. Tumours.—Osteoma of the skull has been described with diseases of bone (vol. i. p. 621). Sarcoma.—All forms of sarcoma are met with implicating the bones of the skull. They may originate in the pericranium, in the diploe, or in the dura mater. The tumour grows chiefly towards the surface, but it also tends to involve the dura mater and to invade the cranial cavity, and may thus assume the shape of a dumb-bell. Its growth is usually rapid, and results in the formation of a diffuse soft swelling, which sometimes pulsates, and which sooner or later fungates through .the skin. On account of its rapid growth the tumour is liable to be mistaken for an abscess, and in some cases a diagnosis is only arrived at after making an exploratory incision, and finding that the finger passes through a softened area in the bone. When the cranial cavity is encroached upon, signs of com- pression may ensue. After the tumour has fungated, septic complications within the skull are liable to develop. In all cases the prognosis is extremely unfavourable. If diagnosed sufficiently early, an attempt may be made to remove the tumour, but often the operation has to be abandoned. The bones of the skull may become the seat of secondary growths, by the direct spread of cancer from the soft parts, or by metastasis of cancer or sarcoma from distant parts of the body.

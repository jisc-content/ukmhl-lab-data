PROLAPSE. 603 other condition that induces severe straining, prolapse of the bowel is very liable to develop. The violent muscular efforts caused by whooping-cough or bronchitis may also determine the protrusion of the bowel in a weakly child. The condition has also been attributed to the pernicious habit of allowing the child to sit at stool after the bowel has been emptied. In children the prolapse is, as a rule, of the partial or incomplete variety. In adults the cause of the condition is often obscure, but loss of fat and muscular weakness may predispose to the produc- tion of prolapse, which may be determined by such causes of straining as constipation, piles, rectal polypus, vesical calculus, or enlarged pros- tate. In adults the pro- lapse is usually of the complete variety. In women it is nearly always associated with prolapse of the vagina, bladder, and uterus, and is due to weak- ness of the pelvic floor. Clinical Features. â€” In the early stages the condition consists merely in an exaggeration of the normal protrusion of the anal mucous membrane that accompanies the final expulsive effort of the bowel in defecation. This gradually increases until the prolapse forms a conical projection, which varies in length from two to five or six inches. The mucous membrane of the protruded portion shows a series of circular or crescentic folds, and is at first of a pink or bright red colour, but, if it remains out for some time and is grasped by the sphincter, it assumes a bluish or purplish hue. At the apex of the cone is found the lumen of the bowel, while at its base the mucous membrane becomes continuous with the skin around the anal orifice. At first the protrusion can be readily returned inside the anus, but it tends to reappear if the patient coughs or strains, or, in some cases, even if she stands up. As the prolapse

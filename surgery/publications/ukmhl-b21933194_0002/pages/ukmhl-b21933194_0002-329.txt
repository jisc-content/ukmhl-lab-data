EMPYEMA. 309 Two large-sized rubber tubes are introduced side by side so that they project about a quarter of an inch within the parietal pleura ; only that portion of each tube which projects within the pleural cavity should be perforated, so that the pus is carried past the wound in the parietes without contaminating it unduly. The advantage of two tubes is that the risk of blockage is diminished, and that, at the subsequent dressings, one tube can be removed at a time, the other keeping the wound open and facilitating reintroduction. The outer end of each tube should be transfixed with a large safety-pin to prevent its being sucked into the pleura during inspiration. Hogarth Pringle recommends Fig. 84.â€”Patient using Spirometer after operation for empyema, as suggested by Dr. Alexander James. that if the lung does not show signs of expanding with the first few coughing efforts, the adhesions between the two pleural surfaces should be freely separated with the finger or with an instrument, more ribs being resected if necessary to permit of the adhesions being reached. During the after-treatment the patient should lie on the affected side as much as possible to promote the escape of the discharge. To prevent the suction of air into the pleural cavity, the end of the tube should be covered with a piece of oiled-silk protective, which acts as a valve; or a syphon, or valvular tube may be employed. The expansion of the lung should be further encouraged by breathing exercises, or by the use of simple

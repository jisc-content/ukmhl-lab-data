THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 354 tissue which develops as a result of inflammatory changes subse- quent to separation of the stump of the cord. It is to be differ- entiated from the entero-teratoma above described, and should be removed with the scissors. Umbilical Fistulse of other than Congenital Origin.—Ab- dominal abscesses may point and rupture in the situation of the umbilical scar. The discharge is at first purulent, but may become mixed with bile, feces or urine, according to the origin of the abscess. Biliary Jistulce usually follow upon the inflam- matory complications of gall-stones; urinary jistulce follow on prevesical cellulitis and abscess, and resemble those associated with a persistent urachus. Faecal jistulce result from various conditions, such as strangulated umbilical hernia, foreign bodies and ulcers of the intestine, and particularly abdominal tuber- culosis. Tumours of the Umbilicus. — These include dermoids, papillomata, fibromata, sarcomata, and cancers. The primary cancer, usually a squamous epithelioma, results from long- continued irritation, and appears as an indurated ulcer with offensive discharge. Secondary cancer appears as one or more hard nodules, and is a sequel to primary growths in the stomach, intestine, or liver; if one of the nodules is subjected to microscopic examination and found to contain columnar epithelium, a needless operation will be avoided, a radical cure being out of the question.

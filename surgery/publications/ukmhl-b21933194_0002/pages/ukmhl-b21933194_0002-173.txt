EPITHELIOMA OF LIP. 153 lip so as to include the tumour and an area of healthy tissue beyond it. In larger growths, particularly when situated at the angle of the mouth, it is necessary to carry an incision trans- versely into the cheek to enable the lip to be repaired without leaving deformity. When it is necessary to remove the greater part of the lower lip, the defect may be filled up by flaps of skin taken from below the jaw (Symeâ€™s operation). When the tumour is adherent to the lower jaw it is necessary to resect a portion of that bone along with the lip. The frequency with which recur- rence takes place in the lymphatic glands below the jaw renders it advisable to remove these in all cases, whether they are palpably enlarged or not. J. Hutchinson, junr., recommends that the submaxillary and submental triangles on both sides should be cleared out as a routine procedure. In inoperable cases benefit may follow the use of the X-rays. It is not always advisable for the practitioner to carry out these extensive operations in the early stages of the disease, when, for example, there is only a small horny swelling on the surface of the lip. Under these conditions the swelling should be freely excised, under local anaesthesia, and the growth examined microscopically. If evidence of malignancy is present the glands should at once be excised. Epithelioma of the upper lip is less common. It occurs with equal frequency in the two sexes, progresses more slowly, and is, on the whole, less malignant. It sometimes appears to be due to contact infection from the lower lip. It is treated on the same lines as cancer of the lower lip.

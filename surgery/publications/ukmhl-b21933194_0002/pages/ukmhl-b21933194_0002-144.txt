124 DISEASES OF THE SPINE- AND CORD. The term spina bifida occulta is applied to a condition in which there is no protrusion of the spinal contents, although the vertebral arches are deficient. The skin over the gap in the bone is often puckered and adherent, and is frequently covered with a growth of coarse hair. A mass of fat may project towards the surface, and when situated in the lumbo-sacral region may suggest a caudal appendage or tail (Fig. 39). The clinical importance of spina bifida occulta lies in the fact that it is sometimes associated with nerve symptoms, in the form of sensory, motor, and trophic dis- turbances referable to the lower limbs and the sphincters. These nerve symptoms usually result from the presence of a tough cord composed of connective tissue, fat, and muscle, stretching from the skin through the vertebral canal to the lower end of the spinal cord. As this strand of tissue does not grow in proportion with the body, in the course of years it drags the cord against the lower border of the membrana reuniens, which closes in the vertebral canal posteriorly. These symptoms may be relieved by the removal of this strand of tissue from the gap in the vertebral arches, or by incising the membrana reuniens. Congenital Sacro - coccygeal Tumours.—Many varieties of congenital tumours are met with in the region of the sacrum and coccyx. The majority are developed in relation to the communication which exists in the embryo between the neural canal and the alimentary tract—the post-anal gut or neurenteric canal. Sometimes a dermoid cyst containing a tuft of hair, and less frequently an adenoma, develops between the coccyx and the rectum, and may project either towards the surface or towards the bowel.

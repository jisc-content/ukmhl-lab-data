Wounds of the tongue are most commonly produced by the teeth, as, for instance, when a child falls on the chin with the tongue protruded, or when an epileptic bites his tongue during a fit. Less frequently a foreign body, such as a pipe-stem, a bullet, or a displaced tooth, is driven into the tongue. The immediate risk of such injuries is haemorrhage, particularly when the posterior part of the tongue is implicated and the wound penetrates deeply. Of the later complications sepsis and secondary haemorrhage are the most serious, and the risk is greatest when a foreign body is embedded in the tongue. Treatment.—In superficial wounds near the tip the oozing is efficiently arrested by sutures, but in deeper wounds, and especially if they implicate the posterior part of the tongue, a ligature must be applied to the bleeding vessel. Secondary haemorrhage is much more difficult to arrest on account of the friable state of the tissues, and it may be necessary to ligature the lingual or even the external carotid in the neck. To prevent septic complications any foreign body must be removed and an antiseptic moutli-wash regularly employed. Cases have been recorded in which such a foreign body as a bullet, a needle, or a piece of a pipe-stem, has remained embedded in the substance of the tongue for a long period, and caused a firm, indolent swelling liable to be mistaken for a new growth.

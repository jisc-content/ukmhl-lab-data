686 THE URETHRA. The posterior or deep urethra comprises the membranous and prostatic portions. The membranous urethra lies about one inch below the lower border of the symphysis between the two layers of the triangular liga- ment ; it is about half an inch long, and is surrounded by the compressor urethras—the “ shut-off ” muscle—which, when spasmodically contracted, may prevent the passage of a soft catheter. An instrument in the membranous urethra is easily felt from the rectum immediately anterior to the prostate. The prostatic urethra—an inch and a quarter in length —is the widest and most distensible portion of the tube ; in the erect Fig. 187.—Diagram of Male Urethra. A, Prostatic, B, Membranous, C, Bulbous Urethra; T.L., Triangular Ligament. posture its direction is almost vertical, with a slight curve concave towards the pubes ; the mucous membrane is extremely sensitive, and when it is inflamed, the nerve mechanism of micturition is greatly disturbed. The urethra is lubricated by the secretion of the glands of the prostate and seminal vesicles, which open into the prostatic urethra, of Cowper’s glands, which lie between the two layers of the triangular ligament and open into the floor of the bulbous portion, and of numerous minute mucous glands opening into the penile urethra. All of these glands become more active during sexual excitement, and their secretion constitutes the chief bulk of the seminal fluid. The examination of a patient suffering from any affection of the urethra includes an inquiry into the history, with special reference to the frequency of micturition, the presence or absence of pain, the size

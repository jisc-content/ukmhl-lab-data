306 THE CHEST. inch thick. In cases of long standing this fibrinous exudate becomes organised into connective tissue, and the pleura becomes greatly thickened, and adhesions may form between its visceral and parietal layers. These adhesions may divide the cavity up into several loculi (Fig. 83). The lung is more or less collapsed and drawn back towards the vertebral groove. In course of time it undergoes sclerotic changes, and from the thickening of the pleura over it and the adhesions which bind it down it becomes incapable of expanding again. Clinical Features.—The earliest symptoms of empyema are Fig. 83.—Multilocular empyema. Note thickening of the visceral pleura and displacement of the heart. usually overshadowed by those of the condition on which it supervenes, and in many cases following on pleurisy or pneu- monia it is only suspected because recovery from the primary illness is delayed or interrupted. In those cases due to the bursting of an abscess in an adjacent part, a sudden exacerbation of symptoms associated with respiratory difficulty suggests the possibility of empyema. Certain symptoms, however, are common to all cases, these are: immobility of the affected side of the chest, flattening and sometimes even bulging of the intercostal spaces, dulness on percussion, and absence of the breath sounds and vocal fremitus.

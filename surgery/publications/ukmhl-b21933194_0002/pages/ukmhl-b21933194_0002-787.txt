HYDROCELE 759 comes on insidiously in middle-aged men, and forms a pyriform, rounded, or oblong swelling, which begins in the lower part of the scrotum and gradually en- larges from below upwards. It is smooth on the surface, uniform in outline, tense and elastic in consistence, and stands out pro- minently in the scrotum (Fig. 199). When the walls of the sac are calcified, a sensation of egg- shell cracking may be elicited on squeezing the swelling. On per- cussion it is dull and may yield a peculiar thrill. In early cases the swelling may be translucent, but too much weight must not be attached to this sign, as thicken- ing of the wall of the sac, the presence of adhesions, discolora- tion of the contained fluid, or other causes may render it opaque. There is no true impulse on cough- ing, but the contraction of the abdominal walls may give an apparent impulse. The fluid does not leave the scrotum when the patient lies down, and cannot be reduced into the abdominal cavity by pressure. There is no pain, but the weight of the fluid causes a dragging sensation along the line of the cord. The position of the testis in relation to the sac varies, sometimes it is at the lower part of the scrotum, some- times about halfway down (Fig. 200). It can usually be located—by eliciting testicu- lar sensation on squeezing it.

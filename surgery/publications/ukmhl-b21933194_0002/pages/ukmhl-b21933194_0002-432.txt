412 HERNIA. Bowel Parietal Hernial sac Testis Fig. 102.—Diagram of Infantile Hernia. processus vaginalis has become shut off at the upper end of the testicle but remains open above, a loop of bowel may descend into the unobliterated portion, constituting a hernia into the funicular process (Fig. 101). It differs from the complete congenital form above described in the follow- ing respects : the testis is below the fundus of the sac, quite separate and distinct from it; the hernia is seldom so large, and is cylindrical rather than globular in shape, and usually appears at a later period of life. Infantile Hernia (Fig. 102).— This rare variety of hernia is not well named; it does not present any distinctive clinical features, and is not identified until exposed by opera- tion. The term “ infantile ” has no reference to the age at which the hernial tumour appears, for the majority of cases have been met with in adults. A second peritoneal process is pulled down into the scrotum by an aberrant attachment of the gubernaculum testis ; the new sac descends behind the processus and bulges into it, so that on cutting down to the protruded gut from the front three layers of peri- toneum are met with, the first two belonging to the processus vaginalis, and the third representing the newly formed hernial sac. Closely allied to infantile hernia is that known as en- cysted hernia (Fig. 103), in which a newly formed sac descends into and invaginates the processus vaginalis, which is obliterated only at the in- ternal abdominal ring, and which entirely envelops the hernia instead of lying in front of it as in the infantile variety. It may be associated with retention of the testis in the inguinal canal.

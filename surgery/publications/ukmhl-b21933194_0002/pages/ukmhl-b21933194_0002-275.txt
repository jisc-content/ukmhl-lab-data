PARENCHYMATOUS GOITRE. 255 may extend a considerable distance from the position of the normal thyroid, reaching even behind the sternum into the thorax—intra- thoracicor retrosternal goitre. When the secreting ' elements increase out of proportion to the stroma, numerous rounded or irregular spaces, filled with a thick, yellow, colloid material, are formed in the substance of the goitre—colloid goitre. The majority of these spaces are not larger than a pea, but one or more may enlarge and form cysts of consider- able size—cystic goitre. These varieties, especi- ally the cystic form, attain greater dimensions than any other form of goitre. When the fibrous stroma is greatly in excess—-fibrous goitre — the swelling is smaller, firmer, and sflows a greater tend- ency to contract and compress the trachea. If the sclerosis is ex- treme, and the secret- ory tissue undergoes atrophy, myxcedema may result. In some cases the hyperplasia affects chiefly the blood- vessels of the thyroid —vascular goitre. The capillaries, veins and arteries are increased in size and number, and the swelling pulsates, and increases in size when the patient makes any muscular effort. Haemorrhagic cysts frequently develop in the substance of these goitres. Flo. 73.—Section of Goitre shown in Fig. 72, to illustrate compression of Trachea.

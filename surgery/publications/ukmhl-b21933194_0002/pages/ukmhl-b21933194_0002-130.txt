110 DISEASES OF THE SPINE AND CORD. swallowing and breathing, and snoring during sleep; if it bursts internally it may cause suffocation. The abscess may bulge towards one or both sides of the neck, and come to the surface behind the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle (Fig. 29). In some cases it comes to the surface in the sub-occipital region. If the cord is pressed upon by inflammatory products, there is muscular weakness, beginning in the arms and passing to the legs, and sometimes followed by complete paralysis. The bladder and rectum are usually implicated. Sudden death may result when dislocation of the atlo- axoid joint takes place. Cervical caries has to be diagnosed from rheumatic torticollis (p. 238); and from the effects of injuries, such as sprain or twists of the spine. When a retro-pharyn- geal abscess points behind the sterno-mastoid, it is apt to be mistaken for a cold abscess originating in tuber- culous cervical glands. Retro- pharyngeal abscess due to other causes is described with Fig. 29. —- Attitude of Patient suffering diseases of the pharynx from Tuberculous Diseaseof the Cervical (p. 163). Spine.

Lateral movements of the head are prevented by means of sandbags. After the acute symptoms have subsided, the spine should be fixed by some rigid apparatus, such as a double Thomas’s splint, pro- longed so as to support the occiput. A retro-pharyngeal abscess should be opened from the side of the neck by an incision along the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid, as first recommended by Chiene. The abscess is evacuated, and the cavity filled with iodoform emulsion and

432 HERNIA. is larger when the bladder is full and speedily diminishes in size with micturition. In the case of a small protrusion, however, especially when it is of the nature of a diverticulum communi- cating with the bladder by a small opening, these features may not be sufficiently marked to attract attention. If the condition is suspected, it may be confirmed by injecting fluid into the bladder and so distending the prolapsed portion, or by examina- tion with the cystoscope, when the wall of the bladder may be seen to be displaced towards the site of the hernia. The chief danger consists in the likelihood of the bladder being opened while operating for the radical cure. The appear- ances met with in operating are : an unusual amount of extra- peritoneal fat around the sac, and the presence in many cases of what appears to be a second sac to the inner side of the hernial sac proper. Treatment.—The hernia if diagnosed should be subjected to operation. The details of the operation depend on the variety of hernia. If the bladder be accidentally wounded, its wall should be sutured, the organ replaced, and the external wound closed except for a drain; the bladder is kept continually empty by a rubber catheter connected to a suction apparatus. Some- times the injury to the bladder is not recognised at the time of operation, and is only suggested by the patient passing blood- stained urine by the urethra, and by the onset of septic com- plications associated with urinary infiltration, the escape of urine from the wound, and the formation of a urinary fistula. In multiparous women a hernial protrusion of the bladder into the vagina—vaginal cystocele—is by no means uncommon.

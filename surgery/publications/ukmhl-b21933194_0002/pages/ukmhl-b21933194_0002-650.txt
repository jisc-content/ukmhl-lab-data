626 THE KIDNEY AND URETER. A closed hydronephrosis, when of large size, fills up the flank, and can be palpated biraanually ; the colon lies in front of it, and the dulness over the cyst is continuous with that of the liver. A very large tumour bulges the ribs outwards, fills up one side of the abdomen, and, by extending down to the pelvis, may simulate an ovarian cyst. When the cyst fills the greater part of the belly, as it sometimes does in children, it may simulate a tuberculous ascites. In intermittent hydronephrosis, such, for example, as that associated with abnormal renal mobility, there are attacks of pain and sickness like those pro- duced by calculus, and from the fact that these attacks may be attended with marked ten- derness of the kidney and with haematuria, the differential diag- nosis may be diffi- cult. During the attack, while the pelvis is tempor- arily closed, the kidney is con- gested, and bleed- ing may take place into the sac.

If the attacks recur with great frequency, haematuria may be more or less constant. In the early stages of intermittent hydronephrosis the kidney returns to its normal size after the occlusion is relieved, and it is sometimes observed during the attack that the swelling suddenly disappears on manipulation, the kink being undone and the urine passing on. In the later stages the elastic recoil of the pelvis is lost and the organ remains enlarged, although it may not be easily palpable owing to the slackness of the cyst wall, and the attacks of pain may entirely disappear.

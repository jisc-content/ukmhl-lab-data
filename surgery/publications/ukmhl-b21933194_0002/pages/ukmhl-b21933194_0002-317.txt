INJURIES OF THE THORACIC VISCERA. 297 becomes restless, short of breath, and cyanosed. The lung tends to collapse to a slight extent, and the prominent physical signs are bulging of the intercostal spaces, hyper-resonance on percussion, loss of vocal fremitus, and faintness or absence of the breath sounds and of vocal resonance. If the lung is markedly collapsed, the heart, the liver, or the spleen may be displaced, and pulmonary consolidation may ensue. As the air which enters the pleura is free of bacteria, septic complications seldom ensue. When the wound in the lung heals, the air becomes absorbed, the lung expands again, and in the course of four or five days which the lung has been damaged. It is more likely to follow small punctured wounds, especially if they be valvular, than extensive lacerated wounds. The air may escape directly into the tissues of the chest wall through a rent in the pleura caused by a fragment of broken rib or a pointed instrument. When the lung is torn while the pleura remains intact, the air may escape along the peribronchial connective tissue into the media- stinum, and thence into the root of the neck. In punctured wounds of the parietes, air may be sucked in by the respiratory movements of the chest and give rise to emphysema. When it comes from the lung, the air is pressed out during expiration, and it may spread over a wide area of the body (Fig. 81). The skin in the emphysematous area is slightly

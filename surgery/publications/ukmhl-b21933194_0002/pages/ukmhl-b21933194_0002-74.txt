54 DISEASES OF THE BRAIN AND MEMBRANES. the intra-cranial tension, or to give rise to localised cerebral symptoms by pressing on the brain. When associated with compound fracture, the abscess usually forms within a few days of the injury, and it may spread over a wider area and come to encroach on the cranial cavity suffici- ently to raise the intra-cranial tension and cause symptoms of compression, or even to press upon cortical centres and produce localised paralyses. The presence of a wound in the scalp permits of discharge, and the puffy tumour does not necessarily form. Treatment.â€”When the abscess is secondary to middle ear disease, the mastoid is opened, the eroded bone exposed, and sufficient of it removed with rongeur forceps to admit of free drainage. When the infection has spread from the frontal sinus, the skull is trephined in the frontal region, the precise site being indicated by the oedematous area in the scalp, and the diseased bone is removed. In cases of compound fracture, drainage is established by freely enlarging the scalp wound, and removing loose, depressed or inflamed portions of bone, and then treating the wound by the open method. Sometimes the infection spreads from the dura to the adjacent arachno-pia, and sets up a localised lepto-meningitis. This usually results in the formation of adhesions which shut off the infected area from the general arachno-pial space. Pus may form among these adhesions, constituting a sub-dural abscess, and may infiltrate the superficial layers of the cortex (purulent encephalitis, or meningo-encephcilitis) (Fig. 15). The symptoms are similar to those of extra-dural abscess, but may be more severe ; and it is seldom possible to distinguish

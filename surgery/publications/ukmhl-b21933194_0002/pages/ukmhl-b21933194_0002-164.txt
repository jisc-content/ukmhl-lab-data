If the mucous membrane of the mouth or of the eyelid is implicated, its edges should be approximated by a separate row of stitches introduced from the inside. The complications of face wounds, such, for example, as erysipelas or tetanus, are attributable to infection with micro- organisms. Cicatricial contraction after severe burns may lead to marked deformities of the eyelids (ectropion), mouth, and nose. When the burn has implicated the neck, the chin may be drawn towards the chest, and the movements of the lower jaw and head seriously impeded (Fig. 48). Tumours.—The simple tumours met with on the face include sebaceous and dermoid cysts, nsevi, plexiform neuro- mata and adenomata; the malignant forms include the squamous epithelioma, and rodent, paraffin, and melanotic cancers. Epithelioma occurs most frequently in men beyond the age of forty. The affection Fig. 48.—Cicatricial Contraction follow- usually begins at the margin ing Burn in Childhood causing ex- f the q the edge of the treme deformity of mouth, neck, and 1 ’ . ° . . upper extremity. nostril, or the angle of the eye. There is usually a history of prolonged or repeated irritation, or the condition may develop in connection with a scar, a wart, a cutaneous horn, or an ulcerating sebaceous cyst. It may begin as a hard nodule, or as a papillary growth which soon breaks down on the surface leaving a deep ulcer with a characteristically indurated base — the crateriform ulcer. The neighbouring lymphatic glands are infected early, but metastases to other organs are not common. The treatment consists in excising the growth and the associated lymphatic glands as early and as freely as possible. When excision is impracticable, benefit may be derived from the use of the X-rays.

LUMBAR PUNCTURE. 19 The normal cerebrospinal fluid is clear and colourless, having a specific gravity of 1006-1008, and containing a trace of serum globulin and albumose, and a substance which reduces Fehling’s solution (Sir Wm. Turner). Microscopically, it contains some large endothelial cells and a few lymphocytes. Diagnostic Puncture.—Examination of the fluid withdrawn by lumbar puncture has proved useful in diagnosis in cases of intra-cranial and intra-spinal haemorrhage, in various forms of Fir. 7.—Site for introduction of needle in Lumbar Puncture. meningitis, in cerebral abscess, and in some cases of cerebral tumour. The first few drops of fluid should be discarded as they may be stained with blood from the puncture. To determine whether staining of the fluid is due to luemorrhage from the puncture, or to a pre-existing intra-cranial or intra-thecal haemorrhage, the fluid should be centrifuged; in the former case the supernatant fluid is clear and limpid, in the latter it retains a yellow tinge. Extra-dural haemorrhage is not attended with the presence of blood in the cerebro-spinal fluid. In cases of acute meningitis the fluid is turbid, and contains

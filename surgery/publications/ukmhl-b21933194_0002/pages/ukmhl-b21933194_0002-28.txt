THE SCALP. the fontanelles, a nsevus may derive pulsation from the brain, and so simulate a meningocele. Cirsoid aneurysm is usually met with in the course of the temporal artery, and may involve the greater part of the scalp. Large, distended, tortuous, bluish vessels pulsating synchronously with the heart are seen and felt. They can be emptied by pressure, but fill up again at once on removal of the pressure. The patient complains of dizziness, headache, and a persistent rushing sound in the head. Ulceration of the skin over the dilated vessels, leading to fatal haemorrhage, may take place. They may be treated by excision, after dividing and ligaturing the larger vessels entering the swelling; or the dilated vessels may be cut across at several points and both ends ligatured. Krogius recommends the introduction of a series of subcutaneous ligatures so as to surround the whole periphery of the pulsating tumour, and so interrupt the blood flow. Ligature of the main afferent vessels, or of the external or common carotid, has been followed by recurrence, owing to the free anastomotic circulation in the scalp. In some cases electrolysis has yielded good results. Traumatic aneurysm of the temporal artery was comparatively common in the days when the practice of bleeding from this vessel was in vogue, but it is seldom met with now. Arterio-venous aneurysm may also occur in the course of the temporal artery, as a result of injury, and is best treated by complete extirpation of the segments of the vessels implicated.

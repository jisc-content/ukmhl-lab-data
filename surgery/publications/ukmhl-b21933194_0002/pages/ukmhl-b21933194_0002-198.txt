178 THE JAWS, INCLUDING TEETH AND GUMS. When only one side is broken, the smaller fragment is usually displaced outwards and forwards by the masseter and temporal muscles, so that it overlaps the larger fragment. In bilateral fractures the central loose segment is driven downwards and backwards towards the hyoid bone by the force causing the fracture, and is held in this position by the muscles attached to the chin, while both lateral fragments are tilted outwards and forwards by the masseters and temporals. The amount of dis- placement is best recognised by observing the degree of irregu- larity in the line of the teeth. Abnormal mobility and crepitus Fig. 60.—Multiple Fracture of Lower Jaw. (From Sir Patrick Heron Watson’s collection.) are readily elicited, and there is severe pain, particularly if the inferior dental nerve is stretched or crushed. The patient’s attitude is characteristic; he supports the broken jaw with his hands, and keeps it as steady as possible when he attempts to speak or swallow. Saliva dribbles from the open mouth and the speech is indistinct. In adults, the bone may be broken at the symphysis as a result of lateral compression of the jaw—for example, by pressing together the angles. The general characters of the fracture are the same as those of fracture of the body, but the displacement is inconsiderable. Fractures at the angle and through the ascending ramus are less common, and are not attended with deformity, as the frag-

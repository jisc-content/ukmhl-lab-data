784 AN AESTHETICS. drug, like cocain, novocain, and eucain, is less safe and certain than tropacocain. The anaesthesia thus induced is frequently accompanied by serious complications, such as collapse, sickness, vomiting, and sometimes paralysis of respiration; it often leaves severe and persistent headache and neuralgic. pains in the limbs, and its extent and duration cannot be accurately controlled. The mortality is little less than that attending the administra- tion of chloroform, and is greater than that of ether. For these reasons, and in view of the fact that the patient is conscious of what is being done during the operation, it cannot be said that spinal anaesthesia possesses any material advantages over general anaesthesia. Freezing with Ethyl Chloride.â€”A limited area of the skin may be rendered anaesthetic by freezing it with a spray of chloride of ethyl projected through a line nozzle from a glass or metal cylinder. The cylinder is held at a distance of from eight to ten inches from the skin, and a line spray projected on to the area to be incised. After a few seconds the skin becomes hard and white in round patches which coalesce as it freezes, and it remains insensitive for three or four minutes. Only short opera- tions, for example, the incision of an abscess or whitlow, or the insertion of an aspirator needle, can be carried out under the anaesthesia produced by this method.

395 TUBERCULOSIS OF THE APPENDIX. uncommon. When it occurs during the early months the patient is very liable to abort, especially if the right uterine appendages are involved in the disease. In view of the risks which may ensue, the patient should be subjected to operation as soon as the condition is diagnosed. Tuberculosis of the Appendix.â€”Tuberculous disease may occur in the appendix alone, but is usually an accompaniment of tuberculosis of the caecum or of the surrounding peritoneum. When the bacillus reaches the appendix by way of the intestine, it affects the mucous membrane in the first instance, and the disease then spreads to the other coats. In a considerable number of cases the condition gives rise to no symptoms. When it is attended with acute symptoms they simulate those of ordinary appendicitis, except that diarrhoea is more commonly present. In the chronic variety the attacks are mild, and diarrhoea is very frequently present; there may be recurrent attacks of pain; and a localised cold abscess may form in the iliac fossa ; or the tuberculosis may spread to the peritoneum. The treatment is carried out on the same lines as for ordinary appendicitis. Actinomycosis is a very rare condition, and usually escapes recognition until the characteristic fungus is found in the pus discharging from an abscess or sinus over the appendix. Primary malignant disease of the appendix is a rare condi- tion, which is only discovered accidentally in the routine exam- ination of the organ after removal; the disease is usually a columnar epithelioma. In the majority of the recorded cases the symptoms were those of a mild appendicitis, and the results of the removal of the organ have been highly satisfactory.

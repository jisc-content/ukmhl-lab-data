The ring is bounded in front by Poupart’s ligament and the deep crural arch; behind by the pubic bone covered by the pectineus muscle and fascia; to the outer side by the partition of the crural sheath which separates the ring from the common femoral vein; and to the inner side by Gimbernat’s ligament. The deep epigastric artery, in its course inwards from the external iliac, passes close to the upper and outer angle of the crural ring, and gives off its pubic branch, which runs transversely inwards to Gimbernat’s ligament to anastomose with the pubic branch of the obturator. An enlargement of this anas- tomosis constitutes an “aber- rant obturator,” the obtur- ator arising by a common trunk with the epigastric. When it curves round the inner side of the ring along the free margin of Gimber- nat’s ligament, it is liable to be wounded in the operation of herniotomy. The crural canal is about half an inch in length. In front of it the upper margin of the saphenous opening—Hey’s ligament—arches inwards to join Poupart’s and Gimber- nat’s ligaments. The upper- part of the pectineal fascia is strengthened by a tough baud of fibrous tissue, known as Cooper’s ligament. A hernia passing along the canal at first descends vertically, but on reaching the saphenous opening it bulges forwards, and enlarges in a direction upwards and outwards till it may pass over Poupart’s ligament. The coverings of a femoral hernia are : the integument, including the cribriform fascia, the femoral sheath representing the transversalis fascia, the extra-peritoneal tissue and septum crurale, and the peritoneum, which constitutes the sac. In small hernise, the sac may be so loosely attached that it is sometimes reduced with the contents. In very large herniae, the sac may present several diverticula and extend down the thigh.

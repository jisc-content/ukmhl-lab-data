113 POTT’S DISEASE. The patient often complains of pain in the abdomen—which in children may be mistaken for a simple “belly-ache”—and of pain shooting down the buttocks and into the legs. Psoas Abscess.—When an abscess forms it usually occupies the sheath of the psoas muscle, in which it spreads down towards the iliac fossa, and into the thigh, passing beneath Poupart’s ligament, posterior and external to the femoral vessels (Fig. 32). The communication between the pelvis and the thigh is often very narrow, so that the abscess cavity has some- what the shape of an hour-glass. The pus may reach the surface in the region of the saphenous opening, or may spread farther down the thigh under cover of the deep fascia. In some cases it is liable to be mistaken for a femoral hernia, as the swelling be- comes smaller when the patient lies down, and ap- pears to have an impulse on coughing. Lumbar Abscess.—Some- times the pus travels along the posterior branches of the lumbar vessels and nerves to the outer border of the erector spinse, and comes to the surface in the space be- tween the edges of the lat- issimus dorsi and external oblique muscles — the tri- Fig. 32.—Left Psoas Abscess, angle of Petit. In rare cases it passes through the sacro-sciatic foramen and forms a swelling in the buttock (sub-gluteal abscess) ; or it may pass through the obturator foramen and reach the surface in the adductor region of the thigh or in the perineum. Lumbo- sacral Region.—Pott’s disease in the lumbo-sacral region usually affects adults, and, on account of the breadth of the vertebral bodies and the limited range of movement in this segment of the spine, is seldom accompanied by marked symptoms or deformity. The diagnosis, therefore, is often very difficult. The disease may be associated with pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve, which is liable to be mistaken for ordinary sciatica. Single or double iliac abscess frequently forms without VOL. II—8

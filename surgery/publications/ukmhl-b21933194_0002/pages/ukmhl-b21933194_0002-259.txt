WRY-NECK OR TORTICOLLIS. 239 glands, and disease of the cervical spine, in which the head may assume an abnormal attitude, the position being that which gives the patient greatest comfort. The treatment consists in administering anti-rheumatic drugs, in applying warm dressings, and gentle massage. Permanent or true wry-neck is due to an organic shortening of the sterno-mastoid muscle. In some cases the trapezius, the splenius, the scaleni, and even the levator anguli scapulae muscles are also affected. The sternal head of the sterno - mastoid is always markedly shortened, and stands out as a tight cord ; sometimes the clavicular head is also prominent. The cervical fascia is con- tracted to a greater or less extent in all cases—a point of importance in con- nection with treat- ment. Opinion is divided concerning the eti- ology of the condition. By some it is regarded as a truly congenital deformity resulting from an arrest of de- velopment from undue pressure on the foetus in utero, or from some ante-datal affection of the muscles or nerves. By others it is believed to result from cica- tricial contraction of the muscle following a rupture of its fibres occurring during delivery. In a considerable proportion of children who develop wry-neck there is a history that the birth was a difficult one, the presentation having been abnormal ; and that a swelling was observed in the sterno-mastoid shortly after birth. This swelling—a hcematoma of the sterno-mastoid—was at first soft, later became smaller, and eventually disappeared. In course of time, sometimes months, sometimes years after the dis- appearance of the swelling, shortening of the muscle takes place, FiG. 70. — Permanent Wry-neck, showing char- acteristic attitude of head, hemiatrophy of face on affected side, asymmetry of eyes, and mouth.

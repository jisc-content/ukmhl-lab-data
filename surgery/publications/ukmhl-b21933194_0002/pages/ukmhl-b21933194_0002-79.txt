TEMPORO- SPHENOIDAL ABSCESS. 59 EG CENTRE abscess having been established, the next question is to determine its situation. Temporo-sphenoidal Abscess. — The existence of middle ear disease is always presumptive evidence that the abscess is in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. Small abscesses in this lobe may pro- duce no localising symptoms. Those of large size may press indirectly on the motor cortex, on the fibres passing through the internal capsule, or on individual cranial nerves. It is important to observe the order in which paralysis of the opposite side of the body conies on. When it begins in the face and passes successively to the arm and leg, the pressure is on the cortical centres. When the paralysis progresses in the op- posite direction—leg, arm, face —the pressure is on the nerve fibres passing through the in- ternal capsule (Fig. 16). Motor aphasia may result from pressure on the left inferior frontal convolu- tion, while audi- tory aphasia may result from abscess in the posterior part of the first superior temporal convolu- tion.

Abscess in the occipital lobe pro- duces interference with the visual functions. An abscess in the frontal lobe, even when of large size, may give rise to no localising symptoms. If on the left side, Broca’s convolution may be implicated, and motor aphasia result. Cerebellar Abscess. -—Next to the temporo - sphenoidal lobe, the cerebellum is the most common seat of abscess. Cere- bellar abscess is usually due to spread of infection from a septic thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus, either directly from a sub-dural abscess formed in relation to the walls of the sinus,

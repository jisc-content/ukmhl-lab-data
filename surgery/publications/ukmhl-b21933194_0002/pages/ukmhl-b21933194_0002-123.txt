PENETRATING WOUNDS. 103 damage done to the cord, and on whether or not the wound is infected. In many cases the condition is complicated by injuries of the pleural or peritoneal cavities and their contained viscera, or by injury of the trachea, oesophagus, or large vessels and nerves of the neck. When the membranes of the cord are opened the profuse and the prolonged escape of cerebro-spinal fluid may prove a serious complication. Treatment.â€”The wound of the soft parts is treated on the same lines as other wounds. When the spinous processes and laminae are driven in upon the cord they must be elevated at once by operation. In injuries involving the lumbo-sacral region it is sometimes advisable to perform laminectomy for .the pur- pose of suturing divided nerve cords. When there is evidence that the spinal cord is completely divided, operation is contra-indicated. Attempts have been made to unite the two ends of the divided cord by sutures, but there is as yet no authentic record of restoration of function following the operation.

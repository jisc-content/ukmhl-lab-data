634 THE KIDNEY AND URETER. composition of any stone is rarely the same throughout; the varieties are named according to the preponderat- ing constituent. There is no constant relationship between the reaction of the urine and the composition of the stone. The etiology of stone is unknown. The condition is more frequent in cer- tain families, especially tainted with a gouty inheritance, and it is much more common in some countries, particularly Hungary, India, and China, than in others. In this country it is most prevalent in Norfolk. It is met with chiefly in boys under ten, and in adults after middle life. It is usually said to be rare in the female, but operation statistics showthat renal calculus occurs with almost equal frequency in the two sexes. Seat of Formation, Shape, and Size.—A stone is usually situ- ated in the pelvis or in one of the calyces. A stone which is lodged in a calyx is usually spherical, while one lodged in the pelvis is often triangular, with the apex directed towards and into the ureter. In exceptional cases the stone forms a cast of the entire pelvis, and presents coral-like branches corresponding to the individual calyces (Fig. 171). Small stones may pass into the ureter, and lodge just below the kidney, at the brim of the true pelvis, or near its termination in the bladder. A ureteral calculus is usually elongated like a date- stone, but may become rounded. The channel of the ureter may be obstructed by the stone itself, or obstruction may result from set. 55.

152 THE FACE, ORBIT, AND LIPS. Epithelioma of the lip is nearly always of the squamous- celled variety, and is met with either as a fnngating wart-like projection, or as an indurated ulcer. It almost exclusively occurs on the lower lip of men over forty years of age. The growth begins about midway between the middle line and the angle of the mouth, either as a horny epidermal thickening, or as a warty excrescence, which bleeds readily and soon ulcerates. The affection is said to be especially common in those who smoke irritation of the lip by the friction of the pipe stem may play some part in determin- ing the excessive growth of epithelium, and it is a sug- gestive fact that, while epi- thelioma of the lip is rare in women, the majority of those who do suffer are smokers. The ulceration spreads along the lip, chiefly towards the angle of the mouth, and downwards towards the chin, and the substance of the lip becomes swollen and in- durated. The edges are char- acteristically raised and hard, and the raw surface is ex- tremely painful, especially when irritated by hot food or fluids. The growth is liable to spread to the mucous membrane and gum, and to invade the lower jaw. The disease spreads early to the sub- mental and submaxillary glands, which are best felt with one finger inside the mouth, under the tongue, and another outside, below the jaw. The infected glands tend to become fixed to the jaw, and to soften, liquefy, and fungate. Metastasis to internal organs is rare. Unless removed by operation the disease usually proves fatal in from three to three and a half years. The treatment consists in early and free removal of the affected portion of lip and of the infected glands. In comparatively small growths which do not involve the angle of the mouth, a V-shaped incision is carried through the entire thickness of the short clay pipes.

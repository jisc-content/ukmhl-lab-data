It was formerly believed that an attack of gout or the taking of certain alcoholic drinks and articles of diet caused urethritis, but this only occurs if the patient is already the subject of a latent gonorrhoeal infection.

In a stained film of the urethral discharge the cocci are found in the interior of the pus cells, to a less extent in the epithelial cells and in the serum. They stain readily with aniline dyes and are decolorised by Gram’s method. In a recent gonorrhoea they are found in pure culture, but in course of time other organisms make their appearance and increase in number as the gonococci become fewer. Gonococci, while pyogenic in the urethra, do not necessarily lead to the

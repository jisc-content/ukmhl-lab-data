FRACTURES OF THE BASE. 47 direct violence. Von Bergmann, Bruns, and Messerer have done much to elucidate the mechanism of basal fractures. In the consideration of the mode of production of basal fractures by indirect violence, the irregular shape of the cavity, the varying strength and thickness of its different parts, and the existence of the foramina through the bone are to be borne in mind. The force acting on the skull tends to increase one diameter of the cavity, and to diminish the opposite diameter. The resulting fracture, therefore, is due to bursting of the skull, and tends to take place at the part which has least elasticity—that is, at the base. It has been found that the site and direction of basal fractures bear a fairly constant relation to the direction of the force by which they are produced. When, for example, the skull is compressed from side to side, the line of fracture through the base is usually transverse, and it may implicate one or both sides (Fig. 13). On the other hand- when the pres- sure is antero-posterior, the fracture tends to be longi- tudinal, and when oblique it tends to be diagonal. Fractures of the base usually take the form of a single fissure, or a series Fig. 13. — Transverse Fracture through of fissures, which, as a rule, Middle Fossa of Base of Skull, with fis- run through the foramina fres radiating into anterior and posterior in their track. Small por- ° *' tions of bone are sometimes completely separated. It is very common for a fissure through the base to be continued for a considerable distance on to the vault. The fracture may involve only one fossa, but as a rule fissures radiate into two or all of them (Fig. 13). Fractures of the anterior and middle fossae are usually rendered com- pound by tearing of the mucous membrane of the pharynx, the nose, or the ear. Basal fractures are very frequently associated with contusion and laceration of the brain, and also with injuries of one or other of the cranial nerves.

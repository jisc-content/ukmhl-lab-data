CAUSES OF INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 479 Internal Hernise.—Several varieties of hernia that do not give rise to visible swelling externally are met with. In diaphragmatic hernia a portion of the abdominal contents, usually the stomach or colon, is thrust into the thorax through an opening in the diaphragm. The opening may be congenital or may result from rupture or wound of the diaphragm; in either case it is usually situated on the left side (Fig. 126). The condition is rarely diagnosed by clinical methods. It is only remediable* by operative mea- sures, and the thoracic route affords the best access. Duodenal Hernia : there are several varieties of hernia arising in the vicinity of the duodeno- jejunal junction, the gut enter- ing one or other of the many fossae to be found in this region. The gut as it enters the fossa pushes the peritoneal lining in front of it, so as to form a sac, which lies behind the posterior parietal peritoneum. The usual contents are small intestine, and when they are strangulated the constriction is produced by the margins of the orifice of the sac. It is seldom diagnosed except by an exploratory laparotomy. The only treatment is by opera- tion, the contents being reduced and the neck of the sac obliter- ated. In hernia into the foramen of Winslow a portion of the intes- tine passes through the foramen into the lesser sac of peritoneum. In inter-sigmoid hernia the bowel is thrust into the inter-sigmoid fossa, which is a funnel-shaped depression between the layers of the pelvic meso-colon. In peri-ccecal hernia the bowel is thrust into one or other of the pouches met with in the region of the Fig. 126. — Diaphragmatic Hernia. The intestines, with the stomach and spleen, occupy the left pleural cavity. (Anatomical Museum, University of Edinburgh.) ileo-ctecal junction. Strangulation by Bands or through Abnormal Apertures.—

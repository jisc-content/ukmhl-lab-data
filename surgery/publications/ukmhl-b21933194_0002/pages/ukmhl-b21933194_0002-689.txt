CYSTITIS. 665 female readily transmits organisms from the vulva, especially in the conditions that attend the puerperal state. Organisms derived from the blood and excreted by the kidneys are conveyed to the bladder by the ureters, but so long as the bladder and urethra functionate normally, these organisms are expelled with the urine before they are able to establish themselves. It is of interest to note that the kidney may, over long periods, discharge a large amount of pus by way of the bladder without causing cystitis. The walls of the bladder may be traversed by organisms derived from the surroundings, possibly from the rectum, certainly from pelvic abscesses of appendicular or other origin, but even if the abscess has ruptured into the bladder this does not necessarily resnlt in cystitis. Organisms cause cystitis directly by the action of their toxins on the mucous mem- brane, or indirectly by the changes they bring about in the urine. Changes in the Bladder.— The changes in acute cystitis are most marked in the region of the neck of the bladder, and they affect chiefly the mucous membrane, which is intensely congested—of a brilliant scar- let when seen with the cysto- scope—and may show minute htemorrhages. Pus and flakes of fibrin adhere to the sur- face and float in the urine, and shedding of the epithelium may result in the formation of superficial ulcers. In chronic cystitis the inflammatory changes extend throughout the whole thickness of the bladder wall and result in cirrhosis, whereby the elasticity of the organ is much impaired. The mucous membrane is of a slate or violet colour, is often roughened or villous, and bleeds readily, or it may be the seat of ulcers; when the urine is ammoniacal the surface is covered with a foul-smelling layer of phosphates and decomposing pus. In streptococcal infections the walls of the bladder may be studded with minute abscesses. The entire mucous membrane

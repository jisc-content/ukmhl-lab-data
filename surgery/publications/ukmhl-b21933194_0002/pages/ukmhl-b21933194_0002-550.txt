The latter factor is present in women past middle age who lead a sedentary life, and whose clothing, by com- pressing the abdomen, tends to interfere with respiratory movement. Stones in the Gall-Bladder and Cystic Duct. â€” Gall- stones are frequently found in the gall-bladder on post-mortem examination without having given rise to any symptoms during life. The occurrence of symptoms is partly determined by movement of the stone, but chiefly by the addition of inflamma- tion of the gall-bladder and of the parts in its vicinity.

Examination of the faeces immediately after an attack of colic may disclose one or more calculi, but this is exceptional.

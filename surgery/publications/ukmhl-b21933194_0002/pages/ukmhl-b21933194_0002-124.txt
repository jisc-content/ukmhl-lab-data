Percival Pott, in 1779, first described a disease of the spinal column which is characterised by erosion and destruction of the bodies of the vertebrae. It is liable to produce an angular deformity of the spine, and to be associated with abscess forma- tion and with nervous symptoms referable to pressure on the cord. This disease is now known to be tuberculous. It may occur at any period of life, but in at least 50 per cent, of cases it attacks children below the age of ten. Morbid Anatomy.—The tuberculous process may affect any portion of the spine, and as a rule is limited to one region, although in some cases foci of disease occur simultaneously at several levels. The disease may begin either in the interior of the bodies of the vertebrae—tuberculous osteomyelitis; or in the deeper layer of the periosteum on the anterior surface of the bones—tuberculous periostitis. Osteomyelitis is the form most frequently met with in children. The disease commences as a tuberculous infiltration of the marrow, which results in softening of the bodies of the affected vertebrae, particularly in their anterior parts, and, as the disease progresses, caseation and suppuration ensue, and the

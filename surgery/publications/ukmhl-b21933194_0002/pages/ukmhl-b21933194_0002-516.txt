THE INTESTINES. 496 forwarding its contents. The fact that the symptoms may not develop until after childhood does not disprove the congenital origin of the malady, which may only make itself evident when the musculature of the bowel becomes insufficient to propel the intestinal contents. The treatment consists in restricting the diet to what will leave little residue, and in systematically emptying the bowel by enemata. If surgical interference is called for, it would appear to be best to make an artificial anus in the descending colon in the first instance, and then, when the bowel has been completely emptied, to resect the affected portion of the colon or to establish an anastomosis between the lower end of the ileum and the lower part of the pelvic colon. Malignant Stricture—Cancer of the Bowel.—In the great majority of cases, this is associated with the growth of a columnar epithelioma originating in the mucous membrane of the large bowel. The tumour grows very slowly, and tends to spread cir- cularly around the gut. The epithelial elements usually undergo necrosis, while the fibrous stroma contracts, producing an annular stricture.

524 LIVER, GALL-BLADDER, AND BILE-DUCTS. beyond the free margin of the liver opposite the ninth or tenth costal cartilage. Under pathological conditions, it may be displaced farther to the right, or it may be found high up beneath the liver and completely covered by it. From the fundus, the bladder gradually narrows until its neck ends in a sigmoid curve, the terminal portion of which turns downwards to join the cystic duct near the right end of the transverse fissure of the liver. The fundus and inferior aspect of the bladder are invested by peritoneum ; the superior aspect is connected to the under surface of the liver by connective tissue, and under normal conditions is easily separated from it. The cystic duct passes backwards, down- Round Under surface of liver Duodenum portion) Right Suspensory muscle of duodenum Duodeno- jejunal junction Fig. 144.â€”The connections of the Biliary and Pancreatic Ducts.

The hepatic duct is formed by the junction of a branch from each lobe of the liver, issuing at the transverse fissure, and it descends within the gastro-hepatic omentum to join the cystic duct. The common bile-duct, formed by the junction of the hepatic and cystic ducts, is about three inches in length, and passes downwards and back- wards in the gastro-hepatic omentum, lying in front of the portal vein, and having the hepatic artery on its left side. Along its course are several lymphatic glands, which, in inflammatory affections of the biliary passages, may become enlarged and indurated, and may be mistaken for gall-stones when felt with the finger. If the finger is passed into the

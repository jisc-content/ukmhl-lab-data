174 THE JAWS, INCLUDING TEETH AND GUMS. eradicating the growth recurrence is very liable to occur, and in a majority of cases the disease sooner or later reappears. In the course of a few months, if there is no sign of recurrence, a plate carrying teeth should be fitted by the dentist to fill the gap and diminish the deformity. Simple tumours of the upper jaw are rare. Fibromata may originate in the periosteum or in the lining membrane of the antrum. They usually tend to assume the characters of sarco- mata. Chondromata usually begin either on the nasal surface of the bone or in the antrum. Osteomata occur in two forms : the exostosis, which may be composed of cancellated or of compact tissue, and the diffuse osteoma or leontiasis ossea (vol. i. p. 623).

(From Sir Patrick Heron Watson’s collection.) met with as in the upper jaw. The non-malignant forms—• osteoma, chondroma, and fibroma—are rare. A dentigerous cyst is frequently met with in the lower jaw. It appears as a smooth, rounded, and painless swelling, usually in the region of the molar teeth. The bone gradually becomes expanded and crackles on pressure. The cyst is filled with a glairy mucoid fluid, and may contain one or more unerupted teeth (Fig. 58). The treatment consists in removing the anterior wall of the cyst, scraping the interior, and packing the cavity with iodoform gauze. The myeloid tumour or myeloma is comparatively common. It develops in the interior of the bone and causes the affected segment to become expanded (Fig. 59). It grows slowly, is more or less encapsulated, and therefore does not infiltrate the surrounding tissues. Sometimes it so weakens the bone that pathological fracture occurs. There is no glandular

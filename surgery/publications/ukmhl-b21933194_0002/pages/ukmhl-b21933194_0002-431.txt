411 INGUINAL HERNIA. - Testis differentiated from hydrocele of the canal of Nnck, labial cyst, abscess, and various forms of tumour. Inguinal Hernia depending upon Congenital Anomalies in the Processus Vaginalis — Congenital Hernia. — As the testis descends into the scrotum in the course of normal development, it is ac- companied by a diverticulum of peritoneum called the processus vaginalis, the lowest portion of which becomes the tunica vaginalis, while the upper portion becomes obliterated at or before birth. Should the processus vaginalis remain patent throughout, it forms a ready-made hernial sac into which the abdominal contents may descend, and in the sac the contents Fig. 100.—Diagram of Congenital of the hernia are in contact with the Hernia, testis and entirely surround it. This is known as a congenital hernia (Fig. 100), is more common on the right side, because the right testis descends later than the left, and it frequently appears quite suddenly, the condition of the sac allowing the contents to pass at once into the scrotum. In young adults it not infre- quently becomes strangulated at its first emergence, and when strangulated is more difficult to reduce than the acquired variety. Constrictions, the re- sult of attempted closure at certain points, may give rise to an hour-glass sac. The con- stituents of the cord are found on the posterior aspect of the patent processus, and are more Fig. 101.—Diagram of Hernia into the closely attached to it than Funicular Process. they are to the sac of an ac- quired hernia. It is rarely possible by external examination to differentiate between an acquired and a congenital scrotal hernia.

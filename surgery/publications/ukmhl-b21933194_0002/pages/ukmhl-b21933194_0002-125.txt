105 POTT’S DISEASE. destructive process spreads to the adjacent intervertebral discs. In some cases—and particularly in the lumbar region—a distinct sequestrum is formed, either on the surface or in the interior of a vertebra. The pus usually works its way towards the front and sides of the bones, and burrows under the anterior common ligament. Less frequently it spreads towards the spinal canal and accumulates outside the dura, causing pressure on the cord. The compression of the diseased vertebrae by the weight of the body above the seat of the lesion, and by the traction of the muscles passing over it, produces a more or less acute angling of the spinal column. The anterior portions of the bodies being more ex- tensively destroyed, sink in, while the less damaged pos- terior portions and the intact articular processes prevent complete dislocation. In this way the integrity of the spinal canal is maintained, ancl the cord is protected from press- ure. The spinous processes of the affected vertebra project and form a prominence in the middle line of the back. When, as is usually the case, only one or two vertebra are implicated, this prominence takes the form of a sharp angular projection, while if several vertebra are involved, the deformity is of curve (Fig. 27). The periosteal form of vertebral tuberculosis is that most frequently met with in adults. The disease begins in the deeper layer of the periosteum on the anterior aspect of the vertebra, and extends along the surface of the bones, causing widespread superficial caries. It may attack the discs at their margins, and spread inwards between the discs and the contiguous vertebra. Owing to the comparatively wide area of the spine implicated, this form of the disease is not attended Fig. 27. — Tuberculous Osteomyelitis affecting several vertebrae at Dorso- lumbar Junction. the nature of a gentle backward

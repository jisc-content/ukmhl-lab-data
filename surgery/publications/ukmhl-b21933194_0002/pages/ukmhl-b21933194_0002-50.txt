Different forms of aphasia, interference with vision or with hearing, follow implication of the centres governing these functions. In the pre-frontal, and in the lower temporal con- volutions no special symptoms seem to follow. When the haemorrhages are extensive and numerous, symptoms of com- Fig. 8.—Contusion and Laceration of Brain.

Localised haemorrhages also occur, although less frequently, in the crura cerebri, the pons, the floor of the fourth ventricle, and the cerebellum. In these situations they usually prove fatal by causing rapidly advancing coma and interference with the respiratory and cardiac centres. The temperature immedi- ately rises to 106° or even 108° F., and a modified form of Cheyne-Stokes respiration is present. (3) Still more gross lesions, in the form of distinct lacerations,

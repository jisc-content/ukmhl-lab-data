MENINGITIS. 55 between them before exposing the parts by operation. The treatment is carried out on the same lines. Lepto-Meningitis.—The localised form of lepto-meningitis has already been referred to. Acute General Lepto-Meningitis.—In septic bone lesions, particularly compound fractures, infection of the arachno-pia may take place before protective adhesions form, with the result that a diffuse lepto-meningitis results. The open structure of the arachno-pial membrane favours the rapid spread of the inflammation, which may extend over the surface of the hemi- spheres, or downwards towards the base (basal meningitis), or in both directions. The process is at first attended with a copious effusion of cerebro-spinal fluid into the arachno-pial space and into the ventricles (serous lepto-meningitis), but this fluid rapidly tends to become purulent, the pus forming in a thin layer over the surface of the brain, and in the sulci between the convolutions (purulent lepto-meningitis). The membranes are congested and thickened, the veins of the arachno-pia engorged, and the superficial layers of the cortical grey matter may share in the inflammatory process (encephalitis). Clinical Features.—The earliest and most prominent symptom is the occurrence of violent pain in the head, often referred to the frontal region, or, in cases starting from middle ear disease, to the temporal region. This is accompanied by a sudden rise of temperature, usually without an antecedent rigor, and the temperature remains persistently elevated (102’-105° F.). The patient, especially if a child, is extremely irritable, all his sensations are hyperacute, and he periodically utters a peculiarly sharp, piercing cry.

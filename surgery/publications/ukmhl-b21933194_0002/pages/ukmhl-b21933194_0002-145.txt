125 SACRO-COCCYGEAL TUMOURS. Among other tumours met with in this region may be mentioned: the congenital lipoma—a small, rounded, fatty tumour which often suggests a caudal appendage (Fig. 39); the sacral hygroma, which forms a sessile cystic tumour growing over the back of the sacrum, and is believed to be a men- ingocele which has become cut off in utero by the continued growth of the spinal arch; sarcomata, lymphangiomata, and teratomata. The treatment consists in removing the tumour, if it is causing trouble. From the position of the wound, and the fact that many of these tumours extend into the hollow of the sacrum and therefore necessitate an extensive dissection, there is considerable risk from septic infection, especially in young children. The risk is increased when the tumour communicates with the spinal canal. Congenital Sacro - coccygeal Sinuses and Fistulse. — De- pressions and fistulse are occasionally met with in the sacro- coccygeal region. The post-anal dimple, a shallow depression frequently observed over the tip of the coccyx, may be due to traction exerted on the skin at this spot by the remains of the neurenteric canal, or by the caudal ligament of Luschka. Sometimes the integument is retracted to such an extent that one or more sinuses, lined with skin furnished with hairs, sweat, and sebaceous glands, are formed. In some cases the depression communicates with the spinal canal, constituting a complete sacro-coccygeal fistula, which may be lined with cylindrical or ciliated epithelium. From the accumulation of secretions and subsequent infection, these conditions may be associated with a persistent offensive discharge. They are best dealt with by complete excision, and as primary union cannot be expected, the wound should be treated by the open method.

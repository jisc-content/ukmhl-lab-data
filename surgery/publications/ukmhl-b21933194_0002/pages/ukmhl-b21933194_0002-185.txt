165 CHAPTER XI. THE JAWS, INCLUDING THE TEETH AND GUMS. Teeth : Dental caries. Gums : Gingivitis ; Pyorrhoea alveolaris ; Hypertrophy ; Epithelioma. Jaws : Inflammatory affections : Periostitis and osteomyelitis; Phosphorus necrosis; Tuberculosis; Syphilis; Actinomycosis—Tumours: Of alveolar process ; Of superior maxilla; Of inferior maxilla — Fracture of upper jaw — Fracture of lower jaw — Affections of the temporo-maxillary articulation: Dislocation of lower jaw ; Acute arthritis; Tuberculous arthritis; Arthritis deformans ; Closure of the jaw. Dental caries is a process of disintegration which begins on the surface of the enamel of a tooth—usually in the region of its neck—and gradually extends through the dentine till the pulp cavity is reached. Infection of the exposed pulp cavity by septic organisms may set up an acute purulent pulpitis. This is associated with severe pain, which is not confined to the diseased tooth, but may spread to the adjacent teeth, and sometimes to all the branches of the fifth nerve on the same side of the face. The inflammatory process may spread from the tooth to the alveolo-dental periosteum, and set up a periodontitis. In the affected tooth there is at first a feeling of uneasiness, which is relieved by the patient biting against it. Later there is severe lancinating or throbbing pain. The affected tooth usually pro- jects beyond its neighbours, and is excessively tender when the opposing tooth comes in contact with it in mastication. The gum becomes red and swollen, and the cheek is cedematous. Periodontitis is usually followed by the formation of an alveolar abscess. The pus which forms at the root of the tooth in most cases works its way through the bone and into the gum, constituting a “gum-boil.” The pus may then burst through the gum, or may spread underneath the external periosteum of the jaw and lead to necrosis of that bone.

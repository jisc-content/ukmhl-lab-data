PANCREATITIS. 541 pancreas, which cause the clinical phenomena of acute pancreatitis and lead to a fatal result. In disease of the pancreas associated with retention of its secretion, there is a marked tendency to the occurrence of haemorrhage into the gland substance or into the surrounding tissues, and this appears to be due to a necrotic effect of the secretion on the walls of the blood-vessels. In disease of the pancreas, and especially in acute pancreatitis, a condition is met with known as fat necrosis, in which the fat in certain parts of the body is split up into fatty acids and glycerine ; the glycerine being soluble, is absorbed, the fatty acids are deposited in a crystalline form within the fat cells and cause their necrosis. In time, the fatty acids unite with calcium to form lime salts. This change is met with Common bile duct Hepatic artery Gall-bladdei Duct of.

(After Spalteholtz.) chiefly in the fat round the pancreas, in the mesentery and omentum, and in the retro-peritoneal tissue, and is recognised by the occurrence of minute, opaque, white areas scattered through the fat. It appears to be due to the penetration of the fat-splitting ferment of the pancreatic juice into adipose tissue, when the passage of the secretion into the intestine is interfered with. When the common bile-duct is blocked at the ampulla of Vater, bile is forced back into the ducts of the pancreas and may play a part in the production of disease of that organ, especially if, as is usually the case under these conditions, the bile contains pyogenic bacteria. Pancreatitis.—The essential cause of the various forms of pancreatitis is bacterial infection, which usually reaches the glands by way of the duct, the organisms passing from the

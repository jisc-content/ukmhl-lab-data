The pus may perforate the diaphragm and enter the pleura, giving rise to empyema. The clinical features vary widely in different cases. There is usually a history of antecedent disease in one or other of the abdominal viscera. The prominent symptoms are those common to all forms of circumscribed intra-abdominal abscess, namely, pain, remittent fever, vomiting, progressive illness, with loss of appetite and strength. There is an increasing leucocytosis.

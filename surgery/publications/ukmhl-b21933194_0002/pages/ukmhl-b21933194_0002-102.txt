CHAPTER V. 82 DISEASES OF THE CRANIAL BONES. Suppurative Periostitis and Osteo-myelitis—Tuberculosis— Syphilis— Tumours. Suppurative Periostitis and Osteo-myelitis.—These condi- tions may be the result of infection through the blood-stream, but as a rule they are secondary to wounds, burns, or ulcers of the scalp, or to fractures that have become infected with pyogenic bacteria. Sometimes they follow suppuration in the middle ear and mastoid process. They are occasionally associated with acute cellulitis of the scalp. In some cases suppuration occurs on both aspects of the bone—a point of importance in treatment. The disease is usually ushered in by a rigor, and this is soon followed by the other signs of suppuration—high temperature, pain and tenderness, and the formation of a fluctuating swelling in relation to the bone. When pus forms between the bone and the dura, there is a characteristic oedema of the overlying area of the scalp—spoken of as Pott's puffy tumour—which is of great value as indicating the extent of the disease in the bone, and of the suppuration between it and the dura. When suppuration occurs under the pericranium, an incision gives exit to a quantity of pus, and exposes an area of bare bone. If the incision is made early, this bone may soon be covered by granulations and recover its vitality ; but if operation is delayed, it usually undergoes necrosis. The sequestrum which forms in- cludes, as a rule, only the outer table, but in some cases the whole thickness of the bone undergoes necrosis. In either case the separation of the sequestrum is an exceedingly slow process, and is not accompanied by the formation of new bone. When the whole thickness of the skull is lost, the gap usually becomes filled in by a dense fibrous membrane which is adherent to the dura mater. Serious complications, in the form of septic meningitis,

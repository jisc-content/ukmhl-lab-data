CANCER. 191 The disease is usually situated in the anterior half of the tongue, and more commonly on the edge than on the dorsum. The disease may begin as an indolent excoriation, ulcer, or fissure, as a warty growth, particularly in association with a patch of leucoplakia, or, less frequently, as a hard nodule beneath the mucous membrane. In all cases ulceration begins early, and the base of the ulcer and the surrounding parts become in- durated. The lymphatic glands are, as a rule, very early infected. Clinical Features. — The clinical appearances vary widely. Sometimes the surface pre- sents a warty growth ; some- times it is excavated, form- ing a deep ulcer with raised nodular edges ; in other cases the ulcer is smooth, and its edges even and rounded. Extreme hardness of the edges and of the base of the ulcer is always a character- istic feature. The tongue tends to become unduly fixed, especially when the disease spreads to the floor of the mouth, so that it cannot be protruded, and the restric- tion of its movement pro- duces a characteristic inter- ference with articulation, certain words being slurred, and when the fixation is ex- treme it may interfere with mastication and swallowing.

The patient complains of a constant gnawing pain in the tongue, and of severe pain shooting along the branches of the fifth nerve, and especially towards the ear. In the advanced stages there is profuse salivation and extreme foetor of the breath. When the disease is situated on the edge of the tongue it tends to spread to the floor of the mouth and to invade the lower jaw. If situated far back on the dorsum, it spreads towards the epiglottis, the pillars of the fauces, and the tonsil. The neighbouring lymphatic glands—particularly those under the jaw and along the line of the carotid vessels—soon become

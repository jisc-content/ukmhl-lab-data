ISCHIO-RECTAL ABSCESS. 581 tion a tense, elastic swelling, which does not encroach much on the bowel, can be detected in the ischio-rectal fossa. The symptoms may suddenly abate if the abscess bursts either into the rectum or on the surface, but the opening being small is liable to become blocked and the symptoms reappear. In some cases the recurrence of symptoms is due to the formation of an abscess in the ischio-rectal fossa of the opposite side. The pus which escapes may be yellow and creamy, or dark brown and grumous from admixture with broken-down blood-clot. It is always extremely foetid, and often contains putrefactive gases. When the abscess is tuberculous it runs a more chronic course. Treatment.—No time should be wasted by applying poultices, ice-bags, or other local applications, in the hope of aborting the abscess. As early as possible a crucial or T-shaped incision Ilium Acetabulum 'External sphincter Fin. 155.—Diagram of Ischio-rectal and Pelvi-rectal Abscesses. should be made into the abscess so as to lay it freely open, and the finger introduced and all septa broken down. The cavity is then purified and packed with iodoform worsted. The after- treatment is carried out on the lines already indicated for perianal abscess. The submucous abscess originates in the submucous tissue of the lower part of the rectum, and is usually due either to injury of the mucous membrane by a foreign body, or to a tear or ulcer near the base of a polypus or pile. The pus is almost always confined to one lateral aspect of the bowel, and it tends to burrow towards the anus, and to burst close to the anal margin, forming a short and shallow blind internal fistula (Fig. 159a). The symptoms resemble those of an ischio-rectal abscess, but there is no external swelling. On digital examination a soft, fluctuating swelling can be felt bulging towards the bowel. This

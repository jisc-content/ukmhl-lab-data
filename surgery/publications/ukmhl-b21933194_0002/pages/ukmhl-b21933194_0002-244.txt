The capillaries of the skin are dilated and tortuous, and the nose assumes a bluish-red colour, and its surface is soft and greasy. The condition is met with in elderly men, and the masses appear to be chiefly com- posed of sebaceous adenomata. The term lipoma nasi, formerly employed, is therefore misleading. Fig. 67.—Rhinophyma or Lipoma Nasi in man aged 65. The treatment consists in paring away the protuberant masses until the normal size and contour of the nose are re- stored, care being taken not to encroach on the cartilages or on the orifices of the nostrils. There is comparatively little bleeding and the raw surface rapidly becomes covered by epidermis. Examination of the Nasal Cavities.—For the examination of the interior of the nose the following appliances are necessary : A reflector, such as is used in laryngoscopy, attached to a forehead band or spec- tacle frame ; one of the various forms of nasal speculum ; a long, pliable probe ; a tongue depressor ; and a small-sized mirror. As additional aids, a 10 per cent, solution of cocain, a grooved probe as a cotton-wool holder,

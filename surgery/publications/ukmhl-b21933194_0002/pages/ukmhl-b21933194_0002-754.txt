730 THE PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES. The disease is chronic and painless, and is only recognised on rectal examination; the vesicle is so thickened that it resembles a solid, cake-like mass, and is not at all tender on pressure. A cold abscess may form and burrow in various directions, and tuberculous peritonitis is an occasional complication. Prognosis and treatment are influenced by the same con- siderations as in tuberculosis of the prostate. Surgical measures directed to the vesicular disease are rarely called for. When an abscess has formed it is reached by the perineal route.

In aggra- vated cases, the os incisivum and prolabium are adherent to the end of the nose. In these cases there is a Y shaped cleft in the palate. Cleft Palate. — It has already been mentioned that the palate is formed by the blending of the two palatal plates of the maxillary pro- cesses with the four segments of the premaxillary bone, derived from the nasal pro- cesses. The anterior pala- tine foramen marks the point Fig. 46.—Double Hare-lip in a girl ait. 17. which these elements of the palate unite. The pro- cess of fusion begins in front and spreads backwards, the two halves of the uvula being the last part to unite. As development may be arrested at any point, several varieties of cleft palate are met with. The uvula, for example, maybe bifid, or the cleft may extend throughout the soft palate. In more severe cases, it extends into the hard palate as far forward as the anterior palatine fora- men. In these varieties the whole cleft is mesial. In still more aggravated cases, the cleft passes farther forward, deviat- Fig. 47.—Double Hare-lip with Projection of Premaxillary Bone, in an infant before first dentition.

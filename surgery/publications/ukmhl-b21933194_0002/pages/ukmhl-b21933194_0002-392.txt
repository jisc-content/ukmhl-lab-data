THE PERITONEUM. 372 having been previously shut off by adhesions. The abscess is usually situated on the same side of the body as the organ from which the original infection proceeded. Abscess on the right side (Fig. 91), for example, most often originates from lesions of the liver, bile-ducts, vermiform appendix, or right kidney, or from infective conditions of the right pleural cavity or thoracic wall; while abscess on the left side (Fig. 92) results from lesions of the stomach, left pleura, or left thoracic wall.

The abscess may contain pus only, or pus and gas, the gas being derived from the perforation of a hollow organ, such as the stomach, or, as is more frequently the case, being formed within the abscess as a result of bacterial decomposition. The sub-phrenic abscess which follows upon lesions of the vermiform appendix is practically always on the right side, and it may be extra- or intra-peritoneal. When extra-peritoneal, it is due to an infection spreading upwards in the cellular tissue behind the ascending colon, or between the layers of the ascend- ing meso-colon. When intra-peritoneal, it is usually a sequel of

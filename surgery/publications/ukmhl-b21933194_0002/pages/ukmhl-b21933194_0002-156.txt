From the maxillary process are developed the cheeks, certain of the facial bones, the lateral portions of the upper lip, the soft and hard palate (with the exception of the Prosencephalon.

Hare-lip is a congenital notch or fissure in the substance of the upper lip, and cleft palate a congenital defect in the roof of the mouth. Either of these conditions may exist alone, but they occur so frequently in combination that it is convenient to con- sider them together. In hare-lip the cleft may be median or lateral, and it may or may not be associated with a cleft in the palate. The re- semblance to the Y-shaped cleft in the upper lip of the hare, suggested by the name, is in most cases only superficial. Median hare-lip is extremely rare. It occurs in two forms ; one in which there is a simple cleft in the middle of the lip, the result of non-union of the two globular processes of the mesial nasal process; another in which there is a wide gap due to entire absence of the parts developed from the mesial nasal process— the central portion of the lip, the inner segment of the pre-

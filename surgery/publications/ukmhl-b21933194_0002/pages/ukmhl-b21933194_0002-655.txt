PYONEPHROSIS. 631 to the outflow of urine. It represents, therefore, a combination of retention and infection. It is met with as a sequel to hydronephrosis—“infected hydronephrosis ”; aud as a sequel of stone in the pelvis of the kidney—“calculous pyonephrosis.” In these the infection is usually derived from the blood, the dis- ease is unilateral, and the affected organ may attain a considerable size (Fig. 170). It is also met with as a sequel to septic cystitis, especially when the hindrance to the outflow of urine is a stricture of the urethra or enlargement of the prostate, or frequent spasmodic contraction of the bladder, as in gonor- rhoeal or puerperal cystitis. Under all these conditions the pyonephrosis is bi- lateral, although it is fre- quently more advanced on one side. The infection is commonly an ascending one, taking place by way of the ureter, and being favoured by the increased backward pressure (Fig. 169). As a result of chronic inflammation, the walls of the ureter become thickened and fused with the peri- toneum and surrounding tissues, and the lumen is usually dilated, although sometimes it is narrowed. Morbid anatomy.—On section the kidney presents a number of abscess cavities, the intervening parenchyma being pale and tough as a result of chronic interstitial nephritis. Unless there has been antecedent hydronephrosis, the pelvis is usually small in proportion to the greatly enlarged and flask-shaped calyces, which constitute the abscess cavities and form the chief bulk of Fig. 169.—Bilateral pyonephrosis with dila- tation and thickening of the ureters, re- sulting from gonorrhoeal cystitis in a girl aged 18.

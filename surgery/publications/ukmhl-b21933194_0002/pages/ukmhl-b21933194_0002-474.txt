THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM. 454 passed and the organ washed out with a known quantity of fluid, the loss of a certain amount will be observed when the return fluid is measured, the lost fluid having passed from the cardiac into the pyloric compartment (Wolfler). After the stomach has been washed out until the fluid returns clear, a sudden, unexpected gush of dirty, fermented stomach contents makes its appearance, due to reflux from the pyloric compart- ment (Wolfler). After washing out the stomach with the tube, splashing may still be elicited in the epigastric region, the pyloric segment not having been emptied. This phenomenon has been called “ paradoxical dilatation ” by Jaworski. On the stomach being distended with air, a distinct sulcus may be recognised separating the two pouches, and if the two halves of a Seidlitz powder are separately given, a loud forcible gushing Fig. 117.—Hour-glass Contraction of tlie Stomach following Gastric Ulcer. sound can be easily heard with the stethoscope at a point two or three inches to the left of the middle line (von Eiselsberg). The treatment is operative, and the procedure suitable to a given case can only be decided upon after the stomach has been exposed and the exact nature of the deformity discovered. When the isthmus is near the centre of the stomach, and the compartments are not much dilated, a gastroplasty carried out on the same lines as pyloroplasty may suffice. When the isthmus is near the lesser curvature, and the compartments sag downwards so that they meet below the isthmus, gastro- anastomosis—that is, the establishment of a communication between the lower part of the two pouches—is indicated. If the pylorus is stenosed, gastro-enterostomy will be required in addition, and in some cases each compartment must be united to the intestine to provide for the efficient drainage of both. When the isthmus is the seat of cancer it must be resected, and

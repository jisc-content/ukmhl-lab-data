122 DISEASES OF THE SPINE AND CORD. Fig. 37.—Meningo-myelocele of Cervical Spine. dilatation of the central canal in the protruded part of the cord. In these three forms the protrusion may be covered by healthy skin, or by a thin, smooth, translucent membrane through which the con- tents are visible. Frequently this thin covering sloughs or ulcerates, and permits the cerebro - spinal fluid to drain away. (4) In the myelocele, the skin, as well as the vertebral arches and membranes, is absent, and the cord lies exposed on the surface. This form is com- paratively common, but as the infants are either dead born or die within a few days of birth, it seldom comes under the notice of the surgeon. Clinical Features.—The pres- ence in the middle line of the back of a swelling, which has existed since birth, which contains fluid, and which increases in size and tenseness when the child cries or coughs, renders the diagnosis of spina bifida comparatively easy. The swelling is usually sessile, but may be pedunculated; it is usually possible to palpate the edges of the gap in the bones. The swelling may be reduced in size by making gentle pressure over it, and in young children this may cause a bulging of the fontanelles. This test, however, must be em- ployed with caution, as it is liable to induce convulsions. A menin- gocele, as it contains no nerve elements, may be translucent. In a meningo-myelocele the shadows of the cord and nerves stretched out in the sac may be recognised. The presence of the cord is some- times indicated by a median furrow over the surface of the swelling, and after withdrawal of some of the fluid the cord Fig. 38.—Meningocele in Cervical Region.

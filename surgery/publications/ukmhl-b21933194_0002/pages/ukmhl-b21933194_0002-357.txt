CARCINOMA. 337 defined tumour of stony hardness may be felt in the substance of the breast. Not being encapsulated, it cannot be moved apart from the breast. When firmly pressed against the chest wall with the flat of the hand, the tumour becomes more evident, and its stony hardness is fully appreciated. The skin over the growth may for a long time remain free, but, as the disease progresses, it becomes tacked down, and is later dimpled by contraction of the suspensory liga- ments of Cooper (Fig. 89). When the skin becomes invaded by the tumour, it assumes a characteristically coarse and indur- ated appearance, aptly compared to that of the skin of an orange or to pig’s skin. When the tumour is near the centre of the breast, it causes re- traction of the nipple by dragging on the large ducts. Glandular infec- tion may take place at any time in the course of the disease. In many cases, and particularly in fat women, the glands cannot be palpated through the skin even although they are enlarged. Glandular enlargement is usually most marked in ulcerating cancers. The pectoral group are usually the first to become enlarged, later the axillary, the sub-clavicular, the supra-clavicular, and the subscapular groups are infected. In course of time the enlargement and matting together of the axillary glands, by obstructing the lymph flow and pressing on the large veins, leads to great swelling of the upper extremity (Fig. 90). The nerve trunks also are pressed upon and severe pain results. Fig. 90.—Advanced Ulcerating Cancer of Breast, with extensive involvement of the Lymphatics causing elephantiasis of the arm.

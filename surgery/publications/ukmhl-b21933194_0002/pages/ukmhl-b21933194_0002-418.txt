398 HERNIA. The contents may be represented by any of the structures within the abdomen. The small intestine and the great omentum are those most commonly present. When intestine alone is pro- truded, the hernia is termed an enterocele; when omentum only, an epiplocele. The term Richter's hernia is applied when only a part of the circumference of the intestine is protruded (Fig. 96). A Littre's hernia is one containing a Meckel’s diverticulum. Fluid derived from the peritoneal cavity may be present in the sac, particularly in cases of tuberculous and other forms of ascites.

The structures within the hernial sac may become adherent to one another or to the inner surface of the sac. The omentum is specially liable to become fixed by adhesions, while the intes- tine, in virtue of its greater range of movement, more often remains free. The protruded omentum may undergo a con- siderable increase in bulk from deposit of fat in its substance, and in hernise of long standing may become tough and fibrous, particularly when pressed upon by a truss. Clinical Conditions of Hernia. A hernia may be reducible, irreducible, obstructed, or strangulated. A reducible hernia is one in which the contents of the sac

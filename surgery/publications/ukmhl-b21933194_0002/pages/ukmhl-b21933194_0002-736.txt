712 THE PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES. the minute opening of the common ejaculatory duct, which traverses the substance of the prostate from behind forwards. The lymphatics arise in the substance of the gland and form around it a network which communicates with the lymphatics of the bladder, the urethra, and seminal vesicles. The prostate is composed of slightly branched, tubular glands, lined by columnar epithelium and embedded in a stroma which is largely composed of unstriped muscle. The gland tubules lead into the minute prostatic ducts, which, to the number of about twenty, open, for the most part, on the posterior wall of the urethra. The secretion serves to lubricate the urethra and to dilute the seminal fluid ; and when the prostate is compressed by the levatores ani, as in straining during defecation, it may be forced along the urethra and Fig. 189.—Section of enlarged Prostate, showing intra-vesical projection of middle lobe and retro-prostatic pouch. appear at the meatus as a clear viscid fluid ; under conditions of sexual excitement it is poured into the urethra and may drip from the meatus. The evolution of the prostate is closely related to that of the sexual functions, and begins at puberty at the same time as that of the testes. When the sexual functions are on the wane, the gland is liable to undergo an enlargement, which constitutes the most important disease of the organ. Pain in prostatic affections is referred to the lower part of the back— across the base of the sacrum—and to the perineum and rectum ; when the prostatic urethra is involved, the pain is referred to the point of the penis. Examination of the Prostate from the Rectum.-—The patient should if possible bend over the back of a chair, resting his hands on the seat so that the trunk forms a right angle with the lower extremities. If the patient is unable to leave his bed, the examination is made in the dorsal position. The finger, protected with a thin rubber finger-stall

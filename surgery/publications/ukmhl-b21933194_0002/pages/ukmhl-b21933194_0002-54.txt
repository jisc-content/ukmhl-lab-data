34 THE CRANIUM AND ITS CONTENTS. necessary to ligate the external carotid artery. It has been suggested by J. B. Murphy that, when the patient is seen while the symptoms of compression are coming on, instead of trephin- ing, the haemorrhage from the meningeal vessels should be arrested by applying a ligature to the external carotid, under .local anaesthesia. Injury to the internal carotid artery within the skull may Fig. 9. â€” Extra-Dural Clot resulting from haemorrhage from the middle meningeal artery. Note fissured fracture of skull and compression of brain by the blood-clot. (After Jonathan Hutchinson.) result from penetrating wounds, or may be associated with a fracture of the base. It is almost invariably fatal. In some cases a communication is established between the artery and the cavernous sinus, and an arterio-venous aneurysm is thus produced. Ligature of the internal carotid in the neck or of the common carotid is the only feasible treatment. Injuries of the venous sinuses sometimes result from fractures of the skull and from penetrating wounds. The lateral, superior longitudinal, and cavernous sinuses are those most frequently damaged. On account of the low pressure in the sinuses,

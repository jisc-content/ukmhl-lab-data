Pyogenic Diseases.1 The most important intra-cranial diseases which result from infection with pyogenic bacteria are : meningitis, abscess of the brain, and phlebitis of the venous sinuses. The organisms most frequently associated with these conditions are the staphylococcus aureus and the streptococcus, but it is not uncommon to meet with mixed infections in which other bacteria are present—particularly the pneumococcus, the bacillus foetidus, the bacillus coli, and the bacillus pyocyaneus. By far the most common source of intra-cranial infection is chronic suppuration of the middle ear and mastoid antrum, the organisms passing from these cavities to the interior of the skull directly through a perforation of the tegmen tympani or of the wall of the sigmoid groove, or being carried in the blood-stream by the emissary veins. In some cases the infection travels along the sheaths of the facial and auditory nerves. Septic conditions of the nasal cavity and its accessory air sinuses, and compound fractures of the skull, particularly punctured fractures, also are liable to be followed by intra- cranial complications. Infection may be conveyed to the inside of the skull, by way of the emissary veins, from septic wounds of the scalp, or from such infective conditions as erysipelas of the face and scalp, malignant pustule, carbuncles, or boils. 1 We desire here to acknowledge our indebtedness to Sir William Macewen’s work on Pyogenic Infective Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord.

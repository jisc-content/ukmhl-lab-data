547 CYSTS OF THE PANCREAS. sometimes attain a large size, holding several pints of a brown or greenish, turbid, watery fluid, of alkaline reaction, containing albumin and globulin and pigments derived from the blood. In exceptional cases the cyst is really a localised tuberculous peritonitis. Clinical Features.—A pancreatic cyst forms a rounded or oval, fluctuating, and slightly movable abdominal tumour, situated at or above the level of the umbilicus, chiefly to the left of the middle line. The signs on percussion vary with its relation to adjacent organs, but there is usually a central area of dulness surrounded by a tympanitic zone. The cyst may extend forwards, and come into relation with the abdominal wall in one or other of three situations (Kbrte) : (1) It most commonly projects directly forward, filling the lesser sac of the peritoneum, displacing the stomach upwards against the liver, and the transverse colon downwards (Fig. 147). (2) The cyst may pro- ject forward between the stomach and liver, pushing in front of it the lesser or gastro-hep- atic omentum (Fig. 148). (3) The cyst may insinuate itself between the layers of the transverse mesocolon, so that the colon comes to lie directly in front of the cyst (Fig. 149), or above or below it. If the stomach be distended with gas, its relations to the cyst are readily demonstrated. The symptoms of which the patient complains are mainly due to pressure. Thus, for example, he may suffer from in- digestion and vomiting, from pressure on the stomach; breath- lessness, from pressure on the diaphragm ; disturbance of the bowels, from pressure on the colon. A cyst in the head of the pancreas may press on the common bile-duct and cause jaundice. In true cysts of the pancreas, loss of flesh is usually a prominent symptom. The diagnosis is to be made from a mesenteric or ovarian cyst and from tumours of the kidney. Fig. 149.—Pancreatic Cyst below the Stomach and crossed by Transverse Colon.

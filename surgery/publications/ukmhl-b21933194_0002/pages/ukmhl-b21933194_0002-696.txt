The stone may form a cast of a portion of the bladder with which it lies in contact 5 many stones, for example, present a groove on the lower aspect due to- the inter-ureteral bar. When a stone lies partly in the bladder and partly in the prostatic urethra, it may present a characteristic hour-glass con- striction corresponding to the junction of the two cavities (Fig. 186). An elongated stone suggests that it has formed around a foreign body. Fig. 184.—Oxalate of Lime or Mulberry Sources of Origin.—The Calculus. Natural size. great majority of calculi found (From Professor Annandale's Collection.) in tlie bladder have descended from the kidney, and after entering the bladder have increased in size. The minority take origin in the bladder, most commonly by the precipitation of phosphates as a result of alkaline decomposition of the urine. The forma- tion of stones around foreign bodies affords the most striking example of the latter method of origin (Fig. 181). Little is known of the rate of growth of vesical stones in general, but foreign bodies may become en- crusted with phosphates in a few days, and a pI0- ^35.—Faceted Phospliatic Stones from a stone of considerable size case of septic cystitis complicating enlarged may be formed in this prostate.

Relations to the Bladder.—A stone usually lies free in the cavity of the bladder and alters its position with the attitude of the patient. A very large stone tends to become fixed by the

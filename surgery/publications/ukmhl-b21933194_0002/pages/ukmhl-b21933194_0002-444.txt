HEKNIA. 424 children. The protrusion of peritoneum may occur at any part of the umbilical scar, or in its vicinity, in the latter case the hernia being, strictly speaking, of the ventral type. The opening in the abdominal wall is usually circular, and is bounded by the fused aponeuroses of the abdominal muscles. The muscles are weak and flabby, and the recti widely separated. The contents usually consist of omentum, while the larger varieties contain the transverse colon, and less frequently small intestine. The omentum always lies in front, and may form a complete lining to the peritoneal sac. Sometimes there are two separate open- ings leading into a common hernial sac, which is not infrequently divided into loculi, a fact which it is important to remember, Fia. 110.â€”Mesial Section through Umbilical Hernia, showing sac filled with adherent omentum ; removed by operation. since intestine may be strangulated in one of these loculi and be perfectly free in another. The formation of the hernia is always associated with pro- gressive adiposity. It may be that the deposition of fat in the abdominal wall, taking place uniformly except in the umbilical cicatrix, causes stretching of this structure, so that it yields more readily to increased intra-abdominal pressure; or it may be that the fat deposited in the omentum tends to send out protrusions of its substance through weak points in the cicatrix. The hernia develops gradually, and forms a smooth, globular, painless swelling. As it increases in size it may become lobulated, from adhesions forming between the contents and the wall of the sac. The umbilical scar, stretched and bulging, is usually seen on the lower half of the swelling. Large hernia: become pendulous, and may hang down over the pubes. The expansile

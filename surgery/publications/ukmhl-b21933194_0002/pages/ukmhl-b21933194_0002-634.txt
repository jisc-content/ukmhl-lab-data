THE KIDNEY AND URETER. 610 the urine with blood, pyuria an admixture with pus. The term bacteri- uria is employed when the urine contains micro - organisms, and albuminuria when albumin is present. Methods of Examination.—Palpation.—The kidneys can only be palpated through the abdominal wall if enlarged or unduly movable. The patient rests on his back, with the head and shoulders raised and the thighs acutely flexed to relax as far as possible the abdominal muscles. One hand of the observer is placed in the loin below the ribs, and the other on the anterior abdominal wall, and while the region of the kidney is being palpated the patient is asked to take deep breaths. Fig. 163.—Outline Diagram of Kidneys as seen from behind. (After Stiles, Cunningham’s Text-Boot.) The same procedure is repeated in the lateral position. If the kidney is enlarged it is felt to project beyond the costal margin, and if it is movable it slips up and down with respiration and tends to fall towards the middle line when the patient lies on the opposite side. Anaesthesia is a valuable aid to palpation, especially when the muscles cannot be voluntarily relaxed. Percussion may be useful in differentiating tumours of the kidney from those of the liver, intestine, or spleen, and in determining the position of the colon in relation to a supposed renal tumour. On the right side the ascending colon lies along the inner side of a renal tumour ; on the'left, the descending colon crosses in front of it.

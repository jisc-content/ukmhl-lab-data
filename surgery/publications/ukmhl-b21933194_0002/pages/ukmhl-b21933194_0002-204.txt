184 THE JAWS, INCLUDING TEETH AND GUMS. of the forms of arthritis, is also comparatively common. The ankylosis may be fibrous or osseous, and may be intra- or extra- articular. The clinical features vary with the degree of separation of the jaws. There is always some deformity, and more or less interference with mastication and speech. Owing to the patient’s inability to cleanse the mouth particles of food lodge and de- compose there, causing irritation of the mucous membrane and foetor of the saliva and breath. When osseous ankylosis occurs in childhood, it leads to an arrest of development of the lower jaw, which is small and markedly receding, so that the teeth do not oppose those of the upper jaw. Treatment.—When the cause of the fixation is in the joint itself, the best treatment is to resect one or both condyles. An incision is made along the lower border of the zygoma; the parotid gland is retracted along with the branches of the facial nerve ; the joint is exposed by clearing away the posterior fibres of the masseter, and the condyle divided by a Gigli’s wire-saw or an osteotome. The attachment of the external pterygoid is then separated and the condyle removed, but the meniscus is retained. In some cases these measures are insufficient, and it is necessary to resect the condyle, the coronoid process, and a portion of the ascending ramus. When the fixation is due to cicatricial contraction of the soft parts, mobility is best restored by forming an artificial joint well in front of the cicatricial tissue, as suggested by Esmarch. This is effected by excising a wedge of bone, with its base downwards, from the horizontal ramus, the base of the wedge measuring about an inch To prevent the bone reuniting, the masseter and internal pterygoid muscles should be stitched across the gap between the ends, and active and passive movements must be carried out from the first.

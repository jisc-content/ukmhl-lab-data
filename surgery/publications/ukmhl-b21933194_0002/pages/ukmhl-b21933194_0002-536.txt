THE INTESTINES. 514 A solitary tumour, unless when seated in the rectum, rarely gives rise to symptoms; it may, however, form the starting-point of an intussusception. Adenomata are sometimes met with in the form of polypi disseminated throughout the colon and rectum. This affection is met with chiefly in young adults, and is attended with diarrhoea, loss of blood, abdominal pain, and sometimes with symptoms of stenosis. There is a tendency to cancerous transformation of one or other of the adenomatous tumours. The sufferings of the patient may be greatly relieved by anasto- mosing the lower ileum with the sigmoid flexure.

Lipomata and fibromata rarely cause symptoms unless by giving rise to intussusception or stenosis of the bowel. Malignant disease of the intestine is described at p. 496.

The term splanchnoptosis may be used to indicate downward displacement of all the abdominal organs, enteroptosis being reserved for those cases in which the bowel alone is displaced. The transverse colon may descend to the level of the sym- physis, and the stomach may be found anywhere between the

The results, however, have not been encouraging. Chronic Hydrocephalus.—Chronic external hydrocephalus is rare, and usually results from some definite intra-cranial lesion, such as meningitis, tumour, or cerebral atrophy. It is not amenable to surgical treatment. Chronic internal hydrocephalus, on the other hand, is a comparatively common condition. It may be of congenital origin, or may develop in young rickety children, usually as a result of some chronic inflammatory process in the membranes Fig. 19.—Hydrocephalus in a child aged 3^. at the base, the choroid plexuses, or the ependyma of the ventricles, causing obstruction to the outflow of blood through the veins of Galen. The communication between the ventricles and the subarachnoid space, by way of the foramen of Magendie, becomes obstructed, so that the cerebro-spinal fluid is pent up in the ventricles and gradually distends them. The pressure causes the head to enlarge, the fontanelles to bulge, and the bones to be separated from one another, the intervals between the bones being occupied by a thin trans- lucent membrane. The cerebral tissue is greatly thinned out, but the cerebellum and cranial nerves usually remain unaffected. The appearance of the patient is characteristic (Fig. 19).

When the last few inches of ileum incline up- wards, forming an obtuse angle with the caecum, a prolapse of the ileo-caecal valve into the colon would be directed upwards, and would lie in such an attitude that the peristalsis of the colon would tend to increase the tumour by drawing it upwards towards the hepatic flexure.

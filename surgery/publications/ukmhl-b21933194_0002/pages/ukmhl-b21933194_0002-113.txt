93 TRAUMATIC LESIONS OF THE CORD. Later Symptoms.—These are the result of descending degenera- tion taking place in the antero-lateral columns of the cord. There are often violent and painful jerkings of the muscles of the limbs, and the muscles become rigid and the limbs flexed. After a time the reaction of degeneration is exhibited by the paralysed muscles. Injuries of the Cord at different Levels.—Cervical Region.— Complete lesions of the first four cervical segments—that is above the level of the disc between the third and fourth cervical verte- brae—are always rapidly, if not instantaneously, fatal, as respira- tion is at once arrested by the destruction of the fibres of the Fig. 23.—Attitude of Upper Extremities in Traumatic Lesions of the Sixth Cervical Segment. The prominence of the abdomen is due to gaseous dis- tension of the bowel. phrenic nerve. It is from this cause that death results in judicial hanging. In lesions between the fifth cervical and first dorsal segments inclusive, all four limbs are paralysed. Sensation is lost below the second intercostal space. The parts above this level retain sensation as they are supplied by the supra-clavicular nerves which are derived from the fourth cervical segments. Recession of the eyeballs, narrowing of the palpebral fissures, and con- traction of the pupils, result from paralysis of the cervical sympathetic. Respiration is almost exclusively carried on by the diaphragm, and hiccup is often persistent. There is at first retention of urine, followed by dribbling from overflow, and sugar is sometimes found in the urine. Priapism is common.

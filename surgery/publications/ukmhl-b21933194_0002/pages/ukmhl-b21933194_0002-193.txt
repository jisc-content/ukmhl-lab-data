After the bleeding has been arrested by forceps, the cartilage of the nose is separated from the nasal process of the maxilla, the periosteum of the lioor of the orbit freed, and a copper spatula placed between it and the bone to protect the eye from injury. The jaw is then divided at its junction with the malar bone, at its articulation with the nasal process of the frontal, and in the middle line between its palatal processes.

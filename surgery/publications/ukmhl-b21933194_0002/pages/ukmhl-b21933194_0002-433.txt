413 INGUINAL HERNIA. uncommon, especially in children. The testis may be retained within the abdomen, or, as is more usual, may occupy some part of the inguinal canal. The testis is imperfectly developed, and may be exceedingly sensitive. In the majority of cases the hernia comes down before the testicle (Fig. 104); next in frequency the hernia and testis descend simultaneously; exceptionally the testis descends first, and is followed after a variable interval by the hernia. In the treatment of this condition, an attempt may be made by means of a truss provided with a horseshoe-shaped pad to retain the hernia while allow- ing the testicle to descend, but this is seldom practicable. Operative treatment is more satisfactory; the testis and cord are freed from their coverings, and the former is brought down to and fixed in the scrotum. The process of peritoneum is the internal ring, and the walls -Bowel -Sac Fig. 104.—Hernia with imper- fectly descended Testis. then divided and closed at of the inguinal canal brought together. Congenital Hernia in the Female.—A process of peri- toneum—the canal of Nuck —accompanies the round liga- ment in the foetus, and is usually obliterated at birth. If it remains patent and a hernia descends into it, this is known as a hernia into the canal of Nuck. The sac not infrequently contains the ovary and Fallopian tube. The canal may remain patent, however, without a hernia developing. Direct Inguinal Hernia. —This variety of hernia is always acquired. It leaves the abdomen at the semilunar line between the epigastric artery and the outer edge of the rectus muscle (Hesselbach’s triangle) and enters at the lower part of the inguinal canal, splitting or carrying in front of it the con- Fig. 105.—Single Spiral Truss for Riglit Oblique Inguinal Hernia.

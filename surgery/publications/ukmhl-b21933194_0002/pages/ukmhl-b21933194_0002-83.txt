63 SINUS PHLEBITIS. to lodge in the lung or pleura, and set up pulmonary abscess, gangrene of the lung, or empyema. Clinical Features.—In all cases pain in the head, referred to the region of the affected sinus, and so severe as to prevent sleep, is an early and prominent feature. The patient is usually excited, hypersensitive, and irritable in the early stages, and becomes dull and even comatose towards the end. Rigors, followed by profuse perspiration, occur early, and increase in frequency as the disease progresses. The temperature is markedly remittent, varying from 103° to 106 F. The pulse is rapid, small, and thready. Loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhoea are almost constant symptoms.

Phlebitis of Individual Sinuses.—Th^lateral or sigmoid sinus, on account of its proximity to the middle ear and mastoid air cells, is that most commonly affected, especially in young adults. With the onset of the phlebitis the discharge from the ear stops. There is severe pain in the ear and violent headache. The temperature rises, but shows marked remissions, and rigors are common. Vomiting is frequently present. Turgescence of the scalp veins draining into this sinus, and oedema over the mastoid, are occasionally observed, but as they accompany various other conditions, are of little diagnostic value. Not infrequently phlebitis spreads to the internal jugular vein, which may then be felt as a firm, tender cord running down the neck. The head is held rigid, sometimes in the position of torticollis.

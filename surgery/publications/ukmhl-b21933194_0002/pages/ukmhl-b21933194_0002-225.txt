205 TUMOURS. are very malignant, grow rapidly, infiltrate surrounding parts, including the skin, and infect the adjacent lymphatic glands. There is severe neuralgic pain, and paralysis from involve- ment of the facial nerve is an early symptom. Recurrence is very liable to occur after removal. The treatment consists in excising the whole of the parotid gland with the tumour, no attempt being made to conserve the facial nerve or other structures traversing the gland, and as it is not certain, even then, that all the outlying processes of the tumour are removed, the raw surface should be seared with the cautery or cauterised with arsenical paste. Recourse may be had to the use of the X-rays after operation. The submaxillary and sublingual glands may be the seat of the same varieties of tumour as the parotid. These glands are particularly liable to become invaded along with the adjacent lymphatic glands in cancer of the tongue.

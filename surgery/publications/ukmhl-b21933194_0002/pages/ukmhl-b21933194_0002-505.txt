INTUSSUSCEPTION. 485 sheath, receiving tube, or intussuscipiens; an internal, known as the entering tube; and a middle, known as the returning tube. The internal and middle together constitute the intussusception. The etiology of intussusception has been the subject of much con- troversy. The view most commonly held is that while a segment of gut is in a condition of spasmodic contraction, the flaccid gut below is drawn up over it by a contraction of the longitudinal muscular fibres. Once the invag- ination has commenced, its increase is due to ex- aggerated peristalsis forc- ing the intussusceptum further along the bowel, as if it were a foreign body. Clinical ex- perience supports this as- sociation of intussuscep- tion with disturbance of the normal peristaltic movement; for example, its following on the taking of indigestible food, and upon attacks of chronic diarrhoea in children in whom the bowel is excep- tionally irritable. Morbid Anatomy.— As a type of intussuscep- tion we shall take the ileo- ccecal form as it occurs in children, in which the ileum and caecum are in- vaginated into the colon and the ileo-caecal valve forms the apex of the intruding portion. Once the invagination has commenced, it increases at the expense of the receiving tube, the apex remaining the same and folding more and more of the sheath over it as it passes down. This variety often attains considerable dimensions, and, in infants, the apex of the intussusceptum may traverse the whole length of the colon and actually protrude at the anus. The frequency of intussusception at the ileo-ctecal junction is due partly to the Fia. 128.—Ileo-CEecal Intussusception. The ensheatliing colon has been laid open.

The fistula may result from the bursting of a perianal abscess, in which case the channel is comparatively short and entirely subcutaneous, and the opening lies close to the anal margin (Fig. 158a). In other cases it follows an ischio-rectal abscess, the sinus being deeper, and the opening farther away from the anus (Fig. 1586). After the symptoms referable to the ab- scess subside, the sinus discharges a small amount of thin sero-pus. The open- ing frequently closes up, and the discharge is retained for a day or two, but soon bursts out again. In some cases fresh ex- ternal openings form in the anal region, and in others the pus burrows into the rectum, and the fistula becomes complete. In cases of blind external fistula there is comparatively little pain on defecation, and there is no spasm of the sphincters. Beyond slight staining of the linen, the patient has little discomfort. Blind internal fistula is the least common form, only about 10 per cent, of all cases being of this variety. There is usually a history of an abscess having burst into the rectum, and of pus and blood having escaped from the bowel. When the abscess is of the sub- mucous variety the fistula is compara- tively shcrt, and runs immediately under the mucous membrane, opening usually near the anal margin (Fig. 159a). When the fistula follows a pelvi-rectal abscess it is longer, more tortuous, and usually opens above the sphincters (Fig. 1596).

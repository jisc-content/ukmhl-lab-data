PYOSALPINX 557 present, having spread to the tube from a septic focus in the uterus following abortion, parturition, or some operation on the uterus. When the abscess is in close proximity to the rectum, the bacillus coli may be present. In abscesses of long standing, the organisms having died out, the pus is found to be sterile. In a proportion of cases as yet uncertain, the condition is tuberculous. As a result of the inflammatory process in the tube, the abdominal ostium becomes occluded, either by peritoneal adhesions gluing together the fimbriae, or by swelling of the mucous membrane blocking the lumen. The uterine opening ot the tube also becomes occluded, and the tube is thus converted into a closed cavity. As the tube distends with inflammatory Fig. 150.—Section of Pyosalpinx. (Dr. Haultain’s case.) products, it separates the two layers of the broad ligament and burrows between them, and at the same time it becomes elon- gated and tortuous, and its walls are thinned out (Fig. 150). The inflammatory process spreads to the peritoneal coat, and adhe- sions form binding the distended tube to the ovary, the uterus, the vaginal vault, the rectum, and sometimes to the intestine. The condition may be unilateral, but as a rule both tubes are affected, although to an unequal extent. The clinical features vary widely according to the stage of the disease and the nature of the infection. An acute stage is sometimes met with, particularly in cases due to puerperal infec- tion, and in those of gonorrhoeal origin. The onset is marked by a chill or rigor, the temperature rises to 102°-103° F., and the pulse is small, rapid, and compressible. The patient lies

In this way practically all the points of the brain which are wanted for operative purposes may be mapjied out. Thus the quadrilateral MDCA contains the Rolandic area. MA represents the precentral sulcus, and, if it be trisected in K and L, these points will correspond to the origins of the superior and inferior frontal sulci. The pentagon ABRPN corresponds to the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The apex of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe extends a little in front of N. The supra- marginal convolution lies in the triangle HBC. The angular gyrus is at B. A is over the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery, Fig. 5.—Chiene’s Method of Cerebral Localisation. and the bifurcation of the Sylvian fissure ; AC follows the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. The lateral sinus at its highest point touches the line PS at R. The fissure of Rolando may be marked out by taking a point half an inch behind the mid-point (M) (Fig. 4), and drawing a line downwards and forwards for a distance of about three and a half inches, at an angle of 67'5° with'the line GO. The angle of 67'5° can be readily determined by folding a square piece of paper on itself so as to make a triangle. The angle at the fold equals 45°. By folding the jrnper again upon itself in the same direction the right angle of the pajier is divided into four angles of 22'5° each. Three of these angles taken together make up the 67 '5°. If the straight edge of the paper be placed along the sagittal suture with the angle of folding over the upper end of the fissure of Rolando, the folded edge falls over the line of the fissure (Cliiene). Operations for Opening the Skull. The operation of opening the skull, by trephining or by raising a flap of bone, is called for in certain cases of fracture, of Jacksonian epilepsy, and in the treatment of cerebral

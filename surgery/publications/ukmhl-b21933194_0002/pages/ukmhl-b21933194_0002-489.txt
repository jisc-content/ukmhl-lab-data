OPERATIONS ON THE INTESTINE. 469 in vaginated into the lumen 1 by means of a purse-string suture. Both ends of the divided bowel ’ may be thus occluded and a lateral junction made between them. Entero-anastomosis, Lateral Anastom- osis or “ Short-Circuiting—By lateral anastomosis or “ short-circuiting ” of the t . intestine is understood the establishing of Implantation. a communication between the bowel above an irremovable obstruction and that below it. Such an anastomosis may be the only possible means of giving re- lief in a case of irre- movable growth, or it may only be a tem- porary measure to tide the patient over an obstruction, and pre- pare the way for re- section of the growth later. It is performed Fig. 123.—Short Cir- cuiting of Intestine- — Ileo - colostomy. «, tumour of caecum. on the same lines as gastro-enterostomy. In a case of malignant growth, portions of bowel well beyond the possible limits of the disease should be selected for anastomosis, and they should permit of ready apposition with- out tension. The loops of bowel selected are drawn out of the wound,clamped, and surrounded with gauze. A continuous sero - muscular suture is introduced, fixing the loops of bowel together along a line from two to three inches in length on the side of the intestine opposite the mesentery ; the bow7el is now opened on either side of this line of suture by an incision

TUMOURS OF CHEST WALL. 303 of the sternum, and when they erupt on the skin they give rise to characteristic syphilitic ulcers. While still subcutaneous they require to be differentiated from tuberculous disease and from sarcoma. Actinomycosis is sometimes met with on the chest wall. Painful affections in the line of the intercostal nerves—inter- costal neuralgia, pleurodynia 1vol. i. p. 385), and herpes zoster— are not uncommon. Fig. 82.—Large Lipoma of back in a woman, ret. 50. (Mr. F. M. Caird's case.) Tumours.—The skin of the chest wall is a common site of keloid, forming in the scars left by wounds or by acne spots. Fibromata, neuro-fibromata, and moles are also met with in the skin. Lipomata are common, particularly on the back, and sometimes attain a great size (Fig. 82). A ncevus or a lymph- angioma occurring in the subcutaneous tissue is liable to be mistaken for a cold abscess or for a hernia of the lung. The ribs and sternum may be the seat of simple osteomata or chondromata, but as a rule such tumours tend to assume the characters of sarcomata.

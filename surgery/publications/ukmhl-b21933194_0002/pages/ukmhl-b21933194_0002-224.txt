204 THE SALIVARY GLANDS. of these different elements varying in individual specimens, and it may include some portions that are adenomatous. A gelatinous substance forms in the intercellular spaces of the tumour, and may accumulate in sufficient quantity to give rise to cysts of various sizes. There is reason to believe that the tumours of the parotid previously described as adenoma, chon- droma, angioma, myxoma, and many of the cases of sarcoma, were really mixed tumours in which one or other of these tissues predominated. The tumour develops in the substance of the parotid, and in so doing becomes en- capsulated, and presses on the salivary tissue, thinning it out and caus- ing it to undergo atrophy. In the early stages the growth can be shelled out of the gland. Clinical Features.— The mixed tumour is usually first observed be- tween the ages of twenty and thirty. It is of slow growth and painless, and forms a rounded, nodular swelling, the consistence of which varies with its structure. The skin over the swelling is normal in appearance and is Fig. 65.—Mixed Tumour of the Parotid attached ^ to the of over twenty years’ duration. tumour (Fig. 65). Only in rare cases does para- lysis result from pressure on the facial nerve. Although usually benign, these tumours may, after lasting for years, take on malignant characters, growing rapidly, im- plicating adjacent lymphatic glands, and showing a marked tendency to recur after removal. The treatment consists in shelling the tumour out of the gland, care being taken to avoid injuring the facial nerve or Stenson’s duct by making the incision run parallel to them. If the tumour is removed early and completely recurrence is rare. Sarcomata and carcinomata of the parotid are rare. They

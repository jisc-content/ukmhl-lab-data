508 THE INTESTINES. Tlie clinical features are those common to all forms of gradual and incomplete obstruction of the intestine, and, if the affected coils are matted together, a sense of resistance or an ill-defined tumour is felt on palpation or on bi-manual examina- tion. It is usually possible to recognise the nature of the lesion from the history of the illness and the presence of other evidence of tuberculosis, but the diagnosis is sometimes only made after opening the abdomen. In our experience this condition is more commonly met with in children than in adults. The choice of operation lies between an entero-anasto- mosis and resection of the diseased segment of gut (Fig. 137). The tuberculous, ileo-ccecal tumour is a well-defined clinical type of abdominal tuberculosis. The dis- ease is often limited to the ileo-csecal seg- ment, although it may extend for a variable distance along the ascending colon or the lower ileum. The tumour results from a great increase in the thick- ness of the wall of the Fig. 137. — Portion of Small Intestine showing bowel and is SOme- Multiple Strictures following on Tuberculous , ■ ’ , , , ,, Ulcers.

The condition is most frequently met with between the ages of twenty and forty, but may occur much later in life, and also in children. A tumour in the right iliac fossa or flank may first attract attention ; more commonly there is a preliminary history of failing health, of griping pains, and alternate con- stipation and diarrhoea, and sometimes there is blood and mucus in the stools. If the lumen of the gut is narrowed, there are threatenings of obstruction, and, in emaciated subjects, visible peristalsis and distension of the lower coils of ileum may be recognised.

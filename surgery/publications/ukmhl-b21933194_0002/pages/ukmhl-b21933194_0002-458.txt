438 THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM. Lembert’s Suture.—In this suture, suggested by Lembert in 1826 (Fig. 113), the needle is introduced about a quarter of an inch from the edge of the wound, and passed through the serous, muscular, and part of the submucous coats, and, without enter- ing the lumen of the bowel, is made to emerge close to the edge of the wound on the same side. It is next introduced to the same depth close to the edge on the opposite side, and made to emerge about a quarter of an inch farther out. When this stitch is tightened, the edges are inverted and the peritoneal surfaces are brought into close contact. These sutures may be inter- rupted or continuous. a b Fig. 115.—Purse-String Suture—a, Suture introduced around stump of Appendix ; 6, Suture tied, burying stump. The Czerny-Lembert suture (Fig. 114) consists in introducing a continuous suture through all the coats to bring the margins of the wound together, and then burying this by a Lembert suture which approximates the serous surfaces.

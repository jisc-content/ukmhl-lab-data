583 ANO-RECTAL FISTULA. sphincters and other muscles, and the irregularity of the abscess cavity. The complete fistula is the form most frequently met with, about 70 per cent, of all cases being of this variety. It is usually due to an ischio-rectal or a pelvi-rectal abscess having burst both towards the bowel and v towards the skin. There are usually two or more external open- ings situated within an inch or an inch and a half of the anus. The internal opening, which is almost always single, is most com- monly found exactly opposite the space be- tween the external and internal sphincters (Fig. burrows upwards under Fig. 156.—Diagram of complete Fistulse. 156a). Sometimes, however, the pus the mucous membrane and opens at a higher level (Fig. 1566). The track of the fistula is irregular and tortuous, with one or more dilatations in its course. On rectal examination it is recognised by the induration of the tissues around it. It is not always easy to pass a probe from one opening to the other on account of the ir- regular diverticula in the track of the chan- nel. When the fistula follows a bilateral or “ horse-slioe ” abscess the channel may sur- round the rectum, and openings form on both sides — f horse - shoe fistula.” As a rule the burrowing is most marked towards the posterior aspect of the rectum (Fig. 157). There is always more or less pain and spasmodic contraction of the sphincters. The bowels are usually loose, and thin faeces may escape from the opening, soiling the linen. The patient is liable to become mentally depressed or even melancholic.

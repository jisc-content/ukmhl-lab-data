TRAUMATIC INSANITY. 39 'Traumatic insanity may follow injury to any part of the brain, and it may come on either immediately or after an interval. It may or may not be associated with epilepsy. Any form of insanity, except perhaps general paralysis of the insane, may occur, either as a direct result of the trauma, or from the resistance of the brain being lowered by the injury in a patient predisposed to insanity. Cases occurring within a few days of the injury usually recover within a month or two. The later the condition is in developing, the worse is the prognosis. Surgical treatment by trephining has not been conspicuously successful. After severe head injuries the patient’s whole mental attitude is sometimes changed, so that he becomes irritable, unstable, and incapacitated for brain work. In some cases self-control is lost, and alcoholic and drug habits are developed. Meningitis, sinus thrombosis, and cerebral abscess may follow upon any form of head injury attended with bacterial infection. The clinical features—save for the history of a traumatism— correspond so closely with those of the same conditions occurring apart from injury, that they are considered together (p. 52).

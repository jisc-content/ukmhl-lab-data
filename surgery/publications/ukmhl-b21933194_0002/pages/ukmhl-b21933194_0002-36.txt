In all intra-cranial operations every precaution must be taken to diminish shock, by keeping up the body temperature and by avoiding as far as possible injury to the cerebral tissue. The temperature of the operating-room should not be less than 75° F., and the brain when exposed should be frequently irrigated with saline solution at a temperature of about 115° F. As a further precaution against shock, in cases of cerebral tumour, Victor Horsley recommends that the operation should be performed in two stages : the first consisting in opening the skull; the second, undertaken about five days later, in opening the dura and dealing with the intra-cranial lesion. When possible, the head is shaved a day or two before the operation, the scalp thoroughly purified, and the general pre- paration of the patient carried out in the same way as for other major operations. Some surgeons give one-sixth to one- third of a grain of morphin hypodermically just before the operation to diminish haemorrhage by contracting the arterioles, and to dull the patient’s sensations so that a comparatively small Fig. 6.—To illustrate site of various operations on the skull.

74 DISEASES OF THE BRAIN AND MEMBRANES. gross lesion of the brain numerous surgical procedures have been suggested; for example, the making of a permanent opening in the skull to diminish the intra-cranial tension (Kocher); ligation of the carotid and vertebral arteries (Alexander); ligature of the longitudinal sinus at two points several inches apart (Delageniere); excision of the cervical sympathetic cord (Jonnesco); and excision of the cortical centres governing the groups of muscles first affected in the fits (Y. Horsley). From none of these operations, however, have the results been en- couraging. Hernia Cerebri.—This term is applied to a pro- trusion of brain substance through an acquired open- ing in the skull and dura mater. Such an opening may be the result of a com- pound fracture, a gunshot wound, or a surgical oper- ation. The protrusion is essentially due to increased intra-cranial tension, which increased tension may re- sult from the presence of a tumour within the cranium, or may be associated with septic infection of the brain and its membranes. Other things being equal, a hernia is more likely to occur through a small than through a large opening in the skull. When the extruded portion of brain matter is small, it usually pulsates, but as it increases in size and is pressed upon by the edges of the opening through which it escapes, the pulsation ceases, and the herniated portion may become strangu- lated and slough. In cases of compound fracture, and in other conditions associated with necrosis of bone, masses of redundant granulation tissue growing from the soft parts outside the skull may simulate a hernia cerebri. The treatment consists in removing, when possible, the cause of the increased intra-cranial tension. When this is of such a nature that it cannot be removed, steps must be taken to prevent Fig. 20.—Hernia Cerebri after operation for cerebral abscess. The patient recovered. (Mr. J. M.

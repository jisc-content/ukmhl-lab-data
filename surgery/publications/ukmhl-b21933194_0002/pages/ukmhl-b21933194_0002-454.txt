THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM. 434 while the pyloric portion carries out the active grinding and churning movements. When it is seen in its normal condition, in the course of an operation, for example, the stomach is relaxed and flaccid, and is flattened so that the two walls are approximated to one another. .When empty and con- tracted, it is almost cylindrical. Position of the Stomach.—When the stomach is in its normal flaccid condition, it lies obliquely, so that a plane projected through the two Fig. 112.—Tracing to illustrate relations of Normal Stomach to Parietes in the male. curvatures looks upwards, forwards, and to the right; and when it is distended this plane is nearly vertical. In the adult, the lowest portion of the stomach is the junction of the body with the pyloric portion ; in the infant, it is about the middle of the body. The level of the most dependent part of the greater curvature varies with the condition of the stomach, and is not the same in all persons. In the empty and contracted stomach, such as is met with in stricture of the gullet, the great curvature may be actually under cover of the liver ; in conditions of moderate distension it may reach down to the level of the umbilicus ; when the stomach is abnormally dilated, it may

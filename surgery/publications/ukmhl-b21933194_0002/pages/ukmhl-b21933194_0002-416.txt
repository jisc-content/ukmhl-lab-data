Definition—Constituent parts — Richter’s hernia — Littre’s hernia— Etiology of hernia—Clinical conditions : Reducible; Irreducible ; Obstructed or Incarcerated; Strangulated—Inguinal hernia: Anat- omy ; Varieties; Oblique ; Direct; Interstitial hernia; Inguinal hernia in children—Femoral hernia—Umbilical—Ventral—Lumbar —Obturator—Diaphragmatic—Hernia of individual viscera. The term hernia is applied to the protrusion of any of the abdominal contents from the cavity of the abdomen. When bowel or omentum is protruded, the term hernia is applied without qualification, but when other viscera are present, such terms as “ hernia of the bladder,” “ hernia of the stomach,” and so on, are employed. The popular name “ rupture ” is misleading, as the formation of a hernia is not attended with tearing of tissue. The common varieties of hernia are known as inguinal, femoral, and umbilical, from the regions with which they are respectively associated. Etiology of Hernia.—The chief predisposing factor favouring the development of hernia is an error or defect in development. Certain hernias, particularly in the inguinal and umbilical regions, are congenital, and are due to imperfect closure of the openings in the abdominal wall. The weakness of the abdominal wall at the umbilicus or at any point where its normal constituents have been replaced by scar tissue, also favours the formation of a hernia, and the structural arrangements at the inguinal and femoral canals act in the same direction. Males are more liable to hernia than females because of the frequency of errors of development in relation to the obliteration of the processus vaginalis, and of the weakness of the abdominal wall at the site of passage of the spermatic cord, and because of the more laborious nature of their occupations.

The Scrotum. Surgical Anatomy.—The skin of the scrotum is thin and pigmented, and contains numerous sebaceous glands. It is rendered contractile by the presence in its deeper layers of a considerable quantity of non-striped muscular tissue—the dartos muscle. The skin and dartos together foim a single sac, which is divided by a mesial septum or raphe into two com- partments, each of which contains one of the testes and the corresponding spermatic cord. Injuries.—All forms of wounds are met with in the scrotum. In lacerated wounds the tunica vaginalis may be opened and the testis prolapsed. In incised wounds, when primary union is aimed at, the stitches must be inserted with great care, as the dartos muscle tends to invert the edges. It is of great importance to arrest all bleeding and to provide for drainage. Contusions of the scrotum may be followed by extensive infiltration of the subcutaneous connective tissue with blood, giving rise to a dark purple or blackish discoloration, which may be confined to one side of the scrotum, or may involve both sides and extend to the perineum, penis, groin, and anterior abdominal wall. Frequently a localised hcematoma results and forms a tense,

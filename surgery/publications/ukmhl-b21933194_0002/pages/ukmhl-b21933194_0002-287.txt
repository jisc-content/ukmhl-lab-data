The oesophagoscope is also of great value, both for diagnostic purposes and as an aid in the removal of the impacted body. The impaction of foreign bodies may be followed by various complications ; for example, ulceration and perforation of the wall of the oesophagus, leading to septic cellulitis of the neck or mediastinum ; perforation of the air-passages, leading to septic pneumonia; injury of the thyroid gland, setting up acute sup- Fig. 76.—Radiogram of Safety-pin impacted in the Gullet and perforating the Larynx.

CEPHALOCELES. 67 tumour does not pulsate, but increases in size and tension when the child cries or coughs. It may be diminished in size or even made to disappear entirely by pressure, and so permit of the opening in the bone being felt. This manipulation, however, may be followed by slowing of the pulse, vomiting, loss of conscious- ness, or convulsions. Small meningoceles may remain stationary for a long time, or may even undergo spontaneous cure. Those of larger size usually progress till they eventually burst, and death results from the escape of the cerebro-spinal fluid or from septic menin- Fig. 18.â€”Enceplialocele in child aged 1A.

Encephaloceles are much commoner than meningoceles, and usually occur in the frontal region, where they form broad-based, elastic, and pulsatile tumours, which vary greatly in size. The hyclrencephalocele is usually met with in the occipital region, and is generally so large and associated with such great cerebral deformity as to be inconsistent with life. It does not as a rule pulsate. Cephaloceles have to be diagnosed from dermoid cysts, nsevi, cephal-hydrocele (p. 68), and cephal-hsematoma (p. 2). Their recognition is seldom attended with difficulty. If the margins

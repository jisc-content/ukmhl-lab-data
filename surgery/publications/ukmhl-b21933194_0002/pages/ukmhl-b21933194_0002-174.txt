Stomatitis—Roof of mouth : Abscess; Gumma ; Tuberculous disease ; Tumours—Elongation of uvula—Epithelioma of floor of mouth— Inflammation of fauces and tonsils—Hypertrophy of tonsils—Cal- culus— Syphilis and Tuberculosis— Tumours — Retro-pharyngeal abscess. Stomatitis.—The term stomatitis is applied to any inflammation of the buccal mucous membrane. The catarrhal form is often associated with the presence of carious teeth or a septic wound ; the mucous membrane is hypersemic and swollen, and exudes an excessive amount of viscid mucous secretion, and the epithelium desquamates in patches, leaving small superficial erosions or ulcers which are very sensitive. The aphthous form, met with in unhealthy, underfed children, is characterised by the occurrence of patches of fibrinous exudation into the superficial layers of the mucous membrane. The epithelium covering these patches is shed, leaving a series of whitish spots, surrounded by a red hyperaemic zone, which may become confluent and form small ulcers. The condition known as thrush closely resembles aphthous stomatitis. It is met with in infants during the period of teething, and is due to the o'idium albicans, a fungus met with in sour milk. The spots, which are most numerous on the lips, tongue, and throat, have the appearance of curdled milk. The treatment of these forms of stomatitis consists in improving the general condition of the patient, and in employing an anti- septic mouth-wash, such as peroxide of hydrogen, Condy’s fluid, chlorate of potash, or boro-glyceride. The superficial ulcers may be touched with silver nitrate or with a 1 per cent, solution of chromic acid. Ulcerative stomatitis is frequently met with in debilitated MOUTH.

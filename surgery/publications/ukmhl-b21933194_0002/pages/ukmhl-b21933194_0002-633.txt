The ureter lies on the psoas muscle, and is closely adherent to the parietal peritoneum overlying it. It descends almost vertically about an inch and a half from the mesial plane, and dips into the pelvis in front of the termination of the common iliac artery, two fingers’ breadths above a point where a line between the anterior superior iliac spines cuts a vertical line from the spine of the pubes. The renal blood-vessels enter at the liilum, the vein lying in front of the artery. The ureter lies Fig. 162.—Outline Diagram of Kidneys as viewed from tlie front. (After Stiles, Cunningham’s Text-Bool.) behind the vessels. The lymphatics pass from the lulum to the retro- peritoneal lumbar glands. The blood-vessels are distributed in the kidney substance in two main groups, an anterior and a posterior, and it has been shown that the cortex may be cut through to gain access to the pelvis with the minimum loss of blood if the incision is made slightly to the dorsal side of the convex border of the organ. The ureter is so well supplied with blood- vessels running in its wall that it may be lifted from its bed to a con- siderable extent without impairing its vitality. The Urine.—Various terms are employed in relation to the amount and character of the renal secretion : thus polyuria indicates an increase in the amount of urine, oliguria a diminution, and anuria a complete suppression or arrest of secretion. Hcematuria implies an admixture of VOL. II—39

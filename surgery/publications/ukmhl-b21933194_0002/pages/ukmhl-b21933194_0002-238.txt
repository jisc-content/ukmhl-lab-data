218 THE EAR, requirements of the case, constitute a routine method. Packing the meatus with antiseptic gauze after washing out may be practised. Suppuration in the Mastoid Antrum and Cells, or Acute Suppurative Mastoiditis.—Acute suppuration may occur in the mastoid antrum in the course of an attack of acute otitis media, or as a result of interference with drainage in chronic suppura- tion of the antrum or middle ear. As the outer wall of the mastoid is liable to be perforated by cario-necrosis, the pus may find its way externally and form an abscess over the mastoid process behind the ear. In some cases the pus escapes into the external auditory meatus by perforating its posterior wall; in others a sinus forms on the inner side of the apex of the mastoid and the pus bur- rows in the digastric fossa under the sterno-mastoid— Bezold’s mastoiditis. If the posterior wall or roof of the antrum is destroyed, intra- cranial complications are liable to ensue. The clinical features are pain behind the ear, tender- ness on pressure or percus- sion over the mastoid. oedema of temporal region and face, dis- placing the auricle and closing the eye. Fig. 66.—Acute Suppurative Mastoiditis, There is usually redness with sub-periosteal abscess and great an(J oedematous swelling of the skin, and, when pus forms under the periosteum, the oedema may be so great as to displace the auricle downwards and forwards (Fig. 66). The deeper part of the posterior osseous wall of the meatus may be swollen so that it conceals the upper and back part of the membrane. Treatment.—When arising in connection with acute otitis, the application of several leeches behind the ear, free incision of the membrane, and syringing with hot boracic lotion may be sufficient. As a rule, however, it is necessary to expose the interior of the antrum by opening through the mastoid cells —Schwartze’s operation. In operating for the relief of symptoms in acute cases it is

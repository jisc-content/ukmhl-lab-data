THE URINARY BLADDER. 658 escapes in jets. In the male the tumour is continuous below with a rudimentary penis, the urethra being represented by an open gutter on the dorsum—epispadias. The malformation entails considerable suffering, the urine dribbles away, so that the clothing is constantly wet, and the skin becomes red and excoriated. Decomposition of the urine and inflammation of the exposed mucous surface of the bladder are liable to occur, and the infection may ascend to the kidneys and prove dangerous to life. Various plastic operations have been performed with the object of forming a new anterior wall to the bladder, but because Fig. 179.—Extroversion of the Bladder in a Female Child. of the absence of any sphincter muscle the incontinence is not benefited, and if decomposition of the urine with deposition of phosphates take place, the newly-formed bladder is liable to become the seat of stone. To overcome the incontinence the ureters may be transplanted into the sigmoid flexure or into the rectum. To diminish the risk of ascending infection from the bowel, Maydl of Vienna transplanted the segment of bladder wall containing the ureteral orifices intact, thus preserving the valvular character of these openings. An extra-peritoneal opera- tion has been introduced by Peters of Toronto, the ureters being inserted into the rectum. After either of these procedures the patient is able to retain the urine in the rectum for several hours, and to void it at will. The morning urine is mixed with faeces,

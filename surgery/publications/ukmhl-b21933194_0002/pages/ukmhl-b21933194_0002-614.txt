590 THE RECTUM AND ANUS. In addition to the protrusion of the pile mass from the anus, the most important symptoms are haemorrhage, pain, and dis- charge of mucus. In piles of the first degree the bleeding is usually slight, in some cases amounting only to a streaking of the motion, or to the loss of a few drops of blood at each act of defecation. It only occurs while the bowels are moving, and is most marked when the motions are hard and the bowels constipated. If the Fig. 160.â€”Protruded Internal Piles, with oedema of skin round anus. bowels are kept regular and the motions soft, there may be no bleeding. It is in piles of the second degree that bleeding becomes a prominent and serious symptom. As a rule the blood escapes from the piles after they have been protruded, and continues to flow as long as they remain down, the bleeding being due to interference with the venous return caused by constriction of the neck of the piles by the spasmodically contracted external sphincter. In such cases the blood is venous in character, and escapes from the surface of the pile mass in a steady ooze, and the bleeding stops whenever the piles are returned within the bowel.

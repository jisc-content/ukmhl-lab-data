763 PHIMOSIS. THE PENIS. Surgical Anatomy. — The penis is composed of the two corpora cavernosa, which lie towards the dorsum, and the corpus spongiosum, which occupies the groove on the ventral aspect ot the corpora cavernosa, and is traversed by the urethra. These different elements are enclosed by fibrous sheaths. The conical end of the penis- the expanded anterior end of the corpus spongiosum — is known as the glans, and the redundant fold of skin which covers it as the prepuce. The lymphatics of the external genitals drain chiefly into the group of inguinal glands which run parallel with Poupart’s ligament. Malformations—Phimosis.—The most common malforma- tion of the penis is phimosis, a condition in which the prepuce, owing to the small size of its orifice, cannot be retracted over the glans. Phimosis may be congenital or acquired. In congenital phimosis, the prepuce, in addition to having an Sheath of corpora cavernosa Urethra Dorsal arteries Corpus cavernosum Corpus spongiosum Fig. 201.—Transverse Section of Penis. unduly small orifice, is usually unnaturally long and pointed, and the slight adhesions which, at birth, normally exist between the prepuce and the glans persist to a greater or less extent. Sometimes the prepuce is shorter than normal and is tightly stretched over the glans, to which it is intimately adherent. In the sulcus round the corona there is an accumulation of inspissated smegma which forms a white putty-like mass, or may be moulded into small rounded concretions. During childhood the main trouble caused by phimosis is interference with micturition. When the prepuce is long and not adherent, and its orifice is smaller than the urinary meatus, the urine collects in the preputial pouch and distends it during micturition. Dilatation of the urethra and bladder, and even of the ureters and renal pelvis, leading to hydronephrosis, has been observed to result from the backward pressure in extreme cases.

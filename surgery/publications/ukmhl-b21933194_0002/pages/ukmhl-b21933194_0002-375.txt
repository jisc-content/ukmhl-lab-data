Peritonitis. The term peritonitis is applied to any inflammation of the peritoneum, and the changes observed in the membrane are to be regarded as representing the reaction of its tissue elements to an irritant. Non-infective Peritonitis.—When the irritation is produced by attenuated organisms which are readily overcome by the tissues, the changes in the peritoneum are essentially reparative. Such changes constitute what has been termed “aseptic or reparative peritonitis.” They consist in the exudation of serum and of fibrinous lymph ; these are either reabsorbed or result in the formation of adhesions between opposing surfaces of peri- toneum. When blood is extravasated into the peritoneal cavity, as in the rupture of an extra-uterine pregnancy or of such an organ as the liver, it has been found by Dudgeon and Sargent that a white staphylococcus can be cultivated from the clot, and yet the blood may be entirely reabsorbed, or there may be excited a certain degree of irritation of the peritoneum which results in the encapsulation of the blood, and the forma- tion of a blood-cyst; infective changes terminating in sup- puration are quite the exception. It is believed by Dudgeon and Sargent that the white staphylococcus inhibits the action of

Ovarian Tumours.—Of the many varieties of tumour met with in relation to the ovary and parovarium, it is only necessary here to refer to the cystic forms, of which the most important are multilocular cyst-adenomata, dermoid and parovarian cysts, and papillary tumours. Solid tumours, such as fibromata, myo- mata, sarcomata, and carcinomata, are comparatively rare; they are frequently associated with free peritoneal fluid, and this is as common with the benign as with the malignant varieties. The multilocular cyst-adenoma may be taken as the classi- cal form of ovarian cyst. It is due to a proliferation of the glandular elements of the ovary; the glands become dis- tended with secretion and form numerous cysts of different sizes. The condition is usually unilateral, but it may affect both ovaries. In its most common form the tumour is made up of one large cyst, with numerous smaller cysts in relation to it. On section the mass of small cysts presents a honeycomb appear- ance, delicate fibrous partitions intervening between the different cavities. These partitions tend to give way, so that the cysts come to communicate with one another, and thus the small cysts become absorbed in the larger one. The cysts contain a tinted fluid, varying in consistence, and composed chiefly of the secretion of the cylindrical epithelium lining the cavities. As a result of haemorrhage into the cyst the fluid is sometimes reddish-brown or porter-coloured. The tumour, which varies in size from an orange to a mass displacing the viscera and filling the abdomen, is rounded or oval in outline, with irregular projections on its surface due to 1 This chapter has been revised by Dr. F.

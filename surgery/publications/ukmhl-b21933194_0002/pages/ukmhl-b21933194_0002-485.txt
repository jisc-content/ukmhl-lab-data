Surgical Anatomy.—When the abdominal walls are reflected, and the great omentum displaced upwards, the small intestine is seen to be arranged in a series of coils or loops, the jejunal coils occupying the upper and left portion of the abdominal cavity, while the ileum lies below and to the right. Individual coils, however, are so liable to vary in position that the only certain means of identifying a particular part of the bowel is by tracing the intestine, either from the duodeno-jejunal junction above, or from the cscum below. There is an insensible transi- tion from jejunum to ileum, but if one of the upper coils of the jejunum is compared with one of the lower coils of ileum, the former is found to be larger in calibre and darker in colour, and its walls are thicker, because of the greater size and number of the valvulfe conniventes. In the lower part of the ileum the valvulse conniventes are small and widely separated, and the Peyer’s patches large and numerous. The duodenum is not visible from the front, being covered by the liver above and by the transverse colon below. Attention may be directed to some common variations in the position of certain parts of the large intestine. The transverse colon, for example, may hang down for a variable distance in front of the small intestine, sometimes as a V-shaped loop with its apex reaching as low as the symphysis pubis. The sigmoid flexure—or, as

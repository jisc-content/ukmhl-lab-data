FRACTURES OF THE VAULT. 45 localised indentation of the bone, to complete smashing of the whole skull into fragments. Diagnosis.—When compound, the nature of these fractures is readily recognised on exploring the wound, but their extent is not always easy to determine. It is not uncommon for extensive fissures to pass into the base. A hsematoma of the scalp may readily be mistaken for a depressed fracture. The condensation of the tissues round the seat of impact, and the soft coagulum in the centre closely simulate a depression in the bone; but if firm pressure is made with the finger, the irregular edge of the bone can be recognised, Fig. 12. — Pond Fracture of Left Frontal Bone, produced during delivery. (Fronl a photograph lent by Mr. J. H. Nicoll.) and the dejjressed portion is felt to be on a lower level. On the other hand, sometimes a depression in the bone is obscured by an overlying haimatoma, and unless great care is taken the fracture may be overlooked. Treatment.—All are agreed that compound depressed and com- minuted fractures—whether associated with cerebral symptoms or not—should be operated on, to enable the wound to be purified, and the normal outline of the skull to be restored by elevating or removing depressed or separated fragments. Except in young children, in whom considerable degrees of depression are frequently righted by nature, most surgeons recommend operative

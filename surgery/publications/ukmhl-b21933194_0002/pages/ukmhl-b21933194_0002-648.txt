624 THE KIDNEY AND URETER. hydronephrosis. These changes at first consist in loss of elasti- city in the wall of the pelvis and unequal dilatation of its cavity, the segment below the ureteral opening distending more than that above, and the orifice of the ureter no longer being at the most dependent part of the pelvis (Fig. 166). Further, as a result of the rotation of the kidney that accompanies its descent, the pelvis moves forward and the ureter comes to lie along the posterior wall of the sac, and congestive changes occur, which result in the formation of adhesions between the pelvis and ureter, fixing the quantities of diuretic beverages. When all outflow from the pelvis is arrested, this is described as the conversion of an “open” that even in a closed hydronephrosis the lumen of the ureter is not necessarily obliterated; a ureteral catheter may be passed from the bladder upwards into the pelvis. Obstacles in the course of the ureter are less common causes of hydronephrosis; they include such conditions as congenital anomalies in the course of the ureter, impacted calculus, villous growth, stricture, injuries to the ureter in gynecological opera- tions, compression of the ureter by pelvic tumours, or traction upon and kinking of the ureter by cicatricial tissue formed around the uterus. latter in its bent position, and embedding it in the posterior wall of the dilated pelvis. The ureteral opening becomes more and more oblique and slit-like, while the layers of tissue intervening between the cavity of the pelvis and the lumen of the ureter become fused and thinned out until they form a spur or valve which may entirely close the ureteral opening (Fig. 167). Recurrent attacks of in- termittent hydronephrosis may occur, for example, from swelling of the mucous U membrane of the pelvis, such as may attend the conges- tion of menstruation, sexual after the ingestion of large into a “ closed hydronephrosis.” It must be clearly understood

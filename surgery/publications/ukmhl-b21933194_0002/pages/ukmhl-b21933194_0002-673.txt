649 TUMOURS AND CYSTS. usually at one of the poles or in the perirenal cellular tissue, and become closely applied to the capsule of the organ. As the cyst enlarges it projects from the surface, and may attain enormous dimen- sions (Fig. 175). The cyst causes no symptoms, and is not recognised un- less it is large enough to form a palpable tumour ; it is then liable to be mistaken for a hydro- nephrosis, or, if at the lower pole, for an ovarian tumour. The treatment is to remove the cyst by Fig. 175.—Solitary Cyst at Upper Pole of Left dissection, preserving the Kidney, from a woman, set. 29. kidney. Polycystic Kidney—Cystic Degeneration of the Kidney. —This is a comparatively rare condition, in which the kidney becomes permeated with a vast num- ber of cysts which greatly add to the size of the organ, and which lead to the almost complete disappearance of the secreting tissue (Fig. 176). The cysts vary in size and may attain the dimensions of grapes or walnuts, and their contents are clear and straw- coloured or dark yellow, purplish or deeply blood-stained. The cysts often communicate with one another, but they do not communicate with the pelvis or calyces. Both kidneys are commonly affected, although the dis- ease is usually more advanced on one side; in a considerable proportion of cases, the liver, and less frequently the spleen, is also the seat of multiple cysts. As in other chronic affections of the kidney, there may be hyper- trophy of the left ventricle of the Pig. 176.—Polycystic Kidney from a woman, ret. 40, in whom the other kidney also was affected. heart and general arterio-sclerosis.

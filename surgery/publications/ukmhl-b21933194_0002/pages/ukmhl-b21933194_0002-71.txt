FRACTURES OF THE BASE. 51 are also liable to occur in fractures rendered compound by opening into the nose, pharynx, or ear, but they are less common than might be expected. Treatment.â€”The general treatment includes that for all head injuries. In a number of cases attended with symptoms of compression benefit has followed trephining for the relief of intra-cranial tension due to haemorrhage. The withdrawal of 30 or 40 cc. of cerebro-spinal fluid by lumbar puncture has also proved beneficial in the same way. Local treatment is directed towards preventing septic infection from the mucous surfaces implicated. This is exceedingly diffi- cult in fractures opening into the pharynx and nose. Owing to the general condition of the patient it is usually impossible to employ nasal douching or mouth washes, but spraying of the cavities with peroxide of hydrogen or other antiseptics may be employed with benefit. In fractures of the middle fossa the ear should be washed out, care being taken not to force the fluid through the fracture. The meatus is then plugged with iodoform gauze or antiseptic wool, retained in position by adhesive plaster or a bandage. When there is a persistent escape of blood or cerebro-spinal fluid, the dressing requires to be changed very frequently. In compound fractures of the anterior fossa due to perfora- tion through the orbit, the frontal bone should be trephined, to admit of the removal of loose fragments of bone or of any foreign body which may have entered the skull, and to provide for drainage.

569 CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS. thin fibrous membrane, which stretches from the centre of the perineum to the region of the coccyx. The meconium bulges this membrane, and forms a dark bluish swelling in the perineum which becomes tense when the infant cries or strains. In some cases the membrane is incomplete, and meconium escapes at its edges. As a rale the canal is normally developed in other respects. Occasionally the anal canal is absent (Fig. 151), the position of the orifice being indicated merely by a slight pigmentation and corrugation of the integument. More frequently the canal is repre- sented by a depression which admits the tip of the little Fig- 152-" finger, but does not communi- cate with the rectum (Fig. 153). In some cases the cavities are only separated by a thin septum—the remains of the cloacal membrane; in others, a bridge of fibrous tissue, varying in thickness, inter- venes between them. Clinical Features.—These abnormalities may escape notice until attention is drawn to the fact that the infant’s bowels have not moved. An examination of the perineum then reveals the deformity. If nothing is done to permit the meconium to escape, the infant becomes restless and irritable, and appears to suffer • from abdominal pain. There is continuous straining and frequent vomiting, and the abdomen becomes distended, tense, and tender. If unrelieved, symptoms of peritonitis ensue, and the condition proves fatal. -Complete absence of Rectum, the Colon ending in a large Dilatation, and the Anus being normally de- veloped.

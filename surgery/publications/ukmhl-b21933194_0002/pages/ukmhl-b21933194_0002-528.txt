506 THE INTESTINES. Intractable Colitis.—Apart from dysentery there are other forms of inflammation and ulceration which may affect the colon. The leading symptoms are diarrhoea, griping pains, and loss of flesh. The diarrhoea usually alternates with constipa- tion ; it is often offensive and associated with want of control of the sphincters. The motions may contain mucus, pus, and sometimes blood, and in a certain group of cases they contain mucous or membranous casts of the bowel. The membranous form is chiefly met with in neurotic women, and is at- tended with great pain on defecation. In cases which resist medical treatment great benefit usually follows irrigation carried out on the same lines as in chronic dysentery. Chronic Inflammatory Thickening of the Colon and Rectum.—Under this heading there falls to be described a rare condition which has hitherto been mis- taken for malignant disease. The sigmoid loop of the pelvic colon is the part of the bowel most frequently affected, hence the term sig- moiditis sometimes applied to the disease; it is also met with in the rectum, and in a case observed by our- selves both sigmoid and rectum were involved. On examining the sigmoid colon, it gives the impression of having been converted into a solid, more or less rigid cylinder; the investing peritoneum is thickened, rough, granular, and opaque, and the lumen is narrowed, usually to about one-third of the normal. On section of the wall of the bowel, the submucous coat is found to be the seat of an extensive formation of fibrous tissue, which by its contraction causes the mucous membrane to project into the lumen in the form of polypoidal or cauliflower-like elevations, an appearance which has some- times led to the condition being mistaken for multiple adenomata Fio. 136.—Chronic Inflammatory thicken- ing of Sigmoid, from a woman, set. 22.

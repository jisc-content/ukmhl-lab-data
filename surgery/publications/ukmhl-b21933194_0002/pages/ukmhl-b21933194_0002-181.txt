THE TONSILS. 161 Calculi composed of phosphate or carbonate of lime are sometimes formed in the crypts of enlarged tonsils. As a rule they are not bigger than a pea, but they may be much larger. They cause a sharp stabbing pain on swallowing, and sometimes a persistent hacking cough. They are easily shelled out through a small incision into the tonsil. Syphilis.—The fauces and tonsils are occasionally the seat of a hard chancre, and the condition may simulate malignant disease. The submaxillary glands, however, are early and rapidly enlarged. In the early stages of the secondary period, superficial ulcers and mucous patches are frequently met with. In the later stages, severe phagedamic ul- ceration sometimes oc- curs, especially in alcoholic subjects, and may rapidly eat through the soft palate, leading to marked deformity from contraction when cicatrisation takes place. In the tertiary stage, a diffuse gum- matous infiltration oc- curs, and is liable to Fig. 54. — Cicatricial Stenosis of communication be followed by ulcera- between pharynx and naso-pharynx, the result tion, which spreads to of syphilis. the pharyngeal wall (From a drawing lent by Dr. Logan Turner.) and soft palate, and, by causing cicatricial contraction and adhesions, may lead to narrowing or even complete occlusion of the communication between the pharynx and the naso-pharynx (Fig. 54). Tuberculous lesions of the fauces and tonsils are almost in- variably secondary to tubercle of the larynx or lungs, or to lupus of the face or naso-pharynx. They are attended with more pain than syphilitic lesions; are less prone to spread to the palate and cause perforation; but, when cicatrisation takes place, they are equally liable to produce contraction and deformity.

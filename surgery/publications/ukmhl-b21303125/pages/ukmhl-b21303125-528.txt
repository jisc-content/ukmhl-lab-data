502 CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE PERIOSTEUM, BONE, ETC. same way I once found the lower half of the tibia affected Avith osteo- malacia, in caries of the ankle. There was apparently the same tiling in a child that had the head of one femur removed for caries of the hip-joint. I assisted in this operation ; as I was on the point of lift- ing the thigh and rotating it outward to aid the operator, the thigli broke through the middle, right iu my hands ; a plaster-bandage was applied, and the fracture recovered; the child was completcl}' restored. In other cases, however, after fractures of bones with osteomalacia, in the so-called fragilitas ossium, pseudarthroses are ajjt to remain. I will also mention hypertropliy and atrophy of bone, which, how- CA^er, have more anatomical than clinical interest. Anatomically we may call any bone hypertrophic Avhich is enlarged in length or thickness. There are A'ery feAv cases Avhere single holloAv bones, as one femur or one tibia, are excessAe in length, and gAe rise to inequality of the extremities; for this excessive groAvth I ac- cept the name “ hypertrophy of bone,” or, better, “ giant-groAA’th ” (“ rieseiiAAmchs ”) ; still, to give this term to every thickening or scle- rosis Avould be of no practical value, although anatomically correct, because these conditions of the bone may depend on very different morbid processes, partly active, partly completed. Even more indefi- nite is tlie term atrophy of the bone; occasionally, a carious, osteo- malacial, or a half-destroyed bone, etc., is thus designated. This is of no practical value; Ave do not mean to deny that there may be atrophy of the bone Avithout a true morbid process. Senile atrophy, as of alveolar process of the jaAV, is a striking example of tins. Here the term atrophy of bone may be retained; in most other cases it Avould be better to name the process that has induced the atro])hy.

AUTHORâ€™S PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION. Vienna, Novemher, 1872. The steady advance of science, and tRe progress tliat we our selves make as long as we have the inclination and strength to swim with the stream, become most apparent when we are from time to time obliged to go over our old work. On a similar occasion I have already expressed this thought, but do not hesi- tate to repeat it here; for this perception of progress is a great support to us in the many dark hours when, with the greatest zeal to servo our fellow-men, we feel oppressed by the impotence of our knowledge and ability. I have again done my best to raise this book to the present level of our knowledge, and have untiringly striven to improve its form and contents; the section on Deformities has been en- tirely rewritten, old woodcuts have been replaced by better ones, and some new ones have been added; prescriptions have been given in grammes. May this enlarged edition also be well received, and arouse in the student a love of surgery! Til. BILLROTH.

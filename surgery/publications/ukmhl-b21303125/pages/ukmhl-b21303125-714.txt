C88 TUMORS. Subsequent!}', changes take place in these epithelial tubes; groupr of cells unite and form globules, which gradually grow by the deposit of new cells of the form of flat epithelium, and thus form the cabbage- like, compound epidermis-globules (globules 6pidermiques, cancroid globules, epithelial pearls), which so much excited the astonishment of the first person that examined them. It is most iDi'obable that these globules are developed from a num- ber of conglomerated cells, increasing by division, and the peripheral layers of cells being flattened by pressure against the parts around, which are not very distensible ; hence the larger these pearls become the more they project from tlie cell-cylinders, and hence they often appear at the terminal points of the glandular acini. Among the cells in the pearls, as in the epithelial parts of these tumors else- where, we often meet cells with many nuclei; also large cell-bodies, which have enclosed daughter and grandchild-cells. In some of these carcinomata stachel and riff cells have been found in great numbers, as in the boundary layers between the mucous and horny layers of the epidermis. If the epithelial masses have grown deep into the tissue, and if we make a section in these deeper layers of a hardened tumor of this variety, we find about the folio-wing picture, in which the alveoli, filled with epithelium, may readily be distinguished from the connective tissue which has become &veolate : Fra. 155.

198 SIMPLE FRACTURE OF BONES. connective-tissue union, 2^sei(clarthrosis (from tpevdrjg, false ; api^pwa/c, joint), a false joint; we shall hereafter describe these exceptional cases. Under normal circumstances the neoplasia now ossifies, as you already know. This ossification may either occur directly or after the inflamma- tory neoplasia has been transformed to cartilage. You know that both of these modes are seen in normal growth of the bone ; direct ossifica- tion of young cell-formation, for instance, in the periosteum of the growing bone, or formation of cartilage with subsequent ossification, as at first in the entire skeleton and in growth of the bones length- wise. Callus from fractures varies greatly in this res])ect in men and animals. In rabbits the callus is always changed to cartilage before ossification, as it also is in children. In old dogs the callus usually ossifies directly, as in the human adult; we are far from knowing the causes of these differences. To obtain a histological representation of these processes, let us return to our former diagram (Fig. 49) ; now imagine that the cells, lying in the spaces caused by reabsorption in the Haversian canals and surface of the bone, soon ossify and first fill these spaces (Fig. 50), then collect on the surface and in the medulla, Fig. 50. l)in"T.im of ossification of inllammiUory nenplastn on tho surface of the bone and In (ho navcp- ^iuii cunulB.

Periostitis -and ostitis, which lead chiefly or exclusively to the formalion of new bone, we call osteoplastic; in the present case the callus is the result of this.

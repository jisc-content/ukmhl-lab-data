5GG CONGENITAL DEFORMITIES OF THE JOINTS, ETC. V. DEFORMITIES CAUSED BY CICATRICES. VTe have already spoken frequently of the contraction of cica- trices , it results from the inflammatory new formation in the wound gradually giving off water, as the original gelatinous formation by degrees atrophies to dry connective tissue, and contracts like any body that IS drying up. The larger the surface of the cicatrix, the stronger Fig. 110. Fig. 111. Cicatricial contractions after bums. will be the contraction in all directions ; all wounds with extensive loss of skin Avill be followed by extensive cicatricial contraction, and, as this is generally greatest after burns, cicatrices from this cause are usually the ones that contract most. Of course it deiiends greatly on the position of the cicatrix whether it shall jiroduce injurious results, deformities or distortions. Cicatrices on the flexor side of the joint, when they extend far longitudinally, may prevent full extension of the limb. Extensive cicatrices in the neck induce distortion iuid fixation of the head to the injured side; those on the cheek may dis- tort the mouth or lowmr eyelid ; on the back of the hand or foot, or about the finger-joints, they may render the finger immovable, or ]iar- tially so. But cicatrices of the deeper parts, as of the muscles and tendons,

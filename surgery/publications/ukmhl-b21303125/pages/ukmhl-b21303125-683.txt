657 SARCOMATA. large number belong to these giant-celled sarcomata; their location on the gums is generally only apparent; they usually spring from cavities in the teeth, and have started from carious roots of teeth. Some also call epithelial cancer epulis; it is well either not to use such terms or to restrict them by certain adjectives; as sarcomatous, fibrous, carcinomatous epulis, etc. Peripheral osteosarcomata or peri- osteal sarcomata (osteoid-chondro- mata of Virchow) are quite ma- lignant; they either have granula- tion structure with osteoid tissue as in osteophites, and are partly ossified; or they are very large- celled myxosarcomata, also part- ly ossified. The rajoidity of the course varies greatly; sarcomata of the lungs have been observed after them. Spindle-celled sarcomata are found especially often in muscles, fascim, and cutis; they are locally very infectious, and often return after extirpation. Myxosarcomata come in the cutis and subcutaneous cellular tissue, and with the naked Compound cystoma of the thigh, after Peaw. eye are often difficult to distin- guish from oedematous soft fibromata. The nerves also aix relatively often the seat of multiple sarcoma. The more rapidly the primary tumors have grown, and the more “ medullary ” their appearance, the more dangerous they are. I find that all ages, except perhaps child- hood, are equally disposed to these tumors. WTien sarcoma develops in a gland it almost always contains glan- dular elements, whicfii m:iy be greatly changed in form, and some of which may be newly formed. Hence, pure adenomata (which are very rare) may be dillicult to distinguish from sarcomata that have de- veloiied in glands (adeno-sarcomata). Glands are by no means equallv disposed to the development of sarcoma; we shall briefly state the localities where they are most frequently found. The female mamma, more than any other gland, is subject to these tumors. Sarcomata of the mamma are roundish, lobular, nodulated

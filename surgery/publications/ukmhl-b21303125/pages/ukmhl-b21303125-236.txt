CHAPTER VI. OPEN FRACTURES AND SUPPURATION OF RONE. Difference between Subcutaneous and Open Fractures in regard to Prognosis.—Vari- eties of Cases.—Indications for Primary Amputation.—Secondary Amputation.— Course of the Cure.—Suppuration of Bone.—Necrosis of the Eu^ of Fragments. We shall now pass to comjDlicated or open fractures. When we speak simply of complicated fractures., we usually mean only those accompanied by wounds of the skin. Strictly speak- ing, tliis is not exact, because there are other comiahcations, some of them much more important than wounds of the skin. If the skull be fractured, and part of the brain-substance crushed, or some ribs broken and the lung wounded, these are also complicated fractures, even though the skin should remain uninjured. But, since in these cases the comjalications themselves are more important for the organism than the fracture is, we usually teiTn such cases contusion of the brain, or injury of the lung, with fracture of the skull or ribs. But we shall not here enter on the subject of injuries of internal organs by frag- ments of bone, because very complicated states of disease are occa- sionally induced in this waj’^, whose analysis you would not now un- derstand. For the present let us limit ourselves to fractures of the extremities, accompanied by wounds of the skin, which we shall call open fractures, and which will give us trouble enough in their course and treatment. In speaking of the course of simple contusions without wounds, and of contused wounds, I have already shown you how readily reab- sorj^jtion of extravasated blood and the healing of contused jjarts go on, as long as the process is subcutaneous, but how much the condi- tions change if the skin also be destroyed. The chief dangers in such cases are, as you may remember, decomposition in the wound, exten- sive necrosis of crushed or dead parts, progressive suppuration, and accompanying protracted, exhausting fever, while we have scjircclv

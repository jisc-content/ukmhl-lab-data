489 DETACHMENT OF THE SEQUESTRUM. time we must remark that in necrosis of these bones the new forma- tion is much less, often entirely wanting, because the inflammation here is particularly of constitutional origin, and hence occasionally de\dates from the normal course; as a rule, the inflammatory neo- plasia in necrosis of the spongy bones soon assumes the ulcerative character, and then the formation of new bone is but slight; more- over, acute, non-traumatic periostitis is something very rare in spongy bones. Extensive necrosis may even occur after originally pure ossifying periostitis and ostitis, in case the newly-formed ossific deposit is re- absorbed, suppurates and decomposes at the point of its attachment to the diseased bone; this gradually affects the nutrition of the bone; it often continues to live for a long time in the medullary cavity, or rather leads a half existence between living and dying; this variety of periostitis and necrosis occurs especially in the maxillarj^ bones after chronic poisoning bj phosiohorous fumes, a disease peculiar to workers in match-factories. I cannot enter more minutely into this phosphorous periostitis and necrosis, which has many noteworthy peculiarities, because it would be necessary to load you "with too Pig. 90. 1.

CHAPTER IX. BUBNSAj^D FROST-BITES. LECTURE XX. 1 Burus: Grade, Extent, Treatment.—Sunstroke.—Stroke of Liglitmng.—2. Frost- bites : Grade.—General Freezing, Treatment.—Cliilblaius. The symptoms due to burns and frost-bites are quite similar, but are sufficiently distinct to be regarded separately; we shall first treat of BUBNS. These are caused by the flames, when, for instance, the clothes burn, but more frequently by hot fluids, as when children pull vessels of hot water, coffee, soup, etc., off a table on to themselves. And, unfor- tunately, in factories, burns from hot metals, such as molten lead, iron, etc., are not rare, and in every-day life slighter burns from matches, sealing-wax, etc., often occur, as you have all doubtless seen. Besides the above, concentrated acids and caustic alkalies not unfrequently cause burns of various degrees, analogous to those from hot bodies. In burns the intensity and extent of the injury are to be regarded; we shall hereafter study the latter. The intensiti/ of the burn de- pends essentially on the grade of the heat and the duration of its action ; according to the result of this action, burns have been divided into three grades. These pass into one another, but from the acccom- panying symptoms may be distinguished without difficult}'; the only ob- ject of this is to render explanation easier. AVe assume three grades. First deffree (hyperaemia): The skin is much reddened, very painful, and slightly swollen. These symjitoms are due to dilatation of the capillaries, and slight exudation of scrum in the tissue of the cutis. There is a mild grade of inflammation, in which there is an increase of cells in the rete Mal[)ighii alone, which is followed, in many cases at least, by detachment of the epidermis.

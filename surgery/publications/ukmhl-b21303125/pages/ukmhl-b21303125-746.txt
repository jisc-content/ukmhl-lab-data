Gentlemen ; We have often had occasion to speak of amputa- tions and resections ; so, before closing these lectures, I -will explain to you these important operations, by which we remove limbs or portions of limbs which are so diseased that we cannot restore them to health. These operations, which are often so beneficial, even to saving life, are sometimes regarded as a testimonium x>aupertatis of surgery ; for cutting off diseased parts is not a genuine cure, if by cure we mean by our skill to restore to its normal state a part of the body which has been changed by disease. Ilowever, if you take this high standard for every thing in our art, the bounds of medical science will become very limited. In the same way, you could say a cataract is not curable ; for the cloudy lens is not again made clear, but is removed. Many of the most brilliant cures made by derma- tologists, where they have used caustics, must be regarded as proofs of the impotence of our art; and the same is true of a case where you prevent a man from suffocating by removing a tumor from the larynx. In the strict sense of the word, the most brilliant “cures” are made in such diseases as syphilis ; by antisyphilitic internal treatment, we often cause extensive and old morbid products to dis- appear in a few weeks, as if by magic. But such undoubted cures are rare in other diseases; we often have to content ourselves with destroying the diseased part, and thus preventing not only the

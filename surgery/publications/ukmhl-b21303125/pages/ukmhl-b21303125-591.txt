565 SHORTENING OF THE FASCLE, ETC, Thus, from the weight of the body, the limbs assume positions which gradually become permanent ( Volkmanii), and in young persons haye a decided influence on the forms of the articular surfaces. All these conditions may be most naturally explained on mechanical prin- ciples, while formerly the most complicated theories were based on very slight grounds, when any explanation was attempted. IV. LIMITATIONS OF MOTION IN JOINTS CAUSED BY SHORTENING OF FASCIiE AND LIGAMENTS. Any long-continued fixed position of a joint, even if not due to the above-described diseases of muscles and nerves, may lead to short- ening of the fasciae. A man who kept his left leg and thigh flexed for a year and a half, on account of suppuration of the inguinal glands, was brought to our clinic after the bubo had healed, because he could not extend the leg. This is particularly true of the fascia lata, which from a few months of quiet may become so rigid that it is sometimes impossible to extend it again. After coxitis has run its Fig. 109. Contraction of the fascia lata from coxitis, after Froriep. course, when the joint has become perfectly healthy, this contraction of the fiiscia may prove a permanent obstruction to complete exten- sion, so that such patients may occasionally limp for life ; which is another important reason for paying special attention to the position of the limbs in infljimmation of the joints.

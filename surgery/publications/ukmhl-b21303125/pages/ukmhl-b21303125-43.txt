The proper treatment of wounds is to be regm-ded as the most important requirement for the surgeon, not onlj" on account of the frec[uency of this variety of injury, but because we so often inten- tionally make them in operating, even when operating for something that is not itself dangerous to life. Hence we are ansAverable for the healing of the wound, to as great an extent as it is possible by expe- rience to judg’e of the danger of an injury. Let us commence with incised wounds. Injuries caused by sharp knives, scissors, sabres, cleavers, hatchets, etc., represent pure incised wounds. Such wounds are usually recog- nizable b}'" the regular sharp borders, where we see the smooth-cut surface of the unchanged tissue; should the instruments be blunt, by very rapid motion they may still cause quite a smooth incised wound, while by slowly entering the tissue they would give the edges of the wound a ragged appearance; occasionally, the variety of the injury does not become evident till the wound is healing, for wounds made with sharp instruments heal more readily and quickly (for reasons to be given liereafter) than tliose caused by the slow entrance of dull knives, scissors, etc. Rarely a perfectly blunt body makes a wound exactly like an incised one. This may occur from the skin being torn through by force ap- plied through a blunt object, at a point where it lies over the bone. Ihus you will not unfrequently see scalp-wounds resembling incised

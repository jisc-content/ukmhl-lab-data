LYMPHOMATA, PAPILLOMATA, 607 Both are accompanied by corresponding connective-tissue and vas- cular neoplasia. Horny papillomata come exclusively in the cutis, rarely in the walls of sebaceous cysts. We may distinguish two chief forms: (a.) TFtrris. Anatomically these consist of an excessive growth in length and thickness of the papillre. The epidermis on these abnor- mally large papUhe hornifies in the form of small rods, of which every wart is composed, as you may readily see with the naked eye (Fig. 149). These warts which, without any known cause, ajDpear espe- cially often on the hands in great numbers, are rarely larger than len- tils or peas. Fio. 149. a. k Wart: a, longitudinal sestioii; 6, cross section. Magnilied 20 diameters. {b.) Horny excrescences are to some extent large warts; the epi- dermis of the enlarged papillos adheres to a firm substance, which in- creases enormously, so that the horn, whether it be straight or twisted, may grow to three or four inches or more. Although externally these horns greatly resemble those of some animals, their anatomical struct- ure is different, for tlie latter always have a basis of bone. Homy excrescences are of a dirty-brown color; they occur chiefly on the face and scalp, but may also come on the penis and other parts of the body, and occasionally they grow from atheroma-cysts. The development of warts and Iiorny excrescences is evidently due to a general tendency of the skin that way. This is chiefly evident from the fact tliat as many as twenty or thirty warts often occur on the hands, especially of children shortly before puberty. Irritating ex- ternal influences, affecting the hands particularly, apparently combine with the fact tliat the epidermis on the hands is normally very thick.

INTRODUCTION. n '1560-1G34), of Berne, and Gottfried JPurman, of Halberstad and Breslau (about 1679), were men of great acquirements; their writ- ings show a high appreciation for their science, they fully recognized the value and imperative necessity of exact anatomical knowledge, and by their writings and private instruction imparted it to their scholars as much as possible. Among the French surgeons of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies, Ambroise Pare (1517-1590) is most prominent; originally only a barber, from his great services, he was made a member of the So- ciety of St. Come; he was very active as an army surgeon, was often called from home on consultations, and at last resided in Paris. Pare advanced surgery by what was for those times a very sharp criticism of treatment, especially of the enormous use of problematical remedies; some of his treatises, e. g., on the treatment of gun-shot wounds, are perfectly classical; he rendered himself immortal by the introduction of ligature for bleeding vessels after amputation. Pare, as the reformer of surgery, may be placed by the side of Yesal, as reformer of anatomy. The works of the above individuals, besides some others more or less gifted, held their place into the seventeenth century, and it is only in the eighteenth that we find any important advances. The strife between the members of the faculty and those of the College de St. Come still continued in Paris; the great celebrity of the latter had more effect than the professors of surgery. This was finally prac- tically acknowledged in 1731 by the foundation of an “Academy of Surgery,” which was in all respects an analogue of the medical faculty. This institution soon advanced to such a point that it ruled the sur- gery of Europe almost a century ; nor was this an isolated cause ; it formed part of the general French influence, of that universal mental dominion which the “ grande nation ” cannot even yet forget when German science has forever eclipsed French influence, after the con- flicts of 1813-14. The men who then stood at the head of the movement in surgical science were Jean Louis Petit (1674-1768), Pierre Jos. Desault (1744-1795), Pierre Francois Percy (1754- 1825), and many others in France; in Italy, Scarpa (1748-1832) Avas the most active. Even in the seventeenth century, surgery was highly developed in England, and in the eighteenth century it attained great eminence under Percival Pott (1713-1768), William and John Hunter (1728-1793), Benjamin Bell (1749-1806), William Chesel- den (1688-1752), Alexander Monro (1696-1767), and others. Among these was John Hunter, that great genius, as celebrated for anatomy as surgery; his Avork on inflammation and Avounds still forms the basis of many of our present A’ieAvs. In comparison with these, the names of the German surgeons of

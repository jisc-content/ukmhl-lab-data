119 FORMATION OF THROMBUS. Fio. 23. Kodnlarnfirve-terminations in an old ampntation-Btnmp of tlie arm. From a preparation in ilie Anatomical Museum at Bonn.

The enveloping ligature kills the enclosed tissue, which gradually breaks down into pus, and when this process is completed the ligature falls, or, as we technically express it, “ the ligature has cut through,” “ comes away.” When this has taken place, the calibre of the artery must be permanently and certainly closed, or there will at once be another hmmorrhage. Under unfavorable circumstances it may certainly happen, in small as well as in arteries of medium or large size, that the ligature cuts through too soon, and then dangerous, sudden secondary hremor- rhage occurs. We may foresee this if the wall of the artery was dis- eased ; often calcified arteries cannot be ligated, as the ligature does net compress them or cuts through them at once ; sometimes the ar- tery is softened (as, for instance, when part of its course has been through the Avail of a large abscess) so that on ligation the ligature cuts through and must be applied farther up. But unfortunately, in [)orfectly healthy subjects, as I found in the last war, haemorrhages too often occur from the point of ligation of large arteries, Avhere carefully-applied ligatures cut through before the organic closure Avas firm enough to resist the current of blood; this greatly impairs the value of such operations, Avhich are often temporarily necessary to save the patient’s life.

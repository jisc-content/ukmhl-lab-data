These symptoms are partly dependent on congestion of the mammary gland, partly on atrophy and cicatrization going on in the tumor itself. With time, in the course of some months, the tumor grows larger; the skin over it be- comes immovable, and below it adheres to the pectoral muscle. The patients frequently do not notice the commencement of the swelling of the axhlary glands, and, if the surgeonâ€™s attention be not occasion- ally directed to this region, the enlargement of these glands, which appears as a hard swelling of these parts, is not discovered till late ; sometimes also these glands lie so deep and so high under the pectoral muscle that they are not felt till the}' have grown quite large. The l}Tnphatic glands of the neck are less frequently afl'ected in cancer of the breast; when they are, the prognosis is more unfavorable. If the progress of the tumor goes on undisturbed, the course, when moder- ately rapid, is as follows: The tumor of the mammary gland and those of the axillary glands gradually unite, so as to form a nodular, wavy, immovable swelling, which at some points adheres to the skin; the pressure of the tumor on the nerves and vessels in the axilla causes neuralgic pains and oedema in the arm ; the patients, who pre- viously had felt perfectly well, arc compelled to keep in bed by the pain and swelling of the ann, which come on more especially at night, and have a piercing, boring character, while previously llioy may have 46

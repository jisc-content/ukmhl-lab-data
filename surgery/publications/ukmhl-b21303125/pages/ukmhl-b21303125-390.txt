364 TRAUMATIC AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES, ETC. sions, remains for some days at a certain height, and then ceases gradually (rarely within twenty-four hours). According to my very numerous observations, in far the greater majority of cases the trau- matic fever begins within two days after the injury. This fever is usually reiaresented graphically as follows : Fcvflr-curve nfter amputation of the aim. Recovery. This and the following fcvcr-enrves are arranged on the scale of Celsius’s thermometer. Each degree is divided into leu parts, the horizontal divisions indicate the day of the disease ; the curve is made according to tin; morning and evening measurements; the two heavy lines indicate the musiinum and minimum normal temperature of a healthy person. The curve shows that, after an amputation of the arm, rendered necessary by an injury (measurement was accidentally neglected the first day), the fever did not begin till the tliird day, then continued from the fourth to the seventh day; after the eighth day the patient remained free from fever. In other cases, however, secondary fever often occurs immediately after amputation. Such an occurrence ot tniumatic fever is quite frequent. I explain it as follows: Immedi- ately after the injury the tissue of the edges of the wound was closed by infiltration of plastic matter; the third day this commenced to break down into pus, and to mingle with decomposed shreds of tissue on the sui’face of the wound, thus inducing a moderately extensive inflammation of the amputation stump, Avith reabsorptiou of pus and other products of decomposition and inflammtition ; this reabsorption goes on till checked by some mechanical cause (diminitshed pressure.

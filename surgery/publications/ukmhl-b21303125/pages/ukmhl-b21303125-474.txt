Gentlemen : Chronic inflammations of the bones and periosteum, to which we now pass, are far more frequent than the acute forms; the more common disease is chronic periostitis, which is often accoiu- • panied bj ostitis (caries) superficialis. In the early stages this may end in resolution, then go on to sup|Duration, with ulceration of the surface of the bone; it may also be accomjjanied by a deposit of newly-formed ossific substance on the surface of the bone. Perios- titis that has lasted some time will never leave the bone unaffected. Let us fli'st consider the symptoms of chronic periostitis. Tlie first symptoms are usually slight pain, and moderate swelling of the parts immediately around the affected bone. These are accompanied by slight functional disturbances, especially when the disease is in one of the extremities. Spontaneous pain is usually slight, or may even be entirely wanting. Pressure induces severe pain, and we find that the impress of the finger remains evident on the skin for some time, showing that the swelling of the skin is chiefly cedematous. The dis- ease may remain for a long time in this stage, and may subside as gradually as it began. In such cases you may consider the affection as located in the external loose connective tissue of the periosteum. Here there is distention of the vessels, serous and plastic infiltration. Tlie symptoms above given may also depend on a periostitis com- bined with a superfcial ostitis, only in the latter case the spontaneous pains are occasionally more intense; there are also severe, boring,

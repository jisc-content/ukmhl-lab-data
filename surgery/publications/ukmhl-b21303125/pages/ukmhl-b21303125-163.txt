ANEURISM FROM PUNCTURED WOUxNDS. 137 the blood may detach it from the tunica media; this forms a variety of aneurism called aneurisma dissecans (dissecting aneurism). Cases of punctured wounds with subsequent aneurisms occur particularly in military practice, but not unfrequently also in civil practice. I saw a bo}’- with an aneurism, as large as a hen’s-egg, of the femoral artery, about the middle of the thigh, that had been caused by puncture with a pen-knife, on which the boy fell. A short time since I operated on an aneurism of the radial artery, that had developed in a shoemaker after an accidental puncture with an awl. An aneurism is a tumor communicating directly or indirectly until the calibre of an artery. This is the common definition. The communication is immediate in the case just described of a simple traumatic aneurism. Still, the anatomical conditions of this tumor may, be more complicated. For instance, in a venesection at the bend of the elbow, that is, from intentionally puncturing a vein for the purpose of abstracting blood, besides the vein, the brachial artery may be wounded ; this is one of the most frequent causes of traumatic aneurism, or at least was so formerly, when bleeding was more common. In such a case, besides the dark, venous blood, we may readily perceive the bright, arterial blood; the whole arm is at once bound up and the artery compressed, and in some cases the openings in both vessels heal at once without further consequences. But occasioTaally it happens that this accident is followed by an aneurism ; this may have the simple form above de- scribed ; but the openings in the two vessels may so grow together that part of the arterial blood wiU flow directly into the vein as into an arterial branch, and must then meet the stream of venous blood.

TRANSLATORâ€™S PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION. Since this translation was revised from the sixth German edition in 1874, two other German editions have been pub- lished. The present revision is made to coiTespond to the eighth German edition. In order to make use of the stereotyjie plates of the former edition as far as possible, some of the additions have been inserted in an appendix. These are hnmbered, and are referred to in the text by corresponding numbers. Lister's method of antisejitic treatment is referred to in various places; and other new points that have come np within a few years are discussed. A chapter has been written on ampu- tations and resections. In all there are seventy-four additional pages, with a number of new woodcuts. CIIAS. E. HACKLEY, M.D. New York, December, IStS.

Gentlemen: So far we have treated only of injuries, now we shall pass to the aente inflammations which are of non-traumatic origin. Of these cases, those belong to surgery that occur on the outer part of the body; also those which, occurring in internal organs, are still accessible to surgical treatiaent. Although I must start with the idea that you already know the causes of disease in general, it still seems necessary to make some preliminary remarks with special reference to the subject of which we are about to treat. The causes of acute non-traumatic inflammations may be divided into about the following categories: 1. Repeated Mechanical or Chemical Lritation.—At the first glance, this seems to come under the head of trauma, but it makes considerable difference whether such an irritation acts once on a tissue or whether it be frequently repeated, for, in the latter case, each suc- ceeding irritation affects a tissue already irritated. An example will make this clear to you. Suppose a person is rubbed continuously by a projecting -sharp nail in his boot or shoe; at first there would be a slight wound with circumscribed inflammation, but afterward the inflammation will spread and become more intense as long as the irii- tation lasts. Let us take another example of chemical in-itation: If a person not accustomed to highly-seasoned food eats Spanish pepper

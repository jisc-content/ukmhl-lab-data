Magnified 25 diameters. begins again. As we have already seen when studying the detacli- inent of necrosed shreds of tissue, vascular loops must form on this border of the living tissue; that is, the whole inner surface of an abscess, in the arrangements of its vessels, is analogous to a granula- ting surface folded up sac-like. In regard to tlie lymphatic vessels, we may conclude from antilogy that here, as in the vicinity of wounds, they are closed by the inflam- matory neoplasia; special investigations on this subject would be very desirable. So soon and so long as an abscess is surrounded by a vigorous layer of tissue infiltrated with plastic matter, for rea.sons already mentioned there will be no reabsorj^tion of purulent or putrid substances from the cavity of the abscess. I can give you practical e\ddence of this, if in the clinic you will smell pus from an abscess near the rectum or in the mouth; this pus has an exceedingly penc*- trating, putrid odor, still is not reabsorbed by the walls of the veins, or is so to only a very slight e.xtent; symptoms of general sepsis very rarely occur. But at the commencement of inflamination, and later, when it is accompanied by rapid destruction of tissue, as well as in some progressive inflanunations around contused wounds, and in phlegmonous inflammation of the cellular tissue, etc., if flie li'inphatio vâ€™essels are not yet stopjicd by cell-formation, organized inflammatory uew formation does not occur, or comes on late as the gangrenous

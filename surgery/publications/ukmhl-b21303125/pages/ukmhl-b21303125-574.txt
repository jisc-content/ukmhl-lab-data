CnROXIC INFLAMMATION OF THE JOINTS. 548 Fia. 108. never so elastic as to adajot itself by this means alone to all positions of the joint. If you imagine a humerus lying on the thorax, then at the lower part of the joint the capsule would have to be firmly drawn together, abo\’e it would have to be greatly stretched; if you imagine the arm raised as high as possible, the upper part of the capsule would have to be strongly drawn together, and the lower stretched; the articular cap- sule would have to be as elas- tic as rubber; this is not the case: on changing the extreme positions of the joint, it con- tracts little or not at all; it folds up in certain directions; if the position of the joint changes, the fold smooths out, and on the opposite side which was previously smooth another fold forms in the capsule. You here see perpendicular sections of the shoulder-joint, parallel to the anterior surface of the body (seen from the, front, af- ter Henle) in an elevated posi- tion (Fig. I07),hanging by the side (Fig. 108). If the synovial membrane become diseased, the joint u§.u; ally remains in a certain posi- tion, the humerus is generally depressed, the lower part of the synovial sac (Fig. 108, a) may suppurate, shrink, and become adherent; then, even if the joint were otherwise healthy, it would be impossi- ble to raise the arm, because the capsule at the lower part of the joint could not unfold.

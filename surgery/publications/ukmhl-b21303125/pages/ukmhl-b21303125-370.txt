344 TRAUMATIC AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES, ETC. ter has very deleterious properties) the whole cornea may become gangrenous in tweifty-four hours, and the growth of the coccus hardly be as great as in the first instance. Lastly, cases occur where the coccus grow'th induces no reaction in the cornea, but disappears without leaving a trace; this is even the rule in inoculating the cornea of the dog.

After Frisch. From this it follows that the intensity and nature of inflamma- tions induced by such contagions do not depend on the coccus pro- liferation itself, but on the injurious qualities of the matter conveyed with the coccus. I thought you should be told these things, so that you would have some knowledge about processes which are now so much dis- cussed. I recommend for your special study the excellent mono- graph on hospital gangrene by C. Heine. 3. Erysipelas traumaticum. Erysipelas, as previously mentioned (page 281), is classed among the acute exanthemata, and is charac- terized by a diffuse swelling, rosy redness of the skin, and jiain, as well as by the accompanying fever, which is usually severe. Erysip- elas has a peculiar relation to the other exanthemata ; on the one hand, because it often accompanies wounds, although it may appar- ently come spontaneously; on the other hand, because it does not generally spread by such an intense contagion as measles, scarlatina, etc.; lastly, also because, when one has had this disease, he is not only not safe from another attack of it, but in some cases is even pecu- liarly predisposed to it. As I dare hardly assume that you have al- ready studied skin-diseases carefull\', we will here briefly review the symptoms of this disease. Its commencement may vary by the fever preceding the exanthema,

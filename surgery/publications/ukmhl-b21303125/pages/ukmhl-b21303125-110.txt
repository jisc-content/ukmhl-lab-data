SIMPLE INCISED WOUNDS OF THE SOFT PARTS. 84 Fine sections cannot be made of granulation tissue, just taken from a -wound ; it is generally a very difficult subject for fine prepara- tions. If you harden the granulation tissue in alcohol, color I he seo tion with carmine, then clear it up with glycerine, you have a speci- men like Fig, 11. PlO. II. * Qranulation tissue. Magnified 300 diameters. The tissue appears to consist solely of cells and vessels, with very thin walls ; the whole tissue is shrunken by the alcohol, so that we here see nothing of the mucous intercellular substance which is al- ways present, even if only in small quantities, in healthy, fresh granu- lations. We see the tissue of the young cicatrix particularly well in the folio-wing preparation (Fig. 12), which was taken from a broad cica- trix, following granulation and suppuration, in the back of a dog, about four or five weeks after the injury.

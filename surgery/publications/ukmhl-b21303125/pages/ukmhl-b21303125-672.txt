TUMORS. C46 not admit this. If it is desired to term the inflammatory neoplasias in their various stages examples of sarcoma {lUndJleisch), I assent tc it, as this definition would agree pretty well with mine. After this anatomical basis was found for “ sarcoma,” it soon ap- peared that it could be diagnosed, even with the naked eye, and that clinically also something could be said about the peculiar course of these tumors. As I think that the subdivisions, according to histo- logical peculiarities, are less important for the diagnosis of these tu- mors during life, and that their diagnosis, prognosis, and course, de- pend so much on their point of origin, the rapidity of their growth, etc., I prefer hereafter classing together the clinical remarks on sar- coma, and here merely considering more attentively the histology. We shall divide sarcoma into the following forms : Fig. 130. {a.) Gramdation sarcoma, round-celled sar- coma of Virchow. This tissue is the same, or very like that of the upper layer of granulations ; it always contains chiefly small round cells, like lymph-cells; the intercellular substance is some- times scarcely perceptible, again it is in greater quantities, and may be perfectly homogeneous, as in neuroglia ( Virchow's glioma and giio-sarcoma). Tissue, of a grauuiation pr it is slio'htly striated (Fig. 130), or even fibrous, diameters. or may be oedematous (as in large mammar}’- sar- comata). Lastly, it may also be reticulate, and so approximate the ti.s- sue of lipoma. Fig. 131. Tissue of a gUo-sarcoma. after Virchow. Magnified 350 diameters. ib.) Spindle-celled sarcoma is composed of closel3--packed, usually thin', elongated spindle-cells, so-called filament-cells. Usually there

Giant-celled sarcoma is a name given by Virchow to a variety of sarcoma containing very large cells, which are partly round, partly polymorphous, and supplied with many offshoots (Fig. 133). These cells, which normally occur in the medulla of the bones of the foetus, although not so large as in tumors, have excited great astonishment by their size; they are the largest un- formed protoplasm collections that Giant-ceile from !i sarcoma of the lower have been seen in man : they may contain thirty or more nuclei, and their origin from a simjsle cell by a series of transformations is gen- erally easily followed. These giant-cells occur in spindle-celled, as well as in fibro-sarcoma; they occur somewhat smaller sporadically, and are also found in granulation and myxosarcomata. They are most Fio. 1.34, (Jlnnt-ccllccl sarcoma with cysts and ossifyinp foci from tlie lower jaw.

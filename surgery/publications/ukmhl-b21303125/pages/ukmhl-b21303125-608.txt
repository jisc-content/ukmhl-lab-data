5fe2 VARICES AND ANEURISMS. circulation; the collateral arteries, besides dilating, become tortuous; the process is evidently the same in both cases. We have also to mention that these aneurisms are particularly apt to develop in young persons, in whom the chronic diseases leading to other aneurisms are Fig. 114.

The diagnosis of cirsoid aneurism is very simple, if, as is usu- ally the case, it lies just under the skin; it has been found more deeply seated, as in the gluteal artery, but it is more frequent on the head ; here we may feel, and occasionally see, the tortuous pulsating artery, so that the disease is readily recognized; it is not frequent. ^Ve have still to mention that the arterial wall may become dis- eased by a suppuration or ulceration extending from the neighboring parts, first to the adventitia, then to the other coats; this is the ciise more rarely in acute abscesses than in chronic ulcerations. As an example of this we see that, in the development of cavities in the lungs, it not unfrequently happens tliat the ulceration attacks the walls of the smaller arteries, and the adventitia is partly dcstro3-ed and softened. The result of this is, that the artery dilates at tin's point.

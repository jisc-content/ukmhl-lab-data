While in the last-mentioned case, as often happens, the papillary hypertrophy appeared at the very commencement of the development of the tumor as an essentially characteristic part, in other cases it is of an entirely secondary nature, i. e., the epithelial rods on the sur- face of the skin or mucous membrane soften, fall out, and leave the vascular connective-tissue portion in the form of a pouched ulcer, from which different papillary tufts protrude or subsequently grow. Carcinoma of the skin may begin as indurated papilloma, or as a wart, but just as often it begins as a nodule Avhen the proliferation is at first circumscribed, grows into the skin ; it enlarges slowly, without grow- ing by apposition of new, small carcinoma nodules. The carcinoma- tous proliferation may also enter and grow through the cutis from a gradually-increasing surface, without causing any great j^romi- nence. There is a decided difference between cancers of the skin, accord- ing as the epithelial proliferation enters the cutis more or loss deeply; some cases remain quite sui^erficial, scarcely entering the subcuta- neous cellular tissue, and growing very slowly (fiat epithelial cancer, Thiersch); others grow rapidly and enter the tissue deeply, destroy- ing it (infiltrated epithelial cancer, 'Thiersch).

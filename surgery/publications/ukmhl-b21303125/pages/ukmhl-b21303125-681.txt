G55 SARCOMATA. pliination 'svill hardly answer, for it is not very probable that tumor cells would lie quiet in the tissue for years, and then suddenly shoot out like an old seed. I know no explanation for this mode of recur- rence. The course of the infection is very peculiar in sarcoma; Lthink I was one of the first to show that it is an essential peculiarity of sar- coma, that it does not attack the lymphatic glands, or does so quite late in the disease. The course of sarcoma-infection goes chiefly, if not exclusively, through the veinsâ€”not, as in carcinoma, through the lymphatic vessels. Sarcomata of the lungs are mostly of emboUc origin; it seems that the walls of the veins in sarcoma are very readily traversed by the tumor-substance, and their calibre filled with friable masses of it, which thence pass into the lungs. The number of the secondary sarcomata is often enormous, the whole pleura and peri- tonaeum may be covered with them. In this respect, the melanotic forms almost appear to dispute the precedence with the medullary. Primary, only partially-pigmented tumors are occasionally followed Fig. 140. Fia. 141.

SIMPLE INCISED WOUNDS OF THE SOFT PARTS. 60 normal tissue toward the wound. Tlie injury represents an inflamma- tory irritation, whose action may extend somewhat beyond the im- mediate vicinity of the irritation, but then rapidly diminishes. Fig. 3 a. Vein and capillary vessel from the mesentery of a frog', which has lain exposed for some hours. Red blood-cells from the circulation; wliite blood-cells lying against the walls and wandering into the loose connective tissue of the mesentery. Magnilidd about bUO diameters. In the gâ€™reat majority of cases there will be at least a slight layer of coagulated blood between the flaps of the wound ; this also extends somewhat into the interstices of the tissue of the flaps of the wound. This blood-clot may sometimes interfere with the healing, as when, from its size or other casues, it decomposes or turns to pus ; but it may also become cicatricial tissue and perfectly disappear Avith tiie new formation in the flaps of the wound; this must take place for union by the first intention to occur. We shall hereafter speak of the changes that take place in the clotted blood during this process. We must now attend to the question, Whence come the innumera- ble wandering cells that infiltrate all inflamed tissues immediately after

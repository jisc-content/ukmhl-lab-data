158 CONTUSED AND LACERATED WOUNDS OF THE SOFT PARTS. Diagram of llio proccsp of clctnclimoiit of (loncl comiectlve tlpsuo in contused wounds. Magi I- fled aOO diameters: a, crushed necrosed purl; i, living tissue; c, surface of the wound. Tn the portion of connective tissue represented, suppose c, the border of tlie wound, be so destroyed by the injury that its circulation is arrested and it is no longer nourished ; the blood is coagulated in the vessels as far as the shading extends in the diagram. Now cell- infiltration and inflammatory new formation begin at the outer edge of the living tissue, at the border between a and b where the vessels termi- nate in loops; these vascular loops dilate, grow, and multiply ; in the tissue the infiltration is constantly increased by wandering cells, as if the edge of the wound were here; granulation tissue is formed; this turns to pus, on the surface, that is, close to the dead tissue, and then of course the necrosed part falls, because its cohesion with the living tissue has ceased. Hence detachment of the necrosed shreds of tissue results from inflammation with suppuration ; when the dead por- tion of tissue has fallen, the subjacent, suppurating layer of granula- tions comes to light, having been already developed before the detachment of the necrosed jtart. What you here see in connective tissue is ti'ue of the other tissues, bone not excepted. Fia. 39.

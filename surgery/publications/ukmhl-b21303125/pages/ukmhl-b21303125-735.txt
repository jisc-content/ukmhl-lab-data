CARCINOMATA. 709 times they are more diffusely spread in the upper jaw. In these mu- cous-gland cancers of the lace I have never seen infection of the lym- phatic glands, and am convinced that these patients could be saved by an early complete operation. In all the patients that I have oj^erated on, I have never been satisfied that the tumor was entirely removed by the operation; it always projected too far posteriorly or upward to per- mit the operation to be completed with safety. Hence, I usually wit- nessed local recurrences, which proved fatal by marasmus or pressure on the brain, or else the jaatient died from the extent of the operation; in none of the cases examined post mortem did I find internal tumors. In the stomach gland-cancers are frequent, especially with mucous softening (gelatinous cancer), and secondary cancer of the liver ; can- cer of the duodenum is very rare; of the parts of the intestinal canal attacked by this disease we are only interested in the cancers of the rectum. These are almost exclusively gland-cancers, and the prolifer- ation proceeds from the large glands of the large intestine, which grow in the shpqDe of tortuous and branched tubes; the calibre of the gland is often maintained, and they fill with mucus, and the cylinder- cells may maintain their form and become A^ery large. The intersti- Fig. 16J. Adenoid cancer of the rectum. Magnified 200 diameters. tial connective tissue is strewn with small, round cells, sometimes softened, and often very vascular. Usually at first the muscular coat of the intestine is hypertroidiied; subsequently it also is affected bv â€¢ he ulceration, which generally begins early.

TUBERCULOSIS 419 whole, modern observers are little inclined to this view. Hmdjleisch, Idunclrat, and others hold that tubercle-cells develop mostly fiâ€™om proliferation of endothelium, especially that of the blood-vessels, lymphatics, and serous membranes. Mindfleisch thinks they may also develop from the muscle-cells of the arteries ; Ziegler has proved that they may result from confluence .of wandering cells. Pig. 71 a. Giant cells from tubercle in various stages of development. After LangUans. Magnified about 400. Regarding the subsequent fate of these small neoplasia, the most essential and peculiar thing about them is that vessels do not de- velop in them any more tlian in purely epithelial neoplasia, although their periphery is very vascular. Very rarely cases occur where the tubercles gradually become filament-nodules. While every other neoplasm is accompanied by growth of vessels, in tubercles this is wanting entirely, as has been lately shown again by Rindfleisch, Jleitzmann^ and others, ddie rcsrdt of this is that the young neo- plasia cannot live long; it dies in the centre, but (he periphery sur- vives. The dead centre occasionally breaks down into a fine, punc- tate, amoridmus substance, which to the naked eye appears as a

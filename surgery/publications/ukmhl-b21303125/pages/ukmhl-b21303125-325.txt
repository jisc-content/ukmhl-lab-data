299 ‘inflammations of subcutaneous mucous BUES^'E. swelling of the limb continues, if crepitation appears in the joint be- tween the bones of the wrist (showing that the cartilaginous coverings have suppurated), and if the patient continues to sink, there is little hope of a termination in anchylosis of the hand, but the danger to life is so great that amputation of the forearm should be made; the patient may thus escape with his life, and will soon recover his strength. Acute inflammations of the subcutaneous mucous bur see are less dangerous; the bursa prsepatellaris and anconea are most frequently affected either from injury or spontaneously; they are connected neither with the joint nor with the sheaths of the tendons ; they be- come painful. All with fibrinous serum, the skin reddens, and the cel- lular tissue in the vicinity participates in the inflammation; but sup- puration rarely occurs if the patient is treated early. The remedies are mercurial ointment or tincture of iodine, keeping the limb quiet, and compressing the swollen bursa by applying wet bandages. Puncture is unnecessary, and may be injurious, from being followed bv suppuration and a tedious suppm’ating fistula.

200 SIMPLE FRACTURE OF BONES. because if llie periosteum aloue formed the external callus, as was formerly supposed, tlie portions of the bone free of })fâ€˜riosteuni, as those ])laces Avhere tendons are attached to the bone, could form no callus; this is directly contradicted by observation. In nortnal growth, also, the periosteum does not by any means play the im- portant part ascribed to it in the formation of bone; for we may just as correctly regard the layer of young cells lying on the surface of the bone, and extending into the Haversian canals, as belonging to the bone, as to refer it to the periosteum.

As appears, the ossifying cuiius is not limited to the periosteum, but extends in betweeu the muscles. Recent investigations concerning the growth of bones, made by fZ render it A'ery probable tliat they increase in all directions by interstitial deposit of young cs.seous tissue, and hence that growth by a]iposition througli the epi])hyseal cartilages and perios- teum can no longer be regarded as the sole source of increase in length and thickness; such a mode of growth is jdaced beyond a

This is a brief explanation of the perceptible changes in the borders of the wound, the redness and increased heat caused by the rapid development of the collateral circulation, by which more blood flows through the vessels nearer the surface; the swelling is caused by the distention of the vessels and swelling of the tissues, which again induces slight compression of the nerves, and this excites some pain. This, as it seems to mo, very simple mechanical explanation, would be much more valuable, if it fully explained the whole subsequent course, and could be applied to all inflammations, which are not of traumatic or mechanical origin. But this is not the case. Ncithei the great vascular distention that occurs some time after injury, that shows itself in extensive redness around the Avound, nor the cajiillary dilatation that exists from the first in idiopathic inflammations, can be referred to purely mechanical causes.

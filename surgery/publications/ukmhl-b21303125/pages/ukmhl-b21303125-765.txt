APPEITDIX. ADDITIONS FROM THE EIGHTH GERMAN EDITION. 1. —P. 33. To avoid the clanger from venous congestion after constricting the limb, before applying the tourniquet we may apply a bandage firmly to the extremity from below upward, and thus press the blood out from the limb. Formerly this procedure was applied to limbs about to be amputated, and thus the haemorrhage was reduced to a minimum. Grandesso Silvestri, a physician of Vicenza, rec- ommended elastic bandages for this purpose, and instead of the tour- niquet applied a thick elastic tube several times around the limb. In ignorance of this advice, which was little known, Esmarch re- sorted to the same method, and called attention to the great bene- fits derived from it; since when it has become very popular. In fact, by means of this appliance long operations may be done without loss of blood. The extremities may be rendered bloodless and kept so for an hour without injuring their vitality. After ligat- ing all the visible vessels, the elastic tube is to be loosened, and the blood will again enter the vessels; if any more then permit the escape of blood, thej’ may be ligated. This method of making a limb bloodless and keeping it so is a great advance in modern sur- gery ; and by this means operations may be done which without it we should not have dared to attempt. 2. —P. 37. Recently I have tried the Penghawar Djambi a few times, and can testify that when c[uantitics of it are pi-essed firmly on the wound it acts better than charpie as a styptic; I will not pretend to say that it is better than liquor ferri, but it smears the wound less, even if left

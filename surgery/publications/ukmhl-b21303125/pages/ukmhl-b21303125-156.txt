Most punctured wounds are simple wounds, and usually heal by first intention; many of them are at the same time incised wounds, when the puncturing instrument has a certain breadth; some have the characteristics of contused wounds, when the puncturing instru- ment was blunt; in this case there is generally more or less suppura- tion. We make many punctured wounds with our surgical instru- ments, as with acupuncture needles—fine, long needles, that we occasionally employ to examine whether and how deep below a tumor or ulcer the bone is destroyed, etc.; with acupressure needles^ wliich we use for arresting haemorrhage; with the trocar., a dagger with a three- sided point, furnished with a closely-fitting canula, an instrument for drawing off fluid from cavities. Dirk, sword, knife, and bayonet punctures are often simultaneously incised and contused wounds. If these punctured wounds be not accompanied by injury of large arteries, veins, or bones, and do not enter any of the cavities of the body, they often heal rapidly and without treatment. The most frequent punctured wounds are those made with needles, especially in women, and how rarely a doctor is called for them ! Such an injury is only complicated by a needle, or a part of one, en- tering the soft parts so deeply that it cannot readily be extracted. This occasionally happens in diflerent parts of the body, as from a person sitting or falling on a needle, or some such accident. If a needle has entered deei) under the skin, the .symptoms are usually so

184 CONTUSED AND LACERATED WOUNDS OF THE SOFT PARTS. from the roof of the liouse against whicli the scaffold rested there hung a loop; the falling man grasped this, but only succeeded in get- ting the middle linger of the right hand through the loop; he hung a moment and then fell to the ground. Fortunately, the height was not great, and he was not injured, but the middle finger of the right hand was gone; it was torn out at the joint between the first phalanx and the metacarpal bone, and it still hung in the loop. The two tendons of the flexors and that of the extensor remained attached to the fin- ger; they had been torn off just at the insertion of the muscles; the man dried his finger with the tendons, and subsequently carried it in his purse as a memento of the circumstance. I saw a similar case in the clinic at Zurich (Fig. 41). Cure resulted without much inflam- mation of the forearm, and actually no treatment was required. In Zurich I saw two cases where the hand was torn out; in one case there was enough skin remaining to leave the healing to itself, in the other case an amputation of the forearm was necessary. Both cases terminated favorably. In war it is not very rare for arms and legs to be torn from their sockets by large cannon-balls. I have also seen a case where a boy fourteen years old had the right arm with the scap- ula and clavicle so torn from the thorax, by a wheel of machinery, that it was only attached at the shoulder by a strip of skin two inches wide (Fig. 42). The axillary artery did not bleed a drop; both ends were closed by torsion (Fig. 40). The unfortunate fellow died soon after the injury. Tearing out of entire extremities is usu- ally quickly fatal.

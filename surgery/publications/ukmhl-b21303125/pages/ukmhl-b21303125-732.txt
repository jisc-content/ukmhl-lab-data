TUMORS. 706 lymphoid cells is very decidedly the predominant morbid process. \\ Idle the epithelial proliferation is very secondary, I formerly tried to give this form of cancer of the breast the name of “ connective-tissue cancer.” But, as this has led to misinterpretation in regard to the modern anatomical understanding of carcinoma, I shall not try to preserve tliis term. Fia. 1C7. Cellular inflltration of the fatty tissue in the periphery of a hard cancer of the breast; the blood- vessels injected. Magnified 200 diameters. The peculiar anatomical and clinical course has caused some sur- geons to strike this new formation from the list of tumors, and par- ticularly from that of cancers. If we examine more closely the clinical course of these cases, we have already noticed that they usually only occur in old joersons, and that tlie local disease progresses slowly; some cases last seven or eight years before half of one breast is atro- phied. The general health meantime remains unimpaired. The lymphatic glands occasionally participate in the disease; in this case the process goes on just as in the mamma ; thei’e is very little enlarge- ment, but much hardening and cicatricial shrinking. The more rap- idly and completely the new formation atrophies, and the more slowly the process extends, the more injurious it is; after e.xtirpation or cauterization this variety of cancer does not recur for a long time, if it does so at all; metastatic tumors are rare ; in the main, the infiltra- tion does not appear to differ much, anatomically, from that in chronic hepatitis and nephritis with subsequent shrinking; why, then, distin- guish this scirrhus from those processes ? 'Wernher terms this disease of the mamma cirrhosis mammoe. I recognize perfectly the justice of doubting the carcinomatous nature of some cases of scirrhous mam-

UNION OF WOUNDS. 51 to the next points of intersection of the capillary net-work. Some co- agulated blood usually remains also between the flaps of the wound; Fiq. 1. Diugrani of connective tissue, with capillaries. Magnified 300-400. we have omitted this in Fig. 2, so as to have the simplest possible rep- resentation of the changes. Of the channels for the circulation in our diagram, some liave become impassable; the blood must accommodate itself to the existing by-pathsâ€”of coui'se this takes place under a heavier arterial pressure than previously; this pressure is greater the greater the obstruction to the circulation, and the less numerous the by-paths (of the so-called collateral circulation). The result of this increased pressure is the distention of the vessels (which, however, is usually much greater than could be represented in the diag'ram), hence the redness about the wound, and to some extent also the swelling. But the latter also has another cause : the more the capillary Avails are distended, the thinner they become ; if under the ordinary ]Aress- ure, with normal thickness of their walls, they permit blood plasma to pass to nourish the tissues, now under increased pressure, more plasma than normal will pass through the Avails, Avhich saturates

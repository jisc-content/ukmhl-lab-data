217 UNION OF OPEN FRACTURES. In this state, but, -while the osseous granulations on the surface con- dense to connective tissue and cicatrize, in the deeper parts they ossify quite rapidly, so that at the termination of the process of heal- ing the surface of the injured bone does not sho-w a deficiency, but appears denser from deposit of new bone. You see that here too the cu-cumstances are exactly the same as in subcutaneous development of the inflammatory neoplasia. If you look at Fig. 49, and suppose tlie periosteum removed from the surface of the bone, the new formation (in this case as granulations) will grow fungous-like out of the Haver- sian canals. You will understand this better if we now follow more carefully the process of detachment of necrosed portions of bone. Let us re- turn to what we see with the naked eye, and let us suppose we have before us a portion of the parietal bone denuded of soft parts ; then, if no granulations, as above described, grow from the bone, we shall liave the following symptoms: While the surrounding soft parts and the portion of bone still covered with periosteum have already pro- duced numerous granulations and secrete pus, the dead portion of bone remains pure white or becomes gray or even blackish. It re- mains some weeks, sometimes two months or more; mosr proliferant granulations grow around it; cicatrization has already begun in the periphery of the wound, and we cannot decide how the case will ter- minate, for in the sixth week the surface of the bone may look just as it did the day after injury. Some day we feel the bone and find it Fig. 5i. Detaehmont of n superficlnl piece of a flat bone (ns of one of the cranial bones) which has been cx- thri vW n, and become necrosed.

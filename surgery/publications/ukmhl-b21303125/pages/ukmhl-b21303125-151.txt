125 FORMATION OF THROMBUS. Fig. 30. Portion of a transverse section of a human femoral vein, with an organized vascular thrombus, 18 days after amputation of the thigh; a a, Tunica intlma j b b, media; c c, adventitia ; d d, enveloping cellular tissue; 2%, organized thrombus with vessels; the layering of the fibrine is still distinctly visible in the periphery of the thrombus. Magnified 100 diameters. partly enclosed in the thrombus, partly may have -wandered into it, according to the observations of V. RecTdingliausen and Huhnoff. As regards the red blood-cells, it seems that they gradually unite with the coagulated fibrine, lose their shape, become intercellular substance, and lose their coloring matter, which is separated as granules or crys- tals of hematoidin. Little as we know whence blood-cells come, and whither they go, still it is certain that the white cells enter the blood from the lymphatic vessels, and that they enter the latter from the lymphatic glands or connective tissue elsewhere ; they are cells that originate directly from connective-tissue cells, or from a protoplasm analogous to connective tissue. Are these cells still viable when en- closed in a blood-clot? After coming to rest here, can they transform themselves to tissue ? It is impossible to allinn or deny these questions alisolutely ; since liuhnojf has shown that wandering cells enter the thrombus, and may there continue their moveiuents, there is no necessity for supposing that the white blood-cells (which are identical with wandering cells) enclosed in the thrombus, on coagula-

123 FORMATION OF THROMBUS. If you draw conclusions from these preparations, presented in such a fragmentary way, it appears that in the clotted blood there is a cel- lular infiltration, which here leads to development of connective tissue; in short, that the thrombus becomes organized. The thrombus is not a permanent tissue, but gradually disappears again, or, at least, is re- duced to a minimum, a fate which it shares with many new formations resulting from inflammation. Fio. 28. Completely-organized thrombus in tlic human arteria tibialis posticn. a, Thrombus with ves- sels, perfectly united with the innermost layer of the intima; 6, the lamella! of the tunica iiitima; c. the tunica musciilaris, traversed by numerous connective tissue and elastic fila- ments; d, Tunica adventitia. Magnified 300 diameters. Miav RindJUisch. Peculiar reasons caused me to investigate more accurately the or- ganization of the thrombus. The importance of this process is rather extensive; a point on which you cannot at present judge well, but will hereafter be in a position to estimate fully, when we come to treat of diseases of the vessels. From my investigations up to the loroscnt time, I do not think I dare retract the assertion that coagulated fibrine may, by aid of cells, be transformed into connective-tissue intercellular substance, althoiurh I cannot decide whether this be due to true metamorphosis, or to a gradual substitution of cell protoplasm for disappearing libriue. Some have attempted to refer the origin of the cells, which appear in con-

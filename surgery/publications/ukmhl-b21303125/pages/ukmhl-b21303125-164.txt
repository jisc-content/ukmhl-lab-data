138 SOME PECULIARITIES OF PUNCTURED WOUNDS. causes obstruction of the venous current and consequent sacculations, dilatations of the calibre of the vein, which we generally term vari- ces ; in this particular case the varix is called varix aneurismaticus, because it communicates with an artery like an aneurism. Another case may arise: an aneurism forms between the artery and vein, both of which communicate with the aneurismal sac. Fio. 37. Anearisma varicosnm. a, Brachial artery: b, median vein. The aneurismal sac is cut open j Dorsey, Froriep, “Surgical Copperplates.” Bd. HI., Taf. 263. We call this aneitrisma varicosum. There may also be some varieties in the relation of the aneurismal sac, vein, and artery, to each other, wliich, however, are only important as being curious, and change neither the symptoms nor treatment, and fortunately have no particular names. In all these cases where arterial blood flows directly or indi- rectly through an aneurismal sac into the veins, there is distention of the veins and a thrill in them, which may be both felt and heard, and may even be occasionally perceived in .the arteries; it probably results from the meeting of the currents. However, this thrill in the vessels is not characteristic of the above state, for it may sometimes be in- duced simply by pressure on the veins, and occurs in some diseases of the heart. We also occasionally see a weak pulsation in veins dis- tended by the above causes, which would even earlier give a correct diagnosis. Quite recently I saw a number of aneurisms resulting from gun- shot-wounds ; in three cases affecting the femoral and external iliac arteries, the above-mentioned thrill was very prominent, rendering it pretty certain that there was a communication between the artery and vein, as was proved by autopsy in one case; but there were no varices in any of these cases; hence their development is not a neces-

SARCOMATA. 651 Alveolar sarcoma from the deltoid mnscle. Alveolar s.arcoma from the tibia. Ma^ified 400 diameters. Magnified 400 diameters. (/,) Pigmentary sarcoma. Melanotic sarcoma. Melanoma. Ail these names indicate j^igment formation in sarcoma. This joigment, which is usually granular, rarely diffuse, is brown or black, lies almost always in the cells, rarely in the intercellular substance. Part or the whole of the tumor may be faintly or distinctly black. Any of the above forms of sarcoma may occasionally be pigmented, but I have most frequently found this to be the case in the last form, and in the spindle-celled sarcoma. Melanomata develop most frequently in the cutis, especially of the foot and hand, but also on the head, neck, and trunk. The arrangement of the cellular elements in sarcoma depends, on the one hand, on certain directions of the fibres or fibre-cells in the tissue of the tumor; on the other, on the form of the vascular net- work ; from those circumstances, as well as from the development of giant-cells, or similar formations, there may result an arrangement of the tissue of the tumor, scarcely distinguishable from the areolar formation formerly ascribed exclusivel}'’ to carcinoma-tissue. This sliould not astonish you, for in cartilage also we have a tyjie of cavi- ties with enclosed cells, and also the net-work of the lympliatic glands, which undoubtedly belong to the system of connective-tissue sub- stances, but must also be termed alveolar formations.®^ Fie. 138.

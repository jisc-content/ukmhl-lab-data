Wemav sometimes heal these fistulm by cauterization with nitrate of silver and compression by adhesive plaster; but in some cases they are very ob- stinate. Then you may attempt, by injecting tincture of iodine, to excite a more intense suppuration of the inner well of the sac, and thus cause it to atrophy or become adherent; but a quicker way is to introduce a blunt-pointed knife through the fistula and slit up the sac and superjacent skin, so as to expose the whole interior; granula-

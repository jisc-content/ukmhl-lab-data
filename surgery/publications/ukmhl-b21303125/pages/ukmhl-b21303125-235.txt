209 TREATMENT OF FRACTURES. days old, wlien there is already considerable inflammatory svvelling, you may even then apply the firm dressing, but must apply it more loosely, and with plenty of wadding. This dressing will be too loose, and should be renewed in ten or twelve days, when the swelling has left the soft parts. It will chiefly depend on the looseness of the bandage, and the greater or less tendency to dislocation, when and how often the dressing should be removed during the treatment. Swelling, if not accompanied by considerable contusion, is no contra- indication to a carefully-applied firm bandage ; nor do large or small vesicles, full of clear or slightly-bloody serum, present any great ob- jection ; such vesicles result not unfrequently from contused fractures with extensive rupture of the deep veins, since, from obstruction to the flow of venous blood, the serum readily escapes from the capilla- ries, and elevates the hard layer of the epidermis into a vesicle; we puncture these vesicles with a needle, gently press out the fluid, and apply some wadding, and they soon dry up. It is the same with slight superficial excoriations of the skin ; we are only rarely obliged to remove the dressing and apply another, Avhen new vesicles form, as we may know by the pain. The length of time that a firm dressing must remain on for the different fractures you will learn partly in the clinic, partly from S23e- oial surgery ; I simply mention here, as the limits, that a finger may require a fortnight, a thigh sixty days, or more, for healing. If you apply the plaster-dressing immediate!}’’ after the fracture, dislocation having been completely removed, the provisional callus wiU always be less, and hence firmness result later, than where there is some dis- location and the dressing is applied later; but this has no effect on the formation of definitive callus, and the actual union of the frac- tured ends of the bone.

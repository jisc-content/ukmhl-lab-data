TRAUxMATIC AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES, ETC. 878 and cholera. Usually, however, these chills are not repeated, but only the onset of the disease is accompanied by thi.s symptom ; it seem.s as if the first entrance of certain pyrogenous substances into the blood of persons otherwise healthy was especially apt to induce chills, or as if certain infectious materials entering the blood excited particularly intense fever with chills. Hence, although we cannot consider chills a characteristic of pyaemia, still their frequent recur- rence, as well as the generally intermittent type of the fever, is pecu- liar to this disease. Intermittent fever is the only disease in which we see any thing similar ; there we have intermittent attacks of fever with regular intervals ; we do not know on what this interval depends, but I should consider the immediate cause of the attacks of fever to be paroxysmal pouring out of morbid products from the spleen ; in melanasmia and pigment metastases Ave have anatomical evidence that in intermittent fever substances pass from the spleen into the blood; it is known that collections of normal secretion occur in the pancreas and spleen, and are poured out during digestion ; hence, it does not seem to me too bold to assume that, with these physiological evacuations of certain substances from the spleen, pathological prod- ucts may also enter the blood. Thus, in pytemia, from time to time pus or its constituents might be poured into the blood, and under otherwise favorable circumstances fever and chills miglit be induced. Extensive progressive inflammation about the Avound must be re- garded as the chief source of such repeated purulent infection ; destruction of the granulating surface b}â€™' frequent injury, rapid de- struction of the granulations by chemical agents, any new progressiA'e inflammations occurring about the Avound, may open an entrance for the pus into the lymphatic vessels Avhich have been closed; new in- flammation may cause suppuration of the coagula in the lymphatic vessels, and the pus from these may enter the blood; it might also be imagined, although difficult to prove, that in venous thrombosis the central coagula enclosing the pus in the veins are torn loose, and the pus is swept into tlie blood through a passable collateral vein, Avhich opens farther on ; this might be caused by muscular contractions. Lastly, metastatic inflammations, Avhether due to emboli or not, also induce new attacks of fever; but that this is not the only cause is proved by occasional autopsies on cases that have died from intermit- tent purulent fever, after ten or tAvelve chills, Avhere no metastat'o inflammations have been found; the cause of the repeated chills may then lie in the mode of extension of the local process, or be hidden in the bones or elseAvhere. Statistics greatly favor the idea that the chills depend on new inflammations, for they shoAV that the chills (or at least the intermittent fever attacks, Avhich may occur without

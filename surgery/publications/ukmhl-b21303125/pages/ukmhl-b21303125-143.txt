CICATRICES IN MUSCLES AND NERVES. ]]7 taining protoplasm, send out offshoots at the wounded part in which nuclei subsequently form, as is done in the nerves of the tadpole’s tail. This point should be investigated again ; till then we may re- gard wandering cells as the source of the young regenerated tissue. Since /Schwann^s teaching about the development of tissue from cells, we are so convinced that every new tissue proceeds from young cells, that the announcement of independent growth of a perfect tissue without intervention of cells finds little credit; and the increase Fig. 22 a.

After Eicnhovist, of cells by offshoots, with subsequent development of nuclei in these offshoots, is a procedure that histologists have long kept in the background, substituting for it cell-division, although botanists have ascribed a very prominent role to this mode of development in plants. From the latest' published observations we see that the capillary walls, the sxis-cylinder of nerves, and the contents of mus- cular filaments possess this capacity for outgrowth without direct participation of new cells, JRokitansky ascribed to connective tis- sue the capacity for independent outgrowth. Tn the human being the regeneration of nerves only takes place within certain limits, which, it is true, cannot be very accurately de- fined. Tlie complete regeneration of large nerve-trunks, as of the sciatic or median nerves, does not occur; nor does it take place after excision of large ]iortions of nerve, if the ends remain, say three or four lines apart. Very accurate apposition of the ends of the nerve is necessary, for apparently the transformation of the newl3’--formed intermediate substance to nerve-substance can only take place by means of the nerve-stump, although tliere are different opinions about

27G BURNS AND FROST-BITES. than old, to chilblains. Employments requiring frequent change of temperature particularly predispose to them; clerks and apothecaries, who stay for a time in a warm room, then in a cold cellar or ware- house, are frequent subjects. But no station is exempt; people who always wear gloves, and rarely go out in winter, may be attacked as well as those who have never worn gloves. Among females, chlorosis and disturbances of menstruation occasionally seem to predispose to them; generally, frequent returns of frost-bite appear to be connected with some constitutional anomaly. As regards treatment, it is usually very difficult to combat the causes due to constitution and occupation ; hence we are chiefly lim- ited to local remedies. In Italy, where the disease is very frequent, if a cold winter occurs, frictions with snow and ice compresses are â€˜recommended. With us, these are less used, and do no good, or at most only alleviate the itching for a time. Salve of white precipitate of mercury (one drachm to the ounce of lard), frictions with fresh lemon-juice, painting with nitric acid diluted with cinnamon-water (one drachm to four ounces), solution of nitrate of silver (ten grains to the ounce), and tincture of cantharides, are remedies that you may resort to. Sometimes one answers, sometimes another; hand or foot baths with muriatic acid (about one and a half to two ounces to a foot-bath, use for ten minutes), and washing with infusion of mustard-seed, are / also celebrated. If the chilblains open on the top, they may be dressed with ointment of zinc or nitrate of silver (gr. j to 3 j fat). I have here given you only a small number of the remedies recom- mended, the effect of most of which I have myself proved, although there are a number of others; at the commencement of your practice you will find these enough for combating this common, trifling disease.

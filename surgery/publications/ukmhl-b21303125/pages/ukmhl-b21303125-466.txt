440 ULCERS. 2. Fungous ulcers, i. e., tliose whose granulations are fungous and proliferating, and project above the level of the skin. These ulcers secrete a muco-pus, and are very vascular. Fig. 73. Blood-vessels of two luxuriant granulations of a common (not cancerous) ulcer of the leg, arti- ficially injected by Thiersch (Epithelial cancer, Plate XI., Fig. 4). • In these cases we may use astringent remedies and compresses wet with decoction of Peruvian or oak bark, but they are of only moderate benefit. It is best to destroy the surface of such granulations by caus- tics ; daily applications of the solid stick of nitrate of silver usually suffices, where it does not, we may resort to caustic potash or the hot iron. Compression with adhesive plaster is often very efficacious. 3. Callous ulcers are most dreaded by surgeons, on account of the long treatment they require ; they are those whose base, edges, and vicinit}', have become thickened and of cartilaginous hardness, from the long duration of chronic inflammation. The ulcer is torpid, and usually lies deep below the surface; the edges are sharply bounded. The indications for treatment are twofold: first, to soften the tendinous, non-vascular tissue of the hardened borders and liase of the ulcer; and to induce a proper amount of A'ascularity in these parts. We meet ulcers of this variety that have lasted twenty years or more ; in such cases we may employ the following treat- ment : compression, best with strips of adlicsivc plaster ajqilied in a certain way, as you will see done in the clinic. This dressing, which should cover not only the ulcer but the entire leg, may at first be left on a day or two, but later, when the idcer begins to heal, it ma}' re- main untouched for three or four da^’s, or longer.

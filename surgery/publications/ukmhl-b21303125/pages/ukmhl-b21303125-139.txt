113 CHANGES IN CICATEICES. openings made for a seton; they were about the size of a horse- chestnut. They should be carefully removed with the knife, and any subsequent granulations kept in subjection by nitrate of silver. [The translator has seen the above tumors on the lobe of the ear several times; in all but two instances they occurred in mulatto females; in one case the tumor had returned after a previous re- moval.] In the above description of the formation of granulations and cica- trices, for the sake of simplicity we have only referred to the process as it is found in connective tissue, but must now speak of it as it occurs in cicatrization of other tissues. The cicatrix in muscle is at first almost entirely connective tissue; Fig. is. Cicat rix from the upper lip of a clo". a, connective tissue of the cicatrix. The divided muscular flijrea are here atrophied for a short distance, and terminate in a conical shape. Magni- fied 300 diameters. in the ends of the muscular fibres there is at first destruction, then at a certain boundary a collection of nuclei; then there is rounding off of the fibres, sometimes club-shaped, sometimes of more conical form, and the stumps of the muscular fibres unite with the connective tissue of the cicatrix just as they do with the tendons; the muscle cicatrix becomes an inscriptio tendinea. I myself have only observed them in wounds of muscle that had healed by first intention, and have never there seen any thing that I could decide was a new formation of mus- cular tissue. In suppurating ends of muscle, 0. 'Weher has witnessed a slight formation of new muscle; this appears to occur chieHy in for- mation of granulations on muscle and in cei'tain tumors. ^YeUT is of the opinion that young muscular fibres typicalljâ€™- form

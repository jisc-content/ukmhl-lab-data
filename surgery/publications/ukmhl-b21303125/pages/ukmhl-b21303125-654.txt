Not unfrequently the inter- cellular substance, whether hyaline or slightly striated, instead of having the regular firm consistence of normal cartilage, is more gelat- inous or friable, or possibly becomes so secondarily. Calcification of the cartilage, as well as true ossification, is quite frequent in chon- droma; the forms of the cells may vary greatly (Fig. 120). Fia. 120.

In shape, chondromata are usually roundish, nodular, sharply- bounded tumors, which may grow to the size of a manâ€™s head, or larger. At first their growth is almost purely central; subsequently, howev(?r, the tumor enlarges, partly from the occurrence of new foci

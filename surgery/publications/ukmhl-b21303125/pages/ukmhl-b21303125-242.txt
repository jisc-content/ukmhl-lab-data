OPEN FIIACTURES AND SUPPURATION OF BONE, 21G same process requires much longer in the tendons and fascia?, whicii have few vessels, than in the connective tissue, muscles, and skin; in the bone it requires even more time than in the tendons. The con- stitutional power of the individual, and the consequent so-called vitality of the tissues, are also to be taken into consideration. LECTURE XVI.

When a denuded portion of bone begins to throw out granula- tions on its surface (which in complicated fractures we can only see when the ends of the fragments are exposed by a large skin-wound, on the interior surface of the leg, for instance), we recognize this with the naked eye by the following changes: For the first eight or ten days after being denuded of periosteum, the bone mostly preserves its pure yellowish color, which, even during the last day of the above period, changes toward bright rose-color. If we then examine the surface of the bone with a lens, we may notice numbers of veiy fine red points and strias, which a few days later become visible to the naked eye also; these rapidly increase in size, grow in length and breadth, till they unite and then present a perfect granulating surface which passes immediately into the granulations of the surrounding soft parts, and subsequently participates in the cicatrization, so that such a cicatrix adheres firmly to the bone. If we follow this process in its finer histological details, which must be chiefly done experimentally, by aid of injected bones de- prived of their lime, we have the following result: If the circulation in the bone is maintained near to the surface, there is a rich infiltra- tion of cells into the connective tissue accompanying the vessels in the Haversian canals; this tissue grows, with the vascular loops de- veloping toward the surface, out of the bone at the points where the Haversian canals open externally. The development of this young granulation-mass laterally results .at the expense of reabsorbed bone. If we macerate one of tliese bones with superficial granulations, its surface will appear gnawed and i-ough ; in the living bone, gTanulation tissue fills the numerous small holes, which all communicate with the Haversian canals. The surface of the bone does not, however, remain

The insufficient deposit of chalky salts in the growing skeleton in rachitis is accom])anied by unusual development of vessels and unusual absorption of the bony tissue already developed (during the growth of bone there is always a slight amount of absorption at the inner and outer surface of the cortical layer), as well as unusual proliferation of the epijihyseal car- tilages ; if you remember also the young osteophytes forming on the outsides of the hollow bones, it must be acknowledged that tliis dis- turbance of nutrition can scarcely be distinguished from inflamma- tion, even if it passes on to suppuration and caseous degeneration. We often find rachitic synnptoms in scrofulous children, and some physicians regard the disease as one symptom of scrofula ; but this is not quite correct, for in many rachitic children we find no traces of scrofula, among which are especially reckoned tendency to swell- Fig. 91.

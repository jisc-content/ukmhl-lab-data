TUMORS. 622 enormous size, and then not unfrequcnlly calcify. They are usually roundish, and are distinctly and sharply bounded : they are most fre- quent in the body of the organ, rarer in the neck, and hardly ever occur in the vaginal portion; their growth progresses upward and downward, that is, into the abdomen, gradually stretching the perito* iiasum, or through the os uteri into the vagina. In the latter direction the tumors continue to grow, become pedunculated, and often give rise to severe haemorrhages ; they are called Jibrous uterine polypi. Fibromata, starting from the periosteum, are quite frequent; they are almost always fibro-sarcomata, i. e., they are composed of fibres and spindle-shaped cells, the latter may even preponderate (fibrous sarcoma, Rokitansky). The periosteum of the bones of the skull and face is particularly liable to this disease, especially the inferior turbi- nated bone ; from this point fibromata project into the nasal cavities and fauces as polypous growths (fibrous naso-pharyngeal polypi); by pressure they may cause reabsorption of the bone and grow into the cranium or antrum Highmori; they are particularly vascular. I have also seen fibromata on the periosteum of the tibia and clavicle, and in bone itself, as in the upper maxilla, where I have met strange com- binations of chondroma and fibroma. Lastly, we have to mention that fibromata are not rare in and on the nerves (Fig. 118). Frequently all tumors occurring on nerves are called neuromata.^ but they are distin- guished according to their anatomical characteristics ; most neuromata Fic. lie. Ncuroinn, after FdlUi Fio. 119.

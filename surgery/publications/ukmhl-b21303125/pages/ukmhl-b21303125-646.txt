620 TUMORS. sistence, show little connective-tissue but numerous spindle-shaped cells. The significance of these cells is varied. Virchow considers them muscle-cells; hence, what have hitherto been called fibroids of the uterus, he does not class among the fibromata, but among myo- mata, and terms them “ myoma laevicellulare.” If we consider fibre- cells as young connective tissue, we must christen these tumors spindle-celled sarcoma or fibro-sarcoma. You see here, in apparently simple fibrous tissues, we become involved in difficulties with histology and liistogeny. There are two things that would induce me to regarde fibro-cellular tumors as myomata: i. e., the oval and finally rod-like, wavy form of the nuclei, and the very distinct arrangement of the fibrous layers into bundles, Avhile the individual fibre-cells are iso- lated with difficulty, perhaps only by aid of the recognized chemical means. At the same time the soil in which the tumor is developed is very important, the probabilities for a myoma would be very great if the neoplasia occur in the substance of the uterus, Fio. 116.

Par- tial mucous softening, great serous infiltration (brawny appearance and consistence), calcification, and even true ossification, are not very rare. Superficial ulceration is quite frequent in fibromata lying close

708 TUMORS. Cancer of the mucous glands from the interior of the nose. Magnified 200 diameters. flic form of the neoplastic glandular acini be perfectly round, and the interstitial connective tissue be but slightly developed, the hardened, fine sections of such a tumor may very much resemble tissue of the thyroid gland. The interstitial tissue is usually v^ery soft in these tumors; as in the corresponding mucous membranes themselves, it may be almost mucous. Intei'stitial ijapillary proliferations of hyaline vascular connective tissue (cylindroma) also occasionally occur here. These tumors are always very soft, white, medullary, or gelatinous, except when very vascular ; then they are darlc red. The bones are destroyed by caries, without a trace of reactive bony new formation or osteoj^hytes. The appearance and clinical course of these tumors are somewdiat peculiar, differing from other carcinomata. They occuiâ€™ any time after the twentieth year, grow rapidly, and project sometimes through the nares, again through the cheeks or inner canthus of the eye; they are occasionally very sharply bounded or encapsulated, which may be known by palpation, and proved on operation ; some- are so distinct, so normal, that they may be mistaken for normal mu- cous glands; to render this deception complete, it not unfrequently happens that the newly-formed acini secrete mucus, Avhich remains and collects in them. If the secretion from many acini be retained, Fig. 168.

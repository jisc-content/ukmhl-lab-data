TUMORS. G56 llie liver I have seen secondary, very beautifully pigmented, spindle- celled sarcomata; the forms of primary and secondary sarcomata thus vary greatly. Topography of sarcoma. As the above general remarks are in- sufficient for practice, Ave must study more accurately different forms of sarcoma in certain tissues and in certain parts of the body. Sarcomata occur quite often in hollow bones (myeloid tumors or central osteosarcoma), usually in the form of giant-celled sarcoma; they especially attack the lower jaw, next the tibia, radius, and ulna (Figs. 140 to 143). These tumors often contain mucous cysts and spherical or branched osseous formations; they are circumscribed nodules, mostly forming in the medullary cavity, which gradually de- stroy the bone, but in such a way that new bone is constantly devel- oped from the periosteum, so that the tumor, even if very large, often remains covered entirely or partially by a shell of bone ; the diseased Fig. 142.

Section of the specimen shown in Fig. 141. bone then appears puffed up like a bladder, and the tumor does not alwavs cause a complete solution of its continuity. ^Vhen these sar- comata occur in the lower extremity, they become very vascular ; numbers of small traumatic aneurisms develop in them, and a true aneurismal murmur may be heard in them, so that they are often con- sidered and described as true bone-aneurisms. 4 he cystosarcoinatn and compound cysts, Avhich are occasionally seen in bones, especially in the lower jaw, also in large hollow bones, have usually developed from osteosarcomata (Fig. 144). Central osteosarcomata are usually solitary, very rarely generally infectious. In the lower or upper jav they are apt to come at the time of the second dentition, rarely at the first: in the long bones T ha ve only seen them at middle age; of the tumors called epidis (the Avord means located on the gums) a

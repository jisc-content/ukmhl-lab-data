FORMATION OF CALLUS. 199 As previously remarked, the periosteum is used up in the neopla- sia and in ossifying callus, in its place, externally around the callus, a thick connective-tissue layer develops, from which new iDcriosteum is formed. I will show you a few more preparations in explanation Fia. 61. Artificially-injected external callus, of slight thickness, on the surface of a rabhit’s tihia, in the vicinity of a five-day-old fracture. Longitudinal section—a, caiius ; 6, bone.

You see (Fig. 51) the peculiar course of the vessels almost at right angles to the bone, which enter the bone through the young callus. The ossification of the callus begins, mantle-like, around these vessels, and the little columns which first appear in the external callus are thus formed (see remarks on Fig. 44). You have a good representation of the formation of external (periosteal) and internal (endosteal) callus in the following (incomplete) transverse sec- tion of the tibia of a dog, from the immediate vicinity of an eight-day- old fracture, in which you must also observe the vessels of the cortical sub- stance, which are considerably dilated as compared with normal (Fig. 52). Lastly, observe the following prepa- ration. It is an eight-day-old, already ossified, extern.al callus on the surface of the tibia of a, dog, magnified 250 times (Fig. 53). If we now view the lorocess as a whole, we see that the cell infiltra- tion in the bone itself, as well as in all the surrounding parts, aids in the formation of callus, and that hence the periosteum plays no ex- clusive osteoplastic role. This might have been concluded a priori^ Artlflcinny-injected transverse section of tlio tibia of a dog, from the immedi- ate vicinity of an eight-day-old frac- ture. a, internal callus; 6, external; cc, cortical layer of the bone.

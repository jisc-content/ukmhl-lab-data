115 CICATRICES IN MUSCLES AND NERVES. tion tlirougli the cicatrix. In large superficial cicatrices, new nerves develop ; when you have excised portions of skin and have brought to- gether and united parts lying at a distance, new nerves grow through tlie cicatrix and perfect power of conduction comes after a time, as may be often observed in plastic operations. These facts are very Fig. 20.

Just think how wonderful that these nerve-filaments, sensory and motor, should find each other in the new adhesion, and that even, as we must suppose, the stumps of the primitive fibres should unite as they had been united, so that correct conduction and localization might result as they actually do ! We cannot here go more exactly into this sub- ject. I will only mention that the more minute process, which has been very carefully followed by ScJdJf, Jljelt, and others, is generally as follows: first, in the stump of the nerve there is a destruction of tlie nerve-sheath, possibly also of the axis cj'liuder to a certain extent; at the same time in the neurilemma there is a collection of cells, which proceeds to the development of spindle-shaped cells in the sub- stance lying between the ends of the nerve, and extending into the

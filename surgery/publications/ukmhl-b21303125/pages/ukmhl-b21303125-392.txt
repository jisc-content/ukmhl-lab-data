366 TRAUMATIC AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES, ETC. the ferment absorbed into the blood acted very slowly, in another very quickly; nothing definite can be said on this point. As I for- merly believed that the fever was always caused by nervous irritation, it was necessary to suppose that this nritability was varied, and hence the febrile effect might occur at very different periods, but I have en- tirely abandoned this theory, without undervaluing the important part played by the nervous system in the origin and symptoms of fever. Traumatic fever usually lasts a week ; it is rarely longer, without some visible local complication. When there is an accidental inflammation of the cellular tissue, lymphatic vessels, or veins, about a wound, fever occms simultaneously with this inflammation, or apparently precedes it (coming as an in- flammatory secondary fever, either immediately after the traumatic fever or when several or even many days have passed without fever). I say it apparently precedes, because the first signs of the local affec- tion may have escaped us, as they may possibly have presented no sensible symjjtoms, or because the poisonous material may have in- fected the blood sooner than it did the parts immediately around; the probability of the latter idea is based on the fact that poison, taken into the lymphatic vessels or veins with the lymph or blood, flows more rapidly in the centre of the vessel than along its walls, and thus quickly reaches the large blood-vessels, while the fluid, moving more slowly along the walls of the vessels, only gradually passes into the perivas- cular tissue, and there induces inflammation by the phlogogenous poi- son it contains; thus fever (the blood-infection) may appear before erysipelas, lymphangitis, or phlebitis (from the local infection), is per- ceived. The course of this secondary fever entirely depends on that of the local inflammation; as the latter begins, the temperature rises rapidly, often with an initial chill. The longer these secondary fevers continue, that is, the longer the poison is kept up, the more danger- ous the condition becomes; rapid emaciation, great sweating, sleep lessness, and continued loss of appetite, are bad symptoms ; usually in these secondary fevers there is absorption of pus or infection from without. Pronounced erysipelas or inflammation of the lymphatic ressels or glands are the relatively most favorable forms of the acci- dental inflammations, as sooner or later they generally lead to a certain usually favorable termination, and thus are some'what typical in their course, although the duration of an erysipelas may vary from three flays to three weeks or more, and prove very debilit.ating ; at first the fever-curve rises rapidly, then remains lor a time at a certain height, usually with morning remissions ; not unfrequently the temperature falls rapidly ; the same is true of lymphangitis. Fortunately, it is rare for lymphangitis and erysipelas to extend deep into the cellular tis- sue and under the fasciae; in such a case the disease would be classed

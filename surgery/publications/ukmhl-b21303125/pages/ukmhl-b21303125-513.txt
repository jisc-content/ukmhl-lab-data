487 DETACHMENT OF THE SEQUESTRUM. loose in the epiphysis cartilage, presses strongly against the skin from within and gradually perforates it, so tliat it appears externally; the lower epiphysis of the femur was at the same time drawn up by the muscles, so that the appearance was as follows (see Fig. 85). The sequestrum, subsequently removed, had the following form (Fig. 86) : Fio. 8C. The body extracted from Fig. 85. The formation of bone was strong enough to carry the body; sul>Â» sequently, under chloroform, the knee was straightened, and perfect recovery resulted. I saw a perfectly similar case affecting the lower end of the humerus. In both cases, as is usual in necrosis near the joints, the joint had suffered severely, and became quite stiff'. Still, even without early detachment of the sequestrum from softening of the epiphyseal cartilages, under circumstances which we do not accu- rately know, the formation of bone may be very feeble, so that, after the detachment, the new bone is not firm at some point, but is quite flexible, whereby we have a pseudarthrosis of the new bone; I have seen two cases of this Idnd : one of these I cured eompletely by occa- sionally driving ivory plugs into the weak part of the newly-formed bone, thus constantly stimulating the bone to new production; the object was attained in the course of eight months, and the patient, then twelve years old, now walks like a healthy person.

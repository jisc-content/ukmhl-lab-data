PLASTIC INFILTRATION. 59 almost entirely of cells, held together by a very slight quantity of gelatinous intermediate substance (which subsequently becomes firmer and finally fibrous). In the sketch below (Fig. 3), a sequel to the above diagram, you Fig. 3. Diagram representing the surface of the wound united hy inflammatory new formation, o, plastic infiltration of tissue. Magnified 30U-40'J. see a section of the wound now united by newly-formed tissue, which once for all we shall tenn inflammatory neio formation or cellular tissue. Virchoio calls it granulation tissue, JRindfleisch germ- tissue. The inflammatory new formation results from an earlier state in which the still filamentary connective tissue is infiltrated with innu- merable wandering cells, a state which may readily return to the nor- mal by atrophy of these cells. This stage of cellular or 2â€™>lastic infiltra- tion., in which the tissue feels firmer than in watery edematous infiltra- tion, is almost always at some distance from the edge of the wound, 80 that in any such specimen of a recent wound we may follow the development of the inflammatory new formation from the plastic (cellular) infiltration, if we make microscopical examinations from the

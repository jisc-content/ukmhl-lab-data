The periosteum and the bones are physiologically so intimately connected that disease of one generally affects the other; although, in spite of this, we are, for practical reasons, obliged to consider acute and chronic inflammation of the periosteum and of bone separately, still we shall often have to refer to their connection. I must here make a few preliminary anatomical remarks, as they are important for the comprehension of the following process : When spealving briefly of the periosteum, we usually mean, simply, the white, glistening, thin membrane, poor in vessels, which immediately surrounds the bone. I must here remark that this represents only a part of the periosteum that is pathologically of little relative importance. Upon this just described inner layer of the periosteum lies, at points where no ten dons or ligaments are inserted, a layer of loose cellular tissue, which is also to be considered as periosteum, and in which princijially lie the vessels that enter the bone. This outer layer of periosteum is the most frequent seat of primary inflammations, either acute or chronic; the loose cellular tissue of which this layer consists is very rich iu cells and vessels, hence more inclined to inflammation than is the ten- dinous portion, poor in cells and vessels, which lies immediately oil the bone. As to nutrient vessels, especially in the long bones, the epiphyses have their own supply, which, as long as the epiphyseal car-

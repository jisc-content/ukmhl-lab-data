SIMPLE FRACTURES OF BOXES. 194 together. The larger the circle of irritation from the dislocated frag- ments, the more extensive the formative reaction. In man we most frequently have the opportunity of seeing callus formation in greatly dislocated fractures of the clavicle, where it is very evident that the extent of the new formation of bony substance is directly proportional to the amount of dislocation. You may read- ily understand how, in this way, Avith extensive formation of neo- plastic bone-substance, there may be perfect firmness, even Avith great deformity at the point of fracture. Still, one Avould hardly believe, Avithout satisfying himself on the point, from preparations, that Avith time, even in such cases, Nature has the power of restoring, not only the outward shape of the bone (except the curvature and rotation), but also the medullary cavity, by reabsorption and condensation. Fig. 46. Fig. 41. Old united oblique fracture of a human til)in; the ends of the fmgmcuts have l>eeD rounded off by absorption, the e.xterniil callus reabsorbed ; formation of the me- dullary cavity incomplete. Size dimiu- ished. Guiâ€™lt, 1. c., p. iJ87. Numbers of points, nodules, inequalities and roughnesses of all sorts, that are formed on the young callus in recent cases, so disapjjear in the course of months and years, that in their place there is only left some dense, compact, cortical substance. Fracture cf the tibia of a rabbit, with great dislocation, with extensive rorinalion of callus, after 27 days. Natural size, after Skutsch. {Ourlt's Fractures, vol. i., p. 270.)

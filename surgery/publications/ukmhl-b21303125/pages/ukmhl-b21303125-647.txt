FIBROMATA. 621 under a mucous membrane; it results from external injuries in the usual way. The ulcer, thus formed, often shows good granulations and suppuration, and, under favorable circumstances, it may be brought to cicatrize. Fibrous tissue, though apparently poor in vessels, often contains quite a number, both of arteries and veins, as may be shown by injections ; occasionally a very coarse cavernous net-work of veins forms in it (see Fig. 117) ; arteries and veins are so intimately united with the tissue of the tumor, that their adventitia mostly disappears in it, so that, in case they are injured, they cannot retract either trans- versely or longitudinally, and they remain gaping. This is the ana- Fig. IIT. a b a and ft, vessels of a cutis fibroma (myoma?) from the thigh, injected through an artery ; ft, cav- ernous veins: c, peciiiiar regularly-arranged veins of a cutis-fibroma (myo-fibroma f) of the abdominal walls, injected”through a vein.

The rigid gaping opening of the vessel renders the formation of a thrombus very difficult. Occasionally, in large uterine and in periosteal fibro- mata, wo find lacunar fissures filled with thin serum; fiossibly these are ectatic pathological newly-formed lymph sinuses; there are no certain observations on this point. Cavities, as large as the head filled with serum, also occur in uterine fibromata {Spencer Wells). The localization of fibroma varies greatly; of all the organs the uterus is most frequently allectod (if under the general term “ fibroid” we include myo-fibroma) ; here these tumors occasionallv attain an 41

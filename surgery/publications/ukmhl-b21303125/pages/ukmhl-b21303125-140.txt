SIMPLE INCISED WOUNDS OF THE SOFT PARTS. 114 from the cells of old ones, but considers it impossible to prove that no muscular cells originate from other young cells. As a result of his examination of old muscular cicatrices, he also maintains that the re- generation continues a long time, and in most cases is more complete than is generally supposed. MaslowsJcy has affirmed the metamor- Fia. 19. Ends of divided miiscnlav fibres from the biceps muscle of a rabbit eight days after the injury; ab c, old muscular fibres; a, the contractile substance rolled up and balled together; the same way in the bundle above d; the same with the sarcolemraa drawn out to a point; c, into the pointed cornet-shaped sarcolemma tube extendsa series of young muscular nuclei, between which there is very delicate transversly striated substance; e, the same with young, free muscle-cells; /, two young ribbon-like muscular filaments; the same of vari- ous size isolated.

[Cin- nabar or vermilion injected into the blood is taken up by white cor- puscles, and may afterward be discovered on inflamed tissue.] Ghissenbauer has shown that, after injury, the muscular filaments usually break down into flakes, and then new young muscle-cells form, after the type of embryonal development, from the cells con- tained in the old muscle-filaments; the amount of the new fonnation depends on the quality and duration of the irritation. If a nerve be divided, its ends separate, from their elasticity, they swell slightly, and subsequently unite by development of a now forma- tion of true nerve-tissue, so that the nerve is again cajjable of conduc-

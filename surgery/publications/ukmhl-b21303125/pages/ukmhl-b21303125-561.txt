In the hip, these ground surfaces are at the upper surface of the head of the femur, and in the acetabulum; in the knee, they are on the condyles, etc. In these changes the neck of the femur may be cov- ered with osteophytes in some places, while induration goes on at the smooth surfaces. Tlie neck of the femur may be surrounded by osteo- phytes, and thus acquire a characteristic shape. This will sometimes

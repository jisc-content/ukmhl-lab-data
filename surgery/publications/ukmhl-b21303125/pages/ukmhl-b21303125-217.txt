191 FORMATION OF CALLUS. the fracture, and, while it is firmly held in a vice, saw the bone longi* tudinally, you find the following : the soft parts about the fracture are swollen and elastic; the muscles and subcutaneous cellular tissue loolc fatty; the swollen soft parts form a spindle-shaped, not very thick tumor about the seat of fractiu’e. About the broken ends we find some dark extravasated blood, and the medullary cavity at the same point is somewhat infiltrated with blood. The amount of this escaped blood varies, being sometimes very slight, again considerable. At the point of fracture the periosteum may be readily recognized, and is in- timately connected with the other swollen soft parts (which are the seat of plastic infiltration). Occasionally it is somewhat detached from the bone at the point of fracture. The whole thing looks about as follows (Fig. 43): Fig. 44. Fio. 43.

Dintiram of a longitudinal section of a lilteen-dfiy-old fracture of a longbone ; (I, internal callus ; b, inner, c, outer layer of ossifleation of the external callus; a, new periosteum. The di- mensions of the callus, in proportion to the entire lack of dislocation of the fragments, are represented as far too great, but lliis facilitates the pre- liminary understanding of the case. If we now examine a fracture in a rabbit after ten or twelve days, we find that tlie extravasation has either entirely disappeared, or that only a slight amount remains. I will not raise the question as to whether it has been entirely reabsorbed, or has partly organized to callus. The spindle-shaped swelling of the soft parts has mostly the appearance and consistence of cartilage, and has also the same micro- scopical characteristics; in the medullary cavity also we find jmumr

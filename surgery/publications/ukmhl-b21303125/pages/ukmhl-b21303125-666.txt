G40 TUMORS. {b.) Cavernous angiomata^ or cavernous venous tumors. We will first determine their anatomy, so that you may at once correctly note their difference from plexiform angiomata. Extirpated cavernous angiomata may at once be recognized, on section, by having almost exactly the formation of the corpus cavernosum penis. You see a white, firm, tough net-work, which appears empty, or at least con- tains only in spots red or discolored coagula, or possibly is filled with small, round, chalky concrements, so-called vein-stones ; but we must imagine the mesh-work as distended with blood previous to its extir- pation. The boundary of this cavernous tissue, which may form in all the tissues of the bod}'', is sometimes evidently a sort of capsule; but in other cases this cavernous degeneration is very indistinctly bounded, and at different spots, in a rather indifferent manner, it enters the tissue. Microscopic examination of this mesh-work, which is formed sometimes of thin threads, sometimes of membrane-like capsules, shows that the branches are formed of remains of the tissue in which Fio. 129.

The inner wall of the space filled with blood is, in most cases, coated with spindle-shaped cells (venous endo- thelium), so that even these anatomical conditions go to prove that we have to deal chiefly with distended veins. Hie mode of development of this peculiar tissue has received different explanations. If wc had anv accurate investigations about the dev elojnnent of

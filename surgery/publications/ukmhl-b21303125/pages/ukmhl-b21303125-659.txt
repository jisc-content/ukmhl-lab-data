OSTEOMATA. 633 (Fig. 124). On their roundish, nodular surface, tliere is a layer of beautifully-developed hyaliiie cartilage, about a line or a line and a half thick, which evidently grows partly in itself, partly peripherally from the periosteum or perichondrium, then rapidly, ossifies toward the centre. The newly-formed bony mass itself is, from its start, most Fia. 124. Pednncnlated spongy exostosis from tho lower end of the femur, after Fean. intimately connected with the spongy substance of the epiphyses, so that the hard tumor is immovably seated on the bone. From the na- ture of these exostoses they can only occur in young persons. Ac- cording to my observation, tibia, fibula, and humerus, are their mosl frequent scat. {b.) Ivory exostoses. These consist of compact bony substance, with Haversian canals and lamellar systems; they develop on the bones of the face and skull (Figs. 125 and 12G), on the pelvis, scapula, grei t toe, etc., and form roundish, nodulated, or smooth tumors.

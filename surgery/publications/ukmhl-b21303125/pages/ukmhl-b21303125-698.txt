TUMORS. G72 tion of these tumors to the gland, we find that there are diffuse swell ings of the gland, affecting one or both lobes, and others that arc dis- tinctly bounded in the gland, the latter remaining normal or but slightly hypertrophic. If we exclude simple cysts of the thyroid, so- called struma cystica, most other forms of goitre are pure adenoma or cysto-adenoma. If the tissue of these tumors, which may vary greatly in consistence, be not metamorphosed by secondary changes, on section it appears to the naked eye almost the same as the cut surface of a normal thyroid gland. Microscopically also it is very much the same; almost all thyroid tumors on microscopic examination show a large amount of connective-tissue capsules, which contain a clear gelatinous substance filled with more or less round pale cells (Fig. 151).

One of the most frequent changes in goitre-tumors is the formation of cysts, which come from a number of the dilating gland-vesicles uniting, and their thick gelatinous contents becoming fluid. But, besides this formation of cysts in goitres, there are other just as frequent changes that occur almost regularly if the goitre e.xists a long time: these are extravasations of blood, which are mostly reabsorbed, but leave more or less pigmentation. Caseous and fatty degeneration is also frequent in old goitres; lastly, calcareous degeneration often occurs, so that by these secondary changes the original picture of the tumor may be much altered.

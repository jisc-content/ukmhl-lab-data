PREPARATIONS SHOWING HEALING OF WOUNDS. 85 T}ie preparation lias been treated with acetic acid, to show the ai^ rangement of the connective-tissue cells, that have lonned from the granulation tissue; a a a axe partly obliterated, partly still permeable blood-vessels; the connective-tissue cells are still relatively large, suc- culent, and distinctly spindle-shaped, still the intercellular substance is richly developed. To study the state of the blood-vessels in the wound, we must make injections; this is quite difficult, and quick success often depends on a lucky chance. Fig. 13. On this subject we have the recent Avorks of ^Vylcodzoff and Thiersch, whose results in the main agree partly witli one another, partly Avith my investigations on this subject. Wywodzoff, Avho op- erated on dogs’ tongues, gives a series of representations of tlie con- llorizoiital section tlirongh the tontnie of a dog, near the Burface, made with a broad knili*. Frontal section through the tongue after in.iection and hardening, I'ortj'-eight hours after tlie injury. Magnilied 70^0 diameters ; after iVywodzoff—a a, intermediate sultstance between tlie edges of tlie wound (consisting of fllamentnry-looking adhesive material and oxtrava- sated blood). The section has passed through two layers of inuscle crossing each other. Looping of the vessels with dilatation in both borders of the wound ; commencing elonga- tion of the loops into the connective substance.

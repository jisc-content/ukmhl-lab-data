Causes, Different Varieties of Fractures.—Symptoms, Diagnosis.—Course and External Symptoms.—Anatomy of Healing, Formation of Callus.—Source of the Inflamma- tory Osseous Now Formation.—Histology. Gentlemen: Hitherto we have been exclusively occupied with injuries of the soft parts ; it is time to consider the bones. You will (ind that the processes that Nature excites for the restoration of the parts are essentially the same that you already know; but the circum- stances are more complicated, and can only be fully understood when you are perfectly acquainted with the mode of healing in the soft parts. Every pei’son knows that bones maybe broken, and again be.' firmly united; this can only be done by bony tissue, as you will at once see; hence it follows that new bony substance must be formed; the cicatrix in bone is usually bone ; a very important fact, for, if this were not the case, if the broken ends only grew together by connec- tive tissue, as divided muscles do, the long bones particularly would not be united firmly enough to support the body, and after the sim- plest fractures many men would be cripples for life. Still, before fol- lowing the process of the healing of bones to its more minute details, a study that has always been pursued with great zeal by surgeons, I must tell you something about the origin and symptoms of simple fractures; I say “ simple or subcutaneous fractures ” in contradistinc- tion to those accompanied by wounds of the soft parts. Man may even come into the world with broken bones: the bones of the foetus may be broken, while in the uterus, by abnormal con- tractions of that organ, or by blows or kicks on the pregnant abdomen, and such intra-utcrine fractures generally heal with considerable dislo- cation ; as we shall see in other instances, the vis medicatrix natunv

POLYARTICULAR CHRONIC RHEUMATISM. 537 of the bony growth we may often tell the course of its formation. These periarticular bony formations may cause entire dislocation of the joint and force it into an abnormal, half-luxated position ; they Fio. 100. Fio. 101.

Sometimes these osseous formations grow into the joint, loosen from their attachments, and become loose bodies in the joint; of which we shall speak hereafter. Lastly, chronic dropsy may accompany this affection also, and you may readily understand that, from all these concurring circumstances, the joint may become so deformed as justly to deserve the name “ arthritis deformans.” But, I again repeat, that all these pathologi- cal changes never lead to suppuration. We now come to the clinical appearance of this peculiar disease. According to my experience, I should distinguish three forms of the disease : one, which is usually polyarticular and accompanied by con- traction of the muscles; a second, which comes in one joint in young and middle-aged persons; and a third, Avhich only occurs in old age. 1. Polyarticular chronic rheumatism (arthrite seche, rheumatis- mus nodosLis, rheumatic gout) attacks young or middle-aged persons ; it is more frequent in women than in men, and in poor than in rich people; badly-nourished, anaemic persons are especially liable to it;

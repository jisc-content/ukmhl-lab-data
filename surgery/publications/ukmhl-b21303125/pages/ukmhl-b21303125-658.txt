TUMORS. G32 we have already remarked when speaking of chondroma. But the name osteoma is usually limited to tumors consisting entirely of bone. [ may mention here that not only new formations of entire teeth Fio. J23. Section of an odontoma. ]ilagnified 100 diameters. (very irregularly shaped) occur in ovarian cysts and in the antrum Highmori, but that on the teeth themselves outgrowths of true ivory matter, ivory exostoses (odontoma of Virchow) have been observed; but these are very rare, and may be regarded merely as curiosities. Exostoses consist partly of spongy bone-substance, like that in the medullary cavity of bones, partly of ivory-like substance, like that in the regular lamellae of the cortical substance of the hollow bones; hence we shall distinguish spongy exostoses and ivory exostoses. A third form of osteomata is formed by the ossification of tendons, fas- ciae, and muscles, whose right to be classed among tumors is, how- ever, doubtful. (a.) (Spongy exostoses^ with cartilaginous covering (exostosis car- tilagina?). These tumors occur almost exclusively on the epiph^'^es of the long bones ; they are outgrowths from the epiphyseal cartilages, whence Virchow very properly calls them â€œ Ecchondrosis ossificans'"

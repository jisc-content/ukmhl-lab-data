CIRCULATION AFTER LIGATION. 127 nhvays striving, by most carefully operating and attending to tbe wound, to attain healing by the first intention. But it was the suc- cess of acupressure which first showed clearly that the adhesion of the tissues by coagulable exudation even in forty-eight hours is enough to keep securely the compressed or twisted artery, even when it is the size of the femoral. Although Kocher has shown that, even after acupressure, thrombi occur in arteries, yet they are too small to check bleeding in a large artery within forty-eight hours. Hence, even from this point of view, attempts to replace the ligature by other methods, which leave no threads in the wound but permit its entire closure by first intention, should be encouraged without denying in any way the extraordinary advantages of the ligature. Let us now look at the fate of the circulation after ligating a large artery in the continuity. Suppose that, for a htemorrhage in the leg, the femoral artery has been ligated; how does the blood now reach the leg ? how will the circulation go on ? Just as on closure of capil- lary districts, under increased pressure, the blood presses through the next permeable vessels, which are thereby dilated; the same thing occurs on closure of small or medium-sized arteries. Under increased pressure, the blood flows through the branches close above the thrombus, and fi’om the numerous arterial anastomoses, both in the Pia. 32.

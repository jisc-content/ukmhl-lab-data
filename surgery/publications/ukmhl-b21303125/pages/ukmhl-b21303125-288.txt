202 GUNSHOT-WOUNDS. Fig. 59. gunshot-wounds which are treated on the same general principles as contused wounds. In these, as in other wounds, the first thing is to arrest any arterial hasmorrhage. This is to be done according to the rules already given, the bleeding artery being tied either in the wound itself, or the corresponding arterial trunk being ligated in its continuitj^; to accomplish the former, it is generally necessary to enlarge the opening of entrance or exit, otherwise we should not find the bleed- ing artery. If there be no haemorrhage, Ave should examine the wound, especially any blind canal, for foreign bodies, par- ticularly for the bullet. This may be done most certainly with the finger; should it not be long enough, or should the canal be too narroAV, we may best use a silver female catheter, with which we may feel more certainly and safely than Avith a probe ; if we feel the bullet, Ave try to remove it the shortest Avay, that is, either clraAV it out at the point of entrance, or, if it lies in a blind canal, close under the skin, Ave make an inci- sion through the skin and extract it through this, thereby changing the blind canal into a complete one. The extrac- tion of bullets through the opening of entrance may be made by aid of spoon or forceps-shaped instruments. Bullet- forceps Avith long, thin blades are often difficult to use, because they cannot be sufficiently opened in the narrow canal â€¢ to seize the bullet, hence many military surgeons prefer tlie spoon-shaped instra- ment. Suclr a bullet scooj) has lately been suggested by S. v. Langenhech^ and seems very jiractical ; in it the spoon is movaljle so as to pass behind the bullet, and push it Ibrw'ard. Still better, it seems to me, is a recently-invented American forceps, AAdiose peculiarity is that thcA can be opened even in a narroAV canal, and they seize A'ery securely. If the bullet be lodged in a bone, Ave may bore a long gimlet into it,

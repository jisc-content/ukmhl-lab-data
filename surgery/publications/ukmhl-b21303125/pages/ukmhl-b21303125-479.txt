If you saw or cut out a piece from a carioua apot, and abstract the chalky salts from the bone by cbromic acidi, and U»en make sections through it and ch*ar them with glycerine, you will hare about the following picture (Fig, 75) ; Pio. ta Section of a piece of carlona Done (nrlm IDdcomi.

What becomes of the cells that were in them, we can lianlly say; they can no longer lie recogniaxl among the numerous young cells of the inflammatory new formation among which they enter ; it is possible tliat, frewl from their eag»', they aid in increasing the cell-brood by sulxlividing, jxissibly they die ; at all eventa, as far us may Ixj judged by the change of form, they do not aid in diesolviug

CHAPTER IV. CONTUSED AND LACERATED WOUNDS OF THE SOFT PARTS, LECTURE XII. Moilc of Occiiri-cnee of tliesc Wounds ; tlieir Appearance.—Slight Ilicinorrliago in Con. fused Wounds.—Early Secondary llaunorrliages.—Gangrene of the Edges of the Wound.—Influences that effect the Slower or inore 'Kapid Detachment of the Dead Tissue.—Indications for Primary Amputation.—Local Complications in Contused Wounds; Decomposition, Putrefaction, Septic Inflammations.—Contusion of Ar- teries ; Late Secondary Haemorrhages. The causes of contused wounds, of wliicb we have to treat to-day, are the same as those of simple contusions, only in the first cases the force is usually greater than in the latter, or the body by which they are induced is of such a form as to divide the skin and soft parts easily, or else parts of the body have been injured where the skin is particularly thin, or lies over parts unusually firm. The kick of a horse, blow from a stick, bite of an animal or a man, being run over, wounding with blunt knives, saws, etc., are frequent causes of contused wounds. Nothing, however, causes more contused wounds than rapidly-moving wheels and rollers of machineiy, cutting- machines, circular-saws, spinning-jennies, and the various machines with cog-wheels and hooks. All of these instruments, the product of advancing industrj^ do much injury among llie operatives. Men and women, adults and children, with cruslied lingers, maslicd hands, ragged, lacerated wounds of the forearm and arm, arc now among the constant patients in tlie surgical wards of hosjiitals in every large city. Innumerable persons are thus maimed of fingers, hands, or arms, and many of these jiatients die as a result of tlieir injuries. If to these you add (what recently is becoming rarer, it is true) railroad injuries, those caused by blasting, building tunnels, etc., you may

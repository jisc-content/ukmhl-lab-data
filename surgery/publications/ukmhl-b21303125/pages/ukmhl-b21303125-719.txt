Not long since, I saw an epithelial carcinoma on the right forearm, which had developed from a fontanel, kept up for ten years with peas. I also saw an ulcer of the foot, which, after lasting for years, without any known cause became cancerous. (d.) We also mention here the carcinomata growing from the vesical mucous membrane, which also has a pavement epithelium. Inaccessible as it is for surgical treatment, the surgeon must still be well acquainted with it, to enable him to make a differential diagn,osis. It has already been frequently mentioned that papillary proliferations occur in carcinoma; this is particularl3>- often the case in cancers on the inner surface of the bladder, which frequently grow in the shape of branched villi, and have consequently received the special name of “ villous cancer.” Cancers starting from the cutaneous epithelium and glands have the same relation to villous cancer that adenoma has to papilloma.

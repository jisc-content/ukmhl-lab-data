ORGANIC FERMENTS IN WOUNDS. 103 isms, wliosG si^’nificaiice is at present so much discussed, I will here o-iveVou a brief sketch of those forms that are most frequently found in decomposing’ tissues and fluids, T.hey may be iiiinute spheres (micrococcus, from [j,iKpbg, small, and 6 itoicnog, the germ), or minute rods (bacteria, from to jSaitTnpLOV, the rod), which may be isolated, in pairs, or in chains of from 4 to 20 links (streptococcus, from 6 arpe-rog, the chain, and 6 KOKKog) ; often they are held in the shape of a sphere or cylinder by a glutinous substance which they throw o’ut (coccoglia, from icoicKog and 77 yUa or yXotd, glue). Fig. 17 a. These elements vary greatly in size, from a ]iale sphere, of such diameter that it can scarcely be perceived ivith the highest power of a microscope, to the size of a pus-cell ; they are sometimes mova- ble, at others quiet. It is pretty generally agreed that these minute organisms are vegetable in their nat’ure, and belong to the algae; but their accurate botanical position and relations to each other are still matters of dispute ; their development is not yet explained, and until very recently some believed that they wei’e the result of f/eneratio mquivoca or ahiofienesis, that is, existed without influence from any living organism. From my investigations, T think that all the above forms belong to one plant, which, being composed of coc- cus and bacteria, and being found chiefly in decomposing fluids, I have, called Coccobacteria septica. This plaTit seems to me to de- velop as follows : first, its germs are found in dry air, and maj’ be

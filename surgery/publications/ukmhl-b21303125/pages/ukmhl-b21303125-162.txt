SOME PECULIARITIES OF PUNCTURED WOUNDS. 136 about among them as long as the pressure of the blood is stronger than the resistance of the tissues; a cavity filled with blood is formed in immediate communication with the calibre of the artery, part of the blood soon coagulates, and there is slight inflammation of the tissue about it; a plastic infiltra- ^ tration, which leads to con- nective tissue new forma- tion, and this thickened tissue forms a sac, into and from whose cavity the blood flows, while the pe- riphery of the cavity is filled with layers of clotted blood. The buzzing and friction that Ave perceive in the tumor arise partly from the blood flowing out through the narrow open- ing in the artery, partly by its friction against the coagulum, and lastly by the regurgitation of the blood into the artery. Such a traumatic an- eurism may also occur in another, more secondary way ; the arterial Avound at first heals, and subse- quently, after removal of the pressure bandage, the young cicatrix gives Avay, Anenrisma iranmaticnm of the brachial artery; after and then for the first time AYo/'fey;, “ Surgical Copperplates.” Bd.

Thus, in his surgical lectures, A. Cooper tells of a gentleman avIio leaped a ditch while out shooting, and at the time felt a pain in the holloAV of his knee, Avhich prevented his Avallting. An aneurism of the popliteal artery soon.developed in the bend of the knee, that finally had to be operated on. The artery Avas partly ruptured by the leap. Rupture of the tunica intima and muscularis is ’sufficient to permit the forma- tion of an aneurism. Should the tunica adventitia remain uninjured,

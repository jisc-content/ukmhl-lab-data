In diffuse, deep inflamm.ntion of the cellular tissue, with or without venous thrombosis, the fever does not begin so suddenly, but, from the first, always has a decidedly remittent type, and, like the local affec- tions, is incomputable in its further course; the loss of strength, the I’m. 70. emaciation, sweating, sensitiveness, and excitability of the patient, attain the highest grade. Intermittent fever and metastatic inflam- mations, the chief sj^mptoms of those malignant traumatic fevers which we call “ pyaemia,” are greatly to be feared in such cases. In all these fevers the quantity of urea is increased and exceeds the amount of nitrogenous food consumed; at the same time, accord- ing to recent investigations, the weight of the body diminishes con- siderably. As long as the constitutional symptoms, especially those due to Ihc fever, do not extend beyond the above, and especially if the dis- ease does not prove fatal, we are generally satisfied with the terms “ traumatic, suppurative, or secondary fever.” But, if other symptoms occur, and death results, tliese severer infections have two other names, septicaemia” and “pyemia.” Wa follow this common classi- fication.

OSTITIS MALACISSANS. 459 affection the bones become very light, and the cortical substance very thin. Rindfleisch has shown how the atrophy occurs in sucb cases; for he discovered that the chalky salts were first dissolved and disap- peared as in lacunar corrosion. But while in the latter case the osseous tissue disappeared with the chalky salts, in the present case the tissue continues to exist for a time; the cases where every trace Fig. T5 a. Ostitis malacissans : Â«, vertical section of the calcaneus, diseased anteriorly and posteriorly, normal in the middle; b, vertical section of the upper end of tho tibia, quite porous. of bone inside the periosteum has disappeared in this way, show that the osseous tissue which has lost its salts is finally absorbed itself. But whether this is always the case, or whether it may again be im- pregnated with chalky salts and again become normal bone, is not known. Whether this variety of atrophy, which may correctly be termed halisteresis ossium (from salt, and OTt:pr](JLg, robbing, JCilian), always runs the course shown in Fig. 7G, is not fully inves- tigated ; possibly the chalky salts and the tissue might be absorbed at the same time. The fact that there is no sign of proliferation in the bone corpuscles of the tissue clejirived of its chalky salts seems to prove that they arc not disposed to proliferate. So we have here a form of inflammation of bone in which its atrophy is a particularly prominent feature, and there is a very scanty formation of osteophytes, or this may bo altogether absent. In the bone there is no regenerative process; the medulla, which is

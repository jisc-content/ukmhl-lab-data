These peculiar hyaline clubs and cylinders were formerly regarded as lymphatic vessels. I recognized this error early, and took them for hyaline connective tissue, and from the hyaline cylinders called the tumor “ cylindroma.” But their commencement remained obscure ; the cylinders, composed wholly or chiefly of cells, I took for glandular Fig. 139 e. From a cylindroma (plexiform sarcoma with hyaline vegetations) of the orbit. Magnified 800. formations; hence the mode of development of these new forma- tions remained doubtful for myself and some other observers, who had the opportunity of examining such tumors. Later I wavered a good deal over the significance of these things and their genetic combinations. Sattler's investig'ations first threw a clear liglit on the subject. The explanation just given seems to me the more probable, as it gives the key for explaining many varieties of these tumors. 34.—P. 664. Quite lately the investigations of liizzozero and Neumann have shown an intimate relation between leucocythemia and disease of medulla of the bones, where according to the views of these ob- servers the transformation of colorless into red blood-cells should normally take place; so that leucocythemiji would be due to this transformation being prevented from any cause.

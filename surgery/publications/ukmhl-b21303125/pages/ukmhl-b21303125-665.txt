ANGIOMATA. 039 the naked eye. The reason for the color of these tumors being some- times blood-red, sometimes pale bluish, is that, in the former case, the capillaries of the most superficial layer of cutis, in the second, the deeper vessels, are diseased. As a rule, this proliferation of vessels does not go beyond the subcutaneous cellular tissue ; rarely it affects the deeper tissues, such as the muscles ; whence it appears that these neoplasim not only grow centrally, but especially peripherally, and destroy the part affected. Most of these tumors may be slowly emp- Fro. 128. Conplomeration of vessels from a plesiform angioma.

But there are also moderate-sized telangiectases, in which, besides the proliferation of vessels, there is also a new formation of connective tissue and fat, so that they cannot be entirely removed by pressure. \Vlien these new formations were superficial in tlie cutis, and the blood has been emptied from them after extirpation, with the naked eye we can hardly see any thing abnormal in the morbid piece of skin that has been removed; a moderate neoplasia of this variety appears on the cut surface as a pale-reddisli, soft, lobulated substance, in which we can see no vessels with the naked eye, because tlie whole disease is usually limited to the capillaries .and minute vessels, and to a few small .arteries.

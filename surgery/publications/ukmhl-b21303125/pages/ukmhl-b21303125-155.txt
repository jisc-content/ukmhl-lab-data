CIRCULATION AFTER LIGATION. 129 cal exercise, to represent for yourselves how, after ligation of the different arteries of one or both extremities, or of the trunk, the blood will reach the parts beyond the point of ligation ; in this you would be well assisted by the plates of arterial anastomosis in JKrameâ€™s text-book of anatomy. In the surgery of old Conrad Martin Z,an~ getibeck, these conditions are carefully described in the chapter on aneurisms. The reversal of the blood-current, which not unfrequently takes place in these collateral circulations, occurs with wonderful rapidity, when the anastomoses are free; if, for instance, we ligate the common carotid in a man, and then divide the artery beyond the liga- ture, the blood escapes with great force from the peripheral end, that is, backward as from a vein. In all such cases, where the artery to be ligated has free anastomoses, if a piece is to be cut out of the artery, we should first ligate both central and peripheral ends, to be insured against hmmorrliage; this is an important practical rule, which is often neglected.

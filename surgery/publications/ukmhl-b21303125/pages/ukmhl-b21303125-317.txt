POLEGMOXOUS INFLAMMATION. 291 oedematous, reddened, painful skin; subsequently the collection of cells in the inflamed connective tissue and fat becomes more promi- nent. These tissues become tense, and there is stagnation of blood in the vessels at various points, especially in the capillaries and veins; at some places the circulation ceases entirely. This stagnation of the blood, which at first causes a dark-blue color, and then whiteness from the rapid discoloration of the red blood-cells, may extend so far as to cause extensive gangrene of the tissue, a result wiiich we have already mentioned. But in most cases this does not occur, but while the cells increase, the fibrillar intercellular substance disappears, partly by the death of small tags and particles, partly by gradually becoming gelat- inous, and finally changing to fluid pus. Fio. C3. Tissue froui a prepuce infiltrated from inflammation. The filamentary fibrillar formation of the tissue has entirely disappeared, from the softeninsr influence of the cellular inflammation. Tlio walls of the vessels are relaxed and perforated. Magnified about 500. As the inflammation progresses the entire inflamed part is finally changed to pus, that is, to fluid tissue, consisting of cells wdth some serous intercellular fluid which is mixed with shreds of dttad tissue. If the process goes on in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, extending in all directions (most rapidly where the tissue is most vascular anti richest in cells), the purulent destruction of tissue or supj^uration will extend to the cutis from within, perforate it at some point, and through this perforation the pus will escajte outwardly; when this occurs, the process often ceases to extend. The tissue surrounding the purulent collection is filled with cells and very vascular; anatomi- cidly it closely resembles a granulating surface (wdthout any distinct granulations! lin.ng the whole cavity. ^Vhen the pus is all evacuated

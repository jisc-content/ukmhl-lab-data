INTRODUCTION. 12 the eighteenth century are insignificant; most of them brought theii knowledge from Paris, and added little that was original: Lorenz Jleister (1683-1758), John Ulrich Bilguer (1720-1796), and Chr. Ant. Theden (1719-1797}, are relatively the most important. Ger- man surgery only obtained greater eminence with the commencement of the present century. Carl Caspar von Siebold (1736-1807), and August Gottlob Bichter (1742-1812), were distinguished men; the former served as professor of surgery in WUrzburg, the latter in Got- tingen ; some of Richter"'s writings are valuable even now, especially his little book on rupture. On the threshold of our century 3"ou see professors of surgery again in the foreground, where they subsequently maintained their position, because they actually practised surgery. A predecessor of old Richter^ as professor of surgery at Gottingen, the celebrated Ah bert Haller (1708-1777), at once physiologist and poet, one of the last encyclopaedists, says, “ Etsi chirurgiae cathedra per septemdecim an- nos mihi concredita fuit, etsi in cadaveribus dificilimas administrationes chirurgicas frequenter ostendi, non tamen unquam vivum hominem incidere sustinui, nimis ne nocerem veritus.” To us this seems scarcely credible, so great is the change wrought by a hundred years. Even at the commencement of this century the French surgeons re- mained at the helm; Boyer (1757-1833), Delpech (1776-1832), and par- ticularly (1777-1835), and Jean Dominique Larrey (1776- 1842), were almost undisputed authorities in their line. Besides them there arose in England the unimi3eachable authority. Sir Astley Coop- er (1768-1841). Larrey, the constant companion of Napoleon I.,left a large number of works; you will hereafter read his memoirs with great interest. Dupuytren was chiefly celebrated for his excellent clinical lectures. Cooper''s monographs and lectures will fill you with astonishment. Translations of the writings of the above French and English surgeons first aroused German siugery; but soon the subject was gone into most profoundly by original workers. The men who induced the German revolution in surgery were, among others, Vincenz von Kem, of Vienna (1760-1829), John Nep, Rust, of Berlin (1775- 1840), Philipp von Walther, of Munich (1782-1849), Carl Ferd. von Graefe, of Berlin (1787-1840), Conr. Joh. Martin Langenbeck, of Gottingen (1776-1850), Joh. Friedrich Dieffenbach (1795-1847), Cajetan von Textor (1782-1860), of Wlirzbin-g. The nearer we approach the middle of our centuiy, the more tlie rugged bounds of nationality disappear from the domains of surger}^ With increased means of communication, all advances in science spread with breathless haste to all parts of the civilized world.

OPERATIONS FOR ANCHYLOSES. 557 3. Total resection of the joint. I have already stated my opinion about the admissibility of resection for anchylosis of the hip and knee-joints, and would regai-d it as ultimum remedium and valde anceps; in the elbow-joint the prospect is rather better; here by re- section we may change the anchylosed joint into a movable false one, which is occasionally quite useful, if all turns out well, but this is the point on which all depends, and which we cannot always master. Who would risk his life for a stiff elbow ? Moreover, in resections for anchylosis of the elbow, the results have not always been very brilliant, either as regards mobility or life, although some cases seemed for a time very successful. So we should not be too free with these resections. In the shoulder, the circumstances are very peculiar; experience teaches that persons with stiff shoulders can, by constant use, make their shoulder-blades so movable that the stiffness of the shoulder causes comparatively little inconvenience ; in such a case it would be folly to operate. Patients with caries of the wrist are usually so glad, when, after years of suffering, the disease at length recovers, that they do not complain of their stiff hand; nevertheless, successful resections of an- chylosed wrists have been recently made by Rose ; it is true, the final results of these ojaerations are not yet fully known. In the foot there would be no question about resection for anchylosis in a bad position; usually defect of the ankle-bones is the chief cause of deformities of the foot after inflammation of the joint. It will depend on the indi- vidual case whether the foot is useful, whether a correction of posi- tion be possible, or if a good stump be preferable.

PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. Almost every time that it has become my pleasant task to go over this book in preparing a new edition, I have thought, this time at least, there will not be mnch to alter; nevertheless, I always found much, very much to improve, to cut out or to add. In so doing, I have always had the satisfaction of knowing that even in short periods the progress of science had been quite perceptible. We do not notice this much while swimming with the stream, but it becomes very evident when we have before us a book that is to a certain extent a photogram of the state of affairs two years since. The success that this edition meets with will show whether I have again succeeded in presenting my book in a shape to meet the requirements of physicians and students. The section on traumatic inflammation has been revised in accordance with recent advances. In the chapter on tumors, the part treating of carcinoma has been simplifled, the term “ connective-tissue cancer ” being omitted, to prevent confusion. The liberality of the publisher has enabled me to increase tlie number of woodcuts by twenty-nine (Figs. 47, 53, 55, 58, 66, 68, 69, 70, 74, 91, 98, 99, 103, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112. 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 132, 133).

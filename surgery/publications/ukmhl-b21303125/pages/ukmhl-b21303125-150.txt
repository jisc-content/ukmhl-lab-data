124 SIMPLE I>fCISED WOUNDS OF THE SOFT PARTS. stantl^'-increiising numl)ers in the thrombus, to the wall of the vessel j tlie arteries, as well as the veins, are coated with a lining of epithe- lium, which to some e.xtent represents the innermost lamella of the tunica intima. These epithelial cells and the nuclei of the striated Fig. 29.

Magnified 40 diameters. larnellas of the intima have been claimed a 'priori by some authors, so that they could let new cells be formed from them, and grow into the thrombus; in his last work, Thiersch also inclines to this view. I acknowledge that I myself formerly strongly combated the supposi- tion that the blood could of itself become organized to connective tissue with vessels ; but from examinations of transverse sections of thrombosed arteries, I am satisfied of its correctness. After having abiindoned the idea of proliferation of stable tissue-cells in inllamnia- tion, we c<an no longer talk of a proliferation of the intima in the old sense. But whence come, then, these newly-formed cells ? I have no doubt that they originate from the white blood-cells, which have been

365 TRAUMATIC AND INFLAMMATORY FEVER. thickening and partial closure of the vessels, etc.). In other cases, the fever begins the very day of the injury; we see this when blood has been enclosed between the flaps of the united wound and it has rapidly decomposed; frequently, also, when operations have been done in tissues infiltrated with the products of chronic infiltration. The following case (Fig. 69) may serve as an illustration of this second class: Pio. 69. Fcver-curve after resection of a carious wrist, with great iufiitration of the soft parts. Recovery. In infiltration of the tissue from chronic inflammation, the finer lymphatic capillaries may be contracted and to some extent closed, and hence, for some time, may not have carried off suIBcient serum from the tissue, but the medium-sized lymphatic vessels, like the cor- responding veins, which in chronic inflammation have long been ex- posed to high pressure, are undoubtedly distended, perhaps even gaping, from rigidity of their walls; hence, if not quickly filled with firm plastic infiltration from the start, they take up a good deal of the secretion from the wound; moreover, on the edges of wounds in mor- bidly-infiltrated tissue, mortification is particularly apt to occur. This explanation of the late and early occurrence of traumatic fever is purely hypothetical; but it is taken from and has been induced by numerous observations. It might also be assumed that in one ease

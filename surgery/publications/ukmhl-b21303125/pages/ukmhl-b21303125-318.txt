292 ACUTE XOX-TRAUMATIC INFLAMMATIOX OF SOFT PARTS. the walls come together and usually unite quickly. The plastic infil- tration continues for a time, causing the skin to remain firmer and more rigid than usual. But, by disintegration and reabsorjition of the infiltrating cells, and transformation of the connective-tissue substance, this state also returns to tlie normal. You will readily perceive that, anatomically, the process is much the same whether it be diffuse or circumscribed; the finer changes of tissue in the two are just the same. But in practice we distinguish between purulent injiltratioh and abscess. The first expression ex- plains itself: by an abscess we usually understand a circumscribed collection of pus, excluding further progress of the inflammation; those forming rapidly, from acute inflammation, are called acute or hot abscesses, in contradistinction to cold abscesses, or those due to chronic inflammation. The following figure (Fig. 64) may render the formation of abscess more clear to you. You here see how the young cells gradually collect at the points where the connective-tissue corpuscles lay, while intermediate sul> stance constantly decreases, and how in the middle of the drawing, in the centre of the inflamed spot, the groups of colls unite and form a collection of pus ; every abscess at first consists of such separate col- lections of pus; it grows by peripheral extension of the suppuration. Formerly, it was not doubted that, wherever pus-cells thus appeared Fio. 64. Dlngrnm of pnrnlent Infiltration of tlio entis connucllvc tlesne, forming an abscops In the middle.

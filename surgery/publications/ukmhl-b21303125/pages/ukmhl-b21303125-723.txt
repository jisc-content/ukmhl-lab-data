C97 CARCINOMATA. If Ave make a section through a hardened preparation of an aci- nous, soft, mammary cancer, when magnified more strongly, the tissue appears as above. I consider the cells in the large connective-tissue meshes as of epithelial origin (Fig. 159). This variety of mammary cancer is mostly soft, granular on section, grayish white (medullary). If we scrape the cut surface of such a cancerous tumor, we readily evacuate a thick, whitish pulp; if we ex- amine this while fresh, we find nodular cells, very pale, composed of large, many-formed cells with large nuclei; many of these cells contain several nuclei; they may perhaps be segregating. The connective-tissue frame-work in which these elements were embedded, when empty, looks about as follows, if strongly mag- nified : The second form, which is more frequent (is harder, and on section pale red), may be termed the “ tubular ” form, as the acini do not maintain their form, but grow into the connective tissue as very thin cell-cyhnders, while it becomes infiltrated with cells. As in this form of cancer the cells from the epithelium do not usually grow so large as in the preceding form, and as the cells collected in the connective Fia. ICO. tissue occasionally lie together in groups, it is evident that it must be very difficult to decide which of these cancers come from the cell- masses of glandular epithelium, and which are pure derivatives of connective tissue, former wandering cells.

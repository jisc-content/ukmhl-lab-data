DILATATION OF THE VESSELS. Y3 now turn again to the more minute changes by which these external symptoms are induced. It will be simplest for us, again, to represent a relatively simple capillary net-work in the connective tissue: suppose a crescentic piece to be cut out of it from above ; first, there will be bleeding from the ves- sels, Avhich will be arrested by tlie formation of clots as far as the next branches. Then, there must be dilatation of the vessels about the wound, which is due partly to fluxion, partly to increased press- ure; an increased transudation of blood serum, or an exudation, is also a necessary result of the capillary dilatation, from causes above ffiven; the transuded serum contains some fibrosrenous substance, which, by the influence of the newly-formed cells in the most super- ficial layers, coagulates to fibrine, while the serum, mixed with blood plasma, flows off. The vascular net-work would assume the following shape: Fig. 4. Dlojtram of a wound, with loss of substance. Vascular dilatation, masniflod .3C0-100 times. In most cases, from insufficient supply of blood-plasm at the sur- â€¢ face of tlie wound, more or less particles of tissue will die; as the stoppage of vessels must, of course, deeply affect the nutrition of tis- sues not very vascular, and, where the tissues are very stiff, dilatation

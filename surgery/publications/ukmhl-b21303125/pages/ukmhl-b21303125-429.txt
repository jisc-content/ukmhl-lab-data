Ge^txemejST : Having thus far attended almost exclusively to acute affections, we now come to the chronic, and first of all to chronic in- flammation. ' In chronic inflammation also, as in acute, there are chemical and morphological changes and nutritive disturbances of tissue ; they are followed by softening and solution, or molecular disintegration, or extensive slowly-developing necrosis of tissue. To these processes are added dilatation of the vessels, exudation, and formation of new tissue. This combination may vary; chronic inflammation leads to very complicated appearances, according as one or other stage of the pro- cess remains more or less permanent, and according as there is dis- integration, softening, or hardening of the tissue implicated, and as to the varied fate of the inflammatory neoplasia. Etiologically, the con- ditions in chronic inflammation are much more complicated ; for there it is not merely a question about an irritation only once, as an injury or a burn, and their sequences, but we have, 1, to explain the cause of the inflammation; and, 2, why it assumes a chronic character. 1 shall first explain to you what anatomical changes take place in the tissues during chronic inflammation, in doing which, just as -we did in acute inflammation, wo shall here take the connective-tissue as the ordinary seat of the disease. Besides the distention and multiplication of the capillary vessels by formation of loops in acute inflammation, we found serous and plastic infiltration of the tissue to be the essen- tial anatomical appearances. In chronic inflammation, distention of

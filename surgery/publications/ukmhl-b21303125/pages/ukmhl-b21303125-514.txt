488 CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE PERIOSTEUM, BONE, ETC. Partial necrosis of the' diaphysis is more frequent than the aix)ve complete necrosis ; this may either affect the entire thickness, or only half the circumference, according to the extent of the osteomyelitis and periostitis. You may readily apply what has been said to these par- tial necroses. Here is an example : suppose a periostitis of part of the diaphysis of one femur and subsequent necrosis ; the circumstances may assume the following shape (see Figs. 87 and 88): a, seques- trum ; b b, its borders; c c, the pus-cavity; d, the perforation out- ward ; e e, the thickened ossifying wall of the pus-cavity. A few months later (Fig. 89); a, detached sequestrum, which is to Fia. 68. c \ \ Diagram of Fig. 87 in the later stages, with formation of new bone. be removed; e e, newly-formed bone-tissue as substitute for the piece of bone that is being lost; of course, the newly-formed bone covers the sequestrum anteriorly, but, as in Figs. 80, 81, and 82, jnust be left out to expose to view the sequestrum.

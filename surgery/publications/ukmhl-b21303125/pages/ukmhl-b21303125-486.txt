The ostitis malacissans may remain in this state; should it slowly progress, it would lead to complete solution of the bone, till only medulla and periosteum remain, and the bone is so soft as to yield to any trac- Fig. 76.

According to my experience, it is just as rare for the medulla in these bones to suppurate or become caseous without some external cause; but this is sometimes induced by violent probing, dirty probes, bruising, or operations. IMild cases of this form of ostitis may recover by formation of new bone in the cavities of the old bone; while severe cases in marasmic patients are incurable and require amputation. Ostitis osteoplastica is just the opposite of the above ; we do not know whether the disturbance of nutrition by which it is started also begins with loss of chalky salts from the bone; the main effect of the disturbance is abnormal formation of new bone in the medulla and in the Haversian canals. When the disease occurs in the long bones, it generally attacks the whole bone at once, and even affects several bones at the same time. The result of this disease may be the com- plete filling of the medullary cavit}', with a tolerably compact bony

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS. LECTURE I. INTRODUCTION. Relation of Surgery to Internal Medicine.—Necessity of the Practising Physician being acquainted with both.—Historieal Remarks.—Nature of the Study of Sur gery in the German High-schools. Gentleiien : The study of surgery, whicli you begin with this lecture, is now, in most countries, justly regarded as a necessity for the practising physician. We consider it a happy advance that the division of surgery from medicine no longer exists, as it did formerly. The difference between internal medicine and surgery is in fact only apparent; the distinction is artificial, founded though it be on history, and on the large and increasing literature of general medicine. In the course of this work your attention will often be called to the frequency with which surgery must consider the general state of the body, to the analogy between the diseases of the external and inter- nal parts, and to the fact that the whole difference depends on our seeing before us the changes of tissue that occur in surgical diseases, while we have to determine the affections of internal organs from the symptoms. The action of the local disturbances on the body at large must be understood by the surgeon, as Avell as by any one who pays especial attention to diseases of the internal organs. In short, the surgeon can only judge safely and correctly of the state of his patient when he is at the same time a physician. Moreover, the physician who proposes refusing to treat surgical patients, and to attend solely to the treatment of internal diseases, must liave some surgical knowledge, or he will make the grossest blunders. Apart from the fact that the country physician does not always have a colleague at hand to whom he can turn over his surgical patients, the life of the patient often de- pends on the correct and instantaneous recognition of a surgical disease.

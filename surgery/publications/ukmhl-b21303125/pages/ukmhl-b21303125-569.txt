543 LOOSE BODIES IN THE JOINTS. mans. Microscopically they consist of a thin covering of true filamen- tary or hyaline cartilage, which, from the centre, ossifies, or sometimes only calcifies. As these cartilages are mostly organized, they cannot be regarded as deposits from the s}movia; but, even if found quite Fio. 103. free, they must formerly have been connected with and have formed in living tissue, and sub- sequently become detached. The actual process is as fol- lows : These bodies are mostly osteophytes, which have en- tered the joint from without; rarely they form in the apices of the synovial tufts. Even normally there are sometimes cartilage-cells in the tufts; these may proliferate, and thus in the tuft we should have a cartilage-nucleus, a cartilage-tumor, an enchon- droma, Avhich subsequently os- sifies from the centre. For a time this tumor remains at- tached to the tuft, but finally it breaks off and then lies loose in the joint. But by far the most frequent form of these articular bodies is from the for- mation of ossifying cartilages (osteojiliytes) in the capsule of the joint immediately un- der the synovial membrane, which may enter the joint and finally tear loose and become free. It is probable that,when once detached and lying free in the joint, these bodies do not grow any more ; although it is not impossible that they might derive their nutriment I'lom the synovia. The development of loose bodies is always accom])anied by some dropsy of the joint; per- haps the latter is occasionally the primary disease. Loose bodies occur almost exclusively in the knee-joint, and only in adult patients; they are very rare, perhaps the rarest of articular diseases. Tiiere is an undoubted connection between the formation of articular carti- lages, arthritis deformans, and hydrarthrus. These diseases are of the same class, and from a possibly congenital or developed general diath- Multiple articular bodies, after CruveUMcr,

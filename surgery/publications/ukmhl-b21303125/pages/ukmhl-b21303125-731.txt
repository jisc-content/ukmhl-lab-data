705 CARCINOMATA. by many elastic filaments, whicli rarely happens in fibroma. But examination of the bordering tissue gives the following; There is cell-infiltration, to a very slight extent, it is true; there is development of small groujss of pale bodies, like Ij^mph-cells, with single nuclei, as in the commencement of any new formation. Part of these cells are arranged in long groups (tubular), somewhat larger than the rest; these are doubtless derivatives from the epithelial remains of the shrunken glandular acini. All the cells of the neoplasm appear to be very short-lived, for they are scarcely formed before they commence to decay, without going on to further development; then the con- nective tissue, which has been somewhat distended, shrinks together, and, as a result of this process, we have the cicatrix; but peripherally this slight cell-infiltration constantly extends; hence comjDlete, sjDon- taneous disappearance of the new formation very rarely, if ever, occurs. If the borders of this tumor be inspected under a low power of the microscope, we see how the small-celled infiltration advances between the meshes of the connective tissue, and closely follows them. Fia. 16G. Connective-tissue infiltration advancing into the cutis from the borders of a cancerous nodule of the mamma; the dark shadings correspond to the advancing small-celled iullltration. Magnified DO diameters. The extension of this infiltraiion into the fatty tissue occurs just as in indammation ; most of the young cells are found in the vicinity of the vessels, so tliat we can scarcely avoid tliinking that in these cases also white lilood-cells escaping from tlie vessels cause the cellu- lar infiltration. As in tliese cases the infiltration of the connective tissue with

INTHODUCTION. 13 personal intercourse, have brought radical changes to the surgeons as well as to others. A generation of surgeons, upon whose works the profession looks with honor, appears to be now dying out; I mean men such as St<xnl&y (1791—1862), LciioTence (1783—1867), and Brodie (1783-1862), in England; Boux (1780-1854), Bonnet (1809- 1858), Leroy (1798-1861), 3Ialcjaigne (1806-1865), Cmiale (tl867), Johert (1799-1868), and Velpeau (1795-1867), in France; Seutin (1793-1862), in Belgium ; Valentine Mott (1785-1865), in America; Widzer (1789-1863), Schuh (1804-1865), and others, in German3'. From our own generation also we have some losses to mourn, espe- cially the irreparable death of the gifted, indefatigable investigator 0. Weber (1827-1867); of the excellent Follin (-1867), one of the most solid of modern French surgeons; of Middeldorpf (1824-1868), the celebrated inventor of galvano-caustic operations. Among the living we might name many on whose shoulders rests the growing generation of German surgeons, but they do not yet belong to his- tory. But there is one point I must not leave unmentioned, that is, the introduction of pain-quelling remedies into surgery. The nineteenth century may be proud of the discovery of the practical use of sulphu- ric ether and chloroform as anaesthetics in all sorts of operations. In 1846 came from Boston the first news that Morton the dentist, at the suggestion of his friend Br. Jackson, had, in extracting teeth, em- ployed inhalations of sulphuric ether, pushed to complete anaesthesia, with perfect success. In 1859, Simpson, professor of obstetrics in Ed- inburgh, instead of ether, introduced in surgical practice chloroform, which acts still better, which, after various trials with other similar substances, still preserves its reputation. Thanks ! in the name of suffering humanity, a tliousand thanks to these men! In continuation of my previous remarks regarding German sur- gery, I will simply add that at jiresent it stands at least equal to that of other nations, and is perhaps even superior to that of France at the present time. To perfect ourselves in the science of surgery, we no longer need to visit Paris. But, of course, it is nevertheless desirable for every physician to enlarge his experience and observation by visit- ing foreign lands. In the scientific as well as in the practical part of surgerj', and of medicine generally, England is now more advanced than any other country. In Ameiica also great advanees have been made in practical surgery. From the time of Hunter to the present day, English surgery has about it something noble. Surgery owes its great revolution in the nineteenth century to its attempt to unite all medical knowledge in itself; the surgeon who succeeds in this, and also masters the entire mechanical side of the art, may feel that ho has attained the highest ideal in medicine. 3

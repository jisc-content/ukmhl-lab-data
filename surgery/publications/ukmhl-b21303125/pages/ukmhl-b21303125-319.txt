PHLEGMONOUS INFLAMMATION. 293 together from mochanical causes. The fat, which is usually plentiful in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, is generally destroyed in acute Fia. 65.

In this preparation you may see the microscopic appearance in inflammation of the cellular membrane. In examining such preparations we not unfrequently find filaments of coagulated fibrine infiltrated in the tissue; possibly it is formed at the commencement of the inflammation, as previously described ; but it is also possible that these filaments appertain only to the fully- formed pus—possibly they are produced by the alcohol. I must call your attention to the fact that, until the process is arrested, we always have a progressive softening of the tissue, or siq> puration, in which it difl’ers from a developed granulating surface, which only forms pus on its surface. All suppurative parenchymatous inflammations have a destructive or deleterious action on the tissue. As regards the relation of the blood-vessels to the new formation of the young tissue and its speedy disintegration, it has already been stated that they are at first dilated, and then the blood stagnates in tliem ; if the circulation be entirely arrested jn certain portions of tissue, in which case the coagulation in the veins occasionally extends a considerable distance, the walls of the vessels and the clot suppu- rate, or fall into shreds, as far as the border where the circulation

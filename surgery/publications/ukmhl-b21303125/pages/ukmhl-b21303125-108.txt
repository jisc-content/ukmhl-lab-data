82 SIMPLE INCISED WOUNDS OF THE SOFT PARTS. of the wound; on the contrary, the latter is finally formed from them. Let me remark incidentally, these fine corneal cicatrices subsequent- ly clear up, so as to leave scarcely a trace. All the cells that you here see in the preparation come from the vascular loops of the con- junctiva ; the normal stellate corneal cells are not visible here. I have chosen this specimen because the intermediate substance is broad and very rich in cells. In very small incisions, made in the cornea with a very sharp knife, tlie intermediate substance is so slight, that it is seen with difficulty ; then, too, the changes on the edges of the wound are slighter tlian here, and so slight a scar is not visible to the naked eve. Here (Fig. 9) you have a transverse section through a twenfey-four- Fio. 8. hour old, freshly-united wound in the cheek of a dog. The incision is well marked at a a/ the edges of the wound are separated by a dark, intermediate substance, which consists partly of white cells, partly of red corpuscles—the latter belong to the blood, escaped between the edges of the wound, after the injury; the connective-tissue fissures crossed by the wound, in which the connective-tissue cells lie, are already filled with numerous newly-formed cells, and these cells have already pushed into the extravasated blood between the edges of the wound. The preparation has been treated with acetic acid, hence you no longer see the striation of the connective tissue, but see the young cells more distinctly. Look particularly at certain strings, ricli in cells, that extend from the wound toward both sides (^> ^» ^i) ; these arc blood-vessels in whose sheaths many cells arc infiltrated; this is apparently because here many white-blood cells have passed through

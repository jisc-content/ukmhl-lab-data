Verneuil first described an adenoma of the sweat- glands. I have never observed such tumors, but do not doubt their existence, since Rindfleisch has demonstrated to me an adenoma of this variety. Those glandular formations that occur in the mucous membrane of the nose, rectum, and uterus, and which are embedded in a gelatinous, oedematous connective tissue, more rarely in some other form of sarcoma-tissue, are more frequent.

Magnified 60 diameters Tumors are thus developed which, in general terms, are called mucous polypi: sometimes they are in broad folds, sometimes nodular pedunculated tumors; they have the color and consistence of the mucous membrane whence they spring, are also covered Avith its epi- thelium, e-xcept only the soft polypi of the extenial auditory meatus; strange to say, these are sometimes covered with ciliated epithehuni. All of these mucous polypi do not contain glands; they are usual } absent from the aural polypi and the small, leaf-like proliferations of

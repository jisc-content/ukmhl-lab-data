Anatomy.—External Peculiarities of Ulcers ; Form and Extent, Base and Sooretion, Edges, Parts around.—Local Treatment according to the Local Condition of the Ulcer; Fungous, Callous, Putrid, Phagedenic, Sinuous Ulcers, Etiology, Contin- ued Irritation, Venous Congestion, Dyscrasial Causes. The study of ulcers naturally follows that of the chronic inflam- mations. Physicians practically agree as to what an ulcer is, and whether any given wounded surface is to be so regarded ; but, to give a short definition of it is about as difficult as it is to define any other object in medicine or natural history. To give you a proximate de- scription of it, we may say, an ulcer is a wounded surface which shows no tendency to heal. Here you see at once, that every large granulating wound with free proliferations, which halts in its progress toward cure, may also be regarded as an ulcer, and, in fact. Rush, to whom we owe our most comprehensive nomenclature of ulcers, desig- nates granulating wounds as ulcus simplex. From personal observations and examinations we conclude that ulceration mostly starts from chronic inflammation, and is always j)re- ceded by cellular infiltration of the tissue. This inflammation may be located in the depth of the cutis, in the cellular tissue, muscles, glands, periosteum, or bones; in the centre of the inflamed spot there is suppuration, caseous degenera- tion, or some other form of softening and breaking down, with grad- ual peripheral progression and perforation of the skin from within outwardly. The excavated ulcer is thus formed ; as before stated, this is a diminutive cold abscess. Just as often the process is in the superficial layers of a membrane, and we have the cutaneous ulcer. We will illustrate this by an

We have already spoken frequently of gangrene and mortification. You know in general what they mean, and have already encountered a series of cases where there was local death of a part; but there are many other circumstances, with which you are not yet acquainted, which favor gangrene ; all of which we shall include in this chapter. You already know the word gangrene to be perfectly synonymous with mortification. Originally it was only used to express the stage where the dying part was still hot and painful; that is, not completely dead. This was called “ hot mortification,” while the moist “ cold mortification ” was called by the old authors sphacelus. The word mummification is also employed for dry gangrene. From the moment the circulation ceases, moist gangrene is perfectly analogous to ordi- nary putrefaction. Although it cannot always be certainly stated why dry gangrene occurs in one case and moist in another, we say gener- ally that when the circulation ceases suddenly, especially if the parts have been previously infiamed or oedematous, moist gangrene occurs. Dry gangrene—mummification or shrinking of the parts—is more fre- quently due to gradual death, where the circulation has continued I'eebly in tlie deeper parts, and the serum has been carried off from the gradually-dying parts by the lymphatic vessels and veins. Rapid evaporation of the fluid also induces gradual dryness. It is cerbiinly

These tumors grow very slow!)-, cause no pain; like all sarcomata, they are sharply bounded from the healthy parts, hence they are movable in the glandular parenchyma ; when they grow large (in the course of years they may attain tlie size of a man’s liead) they almost always form cystosarcomata; in the course of time they become softer and cause pain; ulceration also occurs. The anatomy of these tumors has always excited great inter- est. As the glandular elements, acini as well as excretory ducts, were found in them, it was formerly sujjposed that they had developed in the tumor; hence these tumors were called partial hypertrojjhies of the mamma, I consider this view incorrect, and think that, by ex- amining a great many of these tumors, I have satisfied mj^self that pri- maril}’ and chiefly there is a development of sarcoma in the connective tissue around the acini, the latter being preserved, although they may be changed in various ways. The distention of the gland-ducts causes cysts, at' first slit-shaped, subsequently more roundish, with muco-

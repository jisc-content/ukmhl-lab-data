Possibly the tubercle might enlarge ad infinitum by new cellular infiltration of the tissue around the primary focus, but this rarely happens. The large cheesy deposits found in the brain, testicle, etc., in most cases result from confluence of numerous small nodules, of which we often find num- bers in the vicinity of large caseous nodules. This brings us to the relation of the tissue to fhe tubercle scat- tered through it. I would here remark that the miliary nodules usually appear in large numbers in the organ or jiart affectf^d. Just around the tubercle there is generally a subacute inflammation with free cell-infiltration and vascularization ; this may lead to suppura- tive softening of the tissues, chronic abscesses, and ulceration ; thus a cavity is formed which contains pus, softened shreds of tissue, and caseous tubercle. The inflamed parts around the tubercle may be drawn into the caseous degeneration, and a large cheesy deposit

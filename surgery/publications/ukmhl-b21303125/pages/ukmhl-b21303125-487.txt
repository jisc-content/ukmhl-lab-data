461 SCLEROSIS OF BONE. mass, the a] most complete filling of the Haversian canals with bony sub- stance, and generally also the for- mation of bone on the surface. Thus the entire bone becomes very heavy and denser than normal. This process is also termed diffuse hypertroiohy of the bone, but more frequently sclerosis ossium (con- densing ostitis, H. Volhmanii). Besides the hollow bones, other bones of the skeleton are also oc- casionally attacked, e. g., bones of the face and pelvis; in such cases the bony deposits are spongy, puffed, nodular, so that the bone acquires a resemblance to skin af- fected with elephantiasis; indeed, the diseases are very analogous (Leontiasis ossium, Virchow). Tlie filling up of the diploe be- tween the outer and inner tables of the cranial bones with bony substance is such a common change with advancing age, that it can hardly be considered as pathological, although it really belongs under this head. The causes of sclerosis of bone as a primary disease are entirely obscure; in some cases syphilis may act as a cause, but the osseous formations occurring in this dis- ease rarely attain such firmness as in sclerosis proper. The mal- ady will rarely be recognized with Sclerosed tibia and femur; the former after ... , . , iToWfre, the latter from a specimen out of the certainty during ale, because to Vienna Pathological Anatomical Collection. the touch these bones present nothing more than a certain increase of thickness and a slight ine- quality of surface. Ostitis interna suppurativa circumscripta usually begins in a hollow bone as osteomyelitis. The inflammation gradually extends to the inner surface of the cortical substance, which is dissolved, as we have already stated, and finally completely consumed at some 31

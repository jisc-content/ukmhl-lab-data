A peculiar formation from sarcoma, which is allied to the giant- cell, although never growing very large, may be mentioned berCo In a granulation-sarcoma of the dura mater, which ac- cidentally fell into my hands, there were great num- pig. 135^ bers of globular, multinucleated cells, which were surrounded with a membrane-lihe connected laver of tj spindle-cells (Fig. 135). I hazard no explanation of these elements, but suspect that they are associated with the formation of tufts on the cerebral mem- branes, and with tufted fibro-sarcomata, which Vir- chow calls brain-sand tumors (psammone), when they contain brain-sand. Possibly, these peculiar forma- tions are aborted excrescences from blood-vessels, an idea I have long cherished, and which is apparently r 1 11. 11 1 - •'-Cell-globules from a confirmed by a recently-published observation ot sarcoma of the dura Arndt, who saw these spheres attached to vessels by Mo'uiametersf”^^^^ pedicles, Waldeyer lately showed that these and allied formations, which occur especially in intracranial tumors) start from the perithelial (adventitial) cells of cerebral vessels.

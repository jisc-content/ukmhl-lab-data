TREATMENT OF GANGRENE. 337 The internal treatment should be strengthening', in some cases even stimulant. Nourishing food, quinine, acids, and occasionally a few doses of camphor, are proper. The severe pain in senile gan- grene often calls for large doses of opium, or subcutaneous injection of morphine. For gangrene in stomatitis, after poisoning by mercury, we have no decided antidote; the use of the mercurial should be at once stopped; if mercurial salve has been employed, the patient should be bathed, placed in a fresh, airy chamber, provided with clean body and bedclothes, and have a gargle with chlorate of potash or chlorine water. Nor have we any antidote for ergotin, which causes raphania; emetics, quim'ne, and carbonate of ammonia are chiefly rec- ommended. We could only put off the continued absorption of putrid matter into the blood, by amputation; but we have already mentioned that this is a very precarious remedy in spontaneous gangrene.

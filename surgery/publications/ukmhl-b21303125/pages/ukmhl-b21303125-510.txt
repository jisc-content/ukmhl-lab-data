484 CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE PERIOSTEUM, BONE, ETC. first, it consists of porous bone, but subsequently is more compact and stronger. A regular cast has been formed around the sequestrum, just like we should make of plaster of Paris if we wish to mould an object; this cast, however, has several openings, especially where the pus escapes; their closure is prevented by the constant flow of pus. The above picture (Fig. 80) has now changed to the followino (Fig. 81) : Fig. 81. Diagram of total necrosis of the diaphysis of a hollow bone, with a detached sequestrum and new bony receptacle. The sequestrum a is detached and bathed in pus, which is secreted from the granulations above mentioned; d d, the fistulas leading into the pus-cavity (they have received the name cloaca); e e is the bony envelope derived from the ossification of the thickened abscess-wall, the so-called bony receptacle. This thickening now progresses regu- larly, if the irritation caused by the sequestrum continues. Let us now suppose that the sequestrum escapes from its case (as happens occasionallyâ€”of this later), then, although all the bone of the diaphy- Fio. 82. 0 Pig. 81, after removal of the Bcqucelrum. sis is lost, there is no disturbance of function, for the newly-formed bony envelope supplies the place of the bone that has been lost. Now, what happens ? Will the cavity in which the sequestrum

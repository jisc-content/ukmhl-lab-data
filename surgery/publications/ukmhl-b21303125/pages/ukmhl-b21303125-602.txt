By varices we mean distentions of veins; these may have various forms, and usually affect both the diameter and length of the vessel. Elongation is only possible when the vessel bends laterally, and takes a tortuous course, as also occurs in inflammation of the smaller vessels. In some cases the elongation is less marked, and the diameter of the canal is not regular, but the vessel is distended in a spindle or sack- like shape at different points, especially where the valves are. Most frequently the large veins of the subcutaneous cellular tissue are thus affected; sometimes chiefly the deep muscular veins, often both are alike affected. But there are also varicosities in the smallest veins of the cutis, which are scarcely visible to the naked eye, these are often the only ones affected; this gives an even, light-blue nodular appear- ance to the skin. As a result of this distention of the veins, which occurs very gradually, more serum than usual escapes from the cajiil- lary vessels, as the lateral pi-essure in them is greatly increased by the distention of the walls of the veins, and the consequent insuffi- ciency of the valves. The thinning of the walls of the vessels, and the transuded excess of nutrient material, may be gradually followed by escape of wandering cells, and their organization to new tissue; thus we have a serous, then cellular infiltration, and thickening of the tissue traversed by the varices; red blood-cells may also escape through the capillary Avails [Cohnheim). We have already explained

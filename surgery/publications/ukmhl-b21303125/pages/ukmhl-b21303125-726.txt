This atrophy of the new formation is in some cancers of the mamma such an important factor, that it has given rise to a special form of cancer, “ atrophying, cicatrizing cancer.” It cannot be denied that in its pure form this variety of cancer lias certain pecu- liarities which distinguish it from the ordinary, most frequent forms of cancer of the mamma; hence we prefer to describe it separately liereafter. The development of cancer of the mamma is accompanied by con- siderable distention of vessels and new formation. In the youngest parts of the new formation there are numerous fine vessels and net- works of vessels; in the older, especially in the softening parts, the vessels grow wider, then are thrombosed and destroyed, so that, about points of softening in tumors, similar net-works of dilated vessels form as are developed on the formation of abscesses. The following are the clinical symptoms of the development and course of ordinary cancer of the mamma. The disease usually begins between the thirtieth and sixtieth year, rarely earlier or later; the Fig. 1B4. Vascular net-work from a very young cancerous nodule of the mamma.

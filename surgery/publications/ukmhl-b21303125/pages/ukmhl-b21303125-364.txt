CHAPTER XIII. A (JGIBENTAL TEA UMATIG AND INFLAMMATOR Y DISEASES, AND POISONED WOUNDS. LECTURE XXIV. I. Local Diseases -wliicli may accompany 'Wounds and otlier Points of Inflammation: 1. Progressive Purulent and Purulent Putrid Diffuse Influinmntion of Cellular Tissue.—2. nospital Gangrene, Ulcerative Mucous-salivary Diphtheria, Ulcerative Urinary Diphtheria.—3. Traumatic Erysipelas.—i. Lymphangitis. Gentlemen : When speaking of traumatic inflammation, I told you that it did not extend beyond tlie bounds of the injury, and that this was only apparently the case when we could not accurately ex- amine the injured part. I still maintain the truth of this. But we have already added that, from various accidents, either immediately after the injury, as in contused wounds, there may be very severe progressive inflammation, with putrefaction, or that, later, secondary inflammations may develop around the already granulating wound from causes which we mentioned at the time (Lecture XIII.). I must now tell you that still another series of peculiar, partly inflammatory, partly gangrenous processes occur in the wound, which cause severe, usually feverish, constitutional diseases. Some of the latter may also occur without any thing peculiar being observable in tlie wound. Lastly, substances may enter a wound already existing, or at the time of its occurrence (as from the bite of a poisonous or diseased animal), which may induce both severe local inflammation and gen- eral blood-poisoning. In this chapter I shall speak of all these things; I will try to give you a general view of them. Ve shall speak first of the loctil symptoms which accidentally accompany a wound, or an inflammation due to other causes.

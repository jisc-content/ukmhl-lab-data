PERIOSTITIS. 451 Fig. 74. process affects only the periosteum and superjacent soft parts, the bone is but little changed ; some inclination to new formation is ex- hibited on its surface by the production of a layer of osteojahytes under and in the periphery of the part affected with periostitis. Nevertheless, there is a possibility of the abscess healing slow- 1}', after the pus has been evacuated, and of a return to the previous normal state. Such a recovery of periostitis, without implication of the bone, occa- sionally occm’s in practice, but it is rare. It is far more common for the bone to be also affected, perhaps only super- ficially; that is, for periostitis to be accompanied by ostitis ; not an ossify- ing, but a chronic, ative ostitis • , suppurative, ulcer- a caries superjicialis. Before the abscess has opened, the symptoms of such a caries scarcely dif- fer from those of su]Dpurative perios- titis. If the abscess has opened, we may pass a probe into the surface of the bone, which we feel to be rough and gnawed. The caries had existed some time, and was secretly eating into the bone before the abscess opened; it probably existed when the perios- teum only appeared infiltrated, and was still in the stage of gelatinous granulation. Plence, suppuration is not necessarily combined with caries, although it frequently accompanies it. To make all this clear to us, we must study chronic ostitis by means of prep- arations. The whole development and course are quite analogous to the course of chronic inflammation in the soft parts, but the hardness and difficult solubility of bone give rise to somewhat different circum- Btances. Caries superflcialis of tne tibia, accord- ing to Follin. In the course of these lectures we have repeated time and time again that inflammatory neoplasia is developed in and from the affected tissue; that the close connective-tissue filaments, by rich in-

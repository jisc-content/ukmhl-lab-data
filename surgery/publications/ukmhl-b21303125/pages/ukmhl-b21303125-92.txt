After Arnulil. much to interstitial growth of the walls of the vessels. The original, formerly-existing vascu- lar union is thus replaced by a newly-formed v^ascular net-work which is at first far richer. Quite recently Arnold has most carefully studied the pro- cess of the development of ves- sels, and has seen it go on in the tails of tadpoles (Fig. 3 n.) Although the heart and larger vessels of the embryo seem to originate from appointed cell- groups of the middle germinal layer, by the peripheral parts forming the wall of the vessel and the central parts the blood- cells, later this does not seem 1o occur; at least, observations made on this point by RoMtanshy and others do not seem to have ob- tained much credence. According to Arnold's investigations, off- shoots from the vessels seem to be the only mode of development of vessels in the embryo. I formerly thought that there must be another mode of growth for vessels in the formation of granulations and in some neo- plasia, namely, a tubular forma- tion by laying together spindle- cells, as at a, b, and o, in Fig. 3 c ; this I called “ secondary ” formation of vessels (“ primary ” I applied to the development of tlio heart and larger vessels in the middle germ-layer). The development of vessels by off- shoots 1 called “ tertiar3\” But, since recent investigations, I readily agree that the mode I termed “ secondary ” possibly did

253 CONGENITAL LUXATIONS. rotating the arm vve can easily slip the tendon into jolace ; the pain ceases at once, and all motions are free. For this luxation to occur, the fascia-like membrane which covers the sulcus must tear or be much relaxed. The former is improbable ; where the latter is the case, the accident readily recurs. Some persons have the covering of the sulcus, in which the tibialis posticus muscle lies, so relaxed t'lat they can voluntarily luxate this tendon and let it snap into place with an audible sound. [Cases where the tendon of the quadriceps femoris and patella may be voluntarily luxated and snapped back into place are prob- ably less rare. The translator, among other cases, has had one pa- tient 18 months old who could do this at pleasure, and when u-ritated about any thing would snap his patella even if his leg were firmly held. This leg having been placed in a plaster dressing, he began the same performance with the other leg. Then both legs were left free, and after some weeks, when his general health and temper im- proved, the phenomenon ceased.] 18

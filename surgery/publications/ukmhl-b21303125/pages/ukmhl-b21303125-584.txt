Gentlemen : To day we have to si^eak of those deformities not resulting from primary disease of the joint, but leading to abnormal mechanical conditions, if the articular surfaces from various causes assume abnormal forms, or if while the form remains normal the move- ments be impaired in some direction by obstacles due to abnormal states of the muscles, fascite, tendons, or skin. Most of the cases arc of stiffness, deformity, or limitation of motion of the joint, exterior to the synovial membrane. In this section I follow chiefly the division of VolJcmann, whose extraordinary work on this subject, published in Billroth and Von JPitha’s Archives, I cannot too strongly urge your studying. I. DEFOPvMITlES OF EMPRYOKAL ORIGIN, DUE TO DISTURBED DEVEI.- OPMENT OF THE JOINT. These distortions are always congenital; they are much the most frequent in the foot, especially as club-foot, pcs varus seu equino- varus. Although we may, and formerly did, term all distortions where the foot was drawn together into a “clump” as club-foot, we • From Aofor, oblique, apBpov, member, Joint.

611 ETIOLOGY OF TUMOF.S. detect a local external irritation wli^n a tumor is developed any more than Ave can always do so in local disease in a scrofulous patient, ^^^lile referring you to Avliat has been said on the etiology of chronic inflammations, I Avould remark that in regard to primary tumors we may assume in many cases that there are also specific, so-called inter- iial irritations developing in the body itself. Most pathologists agree to this, but they consider the mode of origin and development of such irritations as being differeiit. Virchow teaches that the local disease must have a local cause, £fnd assumes that at the point of dis- ease there are certain local conditions of debility. If this were soj we should have to assume a specific local debility for the most different disturbances of nutrition and for formation of tumors, Mindfleisch speaks very decidedly of internal irritation as follows: “ By the change of substance in the tissues, certain excretive substances are constantly being formed, which must gradually be passed off from the tissues and organs in which they form, as well as from the fluids of the body at large, in order that the life of the individual may be un- disturbed. These bodies have their chemical position between the organopoietic bodies on the one hand and the excreted matter of the l<idneys, skin, and lungs, on the other; thus they fall into the great gap that exists in organic chemistry at this point; they are different for the different tissues, and on this difference depends the variety of pathological new formations. If they are transformed and excreted normally they collect first at the point of their origin, then in the fluids of the body, and this collection is the immediate cause for the excitement of that progressive process which begins with multiplica- tion of cells in the connective tissue, and ends Avith the development of tubercles, cancer, cancroid, fibroids, lipomata, etc.” I can entirely agree Avith this hypothesis, but must add that it seems an error to suppose that Ave here speak chiefly of local processes. The produc- tion of bile and urine is also a local process ; for them to be produced in such quantities and of such a quality as they are depends not only on the glandular organs, but on the entire organism to such an ex- tent that Ave must seek the original causes of the secretion of urine and bile not only in the blood, but even more remotely, eA'en in pe- culiarities of origin, as far back as Adam, if you please. In the same Avay, I think that the original causes for the local requirements for the development of tumors must be sought in specific peculiarities of the individual organism; in the same Avay Ave speak of a scrofulous or tu- berculous person, meaning the pathological race, as it Avere, to Avhich the individual belonffs, I must lastly add that the supposition that the cause of disease, the irritation inducing tlie tumor, develops local y, where the tumor

New Youk, December 1, 1870. TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. Dueing the past ten years the microscope has greatly ad- vanced our knowledge of Pathology; and it will perhaps be acknowledged that most progress in the study of Pathological Anatomy has been made in Germany. Prof. Theodor Billroth, himself one of the most noted au- thorities on Surgical Pathology, has in the present volume given us a complete resume of the existing state of knowledge in this branch of medical science. The book might perhaps have been entitled “ Principles of Surgery,” but this would hardly have indicated the specific man- ner in which these principles have been inculcated. Most of the views found in these lectures have been fioating through the journals for several years past; but, so far as the translator knows, they are not so fully presented in any book in the English language. The only work in our language on the subject was published many years ago; even the late editions are but little changed from the first; moreover, the two works are, in most respects, entirely unlike. The fact of this publication going throngli four editions in Germany, and having been translated into French, Italian, Rus- sian, and Hungarian, should be some guarantee for its standing. Some few notes that have been inserted by the ti’anslator will be found enclosed in brackets [ ].

It can only be distinguished by very careful examination from some forms of carcinoma to be hereafter described. Plexifonn cylinders, clubs, and spheres of small cells spread out in the connective tissue, separating its bundles and filling all the interspaces between them, in doing which they naturally push into the lymphatic vessels and perivascular lymphatic spaces. It cannot always be determined whether the cells first increasing are wandering cells, connective-tissue cells, or'cellsfrom the walls of the vessels, endothelium, or perithelium ; perhaps they all participate at the same time or after one another. The cells first proliferated are as a rule small, round, or irregu- larly polygonal ; gradually the following often complicated meta- morphoses occur in these cell-cylinders: Vessels grow into them, the middle part of the cells around the vessels becomes hyaline or filamentary connective tissue, the outer cells form a covering for the vessel and the central neoplastic connective-tissue filaments. So these formations have a sort of villous shape, which has grown into the tissue (interstitial papillary proliferations, interstitial papillary myxoma,At the same time the enveloping cells assume

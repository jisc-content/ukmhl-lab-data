219 DETACHMENT OF THE SEQUESTRUM. lions on the free surface; these subsequently ossify and unite with the other callus, forming around the fractured ends. To represent the relation of the formation of callus to this process of detachment of the necrosed ends of the fractured bone, I present the following figure (Fig. 56). The fragments of the broken bone are not accurately adjusted, but displaced somewhat laterally; the ends of the fragments have both become necrosed, and nearly detached by interstitial proliferation of granulations on the borders of the living bone. The whole wound is lined with granulations, which secrete pus that escapes at d. In both fragments, an inner callus (p b) has formed, which, however, from suppuration of the fractured surfaces, has not yet been soldered to- gether. The outer callus (c c) is irregular, and interrupted at d, be- cause the pus escapes here from the first. When the granulations grow so strongly as to fill the entire cavity, and subsequently ossify, healing is completed, and the final result is just the same as in the healing of subcutaneous fractures. For this to take place the necrosed portions of bone must be removed, for experience shows they cannot heal up in the osseous cicatrix. This elimination of the sequestrated Fia. 56.

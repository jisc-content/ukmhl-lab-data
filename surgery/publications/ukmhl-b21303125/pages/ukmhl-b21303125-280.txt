In war many injuries occur that are to be classed among simple incised, cut, punctured, and contused wounds ; gunshot-wounds them- selves must be classed with contused wounds; but they have some peculiarities that entitle them to separate consideration, in doing • which we must briefly come in contact with the domain of military surgery. Since fire-arms were first used in warfare (1338), gunshot- wounds have received special attention from surgical writers, so that the literature on this subject has become very extensive ; of late, in- deed, military surgerj’^ has been made almost a separate branch, which includes the care of soldiers in peace and war, and the special hygienic and dietetic rules which are so important in barracks, in stationary and field hospitals, also the clothing and food. Although the Romans, as was mentioned in the introduction, had surgeons appointed by the state with the army, in the middle ages it was more common for ev'ery leader of a troop to have a private doctor, who, with one or more assistants, very imperfectly took care of the soldiers after a battle, and then usually went on with the army, leaving the wounded to the care of compassionate people, without the commander or the army taking the responsibility. It was not till standing armies were formed that surgeons were detailed to certain battalions and companies, and certain (still very imperfect) rules and regulations were made for the care of the wounded. The position of military surgeon was, in those days, very Ignoble, and such as we do not hear of now ; for, even in the time of tlie father of Frederick the Great, the army surgeon was publicly flogged if he permitted one of the long grenadiers to die.

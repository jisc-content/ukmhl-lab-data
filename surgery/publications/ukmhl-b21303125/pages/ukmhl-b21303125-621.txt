Dtfinition of the Term Tumor.—General Anatomical Eemarks; Polymorphism of Tissues.—Points of Origin of Tumors.—Limitation of the Development of Cells to Certain Types of Tissue.—Eolation to the Generative Layers.—Mode of Growth.— Anatomical Metamorphosis of Tumors ; their External Appearances. Gentlemen : To-day we enter on the dilEcult chapter that treats of tumors. The swellings of which we have hitherto spoken depended only on a few causes; they were due to abnormal collections of blood in and outside of the vessels, to infiltration of the tissue with serum, to its permeation with young cells (plastic infiltration), either sepa- rately or in combination. In contradistinction to these swellings, we now in the clinical sense of the term call new formations swellings or tumors when we suppose they are due to other causes than those of the inflammatory new formations, and have a growth which as a rule has no typical termination, but, as it were, goes on ad infinitum ; besides, most of these growths are composed of tissue which is more highly organized than inflammatory neoplasia. Let us investigate this more accurately. At present you are only acquainted with that variety of new formation caused by inflammation; this is very uni- form, not only in its mode of origin, but in its further development; its development might be interfered with by disintegration, drying up, breaking down iiito pus, etc.; it might proliferate excessively, but it was always in such a way as not to change its character; but, finalIv, if tliere existed no specially unfavorable local or general cause, and no vital organ was disturbed by the new formation, it subsided—it again became connective tissue; the inflammation terminated in cica- trization. Then, if the inflammation was superficial, there was de- velopment of epithelial or epidermis cells, the bony cicatrix ossified,

SYPHILITIC ULCERS. 447 most frequently on the perinasum, about the anus, and on the tongue. The so-called tertiary syphilitic ulcers of the skin often have very in- durated, brownish-red borders, are circular, or horseshoe-shaped, and are also atonic in character. You will see from this that the appear- ance of syphilitic ulcers also may vary greatly, and hence that the mere appearance of the ulcer does not enable us to judge with cer- tainty of the presence of constitutional syphilis. The treatment of true syphilitic ulcers should be chiefly internal, and be directed against the constitutional disease. Locally we should use intense caustics if the destruction of tissue is going on rapidly. Older smgeons also distinguished numerous forms of ulcers that nave not been mentioned here, and that were said to be characteristic of the causes. For instance, in his treatise on ulcers (Helkologie) Must speaks of rheumatic, arthritic, hmmorrhoidal, menstrual, abdom- inal, herpetic, etc., ulcers. But I, in common with other surgeons of modem times, have been unable to penetrate into the mysteries of this exact diagnosis. It is now generally considered that the old no- menclature was based ratlier on an artificial system originating in the old humoral pathology than on critically exact observation. From unprejudiced observation we should unquestionably acknowledge that certain forms of ulcers, particularly when affecting certain localities, enable us to decide on their cause; nevertheless, the appearance and form of the ulcer are very dependent on the anatomical relations of the part affected (e. g., as by the course of the filaments in the skin, JVertheim), and on various external causes, so that we should fre- quently be deceived if we rehed too much on the appearance of the ulcer as an unmistakable expression of a specific constitutional cause.

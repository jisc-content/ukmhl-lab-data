RESULTS OF GRANULATION. 77 If the growth of the granulations was not arrested at some point, a constantly-growing granulation tumor would be formed. Fortu- nately, this is never or very rarely the case. You already know, from the representation of the external conditions, that when the granula- tions have reached the level of the cutis, or even sooner, they cease to grow and are coated with epidermis, and retrograde to a cicatrix. The following changes occur in the tissue : At first, in the granula- tion tissue, as in the edges of the wound in healing by the first inten- tion, there are numerous cells which are destroyed. Not only the millions of pus-cells on the surface, but also cells in the depths of the granulation tissue, disappear by disintegration and reabsorption ; it is very probable that cells from the granulation tissue may pass back un- injured into the vessels, as we shall see when treating of the organi- zation of thromboses of the vessels. As the cells retrograde, fine fat- granules gradually form in them, not only in the round but also in the spindle-shaped ones; such cells, which are composed of very fine Fig. C.

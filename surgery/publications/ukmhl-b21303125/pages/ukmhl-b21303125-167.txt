CHAPTER III. CONTUSION'S OF THE SOFT PARTS 'WITHOUT WO UNDS. LECTURE XI. Causes of Contusions.—Nervous Concussion.—Subcutaneous Eupture of Vessels.—Eup- turo of Arteries.—Suggillations.—Ecchymoses.—Eeabsorption.—Termination in Fibrous Tumors, in Cysts, in Suppuration, and Putrefaction.—Treatment. By the action of a blunt object on the soft parts, the sldn will sometimes be injured, sometimes it will not; hence we distinguish con- tusions with or without wounds. We shall first consider the latter. These contusions are partly caused by the falling or striking of heavy objects on the body, partly by the body falling or striking against a hard, firm object. The immediate result of such a contusion is a crushing of the soft parts, which may be of any grade; often we per- ceive scarcely any change, in other cases the parts are ground to a pulp. WTiether the skin suffers solution of continuity by this application of force depends on various circumstances, especially on the form of the con- tusing body and the force of the blow, also on the nature of the parts un- der the skin; for instance, the same force would cause contusion without a wound in a muscular thigh, that applied to the spine of the tibia would cause a wound, for in the latter case the sharp edge of bone would cut the skin from within outward. The elasticity and thickness of the skin also come into consideration; these not only vary in different per- sons, but may differ in different parts of the body of the same indi- \ddual. In contusion without wound we cannot immediately recognize the amount of destruction, but only indirectly from the state of the nerves and vessels, and also from the subsequent course. In contusion the first symptom in the nerves is pain, just as it is

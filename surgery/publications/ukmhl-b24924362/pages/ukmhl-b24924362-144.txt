SOME REMARKS ON THE 134 proper instrument, there can be no risk, lest air should enter the vessels in large quantities; and the 'probability is, that a bubble or two of air only would occasion little if any inconvenience. It is not objected to the capital operations in surgery, that an unskilful operator may lay open an artery, or that this or other accidents may happen in a moment of negligence even to the most dextrous. In making these experiments on the dog I did not warm the instrument, unless the weather was unusually cold; and though, in the present state of my information, I have recommended tepid water in operating on the human subject, I have a suspicion that heat tends to exhaust the irrita- bility, and destroy what may be called the life of the blood. , i Whether large quantities of water may or not be safely injected into the human vessels, is, I think, uncertain; but there is reason to believe at present that small quantities will occasion no inconvenience, and the injection of small portions only is necessary in performing this operation. Both water, and wine and water, were injected into my dogs without fatal, or even serious con- sequences ; but into this question 1 forbear to enter.

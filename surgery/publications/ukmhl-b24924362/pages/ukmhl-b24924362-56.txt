46 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. Now, these lutea, thus characterized, were distinctly produced both in the uterine and va- ginal experiments. In the uterine experiments I had an opportunity of contrasting those of the fruitful and sterile ovary with each other, and yet, after the most deliberate examination, I could not discriminate the slightest difference logists ; and in stating my belief that this appearance is the result of impregnation, or, at most, of the sexual excitement when ex- alted to its highest pitch, I am only advancing an opinion, which is, I conceive, as far as respects the rabbit, confirmed by observa- tion. I have frequently examined the ovaries of the doe, in the virgin condition, and during heat; and in one or two cases, after the animal had been under the. influence of long-continued and lively desire. In the two last instances I have never found the appearances described, though I dare not, from a negative obser- vation of this kind, deny, that, under these circumstances, their formation is possible. In the first case, on the contrary, I have invariably discovered them, and older or younger in their ap- pearance, according as they were examined sooner or later after impregnation. There can, therefore, I apprehend, be little doubt, that these appearances occurring in the rabbk, are the re- sult of conception. This fact is sufficient for my reasoning. It may, indeed, seem irreconcileable with the opinion which a vete- ran physiologist has formed, respecting the nature of the human corpus luteum (see Philosophical Transactions); but so long as it appears to be confirmed by observations, conformably to sound philosophy, it cannot be denied. I am far, however, from wishing rashly to impugn the opinion of Sir Everard Home. Truths once proved must be admitted, and their apparent incon- sistency demonstrates our ignorance, not their incompatability.

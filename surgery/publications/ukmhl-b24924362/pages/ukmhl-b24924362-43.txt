PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 33 hitherto, we are not, I believe, as yet in posses- sion of any regular system of experiments, which proves that the semen must have access to the rudiments, in those forms of brute generation which most nearly resemble our own. In the present state of our knowledge, the reverse of this position seems, at least, not improbable, as the experiments of Dr. Haighton, a valued rela- tive of mine, , have shewn, that evidences of generation may be produced in the ovaries, al- though the semen has been excluded, previously to sexual intercourse, by the closure of the fallo- pian tube. The principal object of this memoir, which I had formerly the honour of presenting to the Medico- Chirurgical Society, is to contribute some little towards the supply of this defect. In it I have endeavoured to shew, that the semen must have access to the rudiments, in order that the young animal may be produced ; and yet, that genera- tion, although these approaches are necessary for its completion, may, to a certain extent, be ac- complished without them. As the rabbit was the animal, on account of its natural aptitudes, selected for my experiments, it may be proper, perhaps, before I enter on the recital of them, to premise a few remarks on it« r>

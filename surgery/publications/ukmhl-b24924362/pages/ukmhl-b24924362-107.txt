OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 97 quantity only (in this experiment one-fifth of the blood which had been lost) is adequate to the purpose.* From these experiments we may, I think, ven- ture to presume, until we have proof to the con- trary, 1st. That, in transfusion, venous blood may be successfully used, although, perhaps, arterial blood is preferable. 2ly.

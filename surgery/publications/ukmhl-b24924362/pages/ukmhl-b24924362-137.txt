OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 127 Of Transfusion by the Syringe. Should it be found hereafter, by numerous pointed, and therefore decisive experiments and observations, that human blood may lie out of the vessels in the cup for several seconds, without becoming thereby unfit for the vital purposes, there is yet another mode in which transfusion may be accomplished, by the syringe alone, I mean, and this method of operating, if feasible, may be adopted in preference to the preceding, on account of its greater simplicity. In this method of operating a good syringe is required, capable of containing two or three ounces of blood, and furnished with a pipe for the vein, (like that used in the former instrument,) about two inches long, and made to fit by plugging, and a semi-rotatory movement, into the nozzle of the syringe. The blood is to be drawn into a conical vessel, for example, a tumbler, and while flowing into this vessel, held by an assistant, it is to be ab- sorbed into the syringe. When charged, the syringe is to be held with its tubular nozzle up- wards, and the piston is to be pushed slowly on- ward till the blood begins to issue, in order that the air, which from its greater specific levity, will

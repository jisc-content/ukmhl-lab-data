SOME REMARKS ON THE 124 the arms of two persons at once, it would some- times perhaps be desirable. Spirit sufficient to exhilarate and rouse the circulation, may be ad- vantageously given to those who are to furnish the blood before the operation is begun. If the blood, flowing slowly from the arm, show a dispo- sition to clot in the cup, or if the supply of blood fail, the person who furnishes should remove his arm, and a little water poured into the cup of the instrument may be pumped through the syringe so as to displace the blood; thus the apparatus being cleared of blood, will be secured against clot, and kept in a condition to proceed with the operation. If a large bubble of air be absorbed into the syringe, the operation should be sus- pended, the instrument should be separated from the venous tubule, and the blood and air should be cleared, out of the apparatus by immediately pumping through it a few ounces of water, which should be at hand in a small jug furnished with a spout. It would be easy to contrive an instru- ment which would measure the quantity of the blood injected, but I think it better to avoid com- plexities of this kind. Of the quantity of blood thrown in, an opinion may be formed irom the feelings of the person who emits it, or by the size of the stream of blood which flows from the arm, and the continuance of the flow; or by putting wa- ter into the cup after the operation, and working

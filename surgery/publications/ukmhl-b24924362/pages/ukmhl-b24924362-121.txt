OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. Ill accidentally absorbed from the cup, was injected into the vein. For twenty-five minutes the operation was continued unceasingly, during all which time the animal did not appear to be in any way remark- ably disturbed, and immediately afterwards the pulse (naturally 140) beat 160 times in the minute, and the respirations were twenty-six. No intermissions of the pulse were observed, and, throughout the operation, the instrument playing well, the blood flowed in a moderate and equable stream. From a subsequent observation I ascertained that when the syringe was worked .with the same degree of rapidity as it had been during the ex- periment, a full half-pint, that is eight ounces avoirdupoise, were transmitted in the course of a minute; and it follows, therefore, that in the course of twenty-five minutes, during which the operation was continued, twelve pounds and a half of blood at least, probably more, must have passed through the instrument, though the whole weight of the dog scarcely exceeded fifteen pounds. The subject of this experiment was a large puppy of delicate habit, with hanging ears, and with a taste of the spaniel blood. The whole length of tubes and surfaces over which the blood

And, Secondly, it follows, that when the Cesarian operation is performed, the possibility of a second need of that operation may be precluded by re- moving, on either side, a small portion of the fallopian tube, so as to intercept its calibre.* In the third place, it is obvious that when the pelvis is so small, that delivery cannot be accom- plished after seven months are completed, without breaking open the head of the child, the need of this murderous operation may be prevented by the same simple expedient. The sexual de- sires would, I believe, remain, but sterility would be produced; and though certainly not wholly unattended with danger, the operation is perhaps safer and less painful than the extraction by em- bryotomy, which has hitherto been used as a sub- stitute ; it demands, too, no sacrifice of a helpless fetus, and would require performance but once. Should these suggestions be verified, and brought into operation in the practice of future ages, I think it must be admitted that they amply justify the experiments which give birth to them, and render them a benefit to mankind.

Re- spiration, however, was not suspended, nor was the asphyxia complete; but, from observation drawn from other experiments, I have no doubt, that, unless transfusion had been performed, the dog would have died. i After suffering the animal to lie in this state for some minutes, I injected, by means of the syringe, the blood of another dog, (about three ounces,) when the animal became so much re- vived by the operation, that it began to look about it, and was pleased when caressed, though unable, when loosened, to get down from the table.

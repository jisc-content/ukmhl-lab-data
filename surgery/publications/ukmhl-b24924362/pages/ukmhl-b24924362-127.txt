Of the different arteries which may be fixed on as adapted to an operation of this sort, perhaps the radial, ulnar, or anterior tibial are the principal, and of these three I think the radial is decidedly to be pre- ferred, for its conveniency in other particulars as Avell as on account of its easy, access. The artery elected, a tourniquet should be put on the limb, between the intended opening and the heart, in readiness to be constricted, should emergency re- quire, and then, to the extent of an inch or two, the artery should be laid bare with the scalpel, extensively enough to secure the aperture against the obstructions arising from a deficiency of room. This done, the artery should be detached a little, say to the extent of half an inch, and a ligature * Should the small quantity of air lodging in this tubule be found to produce injurious effects, the tubule may be inserted first into the flexible tube, and then, after the whole tubular ap- paratus has been filled with blood, as hereafter explained, the tubule may be slid into the vein; but unless the operator be dextrous and prompt, the blood will become deteriorated, and even clotted, by lying in the inanimate apparatus.

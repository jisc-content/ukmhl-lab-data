OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 95 though languid, was able to walk about briskly; indeed, after the operation he appeared decidedly better than my dogs do in general, and after re- maining languid for a day or two, he recovered completely. The general health was impaired less in this, than in the preceding experiment; the reason of which I conceive to be, that the blood, flowing from the emittent dog more ra- pidly, was more promptly transmitted through the syringe, and was therefore less exposed, and less deteriorated by lying in the cup. I suppose there can be little doubt that, to save a patient, by transfusion, from the death of hemorrhagy, it would not, by any means, be necessary to pour in a quantity of blood, equal to that which had been lost.

What, however, is the smallest quantity of blood which would be sufficient to support life, I have not hitherto laboured much to ascertain; and the rather, because it is exceedingly doubtful, whether conclusions of this kind can be trans-

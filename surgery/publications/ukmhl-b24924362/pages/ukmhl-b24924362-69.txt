PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 59 remote recesses of the genitals. Facts have been related, which give a shade of probability to the conjecture, that without the contact of the semen the rudiments may sometimes descend into the uterus; and certainly, although the opinion is not without its difficulties, it is not impossible that they may meet each other there*. There is yet a third point in the physiology of generation, which the preceding experiments may contribute to elucidate. It has been contended by some naturalists, and not without show of rea- son, that the semen in generation is transferred to the blood-vessels ; and as the purgative or emetic, when ejected into the veins, exert their peculiar influences on the stomach or the bowels, so also, in their opinion, this active fluid, transmitted by the absorbents, makes its first impression on the vascular surface, and its second, by a similar sym- pathy, on the genitals themselves. What effects might be produced by injecting the semen directly into the veins when the genitals are in a state of excitement, I shall not venture to determine; as yet I am in possession of no decisive experiments upon the point, and it would be a mere waste of mind to speculate without them. It seems evi- * Is the transfer of the semen beyond the womb the cause of Â«xtra-utcrine pregnancy ?

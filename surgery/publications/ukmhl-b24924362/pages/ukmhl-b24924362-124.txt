SOME REMARKS ON THE 114 all be supposed to have occasioned it. From viewing this experiment, however, in connexion with the preceding, (exp. 27.) I am inclined to think, that the partial coagulation of the blood, during its slow transmission, in the latter part of the operation, when the jflood flowed sluggishly from the carotid artery, was the most probable cause of death. The quantity lost was not sufficient to kill the animal, unless there were some peculiarity of constitution in this animal not usually found in dogs; and the result of former experiments shews, that it was not the ordinary deterioration of the blood by the syringe that destroyed it, and that it did not die from fear, or from a disturbance of the current of the blood, occasioned by the operation. In exp. 27, in which the blood during its transmis- sion through the syringe became, as in this experi- ment, a little inspissated, very dangerous symp- toms were produced, though the animal surviv- ing the first shock of the experiment, recovered rapidly afterwards. From the preceeding facts we may, I think, infer:â€” 1st. That blood, although it have been passed through the syringe, and repeatedly, is still capa- ble of supporting the life and health of the body. With one exception, all the dogs on which these

92 SOME REMARKS ON THE the operation, but even in these cases, for some hours after the transfusion, a variety of unfavour- able symptoms occurred. As it is clear, from the preceding experiments, that the blood of one sort of animals cannot, with impunity, be substituted indifferently, and in large quantities, for that of another sort of ani- mals ; it follows, of course, that in performing the operation of transfusion on the human body, the human blood should alone be employed, at least, until we have discovered some other kind of blood as well suited to the vessels, as that which they naturally contain. Provided the blood transfused be derived from an animal of the same species with that which receives, it seems to matter but little whether that blood be arterial or venous. In most of those experiments in which, after draining the dog of its own blood, I resuscitated the ani- mal, and preserved its life, by supplying it with blood taken from the vessels of another dog, ar- terial blood was injected, in preference to the venous, because a full supply of this kind of blood might be more easily obtained. To satisfy myself, however, that venous blood possesses the resuscitating power, as well as the arterial,

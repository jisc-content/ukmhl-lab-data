OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 89 artery, and the blood flowed so briskly along the vessels, that when the ligature was re- moved from the carotid, it gushed out in a full stream. Notwithstanding this partial re- suscitation, however, the dog when taken from the table was exceedingly languid, and lay at full length, on its side, in a state approaching to syncope, breathing slowly and cool; and in the course of half an hour or an hour afterwards, it died. This experiment is the more decisive, be- cause the death of the animal cannot be attri- buted to plethora, injection of air, or the pro- duction of too deep an asphyxia, by the abs- traction of the blood, as all these accidents were carefully precluded. It is one of the last experiments which I have made, and I do not hesitate to assert, after all the experience I have had of this operation, that if canine blood had been injected instead of the human, the dog would certainly have recovered. It deserves remark, that a drachm or two of blood, of an arterial tint, taken from the carotid of this dog after the injection, did not become solid at the end of seven minutes, although the blood of the dog naturally concretes in one or two. Now, as the human blood, like that of the horse, is re- markable for the slowness with which it coagu-

EXPERIMENTS ON A FEW CONTROVERTED POINTS RESPECTING THE PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. J&aS/ytne, m /A^ Af/f, / & 6? . ^ ^ _ ‘ ^A^^A /s> .- shz*t_H*£A Among tfie various^q-fieslions which have been raised respecting the generation of animals, there is one, as yet undecided, which has not perhaps been hitherto investigated with all the care it deserves. It may be demonstrated by experiment, that, in this curious process, the male furnishes the semen, and the female the ru- diments ; but whether these two substances must have access to each other, in order that the young- animal may be formed, is a question which still admits of dispute. It is true, indeed, that many naturalists have assarted, that contact is necessary ; and Spallanzani has even gone so far as to de- monstrate that it certainly takes place in the generation of the frog and toad. Still, however, notwithstanding the labours of physiologists

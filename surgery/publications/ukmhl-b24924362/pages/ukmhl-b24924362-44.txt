34 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. genital system*. In the fallopian tubes, and ova- ries, and, I may add, the external genitals of the doe, there is little, when we view the organs as they are suspended in the glass, to attract the at- tention of the observer. It is different, however, with the vagina and the wombs ; these are so strongly contrasted with the corresponding parts of the human organs, the wombs, by their tubular form, and the vagina by its length, its laxity, and the largeness of its diameter, that they cannot be overlooked. The vagina, when full grown, is about four inches long, and so capacious that, without much stretching, it will readily admit the extremity of the fore-finger. Its size, indeed, is so consider- able, that it makes an approach to that of the hu- man vagina, and greatly exceeds the dimensions of the same canal in a moderate-sized monkey, preserved in the obstetric museum at Guyâ€™s Hospital. The wombs, the structure of which is scarcely less remarkable than that of the vagina, are two tubular organs, when unimpregnated, about three inches and a half long and about two lines and a * It is scarcely necessary to remark that this description is not addressed to those who have made a study of comparative anatomy.

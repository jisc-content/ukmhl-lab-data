Notwithstanding this violence, in the course of a few days, or a few weeks at farthest, most of the rabbits recovered their health, and at dif- ferent intervals became fit for the approaches of the male. But though the general health was restored, the recovery was not complete. The operation, as subsequent dissection proved, had the effect of interrupting the canal of the womb, its tubular cavity growing up at the line of di- vision, so that the communication between the vaginal and fallopian pieces became intercepted, and the semen and the rudiments could have no access to each other. In this condition of the genitals, as soon as the sexual ardour was rekindled, the animals were submitted to the male; and, excepting in one or two anomalous instances, out of ten or twelve experiments, they all became pregnant from the Jirst admissions. At different periods from im- pregnation the sexual organs were examined after death with great care and deliberation, when young animals were invariably found in the sound womb, but none in the interrupted. This, it is true, like the human uterus in extra-

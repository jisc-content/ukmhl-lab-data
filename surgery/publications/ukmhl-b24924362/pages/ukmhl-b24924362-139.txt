In weighing this and similar objec- tions, however, it should not be forgotten, that in the present state of our knowledge, it is proposed to perform the operation in the most desperate cases only, when it seems to be the sole remain- ing mean of saving the patientâ€™s life. There is much good sense in the familiar maxim of Celsus, and in the present case it is peculiarly applicable; for, surely, it is better to incur the uncertain risk of venous inflammation, than to leave the patient to his fate. Besides, the pipe should not be se- cured in the vein by ligature, but by the pressure of the finger merely, or the blood may be injected by an artery.

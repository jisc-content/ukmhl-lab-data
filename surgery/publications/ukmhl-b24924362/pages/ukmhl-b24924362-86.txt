SOME REMARKS ON THE ?6 first eleven days, was injected by the syringe, but during the remainder of the term it was transmitted direct from the artery of the emittent dog, by means of a tube. The kind of blood used was the arterial. 21y. At the end of this period I found the dog, which weighed twenty-six pounds two ounces when the experiment began, had lost seven pounds two ounces of its weight; yet, although somewhat emaciated, and in its general health a good deal disordered, it appeared still to be in no danger whatever from inanition.

In the course of this experiment the

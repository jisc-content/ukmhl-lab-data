OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 135 In pointing to the advantages which belong to transfusion by the syringe, in preference to trans- fusion by the tubule, I shall not enter into details. I refrain, therefore, Irom enlarging on the facility of the operation, or its uses in physiological re- search, and shall content myself with touching on those advantages which appear to be the most important. This operation may be performed with promptitude, for the human blood is al- ways at hand; and the instrument may in many cases be procured in readiness, as the danger of uterine bleedings, at least, may frequently before- seen. Promptitude of operating is an advantage of capital importance ; for there is reason to sur- mise, from the preceding experiments, (4, 5, 6, 7, 8.) that the apparent death of bleeding soon becomes irremediable. Another advantage aris- ing out of this method of operating is, the abund- ance in which the blood may be procured. A dog, below the middle size, and this variety, perhaps, is principally found about our houses, generally dies after it has given off from ten to twelve ounces of blood; but much larger quan- tities of human blood might be obtained on an emergency from the friends of the patient, or for hire. But of all the advantages derived from transfu- sion by the syringe, by far the most important is,

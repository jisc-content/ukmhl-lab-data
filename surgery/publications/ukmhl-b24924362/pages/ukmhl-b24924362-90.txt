SOME REMARKS ON THE 80 In the progress of knowledge and the decay of prejudice, should the method of nourishing by transfusion be practised hereafter on the human subject, I suspect it will be found, that small quantities of blood are sufficient to support the body in a state of languid life; and that ill health is not inseparable from the operation, provided it be performed in a dexterous and judicious man- ner, and provided, especially, the blood be inject- ed frequently, in small quantities at once. But to conclude this part of my paper. There are perhaps various cases, in which blood may be transfused with advantage, but three more especially deserve consideration: â€” those, I mean, in which the patient is dying for want of nourishment; those in which the patient is already dead, to appearance, in consequence of copious bleeding ; and those cases, lastly, in which the breathing still continues, although it is pretty evident from the course of symptoms, that death must ensue in consequence of the loss of blood which has been sustained. These cases, under the present modes of management, are all of them desperate. /

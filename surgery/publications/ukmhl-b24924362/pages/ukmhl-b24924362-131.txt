OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 121 ratus, inclusive of the syringe, may be covered in completely by the water, in such manner that the entrance of air into the instrument by leakage, whether of the joints or of the syringe, may be effectually precluded. The apparatus being thus far prepared, the inner cup is to be put on, care being taken to fit the tube which projects below from the apex of this inner cup, to the corre- sponding tube which springs up from the cylinder with which the syringe is connected, and which lies in the bottom of the largercup ; because, if the exact apposition of one tube to the other be ne- glected, a difficulty may needlessly arise in putting the inner cup into its place, in consequence of the two tubes interfering in an obstructive manner with each other. Half a pint, or a pint of water is then to be poured into the inner cup and pump- ed briskly through the instrument, so that the air may be expelled thoroughly, the water taking its place; and the extremity of the flexible tube which springs from the instrument is towards the end of the operation to be bent down into water contained in a tumbler, the pumping being- continued, and this with a view of ascertaining by the appearance of bubbles, whether there be any fissure at which, air enters. The exact tempera- ture of the instrument is not of importance, but the water should, in preference, be milk warm. The apparatus being thus prepared, the operator with his lancet may lay bare, as before, a vein on

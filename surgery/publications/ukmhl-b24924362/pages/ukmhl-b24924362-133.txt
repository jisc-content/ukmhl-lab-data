As the object of the syringe is merely to give im- pulse, it ought not to be worked by long strokes, but by short and sharp movements, care being taken that the p.lug be every time pushed home, so as to bear down upon the nozzle plate and pre- vent any accumulation in the barrel of the instru- ment. If the syringe be worked in this manner, the blood will be little more exposed when trans- mitted through the impellor, than it is when passing direct from artery to vein by means of a tube; since, in order that the impulse may be given, it is enough that the blood be admitted but a little way into the barrel of the syringe:â€”those who are acquainted with the principles of hydro- statics, must be aware that the entrance of a few minims would be amply sufficient for this purpose. For supplying blood, men are preferable to women, as they bleed more freely and are less liable to faint. If blood can be procured from

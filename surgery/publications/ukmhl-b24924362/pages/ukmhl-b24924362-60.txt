50 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. Corpora lutea, I believe, will be found to form invariably after sexual intercourse, if the genitals are excited at all; but in some anomalous in- stances, there is no consequent developement of the wombs, and in others, no accumulation of the uterine fluid. The first of these failures has oc- curred to me once in twelve experiments, and the last of them five times*. But these negative irregularities merely prove, that, under circum- stances, the genitals may be more extensively excited at one time than another. They by no means invalidate the principle which it has been my endeavour to establish on positive facts, that the ovaries, tubes, and uterus, are capable of an imperfect excitement, even when the semen and the rudiments are kept apart from each other. Against the experiments and reasonings ad- vanced in the preceding pages, various objections may be urged, to which it may now be proper to advert. \ And first, it may be objected that sterility is sometimes an accidental occurrence. We fre- quently observe it in human generation. In the * In one or two instances the orifice formed by dividing the uterus remained open in the fallopian piece. This accounts for some of the failures of uterine accumulation. .

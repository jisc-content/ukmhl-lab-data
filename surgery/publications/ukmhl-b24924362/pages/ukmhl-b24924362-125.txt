OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 115 operations were performed, eleven in number, re- covered, and some of them got completely well within two or three days afterwards. 2ly. That although blood which has passed the syringe retain its fitness for the animal pur- poses, it probably becomes deteriorated by this operation, especially if it lie for a few seconds out of the vessels, and be slightly inspissated in con- sequence. In exp. 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, the dogs suffered but little, but in exp. 20, 21, 26, 27, dangerous symptoms were produced. How long the blood may lie out of the vessels with- out becoming wholly unfit for the vital purposes, has not been ascertained, though the principle is well worth investigation. 31y. That the deteriorated blood, after it has, been thrown into the vessels, undergoes a sanative process, by which it again becomes thorough- ly congenial to the functions of the animal; for it will be observed, that most of the dogs, though languid for some two or three days subsequently to the operation, became very lively and well a few days afterwards. 41y. And probably, that dogs of tender con- stitution suffer more from operations of this kind than those which are more hardy ; other circum- i 2

9 AND EXPERIMENTS. In experiments 27, 28, 29, the decoction was of the full strength ; in experiments 23, 25, 26, it was reduced to half strength ; and in expe- riment 24, to a strength of one-third; it was therefore of the full strength in the rabbit that recovered. The rapidity with which death ensued in these experiments, deserves particular notice. The peritouitic inflammation, which I have had repeated occasion to mention, in giving the results of these experiments, was marked, in the more decisive instances, by serous effusion; by accumulation of adhesive matter ; by the aggluti- nation of the different viscera to each other, and the peritoneum; and, in some of the rabbits, by a thorough injection of the smaller vessels (on the large intestines especially) with blood, so that they exhibited a petechial appearance. From the facts ascertained by the preceding experiments, the following inferences may, 1 think, be fairly drawn :— * » - ... \ , < f;.- ... «. 1st. Large apertures into the peritoneum of the rabbit do not .immediately induce a dangerous prostration of strength. In all my experiments, I never once observed any marked collapse in the animal at the moment when the peritoneum was laid open, though I was in full expectation of it.

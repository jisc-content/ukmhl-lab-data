SOME REMARKS ON THE 104 pletely resuscitating the animal, which a day or two after the experiment seemed to be unusually lively and well, and not a single bad symptom was observed afterwards. For the first three or four hours, the pulse intermitted a little, and I suspect that this symptom is not uncommon. Mr. Coleby, of St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital, gave his assistance in this experiment. From the preceding, corroborated by expe- riments 17 and 18, it seems obvious enough, that although the blood of the dog become deteriora- ted, by passing through the syringe, it is not thereby rendered unfit for the purposes of re- suscitation and life. To confirm this principle, however, in my opinion of great practical im- portance, I have been induced to institute another scheme of experiments, of which the following is a brief and faithful detail. 25. I introduced pipes into the carotid artery and jugular vein of a dog, directing their extre- mities towards the heart, and then drew off, by measure, six drachms of blood into the bottom of a conical wine-glass ; absorbing it into a syringe, and afterwards injecting it into the jugular vein.

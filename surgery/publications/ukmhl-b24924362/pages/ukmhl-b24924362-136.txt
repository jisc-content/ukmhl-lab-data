126 SOME REMARKS ON THE of blood to accumulate, in order to prevent more certainly the cup from becoming empty, and thus to preclude the absorption of air. i The miqute dexterity required in managing this instrument may be easily acquired by any person who will accustom himself to pump blood, or even water, through it; and those who are fre- quently performing the operation of venesection must have many opportunities of doing this. When the operation is completed, a pint of wa- ter ought to be immediately worked through the apparatus, in order to clear out the blood, and prevent it from lying in the tubes and becoming- clotted there; and, as soon as occasion serves, the whole should be unscrewed and cleaned out more completely. If the wire-springs which raise the valves are injured, others may be very easily made by giving a piece of wire a spiral form, like that of the spring which has been de- stroyed. If the leather valves are spoiled, others may be made of a piece of soft alum-leather. Both the wire and the leather should be stored in the case for this purpose. The owner of theimpellor ought by all means to make himself master of its structure, and to acquire the little skill which may enable him to set it to rights for himself. Laundy of St. Thomasâ€™s-street, Southwark, now manufactures these instruments.

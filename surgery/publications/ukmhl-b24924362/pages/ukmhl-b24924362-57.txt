In these experiments, it may be further re- marked, the fallopian tubes, as well as the ovaries and wombs, seemed to be excited by coition. I observed repeatedly, in those experiments in which the vagina was interrupted, that the ab- domen of the doe enlarged in a few days after the sexual commerce ; and that enlargement, never noticed before, and gradually decreasing * in a few weeks afterwards, if the male was ex- cluded, might by repeated coitions be carried to a very great degree. There is now in my pos- session, a doe with an interrupted vagina, which has admitted the male from twenty to thirty times. In this animal, in consequence of these repeated connections, the abdomen has gradually acquired so large a size, that it considerably ex- ceeds the bulk of mature gestation, and reminds one of the tumour of an ascitic which requires the trocar. These enlargements, I have ascer- tained from repeated dissections, result from the accumulation of a humor in the wombs. This humor, various in its consistency and colour, is. * It did not, however, subside completely.

OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 85 occasional gaspings; the abdominal muscles too became firm, and the blood circulated so freely, that it gushed out afresh from the femoral ar- tery. The recovery, however, was by no means so complete, as when canine blood is injected ; the action of the heart remained irregular, inter- mittent, and labouring; and the dog, after gasp- ing, and gaping convulsively, made ineffectual attempts to vomit, and died in the course of a few minutes. These symptoms are very similar to those which occurred in the following experiment, and to those which are produced in death from bleed- ing. That death was occasioned, in this instance, by the substitution of human blood for the canine, there can, I think, be little reason to doubt; and this is the more remarkable, because the blood was injected without being suffered, as in the previous experiment, to remain in the cup, and because the animal, immediately before the experiment was performed, was lively and well. It should be observed, too, that the quantity of blood drawn away, was not very large consider- ing the size of the animal, and that a temporary revival was produced; circumstances which make the death the more decisive. The experi- ment occupied but little time, and no untoward accidents occurred.

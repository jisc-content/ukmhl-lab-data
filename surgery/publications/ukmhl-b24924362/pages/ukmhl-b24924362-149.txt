OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 130 into the vein without any difficulty. No decisive effect of any kind was produced by the operation, and the lady died of the fever, without suffering any extraordinary symptoms. 42. A poor fellow in Guy’s Hospital, (his name was Brazier) between thirty and forty years of age, lay at the point of death, in consequence of the extenuation produced by obstinate vomit- ing, arising, as afterwards appeared, from schir- rosity of the pylorus. At the request of Dr. Cholmley, and the expressed wish of the patient, the late Mr. Henry Cline and myself injected, by means of the syringe, twelve or thirteen ounces of blood into the vein usually laid open in venesection, when no ill symptoms, fairly referrible to the operation, were produced. During the first thirty hours afterwards, there was an increase of the strength, and the man ap- peared mending; but at the end of this period, he began again to sink into a state of collapse, similar to that which had preceded the operation, and died about fifty-six hours after the injection. Not a single bad symptom occurred when the blood was introduced. Could the operation have been repeated, it is not improbable that his life would have been prolonged.* (p. 78.) - » See in Med. Chir.

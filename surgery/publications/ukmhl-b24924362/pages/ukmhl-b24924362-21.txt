The rabbitâ€™s abdomen is very tender, pro- bably no less so than that of man. Of twenty- nine rabbits, twenty-one died more or less direct- ly from the operations performed, some of them, it must be confessed, violent ones; and it should be observed particularly, that five, out of seven rab- bits, died from the splenic operation carefully performed; though both cases, hereafter recorded, in which the human spleen was removed, under circumstances to appearance highly unfavourable, terminated in complete and uninterrupted re- covery. The general impression left on my mind by many observations is, that the abdomen of the rabbit is, on the whole, no less tender than the human. 61y. It follows, from the former inference, that success in abdominal operations on the rabbit, furnishes a presumption in favour of success in similar operations on the human abdomen; and therefore, from these experiments, we may infer presumptively that moderate openings into the hu- ' man peritoneum will not necessarily, nor even generally, prove fatal from inflammation or other-

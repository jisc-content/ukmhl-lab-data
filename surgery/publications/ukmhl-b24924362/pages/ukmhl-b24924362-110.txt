SOME REMARKS ON THE 100 mal not ceasing to respire altogether, though struggling, stretching of the limbs, and the usual outcry which sometimes precedes dissolution were produced- The muscles became very relaxed. After the dog had lain in this languid state for a few minutes, I injected several ounces of blood in quantities of half an ounce at a time, suffering it to become a little inspissated in the cup of the syringe before it was infused. â€¢ By this injection the dog was revived a good deal, so that it was able to walk; but for some hours afterwards it remained dull and languid, and disposed to lie about. The day after the operation it seemed, as usual, to be a good deal better, but declined a little in the evening, and the day following it refused its food, and seemed so languid and unwell, that I really feared it would die. In the course of a few hours more, however, it recovered from this attack, and a few days afterwards became completely well. Whe- ther the ill health, greater than ordinary in this case, was occasioned by the entrance of air to- gether with the blood, by the inspissation of the blood, or by the transfusion of too small a quan- tity, I am unable to determine; but of the causes enumerated, I think the inspissation of the blood to be the most probable.

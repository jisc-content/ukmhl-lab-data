it/ a J t/ Off J PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS. SUBSTANCE OF A PAPER READ BEFORE THE MEDICO-CHIRURGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON UJ THE YEAR, 1823 : , Tltcm^OV nxcvfov Oe. Of^II the Branches of Surgery there is none, I conceive, which in this country admits of greater improvement than the Surgery of the Abdomen, the great importance of which it is unnecessary to enforce. With a view to this improvement it is, that I have been induced to accumulate the following Facts and Observations ; and in lay- ing them before the Profession it may be proper to remark, that where there is no observation to the contrary, I can vouch for their being substan- tially correct. * As this abstract was made several months after the reading of the Paper before the Medico-Chirurgical Society, and as some of the Rabbits died in that interval, the' results and inferences here stated do not correspond exactly with the inferences and results as stated in that Paper.

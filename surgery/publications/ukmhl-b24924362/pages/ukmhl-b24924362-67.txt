Two of them, it must be acknow- ledged, are a little obscure ; though an experi- enced eye, I conceive, would readily detect them. The remaining two are very distinct, and differ from the corpus luteum of genuine impreg- nation, merely from their more diminutive size, and the less extensive vascularity of the contigu- ous parts of the ovary. In every other respect, in colour and form, and the cavity which they contain, their appearance is perfectly natural, indeed so much so, that I occasionally circulate them in the class-room, as accurate specimens of the luteum upon the small scale. On this point I have been the more explicit, both as the principle is of some importance in forensic medicine, and as it removes at once an objection to which these experiments lie exposed, and which is taken from those of Dr. Haighton. In these experiments, very ingenious, and ex- tremely beautiful, my valued relative has shewn, with his usual accuracy, that the corpus luteum may form though the fallopian tube have been obliterated in some part of its course, and the access of the semen to the rudiments therefore have been intercepted.

PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 55 than the intestines of the animal themselves. This canal indeed, during the heat, is never at rest; it shortens, it lengthens, it changes con- tinually in its circular dimensions; and, when irritated especially, will sometimes contract to one-third of its quiescent diameter. Now this peristaltic action, resembling the intestinal, is itself sufficient to explain the transmission of the semen*. In addition to this action, however, the vagina performs another, easily comprehended on inspection, although, as frequently happens, the verbal description of it may perhaps appear a little obscure. The action to which I here allude consists in the falling down, as it were, of that part of the vagina which lies in the vicinity of the wombs ; so that it every now and then lays itself as flatly over their orifices as we should apply the hand over the mouth, in our endeavours to stop it. So close is this application, that I have some- times fancied I could perceive externally some- thing resembling a little dimple, occasioned by the sinking of the surface of the vagina into the orifice of the womb. How well adapted the whole of this curious movement is for the intro- * There is some little reason for surmising that even the hu- man vagina can perform a sort of peristaltic movement. Two facts have been related to me which lead to this opinion, but they ate of a character too delicate for public exposure.

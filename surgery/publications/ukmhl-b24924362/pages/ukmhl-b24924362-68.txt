58 . PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. " t from this, in opposition to the principle asserted in this memoir, that the ovary has been impreg- nated, notwithstanding the interception of the semen, he certainly falls into one of those errors, from which the most wary physiologist is never absolutely exempt ; for the corpus luteum in the rabbit is not a certain evidence of impreg- nation. The appearances related, I may further remark, afford, when combined with others, a plausible proof that the semen sometimes penetrates as far as the ovaries; a point which has been much controverted. In the varieties of human generation, we some- times meet with extra-uterine pregnancies, in which the ovum not only lodges in the tubes, or the peritoneal cavity, but in the ovary itself. Indeed, this form of the disease seems on the whole to be the most common. Now, if it be true, as I have endeavoured to prove, that the young animal cannot be formed unless the semen have access to the rudiments, it is evident, that in these pregnancies, in which the fetus is generated among the graafian vesicles, the sellien must have made its way up to the ovaries themselves. It must not, however, be too hastily inferred from this, that the semen always penetrates into these

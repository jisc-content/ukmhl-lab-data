OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 113 a dog, I transmitted the blood through the syringe for two or three minutes together, after which the flow from the artery became sparing, and I suspended the operation for two or three minutes longer, to give the animal an opportu- nity of recovering. When the operation was re- newed, the tubule slipped accidentally from the carotid artery, and two or three ounces of blood were lost before the artery could be secured ; at length, however, the pipes were replaced, and the operation proceeded, the blood flowing slowly from the arterial tubule, either in consequence of partial closure, or, as I strongly suspected, from the want of a full action of the ventricle; and the blood in the cup assumed a slightly gelatinous consistency. On this occasion the operation was continued for two or three minutes as before, at the end of which, the dog was seized with a few spasmodic contractions of the dorsal muscles, and died without a further struggle. The cause of death in this experiment is not obvious. The transmission of blood through the syringe, the partial coagulation of it, the distur- bance of the circulation by the injection of the blood along the jugular vein into the heart, the loss of two or three ounces of blood when the tubule was pulled out of the artery, the impres- sion of fear under which the dog laboured, may

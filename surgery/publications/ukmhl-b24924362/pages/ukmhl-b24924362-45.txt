PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 35 half in their diameter; they are therefore, it is obvious, very unlike the human uterus, and rather resemble that of several of our domesticated ani- mals, as the cat, for instance, the bitch, and the females of the rat and mouse tribe. These two wombs, it should be further remarked, communi- cate with the vagina by two distinct orifices; and they are so completely independent of each other, that the one may be removed without injury to the other, excepting a slight and superficial wound of that part where their necks lie in contact, and cohere. Both the wombs and the vagina are, in these animals, furnished with longitudinal and annular fibres of a muscular structure, similar in kind to those of the intestines, but grosser and more dis- tinct. In addition to these, along the inner mar- gin of the wombs, from one extremity to the other, there runs a broad strip of fleshy fibres, which may, perhaps, not improperly be denomi- nated the mesometric. I give the muscle this name, because it covers no inconsiderable por- tion of what may be called the mesometry; a de- licate double membrane, the production of the peritoneum, which performing, for the tubular wombs, the office of a mesentery, unites them, like the intestines, to the spine. It is allied to the broad ligaments of the human womb. d 2

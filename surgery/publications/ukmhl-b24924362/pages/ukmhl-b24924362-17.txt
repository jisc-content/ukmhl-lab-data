I and experiments. 7 17. One of these rabbits died seven months af- terwards, full grown, and not obviously cachectic, with one of the purulent sacks already described seated internally, immediately over the abdo- minal wound. 18. The second rabbit is alive still, and appears large, fat, and healthy. Into the peritoneum of four rabbits I threw about an ounce of human urine, of a full yellow colour ; left it there for an hour; then discharged it, and washed out the peritoneum thoroughly, by injecting tepid water. They all suffered much collapse from this experiment; and while the urine remained in the abdomen among the viscera, they dragged the hinder legs after them, as if slightly paralytic: the injection of the tepid water seemed to soothe them. Of these rabbits, 19. The first, a fat buck, never recovered , from a state of collapse, and died in less than twenty-four hours after the experiment. The peritoneum exhibited no obvious marks of in- flammation. 20. The second, also a fine fat buck, died in sixty hours, in part, at least, from peritoneal inflammation; there was purging. The inflam- mation seemed greatest nearest the wound.

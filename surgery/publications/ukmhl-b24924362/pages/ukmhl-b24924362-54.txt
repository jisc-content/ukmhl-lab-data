PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 44 does not, as we might have been led from pre- vious reasonings to expect, prevent the subse- quent developement of the sexual organs. But to return from these details. Although it appears probable, from the pre- ceding experiments, that the complete process of generation requires the access of the semen to the rudiments, it seems equally certain, from a variety of appearances which I noticed in the course of my experiments, that to -a certain ex- tent, though imperfectly, it may be accomplished without it. These appearances I shall now pro^ ceed to state. In both the uterine and vaginal experiment, the womb, though it contained no fetuses, in many cases enlarged, as in extra-uterine pregnancy. Its structure, too, became thoroughly developed ; it received more copious supplies of blood ; in short, it frequently seemed as well prepared as its fellow, for receiving and cherishing the rudi- ments*. The ovaries, too, I may further add, although * It deserves notice, that, in the uterine experiments, it was generally the fallopian portion of the womb to which the semen was not applied, and not the vaginal to which it was applied, which appeared to undergo these changes in the highest degree.

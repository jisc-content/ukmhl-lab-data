By pressing the tubule home into the flexible tube, and giving it at the same time a semi-rota- tory movement, the junction may be made sure. The apparatus being thus prepared, the blood should be admitted to it by opening the spring forceps, and by means of the same instrument: the rapidity of the flow, as well as the moment of its cessation, may be regulated with great nicety. After the operation has been concluded, the wounds and the injured vessels must of course be managed on the general principles of surgery; and it may not be amiss to remark, that if, with a view of facilitating the operation, the artery of the person who emits the blood have been detach- ed a little from its bed, when ligatures are after- wards applied, those ligatures ought to be applied close to that part where the vessel still remains in connexion with the cellular web, in order that the adhesion of the sides of the artery may not be interrupted, for want of connexion with the vasa vasorum. The instruments required for this operation should, I think, be shut up in the same case with the impellor hereafter described. Those which I would recommend, are the following:—a tourni-

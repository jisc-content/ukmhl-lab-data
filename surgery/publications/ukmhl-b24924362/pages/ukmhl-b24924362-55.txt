PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 45 there was no genuine impregnation of them, were very obviously excited. The vesicle in different parts of them germinated; its fluids increased; the delicate covering opened; the little cavity discharged its contents, and corpora lutea formed in all their perfection. As this appearance of the corpus luteum, notwithstanding the interception of the semen, is of considerable importance, and may help to clear away an objection to which the experiments lie open, it becomes necessary to examine it with attention. The corpus luteum in the rabbit, as long as it remains, is, I think, always marked by pretty strong characteristics, though its appearance dif- fers considerably with its age. A mammillary projection of the ovary, an augmented vascularity, a minute cavity, which, when the luteum is cut through, recalls to mind the appearance of a printed asterisk (*), constitute the leading charac- teristics ; and by these, I may add, it is so de- cisively marked, that, although the parts are on a small scale, an experienced eye may. detect it at a glance. Colour is of little use in distinguish- ing these bodies in the rabbit. The younger the luteum is, the more prominently the characteristics appear 1 In giving the name of corpus luteum to the appearance here described, I merely adopt the nomenclature of preceding physio-

48 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. however, generally fluid and pale, and turbid, and always, so far as my experiments have ex- tended, forms albuminous concretions at a tem- perature below boiling heat. Even in the uterine experiments, (for the preceding remarks refer to the vaginal only,) the same essential appearances were observed ; the wombs, in consequence of impregnation, became filled, on the sound side, with fetuses, and on the barren with the humor described. These facts are very significant. The forma- tion of the lutea, the developement of the wombs,' and, above all, the repeated accumulations of fluid there, in consequence of coition, all seem to indicate the descent of the rudimental mate- rial; and reflecting upon them, I cannot forbear imagining that the tubes were excited, that they really transferred the rudiments to the womb, and that these rudiments engendered the watery ac- cumulations there, in the abortive attempts of generation. This notion receives some little countenance from the generation of oviparous animals; for in many of the different species re- ferred by naturalists to this class, the rudiments may be discharged independently of preceding impregnation. The common fowl is an example of this ; the frog, the toad, and a numerous tribe of fishes. This opinion, however, is merely con-

The second died about four days complete after the operation, with well-marked inflamma- tion of the peritoneum, as in the preceding case. 7. The third recovered for a time, and seemed likely to survive, but three months and a half after the operation, it died with a diffused peri- tonitis, and a large sack between the left portion of the liver and stomach, as big as a large orange, and full of a fluid like whey and custard mixed. Of the smaller rabbits, 8. The first died five complete days after the operation, with purging and inflammation of the peritoneum.

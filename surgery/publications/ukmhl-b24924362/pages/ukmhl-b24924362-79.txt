OPERATION OE TRANSFUSION. 69 fourteen minutes after the opening" of the carotid that apparent death occured; so that in this, as in the subsequent experiment, (9) thirteen or fourteen minutes, instead of three or four, elapsed before apparent death was produced. Thirty-five minutes after the attack of apparent death, and about fifty minutes after the artery was opened, I transfused blood by means of a tubular apparatus, not above four inches long, into the carotid artery, instead of the jugular vein of the animal, directing it towards the heart; and though the quantity which entered i# could not be exactly ascertained, as the blood was not seen, there is reason to believe it was considerable, for the emittent dog was very languid afterwards.

KÂ» ... 60 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. dent, however, from the facts related, that after transmission through the absorbents and their glands, tlie semen retains no such generative in- fluence. It will be readily conceded, that when a rabbit admits a large male, in vigorous health, and in the flower of its age, as many as twenty or thirty times, a large quantity of the genital fluid must be imbibed by the absorbents of the vagina, yet neither in the uterine nor the vaginal experi- ment, in which these repeated coitions sometimes took place, was impregnation by absorption ac- complished. The simple exclusion of the semen from the rudiments always prevented the forma- tion of the young animal; in the vaginal experi- ments it was not produced at all ; in the uterine it was formed on that side only where the womb remained pervious. On a review of the whole inquiry, it will, I conceive, appear not improbable that, for the completion of generation, the semen must have access to the rudiments; and yet that notwith- standing the necessity of these approaches for its completion, the process to a certain extent may be accomplished without them. These are the two leading propositions which it has been my endeavour to establish; at the same time I have subordinate^ attempted further to shew, that the corpus luteum is not a proof ot ge- nuine impregnation; that the semen, at least

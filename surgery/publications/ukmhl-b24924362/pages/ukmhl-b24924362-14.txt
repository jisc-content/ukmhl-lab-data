4 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS In four experiments the left kidney was taken out of the rabbit, through an incision upon the outer edge of it, about an inch long, very large for the bulk of the animal: the kidney was drawn up through the wound, and the superior half of the peritoneal attachment, thus put on the stretch, was, together with the vessels, included in the ligature. The rabbits were of a spare habit, and were all under their full size, as they had not reached their puberty. Of these animals, 1. The first died about sixty hours after the extirpation, with inflammation of the abdomen. * t 2. The second died about four and a half days after the operation, with the same disease strongly characterized. 3. The third rabbit recovered, lived for five or six weeks and then died, from a cause which ill- health prevented me from exploring. 4. And the fourth also for a short time recover- ed, fattened, and grew, but at the end of five or six weeks it died in like manner, with a sack in the seat of the extirpated kidney, formed by the peritoneum, and filled with a semi-fluid, in colour and consistency like custard; the cyst was not burst; the remaining kidney was, I think, enlarged;

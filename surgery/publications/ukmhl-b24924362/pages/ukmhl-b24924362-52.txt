42 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. upon brutes, as well as my fellow-creatures, I cannot forbear imagining, that the risk of exten- sive inflammation, from local injury of the 'perito- neum, has been exaggerated, perhaps greatly. The high importance of this principle* * in surgery, is too obvious to require a comment; already a sufficient number of observations has been accu- mulated, to induce us to examine it with atten- tion; and I may add, that it is one of those grand practical points, which ought not to be decided by a few casual facts, much less by authorities, however venerable; but, like every other princi- ple of a solid philosophy, by various, deliberate, and unbiassed experiment and observation. If in performing this operation (as in the first set of experiments,) the womb is divided, the in- cision should be made transversely near its mouth, in order that we may leave the fallopian piece as large as possible, for the reception of the ova, in case the genitals should have power to form them. It ought, too, to be carried from four to six lines into the mesometry, in order that the pieces thus between the rectum and the uterus, without exciting a general in- flammation of the belly. * This paper was read before the Medico-Chirurgical Society in the May of 1819. Finding that the principle here referred to did not excite so much attention as I conceive it ought to do, I Iwas afterwards led, in the paper on abdominal surgery, again to bring it undcf'the notice of the profession.

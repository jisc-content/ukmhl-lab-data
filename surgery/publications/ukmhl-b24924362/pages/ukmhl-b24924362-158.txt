144 PLATE III. Fig. 1. Perpendicular section of the Impellor. A. C. B. The inner cup. A. D. B. The outer cup full of water. D. E. The vice. a.b. A line on the inner cup above which the blood should not be suffered to rise. c. d. The upper valve, armed with two or three folds of soft alum leather. e.f. The under valve, idem. g. h. i. Jc. The syi'inge. l. The plug. B. A mark on the piston-rod indicating the elevation to which the plug l. has been raised. The space covered with dots represents that portion of the instrument which is filled with blood. The space covered with lines represents that portion of the instrument which is full of water. m. n. The flexible tube. n. o. The venous tubule. When the piston of the syringe is raised, the blood is drawn from the cup A. C. B. down pipe C. through the upper valve c. d. into the syringe; and reflux from that part of the instrument which lies below the under valve e f. is prevented by the closure of the valve. When the piston is depressed, the blood is expelled through the valve e.f. along the pipes m. n. oâ– ; and re- flux into the cup A. C. B. is prevented by the closure of the valve c. d. Except the plug joint at n. all the joints at which air might enter and mix with the blood, are covered with water, by which means the instrument is rendered air- secure. With a view of avoiding complexity, the springs which raise the valves are not represented. Fig. 4. The curve of the wire forming the spring which raises the valves. Fig. 2. The valve with the springs mounted. Fig. 3. Spring forceps.

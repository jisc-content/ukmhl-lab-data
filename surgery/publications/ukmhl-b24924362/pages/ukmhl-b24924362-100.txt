90 SOME REMARKS ON THE lates, this fact goes to prove that the blood trans- fused, still retained the properties of human blood although it had been circulated for some minutes in the vessels of the animal. Whether the vessels of the dog, when the animal lives, as in experi- ment (14), possess the power of assimilating the human blood to its own is uncertain, but the affirmative is probable. These experiments acquire additional strength, when associated with others instituted by Dr. Leacock,* of Barbadoes, a few months before; experiments to which I am wholly indebted for my first notions on this point. From these it ap- pears, that if a dog be drained of its blood until apparent death be produced, it may, indeed, be revived, for a time, and very completely too, by replenishing it from the sheep, but it generally dies in a few days afterwards. Connected with my own, these experiments of Dr. Leacock possess a peculiar interest, for though they harmonize with them in the general result, they differ from them materially in their circumstances.

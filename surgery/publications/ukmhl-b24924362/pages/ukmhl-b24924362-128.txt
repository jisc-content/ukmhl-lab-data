118 SOME REMARKS ON THE should be put on the vessel below, close against the part where it remains connected with the cellular web and the vasa vasorum; and about an inch from this ligature, a pair of spring forceps should be applied, which, closing of themselves, may press the sides of the artery together, so as to close it completely. The artery should then be laid open with a lancet to the extent of a line, (one-eighth of an inch) so as to allow the ready entrance of a small tube, and this opening should be made in the course of the vessel, as the artery, I find, when divided across, contracts more in its calibre, and, if the incision be a little too deep, is in danger of breaking completely through. A small tubule, about the size of a crow-quill, in connexion with a flexible tube, about as large as a goose-quill, should then be introduced into the artery with its extremity towards the heart, and should be secured there by means of a lig- ature'; the ridge, or shoulder, near its orifice, will give it a bearing line, and prevent its slip- ping out. The operation being brought to this point, the small arterial forceps are opened by pressing the handles together, so as to give pas- sage to the blood and expel the air from the tubes; after which, the forceps are suffered again to close, and the tubular apparatus being full of blood, the flexible tube is firmly connected with the tubule in the vein. With a moderate share of dexterity, the junction may be easily

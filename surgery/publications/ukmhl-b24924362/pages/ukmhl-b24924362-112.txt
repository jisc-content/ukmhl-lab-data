102 SOME REMARKS ON THE all the blood which could be got out by means of the tubule, to the amount of four ounces and a half: somewhat less than the full measure usually obtained from dogs of the same bulk as this animal. Complaint, struggling, gasping, syncope, and relaxation of the abdominal mus- cles were produced, and in this condition, ap- proaching to complete asphyxia, the dog was suffered to lie for a few seconds. * I then, by means of a syringe, transfused ar- terial blood taken from another dog, to the amount of four measured ounces ; the blood, ow- ing to some impediments in the operation, lying some three or four seconds, at least, in the cup before it was transfused. In a few seconds the Â» dog recovered, and on opening the carotid ar- tery, the blood was found to break out afresh; not sluggishly, as in the experiment with human blood, but in an impetuous stream; and the dog, upon being untied, got up without difficulty, and leaped down, in a somewhat playful manner, from the table.

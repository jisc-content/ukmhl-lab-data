PHYSIOLOGY OP GENERATION. 53 a few weeks after recovery, both the rabbits be- came impregnated. The inference is obvious. v The second set of experiments, turning on the same principle, was executed on the wombs them- selves. In these both the wombs were divided, the one in two, and the other in three places, in such a manner, however, that the incision was not carried completely across into the mesome- try; so that the pieces were retained in mutual apposition, and reunited without interruption to the uterine canal. The result of these experiments was decisive. From the very method of operating it is obvious the wombs were more roughly handled in this than in any of the preceding experiments ; ac- cordingly a larger number of the rabbits died ; and yet, notwithstanding this violence, the very first doe which recovered, produced no less than nine fetuses from her first intercourse with the male. Indeed so complete was the action of the uterus, that there was not one of the little masses of rudimental matter which it failed to mature ; and it was found, on a careful comparison of the wombs with the ovaries, that the number of fe- tuses and corpora lutea was the same. To these remarks I may add, that the human womb, al- though it have been cut or torn, or partially

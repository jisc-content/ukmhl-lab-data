OPERATION OK TRANSFUSION. 81 Of the kinds of blood proper for the operation of trans- fusion, when performed on the human body. When the blood of one genus of animals is added, in small quantities, to that of another genus by transfusion, we have reason to be- lieve, (in the present state of our knowledge,) that no dangerous consequences will ensue; and I have heard Dr. Haighton assert, that after taking a few ounces of blood from the dog, he has afterwards transfused that of the sheep, in its place, without producing dangerous symp- toms. Now, if further experiments, multiplied and varied, should thoroughly confirm this principle, we may hope to find hereafter, that the blood of animals may be safely thrown into the human vessels, in small quantities daily, for the pur- poses of nourishment, instead of the human blood, which it must be more difficult to procure. Although, however, the blood of one genus of animals may, perhaps, without fatal conse- quences, be sparingly mixed with large quan- tities of the blood of another genus, all the facts, which have hitherto come to my knowledge, go to prove, that if an animal be drained of the blood in its larger vessels,, and replenished with large G \

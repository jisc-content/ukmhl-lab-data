A contrary opinion, so far as it is errone- ous, must exert a very baleful influence upon the progress of surgery. Whilst the body of facts which have reference to abdominal injuries remains so small, it would, no doubt, be the extreme of rashness, on such authority, to recommend to practice any opera- tions as yet untried, or of rare performance, unless indeed in those cases in which they secure the only remaining chance of life.

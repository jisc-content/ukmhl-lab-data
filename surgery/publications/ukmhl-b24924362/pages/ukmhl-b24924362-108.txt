98 SOME REMARKS ON THE be employed, until some other blood be found which is equally congenial to the vessels. To these inferences may be added the following- remarks. It seems not improbable that animals of one genus possess the power of assimilating to their own the blood of another genus, pro- vided they live for days after it has bepn infused into their veins; as it is not easy to conceive, how life can continue for a length of time after- wards, (Experiment 16,) unless such assimilation be accomplished. Although the blood of one genus of animals cannot be injected largely into the vessels of another genus, without danger to life, it is not unlikely that small injections of this kind may be safely tried. The importance of this principle, in the operation of nourishment by transfusion, is obvious. Although an animal may be resuscitated by the transfusion of venous blood, I suspect that, of the two varieties, the arterial blood is the more efficacious; but into this enquiry I forbear to enter further at present. It is clear, from these facts and inferences, that although the blood of the mammalia may be

10 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS t When urine was injected, collapse was immedi- ately and evidently produced. 21y. Large apertures into the peritoneal sack, in the rabbit, are not necessarily, nor perhaps generally productive of fatal inflammation. Of eighteen rabbits not only opened, but subjected to further violence, five only died from this cause; (1, 2, 5, 6, 8;) the remainder, thirteen in num- ber, (3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,) either recovered, or were carried off by some other affection. As, in the eleven remaining ex- periments, a strong stimulus was applied to the peritoneum ; these, of course, are excluded from the computation. 3ly. In the rabbit, the kidney, the spleen, and a large piece of the bladder may be extirpated without necessarily causing death ; though death under the first operation is probable. Of four rabbits, all died ultimately from the renal opera- tion ; two, however, not till one or two months afterwards. Of seven rabbits, five died (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) from the splenic operation ; and of the same number only three died (15, 16, 17) from the operations on the bladder. 4ly. When the abdomen is laid open, and parts are removed from it in the rabbit, the first danger

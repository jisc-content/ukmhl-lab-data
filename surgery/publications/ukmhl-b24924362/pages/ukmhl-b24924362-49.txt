PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 39 fore, the canal of the uterus, I interrupted that of the vagina. The vagina of the doe, it has been already ob- served, is at least three inches in length; so that although it is interrupted at the uterine extre- mity, there still remains sufficient room for the male organ. Of this peculiarity I availed myself, in conducting these experiments; and instead of cutting the uterus, I cut the vagina asunder, (near to the mouth of the womb) so as completely to interrupt its canal. In other respects the ex- periment was conducted as before. This operation proved dangerous, much more so than the former; a number of the rabbits, however recovered, and admitted, without repug- nance, the approaches of the male. The result was decisive. Although the external genitals of these animals were turgid with blood, aud the sexual excitement of some was remarkably lively ; although too, in some of them, intercourse was renewed at intervals of a week or a fortnight, on the whole, as many as twenty or thirty times, not one became pregnant. Desire itself in one or two instances, seemed almost insatiable; and in the rest, though suspended by coition for a time, in the course of a few hours, or a few days at farthest, it invariably recurred.

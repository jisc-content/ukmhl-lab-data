3G PHYSIOLOGY OP GENERATION. All these fleshy fibres are animated with a very lively irritability. The mesometric muscle* changes the situation of the wombs. The wombs themselves perform a sort of peristaltic action. The vagina not only performs this action, but an additional movement, which I shall hereafter have occasion to describe. Such are the most striking characteristics of the genital system in the rabbit, those, at least, which the following experiments require me to notice. I may now proceed to the experiments themselves. The first set of experiments was instituted with a view of ascertaining whether the semen and ru- diments must have access to each other, in order that the young animal may be formed. For this purpose, an incision was made into the cavity of the belly, immediately above the wombs ; and these, together with the upper part of the vagina, were pushed through the opening. One of the wombs was then divided near its mouth, in a transverse direction, (just as a piece of intestine might be,) so as to separate it into two portions, the superior and inferior; or, as they may be de- * Is this muscle allied in function to the round ligaments of the human womb ?

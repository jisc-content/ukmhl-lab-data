38 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. uterine pregnancy, was in many instances en- larged and developed and plentifully supplied with blood, indeed it often appeared as well adapted as its fellow for receiving and cherishing the rudiments ; but with all its aptitudes for ge- neration, it lay under one capital defectâ€”its canal was interrupted ; it intercepted the access of the semen to the rudiments, and without this access generation could not be accomplished. To confirm this conclusion, the accuracy of which I doubted at the time, it was determined to submit it to the test of another train of expe- riments. In these it was my object, to preserve the principle of the preceding operation, the ex- clusion of the semen from the rudiments ; and yet at the same time, to vary its circumstances as much as possible, in order to ascertain how far they had affected the result; for I need not ob- serve, that circumstances often exert a silent and most fallacious influence over our experiments, (our negative experiments especially) to be de- precated the more, because, from its insidious nature, it is so frequently overlooked. In this second series of experiments, therefore, instead of operating upon rabbits that were full grown, I made use of those only that were under their puberty; and instead of interrupting, as be-

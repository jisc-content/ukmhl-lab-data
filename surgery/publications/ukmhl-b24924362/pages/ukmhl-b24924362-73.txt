SOME REMARKS OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. In common with many of my most intelligent friends, I have long entertained an opinion, that notwithstanding the improvements which have been already made in surgery, there are still many operations of importance which may be added to the science. Among these operations, transfusion may, I think, fairly rank as one; and it is with a view of keeping this valuable opera- tion before the profession, and in the hope of adding somewhat to the body of facts by which it may be still further illustrated, that I am in- duced again to make it the subject of a memoir. Without pretending to give an enumera- tion of all the cases in which transfusion may be tried, with a fair prospect of advantage, I may observe, that there are some cases, in which the practical utility of it is both great and obvious.

96 SOME REMARKS ON THE ferred, with any useful degree of certainty, from the dog to the human subject. 19. I once, however, laid bare the femoral vessels in a dog, and drew off, in the course of two minutes, about ten ounces of blood from the artery, by means of a pipe, which was introduced in the usual manner, with its extremity towards the heart. After the blood had been abstracted in this manner, the pulse disappeared in the op- posite limb, and the blood ceased to flow from the tube, excepting in slow drops, at long inter- vals : so that, after the experience which I have had in these experiments, I should not hesitate to assert, that, unless transfusion had been perform- ed, the animal must have died. After the dog had been suffered to lie in this state for a few seconds, I threw in, by means of the syringe, about two ounces of blood, in place of the ten, which had been taken away; when the animal was very decidedly resuscitated; re- spiration returned; the pulse became obvious; and the blood, upon slackening a ligature which had been applied, came out from the tube inserted into the femoral artery, in a pretty full stream. It appears, therefore, from this experiment, not only that blood transfused by a syringe, is capable of resuscitating an animal, but further, that a small

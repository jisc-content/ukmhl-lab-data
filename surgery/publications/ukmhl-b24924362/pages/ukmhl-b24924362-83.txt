OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 73 coagulation than the human blood. We must not therefore lightly make this inference general, nor transfer it without consideration to the human body. 41y. That although the dog cannot, perhaps, in general, be resuscitated, even a few minutes after the carotid artery has been fairly laid open, and distended by the introduction of a pipe ; and although resuscitation be improbable, if respi- ration has been suspended in consequence of bleeding, yet, now and then, recovery is possi- ble ; since, in Experiment 9, a complete resus- citation was accomplished, about twenty-five minutes after the artery had been opened, and four or five minutes after the animal had lain to appearance dead. And here it may be observed, transiently, how necessary it is not to draw conclusions hastily from a few experiments, but, on the contrary, to multiply them as much as may be, since it is by performing the same ex- periment repeatedly that important exceptions are sometimes ascertained. 51y. It follows from the preceding inferences, that if we are called to a patient fifteen or twenty minutes after the carotid artery has been laid open, the patient may be still respiring; and therefore, that resuscitation by means of trans- fusion, may not perhaps be found in every instance

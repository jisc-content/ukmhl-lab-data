130 SOME REMARKS ON THE the canine blood coagulates in one-sixth of the time which is necessary for the coagulation of human blood, as the following experiments prove; and it is clear, therefore, that in transfusing hu- man blood, coagulation can furnish no insuperable impediment. 31. I drew off, into a conical wine-glass, about three drachms of blood from â€˜the femoral artery of a dog; it began to coagulate in about 10 se- conds, and was completely solid in about 80. In a second experiment which I made, the blood began to coagulate in about 10 seconds (as be- fore), and was completely solid in about 60. 32. A patient being seized with an arterial epistaxis, I collected some of the blood of a bright florid tint. A full minute elapsed before even minute coagula made their appearance, and the blood did not become wholly solid till four or five. 33. A few drachms of venous blood were taken from the arm of a girl liable to attacks of epi- lepsy. It was full 60 seconds before even minute coagula began to make their appearance about the sides of the vessels, and six or seven minutes elapsed before a general coagulation of it took place.

If the eighth pair of nerves were divided on one side only, the recovery might be permanent; and if it were cut through on both sides, the patient might be expected to live after- wards for a few hours. 61y. In some of these experiments, in which the carotid was laid wide open, the blood, to- wards the close of the operation, came away sluggishly, and in small quantities; so that the discharge might have been arrested by the mere pressure of the finger. When persons cut their throat, I strongly suspect, that by the pressure of the finger, or, by putting a fold or two of a handkerchief into the wound, the flow of the blood might sometimes be so far obstructed, as to prolong the patientâ€™s life till further assis- tance could be obtained. If this assertion be true, it cannot be made too generally known. 71y. The preceding experiments do not enable me to decide, whether, in apparent death from bleeding, a preference should be given to the injection of blood into the jugular vein or the carotid artery; but, I think, on the whole, the blood ought to be injected into the carotid artery, toward the heart, in order, if possible; to renew the circulation through the coronary vessels, on which, I suspect, the irritability of the heart depends. But to proceed.

SOME REMARKS ON THE 106 observed to issue at length from the artery of an unusually bright arterial tint, as if it were ren- dered doubly arterial; in no other experiments have I observed this phenomenon to be so con- spicuously marked. Owing to the imperfection of the apparatus, about a drachm of air got into the veins. In consequence of some alarm and agitation the pulse intermitted before transfusion began, but during the operation these intermissions became more frequent, occurring every five or six beats, the blood flowing sometimes impetu- ously and sometimes sluggishly from the carotid artery ; towards the close of the experiment these intermissions became less frequent, and in a few minutes afterwards ceased altogether. The entrance of the air did not occasion any unusual symptoms. The intermissions of the pulse, constituting the most remarkable symp- tom, must certainly be attributed in part to alarm, for it was observed before the operation commenced ; but it seems also to have arisen partly from the unequal and impetuous stream in which the blood was thrown into the heart. It is obvious that it cannot be ascribed to the arte- rial nature of the blood which was injected into

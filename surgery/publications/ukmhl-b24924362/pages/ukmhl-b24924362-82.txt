72 SOME REMARKS ON THE \ dog, the animal very speedily becomes irrecover- able by the process of transfusion ; for it will be observed, that when the dog was suffered to be in a state of apparent death for sixty-four, (4) thirty-four, (5) twenty, (7) nay, even ten minutes, (6), it could not be resuscitated ; and this too, although in Experiments 7, 8, the operation of transfusion was assisted by the stimulus of the hot bath, and an artificial respiration very dili- gently executed. Whether this principle may or not be transferred to the human body, admits a doubt; but the affirmative is probable. 31y. That one impediment to the resuscitation of the animal in these cases, arises, perhaps, from the coagulation of the blood in the heart, for concretions were found there on inspection in Experiment 7 ;' it should be added, however, that this was ascertained to be the case, by in- spection, in one of the dogs only, for the others were not examined; and that in other animals, as, for example, the ox, the blood has been found by an excellent experimental observer, Mr. Thackrah*, to be fluid in the heart, half an hour after the animal has been knocked down : nor must it be forgotten, that the blood of the dog has a much stronger tendency to speedy * See Thackrahâ€™s Inquiry, p. 58, London, 1819; a valuable present to Physiology.

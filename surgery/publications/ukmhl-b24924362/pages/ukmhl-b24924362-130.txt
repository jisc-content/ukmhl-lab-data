SOME REMARKS ON THE 120 quet, a scalpel, a lancet, an eyed probe, a blunted needle and ligatures, a pair of spring forceps, venous tubules, a smaller and a larger, and two flexible tubes, each about six inches long, one connected with a smaller and one with a larger arterial tubule to meet the varying calibre of the vessels, and both capable of uniting, in the way of plug, with either of the venous tubules.

When, in consequence of the want of arterial blood, it becomes necessary to transfuse the ve- nous, a different method of operating must be adopted; and, in the present state of our know- ledge, I would recommend in such cases, the em- ployment of the impellor.

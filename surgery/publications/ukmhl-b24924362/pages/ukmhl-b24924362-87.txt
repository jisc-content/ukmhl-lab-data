For as this was a first essay, and not so well conducted as it might have been had I possessed more experience in the operation, instead of in- jecting the blood daily or twice a-day in quan- tities of two or three ounces only, so as not to overload the vascular system, I generally trans- fused the blood at longer intervals of one, two, and once or twice of three days; and much larger quantities of blood, eight or ten ounces at least, were thrown in together. The consequence of this large supply was such a surcharge of the vascular system as would be produced in a full- grown man by the injection of not less than three or four pints of blood into the veins, with no other preparation than a fast of one or two days.

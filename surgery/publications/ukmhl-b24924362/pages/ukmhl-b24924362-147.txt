137 OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. performed by the syringe simply, in the mode recommended (p. 127.) 39. A young man, of somewhat muscular make, a patient in Guyâ€™s Hospital, lost a large quantity of blood, from the bursting of an ar- tery, and appeared afterwards, for two or three hours together, to be evidently sinking from in- anition. This patient I was requested to see ; but in consequence of my being from home, on professional business, time was lost, and I could not perform the operation till the man had ceased to respire for three or four minutes. Assisted, however, by a surgeon of talent and enterprize, Mr. Key, I injected sixteen ounces of blood, by means of the impellor, into the bleeding vein, exposed by the lancet; but, with the exception of one single sigh, no signs of returning life were perceptible. An esteemed and intelligent pupil of. mine, Mr. Lord, furnished the blood; and there was no difficulty whatever in obtaining it by venesection as fast as the operation required. In the first of these cases, it will be observed, the syringe was used ; in the second, the impel- lor; and they prove, that in either mode, the operation is of easy performance: both, though indecisive, render it doubtful whether a man can be resuscitated by an injection into the veins,

OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 91 that was substituted, and it deserves particular re- mark, that in Leacockâ€™s experiments, the transfu- sion was not performed by the syringe, a method of operating with which he was unacquainted, but simply by the tube. From these facts it appears clearly that the human blood cannot safely be substituted in large quantities for that of the dog. It is certain that death was not produced accidentally, from the hurry of injection, or from plethora; from suffering the blood to accumulate in the cup of the syringe, or the dog, to remain too long in a state of asphyxia, for in some of the experi- ments, these accidents were carefully obviated, particularly in the last. 16. The only experiments that I know of, in which the human blood was substituted for that of the dog, by an operation similar to those de- scribed above, without destroying the animal, are those performed, six or seven years ago, by Mr. Goodridge, of Barbadoes, a gentleman who was at that time finishing his medical studies, at the united hospitals. In these experiments, pro- bably in consequence of the natural vigour of its constitution, and, perhaps, from the smaller quan- tity in which blood was injected, the animal was enabled to struggle through the consequences of

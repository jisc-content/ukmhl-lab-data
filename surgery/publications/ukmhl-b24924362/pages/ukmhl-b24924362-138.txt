SOME REMARKS ON THE 128 I rise to the upper part of the instrument, may be thoroughly expelled.. The syringe, together with the tubule springing from it, now charged with blood only, is to be slid into the vein of the patient, properly laid open for the purpose, and without delay or hurry the blood is to be in- jected in an equable stream; the operation being repeated as often as the quantity of the blood to be injected may require:—the syringe being of a known capacity will measure the blood. This, with some little improvement, was the method of operating adopted in Brazier’s case, (p. 139.) In this method also Mr. Goodrige operated on his dogs, as before described. The simplicity of the operation, and the portability of the instrument, are its great recommendation. A common syringe, if a good one, might be used in this manner if the emergency were pressing. When the syringe is charged for the first time, air may be previously expelled from the instru- ment by charging it with water. The vein must be laid thoroughly bare, as the cellular web, if not divided completely, will slip over the orifice in the vein, and obstruct the introduction of the instrument ; and the opening must be made sufficiently large and free to allow of the ready entrance of the tube. Perhaps a probe might be passed under the vein with advantage.

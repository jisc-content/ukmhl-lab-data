, SOME REMARKS ON THE the tubule towards the heart. For about half a minute the blood flowed in an impetuous stream; and then, for several minutes longer, it escaped very slowly from the tubule, which was kept clear from coagula, by the occasional introduc- tion of a stilet. The whole quantity of blood drawn, however, scarcely exceeded half a pint. At first the respiration was tolerably natural; but when the animal was pretty well emptied, it became disordered ; deep sighings frequently oc- curred, and about twenty minutes from the time when the artery was opened, (not earlier,) respira- tion stopped altogether, the pulse disappearing completely in the femoral artery; the abdominal muscles becoming very flabby; and the animal lying, to all appearance, dead.

The effects were immediate, shuddering first oc- curred, then respiration, then vascular action, and ultimately complete recovery. 1 am dis- posed to think, that the heart of some dogs is

I drained a dog from the left carotid artery, in the same manner as in the preceding expe- riment, abstracting, as usual, all the blood which could be got away. The dog continued to re- spire a little occasionally, but was evidently dying, and the circulation was stopped. After waiting a few seconds, I threw into the jugular vein, by means of the syringe, blood taken from the carotid artery of another dog ; the recovery of the animal being sudden, and on the whole complete.

I drained a young dog from the left carotid artery, in the usual manner, so that the cir- culation stopped completely, and the animal scarcely respired. Then, by means of the syringe, I injected into the left jugular vein blood taken from the ar- teries ol another dog, with the effect of com-

OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 109 â€¢ end of the experiment exhibiting the arterial characteristics in a higher degree than ordinary. After waiting about half an hour I performed the transfusion for eight minutes longer; and then pausing another half-hour, I operated a third time also for eight minutes, a few small con- cretions forming on this occasion in the cup: so that transfusion was carried on altogether for about twenty-four minutes, the blood flowing freely during the whole time. Assuming there- fore, what had indeed been ascertained by the preceding experiment, I mean, that in the course of two minutes about half a pint of blood came away from the femoral artery when kept open by the tube, twelve pounds of blood, at least, must have been transmitted through the instrument; and the same blood must of consequence have passed the syringe repeatedly, for the whole weight of the dog did not equal twelve pounds; and this conclusion is confirmed by the highly arterial character which the blood had acquired when the operation concluded. After remaining languid for a day or two, this dog recovered like the former. In the progress of this experiment, made with greater dexterity than the preceding, it is re- markable that very little derangement of the system occurred. The respiration was indeed a I

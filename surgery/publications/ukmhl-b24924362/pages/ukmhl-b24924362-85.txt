OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 75 The formation of blood is the principal end of the chylopoietic viscera, and of their auxiliaries ; and it seems, therefore, not improbable, in those cases in which the action of these viscera is in- terrupted by schirrosity of the pylorus, or other causes, that their operations might be superseded by the injection of blood into the veins, so as to supply the vessels in a direct manner with that blood, which in health is the result of sanguifica- tion. As, however, opinions derived from rea- sonings of this kind are exceedingly uncertain, until they are brought to the test of experience, I have been induced to institute an experiment, not unattended with labour, with a view of de- monstrating that dogs certainly may be supported for a length of time by the transfusion of blood only, without the aid of food taken into the ali- mentary tube; and the following is a brief state- ment of the results. For three whole weeks I nourished a clog by the mere transfusion of blood into the ex- ternal jugular vein. The aggregate quantity in- lusecl during this period, was eighty-four ounces, avoirdupois, nearly ; that is, on an average, four ounces a-day; and during the whole time the animal was allowed to swallow nothing except water, and, indeed, never manifested any marked desiie for solid aliment.

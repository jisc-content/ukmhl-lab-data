56 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. duction of the semen at the opening, it is need- less to explain. The mere performance of it fur- nishes no contemptible argument in proof of that approach of the semen to the rudiments for which I have been contending. Before I close these observations (already per- haps too diffuse) I cannot forbear adverting to some other points of the genital physiology, which they may contribute to illustrate. It has been asserted by some naturalists, that the corpus luteum is an evidence of genuine im- pregnation. It seems certain, however, from the facts related, that this evidence cannot be relied on ; for the luteum, in these experiments, was generated under circumstances in which, as the event proved, impregnation was impossible. In- deed there seems to be little reason for doubting, that the corpus luteum may be produced, even independently of the sexual intercourse, by the mere excitement of desire in a very high degree. Mr. Saumarez has recounted experiments, in his “ New System of Physiology,” in which the lu- teum appears to have been generated in this very manner. I have now in my possession a prepara- tion, (for which I stand indebted to Dr. Cholmeley and Mr. Callaway,) consisting of the ovaries of a young girl, that died of chorea, under seventeen

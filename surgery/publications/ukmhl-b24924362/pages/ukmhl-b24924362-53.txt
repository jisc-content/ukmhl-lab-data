PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 43 liberated, and moving out of opposition with each other, may not reunite so as to form anew a con- tinuous canal. If, on the contrary, (as in the se- cond scheme of experiments,) the vagina be di- vided, a ligature should,be applied to the orifice of that piece of it which remains annexed to the womb, and the ligature should be fastened to the margin of the external wound. This precaution ensures the escape of the thread*, and at the same time prevents the pieces of the vagina from falling into opposition, and renewing the conti- nuity of the canal. When the genitals are mature, the rabbit very frequently dies from this operation, which, in consequence of the large size of the vagina, is more violent than the former. It is better, there- fore, on this account, as well as for reasons already assigned, to operate before puberty. Previously to this change the parts are compara- tively small, and the interruption of the vagina In operating upon the viscera of small animals, I have occa- sionally used a very slender ligature, have cut it short, and left it. In two rabbits, which had apparently recovered after the vagina had been tied in this manner, a general inflammation of the belly came on about six months afterwards, in the winter, when the health of the animals was impaired by the severity of the season. On inspection aftei death, it was found, that the ligature still adhered to the vagina, and it seemed to form the centre from which the inflammation had spread.

40 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. The same general appearances were observed on dissection, in them all. The vagina, if the operation had been properly performed, was com- pletely interrupted. In both the ovaries there were corpora lutea. In some cases, the wombs ap- peared to have undergone little change; in others, they were very much enlarged, and evolved as completely as in actual pregnancy; but in no one instance was there the appearance of a single ovum, extra-uterine or in the womb. In these, as in the preceding experiments, though in a different manner, the access of the semen to the rudiments had been intercepted, and under these circumstances, notwithstanding repeated com- merce with the male, the formation of the young animal could not be accomplished. In performing the experiments recorded in the preceding paragraphs, there are various little niceties in the mode of operating, the observance of which is necessary to ensure success. The incision which is carried through the abdominal coverings, may be made in the linea alba, and should be eight or ten lines, at least, in length, in order that the parts may be replaced with facility. It should, too, lie as close to the sym- vhysis pubis as possible, that the intestines, which in this herbivorous animal are numerous and cumbersome, may not, as they are apt to do

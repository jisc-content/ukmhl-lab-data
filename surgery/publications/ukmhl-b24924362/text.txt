Of^II the Branches of Surgery there is none, I conceive, which in this country admits of greater improvement than the Surgery of the Abdomen, the great importance of which it is unnecessary to enforce. With a view to this improvement it is, that I have been induced to accumulate the following Facts and Observations ; and in lay- ing them before the Profession it may be proper to remark, that where there is no observation to the contrary, I can vouch for their being substan- tially correct. * As this abstract was made several months after the reading of the Paper before the Medico-Chirurgical Society, and as some of the Rabbits died in that interval, the' results and inferences here stated do not correspond exactly with the inferences and results as stated in that Paper. B 24 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS In four experiments the left kidney was taken out of the rabbit, through an incision upon the outer edge of it, about an inch long, very large for the bulk of the animal: the kidney was drawn up through the wound, and the superior half of the peritoneal attachment, thus put on the stretch, was, together with the vessels, included in the ligature. The rabbits were of a spare habit, and were all under their full size, as they had not reached their puberty. Of these animals, 1. The first died about sixty hours after the extirpation, with inflammation of the abdomen. * t 2. The second died about four and a half days after the operation, with the same disease strongly characterized. 3. The third rabbit recovered, lived for five or six weeks and then died, from a cause which ill- health prevented me from exploring. 4. And the fourth also for a short time recover- ed, fattened, and grew, but at the end of five or six weeks it died in like manner, with a sack in the seat of the extirpated kidney, formed by the peritoneum, and filled with a semi-fluid, in colour and consistency like custard; the cyst was not burst; the remaining kidney was, I think, enlarged;5 AND EXPERIMENTS. the spleen was black, the liver was dark, the kidney was rather pale. In seven experiments I took out the spleen; four of the rabbits were of spare habit, and of the same size with the former, and three of them were full-grown bucks, with the omentum, kid- ney and other parts well loaded with fat. Of the full-grown buck rabbits, i 5. The first died about three complete days after the operation, with abdominal inflamma- tion. 6. The second died about four days complete after the operation, with well-marked inflamma- tion of the peritoneum, as in the preceding case. 7. The third recovered for a time, and seemed likely to survive, but three months and a half after the operation, it died with a diffused peri- tonitis, and a large sack between the left portion of the liver and stomach, as big as a large orange, and full of a fluid like whey and custard mixed. Of the smaller rabbits, 8. The first died five complete days after the operation, with purging and inflammation of the peritoneum.6 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS 9. The second recovered for a time, but at the end of six months began to pine away gradually, like the former (7), and died ultimately with in- flammation of the abdomen, effusion of coagulable lymph, firm adhesions, and a cyst in the region of the spleen, as large as the kidney of the animal, and full of a thin pus. JO, 11. And the remaining two recovered permanently. In five rabbits I opened the abdominal cavity- over the bladder to the extent of half an inch, in the course of the tinea alba, punctured the fundus vesica with a lancet, and secured the aperture by ligature. Of these rabbits, 12, 13, 14. Three recovered completely, and were killed for inspection ; and two died. 15, 16. One of them, fourteen days after the operation, with the external wound unclosed; the other, seventeen days after the operation. Both were a good deal emaciated, and there were no decisive marks of peritoneal inflammation. In two experiments on rabbits under the adult size, I cut off at least one quarter of the bladder at the fundus, with one stroke of the scissors; a ligature had been previously applied.I and experiments. 7 17. One of these rabbits died seven months af- terwards, full grown, and not obviously cachectic, with one of the purulent sacks already described seated internally, immediately over the abdo- minal wound. 18. The second rabbit is alive still, and appears large, fat, and healthy. Into the peritoneum of four rabbits I threw about an ounce of human urine, of a full yellow colour ; left it there for an hour; then discharged it, and washed out the peritoneum thoroughly, by injecting tepid water. They all suffered much collapse from this experiment; and while the urine remained in the abdomen among the viscera, they dragged the hinder legs after them, as if slightly paralytic: the injection of the tepid water seemed to soothe them. Of these rabbits, 19. The first, a fat buck, never recovered , from a state of collapse, and died in less than twenty-four hours after the experiment. The peritoneum exhibited no obvious marks of in- flammation. 20. The second, also a fine fat buck, died in sixty hours, in part, at least, from peritoneal inflammation; there was purging. The inflam- mation seemed greatest nearest the wound.8 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS 21. The, third, a rabbit under the full size, of spare habit, was destroyed in nineteen hours, with the most diffused and active peritonitis I ever saw in this animal. In this last rabbit I found small chrystals of urinary salt, scattered all over the peritoneum, from which the urine had been too negligently washed out. 22. The fourth rabbit, also under the full size, recovered completely ; and is now, twelve months after the experiment, large, fat, and to all appear- ance perfectly well. ,y- b-J l 'I'Jf.i-' . ' oil:' >vr bnr, ,t.. In seven experiments, I injected into the peri- toneahsack, eleven drachms of the decoctum quercus, Pharmacopoeice Londinensis; the rabbits were under the full size and spare. Of these rabbits, . • jr r ( j, > . rf . * ^ , '’• •i-' * OJ VJ i .i 23. One died in fifteen hours, with purging ; and, I think, a diffused peritonitis in the inci- pient state. The extractive of the bark was found lying about in the peritoneum. The intes- tines were tympanitic 24. 25, 26, 27, 28. Five others died, between twenty and thirty hours after the injection, ap- parently from the same cause : 29. And one got completely well9 AND EXPERIMENTS. In experiments 27, 28, 29, the decoction was of the full strength ; in experiments 23, 25, 26, it was reduced to half strength ; and in expe- riment 24, to a strength of one-third; it was therefore of the full strength in the rabbit that recovered. The rapidity with which death ensued in these experiments, deserves particular notice. The peritouitic inflammation, which I have had repeated occasion to mention, in giving the results of these experiments, was marked, in the more decisive instances, by serous effusion; by accumulation of adhesive matter ; by the aggluti- nation of the different viscera to each other, and the peritoneum; and, in some of the rabbits, by a thorough injection of the smaller vessels (on the large intestines especially) with blood, so that they exhibited a petechial appearance. From the facts ascertained by the preceding experiments, the following inferences may, 1 think, be fairly drawn :— * » - ... \ , < f;.- ... «. 1st. Large apertures into the peritoneum of the rabbit do not .immediately induce a dangerous prostration of strength. In all my experiments, I never once observed any marked collapse in the animal at the moment when the peritoneum was laid open, though I was in full expectation of it.10 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS t When urine was injected, collapse was immedi- ately and evidently produced. 21y. Large apertures into the peritoneal sack, in the rabbit, are not necessarily, nor perhaps generally productive of fatal inflammation. Of eighteen rabbits not only opened, but subjected to further violence, five only died from this cause; (1, 2, 5, 6, 8;) the remainder, thirteen in num- ber, (3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,) either recovered, or were carried off by some other affection. As, in the eleven remaining ex- periments, a strong stimulus was applied to the peritoneum ; these, of course, are excluded from the computation. 3ly. In the rabbit, the kidney, the spleen, and a large piece of the bladder may be extirpated without necessarily causing death ; though death under the first operation is probable. Of four rabbits, all died ultimately from the renal opera- tion ; two, however, not till one or two months afterwards. Of seven rabbits, five died (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) from the splenic operation ; and of the same number only three died (15, 16, 17) from the operations on the bladder. 4ly. When the abdomen is laid open, and parts are removed from it in the rabbit, the first danger11 AND EXPERIMENTS. arises apparently from collapse, (19); the second from general inflammation, (1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28); and the last from chro- nic topical disease, (4, 7, 19, 17.) 51y. The rabbit’s abdomen is very tender, pro- bably no less so than that of man. Of twenty- nine rabbits, twenty-one died more or less direct- ly from the operations performed, some of them, it must be confessed, violent ones; and it should be observed particularly, that five, out of seven rab- bits, died from the splenic operation carefully performed; though both cases, hereafter recorded, in which the human spleen was removed, under circumstances to appearance highly unfavourable, terminated in complete and uninterrupted re- covery. The general impression left on my mind by many observations is, that the abdomen of the rabbit is, on the whole, no less tender than the human. 61y. It follows, from the former inference, that success in abdominal operations on the rabbit, furnishes a presumption in favour of success in similar operations on the human abdomen; and therefore, from these experiments, we may infer presumptively that moderate openings into the hu- ' man peritoneum will not necessarily, nor even generally, prove fatal from inflammation or other-12 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS wise; and, further, that certain viscera or parts of viscera, not essential to the welfare of our struc- ture, may be removed from the belly without ne- cessarily, or even generally producing death. The extirpation of the kidney must be highly dan- gerous ; but there is a presumption in favour of the successful removal of the spleen, the ovaries, or even of large pieces of the bladder. But to proceed to observations on the human body. Of slighter injuries of the abdomen, it is un- necessary to make a large enumeration. Tap- pings, slight wounds in which the intestines are not laid open, hernial operations with extirpa- tion of small pieces of the omentum, and in Mr. Pott’s case of both the ovaries, in general con- fessedly do well; and where death occurs, after the operation of hernia especially, it is some- times rather referable to some accidental con- comitant, as delay, for example, than to any thing of necessity emanating from the nature of the operation itself. „ «. <^uo ii■ v *-»*.* ^ >. » .'!• Of severer injuries of the abdomen, with their results, the following may be adduced as having, with few exceptions, fallen under my own no- tice, or that of my friends; and, as possessing an authenticity, on which, where there is no ob- servation to the contrary, I can thoroughly rely. These, as it will be perceived, so far as theyAND EXPERIMENTS. 13 furnish inferences at all, confirm those taken from experiments on the rabbit; and form, ap- parently, a part of one harmonious system of facts, which mutually support each other. 30. —1st. One case, the only one I know of, in which the mouth of the womb was torn off, and came completely away; large bleeding and col- lapse were produced, but the patient recovered. My friend, Mr. Scott of Norwich, carefully inves- tigated this case, and Dr. Merriman of London is now, I believe, in possession of the preparation. * \ _ 31. —21y. One case, in which, from defective formation of the external genitals, the child’s head could not readily pass : it forced its way into the rectum, and was born at the anus, occasioning three large rents, two laterally, and one forward; the woman recovered without any very pressing symptom. Mr. Harrison of Greenwich, had the woman ultimately under his own care; and him- self, in conjunction with my friend Mr. Gaitskell, obliged me with the relation of it. 31y. Four cases of chronic inversion of the womb, in which the uterus ivas extirpated by li- gature, at different ages. ■' i .. j \' i i > - , 1 • ' y}' * 32. One, a case under the care of Mr. Chevalier. The woman in this instance was, I think, about14 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS sixty; and for years previously had ceased to men- struate : no bad symptoms seem to have occurred. 33. The second, a case under the care of Mr. Newnham. The woman was about twenty-four. Some difficulties arose from the extreme irrita- bility of the patient, but the greater part of the womb was got away. The preparation of the womb I saw myself. The womau is still doing well, and it is now six or seven years since the operation was performed. 34. The third, a case in which Dr. Hull of Man- Chester operated. The patient was excessively irritable and intractable, and some difficulties oc- curred as in the former instance, but the opera- tion succeeded. Dr. Hull himself related this case to me in a conversation between us. 35. The fourth, a case of my own, in which the greater part of the womb was removed by a wire ligature. It came away in eleven days. This patient was of a tranquil torpid habit; and not one bad symptom occurred. 36. —41y. One case has fallen under my obser- vation, in which a fall from the top of a coach occasioned a transverse rent through the abdo- minal coverings, above the abdominal rings, on the right side, four fingers broad at the least.15 AND EXPERIMENTS. The intestines hung out. The man recovered in a few weeks. The intestines still protrude at this part, pushing the abdominal coverings before them, and forming a ventral hernia. The scar of the rent is still apparent. The man was under the care of Mr. Green, one of the surgeons of St. Thomas’s Hospital. 51y. Two cases, (may be mentioned,) the only ones within my knowledge, in which the human spleen was removed. 37. One that of the soldier whose side was laid open by a sabre wound at the battle of Det- tingen, (if my memory serve,) the spleen pro- truding and lying out for some hours in the dirt. It was removed by the surgeon. The man re- covered, and seemed to suffer afterwards no in- convenience referable to the want of the spleen. Mr. Cline used to relate this case. 38. A second, that recorded by Dr. O’Brien in his inaugural dissertation.* The case was under his own personal care. The man was a native of Mexico : the spleen lay out for two days before the surgeon was applied to: the bleeding was profuse : the vessels and other connexions were * Edinburgh, 1818.16 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS secured by ligature, and the spleen separated completely from the body on the twentieth day of the wound. On the forty-fifth day the man was discharged from the hospital, cured; and observed to some one about this time, that “ he felt as well as ever he did in his life.” There was bloody urine till the tenth day, (the only bad symptom which occurred during his recovery,) the kidney having most probably received a wound at the time when the side was laid open. Sly. Three cases may be cited, in which the dropsical ovary was rent, probably extensively, from external violence; they are all that have been brought under my notice, and all terminated favourably. For the full authenticity of the fol- \ lowing I pledge myself: 39. An unmarried lady, with dropsical ovary, was thrown on the ground with violence, from a two-wheeled carriage, and struck the enlarged abdomen with considerable force against a stone which lay by the road side. A large discharge of urine followed ; she became permanently freed from her dropsy; and rrfarrying, died with a retroversion of the' womb, which could not be replaced. On inspection, the remains of a rup- tured ovarian cyst were discovered, retroverting the uterus, which was fixed firmly in the retro-AND EXPERIMENTS. 17 verted position, by means of inflammatory adhe- sions. 40. This case, which may be relied on as au- thentic, gives additional probability to one related by the late Dr. Kissam, of New York, who was a fellow student of Mr. Gaitskell at Edin- burgh, and much esteemed for his activity and talent. In this, as in the former instance, the lady had an ovarian dropsy of many years stand- ing, clearly distinguishable through the abdomi- nal coverings. No abscess occurring, for several days afterwards, a trocar and canula were in- troduced into the peritoneal sack, and twenty-six pints of bloody serum were drawn off; the patient, notwithstanding the double injury from the rent and operation, getting well without any alarming symptoms. (New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery, Vol. v. p. 225.J 41. The third case deserves notice, especially as corroborated by the two former, which it resem- bles. There was swelling in the region of the right ovary, equable, smooth and without distin- guishable fluctuation; pain shot occasionally in the course of the round ligament down the thigh; the left limb first, and afterwards the right, be- came oedematous ; the general health was little impaired. When straining to reach something c18 PHYSIOLOOICAL OBSERVATIONS on a high shelf, the patient felt some part give way within her, and examining herself immedi- ately afterwards, she discovered that the circum- scribed tumour was disappeared, and that there was general abdominal swelling in its place. For a length of time afterwards she seemed to be re- covering from this injury, and died, with a schir- rus of the uterine organs, and not, as appeared, from the accident. (Idem.) 61y. May be narrated, two cases, in which an opening was made into the abdomen, with a view of extirpating the dropsical ovary. 42. In the first, the operation failed com- pletely. The woman had never been tapped; the ovary held about a pailful; a schirrous piece, as large at least as the hand, not easily removed, was left in the belly; great collapse occurred, directly the ovarian sack was drawn forth, before it was cut into; but the woman lived between eighty and ninety hours afterwards, without the occurrence of peritoneal inflamma- tion, and died, apparently, from the cachexy produced by the dropsy, and for want of reaction in the system and the wound. 43. In the second case, the ovarian cyst was extirpated by Dr. Nathan Smith, formerly, I beAND EXPERIMENTS. 19 lieve, of Connecticut. (See American Medical Rc- corder of original Papers and Intelligence in Medicine and Surgery, No.ll.) The sack contained about eight pints; there were no adhesions of extent and importance; the, natural connexion of the ovary was as large as a finger, and the patient got well without a bad symptom*. Dr. Nathan Smith is well known to some gentlemen now in London, and would, I have little doubt, if this were deemed necessary for the sake of science, give proof convincing to the most sceptical of the authenticity of this case. These are the only thita^operations that I at present know of, coming so immediately under my notice, as to justify citation; at the first I was myself present. I question much whether, in the first operations of lithotomy and amputation, the proportion of re- coveries was so great as one in two. 7ly. May be mentioned five cases of laceration in the womb or vagina, occurring during parturi- tion, all of which were ultimately brought under my personal notice, though in one case only was I present when the accident occurred. 44. In the first, the child was born alive by * I quote from my adversaria, as I have not been able to lay my hand on the original in time for the press. C 220 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS the natural efforts, and the side of the womb was torn longitudinally, where it unites with the broad ligaments; the woman sinking, of conse- quence, from flooding. I was requested to in- spect the body; the rupture of the womb had not even been suspected during her life. 45. In the second case, the vagina, or neck of the womb, was lacerated behind, to the extent of a large hand breadth; the peritoneum being laid open, a clot of blood as big as the hand was found, after death, in the abdomen; collapse oc- curred, the patient never rallying thoroughly, though she lived for thirty-six hours. 46. The third case resembled the former; the woman died collapsed in about thirty-eight hours; there was, however, more reaction than in the for- mer case. 47. In the fourth case the womb was torn in front, and the child escaped into the belly; the bladder was not injured. Collapse occurred in this case, and death took place in less than twelve hours. 48. The womb was torn in front in the fifth case also; the child as before escaping into the peritoneal sack. I brought this fetus away byAND EXPERIMENTS. 21 turning; had my hand among the intestines and on the edge of the liver ; felt the large arteries in the back of the abdomen, and grasped gently the empty and contracted womb. The child was brought away dead; the woman recovered pretty completely in the course of four or five weeks, but has never been in a state of robust health since. Her name was Casey; she lived near St. George’s church, Southwark; and before her recovery was complete, she came, for greater conveniency, into Guy’s Hospital. A few months back, (i. e. five or six years after the accident;) I made a careful examination, when no traces of cicatrix were discoverable in the vagina, and the mouth of the womb felt perfectly sound and natural, so that there can, I think, be no doubt that the parts had been torn through above. Sly. Every one knows the formidable nature of the Cesarian operation, and the very unfavourable circumstances under which it has generally been performed in this country. By a friend of the late Dr. Haighton, however, it has been done three times; once successfully, when the abdo- minal wound was healed completely by the sixth day, and the woman was able to stir about in her house on the thirteenth day; the con- stitution was in this case sound, the contraction of the pelvis having been produced by a local22 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS cause, viz. fracture of the ossa innominata: the other two cases terminated fatally. Both the latter were performed on very unhealthy subjects; and there was malacosteon. I have been in- duced to notice these three operations, because, from Mr. Barlow’s acquaintance with my valued relative, they have been brought in a manner under my immediate notice. f/J Such is the small collection of facts, favourable and unfavourable, which, with limited opportuni- ties, I have been able gradually to accumulate in the course of the last five or six years; and which to me seem calculated to throw some ad- ditional light on the probable success of a more enlarged abdominal surgery. From these, few as they are, I feel conscious that no certain in- ference can yet be drawn, though presumptive inferences certainly may, and they seem to me to be the following: 1st. That smaller wounds of the peritoneum, as in tapping, hernia, &c. do not in general induce fatal peritonitis, or other destructive effects ; and, therefore, that the common opinion, not perhaps found on paper, but frequently urged in conver- sation, and apparently operative in practice, I mean, that inflammation in a spot of the perito- neum, will almost invariably diffuse itself overand experiments. 23 the greater part of it, is probably unfounded in truth. 2ly. That extensive divisions of the peritoneum are certainly not of necessity fatal, whether by inflammation or otherwise; and probably not generally so. Sly. That the womb, spleen, and ovaries may be taken away in the mode mentioned, certainly without of necessity destroying life, and pre- sumptively without generally destroying it. 41y. That the womb, when developed from pregnancy, may be torn open; that the child may escape into the peritoneal sack, among the viscera ; and that the mouth of the womb may be torn off, not indeed, so far as these cases may be relied on, without great danger, but twice, in seven instances, without death. . i . . 51y. And generally, that the peritoneum and abdominal viscera, though very tender in the human body, will, without fatal consequences, bear more injury, than, from their modes of prac- tice, the British surgeons, especially, seem dis- posed to admit. 61y. That all the above inferences, from obser-24 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS vations on the human abdomen, are in unison with those drawn from observations on the rabbit, the one set of inferences mutually supporting the other; and in this we have a fact corroborative of the principle for which I have contended else- where, that observation on the brute and human subject, when made with caution, may, perhaps, be found more in correspondence with each other, than some surgeons are disposed, at present, to admit. A contrary opinion, so far as it is errone- ous, must exert a very baleful influence upon the progress of surgery. Whilst the body of facts which have reference to abdominal injuries remains so small, it would, no doubt, be the extreme of rashness, on such authority, to recommend to practice any opera- tions as yet untried, or of rare performance, unless indeed in those cases in which they secure the only remaining chance of life. As, however, the facts related evidently create a suspicion, that a bolder abdominal surgery would not be unattended with success, I may be pardoned, perhaps, for endea- vouring, on this occasion, to draw the notice of the profession to the following operations, all to appearance, feasible, though by no means, all of equal promise; stating distinctly, at the same time, that my design at present, is to recom-and experiments. 25 mend them to consideration merely, and not to 'practice, except as observed above in cases other- wise desperate. 1st. A division of both the fallopian tubes, and even the removal of a small piece of them, so as to render them completely impervious, a ft addition, apparently, to the Cesarian operation, the danger of which it would scarcely increase.—The effect of this operation would be to prevent subsequent impregnation, without, however, destroying the sexual propen- sities, or the menstrual action of the womb ; and as many, besides Mr. Barlow’s patient, have, on the Continent, recovered from the Cesarian ope- ration, the possibility of a second need for it should, I think, by all means be precluded. In those cases, also, of contracted pelvis, in which, notwithstanding the excitement of parturition in the seventh month, it is still necessary to destroy the children, by opening the head, and reducing their size, in order to bring them down through the pelvis, I think it would not be amiss to adopt this operation in order to produce sterility. An opening, two fingers broad, might be made above the symphysis pubis, near the linea alba; the fallopian tubes might be drawTn up to this opening one after the other, and a piece of the tube might then be taken out. This operation,26 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS much less dangerous than a delivery by perfo- rating the head when the pelvis is highly contract- ed, may, I think, be safely recommended. 2ly. The extirpation of the healthy ovaries.—This operation, even granting it to be safe, can scarcely in any instance be necessary, though it may be observed, by the way, that it would probably be found an effectual remedy in the worst cases of dyomenorrhcea, and in bleeding from monthly determination on the inverted womb, where the extirpation of this organ was rejected. •» 31 y. The extirpation of the ovarian cyst in schir- rus, combined with dropsy or in simple dropsy.—This operation will, I am persuaded, ultimately come into general use, and if the British surgeons will not patronize and perform it, the French and American surgeons will. If the dropsical cyst be large and of long standing, the removal will most probably be prevented by extensive adhe- sions ; but if the cyst be small, containing (as in Nathan Smith’s case) a few pints only, the adhe- sions will most probably be few and easily de- tached. It remains to be ascertained, by observa- tion, to what extent adhesions in the abdomen may be cut through, without danger to life. 41y. The removal of a large circular piece of the27 AND EXPERIMENTS. cyst in ovarian dropsy, when the sack itself cannot be extirpated.—As rupture of the ovary has cured the disease apparently, by laying the cyst open, and, perhaps, by inducing inflammation, advantage might be expected from this operation, at least as a palliative, though other cysts would no doubt, in many instances, gradually renew the disease. 51y. The removal of the cancerous womb, when the ulceration first makes its appearance.—Might not the womb be taken out above the symphysis pubis, or through the outlet of the pelvis ? If above the symphysis pubis, might not the head of the vagina be tied up, and might not the liga- ture be conveyed by needle, into the vagina, so as to hang out at the pudenda? All the parts about the cancerous womb, and the vagina among the rest, are in such a diseased state, that I expect little from this operation, unless early per- formed ; and then, perhaps, Ozianders’ operation of paring away the diseased surface of the ulcer might be preferable, but, I think the propriety of extirpating the womb in these cases ought certainly not to be lost sight of. />/ 61y. Extirpation of the puerperal uterus.—When the Cesarian operation is performed, or when a patient is evidently sinking after rupture of the womb, let it be remembered, that the wound '#4 f .... / f7 Ss /Ac* 6a?. r28 PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS formed by the extirpation of the womb, and which might, probably, be much reduced in ex- tent by drawing the parts together with a liga- ture, would merely take place of a more for- midable wound, that, I mean, formed in the womb by the Cesarian operation, and which by the operation here performed, would, together with the uterus, be taken completely out of the body. No operation, perhaps, can be more unpromis- ing, shall I say more unjustifiable in the present state of our knowledge, but I thought it proper to mention it. Experiment on animals, rabbits for example, which have very large wombs, might be of use here: the inverted womb has been four times extirpated with success, when reduced to the original dimensions, 32, 33, 34, 35. 71y. Should the bladder give way into the peri- toneal sack, and I have two preparations of this accident, why should we not lay open the abdo- men, tie up the bladder, discharge the urine, and wash out the peritoneum, thoroughly by the in- jection of warm water ? This operation would secure a chance of life, if the urine had not been extravasated long, say above half an hour. 81y. Small openings, with callous edges, through the neck of the bladder into the vagina, are cured29 AND EXPERIMENTS. in France, (as I learn from Mr. Travers) by the . actual cautery. When the opening is large it may probably be closed by ligature, without a bad symptom. Mr. Preston, one of my pupils, first suggested to me this operation. 91y. The injection of astringent into the perito- neum, or into ovarian cyst, has been proposed, in cases of dropsy, to check the exhalation. The ex- periments related, give little encouragement to the trial of this operation, at least, with the oak bark; or rather, in the present state of our knowledge, they render it altogether unjustifiable. lOly. In cases of strongly characterized intro- susception, though there never, perhaps, can be demonstrative proof of the disease, why should we not make an opening into the peritoneum, when every other remedy has failed, and gently pass the small intestines, fold by fold, through the fin- gers ? In the dog and the rabbit, (the latter animal has a tender belly and a large mass of intestines) I have repeatedly done this without occasioning death, or even producing extensive and danger- ous inflammation. Illy. In the rabbit I have often tied an abdomi- nal artery, and then carried the ligature out of the30 \> \r V v PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS abdomen, at the point where the artery lay, by means of a broad pointed needle, instead of draw- ing the thread forth at the wound. In operating on the human body, would this expedient be ad- vantageous, should further experience lead us to wish the ligature in all cases removed? I have, once or twice, weeks after operating, found the remains of a ligature which had been cut short, lying in the middle of a sack of puriform matter, and, to appearance laying the foundation of chronic disease. v P.

J&aS/ytne, m /A^ Af/f, / & 6? . ^ ^ _ ‘ ^A^^A /s> .- shz*t_H*£A Among tfie various^q-fieslions which have been raised respecting the generation of animals, there is one, as yet undecided, which has not perhaps been hitherto investigated with all the care it deserves. It may be demonstrated by experiment, that, in this curious process, the male furnishes the semen, and the female the ru- diments ; but whether these two substances must have access to each other, in order that the young- animal may be formed, is a question which still admits of dispute. It is true, indeed, that many naturalists have assarted, that contact is necessary ; and Spallanzani has even gone so far as to de- monstrate that it certainly takes place in the generation of the frog and toad. Still, however, notwithstanding the labours of physiologistsPHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 33 hitherto, we are not, I believe, as yet in posses- sion of any regular system of experiments, which proves that the semen must have access to the rudiments, in those forms of brute generation which most nearly resemble our own. In the present state of our knowledge, the reverse of this position seems, at least, not improbable, as the experiments of Dr. Haighton, a valued rela- tive of mine, , have shewn, that evidences of generation may be produced in the ovaries, al- though the semen has been excluded, previously to sexual intercourse, by the closure of the fallo- pian tube. The principal object of this memoir, which I had formerly the honour of presenting to the Medico- Chirurgical Society, is to contribute some little towards the supply of this defect. In it I have endeavoured to shew, that the semen must have access to the rudiments, in order that the young animal may be produced ; and yet, that genera- tion, although these approaches are necessary for its completion, may, to a certain extent, be ac- complished without them. As the rabbit was the animal, on account of its natural aptitudes, selected for my experiments, it may be proper, perhaps, before I enter on the recital of them, to premise a few remarks on it« r>34 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. genital system*. In the fallopian tubes, and ova- ries, and, I may add, the external genitals of the doe, there is little, when we view the organs as they are suspended in the glass, to attract the at- tention of the observer. It is different, however, with the vagina and the wombs ; these are so strongly contrasted with the corresponding parts of the human organs, the wombs, by their tubular form, and the vagina by its length, its laxity, and the largeness of its diameter, that they cannot be overlooked. The vagina, when full grown, is about four inches long, and so capacious that, without much stretching, it will readily admit the extremity of the fore-finger. Its size, indeed, is so consider- able, that it makes an approach to that of the hu- man vagina, and greatly exceeds the dimensions of the same canal in a moderate-sized monkey, preserved in the obstetric museum at Guy’s Hospital. The wombs, the structure of which is scarcely less remarkable than that of the vagina, are two tubular organs, when unimpregnated, about three inches and a half long and about two lines and a * It is scarcely necessary to remark that this description is not addressed to those who have made a study of comparative anatomy.PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 35 half in their diameter; they are therefore, it is obvious, very unlike the human uterus, and rather resemble that of several of our domesticated ani- mals, as the cat, for instance, the bitch, and the females of the rat and mouse tribe. These two wombs, it should be further remarked, communi- cate with the vagina by two distinct orifices; and they are so completely independent of each other, that the one may be removed without injury to the other, excepting a slight and superficial wound of that part where their necks lie in contact, and cohere. Both the wombs and the vagina are, in these animals, furnished with longitudinal and annular fibres of a muscular structure, similar in kind to those of the intestines, but grosser and more dis- tinct. In addition to these, along the inner mar- gin of the wombs, from one extremity to the other, there runs a broad strip of fleshy fibres, which may, perhaps, not improperly be denomi- nated the mesometric. I give the muscle this name, because it covers no inconsiderable por- tion of what may be called the mesometry; a de- licate double membrane, the production of the peritoneum, which performing, for the tubular wombs, the office of a mesentery, unites them, like the intestines, to the spine. It is allied to the broad ligaments of the human womb. d 23G PHYSIOLOGY OP GENERATION. All these fleshy fibres are animated with a very lively irritability. The mesometric muscle* changes the situation of the wombs. The wombs themselves perform a sort of peristaltic action. The vagina not only performs this action, but an additional movement, which I shall hereafter have occasion to describe. Such are the most striking characteristics of the genital system in the rabbit, those, at least, which the following experiments require me to notice. I may now proceed to the experiments themselves. The first set of experiments was instituted with a view of ascertaining whether the semen and ru- diments must have access to each other, in order that the young animal may be formed. For this purpose, an incision was made into the cavity of the belly, immediately above the wombs ; and these, together with the upper part of the vagina, were pushed through the opening. One of the wombs was then divided near its mouth, in a transverse direction, (just as a piece of intestine might be,) so as to separate it into two portions, the superior and inferior; or, as they may be de- * Is this muscle allied in function to the round ligaments of the human womb ?PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 37 signated from the annexed parts, the vaginal and fallopian. After this division the organs were im- mediately replaced, and the wound was sewed up. Notwithstanding this violence, in the course of a few days, or a few weeks at farthest, most of the rabbits recovered their health, and at dif- ferent intervals became fit for the approaches of the male. But though the general health was restored, the recovery was not complete. The operation, as subsequent dissection proved, had the effect of interrupting the canal of the womb, its tubular cavity growing up at the line of di- vision, so that the communication between the vaginal and fallopian pieces became intercepted, and the semen and the rudiments could have no access to each other. In this condition of the genitals, as soon as the sexual ardour was rekindled, the animals were submitted to the male; and, excepting in one or two anomalous instances, out of ten or twelve experiments, they all became pregnant from the Jirst admissions. At different periods from im- pregnation the sexual organs were examined after death with great care and deliberation, when young animals were invariably found in the sound womb, but none in the interrupted. This, it is true, like the human uterus in extra-38 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. uterine pregnancy, was in many instances en- larged and developed and plentifully supplied with blood, indeed it often appeared as well adapted as its fellow for receiving and cherishing the rudiments ; but with all its aptitudes for ge- neration, it lay under one capital defect—its canal was interrupted ; it intercepted the access of the semen to the rudiments, and without this access generation could not be accomplished. To confirm this conclusion, the accuracy of which I doubted at the time, it was determined to submit it to the test of another train of expe- riments. In these it was my object, to preserve the principle of the preceding operation, the ex- clusion of the semen from the rudiments ; and yet at the same time, to vary its circumstances as much as possible, in order to ascertain how far they had affected the result; for I need not ob- serve, that circumstances often exert a silent and most fallacious influence over our experiments, (our negative experiments especially) to be de- precated the more, because, from its insidious nature, it is so frequently overlooked. In this second series of experiments, therefore, instead of operating upon rabbits that were full grown, I made use of those only that were under their puberty; and instead of interrupting, as be-PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 39 fore, the canal of the uterus, I interrupted that of the vagina. The vagina of the doe, it has been already ob- served, is at least three inches in length; so that although it is interrupted at the uterine extre- mity, there still remains sufficient room for the male organ. Of this peculiarity I availed myself, in conducting these experiments; and instead of cutting the uterus, I cut the vagina asunder, (near to the mouth of the womb) so as completely to interrupt its canal. In other respects the ex- periment was conducted as before. This operation proved dangerous, much more so than the former; a number of the rabbits, however recovered, and admitted, without repug- nance, the approaches of the male. The result was decisive. Although the external genitals of these animals were turgid with blood, aud the sexual excitement of some was remarkably lively ; although too, in some of them, intercourse was renewed at intervals of a week or a fortnight, on the whole, as many as twenty or thirty times, not one became pregnant. Desire itself in one or two instances, seemed almost insatiable; and in the rest, though suspended by coition for a time, in the course of a few hours, or a few days at farthest, it invariably recurred.40 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. The same general appearances were observed on dissection, in them all. The vagina, if the operation had been properly performed, was com- pletely interrupted. In both the ovaries there were corpora lutea. In some cases, the wombs ap- peared to have undergone little change; in others, they were very much enlarged, and evolved as completely as in actual pregnancy; but in no one instance was there the appearance of a single ovum, extra-uterine or in the womb. In these, as in the preceding experiments, though in a different manner, the access of the semen to the rudiments had been intercepted, and under these circumstances, notwithstanding repeated com- merce with the male, the formation of the young animal could not be accomplished. In performing the experiments recorded in the preceding paragraphs, there are various little niceties in the mode of operating, the observance of which is necessary to ensure success. The incision which is carried through the abdominal coverings, may be made in the linea alba, and should be eight or ten lines, at least, in length, in order that the parts may be replaced with facility. It should, too, lie as close to the sym- vhysis pubis as possible, that the intestines, which in this herbivorous animal are numerous and cumbersome, may not, as they are apt to doI PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 41 when the incision is higher, protrude at the opening. It is true, indeed, that if the incision is placed in the vicinity of the pubes, the bladder, when it is distended, will fall in the way ; but if the operator possess the requisite dexterity, there is no danger of wounding it; and a gentle pres- sure, persevered in for a time, will occasion it to, withdraw into the pelvis. It deserves remark, however, that to produce this contraction, a little perseverance is necessary ; for the bladder is not, in this manner, so readily excited to contract, as from previous reasonings on its irritability, we might have been led to expect. To close the abdominal opening, the Glover’s suture will serve as well as any other; nor does the including the peritoneum in the stitches, so far as I have been able to observe, materially in- crease the risk of a general inflammation. Ex- emption from this, depends much more upon the habit of the animal, than the niceties of the wound. And here I may be permitted to remark, in the way ol digression, that from various observations* Opeiations for hernia and on the abdominal viscera of rab- bits and dogs. The rabbit I suspect is very liable to spontaneous inflammation of the bowels. I have known in women the ma-| lignant ulcer of the womb penetrate into the peritoneal cavity,'*42 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. upon brutes, as well as my fellow-creatures, I cannot forbear imagining, that the risk of exten- sive inflammation, from local injury of the 'perito- neum, has been exaggerated, perhaps greatly. The high importance of this principle* * in surgery, is too obvious to require a comment; already a sufficient number of observations has been accu- mulated, to induce us to examine it with atten- tion; and I may add, that it is one of those grand practical points, which ought not to be decided by a few casual facts, much less by authorities, however venerable; but, like every other princi- ple of a solid philosophy, by various, deliberate, and unbiassed experiment and observation. If in performing this operation (as in the first set of experiments,) the womb is divided, the in- cision should be made transversely near its mouth, in order that we may leave the fallopian piece as large as possible, for the reception of the ova, in case the genitals should have power to form them. It ought, too, to be carried from four to six lines into the mesometry, in order that the pieces thus between the rectum and the uterus, without exciting a general in- flammation of the belly. * This paper was read before the Medico-Chirurgical Society in the May of 1819. Finding that the principle here referred to did not excite so much attention as I conceive it ought to do, I Iwas afterwards led, in the paper on abdominal surgery, again to bring it undcf'the notice of the profession.PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 43 liberated, and moving out of opposition with each other, may not reunite so as to form anew a con- tinuous canal. If, on the contrary, (as in the se- cond scheme of experiments,) the vagina be di- vided, a ligature should,be applied to the orifice of that piece of it which remains annexed to the womb, and the ligature should be fastened to the margin of the external wound. This precaution ensures the escape of the thread*, and at the same time prevents the pieces of the vagina from falling into opposition, and renewing the conti- nuity of the canal. When the genitals are mature, the rabbit very frequently dies from this operation, which, in consequence of the large size of the vagina, is more violent than the former. It is better, there- fore, on this account, as well as for reasons already assigned, to operate before puberty. Previously to this change the parts are compara- tively small, and the interruption of the vagina In operating upon the viscera of small animals, I have occa- sionally used a very slender ligature, have cut it short, and left it. In two rabbits, which had apparently recovered after the vagina had been tied in this manner, a general inflammation of the belly came on about six months afterwards, in the winter, when the health of the animals was impaired by the severity of the season. On inspection aftei death, it was found, that the ligature still adhered to the vagina, and it seemed to form the centre from which the inflammation had spread.PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 44 does not, as we might have been led from pre- vious reasonings to expect, prevent the subse- quent developement of the sexual organs. But to return from these details. Although it appears probable, from the pre- ceding experiments, that the complete process of generation requires the access of the semen to the rudiments, it seems equally certain, from a variety of appearances which I noticed in the course of my experiments, that to -a certain ex- tent, though imperfectly, it may be accomplished without it. These appearances I shall now pro^ ceed to state. In both the uterine and vaginal experiment, the womb, though it contained no fetuses, in many cases enlarged, as in extra-uterine pregnancy. Its structure, too, became thoroughly developed ; it received more copious supplies of blood ; in short, it frequently seemed as well prepared as its fellow, for receiving and cherishing the rudi- ments*. The ovaries, too, I may further add, although * It deserves notice, that, in the uterine experiments, it was generally the fallopian portion of the womb to which the semen was not applied, and not the vaginal to which it was applied, which appeared to undergo these changes in the highest degree.PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 45 there was no genuine impregnation of them, were very obviously excited. The vesicle in different parts of them germinated; its fluids increased; the delicate covering opened; the little cavity discharged its contents, and corpora lutea formed in all their perfection. As this appearance of the corpus luteum, notwithstanding the interception of the semen, is of considerable importance, and may help to clear away an objection to which the experiments lie open, it becomes necessary to examine it with attention. The corpus luteum in the rabbit, as long as it remains, is, I think, always marked by pretty strong characteristics, though its appearance dif- fers considerably with its age. A mammillary projection of the ovary, an augmented vascularity, a minute cavity, which, when the luteum is cut through, recalls to mind the appearance of a printed asterisk (*), constitute the leading charac- teristics ; and by these, I may add, it is so de- cisively marked, that, although the parts are on a small scale, an experienced eye may. detect it at a glance. Colour is of little use in distinguish- ing these bodies in the rabbit. The younger the luteum is, the more prominently the characteristics appear 1 In giving the name of corpus luteum to the appearance here described, I merely adopt the nomenclature of preceding physio-46 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. Now, these lutea, thus characterized, were distinctly produced both in the uterine and va- ginal experiments. In the uterine experiments I had an opportunity of contrasting those of the fruitful and sterile ovary with each other, and yet, after the most deliberate examination, I could not discriminate the slightest difference logists ; and in stating my belief that this appearance is the result of impregnation, or, at most, of the sexual excitement when ex- alted to its highest pitch, I am only advancing an opinion, which is, I conceive, as far as respects the rabbit, confirmed by observa- tion. I have frequently examined the ovaries of the doe, in the virgin condition, and during heat; and in one or two cases, after the animal had been under the. influence of long-continued and lively desire. In the two last instances I have never found the appearances described, though I dare not, from a negative obser- vation of this kind, deny, that, under these circumstances, their formation is possible. In the first case, on the contrary, I have invariably discovered them, and older or younger in their ap- pearance, according as they were examined sooner or later after impregnation. There can, therefore, I apprehend, be little doubt, that these appearances occurring in the rabbk, are the re- sult of conception. This fact is sufficient for my reasoning. It may, indeed, seem irreconcileable with the opinion which a vete- ran physiologist has formed, respecting the nature of the human corpus luteum (see Philosophical Transactions); but so long as it appears to be confirmed by observations, conformably to sound philosophy, it cannot be denied. I am far, however, from wishing rashly to impugn the opinion of Sir Everard Home. Truths once proved must be admitted, and their apparent incon- sistency demonstrates our ignorance, not their incompatability.PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 47 between them- It deserves notice, also, that in some instances they were more numerous upon the prolific, and in others upon the barren side of the genitals. In these experiments, it may be further re- marked, the fallopian tubes, as well as the ovaries and wombs, seemed to be excited by coition. I observed repeatedly, in those experiments in which the vagina was interrupted, that the ab- domen of the doe enlarged in a few days after the sexual commerce ; and that enlargement, never noticed before, and gradually decreasing * in a few weeks afterwards, if the male was ex- cluded, might by repeated coitions be carried to a very great degree. There is now in my pos- session, a doe with an interrupted vagina, which has admitted the male from twenty to thirty times. In this animal, in consequence of these repeated connections, the abdomen has gradually acquired so large a size, that it considerably ex- ceeds the bulk of mature gestation, and reminds one of the tumour of an ascitic which requires the trocar. These enlargements, I have ascer- tained from repeated dissections, result from the accumulation of a humor in the wombs. This humor, various in its consistency and colour, is. * It did not, however, subside completely.48 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. however, generally fluid and pale, and turbid, and always, so far as my experiments have ex- tended, forms albuminous concretions at a tem- perature below boiling heat. Even in the uterine experiments, (for the preceding remarks refer to the vaginal only,) the same essential appearances were observed ; the wombs, in consequence of impregnation, became filled, on the sound side, with fetuses, and on the barren with the humor described. These facts are very significant. The forma- tion of the lutea, the developement of the wombs,' and, above all, the repeated accumulations of fluid there, in consequence of coition, all seem to indicate the descent of the rudimental mate- rial; and reflecting upon them, I cannot forbear imagining that the tubes were excited, that they really transferred the rudiments to the womb, and that these rudiments engendered the watery ac- cumulations there, in the abortive attempts of generation. This notion receives some little countenance from the generation of oviparous animals; for in many of the different species re- ferred by naturalists to this class, the rudiments may be discharged independently of preceding impregnation. The common fowl is an example of this ; the frog, the toad, and a numerous tribe of fishes. This opinion, however, is merely con-PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. \ 4d jectural, and I must acknowledge candidly that it is the less entitled to confidence, as it rests on a sort of accidental observation, made subordi- nately, perhaps with some degree of remissness, at a time when others of greater importance in the inquiry occupied a principal share of my at- tention. This remark I take the liberty of in- troducing*here, as I conceive it to be the duty ol every experimental inquirer himself to distinguish between his conjectures and demonstrations, and thus, by the exercise of a philosophical frank- ness, to prevent error from insinuating itself from its association with truth. On the whole, then, it seems probable, judging from the appearances related, that generation may be carried forward to a certain extent, al* though the access of the semen to the rudiments be intercepted. Under these circumstances, the young animal cannot be formed, it is true; but corpora lutea may be generated; the wombs may be developed; and the rudiments, if we may judge from the facts already stated, may even be transferred to the uterine cavity by the play of the fallopian tubes, — .... . .. . . . ... It should be remarked, however, in dismissing this part of our subject, that these imperfect at- tempts at generation do not always equally occur. E50 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. Corpora lutea, I believe, will be found to form invariably after sexual intercourse, if the genitals are excited at all; but in some anomalous in- stances, there is no consequent developement of the wombs, and in others, no accumulation of the uterine fluid. The first of these failures has oc- curred to me once in twelve experiments, and the last of them five times*. But these negative irregularities merely prove, that, under circum- stances, the genitals may be more extensively excited at one time than another. They by no means invalidate the principle which it has been my endeavour to establish on positive facts, that the ovaries, tubes, and uterus, are capable of an imperfect excitement, even when the semen and the rudiments are kept apart from each other. Against the experiments and reasonings ad- vanced in the preceding pages, various objections may be urged, to which it may now be proper to advert. \ And first, it may be objected that sterility is sometimes an accidental occurrence. We fre- quently observe it in human generation. In the * In one or two instances the orifice formed by dividing the uterus remained open in the fallopian piece. This accounts for some of the failures of uterine accumulation. .PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 51 experiments under consideration it would perhaps have occurred, although the interception of the semen, to which it is ascribed, had not taken place. To these objections, however, I would reply, that in the rabbit the accidental failure of impregna- tion is rare, and does not occur in one doe out of twenty, if the animal be in health ; that the ap- pearance of the genitals, and the behaviour of the female when the male was admitted, both of them indicated inclination and aptitude for gene- ration ; that these experiments were not solitary, but frequently repeated; and that sterility was not an accidental occurrence, in a single instance only, but an invariable result of them all. Nor must it be forgotten that the formation of the lutea, and the evolution of the uterus, are them- selves sufficient proofs that the genitals were not accidentally inactive; nor that in the uterine ex- periment, in which the semen was intercepted on one side only, there were undeniable proofs of the generative excitement in the formation of the young animals on the other. But there is another objection to which the ex- periments lie open, which, on a cursory considera- tion, at least, may appear to bear with consider- able weight. In these operations either the wombs or the vagina were cut asunder. It may be asserted therefore that sterility ensued, not so e 252 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. much in consequence of the interception of the semen, as from the debility induced in the geni- tals by operative violence; the germs afterwards perishing because the soil was become unfriendly. To this plausible objection, however, it might be sufficient to reply, that‘from the form of the parts the injury of the operation is merely local; that when the vagina is cut through, before pu- berty, the genitals suffer so little from it that they are afterwards brought to maturity in the same manner as if no operation had been per- formed ; and that in both sets of experiments, whether uterine or vaginal, the wombs frequently become enlarged and developed, and like a fruit- ful and well-dressed soil (to resume the figure al- ready adopted), are brought into high condition for raising the rudiments to perfection. To ob- viate this objection, however, in a still more satisfactory manner, the following experiments were instituted. I divided the vagina of two young does, just before their puberty ; but instead of securing the uterine piece to the verge of the abdominal wound, I allowed it to remain in apposition with the other. In consequence of this method of opera- ting the parts reunited; the canal of the vagina was renewed; and the sexual desires appearingPHYSIOLOGY OP GENERATION. 53 a few weeks after recovery, both the rabbits be- came impregnated. The inference is obvious. v The second set of experiments, turning on the same principle, was executed on the wombs them- selves. In these both the wombs were divided, the one in two, and the other in three places, in such a manner, however, that the incision was not carried completely across into the mesome- try; so that the pieces were retained in mutual apposition, and reunited without interruption to the uterine canal. The result of these experiments was decisive. From the very method of operating it is obvious the wombs were more roughly handled in this than in any of the preceding experiments ; ac- cordingly a larger number of the rabbits died ; and yet, notwithstanding this violence, the very first doe which recovered, produced no less than nine fetuses from her first intercourse with the male. Indeed so complete was the action of the uterus, that there was not one of the little masses of rudimental matter which it failed to mature ; and it was found, on a careful comparison of the wombs with the ovaries, that the number of fe- tuses and corpora lutea was the same. To these remarks I may add, that the human womb, al- though it have been cut or torn, or partially54 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. destroyed by ulceration, still retains the power of maturing the rudiments. Healthy children have been born, not only after recoveries from uterine rupture and the Cesarian operation, but even at the time when the neck of the womb had been ulcerated. A case of this kind has lately fallen under my own knowledge ; and others are re- corded by obstetric writers. There yet remains a third objection, which, it is conceived, may be completely obviated, though at first view it wears a very formidable aspect. The vagina of the rabbit is very long and very large; its course is not direct; the organ of the male can neither fill it nor penetrate to the orifices of the wombs; how then can the semen be injected into the uterine cavity, even granting that it might meet the rudiments there ? This objection, felt in all its force by those who have examined the genitals merely in the preparation glass, falls at once when they are viewed in the rabbit while it is living; or, to avoid unnecessary severity, immediately after the dealer has killed it. Both the vagina and the wombs perform a sort of peristaltic action, the wombs somewhat ob- scurely, the vagina in a manner scarcely less livelyPHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 55 than the intestines of the animal themselves. This canal indeed, during the heat, is never at rest; it shortens, it lengthens, it changes con- tinually in its circular dimensions; and, when irritated especially, will sometimes contract to one-third of its quiescent diameter. Now this peristaltic action, resembling the intestinal, is itself sufficient to explain the transmission of the semen*. In addition to this action, however, the vagina performs another, easily comprehended on inspection, although, as frequently happens, the verbal description of it may perhaps appear a little obscure. The action to which I here allude consists in the falling down, as it were, of that part of the vagina which lies in the vicinity of the wombs ; so that it every now and then lays itself as flatly over their orifices as we should apply the hand over the mouth, in our endeavours to stop it. So close is this application, that I have some- times fancied I could perceive externally some- thing resembling a little dimple, occasioned by the sinking of the surface of the vagina into the orifice of the womb. How well adapted the whole of this curious movement is for the intro- * There is some little reason for surmising that even the hu- man vagina can perform a sort of peristaltic movement. Two facts have been related to me which lead to this opinion, but they ate of a character too delicate for public exposure.56 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. duction of the semen at the opening, it is need- less to explain. The mere performance of it fur- nishes no contemptible argument in proof of that approach of the semen to the rudiments for which I have been contending. Before I close these observations (already per- haps too diffuse) I cannot forbear adverting to some other points of the genital physiology, which they may contribute to illustrate. It has been asserted by some naturalists, that the corpus luteum is an evidence of genuine im- pregnation. It seems certain, however, from the facts related, that this evidence cannot be relied on ; for the luteum, in these experiments, was generated under circumstances in which, as the event proved, impregnation was impossible. In- deed there seems to be little reason for doubting, that the corpus luteum may be produced, even independently of the sexual intercourse, by the mere excitement of desire in a very high degree. Mr. Saumarez has recounted experiments, in his “ New System of Physiology,” in which the lu- teum appears to have been generated in this very manner. I have now in my possession a prepara- tion, (for which I stand indebted to Dr. Cholmeley and Mr. Callaway,) consisting of the ovaries of a young girl, that died of chorea, under seventeenPHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 57 years of age, with the hymen, which nearly closed the entrance of the vagina, unbroken. In these ovaries, the corpora lutea are no fewer than four. Two of them, it must be acknow- ledged, are a little obscure ; though an experi- enced eye, I conceive, would readily detect them. The remaining two are very distinct, and differ from the corpus luteum of genuine impreg- nation, merely from their more diminutive size, and the less extensive vascularity of the contigu- ous parts of the ovary. In every other respect, in colour and form, and the cavity which they contain, their appearance is perfectly natural, indeed so much so, that I occasionally circulate them in the class-room, as accurate specimens of the luteum upon the small scale. On this point I have been the more explicit, both as the principle is of some importance in forensic medicine, and as it removes at once an objection to which these experiments lie exposed, and which is taken from those of Dr. Haighton. In these experiments, very ingenious, and ex- tremely beautiful, my valued relative has shewn, with his usual accuracy, that the corpus luteum may form though the fallopian tube have been obliterated in some part of its course, and the access of the semen to the rudiments therefore have been intercepted. When,.however, he infers58 . PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. " t from this, in opposition to the principle asserted in this memoir, that the ovary has been impreg- nated, notwithstanding the interception of the semen, he certainly falls into one of those errors, from which the most wary physiologist is never absolutely exempt ; for the corpus luteum in the rabbit is not a certain evidence of impreg- nation. The appearances related, I may further remark, afford, when combined with others, a plausible proof that the semen sometimes penetrates as far as the ovaries; a point which has been much controverted. In the varieties of human generation, we some- times meet with extra-uterine pregnancies, in which the ovum not only lodges in the tubes, or the peritoneal cavity, but in the ovary itself. Indeed, this form of the disease seems on the whole to be the most common. Now, if it be true, as I have endeavoured to prove, that the young animal cannot be formed unless the semen have access to the rudiments, it is evident, that in these pregnancies, in which the fetus is generated among the graafian vesicles, the sellien must have made its way up to the ovaries themselves. It must not, however, be too hastily inferred from this, that the semen always penetrates into thesePHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. 59 remote recesses of the genitals. Facts have been related, which give a shade of probability to the conjecture, that without the contact of the semen the rudiments may sometimes descend into the uterus; and certainly, although the opinion is not without its difficulties, it is not impossible that they may meet each other there*. There is yet a third point in the physiology of generation, which the preceding experiments may contribute to elucidate. It has been contended by some naturalists, and not without show of rea- son, that the semen in generation is transferred to the blood-vessels ; and as the purgative or emetic, when ejected into the veins, exert their peculiar influences on the stomach or the bowels, so also, in their opinion, this active fluid, transmitted by the absorbents, makes its first impression on the vascular surface, and its second, by a similar sym- pathy, on the genitals themselves. What effects might be produced by injecting the semen directly into the veins when the genitals are in a state of excitement, I shall not venture to determine; as yet I am in possession of no decisive experiments upon the point, and it would be a mere waste of mind to speculate without them. It seems evi- * Is the transfer of the semen beyond the womb the cause of «xtra-utcrine pregnancy ?K» ... 60 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. dent, however, from the facts related, that after transmission through the absorbents and their glands, tlie semen retains no such generative in- fluence. It will be readily conceded, that when a rabbit admits a large male, in vigorous health, and in the flower of its age, as many as twenty or thirty times, a large quantity of the genital fluid must be imbibed by the absorbents of the vagina, yet neither in the uterine nor the vaginal experi- ment, in which these repeated coitions sometimes took place, was impregnation by absorption ac- complished. The simple exclusion of the semen from the rudiments always prevented the forma- tion of the young animal; in the vaginal experi- ments it was not produced at all ; in the uterine it was formed on that side only where the womb remained pervious. On a review of the whole inquiry, it will, I conceive, appear not improbable that, for the completion of generation, the semen must have access to the rudiments; and yet that notwith- standing the necessity of these approaches for its completion, the process to a certain extent may be accomplished without them. These are the two leading propositions which it has been my endeavour to establish; at the same time I have subordinate^ attempted further to shew, that the corpus luteum is not a proof ot ge- nuine impregnation; that the semen, at least<t PHYSIOLOGY OF GEN.ERATION. 61 occasionally, penetrates as far as the ovaries; and that however copiously this fluid may be absorbed into the vessels, it is incapable of giving rise, by any impression there, to the complete circle of the generative actions. Whether these principles of brute generation may be transferred to our own, I will not venture to determine. Analogical arguments, generally the best that physiology furnishes, are, it must be admitted, never absolutely demonstrative; but as the generation of the rabbit, in its other prin- ciples, resembles that of the human female, there seems to me but little reason for supposing that there is an essential difference here. Now granting this, and there seems to be no- thing unreasonable in the assumption, ,we may, I think, from the whole inquiry, draw a few prac- tical inferences; and these I am the rather induced to state, because some well-meaning persons of weak minds, incapable of perceiving the con- nexion between speculation and practice, are led to condemn investigations of this sort as idle, and therefore, as unjustifiable and cruel, because, until they are instructed, they do not know how to use them. And, First, it may be inferred, that when the womb is extirpated by ligature there is no danger, lest62 PHYSIOLOGY OF GENERATION. from commerce afterwards with our sex, an extra- uterine pregnancy should be produced. And, Secondly, it follows, that when the Cesarian operation is performed, the possibility of a second need of that operation may be precluded by re- moving, on either side, a small portion of the fallopian tube, so as to intercept its calibre.* In the third place, it is obvious that when the pelvis is so small, that delivery cannot be accom- plished after seven months are completed, without breaking open the head of the child, the need of this murderous operation may be prevented by the same simple expedient. The sexual de- sires would, I believe, remain, but sterility would be produced; and though certainly not wholly unattended with danger, the operation is perhaps safer and less painful than the extraction by em- bryotomy, which has hitherto been used as a sub- stitute ; it demands, too, no sacrifice of a helpless fetus, and would require performance but once. Should these suggestions be verified, and brought into operation in the practice of future ages, I think it must be admitted that they amply justify the experiments which give birth to them, and render them a benefit to mankind. See page 25.SOME REMARKS OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. In common with many of my most intelligent friends, I have long entertained an opinion, that notwithstanding the improvements which have been already made in surgery, there are still many operations of importance which may be added to the science. Among these operations, transfusion may, I think, fairly rank as one; and it is with a view of keeping this valuable opera- tion before the profession, and in the hope of adding somewhat to the body of facts by which it may be still further illustrated, that I am in- duced again to make it the subject of a memoir. Without pretending to give an enumera- tion of all the cases in which transfusion may be tried, with a fair prospect of advantage, I may observe, that there are some cases, in which the practical utility of it is both great and obvious.64 REM AUKS ON THE 1. I remember being called once to a poor woman in my neighbourhood, who had lost a large quantity of blood after her placenta had been taken away. When I saw her, the he- morrhagy was stopped, but she was evidently sinking; and, notwithstanding the assiduous use of all the ordinary remedies, she died in the course of two hours after the first eruption of the blood. i 2. By a friend of mine, on the other side of the water, I was requested, some two or three years ago, to give advice in a case very si- milar to this. The blood came away from the womb, during, and after the birth of the placenta; and the patient died in the course of three or four hours afterwards, throughout greater part of which time she was obviously sinking, notwithstanding the ordinary remedies were actively tried. 3. A poor fellow, in one of our hospitals, lost a great quantity of blood in consequence of an injury of the leg; but, although it was pretty evident that death must ensue, he continued to breath afterwards for two or three hours. Now, in cases of this kind, (and I might enu- merate others which have fallen under my per-OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. G5 sonal notice,) when the patient is gradually sink- ing, and the bleeding is suspended, there is a fit opportunity for trying the operation of trans- fusion ; and, unless we are prepared, in the face of opposing facts, to deny the utility of the operation altogether, it must, I think, be ad- mitted that it would be used, in such emer- gencies, with the fairest prospect of preserving the patient's life. It is not, however, in conjuncturorbf this kind only that the operation deserves consideration : there are, too, other cases in which, transfusion should not be lost sight of, although its utility in them is certainly much more dubious. We know that in hanging or submersion, death, at first, is apparent only, and not real; for a certain period after respiration stops, resus- citation is still possible. Now, that death from bleeding may also for a time be apparent, is by no means unlikely; and it is not impossible, therefore, that transfusion may be of service, if performed within a given period even after the breathing has been stopped. Under this impres- sion it was that I instituted the following ex- periments ; and although the results have not cor- responded with my wishes; and although too they do not by any means form a complete body FSOME REMARKS ON THE 66 of information on the point, with the view of making an opening in the subject, I am induced to record them. 4. Into the right carotid of a dog, which weighed about ten pounds avoirdupois, I intro- duced a tubule, directing its extremity towards the heart, and drew off about half a pint of blood, which was all that could be abstracted. At first the blood flowed with impetuosity for somewhat less than a minute, after which there was very little farther discharge; and ap- parent death was produced, respiration ceasing, and the abdominal muscles becoming relaxed, within about four minutes from the time when the artery was opened, and within about three minutes from the time when the blood ceased to flow in an impetuous stream. About one hour (64') after the attack of apparent death, a large quantity of blood was transfused into the jugular vein towards the heart from the carotid of another dog; but no signs of returning life appeared. 5. I opened the carotid artery of a dog, the same in size as the former, and introduced a pipe, as usual, the blood flowing away for about half a minute in an impetuous stream, and sluggishly for two minutes longer, so that about halt a pint altogether was withdrawn; the breathing ceasingOPERATION OE TRANSFUSION. 67 entirely, and the abdominal muscles becoming1 relaxed, about four minutes from the time when the discharge began. About half an hour (34') afterwards, I trans- fused into the jugular vein, as before, blood taken from the carotid artery of another dog, without however producing any signs of returning life; and about an hour after the bleeding, and half an hour after transfusion had been performed, the hot bath was tried, but without obvious advantage. \ 6. I drained another dog from the carotid artery, in the same manner as the two preced- ing ; about half a pint of blood being drawn away as before. Apparent death, marked in the ordi- nary way, by a total cessation of the pulse and respiration, came on four minutes after the blood began to flow. About ten minutes after the attack of as- phyxia, I replenished the animal, by the jugular vein, with blood taken from the carotid artery of another dog, but no signs of returning anima- tion were produced. 7. Into the left carotid artery I introduced a pipe, as in the former experiments, with its extremity towards the heart; the dog weighed f 268 SOME REMARKS ON THE thirteen pounds three ounces avoirdupois ; and about eight ounces of blood were got away. Apparent death came on about two minutes from the time when the blood began to flow, though a few convulsive respirations occurred, for some two or three minutes afterwards. \ About twenty minutes after the apparent death commenced, I injected into the jugular vein, towards the heart, as before, several ounces of blood taken from the carotid artery of another dog; and very soon afterwards, I tried the arti- ficial respiration actively, together with the hot bath for an hour, without, however, producing the slightest indication of returning life. On ex- amining the heart subsequently, I found the left side of it empty, and the right charged with blood ; and it should be remarked particularly, that this blood was clotted. 8. I introduced a tubule into the left carotid of a dog of middling size, directing its extremity towards the heart, and got away about half a pint of blood ; the blood first issuing in an impetuous, and afterwards in a sluggish stream. Nine minutes after the blood began to flow, (not earlier,) the circulation ceased to be distinguish- able in the femoral artery; and it was not tillOPERATION OE TRANSFUSION. 69 fourteen minutes after the opening" of the carotid that apparent death occured; so that in this, as in the subsequent experiment, (9) thirteen or fourteen minutes, instead of three or four, elapsed before apparent death was produced. Thirty-five minutes after the attack of apparent death, and about fifty minutes after the artery was opened, I transfused blood by means of a tubular apparatus, not above four inches long, into the carotid artery, instead of the jugular vein of the animal, directing it towards the heart; and though the quantity which entered i# could not be exactly ascertained, as the blood was not seen, there is reason to believe it was considerable, for the emittent dog was very languid afterwards. About fifty minutes from the commencement of apparent death, I attempted resuscitation by the hot bath ; and a thorough inflation of the lungs, in which natural respiration was imitated, as exactly as possible, for half an hour together, but without producing the slightest sign of re- turning life. This experiment succeeded exceed- ingly well in all its parts. 9. In a dog, which had not acquired its full size, and of a habit somewhat delicate, I opened the carotid artery of the right side, introducing, SOME REMARKS ON THE the tubule towards the heart. For about half a minute the blood flowed in an impetuous stream; and then, for several minutes longer, it escaped very slowly from the tubule, which was kept clear from coagula, by the occasional introduc- tion of a stilet. The whole quantity of blood drawn, however, scarcely exceeded half a pint. At first the respiration was tolerably natural; but when the animal was pretty well emptied, it became disordered ; deep sighings frequently oc- curred, and about twenty minutes from the time when the artery was opened, (not earlier,) respira- tion stopped altogether, the pulse disappearing completely in the femoral artery; the abdominal muscles becoming very flabby; and the animal lying, to all appearance, dead. About five minutes after respiration was stop- ped, and about twenty-five minutes from the time when the blood had ceased to flow with impetuosity from the tubule, I injected into the jugular vein, towards the heart, blood taken from the carotid artery of another dog; the ope- ration being continued for three or four minutes. The effects were immediate, shuddering first oc- curred, then respiration, then vascular action, and ultimately complete recovery. 1 am dis- posed to think, that the heart of some dogs isOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 71 much more retentive of its irritability than that of others; ancl that, in bull-dogs especially, the cardiac irritability is tenacious and permanent. This dog, though delicate, was very savage, and probably had a taste of the bull-dog blood; so that the heart was, perhaps, more tenacious of irritability than ordinary, which may account for its recovery. From these experiments, a variety of inferences may be drawn, which, although they do not lead us to expect much from transfusion, when the asphyxia of hemorrhagy has been produced, are sufficient, I think, to bear us out in the assertion, that in cases of this kind, in which • there is no other hope, the operation may deserve consideration: and we may infer, 1st. That the time which intervenes between the opening of an artery, and the attack of ap- parent death, varies exceedingly in different in- dividuals, even when the artery remains unclosed, and the bleeding therefore is not obstructed. In some of these dogs it was about two minutes, in some four, in one fourteen minutes, (8) and in one twenty (9). 21 y. That after the cessation of respiration, and the relaxation of the abdominal muscles in the \72 SOME REMARKS ON THE \ dog, the animal very speedily becomes irrecover- able by the process of transfusion ; for it will be observed, that when the dog was suffered to be in a state of apparent death for sixty-four, (4) thirty-four, (5) twenty, (7) nay, even ten minutes, (6), it could not be resuscitated ; and this too, although in Experiments 7, 8, the operation of transfusion was assisted by the stimulus of the hot bath, and an artificial respiration very dili- gently executed. Whether this principle may or not be transferred to the human body, admits a doubt; but the affirmative is probable. 31y. That one impediment to the resuscitation of the animal in these cases, arises, perhaps, from the coagulation of the blood in the heart, for concretions were found there on inspection in Experiment 7 ;' it should be added, however, that this was ascertained to be the case, by in- spection, in one of the dogs only, for the others were not examined; and that in other animals, as, for example, the ox, the blood has been found by an excellent experimental observer, Mr. Thackrah*, to be fluid in the heart, half an hour after the animal has been knocked down : nor must it be forgotten, that the blood of the dog has a much stronger tendency to speedy * See Thackrah’s Inquiry, p. 58, London, 1819; a valuable present to Physiology.OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 73 coagulation than the human blood. We must not therefore lightly make this inference general, nor transfer it without consideration to the human body. 41y. That although the dog cannot, perhaps, in general, be resuscitated, even a few minutes after the carotid artery has been fairly laid open, and distended by the introduction of a pipe ; and although resuscitation be improbable, if respi- ration has been suspended in consequence of bleeding, yet, now and then, recovery is possi- ble ; since, in Experiment 9, a complete resus- citation was accomplished, about twenty-five minutes after the artery had been opened, and four or five minutes after the animal had lain to appearance dead. And here it may be observed, transiently, how necessary it is not to draw conclusions hastily from a few experiments, but, on the contrary, to multiply them as much as may be, since it is by performing the same ex- periment repeatedly that important exceptions are sometimes ascertained. 51y. It follows from the preceding inferences, that if we are called to a patient fifteen or twenty minutes after the carotid artery has been laid open, the patient may be still respiring; and therefore, that resuscitation by means of trans- fusion, may not perhaps be found in every instance74 SOME REMARKS OIV THE impracticable. If the eighth pair of nerves were divided on one side only, the recovery might be permanent; and if it were cut through on both sides, the patient might be expected to live after- wards for a few hours. 61y. In some of these experiments, in which the carotid was laid wide open, the blood, to- wards the close of the operation, came away sluggishly, and in small quantities; so that the discharge might have been arrested by the mere pressure of the finger. When persons cut their throat, I strongly suspect, that by the pressure of the finger, or, by putting a fold or two of a handkerchief into the wound, the flow of the blood might sometimes be so far obstructed, as to prolong the patient’s life till further assis- tance could be obtained. If this assertion be true, it cannot be made too generally known. 71y. The preceding experiments do not enable me to decide, whether, in apparent death from bleeding, a preference should be given to the injection of blood into the jugular vein or the carotid artery; but, I think, on the whole, the blood ought to be injected into the carotid artery, toward the heart, in order, if possible; to renew the circulation through the coronary vessels, on which, I suspect, the irritability of the heart depends. But to proceed.OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 75 The formation of blood is the principal end of the chylopoietic viscera, and of their auxiliaries ; and it seems, therefore, not improbable, in those cases in which the action of these viscera is in- terrupted by schirrosity of the pylorus, or other causes, that their operations might be superseded by the injection of blood into the veins, so as to supply the vessels in a direct manner with that blood, which in health is the result of sanguifica- tion. As, however, opinions derived from rea- sonings of this kind are exceedingly uncertain, until they are brought to the test of experience, I have been induced to institute an experiment, not unattended with labour, with a view of de- monstrating that dogs certainly may be supported for a length of time by the transfusion of blood only, without the aid of food taken into the ali- mentary tube; and the following is a brief state- ment of the results. For three whole weeks I nourished a clog by the mere transfusion of blood into the ex- ternal jugular vein. The aggregate quantity in- lusecl during this period, was eighty-four ounces, avoirdupois, nearly ; that is, on an average, four ounces a-day; and during the whole time the animal was allowed to swallow nothing except water, and, indeed, never manifested any marked desiie for solid aliment. The blood, during theSOME REMARKS ON THE ?6 first eleven days, was injected by the syringe, but during the remainder of the term it was transmitted direct from the artery of the emittent dog, by means of a tube. The kind of blood used was the arterial. 21y. At the end of this period I found the dog, which weighed twenty-six pounds two ounces when the experiment began, had lost seven pounds two ounces of its weight; yet, although somewhat emaciated, and in its general health a good deal disordered, it appeared still to be in no danger whatever from inanition. That this dog had been effectually nourished by the blood with which it was supplied, there can, I think, be little doubt; for had this not been the case, the animal must have been exhausted or nearly so, after a fast of three weeks. And as dogs, a little above the middle size, when they are kept without food, lose from eight to sixteen ounces of their weight in the course of twenty- four hours, it is evident, even without nice adjust- ment of the calculation, that unless nourishment had been derived from the blood, the loss of weight in three weeks must have been more con- siderable than seven pounds two ounces. 31y. In the course of this experiment theOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 77 dog’s health was a good deal impaired; in part, perhaps, in consequence of the large wounds in the skin, which in my method of operation it was necessary to make, in order to get re- peatedly into the jugular veins ; and in part also, indeed principally, (I conceive,) in consequence of the manner in which the blood was injected. For as this was a first essay, and not so well conducted as it might have been had I possessed more experience in the operation, instead of in- jecting the blood daily or twice a-day in quan- tities of two or three ounces only, so as not to overload the vascular system, I generally trans- fused the blood at longer intervals of one, two, and once or twice of three days; and much larger quantities of blood, eight or ten ounces at least, were thrown in together. The consequence of this large supply was such a surcharge of the vascular system as would be produced in a full- grown man by the injection of not less than three or four pints of blood into the veins, with no other preparation than a fast of one or two days. Accordingly the animal seemed to be a little dis- tressed by it, though not so much as might have been expected from previous (a 'priori) reason- ing. The pulse became irregular, and inter- mitted frequently; there was languor, general tremor, and sometimes, but not invariably, aSOME REMARKS ON THE 78 disposition to sleep. On examination after death too, I found that the spleen and liver were de- cidedly larger than natural; the spleen weighed one ounce and three-fourths, avoirdupois, and the liver one pound three ounces and a half; and the right side of the heart was, in a greater pro- portion than ordinary, larger than the left. 41y. Why it is that the body of the dog wasted considerably, though four ounces of blood were, on an average, daily supplied to the veins, it is not easy to demonstrate; but I think it highly probable that this wasting was occasioned, not by any defect in the nourishing properties of the blood itself, but partly by the insufficiency of the quantity injected, and principally by the disorder of the system which the injection occasioned. That the latter part of this opinion is correct I incline to believe from an observation I made more than once, I mean that the dog wasted more rapidly during the first twenty-four hours after the injection, than during the twenty-four hours which followed them. From these facts and observations it may, I think, be inferred : 1st. That the dog may be nourished a length of time without the help of food, by transfusingOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 79 into the veins the blood of another individual of ' the same species, either by the tube or the syringe. 21y. That the blood which is supplied to the vessels in this manner does not support the body so effectually as an equal quantity would do, if derived from sanguification. 31y. That the health is liable to be much im- paired, by operations of this sort; and that en- largement of the heart, the spleen, and the liver, may be produced by them, in the course of three weeks. 41y. That these effects, it is probable, in the present state of our knowledge, are not inevit- able, nor of equal degree in all cases; but are rather to be attributed to the circumstances of the operation, than the nature of the operation itself. 51y. Whether these principles may be trans- ferred from the dog to our own species, is at present uncertain; but till we have proof to the contrary, they furnish a strong presumption, that the human body may be nourished by the injec- tion of blood.SOME REMARKS ON THE 80 In the progress of knowledge and the decay of prejudice, should the method of nourishing by transfusion be practised hereafter on the human subject, I suspect it will be found, that small quantities of blood are sufficient to support the body in a state of languid life; and that ill health is not inseparable from the operation, provided it be performed in a dexterous and judicious man- ner, and provided, especially, the blood be inject- ed frequently, in small quantities at once. But to conclude this part of my paper. There are perhaps various cases, in which blood may be transfused with advantage, but three more especially deserve consideration: — those, I mean, in which the patient is dying for want of nourishment; those in which the patient is already dead, to appearance, in consequence of copious bleeding ; and those cases, lastly, in which the breathing still continues, although it is pretty evident from the course of symptoms, that death must ensue in consequence of the loss of blood which has been sustained. These cases, under the present modes of management, are all of them desperate. /OPERATION OK TRANSFUSION. 81 Of the kinds of blood proper for the operation of trans- fusion, when performed on the human body. When the blood of one genus of animals is added, in small quantities, to that of another genus by transfusion, we have reason to be- lieve, (in the present state of our knowledge,) that no dangerous consequences will ensue; and I have heard Dr. Haighton assert, that after taking a few ounces of blood from the dog, he has afterwards transfused that of the sheep, in its place, without producing dangerous symp- toms. Now, if further experiments, multiplied and varied, should thoroughly confirm this principle, we may hope to find hereafter, that the blood of animals may be safely thrown into the human vessels, in small quantities daily, for the pur- poses of nourishment, instead of the human blood, which it must be more difficult to procure. Although, however, the blood of one genus of animals may, perhaps, without fatal conse- quences, be sparingly mixed with large quan- tities of the blood of another genus, all the facts, which have hitherto come to my knowledge, go to prove, that if an animal be drained of the blood in its larger vessels,, and replenished with large G \SOME REMARKS ON THE 82 i quantities of blood derived indifferently from another genus, great danger, and in general death itself will ensue.* 10. I took a dog of smaller size than ordinary, * but perfectly healthy, and drew off about four ounces of blood from the femoral arteries, when all the usual symptoms, dyspnsea, struggling, cessation of the circulation, relaxation of the ab- dominal muscles, and a complete asphyxia were produced, though, it should be observed, the quantity of blood abstracted was small. I then drew four ounces of blood by measure, from the human arm, suffered it to lie in the cup between fifty and sixty seconds, and injected it into the femoral vein. At first the dog seemed to be a little recovered from the operation, and both respiration and circulation were renewed ; but it died on the table in the course of a few minutes, not from the entrance of air, nor from excess in the quantity of blood injected, (for both these accidents were precluded,) but, ap- parently, in consequence of the substitution of human blood for the canine, or else, from the * Does there exist a genus of animals whose blood may be safely substituted for the human?OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 83 deterioration of the blood, occasioned by its lying in the cup of the syringe. The dog, be- fore the experiment, was perfectly healthy. i 11. From the femoral artery, of an old dog, of the terrier breed, valued a good deal for his hardi- hood and fondness for rat-catching, I drew off eleven ounces of blood, distress, dyspnoea, jacti- talior, and suspension of respiration being pro- duced by the operation, so that it was obvious, from the character of the symptoms, as well as from the quantity of blood which had been taken away, that unless transfusion were performed, the animal could not survive. I then drew two ounces of blood, from the arm of a healthy man, and suffered this blood to remain in the cup of the syringe for thirty seconds, before it was in- jected into the femoral vein of the animal. The operation was performed five times, about ten ounces of human blood being injected ; and every time, before the blood was poured into the ves- sels, it was suffered to lie at least thirty seconds in the cup. By the bleeding apparent death was produced, and the animal revived, as usual, in consequence of the injection ; the pulse, imper- ceptible before, returned distinctly enough into the femoral artery, beating, without obvious in- termission, one hundred and twenty times in the minute ; and when the dog was loosed from the g 284 SOME llEM-AliKS ON THE frame, it was able to walk about, and seemed to be pleased when noticed, and encouraged by the usual caresses. Notwithstanding this partial re- covery, however, the dog still remained languid, feeble, and evidently unwell; and though origi- nally of hardy constitution, it died in the course of the following night, about twelve hours after the operation was performed. The entrance of air into the veins was carefully guarded against in this experiment, and it appears, from the ex- periments which follow, that death was not oc- casioned by the mere exposure of the blood in the cup. 12. I took a large, lively, and very healthy bitch, and drew off, from the femoral artery, as much blood as could be abstracted, amounting to seven ounces. The ordinary symptoms, dis- tress, gasping, struggling, together with pro- found fainting were produced. As soon as the discharge was finished, blood taken from the human arm was infused, to the amount of six ounces nearly; this was received into the cup of the syringe as it flowed from the arm, and thrown directly, but tranquilly into the vein. In consequence of this injection the dog clearly recovered a little; it became sensible, and respired more regularly though not withoutOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 85 occasional gaspings; the abdominal muscles too became firm, and the blood circulated so freely, that it gushed out afresh from the femoral ar- tery. The recovery, however, was by no means so complete, as when canine blood is injected ; the action of the heart remained irregular, inter- mittent, and labouring; and the dog, after gasp- ing, and gaping convulsively, made ineffectual attempts to vomit, and died in the course of a few minutes. These symptoms are very similar to those which occurred in the following experiment, and to those which are produced in death from bleed- ing. That death was occasioned, in this instance, by the substitution of human blood for the canine, there can, I think, be little reason to doubt; and this is the more remarkable, because the blood was injected without being suffered, as in the previous experiment, to remain in the cup, and because the animal, immediately before the experiment was performed, was lively and well. It should be observed, too, that the quantity of blood drawn away, was not very large consider- ing the size of the animal, and that a temporary revival was produced; circumstances which make the death the more decisive. The experi- ment occupied but little time, and no untoward accidents occurred.S 6 SOME REMARKS ON THE amining the heart after death, I found the right fA/- ar / 13. From the femoral artery of a large, lively, and very healthy dog, I drew off as much blood as could be obtained by means of the tubule, in the usual manner, to the amount of eightoo** ounces, when the usual symptoms supervened; and I then threw in about five ounces and a half of human blood, in quantities of half an ounce at once. The blood was measured by means of the syringe, and it was not before injection suffered to lie out in the cup. In consequence of the hurried and careless manner in which the appa- ratus had been put together, a few bubbles of air got into the veins. By this injection the dog was revived a little, as in the former instances, but by no means so much so as it commonly is by the injection of blood taken from its own species. It noticed caresses, breathed more regularly, acquired firm- ness of the abdominal muscles, and had such a renewal of the circulation, that the blood issued afresh, though slowly, from the femoral artery. In the course of a few minutes, however, the same symptoms occurred as those which pre- ceded the death of the former dog : the auimal gasped, yawned convulsively, and vomited; and after lying about an hour, on its side, in a state approaching to faintness, it expired. On ex-OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 87 side was full of blood, and the left was com- paratively empty; the greater part of the blood was in a fluid state, and the few coagula found there were very small. It will be proved, by future experiments, that the few bubbles of air which entered the veins in conjunction with the blood were not capable of producing death. Had the blood of another dog been transfused, instead of the human, I have no doubt that the animal would have been perma- nently resuscitated, and the many experiments which I have made enable me to form an opinion on this point. 14. I took a young dog, of small size, very lively and healthy, before it was made the sub- ject of operation, and withdrew four ounces of blood from the femoral artery, it being all that could be abstracted ; the usual symptoms were produced, though the asphyxia was not so deep as in the preceding experiment. I then, without delay, threw in three ounces of blood by means of my syringe, not suffering it to lie out in the cup, excepting at the very com- mencement of the operation, when there was some pause, in consequence of one of the liga- tures not having been taken away. By this in-88 SOME REMARKS ON THE jection, the dog was resuscitated more complete- ly than in the three preceding experiments, and though very unwell, and feeble, it was able to walk about. Two hours after the injection, how- ever, there was thirst, languor, and debility; and the pulse was so small, and weak, that it could not be distinctly ascertained whether it inter- mitted or not. These symptoms gradually sub- sided, and on the third day the animal appeared to be rapidly recovering, but drooping, a second time, one or two days afterwards, it died on the sixth, with dropsy of the pericardium. An ounce of fluid was accumulated in this membrane; but there were no signs of inflammation, nor was there dropsy of the other cavities. 15. Having laid bare the left carotid artery, in a brisk, and very lively young dog, I drew away about eight ounces of blood, by means of a pipe introduced into the vessel, with its extremity to- wards the heart; faintness was produced, but not a total cessation of the breathing. I then, without delay, threw five or six ounces of human blood, into the external jugular vein, by means of the improved transfusing instru- ment hereafter described. By this injection the animal was a little resuscitated, the pulse became distinguishable enough in the femoralOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 89 artery, and the blood flowed so briskly along the vessels, that when the ligature was re- moved from the carotid, it gushed out in a full stream. Notwithstanding this partial re- suscitation, however, the dog when taken from the table was exceedingly languid, and lay at full length, on its side, in a state approaching to syncope, breathing slowly and cool; and in the course of half an hour or an hour afterwards, it died. This experiment is the more decisive, be- cause the death of the animal cannot be attri- buted to plethora, injection of air, or the pro- duction of too deep an asphyxia, by the abs- traction of the blood, as all these accidents were carefully precluded. It is one of the last experiments which I have made, and I do not hesitate to assert, after all the experience I have had of this operation, that if canine blood had been injected instead of the human, the dog would certainly have recovered. It deserves remark, that a drachm or two of blood, of an arterial tint, taken from the carotid of this dog after the injection, did not become solid at the end of seven minutes, although the blood of the dog naturally concretes in one or two. Now, as the human blood, like that of the horse, is re- markable for the slowness with which it coagu-90 SOME REMARKS ON THE lates, this fact goes to prove that the blood trans- fused, still retained the properties of human blood although it had been circulated for some minutes in the vessels of the animal. Whether the vessels of the dog, when the animal lives, as in experi- ment (14), possess the power of assimilating the human blood to its own is uncertain, but the affirmative is probable. These experiments acquire additional strength, when associated with others instituted by Dr. Leacock,* of Barbadoes, a few months before; experiments to which I am wholly indebted for my first notions on this point. From these it ap- pears, that if a dog be drained of its blood until apparent death be produced, it may, indeed, be revived, for a time, and very completely too, by replenishing it from the sheep, but it generally dies in a few days afterwards. Connected with my own, these experiments of Dr. Leacock possess a peculiar interest, for though they harmonize with them in the general result, they differ from them materially in their circumstances. It was arterial and not venous blood ; the blood of the sheep and not the human * Inaii#. Diss. Ed. 1S17.OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 91 that was substituted, and it deserves particular re- mark, that in Leacock’s experiments, the transfu- sion was not performed by the syringe, a method of operating with which he was unacquainted, but simply by the tube. From these facts it appears clearly that the human blood cannot safely be substituted in large quantities for that of the dog. It is certain that death was not produced accidentally, from the hurry of injection, or from plethora; from suffering the blood to accumulate in the cup of the syringe, or the dog, to remain too long in a state of asphyxia, for in some of the experi- ments, these accidents were carefully obviated, particularly in the last. 16. The only experiments that I know of, in which the human blood was substituted for that of the dog, by an operation similar to those de- scribed above, without destroying the animal, are those performed, six or seven years ago, by Mr. Goodridge, of Barbadoes, a gentleman who was at that time finishing his medical studies, at the united hospitals. In these experiments, pro- bably in consequence of the natural vigour of its constitution, and, perhaps, from the smaller quan- tity in which blood was injected, the animal was enabled to struggle through the consequences of92 SOME REMARKS ON THE the operation, but even in these cases, for some hours after the transfusion, a variety of unfavour- able symptoms occurred. As it is clear, from the preceding experiments, that the blood of one sort of animals cannot, with impunity, be substituted indifferently, and in large quantities, for that of another sort of ani- mals ; it follows, of course, that in performing the operation of transfusion on the human body, the human blood should alone be employed, at least, until we have discovered some other kind of blood as well suited to the vessels, as that which they naturally contain. Provided the blood transfused be derived from an animal of the same species with that which receives, it seems to matter but little whether that blood be arterial or venous. In most of those experiments in which, after draining the dog of its own blood, I resuscitated the ani- mal, and preserved its life, by supplying it with blood taken from the vessels of another dog, ar- terial blood was injected, in preference to the venous, because a full supply of this kind of blood might be more easily obtained. To satisfy myself, however, that venous blood possesses the resuscitating power, as well as the arterial,OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 93 17. I opened the femoral artery of a dog, not much larger in the body than a large cat, and drew off about four ounces of blood, (more could not be obtained,) when faintness, and relaxation of the abdominal muscles were produced. Re- spiration, however, was not suspended, nor was the asphyxia complete; but, from observation drawn from other experiments, I have no doubt, that, unless transfusion had been performed, the dog would have died. i After suffering the animal to lie in this state for some minutes, I injected, by means of the syringe, the blood of another dog, (about three ounces,) when the animal became so much re- vived by the operation, that it began to look about it, and was pleased when caressed, though unable, when loosened, to get down from the table. The venous blood issuing slowly from the emittent dog, I was compelled to transmit it in a very gradual manner, and some of it ac- tually coagulated in the cup, in which it was detained for several seconds. For many hours after the operation, the dog seemed languid and ailing, but on the third day it recovered very much, and ultimately got com- pletely well; the languor in this case, being, I think, fairly attributable to the exposure of the94 SOME REMARKS ON THE blood in the cup of the syringe, before it was transmitted to the animal. It may be noted here, by the way, that from this experiment we have proof, that blood may remain for several seconds in the cup, not indeed without becoming dete- riorated, but without being thereby rendered completely unfit for the purposes of life. 18. I took a lively, resolute dog, weighing 20lbs. avz. and drew off all the blood which could be got from the carotid artery, by a pipe of large bore, introduced, as usual, with its ex- tremity towards the heart. The quantity got away was thirteen ounces avoirdupois; and the dog lay to all appearance dead, respiration ceasing entirely, and the abdominal muscles becoming relaxed, insomuch that my assistants thought that the animal was gone beyond recovery, and I feared the same myself. Asphyxia having been induced in this manner, I drew blood from the jugular vein of another dog, and injected it direct, by means of the impellor, the dog becoming re- suscitated immediately, breathing, making a noise (as he had done before the blood was abstracted) expressive of anger and impatience, and strug- gling with some violence. The blood flowed afresh from the carotid artery of a bright arterial tint. When loosed from the table, the animal,OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 95 though languid, was able to walk about briskly; indeed, after the operation he appeared decidedly better than my dogs do in general, and after re- maining languid for a day or two, he recovered completely. The general health was impaired less in this, than in the preceding experiment; the reason of which I conceive to be, that the blood, flowing from the emittent dog more ra- pidly, was more promptly transmitted through the syringe, and was therefore less exposed, and less deteriorated by lying in the cup. I suppose there can be little doubt that, to save a patient, by transfusion, from the death of hemorrhagy, it would not, by any means, be necessary to pour in a quantity of blood, equal to that which had been lost. That quantity of blood only would be required, which would en- able the heart and arteries to act, and which would support the patient long enough to allow the vessels to accommodate themselves to the diminished volume of the blood, and to gain time for a new supply from the digestive organs. What, however, is the smallest quantity of blood which would be sufficient to support life, I have not hitherto laboured much to ascertain; and the rather, because it is exceedingly doubtful, whether conclusions of this kind can be trans-96 SOME REMARKS ON THE ferred, with any useful degree of certainty, from the dog to the human subject. 19. I once, however, laid bare the femoral vessels in a dog, and drew off, in the course of two minutes, about ten ounces of blood from the artery, by means of a pipe, which was introduced in the usual manner, with its extremity towards the heart. After the blood had been abstracted in this manner, the pulse disappeared in the op- posite limb, and the blood ceased to flow from the tube, excepting in slow drops, at long inter- vals : so that, after the experience which I have had in these experiments, I should not hesitate to assert, that, unless transfusion had been perform- ed, the animal must have died. After the dog had been suffered to lie in this state for a few seconds, I threw in, by means of the syringe, about two ounces of blood, in place of the ten, which had been taken away; when the animal was very decidedly resuscitated; re- spiration returned; the pulse became obvious; and the blood, upon slackening a ligature which had been applied, came out from the tube inserted into the femoral artery, in a pretty full stream. It appears, therefore, from this experiment, not only that blood transfused by a syringe, is capable of resuscitating an animal, but further, that a smallOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 97 quantity only (in this experiment one-fifth of the blood which had been lost) is adequate to the purpose.* From these experiments we may, I think, ven- ture to presume, until we have proof to the con- trary, 1st. That, in transfusion, venous blood may be successfully used, although, perhaps, arterial blood is preferable. 2ly. That an animal may be saved from the death of hemorrhagy, by the transfusion of a much smaller quantity of blood than that which it has lost. 3ly. That the blood of one genus of animals cannot be indifferently substituted, in large quan- tities, with impunity, for that of another genus; and, therefore, that if an operation be performed upon the human body, human blood only should * I think it is worth enquiry, whether, when there is a de- ficiency of the blood, the action of the heart and arteries may be kept up for a while, so as to gain time, by the mere injection of water into the vessels; in other words, whether blood, diluted with water, will support the actions of life, and to what degree it may be diluted. f H98 SOME REMARKS ON THE be employed, until some other blood be found which is equally congenial to the vessels. To these inferences may be added the following- remarks. It seems not improbable that animals of one genus possess the power of assimilating to their own the blood of another genus, pro- vided they live for days after it has bepn infused into their veins; as it is not easy to conceive, how life can continue for a length of time after- wards, (Experiment 16,) unless such assimilation be accomplished. Although the blood of one genus of animals cannot be injected largely into the vessels of another genus, without danger to life, it is not unlikely that small injections of this kind may be safely tried. The importance of this principle, in the operation of nourishment by transfusion, is obvious. Although an animal may be resuscitated by the transfusion of venous blood, I suspect that, of the two varieties, the arterial blood is the more efficacious; but into this enquiry I forbear to enter further at present. It is clear, from these facts and inferences, that although the blood of the mammalia may beOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 99 essentially the same in all the genera, the dif- ferent kinds of blood differ very importantly from each other. It is an interesting, and, per- haps, a difficult enquiry, Whether any genus of animals be furnished with a kind of blood con- genial to the human veins ? That of the horse is the most promising. Blood may be received into a cup, and passed through a syringe, without being thereby rendered unfit for the purposes of life. In performing transfusion there can, I con- ceive, be no doubt that blood ought to be trans- mitted by the tubule merely when this method is practicable ; but as we should probably meet with obstructions in operating in this way on the human body, I have been led to make experi- ments with a view of ascertaining whether blood may not be absorbed and propelled by means of a syringe, without becoming unfit for the purposes of life; for transfusion may easily be performed in this manner:— 20. Into the carotid artery of a very healthy dog, weighing about seventeen pounds avoirdupoise, I introduced a pipe, with its extremity towards the heart, and drew off eight or ten ounces of blood, (as much as could be got away), the ani- h 2SOME REMARKS ON THE 100 mal not ceasing to respire altogether, though struggling, stretching of the limbs, and the usual outcry which sometimes precedes dissolution were produced- The muscles became very relaxed. After the dog had lain in this languid state for a few minutes, I injected several ounces of blood in quantities of half an ounce at a time, suffering it to become a little inspissated in the cup of the syringe before it was infused. • By this injection the dog was revived a good deal, so that it was able to walk; but for some hours afterwards it remained dull and languid, and disposed to lie about. The day after the operation it seemed, as usual, to be a good deal better, but declined a little in the evening, and the day following it refused its food, and seemed so languid and unwell, that I really feared it would die. In the course of a few hours more, however, it recovered from this attack, and a few days afterwards became completely well. Whe- ther the ill health, greater than ordinary in this case, was occasioned by the entrance of air to- gether with the blood, by the inspissation of the blood, or by the transfusion of too small a quan- tity, I am unable to determine; but of the causes enumerated, I think the inspissation of the blood to be the most probable.OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 101 21. I drained a very fat brown dog, with hangs ing ears, and, to appearance, of tender constitu- tion, of all the blood which could be got from the left carotid artery, by a pipe directed towards the heart; the animal struggled hard, but con- tinued to respire occasionally. By means of the impelling syringe, I then threw into the external jugular vein blood taken from the carotid artery of another dog; but found on loosening the animal, that it was languid, and disposed to lie quiet more than ordinary. For four or five days after the operation, this dog continued in an ailing condition, was dull, and ate and drank but little; but after this period, it began to gather strength very fast, and soon became completely well. The languor and ill health, it deserves remark, were in this;, as in the former case, of longer duration, and more severe than I have generally found them ; perhaps in consequence of the ten- derness of the animal, and its very great cor- pulency : for on so fat a dog I never operated before. That the injecting apparatus was air- tight is certain. This experiment was made in the presence of Dr. Ritzius, of Stockholm. 22. I procured a dog of delicate habit, and not full grown, and drew off from the carotid artery102 SOME REMARKS ON THE all the blood which could be got out by means of the tubule, to the amount of four ounces and a half: somewhat less than the full measure usually obtained from dogs of the same bulk as this animal. Complaint, struggling, gasping, syncope, and relaxation of the abdominal mus- cles were produced, and in this condition, ap- proaching to complete asphyxia, the dog was suffered to lie for a few seconds. * I then, by means of a syringe, transfused ar- terial blood taken from another dog, to the amount of four measured ounces ; the blood, ow- ing to some impediments in the operation, lying some three or four seconds, at least, in the cup before it was transfused. In a few seconds the » dog recovered, and on opening the carotid ar- tery, the blood was found to break out afresh; not sluggishly, as in the experiment with human blood, but in an impetuous stream; and the dog, upon being untied, got up without difficulty, and leaped down, in a somewhat playful manner, from the table. Though languid for a few hours afterwards, in the course of a day or two it got completely well, and never at any time after the operation appeared to be in danger. This expe- riment was made with the very same syringe which I employed in those experiments already related (10, 11, 12, 13, and 14); in which theOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 103 human blood was transfused instead of the ca- nine ; and though the results of the two sets of experiments were so different, the operation was performed exactly in the same manner in both. 23. I drained a dog from the left carotid artery, in the same manner as in the preceding expe- riment, abstracting, as usual, all the blood which could be got away. The dog continued to re- spire a little occasionally, but was evidently dying, and the circulation was stopped. After waiting a few seconds, I threw into the jugular vein, by means of the syringe, blood taken from the carotid artery of another dog ; the recovery of the animal being sudden, and on the whole complete. It remained a little languid for three or four days afterwards, but ultimately got well, without the occurrence of a single alarming symptom. The syringe was air-tight. 24. I drained a young dog from the left carotid artery, in the usual manner, so that the cir- culation stopped completely, and the animal scarcely respired. Then, by means of the syringe, I injected into the left jugular vein blood taken from the ar- teries ol another dog, with the effect of com-SOME REMARKS ON THE 104 pletely resuscitating the animal, which a day or two after the experiment seemed to be unusually lively and well, and not a single bad symptom was observed afterwards. For the first three or four hours, the pulse intermitted a little, and I suspect that this symptom is not uncommon. Mr. Coleby, of St. Thomas’s Hospital, gave his assistance in this experiment. From the preceding, corroborated by expe- riments 17 and 18, it seems obvious enough, that although the blood of the dog become deteriora- ted, by passing through the syringe, it is not thereby rendered unfit for the purposes of re- suscitation and life. To confirm this principle, however, in my opinion of great practical im- portance, I have been induced to institute another scheme of experiments, of which the following is a brief and faithful detail. 25. I introduced pipes into the carotid artery and jugular vein of a dog, directing their extre- mities towards the heart, and then drew off, by measure, six drachms of blood into the bottom of a conical wine-glass ; absorbing it into a syringe, and afterwards injecting it into the jugular vein. This was done several times, till about six ounpes of blood had been transmitted in this manner;OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 105 after which I paused for a few minutes, and then performed the operation twice again in the same mode, about six ounces of blood being transfused each time; so that in all the three operations about eighteen ounces of blood were passed through the syringe, or, to assume the least es- timate, twelve or fourteen. , / During the operation the action of the heart was disturbed, and the dog, though able to walk about, was languid and ill immediately after it was finished. A day or two afterwards, how- ever, it became very lively and well, took its food largely, and did not appear to suffer a single bad symptom at any subsequent period. 26. Into the jugular vein and the carotid artery of another dog, I again introduced pipes, with the extremity towards the heart, and transmitted blood by means of a syringe and wine-glass from the artery to the vein, in the same manner as in the preceding experiment, at four different times, an interval of a few minutes being interposed be- tween each of the four injections. The second and third injections were sparing, of a few drachms only, but the first was much more abun- dant; and the last injection was long continued and very copious, insomuch that the blood wasSOME REMARKS ON THE 106 observed to issue at length from the artery of an unusually bright arterial tint, as if it were ren- dered doubly arterial; in no other experiments have I observed this phenomenon to be so con- spicuously marked. Owing to the imperfection of the apparatus, about a drachm of air got into the veins. In consequence of some alarm and agitation the pulse intermitted before transfusion began, but during the operation these intermissions became more frequent, occurring every five or six beats, the blood flowing sometimes impetu- ously and sometimes sluggishly from the carotid artery ; towards the close of the experiment these intermissions became less frequent, and in a few minutes afterwards ceased altogether. The entrance of the air did not occasion any unusual symptoms. The intermissions of the pulse, constituting the most remarkable symp- tom, must certainly be attributed in part to alarm, for it was observed before the operation commenced ; but it seems also to have arisen partly from the unequal and impetuous stream in which the blood was thrown into the heart. It is obvious that it cannot be ascribed to the arte- rial nature of the blood which was injected intoOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 107 the veins, or the changes it suffered in passing the syringe ; for although the arterial characters of the blood were heightened as the experiment proceeded, and some of the blood at least had passed the instrument more than once, these irregularities, instead of increasing, became less and less frequent. 27. By means of an instrument very similar to the “ Impellor” described in the close of this Memoir, I transferred blood direct from the femoral artery to the femoral vein of the dog, absorbing the blood from the cup of the instru- ment and discharging it promptly into the vein, without suffering any large accumulation and exposure in the cup. The operation was con- tinued for ten minutes together, but the blood was not observed to issue in the end of the ex- periment of an arterial tint brighter than ordi- nary. The dog was of the lap-dog breed, very tender, and similar in constitution to that which was used in (Ex. 21.) Under this operation the pulse sank down from 140 beats in the minute, its natural fre- quency, to 50 or 60 beats large and distinct; the dog in the same space respiring twelve times, a slight catch or spasm following each respira-108 SOME REMARKS ON THE tion. When taken from the frame the dog ap- peared to be languid and unwell, but it was perfectly sensible, wagged its tail when caressed, and walked, not without debility, several yards before it lay down, the pulse thirty or forty minutes after the operation, still not exceeding 60 beats in the minute. Notwithstanding these unfavourable symptoms, in the course of a few days the dog became completely well, the recovery being more speedy than I had expect- ed : whence it is evident, that although the blood had perhaps been impaired by transmis- sion through the syringe, it was not rendered wholly unfit for the purposes of life. Subse- quent experiments, however, render it exceed- ingly doubtful whether the bad symptoms pro- duced really arose from the mere exposure of the blood in the cup, and the transmission through the syringe, as in these it will be ob- served the same symptoms did not occur. This dog was of tender habit. 28. I took a dog of the sandy-coloured pug breed, apparently a hardy animal, and putting- pipes as usual into the femoral vessels, I transmit- ted blood, by means of the instrument used in the preceding experiment, from the artery to the vein direct, for eight minutes together, the blood flowing during the whole time, and towards theOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 109 • end of the experiment exhibiting the arterial characteristics in a higher degree than ordinary. After waiting about half an hour I performed the transfusion for eight minutes longer; and then pausing another half-hour, I operated a third time also for eight minutes, a few small con- cretions forming on this occasion in the cup: so that transfusion was carried on altogether for about twenty-four minutes, the blood flowing freely during the whole time. Assuming there- fore, what had indeed been ascertained by the preceding experiment, I mean, that in the course of two minutes about half a pint of blood came away from the femoral artery when kept open by the tube, twelve pounds of blood, at least, must have been transmitted through the instrument; and the same blood must of consequence have passed the syringe repeatedly, for the whole weight of the dog did not equal twelve pounds; and this conclusion is confirmed by the highly arterial character which the blood had acquired when the operation concluded. After remaining languid for a day or two, this dog recovered like the former. In the progress of this experiment, made with greater dexterity than the preceding, it is re- markable that very little derangement of the system occurred. The respiration was indeed a I110 SOME REMARKS ON THE \ little hurried, but the dog remained lively apd vigilant, and his pulse, irregular from fear before the operation was begun, became very ^regular as it proceeded, and beat, as usual in dogs of this size, about 150 times in the minute. Its temperature underwent but little change. The regularity of the pulse during this operation is very remarkable, especially if we consider its great irregularity in the preceding experiments. It must be recollected, however, that the trans- fusion was performed in this instance on the fe- moral vessels which are remote from the heart, and not on those of the neck. The formation of concretions deserves notice, as it proves that the blood in this animal remains tit for its pecu- liar functions, although certain parts are begun to concrete. / v . 29. I procured a dog weighing 151b. 2oz. avoir- dupoise, and inserting pipes into the carotid ar- tery and jugular vein, instead of the femoral vessels, I suffered the blood to flow, taking care to return it into the jugular by means of the impellor, as fast as it issued from the artery. A slight disposition to coagulation manifested itself; and some clots formed in the emittent tube, not however in sufficient quantity to close it. The syringe was air-tight, but one bubble,OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. Ill accidentally absorbed from the cup, was injected into the vein. For twenty-five minutes the operation was continued unceasingly, during all which time the animal did not appear to be in any way remark- ably disturbed, and immediately afterwards the pulse (naturally 140) beat 160 times in the minute, and the respirations were twenty-six. No intermissions of the pulse were observed, and, throughout the operation, the instrument playing well, the blood flowed in a moderate and equable stream. From a subsequent observation I ascertained that when the syringe was worked .with the same degree of rapidity as it had been during the ex- periment, a full half-pint, that is eight ounces avoirdupoise, were transmitted in the course of a minute; and it follows, therefore, that in the course of twenty-five minutes, during which the operation was continued, twelve pounds and a half of blood at least, probably more, must have passed through the instrument, though the whole weight of the dog scarcely exceeded fifteen pounds. The subject of this experiment was a large puppy of delicate habit, with hanging ears, and with a taste of the spaniel blood. The whole length of tubes and surfaces over which the blood112 SOME REMARKS ON THE passed in its way from the artery to the vein, was, as I ascertained by measurement, at least one foot and a half. Three hours after the operation the dog seemed disposed to lie about and was languid, but could walk very well, and there were 160 beats of the pulse, and thirty respirations in the minute. Next day the animal ailed but little; the day afterwards it was much better, and took plenty of food ; and the day following, that is the fourth, reckoning that of the experiment as the first, the general health appeared to be completely restor- ed. This experiment succeeded perfectly well in all its parts, and seems, in conjunction with the former, to prove clearly that blood may be transmitted through the syringe, and that, too, repeatedly, not indeed without injury, but with- out thereby becoming unfitted for the purposes of life. The experiment is the more satisfactory, because the dog was small and tender. • / - ' We must not, however, suppose that expe- riments of this kind are wholly unaccompanied with danger, or that success invariably attends them, even when performed upon the dog. 30. Introducing pipes in the usual manner into the carotid artery and external jugular vein ofOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 113 a dog, I transmitted the blood through the syringe for two or three minutes together, after which the flow from the artery became sparing, and I suspended the operation for two or three minutes longer, to give the animal an opportu- nity of recovering. When the operation was re- newed, the tubule slipped accidentally from the carotid artery, and two or three ounces of blood were lost before the artery could be secured ; at length, however, the pipes were replaced, and the operation proceeded, the blood flowing slowly from the arterial tubule, either in consequence of partial closure, or, as I strongly suspected, from the want of a full action of the ventricle; and the blood in the cup assumed a slightly gelatinous consistency. On this occasion the operation was continued for two or three minutes as before, at the end of which, the dog was seized with a few spasmodic contractions of the dorsal muscles, and died without a further struggle. The cause of death in this experiment is not obvious. The transmission of blood through the syringe, the partial coagulation of it, the distur- bance of the circulation by the injection of the blood along the jugular vein into the heart, the loss of two or three ounces of blood when the tubule was pulled out of the artery, the impres- sion of fear under which the dog laboured, maySOME REMARKS ON THE 114 all be supposed to have occasioned it. From viewing this experiment, however, in connexion with the preceding, (exp. 27.) I am inclined to think, that the partial coagulation of the blood, during its slow transmission, in the latter part of the operation, when the jflood flowed sluggishly from the carotid artery, was the most probable cause of death. The quantity lost was not sufficient to kill the animal, unless there were some peculiarity of constitution in this animal not usually found in dogs; and the result of former experiments shews, that it was not the ordinary deterioration of the blood by the syringe that destroyed it, and that it did not die from fear, or from a disturbance of the current of the blood, occasioned by the operation. In exp. 27, in which the blood during its transmis- sion through the syringe became, as in this experi- ment, a little inspissated, very dangerous symp- toms were produced, though the animal surviv- ing the first shock of the experiment, recovered rapidly afterwards. From the preceeding facts we may, I think, infer:— 1st. That blood, although it have been passed through the syringe, and repeatedly, is still capa- ble of supporting the life and health of the body. With one exception, all the dogs on which theseOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 115 operations were performed, eleven in number, re- covered, and some of them got completely well within two or three days afterwards. 2ly. That although blood which has passed the syringe retain its fitness for the animal pur- poses, it probably becomes deteriorated by this operation, especially if it lie for a few seconds out of the vessels, and be slightly inspissated in con- sequence. In exp. 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, the dogs suffered but little, but in exp. 20, 21, 26, 27, dangerous symptoms were produced. How long the blood may lie out of the vessels with- out becoming wholly unfit for the vital purposes, has not been ascertained, though the principle is well worth investigation. 31y. That the deteriorated blood, after it has, been thrown into the vessels, undergoes a sanative process, by which it again becomes thorough- ly congenial to the functions of the animal; for it will be observed, that most of the dogs, though languid for some two or three days subsequently to the operation, became very lively and well a few days afterwards. 41y. And probably, that dogs of tender con- stitution suffer more from operations of this kind than those which are more hardy ; other circum- i 2SOME REMARKS ON THE 116 stances being the same. This plain, but impor- tant principle, must be born in mind when we think of transferring these conclusions from the dog to the human subject. The preceding prin- ciples certainly hold true in the Pathology of the dog, but whether they hold true also in human Pathology must be ascertained by future observa- tion; the affirmative is in a high degree probable. Of Transfusion from the Arteries of one man to the Veins of another. In general, there must, I am aware, be con- siderable difficulty in obtaining arterial blood from the human body for the purposes of transfu- sion ; but persons may be induced occasionally, sometimes from motives of affection, and some- times for hire, to submit to the opening of an artery. • - \ If blood is to be transferred from the arteries of one man into the veins of another, it would be ne- cessary, in the first place, to lay bare a vein on the fore-arm of the patient to the extent of an inch or more, and then to bind a ligature between the hand and the intended opening, in order to prevent the escape of the blood when the circulation is re- newed ; after which an opening should be made with a lancet longitudinally, (in the course of theOPERATION OP TRANSFUSION. 117 vein I mean) so as to allow the ready entrance of the small venous tube, which should be slipped into the vessel towards the heart, and retain- ed there by pressure of the finger.* The patient who is to receive the blood being prepared in this manner, the operator should next prepare the person who is to supply it. Of the different arteries which may be fixed on as adapted to an operation of this sort, perhaps the radial, ulnar, or anterior tibial are the principal, and of these three I think the radial is decidedly to be pre- ferred, for its conveniency in other particulars as Avell as on account of its easy, access. The artery elected, a tourniquet should be put on the limb, between the intended opening and the heart, in readiness to be constricted, should emergency re- quire, and then, to the extent of an inch or two, the artery should be laid bare with the scalpel, extensively enough to secure the aperture against the obstructions arising from a deficiency of room. This done, the artery should be detached a little, say to the extent of half an inch, and a ligature * Should the small quantity of air lodging in this tubule be found to produce injurious effects, the tubule may be inserted first into the flexible tube, and then, after the whole tubular ap- paratus has been filled with blood, as hereafter explained, the tubule may be slid into the vein; but unless the operator be dextrous and prompt, the blood will become deteriorated, and even clotted, by lying in the inanimate apparatus.118 SOME REMARKS ON THE should be put on the vessel below, close against the part where it remains connected with the cellular web and the vasa vasorum; and about an inch from this ligature, a pair of spring forceps should be applied, which, closing of themselves, may press the sides of the artery together, so as to close it completely. The artery should then be laid open with a lancet to the extent of a line, (one-eighth of an inch) so as to allow the ready entrance of a small tube, and this opening should be made in the course of the vessel, as the artery, I find, when divided across, contracts more in its calibre, and, if the incision be a little too deep, is in danger of breaking completely through. A small tubule, about the size of a crow-quill, in connexion with a flexible tube, about as large as a goose-quill, should then be introduced into the artery with its extremity towards the heart, and should be secured there by means of a lig- ature'; the ridge, or shoulder, near its orifice, will give it a bearing line, and prevent its slip- ping out. The operation being brought to this point, the small arterial forceps are opened by pressing the handles together, so as to give pas- sage to the blood and expel the air from the tubes; after which, the forceps are suffered again to close, and the tubular apparatus being full of blood, the flexible tube is firmly connected with the tubule in the vein. With a moderate share of dexterity, the junction may be easilyOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 119 « accomplished in a few seconds, and before the hu- man blood, of slow coagulation, has time to become clotted; provided the venous tubule be made to unite with the flexible tube in the way of a plug. By pressing the tubule home into the flexible tube, and giving it at the same time a semi-rota- tory movement, the junction may be made sure. The apparatus being thus prepared, the blood should be admitted to it by opening the spring forceps, and by means of the same instrument: the rapidity of the flow, as well as the moment of its cessation, may be regulated with great nicety. After the operation has been concluded, the wounds and the injured vessels must of course be managed on the general principles of surgery; and it may not be amiss to remark, that if, with a view of facilitating the operation, the artery of the person who emits the blood have been detach- ed a little from its bed, when ligatures are after- wards applied, those ligatures ought to be applied close to that part where the vessel still remains in connexion with the cellular web, in order that the adhesion of the sides of the artery may not be interrupted, for want of connexion with the vasa vasorum. The instruments required for this operation should, I think, be shut up in the same case with the impellor hereafter described. Those which I would recommend, are the following:—a tourni-SOME REMARKS ON THE 120 quet, a scalpel, a lancet, an eyed probe, a blunted needle and ligatures, a pair of spring forceps, venous tubules, a smaller and a larger, and two flexible tubes, each about six inches long, one connected with a smaller and one with a larger arterial tubule to meet the varying calibre of the vessels, and both capable of uniting, in the way of plug, with either of the venous tubules. Of the Transfusion of Venous blood by means of the Impellor. When, in consequence of the want of arterial blood, it becomes necessary to transfuse the ve- nous, a different method of operating must be adopted; and, in the present state of our know- ledge, I would recommend in such cases, the em- ployment of the impellor. In operating with this instrument, a chair is to be procured, and by means of a gimlet an aperture is to be worked into the outside of the back of it, at a convenient elevation, and into this aperture the vice of the apparatus is to be very firmly screwed. By means of the solid stem which pro- jects from its apex, the cup is to be fixed erect in the gripe of the vice, and the large outer cup, containing the impelling part of the instrument, is to be filled with tepid (96°) water, if this can be pro- cu red, so that the whole of this part of the appa-OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 121 ratus, inclusive of the syringe, may be covered in completely by the water, in such manner that the entrance of air into the instrument by leakage, whether of the joints or of the syringe, may be effectually precluded. The apparatus being thus far prepared, the inner cup is to be put on, care being taken to fit the tube which projects below from the apex of this inner cup, to the corre- sponding tube which springs up from the cylinder with which the syringe is connected, and which lies in the bottom of the largercup ; because, if the exact apposition of one tube to the other be ne- glected, a difficulty may needlessly arise in putting the inner cup into its place, in consequence of the two tubes interfering in an obstructive manner with each other. Half a pint, or a pint of water is then to be poured into the inner cup and pump- ed briskly through the instrument, so that the air may be expelled thoroughly, the water taking its place; and the extremity of the flexible tube which springs from the instrument is towards the end of the operation to be bent down into water contained in a tumbler, the pumping being- continued, and this with a view of ascertaining by the appearance of bubbles, whether there be any fissure at which, air enters. The exact tempera- ture of the instrument is not of importance, but the water should, in preference, be milk warm. The apparatus being thus prepared, the operator with his lancet may lay bare, as before, a vein onSOME KEMAUKS ON THE 122 I the fore-arm of the patient, to the extent of an inch at least, taking care to cut down completely through the cellular web, and then, by means of the same instrument, he may, as in the former operation, make a longitudinal incision at least a line in length, and large enough to allow of the ready entrance of the venous tubule to be intro- duced to the extent of two or three lines tho- roughly, but with the utmost gentleness, with its extremity towards the heart. A ligature should not be used. The tubule should be re- tained in its place by the finger of the assistant who holds the arm. The orifice of the tubule should not have a cutting edge After the tubule has been introduced, the chair should be brought close to the edge of the bed; an ounce or two of water should be poured into the cup if void, the syringe should be thrown into action, so as to fill with water the flexible tube which may have drained itself empty, and then the venous tubule, previously inserted into the vein, should, by means of pressure com- bined with a slight serni-rotatory movement, be plugged pretty firmly into the flexible tube, in order to prevent the juncture from burst- ing open when the blood is impelled. After the apparatus has been fitted together in this manner, the person who is to supply the blood takes hisOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 123 seat on the chair; his arm is opened by the lancet as in ordinary venesection; any superfluous water lying in the cup is removed by a piece of sponge; and the blood, instead of being received into a basin in the usual manner, is directed into the cup of the transfusing instrument, and by the play of the syringe, impelled direct into the vein of the patient, without being suffered at any time to accumulate largely in the apex of the cup. As the object of the syringe is merely to give im- pulse, it ought not to be worked by long strokes, but by short and sharp movements, care being taken that the p.lug be every time pushed home, so as to bear down upon the nozzle plate and pre- vent any accumulation in the barrel of the instru- ment. If the syringe be worked in this manner, the blood will be little more exposed when trans- mitted through the impellor, than it is when passing direct from artery to vein by means of a tube; since, in order that the impulse may be given, it is enough that the blood be admitted but a little way into the barrel of the syringe:—those who are acquainted with the principles of hydro- statics, must be aware that the entrance of a few minims would be amply sufficient for this purpose. For supplying blood, men are preferable to women, as they bleed more freely and are less liable to faint. If blood can be procured fromSOME REMARKS ON THE 124 the arms of two persons at once, it would some- times perhaps be desirable. Spirit sufficient to exhilarate and rouse the circulation, may be ad- vantageously given to those who are to furnish the blood before the operation is begun. If the blood, flowing slowly from the arm, show a dispo- sition to clot in the cup, or if the supply of blood fail, the person who furnishes should remove his arm, and a little water poured into the cup of the instrument may be pumped through the syringe so as to displace the blood; thus the apparatus being cleared of blood, will be secured against clot, and kept in a condition to proceed with the operation. If a large bubble of air be absorbed into the syringe, the operation should be sus- pended, the instrument should be separated from the venous tubule, and the blood and air should be cleared, out of the apparatus by immediately pumping through it a few ounces of water, which should be at hand in a small jug furnished with a spout. It would be easy to contrive an instru- ment which would measure the quantity of the blood injected, but I think it better to avoid com- plexities of this kind. Of the quantity of blood thrown in, an opinion may be formed irom the feelings of the person who emits it, or by the size of the stream of blood which flows from the arm, and the continuance of the flow; or by putting wa- ter into the cup after the operation, and workingOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 125 the instrument with the same measured movement, and with the same degree of rapidity, and for the same time as during the operation. The mea- sure of the water passed through the instrument in this manner, will give nearly the measure of the blood transfused. The time during which the operation is continued, should be ascertained by the watch. It is of great importance, in using this instru- ment, that the outer cup be filled thoroughly, so as to cover in the head or upper end of the barrel of the syringe, to the depth of an inch, or an inch and a half at least; as it is this complete submersion of the impelling portion of the appa- ratus, with all its joints and vents, which is the only security against the entrance of air. \ Till it be ascertained (and the affirmative is probable) that human blood may lie out of the vessels for one or two minutes, without material injury, we ought, in operating, to prevent the blood from accumulating in the cup of the instru- ment. Should it, however, be found hereafter, that the blood may be suffered to gather in the cup, without thereby becoming materially un- fitted for its offices in the vessels, then, if this instrument is used at all, it may be proper, dur- ing the operation, to suffer an ounce or more126 SOME REMARKS ON THE of blood to accumulate, in order to prevent more certainly the cup from becoming empty, and thus to preclude the absorption of air. i The miqute dexterity required in managing this instrument may be easily acquired by any person who will accustom himself to pump blood, or even water, through it; and those who are fre- quently performing the operation of venesection must have many opportunities of doing this. When the operation is completed, a pint of wa- ter ought to be immediately worked through the apparatus, in order to clear out the blood, and prevent it from lying in the tubes and becoming- clotted there; and, as soon as occasion serves, the whole should be unscrewed and cleaned out more completely. If the wire-springs which raise the valves are injured, others may be very easily made by giving a piece of wire a spiral form, like that of the spring which has been de- stroyed. If the leather valves are spoiled, others may be made of a piece of soft alum-leather. Both the wire and the leather should be stored in the case for this purpose. The owner of theimpellor ought by all means to make himself master of its structure, and to acquire the little skill which may enable him to set it to rights for himself. Laundy of St. Thomas’s-street, Southwark, now manufactures these instruments.OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 127 Of Transfusion by the Syringe. Should it be found hereafter, by numerous pointed, and therefore decisive experiments and observations, that human blood may lie out of the vessels in the cup for several seconds, without becoming thereby unfit for the vital purposes, there is yet another mode in which transfusion may be accomplished, by the syringe alone, I mean, and this method of operating, if feasible, may be adopted in preference to the preceding, on account of its greater simplicity. In this method of operating a good syringe is required, capable of containing two or three ounces of blood, and furnished with a pipe for the vein, (like that used in the former instrument,) about two inches long, and made to fit by plugging, and a semi-rotatory movement, into the nozzle of the syringe. The blood is to be drawn into a conical vessel, for example, a tumbler, and while flowing into this vessel, held by an assistant, it is to be ab- sorbed into the syringe. When charged, the syringe is to be held with its tubular nozzle up- wards, and the piston is to be pushed slowly on- ward till the blood begins to issue, in order that the air, which from its greater specific levity, willSOME REMARKS ON THE 128 I rise to the upper part of the instrument, may be thoroughly expelled.. The syringe, together with the tubule springing from it, now charged with blood only, is to be slid into the vein of the patient, properly laid open for the purpose, and without delay or hurry the blood is to be in- jected in an equable stream; the operation being repeated as often as the quantity of the blood to be injected may require:—the syringe being of a known capacity will measure the blood. This, with some little improvement, was the method of operating adopted in Brazier’s case, (p. 139.) In this method also Mr. Goodrige operated on his dogs, as before described. The simplicity of the operation, and the portability of the instrument, are its great recommendation. A common syringe, if a good one, might be used in this manner if the emergency were pressing. When the syringe is charged for the first time, air may be previously expelled from the instru- ment by charging it with water. The vein must be laid thoroughly bare, as the cellular web, if not divided completely, will slip over the orifice in the vein, and obstruct the introduction of the instrument ; and the opening must be made sufficiently large and free to allow of the ready entrance of the tube. Perhaps a probe might be passed under the vein with advantage.OPERATION OK TRANSFUSION. 129 Miscellaneous Remarks on Transfusion. It may be objected to transfusion in every shape, that the tube may excite inflammation of the vein. In weighing this and similar objec- tions, however, it should not be forgotten, that in the present state of our knowledge, it is proposed to perform the operation in the most desperate cases only, when it seems to be the sole remain- ing mean of saving the patient’s life. There is much good sense in the familiar maxim of Celsus, and in the present case it is peculiarly applicable; for, surely, it is better to incur the uncertain risk of venous inflammation, than to leave the patient to his fate. Besides, the pipe should not be se- cured in the vein by ligature, but by the pressure of the finger merely, or the blood may be injected by an artery. In the latter case the risk of venous inflammation will be completely obviated, and in the former (probably) it is small. It will, perhaps, be further objected to trans- fusion, that the operation is likely to be obstructed by the coagulation of the blood ; but this objec- tion is unfounded. In the preceding experiments the operation, though performed on the blood of the dog, was not impeded by concretion ; yet K.130 SOME REMARKS ON THE the canine blood coagulates in one-sixth of the time which is necessary for the coagulation of human blood, as the following experiments prove; and it is clear, therefore, that in transfusing hu- man blood, coagulation can furnish no insuperable impediment. 31. I drew off, into a conical wine-glass, about three drachms of blood from ‘the femoral artery of a dog; it began to coagulate in about 10 se- conds, and was completely solid in about 80. In a second experiment which I made, the blood began to coagulate in about 10 seconds (as be- fore), and was completely solid in about 60. 32. A patient being seized with an arterial epistaxis, I collected some of the blood of a bright florid tint. A full minute elapsed before even minute coagula made their appearance, and the blood did not become wholly solid till four or five. 33. A few drachms of venous blood were taken from the arm of a girl liable to attacks of epi- lepsy. It was full 60 seconds before even minute coagula began to make their appearance about the sides of the vessels, and six or seven minutes elapsed before a general coagulation of it took place.OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 131 34. I filled a syringe with blood taken from the same patient as the preceding. When retained there for one minute only, it was found, on expul- sion, to be thoroughly fluid, and it was but slightly inspissated after remaining there for two minutes. That air may enter in conjunction with the blood may also be objected to this operation ; and I have been induced, therefore, to make the following experiments and observations, with a view of ascertaining how far this objection is just. 35. Into the femoral vein of a dog (scarcely larger in the body than a full-sized cat) I threw about five drachms of atmospherical air in the direction of the heart, in quantities of about a drachm at a time ; the whole operation occupy- ing about five minutes. The quantity of the air was measured by means of the syringe. In con- sequence of this operation, dyspnaea was pro- duced, together with irregular action of the heart; the dyspnaea, however, not coming on as soon as the air might be supposed to have entered the heart, but a minute or two afterwards. During this operation the dog sighed deeply, and a slight dyspnaea was produced ; the pulse k 2132 SOME REMARKS ON THE too became unequal, and the muscular system tremulous. As soon, however, as the animal was liberated it leaped from the table, licked its wound, and seemed pleased with caresses. On the following day it was languid and restless, and the muscular tremor continued; the pulse intermitted occasionally, and the dog vomited once. In other respects it appeared tolerably well, took food greedily, and revived completely by the third day. This dog was very delicate ; and the small size of the animal considered, the quantity of the air injected was large; yet all the ' symptoms may be imputed, in part, at least, to the alarm which the operation excited. 36. About three drachms of air were blown from my lungs towards the heart, into the femoral vein of the dog, which had been made the sub- ject of the preceding experiment; the greater part of the air being introduced at once. The respira- tion, circulation, and general health of the animal, seemed to be but little deranged by the experi- ment, even at the time ; and the dog suffered so little subsequent inconvenience, that a day or two afterwards it was led into the country; nor did any urgent symptoms ultimately occur. 37. Mr. Coleby, well known at St. Thomas’s Hospital, procured a large dog, laid bare the fe-OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 133 moral vessels, introduced pipes, with their extre- mities toward the heart, and by means of the impellor, transmitted blood from artery to vein, for several minutes together without ceasing. The syringe used in this operation, of faulty con- struction, was not air-tight, and in consequence a considerable quantity of air was, by little and little, worked into the vessels along with the blood. Before, too, the instrument was put into action, the air was not expelled by charging it with water, so that when the syringe began to play, all the air contained in the tubes, the cylinder, and the barrel of the syringe below the plug, was injected into the animal’s veins. In consequence of this operation, the dog suf- fered a great deal of distress, with frequent and irregular pulse for six or seven days afterwards, at the end of which it was killed and examined, when, as I am informed, a considerable quantity of air was found in the cavities of the heart, mixed up with the blood. These facts considered, then, it seems pro- bable that the entrance of a few drachms of air into the vessels, would be attended with consi- derable distress and even danger ; but it must be recollected, that if the operation be care- fully performed by a competent person, with aSOME REMARKS ON THE 134 proper instrument, there can be no risk, lest air should enter the vessels in large quantities; and the 'probability is, that a bubble or two of air only would occasion little if any inconvenience. It is not objected to the capital operations in surgery, that an unskilful operator may lay open an artery, or that this or other accidents may happen in a moment of negligence even to the most dextrous. In making these experiments on the dog I did not warm the instrument, unless the weather was unusually cold; and though, in the present state of my information, I have recommended tepid water in operating on the human subject, I have a suspicion that heat tends to exhaust the irrita- bility, and destroy what may be called the life of the blood. , i Whether large quantities of water may or not be safely injected into the human vessels, is, I think, uncertain; but there is reason to believe at present that small quantities will occasion no inconvenience, and the injection of small portions only is necessary in performing this operation. Both water, and wine and water, were injected into my dogs without fatal, or even serious con- sequences ; but into this question 1 forbear to enter.OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 135 In pointing to the advantages which belong to transfusion by the syringe, in preference to trans- fusion by the tubule, I shall not enter into details. I refrain, therefore, Irom enlarging on the facility of the operation, or its uses in physiological re- search, and shall content myself with touching on those advantages which appear to be the most important. This operation may be performed with promptitude, for the human blood is al- ways at hand; and the instrument may in many cases be procured in readiness, as the danger of uterine bleedings, at least, may frequently before- seen. Promptitude of operating is an advantage of capital importance ; for there is reason to sur- mise, from the preceding experiments, (4, 5, 6, 7, 8.) that the apparent death of bleeding soon becomes irremediable. Another advantage aris- ing out of this method of operating is, the abund- ance in which the blood may be procured. A dog, below the middle size, and this variety, perhaps, is principally found about our houses, generally dies after it has given off from ten to twelve ounces of blood; but much larger quan- tities of human blood might be obtained on an emergency from the friends of the patient, or for hire. But of all the advantages derived from transfu- sion by the syringe, by far the most important is,136 .SOME REMARKS ON THE' the opportunity it offers of throwing human blood into human veins. There seems reason for pre- suming, from facts already related, that the blood of one class of animals cannot be substituted in large quantities for that of another, with impu- nity; and hence it becomes of the utmost import- ance that we should be able to supply the human vessels with human blood,'—an excellence, which transfusion by the syringe eminently secures. Some Account of Six Cases, in which Injection into the Human Veins was attempted. i i » v I , \ , . • 38. By two gentlemen in my neighbourhood I was called to a case in which a woman was dying, in consequence (as was supposed) of a loss of blood, which occurred during the birth of the placenta. As I entered the room, thirty or forty minutes after the messenger had been dispatched from the house to request my attendance, the pa- tient ceased to respire; and five or six" minutes afterwards, about sixteen ounces of blood pro- cured with ease, by venesection, from two men, (relatives of the patient,) were thrown, by means of a syringe, into the bleeding vein of the arm. No signs of resuscitation were observed. The vein was laid bare with a lancet. The blood was infused without difficulty. The opeTation was137 OPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. performed by the syringe simply, in the mode recommended (p. 127.) 39. A young man, of somewhat muscular make, a patient in Guy’s Hospital, lost a large quantity of blood, from the bursting of an ar- tery, and appeared afterwards, for two or three hours together, to be evidently sinking from in- anition. This patient I was requested to see ; but in consequence of my being from home, on professional business, time was lost, and I could not perform the operation till the man had ceased to respire for three or four minutes. Assisted, however, by a surgeon of talent and enterprize, Mr. Key, I injected sixteen ounces of blood, by means of the impellor, into the bleeding vein, exposed by the lancet; but, with the exception of one single sigh, no signs of returning life were perceptible. An esteemed and intelligent pupil of. mine, Mr. Lord, furnished the blood; and there was no difficulty whatever in obtaining it by venesection as fast as the operation required. In the first of these cases, it will be observed, the syringe was used ; in the second, the impel- lor; and they prove, that in either mode, the operation is of easy performance: both, though indecisive, render it doubtful whether a man can be resuscitated by an injection into the veins,SOME REMARKS ON THE 138 performed three or four minutes after the last respiration. Artificial breathing was not tried. 40. By a friend of mine, on the other side of the water, I was called to a patient, evidently sink- ing from a hemorrhage, which had made its attack during the birth of the placenta, though two or three hours elapsed before death actually occurred. In this case three or four ounces of blood were injected by the syringe, before the respiration ceased, without of course producing any obvious effect, the quantity being small; but as a full supply could not be obtained from the lady who offered to furnish the blood, the operation was necessarily abandoned. Women, it has been ob- served already (p. 123.) are not so capable of sup- plying a sufficient quantity of blood as men are. 41. A lady bled largely for puerperal fever, sank into that state of collapse, which, as men of observation know, is the precursor of certain dissolution. At the request of friends, who were anxious that a remedy,' which promised little, should have a trial, about six ounces of blood, taken from her father by venesection, were in- fused into the bleeding vein, by means of the syringe. Mr. Williams of St. Thomas s-stieet, laid the vein bare with a lancet, and the tubular nozzle of the syringe was repeatedly introducedOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 130 into the vein without any difficulty. No decisive effect of any kind was produced by the operation, and the lady died of the fever, without suffering any extraordinary symptoms. 42. A poor fellow in Guy’s Hospital, (his name was Brazier) between thirty and forty years of age, lay at the point of death, in consequence of the extenuation produced by obstinate vomit- ing, arising, as afterwards appeared, from schir- rosity of the pylorus. At the request of Dr. Cholmley, and the expressed wish of the patient, the late Mr. Henry Cline and myself injected, by means of the syringe, twelve or thirteen ounces of blood into the vein usually laid open in venesection, when no ill symptoms, fairly referrible to the operation, were produced. During the first thirty hours afterwards, there was an increase of the strength, and the man ap- peared mending; but at the end of this period, he began again to sink into a state of collapse, similar to that which had preceded the operation, and died about fifty-six hours after the injection. Not a single bad symptom occurred when the blood was introduced. Could the operation have been repeated, it is not improbable that his life would have been prolonged.* (p. 78.) - » See in Med. Chir. Trans, vol.x. a fuller account of this case.SOME REMARKS OK THE 140 43. A young man, of short stature, but rather broad and muscular, came into Guy’s Hospital, under an attack of hydrophobia, then verging to- wards its close. By the medical officers of the institution, I was requested, in this case, to lend my assistance in performing the operation of Ma- jendie, which consists in the abstraction of some twenty or thirty ounces of blood, and the injec- tion of two or three half-pints of tepid water into the veins, from one to several hours after the bleeding. From this man 1 directed, that thirty ounces of blood should be drawn; but I understand, from the very respectable surgeon, who operated, that after the prescribed measure had been abs- tracted, a further quantity, of uncertain amount, was lost during the pause enjoined by Majendie, between the bleeding and the injection of the water, in consequence of the restlessness of the patient, and the resulting difficulty in securing the orifice of the vein. Thirty or forty minutes after the bleeding, preparation was made for the injection of the water. A surgeon of the hospital prepared the vein, and introduced the tubule ; but it ap- peared at this time so evident that the poor fellow was dying, that those whose office it wasOPERATION OF TRANSFUSION. 141 to decide, deemed it most prudent that the water should not be injected, and in this opinion I thoroughly concurred. By direction of the As- sistant Physician to the hospital, a few drachms of spirit and water were infused, under the hope of raising the circulation, but without producing any decisive effect; and death ensued, with the usual distressing symptoms, about fifty or sixty minutes after the bleeding. The essential part of Majendie’s operation, the injection of water I mean, was not performed here. Death was, I think, accelerated by the largeness of the bleed- ing ; but this may be disputed. Respecting the operation of Majendie, I think it better to give no opinion favourable or repugnant till further infor- mation. Whether it be possible to save a patient, when sinking from hemorrhage, by injecting blood be- fore respiration is stopped, these cases do not enable us to judge; but we may, I think, infer from them, 1st. That transfusion, especially that variety of it, in which the syringe alone is employed (p. 127.) may be performed with facility. 21y. And in the present state of our knowledge, that the operation is not attended with any obvi- ously dangerous symptom, provided the blood be142 OPERATION 'OF TRASFUSION. promptly transmitted, and the injection of air be precluded. Sly. And till we have proof to the contrary, that when a patient has ceased to respire for a few minutes, much is not to be expected from the injection of blood into the veins. What effects might be produced by the injection of venous blood into the common carotid of the right side, towards the coronary arteries, remains to be as- certained. But, to conclude. The preceding paper con- tains all the facts, favourable and unfavourable, which are come to my knowledge, and which seem calculated to help the mind in judging, re- specting the operation of transfusion. On pe- rusing them, every one who is in the habit of reflecting, will, of course, form an opinion for himself: having, however, thought a little on the subject, I may be permitted to state my own per- suasion to be, that transfusion by the syringe is a very feasible and useful operation; and that, after undergoing the usual ordeal of neglect, op- position, and ridicule, it will, hereafter, be ad- mitted into general practice. Whether mankind are to receive the first benefit of it, in this or any future age, from British surgery, or that of fo- reign countries, time, the discoverer of truth and falsehood, must determine.'PLate 1V DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.

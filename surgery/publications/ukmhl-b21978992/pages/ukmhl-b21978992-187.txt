AMPUTATION. J51 fixing the finger, while its palmar surface is tui'ned upwards, forming the flap, and then cutting through the joint When the finger requires to be amputated above this joint, the operation should be performed by making two semilmiar incisions, one on each'side, so as to form two lateral flaps, wliich being dissected back will expose the bone, and allow' it to be divided by the saw, or what is better, the cutting- pliers, The flaps are then made to meet together over the face of the stump. The second phalanx might be removed at the joint in the same way as the first; but as the portion of the finger thus left would be neither useful nor seemly, it is better, imless the patient refuses his consent, to take away the whole of it at its metacarpal articulation. In doing this, while the other fingers are held aside, the surgeon should place the point of his knife exactly over the summit of the joint, and cut first on one side and then on the other, obliquely into the palm of the hand to the point op- posite that from which he set out, taking care to keep exactly in the angle form- ed by the integuments con- necting the fingers. The flaps being detached, he may readily pass the point of his knife round the head of the bone. Lisfranc makes one flap first, then carries his knife through the joint, and completes the operation by cutting outwards When the parts retain their natural laxity, this proceeding k equally easy and expeditious; but if they are thickened and indu- rated, as is generally the case, the second flap is very apt to be in- jimed in detaching the head of the bone; and even in the most fa- vourable circumstances it is much more difiicult to adfipt the flaps properly to each other in this way, than in the one just described. One or two stitches are often useful in keeping the edges of the skin in contoct Of all the operations for amputating fingers this is the most important, from the frequency of cases rcqiuring its ap-

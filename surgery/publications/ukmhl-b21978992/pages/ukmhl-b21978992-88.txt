When the ulcer resists every means employed to induce a heal- ing action, it is generally named a Cancer, the only remedy for wliich is extirpation. This may be effected by caustic and cautery, the ligature, and the knife. The first mentioned means are proper where the sore is of no great depth, or of much extent; the second where hemorrhage might be profuse, and could not be easily re- strained ; the third, or excision, is the easiest, least painful, and most certain method in the great majority of cases.

Specific ulcers show every variety of under-acting and over-acting charac- ters, according to their particular circmnstances, and consequently require a variety of treatment besides that which their peculiar na- ture demands.

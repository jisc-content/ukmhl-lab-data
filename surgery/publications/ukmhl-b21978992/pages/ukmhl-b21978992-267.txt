' The reduction is accomplished in the same 1 v?ay that has just been described, though it 1 has been said to require more force to lift t the head of the bone out of its preternatural ? situation. The dislocation do^vnwards is caused by I heavy bodies falling on the hip, while the I limb is in a state of abduction. The symp- t toms are extremely characteristic, there be- i ing elongation to the extent of an inch and s a half,—abduction, owing to the stretching \ which is suffered by the gluteal muscles,— i and flexion of the thigh on the pelvis, from tthe same cause affecting the iliacits intemus cand psoas magnus. These sjanptoms are coften simulated to a very perplexing extent iby the involuntary obliquity of position which the pelvis acquires f from irritation of the liip-joint, occasioned by blows or other kinds lof external violence ; and inexperienced practitioners are con- 'Sequently apt to commit the mis- take of treating with rough measures ia case that requires those of the most • soothing sort. The best guide in I avoiding this too common error is af- forded by the trochanter major, which, 'when dislocation really exists, will be found by measurement to be more distant from the anterior spinous pro- ■tcess of the ilium than its fellow' is on the other side. The reduction is ac- complished by extending and coun- ter-extending the thigh and pelvis transversely, while the foot of the af- i fected limb is carried inwards under !the sound one. The dislocation forwards on the pu- bis is caused by the body being sud-

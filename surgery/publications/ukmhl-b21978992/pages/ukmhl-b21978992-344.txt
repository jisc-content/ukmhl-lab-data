PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 300 CHAPTER XVII. ABDOMEN. Wounds of the Abdomen. WouNDS of the abdominal parietes, whicii do not penetrate the ])critoneum, require merely the ordinary treatment that is proper for injuries of the class to which they belong. "Wlien the perito- neum is implicated, the wound must be regarded as much more dangerous, since this membrane, like all the others of a serous kind, is very apt to inflame when thus injured. There is seldom much internal hemorrhage in such cases, as the pressure of the vis- cera, which arc conbiined in the cavity of the abdomen, opposes it. . In treating simple penetrating wounds, it is evidently proper, in the first place, to press back any part of the intestines or omentum that may be protruded through the aperture. This should be done as gently and with as little delay as possible. Great care must be tiiken also that the protrusion is not merely returned under the integuments, without being fairly restored to the abdominal cavity, especially if the wound be oblique and narrow, as when inflicted by a pointed instrument In cases of this sort it has happened that the inner opening of the wound so compressed the intestines, or omentum, permitted to remain in it, under the erroneous impression that reduction had been completely eflPected, as to cause fatal inflammation. The surgeon, therefore, should follow the pro- truded parts with his finger, and not be satisfied with their re- placement until he feels the point of it within the peritoneum, en- larging the wound, if necessary, by means of a probe-pointed bistoury. It is more particularly necessary to observe this pre- ciiution when any swelling remains at the seat of injury, or the protrusion tends to reapj)ear after being pressed within the ex- ternal orifice of the wound. I once successfully reduced a mass of omentum of the size of a walnut, that lay in an oblique wound, of which the inner aperture was not larger than a small quill. The

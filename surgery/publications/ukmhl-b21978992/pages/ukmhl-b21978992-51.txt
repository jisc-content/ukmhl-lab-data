INFLAMMATION. 19 apt to mislead, it is better merely to suspend the limb in the steam, and place a vessel below it to receive the blood. Some timorous patients mil not allow themselves to be bled ex- cept from the superficial veins on the back of the hand, and the ope- ration may be performed there very easily, though not very effi- ciently. Arteriotomy.—The only artery now ever opened, intentionally for the abstraction of blood is the temporal, blither its anterior or mid- dle branch may be selected, but the former is the most convenient; and the best part of its course for the purpose is just where it be- gins to be covered by the hairs of the head, a few of wliich ought to be shaved off previous to the operation. The artery is sometimes so large and superficial that it may be opened in the same way as a vein; hut, in general, this method would not succeed, as the small size and depth of the vessel render it extremely difficult to avoid either cutting its coats entirely across or pricking them slightly, in both of which cases the blood does not flow freely. Many plans have been proposed to obviate this difficulty, but the simplest and surest is to place the point of the fore and middle fingers over the artery so as to ascertain and mark its course—then to make an oblique in- cision about half an inch long with a lancet through the integu- ments over the vessel where it lies between the fingers—and lastly, to introduce the instrument gently again and again until the blood ■ springs out The operation may also be rendered more certain by using a small cupping-glass having an oval aperture fitted to the sliape of the temporal region; even if the artery should have been completely divided, this means will induce the blood to flow from it. ; To stop the hemorrhage a firm compress of lint should be placed on the wound, and then a bandage a yard or two long, and an inch broad, rolled up at each of its extremities, being applied first to the opposite side of the head, should be brought round and crossed over the artery, after which its ends are to be carried back again in the opposite direction, and this repeated until sufficient pressure is ef- fected. Effects of Bleeding.—The first effect noticed is a diminution in the force and I’apidity of the circulation, wluch is manifested by the pulse becoming slower and softer. By-and-by the motion of the icart is so much weakened that it no longer propels the blood with sufficient force to support the functions of tlie brain. The indivi- huil becomes pale—he complains of weakness and nausea, wluch sometimes proceeds to vomiting, but more frequently, the functions

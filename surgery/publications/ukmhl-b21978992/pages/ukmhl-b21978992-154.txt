118 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. quently repeated depletion during the first few days, after which the strictest abstinence must be enjoined, to maintain and increase the efiect thus obtained. Aneurism by Anastomosis. Mr John Bell described, under the title of Aneurism by Anas- tomosis, a subcutaneous tumour, which possessed a flattened shape, a doughy consistence, and a cellular structime, communicating very freely with the branches of neighbouring arteries, so that it pulsat- ed or throbbed obscurely, and bled most profusely when opened by incision, though when the morbid structure was cut entirely out there was not any more hemorrhage than might have been expect- ed from the vessels of the paiâ€™t Mr Bell regarded this formation as composed of cells with which the veins and arteries freely com- municated, and into which the blood was induced to flow with ex- traordinary force. The tendency of aneurism by anastomosis be- ing to enlarge, open, and bleed, ]\lr Bell recommended complete atid speedy excision as the only and essential remedy for it. More recent and extended observation lu\s not only thrown light upon the nature of this tumour, but also proved that there are others of an analogous kind which shoidd be arranged along with it; and the term of INIorbid Erectile Tissue has been employed as the general title for denoting them. Every part of the capillary system probably has the pow'er of inducing blood to enter it, and those portions of the body which, being distinguished by a remarkable degree of this property, are said to be formed by erectile tissue, as the penis, nipple, or wattles of the turkey-cock, in all pro- bability exercise a similar pow'er in a similai- manner, but only on a 'greater scale, propor- tioned to the developement of their structure.- Instead, therefore, of regarding them as coristi- tuted by distinct cells interposed between the veins and arteries, it seems more reasonable to suppose that they consist merely of a dilatation, as it were of the capillary vessels. In some animals the natural ei'ectile tissue is evidently formed in this way, as, for instance, the glans penis of the ram and fidlow' deer, of which this is a representation, and there are a fc\v cases

PELVIS. 329 CHAPTER XVIII. PELVIS. Imperforate Anus. Deficiency or imperforation of the anus is a congenital disease, and exlubite several varieties which must be distinguished in prac- tice. Sometimes the rectum is completely formed, with the ex- ception of having its orifice closed by a thin membrane, which al- lows the dark colour of the meconium to be discerned through it This obstruction, instead of existing at the extremity of the gut, may he situated a little above it, so as to require the introduction of a finger or probe for its discovery. The rectum is also occa- sionally foimd to be deficient at its lower part, becoming nearly or altogether imjiervious at the distance of an inch or more from where the anus ought to be. In such cases, there is not unfre- quently a communication between the intestine above the obstructed part and the vagina of the female, or the urinary bladder of the male, the former of which complications lias sometimes proved suf- ficient for affording passage from the bowels during the course of a long life. The symptoms of imperforate anus are swelling and tension of the abdomen, vomiting, and absence of the usual evacuations from the bowels. If the child is not relieved by having an aperture ef- fected for the escape of the confined feculent matters, it mnst speedily perish,â€”and an examination of the rectum should there- fore be always instituted without delay, when there are symjitoms indicative of obstruction, and more especially when there is no discharge of meconium. In case of simple closure, without deficiency of the gut, the membrane should be punctured, and then freely divided in a cru- cial direction with a probe-pointed bistoury or scissors, guided on the finger. To prevent contraction of the wound, it will be ne- cessary to introduce daily, until the cure be completed, a large

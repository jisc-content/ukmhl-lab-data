BUUSAL SWELLING OP WHIST AND PALM OP HAND. 29 effect of sucli a procedure, which \vas so satisfactory as at once to establish the operation. Its results in my own practice, and that of others, have, so far as I know, been uniformly successful. The easiest mode of operation is to puncture the swelling a little above or below the annular ligament, then introduce a blunt-pointed curved bistoury under the arch, and, lastly, divide it together with the superjacent integuments. Light and superficial dressing are sufficient in the first instance; and if the swelling does not speedily subside, one or two blisters may be applied. PxVRACENTESIS THORACIS. A great improvement has been introduced into the evacua- tion of fluid contained in the cavity of the pleura by substitut- ing for the incision and tube or large trocar, formerly employed on such occasions, a very small instrument of the last men- tioned kind, which is at once thnist through the parietes of the chest, and allows the pent-up matter to escape in a slender stream, or only by drops. There is thus no risk of any bad consequences, so that, if the patient's case does not admit of improvement, it is at least rendered no Avorse, Avhile many instances of complete success might bo quoted. One patient w'ho Avas under my care had nearly 600 ounces of fluid re- moved at different times, Avithout once being subjected to a day's confinement, and afterwards enjoyed such good health as to enter into the married state. CYSTS OF THE JIAMMA. When the tumour depends upon a single cyst the treatment recommended by Sir B. Brodie may be adopted. It consists of evacuating the fluid by a small puncture, and applying a stimulating embrocation on the surface, Avith the vicAv of counteracting the tendency to effusion. Troublesome conse- quences are apt to result from this procedure when the punc- ture is effected by means of a lancet, or any similar instrument.

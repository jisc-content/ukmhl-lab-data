Purgatives.—These are substances that, when introduced into the intestinal canal, produce more or less irritation : the effect of which is a greater secretion from the mucous membrane, and increased contrac- tion of the muscular fibres. In conse- quence of this double operation, the de- jections are more frequent and copious than usual ; and the patient is not only relieved in the way of metastasis, that is from having an action excited at a dis- tance from the diseased one, but also has those secretions restored, the suppression of which is frequently the indirect cause of inflammation. Many different purgatives are employed in medicine; but the most useful in suMuing inflammation are calomel, colocynth, jalap, rhu- barb, croton oil, and sulphate of magnesia. The saline pm’gatives induce a very copious secretion from the whole siudace of the intes- tines, while calomel is thought to act more particidarly on the li- ver, by restoring or promoting its secretion. The blue pill and rhubarb are very beneficial in gradually restoring these actions to a state of health when their disturbance has occasioned chronic in- flammation. Pm-gative agents are often introduced into the rectum with the view of hastening the effect of those administered by the mouth, or superseding the necessity of their use, when from any circum- stance their employment happens to be inconvenient The grand essential of these injections, clysters, or enemata, as they are nam- ed, is quantity sufficient to ^stend the rectum, since tliis is the proper stimulus of that giit From one to two pounds of gruel, or simply tepid water, should be used, and made more or less irritat- ing, according to circumstances, by the addition of common sfdt, olive oil, castor oil, sulphate of magnesia, or oil of turpentine, &c.

PRINCITLES OF SURGERY. CHAPTER XII. JOINTS. Sprains and Bruises. The Hgamentoiis tissue is not liable to pain excited by the or- dinary stimuli which occasion it in other parts; but though insen- sible to cutting and tearing, it suffers severely fiâ€™om being over- stretched, in conformity with the general law, that the sensibility of parts bears some relation to their use in the animal economy. The articular cartilages and lining synovial membrane again suf- fer from violent compression. The symptoms and effects, primary as well as secondary, which proceed from these two sources, are very similar. Joints of the ginglymoid or hinge-like structure, and those of the arthrotlia kind, such as the tarsal and carpal articula- tions, are exposed to the first-mentioned injury, wliile the ball and socket joints, though nearly exempt from it, are subject to bruises from their respective surfaces being squeezed together. Both strains, or sprains as they are called, and bruises are attend- ed in the first instance with severe sickening pain, and more or less complete inability of exercising the joint To these symptoms suc- ceed swelling, tension, and, if the joint is superficial, discoloration from ccchymosis, and not unfrequently intiammation, particularly if the patient possesses a scrofulous or otherwise irritable consti- tution. The inflammation, when chronic, leads to tliickening and adhesions of the articular ajjparatus, which occasion deformity and lameness, or morbid degenerations of the same part, which frequent- ly end in the destruction of the joint; when acute, it tends to sup- pimation. The immediate effects of these injmdes are always dis- tressing, and their secondary consequences, though not certainly serious, are generally inconvenient, and often destructive of the limb. Such accidents, therefore, ought always to be treated with attention, so that nothing may be neglected in any way calculated to guard against bad consequences to the joint.

420 I’RINCII’I.F.S OF SURGERY. CHAPTER XX. BRAIN, SPINAL MARROW, AND NERVES. Injuries of the Brain and its Coverings. Concussion, or a violent shock, may act injuriously both on the brain and the parts which enclose it, either separately or toge- ther. It occasions at one time rupture or laceration, and at an- other merely disturbance in the \dtal action. In botli cases it is apt to excite inflammation, and then, besides its primary effects, produces very important secondary ones. Concussion of the brain is caused by blows on the head, or hy falling in such a position, as prevents the force of the shock from being diffused over a number of intermediate articulations, before reaching the head. The effect of blows on the head in producing concussion is proportioned to their force, the flatness of the surface applied to the skull, and the resistance it makes. The symptoms of the injury vary with the degree of it. If there is no laceration of the cerebral substance or membranes, the patient merely suffers a temporary diminution or suspension of the functions of the organ. In very slight cases, there is confusion of ideiis, and weakness of the voluntary muscles, which last only a few minutes. When the shock has been more severe, the patient is quite insensible; his pulse is small and irregular ; his breathing is slow and feeble; his pupils are fixed, generally in a contracted, but sometimes dilated state, and there is occasional vomiting. This condition seldom lasts beyond ten, or at the most, twenty minutes, and is succeeded by a return to health, which either continues, or terminates in in- flammation. When the concussion has caused laceration of the cerebral substance, the insensibility is of longer duration; and when at the end of some hours, or it may be a day or more, the patient begins to give signs of returning consciousness, he recovers very imperfectly, and only for a short interval before Inflammation

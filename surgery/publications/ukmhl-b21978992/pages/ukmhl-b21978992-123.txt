BLOOD-VESSELS. 91 "WTien the artery wounded is of lai’ge size, it must be tied both above and below the opening, as the anastomosing branches would otherwise maintain the hemorrhage from the inferior orifice. If it is necessary, in order to apply the ligatures, to expose the artery more fully, this should if possible be done by dilating the origmal wound, since there is apt to be much difficulty in finding the aper- ture when the surgeon cuts down on a different side of tl;e vessel I from that which is punctured. I In tying an artery which has bled repeatedly, it is necessary to beware of mistaking for the orifice of the vessel a fibrinous cylin- drical extension of it, the ligature of which could not produce any permanent or beneficial efiect Pressure may, on many occasions, be employed to suppress hemor- rhage more conveniently than the ligature, as when the artery is but small, or lies over some unyielding part which can aflfonl good counter-pressure,—or is much branched and freely connected with neighbomring arteries of large size, so that several orifices would require to be tied,—when, it is situated so deeply that the ligature could not be applied without a serious operation,—air is in a state of ulceration. In w'ounds of the hands and feet, especially the palms of the fonner, and soles of the latter, no method is so convenient for stopping bleeding as pressure. Lint or sponge may be employed to effect tbe pressure ; but the former is on many accounts preferable. Folded portions of it, successively increased in size, constituting what are called graduated compresses, ought to be aj)plied over the bleeding vessel, and secured by a proper bandage. Unless tbe first one is placed directly on the orifice of the artery, the subsequent pieces, however firmly compressed, will have little effect, and there- fore the wound should if necessary be dilated sufficiently to admit the lint When the hemorrluige takes place into a cavity, tlie parietes of which are finn and unyielding, it may sometimes be restrained by closing the outlets, so as to make the blood accumidate, and press iq)ou the orifices whence it issues. Thus epistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, may be arrested, and also hemorrhage from the ute- rus in the early months of pregnancy, by plugging the nosti’ils and vagina. Bleeding from a leech-bite may be arrested by transfixing the wound with a sewing needle, and tying a thread tightly round it In the same way was subdued a hemorrhage from the umbili- cus of an infant, two weeks old, which I saw with Dr Begbie, and where the actual cautery had been used in vain, at the suggestion of the late Dr Hamilton, who said that the very few cases of the same

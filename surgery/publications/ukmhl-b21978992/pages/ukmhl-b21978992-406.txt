362 rRIXCIPLES OF SURGERY. ter abstinence from drinking, or profuse perspiration. It generally appears in the form of a light-coloured yellowish cloud, occupying the lower part of the vessel, or in that of a thin crust or lining, which adheres to its sides. When chemically examined, the Kght- coloured muddy-looking sediment is found to consist of alkaline and earthy salts, which are chiefly the phosphate of lime, and the triple phosphate of magnesia and ammonia,—the lateritious or crust- ed deposit, on the contrary, consisting of uric acid, or lirate of am- monia with an excess of acid. In consequence of a variety of cir- ciunstanccs which will he more particularly considered hereafter, the urine becomes loaded with these matters in quantities, propor- tions, and combinations, that give rise to concretions of various kinds. It appears that the fluid is sometimes secreted so overbur- dened with its acid or saline constituents, as to deposit them imme- diately on escaping into the pelvis of the kidney, and form concre- tions, consisting by far most frequently of uric acid, but sometimes of the oxalate of lime. If the urine is not so loaded as to free itself immediately after being secreted, it does not afford any dej)Osition so long as it is kept within the body and maintained at its tempe- rature ;—but when it is excreted and cooled down to the tempera- ture of the air, it deposits all the redundant portion in the form of a copious muddy yellowish-white precipitate, containing the earthy salts,—and a lateritious crust consisting of the acids and acidulous combinations of ammonia. If, however, while such an excess of the urinary constituents exists, a foreign body should be present in the bladder or in any other part of the passage through which the urine flows, so as to serve as a nucleus for concretion, it will, on the well known principle observed to regulate the separation of salts from their solvents, whether in a crystallized form or not, induce the re- dundant matters to withdraw themselves from the attraction of the fluid, and adhere to the surface which is presented to them. This effect, however, can occur oidy where there is a considerable excess of Sevline substance, since, w’hen the proportion is small, it is retain- ed in solution by the urine at the high temperature which it has in the bladder, too powerfully to permit its precipitation by the influ- ence of a foreign body. Urinary calculi which have attained any considerable size are hence found to consist of concentric layers, varying in com])Osition and thickness, according to the nature and quantity of the morbid excess that existed in the urine at the time of their formation; and, for the same reason, the ra])idity with

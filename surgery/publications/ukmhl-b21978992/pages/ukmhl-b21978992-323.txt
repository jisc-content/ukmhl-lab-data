THROAT. 279 dicine to promote absorption (1820), it has been very generally employed both internally and externally for this pimpose. Along with such external applications the tincture of iodine or the hydrio- date of potass may also be given internally. The internal use of burnt sponge, wliich was formerly considered the grand specific for bronchocele, has gone nearly into disuse since iodine came to be regarded as its active principle in exciting the action of the absor- bents. Under this treatment, the tumour generally suffers some diminution; and occasionally, but unfortunately very rarely, is re- duced to the natural size. When the case ceases to improve, or is obstinate from the commencement, the patient should be dissuaded from subjecting himself to any more severe expedients unless liis existence should be threatened or rendered seriously uncomfortable by the presence of the swelling. The headach, which occasionally proves a distressing attendant of the disease, is sometimes much al- leviated by the application of a few leeches to the temples from time to time. When the enlargement is found to depend on the presence of a cyst it should be punctured, and liave a seton passed through its sides, or be injected with diluted tincture of iodine, as in the case of hydrocele.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 34 wine and spirits. Bark used to be thought a sort of specific for supporting the system under tiiis trial, but it is now less trusted to, and if given at all, the sidphate of quina is the preparation of it wliich ought to be preferred. When the mortification does not cease to extend, it comes to be a question whether or not the simgeon ought to interfere with the knife. The objection to doing so is, that, though the constitutional symj)toms may be alleviated, or altogether removed for a time after the amputation, the patient is in general soon reduced to the same stiite by sloughing of the cut surface. The most prudent course seems to be a middle one; to abstain from amputation when the mortification depends upon an internal cause, or one that eannot be removed, and to operate when the cause is external or within reaclu In the case of (jangrena senilis, it would therefore be improper, w'hile in spreading mortification occurring as a consequence of gim- shot wound or compound fracture, the patient should be afforded this chance of escape from otherwise certain destruction. It does not follow from this rule, however, that amputation should alw'ays be performed when mortification of a limb ensues from external irrita- tion, since the most trivial injury is sufficient to induce it in an un- healthy subject. It is only when the violence of the action is fairly referable to the local cause, without supposing consti- tutional defect, that the operation can be practis- ed with propriety. Though the extent of mortifica- tion is not defined, if it de- j)ends u])on a cause Avhich is limited in its operation, as the obstruction of an ar- tery at some ascertained part of its course, the jjro- priety of amjjutation w ill be still more manifest. In those cases where the mortification spontaneous- ly ceases to extend, (Fig. 1.) as when it results from the exposure of a part to cold, it often becomes a question

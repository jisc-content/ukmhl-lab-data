BLOOD-VESSELS. 129 any pulsation of the artery below the pai’t where it is wounded, while it pulsates above more forcibly tlum it did before. Dr Him ter first described this disease, (1756,*) but Dr Cleghorn of Dublin suggested the name which is used to denote it,f (1765.) It is most apt to occur at the bend of the arm, where the median basilic vein lies over the humeral artery, but may do so in any part of the body where a-large artery and vein are contiguous. In- stances of it have been observed in the femoral, popliteal, carotid, and subclavian vessels, from wounds. Aneurismal varix is generally more inconvenient than dange- rous, the veins, after they become fully distended, usually remain- ing without any farther change. It is, therefore, seldom necessary to do more than apply a bandage to the limb, with a compress over the injured part Should the swelling, pain, or other symptoms of the case be so severe as to warrant an operation, a radical one may be performed by tying the wounded artery both above and below the opening. Varicose Aneurisnu Wlien, in the case of a vein and artery communicating, the blood issues from the latter ves- sel into the cellular substance, so as to constitute a false aneurism, and at the same time continues to gain access to the vein, a com- bination of ane;u-ism and aneu- rismal varix results, wliich has been named Varicose Aneurism. A good idea of tliis curious com- plication of derangement will be obtained from this representa- tion of the disease, affecting the aorta and vena cava. It origi- nated spontaneously, and was the first instance of this kind record- ed,J though others have beeu no- ticed since I published the case. With few exceptions, the bend of the arm lias been the seat of this • Med. Obs. and Inquiries, Vol. i. p. 340. f Ibid. Vol. iii. p. 110. } Ed. Med. and Surg. Journal, Vol. xxxvi. p. 104. I

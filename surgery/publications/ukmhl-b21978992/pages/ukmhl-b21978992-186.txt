But oc- casionally the exfoliation is much more extensive, as in the second tigime, wliich is taken from one that separated in a case of amputation above the elbow on account of shattering of the arm by machinery. Particular Amputations. The fingers may be amputated either at the joints or through the phalanges. Tliere used to be a strong prejudice against leaving an arti- cular sm-face, the cartilage of which wjxs thought to exfoliate necessarily, so tis to render the cure more tedious and troublesome. Disiu*ticulation was therefore avoided as much as possible, and when, from any circumstance, it appeared to be uievitable, the precaution wjis taken of scraping off the articulating cartilage. It is now well ascertained that union by the first in- tention generally oeexms as readily after disar- ticulation, as after amputation through the shafts of bones, and that when it does not take place, the only inconvenience experienced from thecar- tihige is a little increase and longer continuance of the irritation. The stvmip swells and discharges thin sero-purulent fluid in considerable quan- tity, often together with small scales of ciudi- lage floating out from the canty. Such being the case, though it would be wrong to ampu- tate tbrough a joint by j)reference, still, when there is any lasting advantage to be gained by- doing so, the chance of bad consequences, so trivial as those just mentioned, ought not to be regarded as a sufficient objection to it. When the distal phalanx alone of a finger is affected, it ought to be removed by cutting into the joint on the dorsid surface, dividing the lateral ligaments, and then csirry ing the knife forwards ])arallel with the palmar surface of the bone so as to sjive a flap to cover the stump: Or the operation may be reversed by trans-

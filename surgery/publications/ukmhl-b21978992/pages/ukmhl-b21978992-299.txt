The after- rreatment requires no particular attention beyond a moderately ab- ttemious :*egimen,—avoiding bright light,—exercising the eyes •-■qually,—and not employing them in reading or any minute work. i\^t the end often days or a fortnight, if any obliquity is found to re- tnain, or to have returned, it will be a question, whether the rectus of he other eye should be divided, or the muscle already operated on hould be cut a second time. In deciding as to this I tliink the lest guide is the effect produced by closing the sound eye. If it is ■ound to be altered in its position by doing so, and to present ub- iquity w'hen suddenly exposed by opening the eyelids, the rectus oncenied in producing this effect may properly be divided. But fit remains straight, the operation should be repeated on the squint- ■ag eye, in the hope, that the antagonist muscle, being afforded a se- cond opportunity of contracting, will do so more effectually than on liie first occasion. In the course of two or three weeks after the iperation, a warty-looking excrescence frequently grows from the cat of the wound, and requires to be cut away by dividing its neck, • liich is small and almost thread-like, with a pair of curved scissors; 'r, to render this unnecessary, the nitrate of silver may be applied ccasionally until the conjunctiva is com})letely healed. If left 0 itself, the growth, after gradually indurating, ultimately drops off vrom atrophy of the nutrient vessels. i u 1

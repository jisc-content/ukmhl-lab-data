PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 472 CHAPTER XXIII. MOUTH. Salivary Gkmds. The ducts both of the parotid and submaxillary glands are liable to become the seat of calcareous concretions, which are named Sa- livary Calculi. Their composition is phosphate of lime, agglutinat- ed by a small quantity of animal matter. They have usually a yellowish-white colour, oval figure, and finely tubercidated surface. They vary in size from that of a millet-seed, to that of an almond with the shell. In the parotid duct, they are very rarely met with, but in the submaxillary one not unfrequently. They occasion pain, swelling, and hardness, and sometimes impede the flow of the saliva, or give rise to the formation of an abscess. In the parotid duct, the symptoms thus produced are apt to be confounded with those of rheumatism, toothache, gum-boil, or suppuration of the maxillary antrum; while under the tongue they may be occasionally mistaken for those of encysted tumours. In all cases of doubt, it is right to search the duct with a probe, and to feel for the calculus, by pres- sing on the place where it is suspected to be. So soon as a free incision is made, the concretion escapes, together with the fluid ac- cumulated about it. The usual situation of these concretions is immediately within the orifice of the ducts; but they have also been found imbedded in the substance of the submaxillary gland, Avhere they excited an increased and unhealthy secretion, with ge- neral swelling and hardness of the gland. In such cases the cal- culus, if distinctly recognized, may be extraeted by cutting down upon it, from the mouth, wliich I have had occasion to do. WTicu the Parotid duct is included in a wound of the cheek, unless the edges of the integuments be very closely approximated, a sivlivary fistula is apt to remain at the part. In case it should take place, the patient will labour under the double annoyance of dryness of the mouth during mastication, and a discharge of fluid

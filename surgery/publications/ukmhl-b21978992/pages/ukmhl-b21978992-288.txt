rniMCIPLES OF SUnCERY. 2i6 4 rupted suture, and then a long bandage must be applied in the figure of 8 to support the limb, which should be bent at a right angle, and to prevent the ends of the bones from moving, or press- ing injm’iously on the soft parts. Rigid cases of iron or wood have been proposed for this pimpose, but they are found to be in all re- spects less convenient than the means just mentioned The patient after the first two or three days will find himself most comforhible in the erect posture; and when the inflammatory tension consequent upon the operation begins to subside, he should gently but diligent- ly exercise the limb so as to preserve the mobility of the elbow. The cases admitting this operation are much more frequent than those proper for excision of the shoulder-joint. Having adopted the practice when it was almost entii’ely neglected in this country— where, indeed, I am not aware of its having been ever previously performed on the living body—and emj)loyed it very extensively as well as successfully, I feel great pleasure in contemplating the benefit that has been derived from its introduction into general use. If the patient, from weakness, seems unable to bear a protracted discharge, or if the bones are found excavated or diseased beyond the limits of the articulating extremities, the bmb should be removed.

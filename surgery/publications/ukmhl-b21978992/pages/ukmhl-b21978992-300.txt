PRINCiri.ES OF SURGERY. 258 CHAPTER XIV. TENDONS. Injuries of the Tendons. Wounds.—Tendons are sometimes cUvidecl by cutting-instni- ments, the immediate consequence of which is loss of power of the muscles concerned. It was formerly the custom to sew the cut sur- faces of the tendon together; but this practice is now abandoned, and the only means employed in addition to those which the wound of the integuments requires, consist in carefid attention to the po- sition of the limb, in order to relax the muscle connected with the injured tendon, and prevent as much as possible the separation of its extremities. When the tendon is of a large size, such as the tendo Achillis, lateral compresses are useful in keeping the surfaces opposed to each other. It is ascertained that though the extremi- ties remain considerably distant, they arc still united together through the medium of a new formed substance, the result of an interstitial process of reproduction. This part is sometimes thinner, sometimes thicker than the original tendon, but always inconvenient by causing relaxation of the muscle, and consequent diminution in the effect of its contractile power. The surgeon, therefore, should do every thing in his })owcr to render the bond of union as narrow as possible. In cases where the wound has been allowed to heal, with such separation of the extremities of the tendon as renders the patient lame, it may be warrantable to cut out the intennediate substance, and sew the ends of the tendon together, as 1 once did with success in a Ciise where the te7ido Achillis had been divided and allowed to heal with great retraction.* Rupture.—Tendons may be torn either by external violence, or by inordinate contraction of their own muscles. In the former Ccisc they are most a])t to give way where the muscular fibres are attach- Efl. Med. and Surg. Journal. Report of Surgical Case.s, 1835.

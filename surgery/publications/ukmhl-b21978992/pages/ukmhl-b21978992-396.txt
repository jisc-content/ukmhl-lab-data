If there were no other method of treatment equally efficient, it would be right to remedy, so far as possible, the defects that still remain in these apparatus, and ac- quire, by diligent practice, the art of employing them dexterously; but this will seem unnecessary when the method of treatment by Dilatation has been explained. Division of the stricture by incision has been proposed and prac- tised at various times, both by cutting through the integuments, and by introducing a cannula with enclosed lancet blade, which may be protruded after the sheath has been conveyed down to the stricture. Mr Stafford has advocated this operation, and improv- ed it by the invention of ingenious instruments for its performance; but the objections which have been alleged to the caustic apply still more strongly to such a mode of treatment, since it can never be safe, even in the hands of the most expert operator. Dilatation has been long employed to remove strictures of the urethra, and even before it was known to be the cause of amend- ment When fleshy excrescences were regarded as the source of obstruction, bougies, armed with caustic, or medicated, as it was termed, with various ingredients believed to have the power of pro- moting absorption, were introduced into the passage. The caus- tic no doubt produced its peculiar effects, but the other materials were found at length to be quite useless; and it became apparent that the good effects, which attended their employment, depended entirely upon the mechanical pressure of the instrument. Though the direct effect of a bougie is merely mechanical, the removal of the stricture depends on a vital process which is thus excited, and not on simple stretching. The pressure excites interstitial absorp- tion of the thickened walls of the canal, and hence it is, that when an instrument of a certain size has been passed with difficulty, a larger one can often be readily introduced by a subsequent at- tempt a few days afterwards. Such being the mode in which be- nefit is derived from the use of simple bougies in the treatment of stricture, it is evident that they must be employed so as to pro- duce merely such a degree of irritation, as is sufficient for giving rise to absorption, since more than this might be apt to occasion interstitial effusion instead of absoq)tion, and aggravate the stric- ture instead of relieving it The bougies, therefore, should not be introduced too frequently, or too forcibly, or for too long a time; and their use should not be persisted in when the parts or sys-

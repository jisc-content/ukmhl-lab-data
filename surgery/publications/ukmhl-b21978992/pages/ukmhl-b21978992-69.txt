EFFUSION. 37 CHAPTER III. EFFUSION. Effusion of Serum. The action or process which is denoted by the expression Ef- fusion, consists in the separation of the serous, or fibrinous portion of the blood, and its discharge into some part of the body. Effusion is not necessarily preceded by inflammation, but is very frequently a conseqiience of it It has already been remarked, that a slight degree of eflusion almost always attends inflammation. Serous effusion takes place chiefly into the interstices of the sub- cutaneous cellular textoe, and into the cavities which are lin- ed with serous membranes, as the pleura, or peritoneum, and the joints. In the fonner situation, it occasions a swelling of the part affected, which is smooth, coloimless, unless inflammation exists, and pits on pressmre. This is Oedema or Anasarca, It occupies those parts which are most dependent, especially the inferior extre- mities and the scrotum, and changes its place with the position of the body. In the serous sacs it constitutes collections of fluid, which are named Dropsies. The fluid, both of oedema and dropsy, generally bears a close resemblance to, or rather seems identical with, the serum of the blood. Sometimes it is more limpid and colourless, tinged with blood or bile, more watery, or loaded with a larger proportion of i albumen. Serous effusion is induced in the cellular texture and serous sacs 1 by various circumstances. It is often observed distinctly as a con- i sequence of inflammation, but in this case the serous sacs are chief- l ly concerned. It very frequently results from the venous circulation being impeded either by the mere posture of the body or obstruction of the vessels, or from disease of the heart or liver, or the presence of a tumour compressing the veins, of which pregnancy frequently affords an example in causing oedema of the limbs. It also by no

Collections of matter are sometimes formed in the iliac or in- guinal regions, lying betw'een the parietes of the abdomen and the peritoneum. As the gut on the right side is in this situation partly uncovered with peritoneum, there is a risk of ulcerative absorption being induced in its coats by the pressure of the confined fluid, so as to form a preternatural opening into the caput ccecum, which may become a stercoraceous fistula if the Integuments also give way. To prevent this occurrence, it is right in such cases to make an early aperture. This complaint is met with most frequently in females soon after delivery, but is not confined to this condition ; and I have even met with it, though certainly very seldom, in pa- tients of the other sex. The abscess is generally of a subacute character, and, from its insidious formation, is apt to escape recog- nition.

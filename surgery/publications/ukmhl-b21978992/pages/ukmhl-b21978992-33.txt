PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. CHAPTER I. INFLAMMATION. intuoductioN. w ITU the exception of the cuticle and its appendages, tlie nails and hairs, wliich are destitute of vessels and incapable of perform- ing any vital action, dll the solid part of the human body is com- posed of vascular tissues, which consist of blood-vessels and nerves interwoven together through a basis of cellular sulistance. These tissues arc everywhere permeated by the blood, which supplies them with nourishment for their growth and renovation. Some of them, as those of wliich the bones and ligaments are formed, seem to ]>er- forra no living action, but that of duly appropriating the nutritious matter thus afforded, so as to preserve their structure in a healthy or perfect state, and this is named their Nutritive Action. Other tissues, as the muscular and glandular, in addition to the power of nutrition, possess various remarkable vital properties, wliich are named theii' Functions. Both the nutritive and functional actions of the tissues are sub- ject to disorder. When the fonner are peiwerted, alteration of the structure necessarily results, as is seen in the growth of tumours or the formation of ulcers; but the latter may be disturbed without any obvious change of this kind, as when the digestion of food or the secretion of urine is imperfectly performed, without any percep- tible difference in the stomach or kidney. Derangement of func- tion, however, is no doubt most frequently connected with alteration of structure, and is very apt to lead to it Disordered action, whe- ther of function or nutrition, constitutes Disease, to remedy which is the object of Medicine.

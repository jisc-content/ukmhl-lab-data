Chronic Cutaneous Diseases. Under the title of Cutaneous Diseases may be comprehended a great number of affections, apparently very dissimilar from each other, but which are found to differ chiefly in appearance, and in general to agree very closely in regard to the cause of their pro- duction, as well as the mode of their remedy. They all consist .in the existence of some chronic preternatural condition of the skin, and have been arranged into divisions, according to the nature of it. Of these the most imporhint are the Papular, in which the sur- face is elevated into little pimples,—the Pustular, which consist in small collections of matter—the Vesicular, in which the cuticle is elevated by small quantities of fluid effused under it,—and the Squamous, in which the cuticle is rendered thick and scaly. The species and varieties of these different kinds, and others that have been noticed, are so numerous, that the most concise description of their distinctive characters woidd require far more space than can be afforded for the purpose in this work, to which, it may be ob- served, they do not strictly belong, since, though external in their situation, they are remedied chiefly by mternal means. They originate in the first instance, with few exceptions, from constitutional distm’bance, but frequently become so naturalized to the system, as to continue after the derangement that gave rise to them has ceiised to exist Disorder of the digestive organs is the grand source of their production, and they may be regarded as bearing the same relation to chronic conditions of this kind, that erysipelas or erythema does to those of an acute form.' The cir- cumstances that occasion tliis disturbance of the'abdominal viscera are very various, and many of them were wont to be regarded as the immediate causes of cutixneous disease; but it will be found that they are not truly so, having always interposed, between their ope- ration and the affection of the skin, some derangement of the di- gestive functions, which ought more properly to be considered the cause of the disease. In the treatment it is often sufficient to re- store the general health, but more frequently it is necessary to con- join local means with those employed for this purpose, since, as has been already observed, the morbid action of the skin is apt to bc- 3

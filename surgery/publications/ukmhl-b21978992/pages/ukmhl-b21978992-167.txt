131 EXTERNAL INJURIES. CHAPTER IX. EXTERNAL IN.TURIES. Bndses. By a lirulse is understood an injiu-y caused by a blow, or by violent compression, without division of the integuments. Its ef- fects vary according to circumstances, but the most common one is Eccliymosis, or the injection of blood into the cellular tissue, which occasions more or less swelling, and discoloration of the skin. The blood after being thus effused is gi'adually removed by absorp- tion, during which the colour of the part passes through various shades of red, green, and yellow, that have been differently ex- plained, but not as yet satisfactorily. To promote tliis absorption, some gently stimulating lotion, containing the salts of ammonia, spirits, and vinegar, ought to be applied, together with moderate pressirre. It is usual to apply leeches in the treatment of ecchy- mosis, but it is clear that, the blood being not contained within its own vessels, and, on the contrary, extravasated into the cellular substance, bleeding from the surface cannot possibly be of any ser- vice, and may even do harm by increasing the weakness wliich the skin has previously suffered, both from the immediate effect of the injury, and also by its separation from the parts beneath which at- tends the bloody effusion, and thus causing sloughing. The blood is sometimes effused in larger quantity, and collected in a cavity fonned by the torn and distended cellular substance. In this kind of bruise there is usually the same sort of discolora- tion of the skin as in the former, but the size and fluctuation of the tumour readily distinguish it This condition is comj)rehended imder the title of ecchymosis; but it is necessary to make a dis- tinction between the two, though doubtless merely different degrees of the same injury, since the process of recovery is apt to be consi- derably different. It is always desirable to promote absorption, and for this purpose

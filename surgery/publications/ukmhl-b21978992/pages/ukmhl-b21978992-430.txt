The complaint is then usually associated with weakness of the inferior extremities, which betrays the nature of its origin, but it sometimes exists alone, and is of itself sufficient to render the patient miserable. Power- ful counter-irritation, especially that effected by the actual cautery applied on each side of the spinous processes of the lower lumbar vertebrae, affords the best chance of relief; and internal stimulants, as cantharides, may be conjoined with this practice, though there is seldom decided evidence of their exerting any beneficial influ- ence. Warm and cold bathing, frictions, and strict a tention to the preservation of general health, should at the same time be diligent- ly employed; and improvement must not be despaired of though it should be a long while of appearing. Incontinence is common in old age; but in this case is generally confined to the period of sleep, and may be prevented from proving troublesome by intro- â€˜ ducing the catheter previous to the time of rest In extreme cases of incontinence, when there is a constant dribbling from the ure- thra, the patient may be rendered comj)aratively comfortable by at- taching to the penis an elastic bag of India rubber, provided with a plug or stop-cock, for allowing the urine to escape when a conve- nient opportunity occurs. Irritahilitij or Chronic Inflammation of the Bladder. This complaint is almost confined to males. It is characterized by frequent desire to make water, and inability to resist these calls, however incessant or inconvenient.

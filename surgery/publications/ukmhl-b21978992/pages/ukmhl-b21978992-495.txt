SKIN. 449 dressing with pressure ought then to be used. When the tendons or bones are destroyed, amputation must be performed, as the fin- ger, even though it might be healed, could not be of any service to the patient Exfoliation of the distal phalanx, which frequently occurs, does not require the same proceeding, as the finger, though somewhat shortened by it, is not materially impaired either in ap- pearance or utility. The Palmar Fascia, on the ulnar side of the hand, is liable to contraction, attended with thickening, which produces more or less complete and permanent flexion of the little and ring-fingers. This affection occurs in young and middle-aged persons of both sexes, but in males more frequently than females. It seems to be induced by violent exertion and pressure of the hand. All kinds of external applications have been found quite unavailing in its treatment, and the only mode of affording relief is to cut across the contracted fibres, and then extend the finger on a splint. The division should be effected by subcutaneous incisionâ€”for which purpose a needle with a sharp cutting edge answers best. The small toes are liable to a similar affection, whicb is extremely in- cx)nvenient in walking. It might perhaps be remedied in the same manner, but as it may be removed at once by amputation without any serious loss to the patient, this mode of relief should be pre- ferred. F f

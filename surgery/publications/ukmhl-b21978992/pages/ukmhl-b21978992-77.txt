45 GRANULATION. more readily in parts which are lax, than in those which are compa- ratively fixed from adhering to the subjacent bones. The sore which remains after the removal of nearly the whole scrotum by sloughing or operation readily heals, with a very small cicatrix, while injimies of the scalp attended with loss of substance are repaired very slowly, and with a considerable depression at the part The old stories of regeneration following removal of the lip for cancer, and destruc- tion of the glans penis by sloughing, when inquired into and stript of their exaggerations, are found to admit of easy explanation. In the former case it is apt to appear that the disease occupies a larger extent of the part affected than it really does, from the morbid gi’owth taking the place of, and pressing aside the sound textures. Hence the whole lip may seem to be involved and taken away by operation, while, in fact, a comparatively small portion only has been removed, and the remainder is ready to stretch out when its surface is drawn together by the granulating action, and thus, in a great measure, supply the loss of substance. Sometliing of a similar description occurs in slougliingnf the tongue or glans penis, —the swelling which attends the preceding inflammation making the part concerned appear much larger that it really is, so that, though the destruction is only partial, it may he thought complete. On all occasions, when a sore heals by the gramdating process, there is great risk of supposing that the cavity is filling uj), w'hile, in truth, the bottom remmns at the same level, and appeal’s to rise from the surroimding skin descending towards it, just as the banks of a river seem to glide past the ohserv'er, who is carried smoothly on by the current The best evidence as to tliis is afforded by sores seated over bones or other fixed points, between which and the sur- face of the granulations, the distance is not found to increase. In the old way of performing amputation, by cutting all the parts of the limb nearly on the same level, a large granulating surface resulted, which, if successive layers of organized structme were really formed by it, should grow out into a bulbous shape. But, instead of this, it is well known that just the oppo- site condition obtains, and that the surrounding skin is drawn in a puck- ered form closely round the hone,— as may be seen from this view of a stump, wliich resulted from an am- putation performed, on account of

450 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. CHAPTER XXII. THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. Inflammation of the Conjunctiva. The conjunctival covering of the eye and eyelids is very liable to inflammation, in consequence of a great variety of irritations, both direct and indirect. Bright light, intense heat, cold wind, acrid fumes, dust, and foreign bodies of all kinds introduced under the eyelids, produce inflammatory symptoms more or less severe,' according to the irritability of the Individual, and the degree of irritation. The suppression of accustomed secretions through the operation of cold or any other cause, is also a fruitful source of such attacks. The proneness to this inflammation is remarkably increased by habit. In considering the symptoms of the disease, it is necessary to divide them into acute and chronic. The former are, 1. redness and turgcscence of the conjunctiva, the surface of which is every- where covered with arborescent vessels; 2. swelling of the eyelids, and watering of the eye: 3. intolerance of light; 4. pain of the eye- ball and forehead; 5. symptomatic fever. The characters of the chronic form are moderate redness without tumefaction, weakness of the eye when employed for vision, and a disagreeable sensation, as if from the presence of some granular body under the eyelids. Between these extremes there are innumerable shades of differ- ence in the severity of the symptoms, according to the peculiarities of particular cases. When the inflammation is very intense, the turgcscence of the conjunctiva is sometimes so great, as to cause an obvious swelling of the membrane, which is named Chemosis. It depends on effusion into the loose subjacent cellular texture, partially conceals the cornea, and may even evert the eyelids. The chronic condition almost always remains as a consequence of the acute one, and when it exists independently of this origin, gene- rally proceeds from some chronic source of irritation, either direct

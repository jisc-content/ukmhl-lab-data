The matter may be collected either on the external surface, or in the interior of the bone. In both cases there is more or less ex- cavation, effected by absorption of the bone concerned; and in the latter not only this effect ensues, but also an enlargement of the external shell of the bone, wliich thus forms an expansion, consti- tuting what is called spina ventosa. The most remarkable example of osseous expansion from the forma- tion of matter with wliich I am acquainted, is here represented from a preparation in the Museum of the College of Surgeons of Edin- burgh. It resulted from fracture of the tibia, and existed, progres- sively increasing, for many years, during which the patient was en- abled to discharge the duties of an active life, by closing the orifice with a cork, shown in the cut, which he removed from time to time when he found a convenient opportunity for pouring out the accu- mulated fluid. The cavities which are formed in the cancellated substance of bones, especially in those cases where there has been a previous infiltration of scrofulous formation, frequently contain loose portions of the spongy bone, which have been deprived of vitality by the inflammation. hen the matter escapes from a hollow of the bone by causing absorp-

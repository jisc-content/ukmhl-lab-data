PREFACE. The following work is intended to give a comprehen- sive and systematic view of the facts and opinions which constitute the science of modern Surgery. The progress of Medicine in recent times has greatly simplified the doc- trines of pathology and practice, by establishing general principles, to which the phenomena of particular diseased conditions, and the different methods pursued in their treatment, may be referred. I have endeavoured to col- lect these principles, and arrange them so as to facilitate their study and recollection. The edition now offered to the public has been carefuUy revised and corrected in every point where the improvements of others or my own re- flection and experience suggested alteration. I feel grate- ful for the kind reception which the work has hitherto met with, and trust that it will now be found more deserving of approbation. In regard to the illustrations, I have to express my obli- gations to my friend and pupil, Mr James Moore, who has kindly supplied the drawings ; and to Mr Leith of this city, for the aid he has afforded by his recently introduced pro- cess of engraving on stone, which seems well suited to the subjects of the plates. The woodcuts are by Mr Bastin of London. Edinburgh, February 1842.

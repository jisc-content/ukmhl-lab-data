266 nUN’ClPLES OF SUKGERY. CHAPTER XV. THROAT. Woicnds of the Throat. VVTien self-destruction is attempted by cutting tlie throat, the wound is generally inflicted transversely near the os hyoides, some- times above, but more frequently below it. There is usually an extensive division of the integuments, which are occasionally the only parts injured—and when the injury penetrates deeply, it al- most always extends into the phar}mx. Sometimes an opening is made into the larynx, and in a few rare cases the trachea is cut, either alone or together with the oesophagus. The great blood- vessels are very seldom injured, from the force of the incision be- ing spent in dividing the tough substance of the pharynx and air- passage, froni the part of the throat which is chosen for the pur- ])ose, and from the position in which it is held, while the knife is applied. When they are opened it is usually by a sharj)-pointed knife being thrust directly down upon them. In considering the treatment of cut-tlu*oat it is necessary to dis- tinguish between, 1. those cases in which an opening is made above the rima ylottidis; 2. those in which it is below the rima ylottidis, but does not extend to the oesophagus ; and 3. those in wliich the oesophagus is wounded. When the aj)erture, as usually happens, is above the orifice of the larynx, the dangers to be dreaded, in the first instance, are the entrance of blood into the trachea during respiration, owing to its accumulation in the pharynx, and the esciq)o of food through the wound during deglutition. To obviate the former of these, the cut edges should not be brought together until the bleeding from them has entirely or nearly ceased; and with the same view the i>a- tient should be made to lie on his face or side, so as to favour the exit of fluids from the wound. If the injury of the pharynx is not very extensive, it will hardly be requisite to employ any measures

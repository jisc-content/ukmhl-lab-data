33 STKICTURE OF THE URETHRA. nate forms, the symptoms of the disease are, in general, pecu- liarly distressing, the urine being not only expelled with great difficulty by drops, or the smallest of thread-like streams, but also very imperfectly retained, dribbling away involuntarily by day as well as night, and causing the utmost discomfort, by its effects on the patient’s clothes and skin, exposed to the acrid moisture. In 1844, I felt great pleasure in communicating to the pro- fession a mode of remedy, which had afforded complete and permanent relief in a case of obstinate stricture, than which it was impossible to imagine one more distressing, or more hope- less, under any other known means of treatment. In 1849, encouraged by farther experience, I published a treatise on the treatment of stricture, with the view of explaining and recom- mending this method, and since that time have related a great many additional cases illustrative of its effects. For more par- ticular details I may refer to these sources of information, it being sufficient at present to render the principles of practice distinctly intelligible. It is well known that there are certain textures, healthy as well as morbid, which cannot be expanded without pain and the risk of inflammation, but may bo divided by incision with ease and safety. Spasmodic stricture of the anus, and the ring at the base of the prostate, which cannot be torn without the production of fatal effects, afford examples of this kind, and illustrate the advantage of cutting, under certain circumstances, instead of dilatation. In strictures of the urethra which exhibit the irritable and unyielding or resilient characters, it therefore seems reasonable to expect advantage from dividing them freely by means of a cutting instimment, instead of persevering in vain and hazardous efforts to dilate the coirtracted part by bougies. Attempts to accomplish this, by introducing sheathed blades into the canal, and also by cutting from without upon the point of an instrument carried down to the seat of obstruction, had been frequently made with a different view, viz., overcoming resistance which was supposed to render tlie canal imperme- able, but with very unsatisfactory results, from imperfect attain- ment of the object, extraA’asation of urine, and haDmorrhage caused through the Avant of a safe guide for the knife. In the operation Avhich I proposed, the first and essential step Avas to introduce a grooved director fairly through the stricture, so

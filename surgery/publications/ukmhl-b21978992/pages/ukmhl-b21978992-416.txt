372 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. placed reclining, with his shoulders supported on a table, con- structed for the purpose, so as to admit of the patient’s body and pelvis being nicely adjusted in position. The bladder being mo- derately distended with urine, or water injected into it, a sound is passed to ascertain the precise position of the stone, the surgeon then introduces the apparatus, and expanding the branches when fairly in the bladder, seizes the calculus, and exercises the requi- site compression for breaking it The complexity of the instru- ments, and the circumstiinces in which they are used, render the process extremely difficult, while the bad consequences of its in- expert performance are of the most serious nature. It will pro- bably, therefore, never be practised with advantage, except by those who devote a large share of their attention to its perform- ance ; and even in such hands, there is reason to fear, that though perhaps in some cases successful, and seldom immediately fatal, it may not unfrequently be productive of the most mischievous ef- fects. Chronic inflammation of the prostate gland or mucous membrane, if excited by the pressure or laceration of the instru- ment, will probably lead to farther derangement of the urinary se- cretion, and the consequent deposition of new calculi,—the irrita- tion caused in extracting which, will keep up the train of morbid action, and if not at length fatal to the patient, must at all events make him suffer much more than he would have done from exci- sion of the stone. There is no operation of surgery which lias excited so much at- tention, and been practised in so many different ways, as Litho- tomy. A prejudice, that it was imsafe to cut the neck of the blad- der, for many centuries paralysed all exertions in improving the operation, which, in accordance with this misleading principle, was performed by making an incision in the perineum, and then nomi- nally dilating, but really tearing, the orifice of the bladder suffi- ciently to allow the stone to be extracted. Such a procedure be- ing tedious, painful, and dangerous, was justly dreaded both by patients and surgeons, the latter of whom willingly resigned it to irregular practitioners of rupture curing, and cutting for the stone, who in those days travelled the country in search of employment. The mode of performing lithotomy was indeed taught in the schools, and ingenious men contrived various modifications of the apparatus; but no real improvement was effected until near the end of the seventeenth centiu-y, when Frere Jacques introduced an entirely different method, which was to cut freely into the bladder. He commenced his career as a lithotomist, unacquainted with ana-

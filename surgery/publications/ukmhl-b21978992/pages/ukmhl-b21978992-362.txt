PIIINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 318 upon lymph being thrown out at and around the mouth of the sac. If this harrier be broken up, death will inevitably hapjKm, and there- fore the surgeon should either leave the contents of the hernia as he finds them, or limit his interference to laying the gut freely open if it is not so already, after which a soft poultice, or pledget of emollient ointment, may be placed on the part After tlie ope- ration, unless circumstances should require the wound to he kept open, its edges ought to be drawn together by stitches, and have a thick compress of folded lint supported by a bandage applied over them. When things go on well the patient experiences relief almost immediately after the operation. The tormenting pain of the um- bilical region, the sickness, and the vomiting subside, the warmth of the body becomes uniformly diffused, the anxious expression of the countenance disappears, and a full, soft, moderately frequent pulse gives further indication of the salutary change that has taken place. In the coiirse of an hour or two, one or more, usually se- veral, copious evacuations of the bowels, show not only that the gut has been relieved from mechanical obstruction, but that it has been restored to the due perfonnance of its functions. If this favourable event does not occur spontaneously within three or four hours, it ought to be gently solicited by giving a table-spoonful of castor oil, which may, if necessary, be followed by the injection of a mild enema. Tenderness of the abdomen, or uneasiness felt in it in- dependently of pressure, will suggest the immediate aj)plication of warm fomentations, and if it should increase, or he accompanied with acceleration of the pulse, heat of skin, thirst, anxiety, or rest- lessness, general bleeding, and leeching of the abdomen miist be resorted to without delay, decidedly and freely, so as if possible to subdue the incipient peritonitis. Opium and calomel ought then to be administered in doses proportioned to the urgency of the cir- cumstances, and tobacco injections, as well as the solution of tar- trate of antimony, aiâ€™e very useful in relieving pain and allaying any tendency to overaction that may remain after the force of the inflammation has been broken. In consequence, probably, of the pressure which has been sustained by the gut while strangulated, and which there is reason to believe generally occasions a certain degree of constriction in the canal for a considerable length of time subsequent to reduction, the patient is frequently annoyed for days or weeks with occasional sym])toms of chronic inflammation, for which gentle aperients, administered by the mouth and rectum,

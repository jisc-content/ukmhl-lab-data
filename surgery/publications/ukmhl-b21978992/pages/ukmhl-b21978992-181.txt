AMPUTATION. 145 CHAPTER X. AMPUTATION. The expression Amputation, though sometimes applied to the excision of parts from the trunk, is generally confined in its mean- ing to the removal of limbs by the knife. In performing this ope- ration, it is not sufficient merely to cut away what is diseased or in- jiu-ed, since the surface that remains ought to be left in such a state as will favom- the healing of the wound, and afibrd a comfortable stump to the patient Many different modes of operating have been contrived, with the view of attaining these objects; and there is no department of practical surgery into which more improvements have been introduced in recent times. Amputation was anciently performed by the direct and simple process of cutting down at once to the bone, and sawing it thi'ough on a level with the soft parts. But it being found that in this way there was no covering provided for the bone, whence followed a tedious and imperfect cure, various modifications were introduced to supply the defect. The muscles were drawn up by metallic plates, or split clotlis, and pieces of leather, called retractors. Ches- elden, (1720,) drew back the skin after it was cut, and then di- vided the muscular parts higher up. This method of double inci- sion was carried to an extreme by Mr Mynors of Birmingham, who dissected the skin, and tinned it back like the sleeve of a coat. Louis cut the muscles by two circular incisions, so as to divide the portion nearest the bone higher up than the external layer. Alan- son, by holding his knife obliquely, while he made the circular sweep through the muscles, cut them at once in the same form that residted from two successive incisions. The object of all these contrivances was to leave the soft parts 5 sufficiently long to cover the bone; but this they failed in accom- iplishing, excepting so far as concerned the skin; for the muscles (being in the first instance cut higher than the integuments, and K I

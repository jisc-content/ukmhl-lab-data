PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, 360 dining forwards, to promote the discharge of vu'ine; and great care must be taken that the tube does not become obstructed by mucus, or in any otlier way. When the cellular substance sur- rounding the wound has become consolidated by adhesive effusion, as happens in a day or two, a plug may be fitted into the orifice of the cannula, and withdrawn from time to time; but it generally hapjiens that the old passage is soon restored, after the bladder has been freed from the irritation of its accumulated contents. The bladder may be punctured from the perineum by making a deep incision, a little to one side of a line extending from the bulb to the anus, and then pushing a long curved trocar inwards in the direction of the neck of the bladder, so as to open it nearly in the same situation as when operating in the former way. There is thus a more dependent opening provided for the escape of the urine; but the ojieration is severe, difficult, and very dangerous in the hands of a surgeon not perfectly familial’ wath the relative situation of the parts concerned. Puncturing from the rectum may have been suggested by the opening whicli is sometimes formed naturally between it and the bladder, or prostatic portion of the urethra. In cases of complete retention, where the parts lu-e not altered by disease, there can cer- tainly be no easier or more satisfactory mode”’of relieving the pa- tient by operation. The bladder behind the prostate, for the ex- tent of an inch or more, is not covered with peritoneum; and the vesicuIcE sem/nales, though they meet together at the gland, diverge from each other in proceeding backwards, so as to leave sufficient space for the })uncture. The vasa deferentia lie near the centre, and may perhaps be injured, even though the trocar is introduced exactly in the mesial j)lane; but any inconvenience that miglit be expected to result from this source ought not to be regarded as a serious objection to a proceeding which affords the only means of averting nearly certain death, especially as experience does hot confirm the a])]irehcnsion. When the o])eration is ])erformcd, the patient should be laid on his back at the edge of the bed, with his knees bent and thighs held up, so as to present the parts fairly to the surgeon, who, having anointed the fore and middle fingers of his left hand, introduces them gently into the rectum until he feels the posterior confines of the prostate. The trocar, which should be six inches long and curved, is then carried in along the channel formed by the fingers, and when its ])oint has passed beyond the prostate, the handle is depressed, so as to puncture the coats of the

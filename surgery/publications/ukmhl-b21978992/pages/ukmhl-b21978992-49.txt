1 la.-- INFLAMMATION. 17 more rarely the veins of tlie hand and foot, are chosen for vene- section. Venesection.—The patient should be placed in a reclining pos- ture, unless the peculiar circumstances of his case should render some other more convenient; a bandage is then to be put twice round the arm, about an inch above where it is proposed to open the vessel, and tied with sufficient force to obstruct the veins with- out impeding the current of the artery. The surgeon now chooses the largest vein, which is generally the median basilic—puts the limb into such a position as may be preserved while the blood is flowing, and presses the thumb of one hand upon the vessel im- mediately below where he proposes to puncture it, in order to pre- vent it from rolling, and the blood from escaping imtil he is ready to receive it; then holding the lancet with the other hand, he in- troduces it into the vein at an angle of 45, in respect both to the surface of the skin and longitucbnal direction of the vessel. When the blood appears, he ceases to push the instrument deeper, but carries it a little farther forward, in order to enlarge the opening of the vein; and lastly, elevates the point, so as to make the ex- ternal wound of sufficient size, which varies from a quarter to three- eighths of an inch, according to the tliickness of the subcutaneous fat The pressiue of the thumb is then removed, and the blood is allowed to flow as long as seems proper. The surgeon, when a sufficient quantity has been abstracted, slackens the bandage,— places his thumb upon the orifice,—cleanses the arm from blood, —lays a snudl compress of folded lint on the wound,—and applies ' with moderate firmness a single turn of a bandage in the figure of 8. It frequently happens, from the operator making too small a wound, or the opening of the vein ceasing to correspond with that of the skin, that the blood enters the cellular substance, and con- stitutes a tumour, which is named Thrombus, It produces no in- convenience, farther than arresting the flow of blood; and if from tliis, or any other cause, the quantity desired cannot be obtained, I it is better to open another vein, than to. run the risk of exciting inflammation in the one already wounded, by introducing probes, ! or using any other contrivances for assisting the blood to escape. I When the patient is fat, or the vessel small, the simgeon not being i able to see the veins, must feel for them; and then the one already ‘ mentioned, the median basilic, is generally recognized most easily, both from its large size and regidar situation, on the inner side of : the tendinous attachment of the biceps to the fascia of the forc- n

To this operation the same objections have been urged as to that for carcinoma, and the same considerations ought to guide the surgeon in deciding on the propriety of its performance. If the whole of the diseased parts cannot be taken away, no operation ought to be attempted. If the operation be performed when the morbid process has made a ra- pid advance—^the patient’s appearance is unhealthy—the confines of the tumour are indistinctly circumscribed—or when ulceration has taken place, the prognosis will be very unfavourable. If the tumour is of firm consistence,—distinctly limited—not adherent— of slow formation—and the patient has a tolerably healthy appear- ance, the prospect of a diu’able recovery will be better. The appearances found on dissection also afford important indications in regard to the result. The more soft and bloody the consist- ence of the tumour is, the more malignant may be regarded the morbid disposition, and the more firm it is, the more fibrous inter- secting bands it contains, the more in short, it approaches the na- ture of fibrous sarcoma, the less fear may be entertained of a re- lapse.

GENITAL ORGANS. 387 CHAPTER XIX. DISEASES OF THE GENITAL ORGANS. Gonorrhoea. By Gonorrhoea is understood an inflammatory affection of the urctlira, attended with a discharge of thick yellow fluid. As the inflammatory symptoms subside, the discharge becomes thinner, paler, and at last almost watery, when it constitutes what is called a Gleet This disease is certainly the result of impure inter- course ; but, whether it requires for its production that the person infecting should have been infected, in other words, whether it is to be ascribed to the influence of a peculiar poison transmitted from one person to another, or whether it may arise merely from excessive and promiscuous intercourse, and then excite similar af- fections in others, is not yet fully ascertained. There is great variety in the susceptibility of (fifferent individuals, and the matter seems active in proportion to its thickness and yellowness. The watery discharge of a gleet, in persons of ordinary sensibility to ir- ritation, is innocuous, but in others it may occasion the most vio- lent gonorrhma. The first symptoms of the disease generally appear from one to four days after the poison has been applied. They eonsist in itch- ing, redness, and swelling of the orifice of the imethra, and are soon succeeded by a painful burning sensation in the same jiart, particularly severe during micturition, the calls to which are much more frequent than usual. A thin serous exudation then takes ]dace, at first merely gluing together the edges of the orifice, but (|uickly becoming more copious, and at the same time acquiring a purulent appearance. While these local changes are occurring, the system sufiers general derangement in proportion to its irrihibility, and the acuteness of the inflammation. Tliis symptomatic fever is often attended with local disturbance of different parts. The ab- sorbent vessels of tlie penis, the glands of the groin, and the testi-

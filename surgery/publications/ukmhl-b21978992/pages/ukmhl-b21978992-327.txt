283 THORAX. positive proof on the subject, it is prudent in doubtful cases to open the wound in order to ascertain the truth. Many elaborate directions are given by the old writers for the suppression of hemorrhage from the wound of an intercostal artery, —an injury very seldom met with. If the opening were freely di- lated, a compress of lint applied under the edge of the rib, would probably ])rove sufficient, and if it should not, there could be no harm in rendering its effect more certain by including it in a ligature drawn round the rib under the edge of which the vessel lies. In consequence of wounds and fractures of the thorax, air is fre- quently injected into the cellular substance under the integuments of the chest, constituting what is called Emphysema, and in other cases it is accumulated within the pleura so as to distend the mem- brane, and compress the sound lung with distressing or even fatal effect It is higldy importint to be acquainted with the circum- stances on which these events depend, and the mode of preventing or remedying them. For the production of emphysema, it is requisite that there should be an aperture in the pleura costalis, to admit the air into the cel- lular substance; and the power which forces it to enter is always the eonfraction of the parietes of the thorax,—but there are two sources from which the air thus impelled may be derived. One of these is a simple penetrating wound of the thoracic parietes, so narrow, or so shaped and situated, as to allow the air to enter the chest during inspiration, but oppose its free exit during expiration, pennitting it to pass no further than through the pleura. The se- cond is a wound of the lungs and pleura costalis^ existing without any outlet through the parietes of the chest, which may be caused by the spicular extremity of a fractured rib, or may result from the healing of the skin, while the breach in the lung and pleura re- mains open, in a case where both the parietes and lung have been wounded. When the air enters the cellular substance, it diffuses itself more or loss extensively, and occasions a flat undefined swel- ling of the integuments, which is recognized by a crepitating or crackling sensation, that is felt on pressing it, and by the quick dis- appearance of dimples thus occasioned in its surface. The integu- ments of the whole body, except where the subjacent connections of the skin are very firm, as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, may be distended in this way,—but universal emphysema is an extremely rare occurrence,—its extent being usually liTnited to the

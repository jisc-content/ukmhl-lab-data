65 DISEASED NUTRITION. CHAPTER VII. DISEASED NUTRITION. Tumours. By Diseased Nutrition is understood an action of the capillary vessels, which, instead of preserving the tissue concerned in a na- tural condition, increases its size or alters its texture. The mor- bid growths thus resulting constitute the principal division of a most important class of stmgical diseases, which are named Tumours. The term tumour implies enlargement of a part of the body be- yond its natimal dimensions, wliich may be owing to the effusion or accumulation of fluids, as in hydrocele, the displacement of organs, as in hernia, or morbid growths, as in wens. Morbid growths include simple enlargements of the natural tis- sues, such as exostosis,—conversion of them into textures foreign to the healthy constitution of the body, such as cancer of the breast,— j. and the development of entirely new formations, such as fibrous ji tumoms. Mr Abemethy used the term tumour as synonymous ’ with morbid growth, and restricted its application “ to such swel- 1 lings as arise fi-om some new production, which made no pai’t of 1 the original composition of the body.”* As this would exclude 1 many important enlargements of natural tissues which constitute f tumours very deserving of attention, the more comprehensive de- {finition that has just been stated seems to be preferable. Morbid growths occur in almost every part of the body, but the j glands and subcutaneous tissue are their most frequent seats. They «are very variable in the rapidity and extent of their increase, but, f generally speaking, grow quickly in proportion to their size ; and mother things being equal, usually enlarge most vigorously when ‘ their situation is dependent Any thing that irritates, or tends to ! inflame them, promotes their increase; and opposite circumstances are attended with opposite effects; rest, low diet, cold application^ pand leeches, lessen the activity of their enlargement. * Abernethy on Tiimouni, p. 6.

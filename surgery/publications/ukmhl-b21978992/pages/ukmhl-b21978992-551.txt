EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. 503 PLATE IX. Fig. 1. Solid exostosis, removed from the thigh-bone a little above the inner condyle. Fig. 2. Hollow exostosis of the lower jaw depending upon the formation of a fibrous tumour in its cancellated texture. The expansion extends into the coronoid process, which is in consequence thickened and ele- vated. PLATE X. Fig. 1. Foliated or needle-shaped exostosis of the lower jaw, depending upon the growth of a fibrous tumour. (See woodcut, page 489). Fig. 2. A very large fibrous tumour of the lower jaw remaining in connec- tion with the bone, which, if macerated, would have presented an ap- pearance similar to that represented above. PLATE XL Fig. 1. A very large fibro-cartilaginous tumour of the hiunerus which was removed with success. It weighed twelve pounds, and embraced the neck of the scapula so as to be quite fixed to the side. The coracoid and acromion processes were taken away along with it, not from being diseased, but to facilitate the operation. Fig. 2. Cartilaginous tumours not unlrequently met with in the digital pha- langes and metacarpal bones. PLATE XII. Figs. 1 and 2. Superficial bursae lying over the joints of the fingers and toes, and accounting for troublesome symptoms frequently presented by these parts. PLATE XIII. Fig. 1. Lateral section of the pelvis, showing the relative situation of the parts concerned in lithotomy. Fig. 2. An internal view of the same parts. PLATE XIV. Fig. 1. Tumour of the forehead for which removal was recommended. Figs. 2 and 3. Bones connected with this growth after being macerated, showing how far the disease extended beyond reach of the knife, es- pecially towards the interior of the cranium, where it occupied nearly all the space appropriated to the anterior lobes of the brain.

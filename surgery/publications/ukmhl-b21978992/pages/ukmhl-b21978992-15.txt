February 1842. Dear Liston, 9, Charlotte Square, Though dedications are not much in fashion, I cannot refrain from htscribing this book to you, —not mdy as an expression of respect and regard for yourself professionally and personally,—but as a tribute justly due to the influence of your instruction and example at an early period of our acquaintance. Yours ever. Robert Liston, Esq. JAMES SYME.

41 EFFUSION. bandages being applied—and no change made in the dressing till the fourth day. The consequences were, that the blood and serum being confined, the edges of tlie wound were separated from each other; and the stimulus of necessity, as John Hunter called it, or irritation produced by the continuance of a breach in the structure of the body, which, if primary union had occurred, would have ceas- ed to exist, caused inflammation as the first step to the other mode of reparation already mentioned. Two insuperable obstacles, either of wliich would have been sufficient for the purpose, were thus pla- ced in the way of direct adhesion, viz. separation of the raw surfaces, and inflammatory action; and when the woimd was at length un- dressed, instead of beuig united, it was found distended into a cavi- ty filled with matter. It is much more consonant with reason, and will be found much more successful in practice, to close the lips of the wound only piirtially, or not at all, for ten or twelve hoims, until the bloody and serous oozing shall have ceased, and then to place them in the most exact possible contact, at the same time taking care to pre- vent or allay excited action by cold applications and suitable regi- men.* If the wound is so situated that its edges can be kept in contact merely by the firm application of dry lint, wliich does not oppose the sanguineous or serous discharge, it may at once be dres- sed in this way without any inconvenience, and with the advantage of saving future trouble. • In the year 1825 I published an Essay in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, recommending this mode of treating wounds, and I am happy to observe that it has gradually come into use, even with those who at first most strenuously opposed it.

The osseous tissue resembles in general the other vascular par s of the system as to the healthy and morbid actions of its nutritious system ; but is remarkably distinguished by its power of reproduc- tion. It is not possible to explain on what this difference depends ; but its existence is of great consequence in remedying the acci- dents to which bones are most exposed by their rigidity, viz. Frac- ture. Bones may be fractured in three ways. 1. By external violence operating directly upon the injured part 2. By external violence causing a strain upon the bone so as to break it, not where the force is applied, but at some other part of its extent 3. By inor- dinate action of the muscles. Fractimes result most frequently from the first and second of these causes, and very rarely from the third. They occur at all periods of life, but are more frequently met with in particulai* bones at one age than another. In children, the fe- mur, humerus, and clavicle; in adults, the bones of the leg and fore-arm, the shaft of the femur, the humerus, clavicle, and ribs ; and in old people, the neck of the femur, are the bones most liable to be broken. Independently of diseased conditions to be mention- ed afterwards, which render the bones more subject to fracture, it would appear that the bones of some individuals are more easily broken than those of others. Fractimes may be transverse or oblique in respect to the axis of the bone—they may exist at one part of it, or in several, whence they are distinguished into single and comminuted—and they may be attended with a wound expos- ing the bone, or without one, whence they are divided into Com- pound and Simple. In explaining the symptoms and treatment of fracture it is necessary to consider separately the two depart- ments of tills last division, wliich is of great importance.

BOXES. 173 sions, is very apt to c<ause mortification in the old people who ai*e sub- ject to the accident Should any indication of tliis disagreeable ef- fect appear, the limb ought to be immediately freed from all restraint, and simply laid over a large pillow or folded bolster, which wil tend to prevent displacement of the fractured surfaces. A fibrous connection will then be gradually formed, with more or less short- ening of the thigh, and as strength returns, the patient should, by cold affusion, and gentle exercise, endea- vour to regain the use of the limb. In process of time he becomes able to walk with the assistance of a staff and high-heeled shoe. In fracture through the trochanters osseous re- union is certainly and readily accom- plished, provided the limb be kept steady in a proper position; and, judging from my own experience, I should say, that the long splint may always be safely employetl for this purpose, since it is not necessary to effect any extension, but merely to prevent motion of the limb. Of the bones of the fore-arm the radius is most liable to be fractured, and generally gives way about an inch above the wrist The accident is usually occasioned by falls on the palm of the hand. It is re- cognized by the ordinary characters of fracture, and is often ren- dered very obvious by the hand being bent inwards, owdng to the pronator radii quadratun drawing the broken extremities of the bone towards the ulna; or by the distal end of the radius being driven frickwards so as to make the proximal one project under the integuments of the WTist When there is little distortion the treat- ment requires merely the prevention of motion; and this is easily effected by applying a couple of pasteboard splints and a bandage, which may be a simple roller, as it can be readily changed without deranging the fracture. When the hand is inverted, some coun- teracting power must be employed, and the most effectual method of obtaining it, is to apply a cushion and splint of wood or iron in the s<ime way as for fractured fibiila. The splint ought to be chan-

176 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY, tion of the bone towards the side, while the sujiraspinatus and other muscles Inserted into the tuberosities cause the uj>per fi-agraent to project forwards and rather outwards. This accident happens from falls on the shoulder, and is easily recognized by placing one hand in the axilla, while the other subjects the humerus to rotation and abduction. The treatment requires a thick compress in the axilla to counteract the effect of the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, with a spica bandage to restrain the upper extremity of the bone from being everted, and a sling to support the bmb. The clavicle is frequently fractured, by external violence acting directly, and also when transmitted through more or less extent of the superior extremity. The pain, swelling, mobility, and crepitus of the broken part, which is usually about the beginning of the acromial curvature, readily betray the injury, which is rendered still more obvious, by the sternal extremity of the bone being drawn iq) by the sterno-mastoid muscle, and the shoulder being depressed, brought nearer the sternum, and rendered more prominent forwards by the action of the pectoralis major and latissijnus dorsi, assisted by the weight of the limb. In children the displacement is much less observable than in adults, owing to the lightness of their arms, and hence the injury in them is frequently not discovered until the swelling which attends reunion attracts attention. Great difficulty has been experienced in treating this fracture ; and Desaultâ€™s method, though complicated and troublesome, has been regarded the best for the puqoose. It consists of a thick cu- shion fixed in the axilla, to serve as a fulcrum for removing the shoulder outwards to its proper position, by means of the humerus when brought close to the side; a bandage to keep this cushion steady, another to fiisten the ann, and a third to elevate the shoul- der, by drawing up the affected elbow. When the cushion in the axilla is secured so high and so firmly as rcolly to serve the office of a fulcrum, it compresses the nerves and blood-vessels beyond en- durance ; and if it be allowed to descend so as not to do this, it in- creases the distortion, by separating the arm from the side. The method which, on the whole, appears to be the most simple and ef- ficient, is to brace back the shoulders by a figure of 8 bandage, or shoulder straps drawn together by any simple contrivance; and having thus obviated the distortion, except so far as regards the de- pression caused by the weight of the limb, to remedy this also, by placing the affected arm obli(iuely across the chest, with the fingers pointing to the opposite acromion, and securing it in this position

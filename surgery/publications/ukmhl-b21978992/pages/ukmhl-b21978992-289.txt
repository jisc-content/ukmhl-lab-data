247 MUSCLES. CHAPTER XIII. MUSCLES. Injuries of Muscles. The muscular tissue is not by any means prone to diseased ac- tion, and in general sufters little irritation from the injuries to which it is subjected. irounds.—Au incision in the long direction of a muscle occa- jsions very little inconvefaience, and the wound heals without any rremarkable difference from one confined to the integiunents. But iif the muscular fibres are divided transversely, their contractility I'causes a separation of the sides of the wound, more or less considcr- '.able, according to circumstances. No new muscular substance is ! ever formed to supply the defect, and it consequently remains per- (;mancnt, the intennediate space being occupied by a dense fibrous substance. The muscle concerned is for a time rendered weak in iaction, owing to the relaxation of its fibres; but in general it gra- dually becomes accommodated to the change, and acts with its for- mer vigour. Ill order to prevent this separation of the cut extremities as much os possible, the patient should be made to assume such a position as will most effectually relax the injured muscles. Sutures would 'have little effect in counteracting the retractile tendency, and it is j aot thought right to employ them lest they should excite irritation. I’unctured wounds of muscles are frequently followed by diffused : uflammation and extensive suppuration ; but these effects are to be I iscribed to the form of the wound, and the thick fascia which it gc- I lerally penetrates before reaching the muscle. In gunshot wounds, ind extensive laceration of the muscular texture, a troublesome de- i jree of swelling is apt to proceed from expansion of the soft or vas- •idar substance concerned, and requires the pressure of carefully Applied bandages.

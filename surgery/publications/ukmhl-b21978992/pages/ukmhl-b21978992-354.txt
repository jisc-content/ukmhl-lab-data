PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 310 wliich occasion Incarceration, are, 1. thickening and liardenino- of the oineutuin, which comes to resemble the pancreas or even denser structures; 2. adhesions between the viscera and sac ; 3. distension of the gut with intestinal matters ; and 4. the peculiar condition of the caput ccecum, which cannot return, except slowly, in the same way it descended, by gradual extension of its cellular connections. The presence of a colourless elastic tumour, of unequal consistence, in the region of the inguinal canal, together with the history of the case, distinguishes the disease. Strangulation depends upon the pressure which is caused by the tough fibrous margin of the ingui- nal apertures or the condensed neck of the sac. The viscera may begin to suffer from the constriction immediately after their protrusion, or may not do so until long afterwards, on the occa- sion of another portion being suddenly forced down into the sac, or from the intestine becoming gorged with its contents. The symptoms of strangulation are a twisting burning pain referred to the umbilical region, constipation, sickness, and vomiting. The patientâ€™s countenfince is collapsed, pale, and anxious. Ilis pulse is small and feeble, his extremities are cold, and he can- not rest. The constipation docs not depend altogether, as might ' be supposed, on mechanical obstruction of the bowels, since it is observed where the omentum alone is contained in the hernia, and docs not always prove obstinate where the intestine is con- cerned. It seems to be owing chiefly to the perverted .action of the gut consequent on the pressure which it suffers. At first

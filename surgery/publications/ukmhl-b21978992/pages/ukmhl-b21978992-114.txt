PRlNCiri-ES OF SUKGEIIY, 82 with in both sexes at the time of life when youth is passing into ma- turity, anti also, though more seldom, at both earlier and later pe- riods. It generally occurs on the trunk, and especially on the dor- sal region. The structure is usually white and somewhat fibrous looking, but sometimes can hardly be distinguished from the adi- ])ose formation, from which, indeed, it has been found to differ only in having a slight admixture of cellular substance, rendering it more white and firm. There is at first no pain or other unpleasant symp- toms, and the patient usually retains good general health. The ope- ration for removal, in these circumstances, is readily undertaken, and executed without any difficulty or immediate bad consequence. But very soon iifter the wound is hciiled another growth, or more frequently several of the same kind appear in the neighbonr- hood; and if these be removed they arc speedily succeeded by new productions, of winch the consistence is harder or softer, the en- largement more rapid, and the distinction from neighbouring parts less complete. They also become painful and inclined to ulcerate and fnngate, and finally prove fabil to the patient. In the case here represented, there were two tumours, one lying in the groin, the other enveloping the left testicle, and extending into the perineum. Ire- moved them both, and, from the perfect cha- racters of the adipose growth which they pre- sented, augured favour- ably of the result, not- withstanding their de- viation from what is usually (jbserved in re- gard to tumours of this kind as to situation and form. The wound healed very s])eedily, but the patient returned at the end of two years with^oMr tumours occupying the same region, but possessing a larger size, as well as firmer consistence, and more intimate con- nection with the neighbouring parts. I then recognized the na- ture of the disease, and declined any farther interference. It

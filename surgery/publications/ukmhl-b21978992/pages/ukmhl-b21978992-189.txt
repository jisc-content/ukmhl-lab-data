153 AMPUTATION. After all, these operations, the arteries which are found to require ligatures must he tied; and the pressure of lint compresses, sup- ported hy proper bandages, will generally supersede with advantage both stitches and plasters. The toes ought to he amputated on tlie same principles; but, with the exception of the great one, which may be removed through the joint of the first and second phalanx, it is always proper in rcr moving them to perform disarticulation between the first phalanx and metatarsal bone, since the small portion that might be allowed to remain could be of no use, and in all probability would occasion lameness. When more of the great toe than the distal phalanx re- quires removal, the operation should be performed through the me- tatarsal bone, in order to prevent its large articulating extremity from impeding recovery, and rendering the foot imseemly as well as inconvenient. The incisions should be made as is here repre> sented. The flaps being then separated from the bone, it is divided by the pliers. If necessary, disarticulation of the metatarsal bone may be easily effected by prolonging the incision upwards to its joint with the tarsus. The disease requiring amputation sometimes extends to the tar- sus, but IS limited to the bones on one side of the foot, namely, the internal cuneiform and navicular on the tibial, and the cuboid on the fibular side. In this case, instead of amputating the leg, it is better to make a free removal of the diseased parts by taking them away to- gether with the metatarsal bones articulated to them. The opera- tions should be conducted on the same plan as for the removal of a metatarsal bone by itself, and will be found hardly more difllcult or serious. Partial amputation of the foot may also he performed transversely through the metatarsus, between the metatarsus and

PREFACE. The circumstance of ton years liaving elapsed since the last edition of my “ Principles of SuiiaERv” was published, may at first sight seem to render it unfit for students of the present day ; but when more carefully considered, will, I trust, lead to a different conclusion. This book was written at the request, and for the use of my pupils, when I taught systematic surgery. It never professed, or was intended to set forth all the opinions which were, had been, or might bo entertained in regard to each point of surgical practice, hut was limited to the statement of what I wished to explain and impress upon the gentlemen who attended my lectures. As the value of such a work must essentially depend upon the opportunities which its author has had for maturing his opinions and subjecting them to trial, I feel no shame in adverting to the fact, that the edition of this book, which is still in the hands of the reader, has, during the last ten years, been daily tried by the results of my practice in the clinical wards of the Iloyal Infirmary. Fourteen years’ pre- vious hospital experience had corrected the views which it gave in many respects, as will appear, if the first and subsequent editions are compared ; and the Supplement now added, con- tains all that is requisite to explain the changes in ray senti- ments which have taken place within the more recent jieriod. In order to shew how necessary such a digest of practical principles is for the advantageous prosecution of a clinical course, I have prefixed an introductory lecture, explanatory of the objects and method I pursue in teaching.

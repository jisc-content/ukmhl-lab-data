It was here that the old operation proved most difficidt and appalling; and when wc consider the deep situation of the artery, the diseased condition of its coats, and their close connection to the bone through means of the tendinous sheath of the triceps; also the large %' and shapeless cavity, at the bottom of which the . ^ vessel w'as to be secured; the hardly repres- sible hemorrhage; and the obstacle occasioned by the vein and nerve lying over the tumoiir, it does not seem surprising that its re- sults should have been almost uniformly fatal. Dr Wilmer of Co- ventry states, that at the time he wTote (1780,) there was not an instance of its successful performance in this country.* The mo- dern operation could hardly have been more practicable for aneu- rism in this situation, if it had not been for the haj)py improvement of John JIuntcr, (1785,) who, observing that no large branch rose from the artery for a long way above the tumour, proposed to tie it on the fore part of the thigh, where it was nearer the surface, and at a greater distance from the disease ; where the operation wonld be e<Jsier, and the coats of the vessel might be expected to remain in a more healthy state. Tlie artery may be tied either before or after it passes under the Sartorim muscle, but more conveniently at the former of these points, being there nearer the surface, and farther from the disease. The jratient being placed in a reclining posture, with liis knee bent and the thigh placed on its outer side, the surgeon should feel with the lingers of Ids left hand for the triangular hollow which is fonned by the meeting of the Su)‘toHus and adductor lougus, and, if necessary, to injike this more distinct, desire the patient to bend his * Wilmer’s Cases in Surgery.

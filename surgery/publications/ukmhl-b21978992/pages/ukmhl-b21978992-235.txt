197 BONES. ficial inspection it appears rough and porous. The pores are apertures for the transmission of blood-vessels, but their form is ! circular and their edges rounded off, so that sharp edges cannot {anywhere be perceived. The newly effused bone may thus be rea- dily distinguished from the diseased part, to the irritation of which 1: it owes its origin. It is necessary also to distinguish between ca- iries, and the excavation of the cancellated texture which is caused Iby absorption owing to pressure. In this case the bone presents â–  the same appearance that it would do if its external crust were re- ; moved by mechanical means ; and it possesses none of the white- i- ness, brittleness, or spicular surface observed in caries. As this c difference can hardly be ascertained until after maceration, a more \ useful distinction is afforded by the history of the case, and when- ' ever the excavation is plainly referable to pressure, no apprehen- 5 sion need be entertained of caries. It is thought by many, that I deep-seated collections of matter, if not evacuated early, may oc- (casion caries; but when this morbid state of the bone is connected j 'with deep suppuration, it will always be found to have been the di-

84 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. CHAPTER VIII. HLOOD-VESSELS. Arteries. The two great arterial trunks, the aorta and piilmonary artery, jigree generally in structure and function, but differ remarkably in two respects. The branches of the former unite or anastomose freely wdth their neighbours, while those of the latter continue un- connected from their origin to their termination; and the coats of the aorta are prone to morbid action, while those of the pulmo- nary artery are hardly knowm ever to suffer from it It is the aorta alone which affords subject for surgical practice. The arterial tube is composed of three coats; 1. The exter- nal or celhdar; 2. The middle or fibrous; and ,3. The internal or serous. The first of these consists merely of condensed cellu- lar membrane, and is therefore not recognized by some as a dis- tinct tissue, being regarded rather as a modification of the cellular sheath which envelopes otlier organs of the body. But the larger arteries and veins, where lying contiguous, have usually a cover- ing of this kind in addition to the one in question, which, from its compactness, strength, and constant existence, ought certainly to be considered an essential constituent part of the vessel. The middle coat is composed of circular fibres, which, from their ap- pejirancc and ])roperties, may with most pro])riety be referred to the clastic tissue. AVheu examined in a large artery of the hu- man body, or in the artery of a large animal, as the horse, they arc distinctly extensible and resilient, so as to resemble the ligamen- turn nuchae of quadrupeds, and other similar structures. The elastic jjroperty of this coat must tend to preserve the vessel of a certain size, in opposition to the distending force of the blood, and the effect of any vital contractile power resident in the arterial tissue. 'That the arteries do possess such a power, cannot lie de- nied, since during life, and even for some time after death, at

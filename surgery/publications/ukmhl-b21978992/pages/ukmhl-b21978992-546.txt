498 PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. CHAPTER XXV. THE EAR. Foreign Bodies in the Ear. Children are very apt to introduce peas and other small bodies into the ear, and attempts to remove them with forceps of the usual construction tend to press them inwards. The forceps delineated at Fig. 2, Plate IV. or a slightly curved steel probe, is the most conve- nient instrument for the purpose. It has happened that the ex- traneous substance, by swelling after its introduction, or by being very forcibly inserted, resisted the most careful efforts at removal in this way, and it has become necessary to make an incision into the tube of the ear at its posterior side, so as to jiermit the intro- duction of a hook or probe for effecting the dislodgcment. Such a proceeding can be very rarely necessary, and the surgeon should beware of having recourse to it in cases where he cannot detect the foreign body by external examination, and is led to believe in its presence merely by the relation of the patientâ€™s fHends, as an erroneous imjircssion of this kind is frequently produced by dis- agreeable feelings in the ear, remaining after the removal of some irritating substance. The ceruminous secretion of the ear frequently accumulates in undue quantity, and occasions deafness more pr less complete. When this is discovered by inspection of the cavity in a bright light, a little oil should be introduced to soften the mass, after wdiich repeated injections of warm water are to be thrown in to wash out the wax. The patient should afterwards avoid exposure to cold, and take measures to prevent the same thing from hap- pening again. A preternaturally dry state of the meatus and membrane of the tympanum, depending upon a deficient secretion of wax, also im- pairs the sense of hearing, and benefit in such circumstances is of- ten derived from anointing the surface with some stimulating oint- 3

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 98 tents coagulate, and are absorbed with, or witliout, obliteration of the vessel; as in the remark- able case here represented from a preparation in the University Museum, where an aneurism of the aorta had xmdergone a spontaneous cure, and of which Dr Mon- ro has given a particular ac- count in his observations on aneurism of the abdominal aorta;* 2. The artery becomes obstructed from coagulation, or the effusion of lymph, and ulcerative absorption of the parietes of the tumour al- lows its contents to escape; 3. The sac opens by ulcera- tion or sloughing, without previous obstruction of the vessel. The consequence of the tw^o first of these tenni- nations is a natural cime, that of the third a fatal hemor- rhage. The treatment of aneurism consists in the use of means which tend to promote one or other of the two salutary pro- cesses just mentioned. The earliest attempts of this kind were di- rected with a view to the second of them, and their rudeness was equalled by their severity. The sac having been opened by cutting or burning, its contents were turned out, and then the hemorrhage was restrained by repeated applications of the actual caiitery, or some other powerful styptic. The introduction of the ligature for closing the mouths of arteries rendered this operation less painfid, formidable, and uncertain ; but the difficulty and danger attending it continued to be very great, and the instances of recover^' were extremely rare. Surgeons, therefore, turned their attention to the other mode of natural ciu*e, and endeavoured to promote coagula- Edinburgh Journal of Medical Science.

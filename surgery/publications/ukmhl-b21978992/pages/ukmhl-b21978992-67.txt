MORTIFICATION. 35 whether the process should be confided entire- ly to the power of the system, or be anticipat- ed by amputation, in order to hasten recovery, and provide a better stump than could he ex- pected if the bones were allowed to separate without any covering being provided for them. (Fig. 2.) On the whole, it seems best to steer a middle course, and to avoid inteiderence until the soft parts are nearly debiched, (Fig. 3.) when they may be easily dissected a little up- wards so as to expose the bone and allow it to be divided with a saw, or disarticulated sufiiciently high to let the in- teguments meet over, and af- 3^ ford the necessary protection to its extremity. It is a curious and not less important fact, that when the • cause is of a local nature and 1 limited extent, the effect is 1 not always confined to the I partconceraed. Thus, though j the mortification caused by ■ the wheel of a waggon pas- sing over a limb is often I confined to the bruised tex- tures at the seat of the in- - jury, on otlier occasions of a ‘ similar kind, the destructive ^ process rapidly diflPuses itsellj jand proves fatal, unless I checked by timely araputa- ! tion. A fine healthy boy of 114, the son of a farmer near I Edinbui-gh, suffered a simple I fracture of his fore-arm. An attentive and experienced practitioner I applied a, bandage, but, residing at some distance, w'as not aware of i t e swelling that subsequently took place ; and on visiting his patient ■| ound the limb black and cold. I was then sent for to amputate e arm, which had become swollen up to the shoulder, ]>itted on iressure, and displayed a dusky red colour. Thougli the case leemcd nearly hopeless, I performed the operation at the joint.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 152 plication. The distal phalanx, it may be said, never stands in need of removal by itself, since all the morbid conditions to which it is subject from injury or disease admit of re- paration ; and it is of course always advisable to retain the extremity of the finger with its protecting nail, even though the bone, in whole or part, may be taken away. And when more than the distal phalanx must be re- moved, it is almost always better, in respect to appear- ance, as well as use, to amputate the whole fingers. When a portion of the metacarpal bone requires to be removed, the best method is to apply the point of the knife at the part where the bone requires to be divided, and cut down on each side of it, in the angle formed by the integuments between the fingers, so as to make the incisions meet below, opposite the metacarpo-digital arti culation ; and then divide the bone by means of the cutting-pliers here represented, which were introduced into the service of surgery by Mr Lis- ton, at an early period of his practice,—and from their extensive utility may be regarded as the most valuable addition that has been made to the modern armoury of the profession. \VTien the metacarpal bone of the thumb is the one con- cerned, a portion of it may be removed by making two incisions, commencing where the bone requires to be divided, enclosing the thumb, and meeting together at the angle of union between it and the fore-finger. If it is neces- sary, the whole bone may be easily disarticxilated. The thumb and fore-finger being held separate, the surgeon should cut upwai’ds in the angle be- tween them as fai* as the bones will allow him, then, turning the edge of the knife laterally, he will at once enter the joint, and having cut tluough it, may readily form a sufficient flap to cover the raw surface in carrying his knife outwards. The same processes are proper for removing the metacarpal bone of the little finger in part or in whole; but in tliis case the external flap must be formed previous to the disarticulation, wliich is most readily effected by introducing the knife into the joint from the ulnar side.

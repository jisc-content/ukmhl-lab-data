When small, it is extremely moveable, and seems upon ex- amination through the integuments, as if it could be pushed about from one part of the breast to another.

This kind of tumour is generally met with in unmarried women between the ages of twenty and forty. It grows with very different degrees of rapidity, sometimes remain- ing for years no larger than a walnut, and at others in the same period attaining such a size as to weigh several pounds. There is seldom much pain referred to the breast affected, and when it is complained of, the mental uneasiness, excited by apprehension of cancer, is probably the principal cause of its production. If the tumour is small, it may be cut out to relieve the patientâ€™s anxiety, and if so large as to occasion inconvenience, its extirpa- tion is more decidedly indicated. In the former case, it is neces- sary to make merely a simple incision through the integuments and substance of the mamma, so as to lay open freely the capsule of condensed cellular membrane which surrounds the tumour, and loosely adheres to it; but in the latter, where the morbid growth.

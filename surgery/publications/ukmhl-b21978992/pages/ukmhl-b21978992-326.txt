282 PRINCIPLES OF SI IIGERY. any trouble to the |«itient, but experience has ascertained, that, instead of this salutary process, the irritation of its presence is more apt to excite a fatal inflammation, and there seems little induce- ment to inciu* this risk wlien the alleged advantage of the practice is fairly weighed. When the lung is wounded it must suffer a complete contraction, since the air, though not allowed to enter by the external wound in sufficient quantity to occupy the simce required for its entire collapse, will find a ready entrance from the branches of the trachea which are wounded; and the external sm-- face of the lung being thus maintained permanently in equilibrio with the internal one as to the pressure of the atmosphere, the elasticity of the organ will meet with no obstacle to the exercise of its contractile tendency. The cavity for the reception of the blood must therefore be very capacious; and when the yielding nature of its parietes towards the diaphragm and the other side of the chest is taken into account, it seems difficult to conceive the possibility of making effectual pressure on the cut surface of the lung by retaining the fluid. For these reasons, it appeal’s to be the more prudent practice to afford free exit to the blood, by keeping the original wound open, or making a new one in a more convenient situation, while by bleeding from the arm, and the other means that promote the ces- sation of hemorrhage by inducing coagulation in the wounded ves- sels, the farther flow of blood from the lung is restrained. If the wound of the parietes is small, or near the upper part of the chest, internal hemorrhage may take place to a great extent without any external indication of its existence, especially if, as sometimes, but very rarely, happens, it should proceed from one of the intercostal arteries. Various symptoms of blood accumu- lating in the chest have been observed and carefully described as affording the means of recognizing it Of these the most important arc, coldness of the extremities—clammy perspiration of the face— a pur])lc colour of the cheek, on the side affected—inability of lying on the sound side of the body, which is probably the cause of the preceding symptom—extreme oppression of breathing—a small fluttering pulse—suppression of urine—and a want of the usual resonance wdien the affected side of the chest is subjected to per- cussion. As all these signs, and also those more questionable ones which have not been thought deserving of mention, whether taken together or separately, must be regarded as insufficient to yield

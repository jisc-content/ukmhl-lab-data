SUPPURATION. 57 CHAPTER VI. SUPPURATION. Pus. 4 Suppuration consists in the formation of a peculiar fluid named i Pus, which possesses the following characters : It has nearly the consistence of cream : it has a pale yellow or straw colom’; it oc- ■ casions no smell w'hile cold ; hut when heated to the temperature ( of the body emits a faint odour ; it is opaque, and when examined 1 by the microscope, appears to be composed of globules suspended i in a transparent fluid ; it sinks in water ; it is coagulated by mu- 1 riate of ammonia; and sometimes has its fluidity diminished, mere- 1 ly by removal from the body. It was formerly believed that pus originated from putrefaction or degeneration of the blood and other fluid or solid pai*ts; and a loss of substance or breach in the continuity of the solids was thought es- < sential to its formation. It is now ascertained that pus is produced by a peculiar secreting action of the capillary vessels, which may occur without any solution of continuity. The mucous mem- ^ branes, after being inflamed, frequently take on the suppurative action; and the piuulent secretion of granulations may be quoted as another instance, since the pus is discharged here at once from the I vessels. A granulating surface in several respects beai’s much re- semblance to a mucous membrane, and may be regarded as a tem- \ porary covering instead of skin. Pus varies very much in consist- t ence, colour, and other properties, from admixture of blood, the nature of the part, or the constitution of the patient Suppuration may be divided into superficial and interstitial. Superficial Suppuration. Superficial suppm'ation is that which takes place from the sm’- face ot the mucous membranes, as the urethra or conjmictiva. It Avas not admitted by the older siugeons, who accounted for the dis-

THROAT. 271 his mouth, was all at once seized with a violent cough, which has continued to recur in paroxysms with variable intervals, although no other symptom of local inflammation or constitutional disturb- ance can be perceived, the presumption will be strong that this ac- cident has happened; and if the sensation of something moving in the trachea should also be felt, there can remain little room for doubting that a foreign substance has entered the air passage. It has occasionally happened that a violent cough proved the means of cure by ejecting the foreign body through the glottis, but no reliance can be placed on this rare chance; and the danger of con- tinued irritation, suflPocation from the inordinate secretion of mucus which is excited, or suppuration of the lungs, fully warrants imme- diate recourse to tracheotomy. When the operation is performed \vith this view, it should be conducted in the same way that has been described, with the ex- ception that, instead of a tube being introduced into the trachea, the edges of the opening must be held asunder by a couple of hooks, until the source of irritation is expelled by the forcible stream of air which it occasions. Should the bit of bone, pea, nut, or whatever may have entered, not appear at the orifice, a pair of curved forceps may be introduced upwards to search the larynx, and, if necessary, the cincoid cartilage shoidd be divided to aftbrd more room for this purpose. The for- ceps may also be directed downwards if there is reason to suspect that the foreign body is impacted in one of the bronchi, of which the right oue, as being the larger, and more directly in the course of the trachea, will be more likely to contain it. In cases of urgency, either from the presence of a foreign body, or sudden swelling of the parts concerned, though the proper ap- paratus for performing tracheotomy cannot be procured, the pa- tient sliould not be permitted to die of suffocation. A pen-knife being tlmust into the space between the thyroid and cricoid carti- lages, as near as possible to the former, and carried down so as to divide the latter, will afford a free aperture, the edges of which may be kept apart by a tliin bit of wood, or the expanded branches of a small pair of forceps. Removal of Foreign Bodies from the Pharynx and CEsophagus, The detention of matters, in passing from the mouth towards the stomach, is owing either to their size or their figure. If prevented from descending on account of their bulk merely, they are generally

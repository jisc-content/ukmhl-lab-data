PUINCIPLES OF SURGERY. 500 Obstruction of the Eustachian Tube, and Perforation of the Membrane of the Tt/mpanum. The Eustachian tube is liable to be obstructed at its pharyngeal extremity by a variety of circumstances, of which the most deserv- ing of notice are, thickening and adhesion of its lining membrane, consequent on inflammation of the throat, enlargement of the ton- sils, and nasal polypus. It has been already mentioned in regard to the two last of these afiections, that they occasionally give rise to deafness in this way, which is relieved by their removal. But when the tube is closed, the only method of restoring the patientâ€™s hearing is to remove the obstruction, by introducing probes or in- jections through the nose into the contracted or obliterated tube. This operation is so extremely difficult and uncertain, that it can- not be regarded as affording any real advantage; and it has there- fore been proposed in such cases, to make an opening in the mem- brane of the tympanum, so as to place it in equilibrium as to the pressure of the atmosphere, on its internal as well as external sur- face, Numerous attempts have been made with this view, and fre- quently with temporary benefit. The return of deafness, which tlie patient has almost always suffered, has been ascribed to clos- ure of the aperture, and various modes of making it have been pro- posed, in order to prevent the edges of the wound from uniting. It is probable, however, that the relapse depends on other circum- stances, as it is not easy to conceive how the edges of such wounds could unite, except as a rare accident, and since the deafness has returned, even after a part of the membrane was actually re- moved.

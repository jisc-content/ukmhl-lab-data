JOINTS. the manual strength of one or two stout assistants, or this inert by the power of the pulley. In all cases of dislocation, except haps sometimes where the hip-joint is concerned, mere manua tension is sufficient, and it ought, therefore, in general, to be ferred, being more readily obtained and also more easily managed than the pulley. The best bandage for applying the extend- ing force is a skein of worsted, or a folded shawl, wliich must be securely fastened to prevent it from slipping in the process. The best noose for this purpose is either the clove-hitch, as it is called by sailors, and which will be understood from the fi- gure in the margin, or another, which is preferred by the French surgeons. It is executed by placing the band across the limb in this form. then drawing each end of it through the opposite loop, so that result is as here represented. The strength of the patient’s muscles may be weakened by bleeding—the wai-m bath—tobacco injections—and the tar- trate of antimony, given in solution in small doses frequently repeated. Of ; these means the first and last mentioned are the most convenient, but it is seldom ’ necessary to employ either of them. The i involuntary resistance may also be less- * cned by preventing fixture of the thorax ■ which being the central point of attach- I ment directly or indirectly to all the muscles of the body, is instinctively ren- • dered immoveable whenever any strong > effort is to be made. But if the patient > is obliged to speak, this cannot be done, and consequently the opposing force is diminished. With a simil ' view it is sometimes advantageous to effect the extension sudden

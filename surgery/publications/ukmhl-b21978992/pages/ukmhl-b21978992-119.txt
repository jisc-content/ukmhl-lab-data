The impoverished limb becomes cold and nnmb; and if stimulating means be employed to rouse the weakened actions, they readily excite inflammation, which speedily runs on to gangrene and mortification. On dissection, the vessels are found contracted, thick- ened in their coats, and firmly ])lug- ged vdtli a fiiTti, brown, fibrinous coaguliun. The internal coat is sometimes ruptured or irreguhuly lacerated, so as to impede the chan- nel of the vessel. Obstruction of the vessels with coagulum used to be considered a regular conse- ([uence of mortification; but it is now ascertained to be by no means a common occurrence; and when it does hap])cn, ought probably ra- ther to be regarded jis a cause than an effect of the mortification. In- stead of the disease leading to the death of the part, there is reasoji to believe that it sometimes tcr- ■ niinates in recovery, owing to the blood passing through anastomos- j ing vessels, which gi-adually en- large, so as to convey adequate 1 nourishment i ()])portunity is seldom afforded to treat the primar}' inflammation, I and its diagnosis would not be easy. ;; ‘ In case of its being discovered sufficiently early, the jiropcr re- medies would be local bleeding and fomentations, with calomel and opium given internally. After ; the obstruction is completed, which may be learned by the cold- ness, numbness, want of pulsation, and bistory of the case, the iit- mos care must be taken to protecd the weakened part from dc- piession on the one hand, and excitement on the other.

PRINCIPLES or SURGERY. 490 CHAPTER XXIV. NOSE. Extraction of Foreign Bodies from the Nose. Children frequently inti-oduce small bodies, such as peas or cherry-stones, into the nostrils, where they hre sometimes detained in consequence of the enlargement which they suffer, the swelling that takes place in the parietes of the cavity, or simply from their being pushed in with greater force than can be applied from within for their expulsion. The immediate inconvenience is seldom con- siderable, and the presence of the foreign body often escapes obser- vation for a long while. Sooner or later a purulent discharge and ulceration are induced, and it may happen that surgical assistance is required on account of these symptoms months after the body has been introduced, and when its existence is not known, either from having never been discovered, or from having been completely forgotten. In all cases, therefore, of matter being discharged from one nostril of a child, the surgeon should search the cavity to as- certain if it contains any foreign substance. This is most effectu- ally done by means of the forceps represented in Plate IV. Eig. 2. They should be introduced with the branches fully expanded, and held in a vertical direction, parallel with the septum of the nose. From the flattened shape of the nostril they may thus be jiassed behind any body, however firmly impacted in it, and, after being fairly introduced, they should be closed so as to seize any thing that may be present. One or two trials conducted in this way wi enable the surgeon to satisfy himself whether or no there is a fo- reign body lodged in the cavity, and to extract it if deteetc^. When the extraneous substance has been recently introduced, the process of removal should be performed in the same manner. Epistaxis, or Bleeding from the Nose. Hemorrhage from the nose frequently takes place, either com- mencing spontaneously, or being induced by the injury attending

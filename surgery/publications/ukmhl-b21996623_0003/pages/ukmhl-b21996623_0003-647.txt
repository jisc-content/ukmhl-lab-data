ON THE CURE OF THE POPLITEAL ANEURISM. 621 teal artery, of an oval form, situated between the heads of the gastro- cnemius muscle. In this case the femoral artery was so much diseased that probably neither amputation nor any other operation with which we are acquainted would have been attended with success. But as that is a circumstance which rarely happens, and can never be ascertained during the personâ€™s life, it ought not to be considered as an objection to the operation, though its possible existence must always render the event somewhat uncertain. The internal surface of the artery in the present case became inflamed, without admitting the union of its sides, as happens when the operation succeeds. This inflammation, although probably owing chiefly to the diseased state of the artery, may yet in part have been produced by the neglect of proper attention in regard to diet and rest previous to the operation, and more particularly by the indulgence in wine after it.

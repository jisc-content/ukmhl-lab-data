A TREATISE ON THE BLOOD, INFLAMMATION, AND GUNSHOT WOUNDS. INTRODUCTION. THE following pages, treating of inflammation, were first arranged in the year 1762, at Belleisle, after the complete reduction of that place. They were compiled from notes and memorandums of observations made in the course of twelve yearsâ€™ residence in London. During this space, my time was occupied in my education under the late Dr. Hunter, and partly in assisting him. In the winter season I was principally em- ployed in the dissecting-room, where I taught the practical part of ana- tomy ; in the summer I attended the hospitals. The truth of these ob- servations was during the siege of Belleisle in some degree put to the test, by comparing them with many cases of -wounds which were attended with inflammation. From the frequency of gun-shot wounds at that place, I was naturally led to arrange my thoughts upon the subject, and was induced to select them more particularly for the illustration of my opinions on inflammation. About the year 1770, when I began my lec- tures on the principles of disease, inflammation was the subject of a considerable part of them; and from that time till this, though I have been extending and correcting the materials, my principles remain the same. To distinguish the different species of inflammation*, and to * In the course of this work I very often make use of the word species or specific, by which I only mean peculiarities or distinctions, and probably the term is much too loose in its application; for, as we are not entirely acquainted with the specific dif- ferences in disease, we may call that a species which more properly ranks as a genus, class, &c. Of morbid poisons we can make a correct arrangement j but with regard to disease arising from peculiarities in the constitution, we have no such absolute guides. VOL. m. u

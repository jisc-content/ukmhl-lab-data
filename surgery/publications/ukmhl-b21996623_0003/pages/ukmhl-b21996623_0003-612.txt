586 OBSERVATIONS ON THE INFLAMMATION, ETC. they do not appear to have attracted much attention until comparatively a recent period. Irom 1/8-1, the date of Mr. Hunter's paper, to 1815, when Mr. Hodgson’s valuable treatise on the diseases of the arteries and veins appeared, only a very few cases are recorded tn the literature of this country. Bichat, in his Anatomic General,, does not appear to have been acquainted with the complaint, at least with that peculiar form of suppurative inflammation to which the veins are liable, while the French journals, with one single exception, are equally silent on the subject. The successive publica- tions which have since appeared, of Abernethy, Hodgson, Travers, Carmichael. Arnott, &c., have thrown much light on the pathology of phlebitis, while they have at the same time not only pointed out the frequent complication of phlebitis with other affec- tions, as, tor example, accidents and mrgical operations, but also tha» it is often the cause of death in other cases where it was not previously suspected, especially in puerperal women. Among the most remarkable circumstances brought to light in the course of these investigations, must be mentioned the resemblance which the constitutional sym- ptoms attending this form of inflammation, bear to those produced bv injection of putrid or infectious matters into the current of the blood, and also the frequent occurrence of secondary suppurations in various parts of the body and often in many parts of the same body. The cause of these peculiarities has not yet been satisfactorily determined, nor has it yet been decided what mode of treatment is most generally eligible. Experience has shown that little reliance ts to be placed on the application of compresses above the inflamed part, as advised by the author.]

564 OF TIIE TREATMENT OF GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. arid do nothing, except bleeding, which in cases of wounded intestines is seldom necessaiy. As he was extremely thirsty, and could not retain anything in his stomach, which, if he could, would probably have been productive of mischief, by giving a greater chance of extravasation ; would not the tepid bath have been of service, to have allowed of fluids to enter the constitution ? It is very possible that a wound of the gall-bladder, but more readily ot the ductus communis, and also of the pancreatic duct, will produce the same effects, although not so quickly ; and it may be observed, that <i w ound in them could not be benefited by any adhesions that could take place, because the secreted fluids could never, most probably, get into the right channel again, and would therefore be the cause of keep- ing the external wound open to discharge the contents, as we find to be the case in the disease called fistula lachrymalis, as also when the duct of the parotid gland is divided. Wounds of parts that have been only deadened will be very similar to the above-stated penetrating wounds, but they will differ from them in effects, arising from a slough separating from a containing viscus; for whenever the slough comes away the extraneous or contained matter of that viscus will escape by the wound, such as the contents of the stomach, intestines, ureters, bladder, etc., the two last of which will be similar; or the slough may escape by either of these outlets ; whereas in the former kind of wounds any of the contents that could possibly escape would immediately pass into the cavity of the abdomen. The periods of these symptoms appearing after the accident will be according to the time of separation, which may be in eight, ten, twelve, or fourteen days. These new symptoms, although in general very disagreeable, will not be dangerous *, for all the danger is over before they can appear; but that the orifice should afterwards continue, and become either an arti- ficial anus or urethra, is a thing to be avoided; though they commonly close up, and the contents are directed the right way : in such cases no- thing is to be done but dressing the wound superficially, and when the contents of the wounded viscus become less, we may hope for a cure. The following case explains the foregoing remarks : A young gentleman was shot through the body. The musket was loaded with three balls, but there were only two orifices where they en- tered, and also only two where they came out, one of the balls having followed one of the others; that there were three that went through him * IIow far the contents of tiie stomach escaping through a wound might not be at- tended with bad consequences I cannot pretend to say.

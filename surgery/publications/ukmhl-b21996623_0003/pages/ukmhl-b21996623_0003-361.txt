THE ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. 335 i' lular membrane, in common, give an acute pain, which rather rouses than oppresses, if not too great. All of this will be further mentioned when We treat of each part. One cause of this variety of sensations, according as the parts in- flamed are vital or not vital, seems to consist in the different systems of materia vita; with which those parts are supplied, having, probably, nerves peculiarly constructed for this purpose; for all the parts which aro supplied with branches from the par vagum and intercostals affect the patient with lowness of spirits from the very first attack of the inflam- mation : the actions of those parts are involuntary, and therefore are more immediately connected with the living principle, and consequently that principle is affected whenever anything affects these nerves. The other system of the materia vitae, when affected by this inflammation, rather rouses at first the constitution, which shows signs of strength, unless the parts have rather weak powers of recovery, such as tendon, bone, etc., or are far from the heart, in which cases the signs of weak- ness sooner or later appear; hence it would seem that this difference in the constitution, arising from the difference in parts and their situ- ation, arises from the constitution having a disease which it cannot so easily manage, as it can in those parts which are not vital, and in parts that are near to the heart; which circumstances alone become a cause of 1 irritation in the constitution. ยง.3. The Heat of Parts in Inflammation. When I was treating of the blood I observed that the heat of the animal was commonly considered as connected with that fluid; but as I had not made up my mind about the cause of the heat of animals, not being satisfied with the opinions hitherto given, I did not endeavour to offer any account of that property; but I shall now consider this power when the animal is under disease, where it would appear often to be diminished, and often increased, and of course the animal often becomes | colder and hotter than its natural temperature. There is an endeavour to bring the heat of a living body to the tem- perature of the surrounding medium, but in the more perfect animals j this is prevented by the powers in the animal to support its own tem- perature, more especially in and near the vital parts1*; therefore, in I [This uniformity of temperature is not, however, by any means so universal, even in health and in the higher animals, as has often been supposed. De la lloche and lierger found that warm-blooded mammalia, exposed for long periods to a high tempe-

OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 191 immediate use, interwoven with the whole, for a stoppage of respiration produces a stoppage of circulation, and a restoration of respiration pro- the heart are dependent on the influence of the ganglionic system. This opinion is less capable of being proved or disproved than either of the others, in consequence of the ex- treme difficulty of separating the heart from its connexions, or at least all the nerves from the heart; so that though the heart of a turtle, apparently detached from its con- nexions, and completely removed from the body, will sometimes continue to beat for nearly an hour, yet we cannot be certain that this action does not depend more or less on the nervous filaments which enter into its substance. Sir Charles Bell has moulded these various opinions in accordance with his own pe- culiar views of the nervous system, making the ordinary action of the heart to depend on the ganglionic system, but its connexion with the respiratory and sensorial functions to be derived through the cerebro-spinal nerves or par vagum; but it must be obvious that such an hypothesis is open to several of the objections urged against the opinions just stated. Not satisfied with any of the above-mentioned views, Mr. Herbert Mayo has offered an entirely different explanation of the matter. Finding that the natural state of the voluntary muscles, in the absence of any special stimuli, is that of permanent relaxation or contraction,—that when irritated, they contract by a single and momentary effort, and when divided, instantly retract; that the involuntary muscles, on the contrary, retract slowly and gradually when divided, and when mechanically stimulated take on not one, but a series of actions,—he argues that the natural state of the latter class is that of alternate relaxation and contraction, and that consequently no special stimulus is required to induce a succession of actions in these parts, “ For the brief period,” he observes, “during which it is reasonable to suppose that the heart retains its perfect organization, no stimulus seems required to excite it to contract. The alternation of action and repose seems to be natural to its irritable fibre, or to be the immediate re- sult of its structure ; they appear not, like similar phenomena in the diaphragm, to de- pend upon a series of impressions transmitted from the brain or spinal chord.” There are some facts which seem to favour this view, and indeed to lead to the belief that incitability and contractility are properties inherent in and peculiar to muscular fibre totally independent of the nervous system, and that in fact the actual relation of this system to the muscular is that of supplying the stimulus to and regulating the ac- tions of the latter in obedience to the necessities, exterior and organic, of the con- stitution ; for, 1st, there is no proportion between the degree of contractility enjoyed by different muscles and the number and quantity of their nerves; while, 2nd, local forms of paralysis sometimes occur in which no agent, either electrical or galvanic, can induce contractions in the part, although the nerves going to that part are completely un- changed. In fact, those parts which possess the smallest number of nerves, as the heart, the intestines, the stomach, &c., are uniformly found to retain the power of spontaneous contraction after death for the longest period of time, while even the voluntary muscles are obedient to the same law, and retain their contractile property much longer where the animal has been stunned previously to the experiment being made. The connexion, however, which exists between the due supply of nervous influence and the power of contraction in the muscles, is so intimate as scarcely to allow us on these grounds to consider them in any other light than as cause and effect; and one of the most weighty objections to Mr. Mayo’s hypothesis is, that it obliges us either to consider the former as not essential to the latter in the case of the muscles generally, or to draw a stronger line of distinction between the causes of action of the voluntary and involuntary muscles than seems in nature to exist. It appears to me that we have not yet a sufficient number of data on which to decide

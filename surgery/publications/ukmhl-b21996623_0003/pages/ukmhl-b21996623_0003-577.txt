OF THE TREATMENT OF GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. ,551 If the opening in the skin should be objected to as being too small, and thereby forming an obstruction to the exit of the slough, etc., I think that in general it is not; for the skin is kept open by its own elasti- city, as we see in all wounds : this elasticity muscles and many other parts have not; and in general the opening made by a ball is much larger than those made by pointed instruments; for I have already observed that there is often a piece of the skin carried in before the ball, espe- cially if it passed with considerable velocity, besides the circular slough; so that there is really in such cases a greater loss of substance; there- fore whatever matter or extraneous body there is, when it comes to the skin it will find a free passage out. Nor does the wound in the skin in general heal sooner than the bottom; and indeed in many cases not so soon, because the skin is generally the part that has suffered most. However, this is not an absolute rule, for the skin sometimes heals first; but I have found this to be the case as often where openings had been made as in those where they had not; and this will depend upon circumstances or peculiarities; such as the bottom being at a consider- able distance, with extraneous bodies, and having no disposition to heal, tending to a fistula; and I have observed in those cases, that the wound or opening made by the surgeon generally skinned to a small hole before the bottom of the wound was closed, which brings it to the state it Mould have been in, if it had not been dilated at all, especially if there are extraneous bodies still remaining; for an extraneous body causes and keeps up the secretion of matter, or rather keeps up the disease at the bottom of the wound, by which means the healing disposition of its mouth is in some degree destroyed. I.et me state a case of this last description. Suppose a wound made with a ball; that wound (from circumstances) is not to heal in six months, because the extraneous bodies, etc. cannot be extracted, or work out sooner, or some other circumstance prevents the cure in a shorter time: open that wound as freely as may be thought necessary, I will engage that it will be in a monthâ€™s time in the same state with a similar wound that has not been opened, so that the whole advantage (if there is any) must be before it comes to this state; but it is very seldom that anything of consequence can be done in that time, because the extra- neous bodies do not come out at first so readily as they do at last, for the inflammation and tumefaction, which'extend beyond that very opening, generally keep them in; and if the wound is opened on their account at first, it ought to be continued to the very last. Upon the same principle, opening on account of extraneous bodies at first cannot be of so much service as opening some time after ; for the suppuration, with its leading causes, viz. inflammation and sloughing, all along the

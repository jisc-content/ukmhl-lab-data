Since bodies of persons who die suddenly, and even by violent death, as well as those who die soon after a considerable operation, are not ca- pable of being preserved so long as those who have been ill for some time; and as those who have a considerable operation performed upon them, as the amputation of a leg, do not so readily recover as those who have been long ill, may not the more ready production of death and the more ready production of putrefaction be owing to the same principle, one more readily running into the action of death as also more readily into the action of putrefaction ? But it is very probable that the action producing quick putrefaction is an action prior to absolute death.

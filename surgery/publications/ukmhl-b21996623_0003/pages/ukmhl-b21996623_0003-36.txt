PART I. CHAPTER I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE BLOOD. As the blood is allowed by all to have a considerable share in inflam- mation, or at least to be particularly affected by it, becoming, by its ap- pearances, one of the signs or symptoms of its existence, and as the blood is a material object with me in the theory of inflammation, I shall begin mjr treatise with its natural history, a previous knowledge of which is the more requisite, because the accounts of this fluid hitherto given will hardly explain any of its uses in the machine in health, or of its changes in disease. The heart and vessels are very active in inflammations ; and as their structures and actions have not hitherto been understood, I have sub- joined to the natural history of the blood an account of the structure of the heart and vessels, together with their actions in the machine; to which I have added one use of the absorbents not hitherto known. As every natural action of the body depends, for its perfection, on a number of circumstances, we are led to conclude, that all the various combining actions are established while the body is in health, and well- disposed ; but this does not take place in diseased actions, for disease, on the contrary, consists in the want of this very combination; and dis- eased actions, therefore, vary according to many natural circumstances, of which I propose to point out a few of the most striking instances. Inflammation must have some exciting cause, and the same cause will produce an effect under one circumstance which it will not under another. I have therefore begun with the supposition of an injury, attended with such circumstances as do not excite inflammation, which will form a strong contrast to those which do, the opposite effects mu- tually illustrating each other ; but as inflammation is a very general ac- tion of the vessels in disease, and is of various kinds, I have previously given a short account of several of the most common sorts of inflamma- tion, which will explain the rest.

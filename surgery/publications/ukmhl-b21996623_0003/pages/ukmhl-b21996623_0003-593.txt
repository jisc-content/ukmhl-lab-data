OF TIIE TREATMENT OF GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 567 that cavity, which most probably would prove fatal, and which would be equally so if no viscus was wounded; but it would appear that the cavity of the thorax does not so readily fall into this inflammation from a gun-shot wound as we should at first imagine; nor can we suppose that the adhesive inflammation readily takes place between the lungs and pleura round the orifice, as we described in the wounds of the ab- domen, because these parts are not under the same circumstances that other contained and containing parts are ; for in every other case the contained and containing have the same degree of flexibility or propor- tion in size. The brain and the skull have not the same flexibility, but they bear the same proportion in size. The lungs immediately collapse when either wounded themselves or when a wound is made into the chest, and, from this circumstance, are not allowed to heal by the first intention, but become by much too small for the cavity of the thorax, which space must be filled either with air or blood, or both, so that ad- hesion cannot readily take place : but it very often happens that the lungs have previously adhered, which will frequently be an advantage. In the cases of stabs, especially if with a sharp instrument, the ves- sels wall bleed freely, but the external wound will collapse, and cut off all external communication. If the lungs are wounded in the same manner, we must expect a considerable bleeding from them, and this bleeding will be into the general cavity of the thorax (if the lungs at this part have not previously adhered there), and likewise into the cells of the lungs or bronchiae, which will be known by producing a cough, and in consequence of it a bleeding at the mouth; for the blood that is extravasated into the air-cells of the lungs will be coughed up by the trachea, and by that means will become a certain symptom of the lungs being wounded; but that which gets into the cavity of the thorax can- not escape, and therefore must remain till the absorbents take it up; which they will do if it is only in small quantity; but if in large quan- tity this extravasated blood will produce symptoms of another kind. The symptoms of these accidents are : first, a great lowness, which proceeds from the nature of the parts wrounded, and perhaps a fainting lrom the quantity of blood lost to the circulation ; but this will be in proportion to the quantity and quickness with which it was lost. A load in the breast will be felt, but more from a sensation of this kind than from any real weight; and a considerable difficulty in breathing. This difficulty in breathing will arise from the pain the patient will have in expanding the lungs in inspiration, and will also proceed from the muscles of respiration of that side being wounded, and this will continue for some time from the succeeding inflam- mation : it will hinder the expansion of the thorax on that side, and

472 THE ULCERATIVE INFLAMMATION. observe that the absorption which does not produce suppuration may take place either from pressure made by sound parts upon diseased parts, or by diseased upon sound parts; as the effect that the pressure of the coagulated blood has in aneurisms, the moving blood in the same, which is a sound part, contained in diseased arteries not capable of supporting the pressure of the moving blood ; as also many tumours, which are dis- eased parts, pressing upon natural sound parts ; and these diseased parts are simply endowed with life, which I apprehend makes some difference in the effects respecting the formation of pus; also uncommon pressure made by such substances as are not endowed with any irritating quality sufficient to produce the suppurative inflammation, as a piece of glass, a lead bullet, etc., all of which I shall nowr more fully explain. Of this first division, viz. from pressure without suppuration, we have several instances, as in aneurisms, especially w'hen they are in the aorta, and principally at the curve ; and when arrived at a considerable size, so as to press against the surrounding parts, particularly against the back- bone, as also against the sternum; all of which will be according to the situation of the aneurism : we find in such cases, that from the dilatation of the artery (which arises from the force of the heart) the artery is pressed against those bones, and that the substance of the artery at the part pressed is taken into the constitution. This absorption begins at the external surface of the artery, where it comes in contact with the bone, and continues there till the whole artery is absorbed; then the bone itself comes in contact with the circulating blood, and not being naturally intended to be washed by moving blood, the bone or bones are also absorbed from this pressure and motion of the blood against them. The adhesive or strengthening disposition takes place in the surrounding parts, and is of great service here, as it unites the circum- ference of the unabsorbed part of the artery to the surrounding parts; as also the cellular membrane beyond the surface of absorption (when in soft parts), similar to the preceding adhesive inflammation going be- fore ulceration in an abscess ; but it is here much stronger, for strength is wanted as well as adhesion while it is dilating; so that a cavity of some strength for the moving blood is always kept entire, and no extra- vasation can take place, nor can the parts readily give way. Another instance of this absorption occurs in those cases where living tumours make their way to the skin without the formation of an abscess. I once saw a remarkable instance of this in a Highland soldier in the Dutch service, who had a solid tumour formed, either in the substance of the brain, or, what is more probable, upon it, viz. in the pia-matcr, for it seemed to be covered by that membrane ; the tumour was oblong, above an inch thick, and two or more inches long; it was sunk near its

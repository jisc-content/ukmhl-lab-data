THE ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. O* 1 O/ 1 head-ache, of long standing, by the loss of a leg, which may he con- sidered as a proof of this ; but he afterwards died of a complaint in his head, very similar to an apoplexy. It might be supposed, on the other hand, that the temporary cure was the cause of the apoplexy. Inflammation, in consequence only of a disease in a part, appears to he under the same circumstances with respect to resolution; hut an in- flammation arising from a preceding indisposition in the constitution (commonly called critical) has always been classed among those which should not be cured locally, and this has got the term of repulsion : it has been insisted on that the inflammation should rather be encouraged, and suppuration produced, if possible. If the inflammation is really a concentration of the constitutional complaint, and that by not allowing it to rest here, the same disposition is really diffused over the whole animal again, and at liberty to fix on some other part, it certainly would be better to encourage its stay; but in such cases it is always to be un- derstood that the inflammation is in such parts as will readily admit of a cure when suppuration takes place; for if the disease be otherwise si- tuated, then the cure of the constitution by suppuration will be a mode of cure which will reflect back another disease upon it, under which it will sink: resolution of inflammation, therefore, in the first of these si- tuations, should if possible be brought about. For instance, many deep- seated inflammations, if allowed to suppurate, would of themselves most certainly kill. This might be illustrated by the gout, when either in the head or stomach, for when in such parts it had better be repelled, and left to find another part less connected with life, which, if in the feet, would be called repelling of it; but still it-does not appear to me necessary that it should suppurate, for suppuration is only a consequence of the inflammation, and not an immediate consequence of the original or constitutional disease, but a secondary one* : as suppuration, there- fore, is only a thing superadded, and as we shall find that inflammation generally subsides when suppuration comes on, I see no reason why in- flammation, in the present case, should not as well subside by resolution as by suppuration: however, it may be supposed that although suppu- ration is not the natural or immediate effect of the disease, yet as it is a continued local action, and the thing sought for by the constitution, rim is contrary to the common received opinion, but it is according to my idea of suppuration; for I have all along considered inflammation as the disease, and suppura- t.on only as a consequence of that disease, and have supposed the disease to he gone ;rr°: h".'t&kC".Place; ^.according to the common opinion, suppuration ie iing to he wished for, because all diseases arose from humours ; but as we have . 0"CC men"onca humo“«» therefore made it no part of our system, wc mi.,, al>o drop it at present.

He was almost immediately seized with a considerable discharge of blood from the lungs to near a quart, by the mouth, which showed that the lungs were consider- ably wounded, for from the situation of the external wound we were sure that the stomach could not be injured. His breathing soon became difficult and painful, and his pulse quick ; he was bled ; these symptoms increased so fast that every one thought him dying. He could only lie on his back; for if he lay on the sound side, he could not breathe in the least, and the pain would not let him lie on the unsound side; the easiest position was an erect posture, which obliged him to sit in a chair for several days ; when he coughed he was in great pain; he very seldom spat with the cough, and never discharged any blood after the second day, by which we supposed that the bleeding was stopped in the lun-s While the parts were in a state of inflammation he was in great pa'in. his breathing excessively quick, and his pulse hard and extremely quick,’ but as the inflammation went off, he drew his breath in longer strokes! his pain became less, and his pulse not so quick nor so hard ; but this last circumstance varied as he moved his body, coughed, or put him- self into a passion, which he often did. I suspected from both the wound and its effects that there was a good deal of extravasated blood in the cavity of the thorax ; for I considered that the blood which got out of the vessels of the lungs into the wound in the lungs would find a readier passage into the cavity of the thorax than into the cells of the lungs; and indeed every attempt to dilate the thorax would rather act as a sucker upon the mouth of the wound in the lungs, as the pressure of the external air was taken off by that means; 1 proposed the operation for the empyema, because the extra- vasated blood must compress the lungs of that side, and hinder their expansion, and likewise irritate, and at last might produce inflamma- tion. He continued for some days with little variation, but upon the I have often thought it a great pity that we do not accustom ourselves to move one side of our thorax independently of the other, as we from habit move one eyelid independently of the other.

45 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE BLOOD. we commonly find more serum, because it is then squeezed out more forcibly than when the coagulation is formed loosely ; it is not, however, refusal of food, afforded only 3'4 crass, to 10 serum, instead of the usual proportion of 8 to 10.

The proportions of this element of the blood are not influenced so much by age (within the limits of twenty to sixty years) as by the temperament of the indi- vidual. In the sanguine it exceeds by nearly 2 per cent in the male, and 1 per cent in the female, the proportion in the leucophlegmatic, a conclusion which strikingly cor- roborates the opinion of Hunter that the red globules are in some manner connected with the strength or vital energies of the individual, while it points out also the importance which this element probably has on the full development of animal heat. Dr. Christison found that the changes which were wrought on the air by respiration were always in proportion to the quantity of red globules present in the blood; while MM. Prevost and Dumas ascertained the fact that birds (which are the most active of all animals, and possess the highest range of animal temperature,) have the greatest num- ber of red globules, next to them carnivorous quadrupeds, and least of all cold-blooded animals. The constitution does not easily repair considerable losses of the red globules. A single venesection reduced their amount nearly one third, and a severe uterine haemorrhage upwards of 34 per cent. In a case of purpura haemorrhagica, Dr.Whiting found that the red particles did not exceed 40 in 1000 parts of blood, although the common proportion was estimated at not less than 100 to 130. {De Sang. /Egrorum.) Mr. Andrews found that the red globules were diminished upwards of 50 per cent, in calves after the fourth venesection to syncope. (Dubl. Journ., No. 19.) Their quantity is also much diminished by improper or insufficient nutriment, obesity, chronic diseases, and the absence of solar light. III. As to the variations which may occur in the quantity of albumen in common serum.—The serum essentially consists of water and albumen, the proportions of which preserve a remarkable uniformity both in health and disease. The difference in the quantity of albumen seldom exceeds 2 per cent even after considerable losses of blood. It is sometimes deficient in milky serum, and in the serum of patients suffering from dropsy, attended with albuminous urine. In the former cases the albumen is apparently converted into an oleaginous principle, and in the latter into fibrin. The specific gravity of the serum in such cases is generally exceedingly low. Dr. Babington found that milky serum varied from 1019 to 1024, aud that in a case of albuminous urine it did not ex-

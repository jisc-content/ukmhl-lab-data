THE ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. 400 of slight pressure, so that we should understand perfectly its mode of action, where it can prevent a cure, and where it can perform one. In still larger cavities, such as the abdomen, (where often only a partial in- flammation takes place, as'is frequently the case after childbearing and in wounds of this cavity,) we find this inflammation produced; which either prevents the suppurative altogether, or if it does not, it unites the parts surrounding the suppurative centre, and confines the suppuration to that point; and as the abscess increases in size, the adhesive inflam- mation spreads, uniting the parts as it spreads, so that the general ca- vity is excluded. Thus the suppuration is confined to the first point, and forms there a kind of circumscribed abscess, as will be more fully explained hereafter. In inflammations of the pleura or surface of the lungs, the same thing happens, for the adhesive inflammation takes place, and the surfaces are united, which union going before the suppuration confines it to certain limits, so that distinct abscesses are formed by this union of the parts, and the whole cavity of the thorax is not involved in a general suppu- ration ; such cases are called the spurious empyema. The cellular membrane everywhere in the body is united exactly in the same manner; the sides of the cells throw out, or as it were sweat out, the uniting matter, which fills the cavities and unites the whole into one mass. The adhesive inflammation often disposes the parts to form a cyst or bag ; this is generally to cover some extraneous body that does not irri- tate so much as to produce suppuration, such as a sac formed to inclose a bullet, pieces of glass, &c. With the same wise views it unites the parts or cellular membrane which lies between an abscess and the spot where that abscess has a ten- dency to open, as will be more fully explained hereafter, when I come to treat of ulceration. The lungs are so circumstanced as to partake of the effects of two principles: the one, as an internal uniting surface; the other, as a se- creting surface : the last of which constitutes the peculiar structure and use of this viscus ; and the first is no more than the reticular or uniting substance of the air-cells. The internal or the uniting membrane of the lungs unites readily by the adhesive inflammation, as the cellular mem- brane through the body generally; but the air-cells, like the inner sur- face of the urethra, nose, intestines, &c., pass directly into the suppu- rative inflammation, and therefore do not admit of the adhesive, by which means the matter formed is obliged to be coughed up, which produces symptoms peculiar to the parts affected ; and it is perhaps almost im- possible to produce an inflammation on either of those two surfaces with-

582 OBSERVATIONS ON THE INFLAMMATION OF which has by some beeu imputed to the wounding of a tendon, because the tendon of the biceps muscle lies under some of those veins in which we often bleed, and wdien the complaint occurs it is unjustly supposed to arise from wrant of skill in the operator; by others it has been sup- posed to arise from the wounding of a nerve ; and again it lias been laid to the charge of a bad constitution. But if wre consider more critically this consequence arising from bleed- ing, we shall find that it happens frequently after bleeding in veins where no tendon could possibly be wounded, and also where no particular nerve could be in the way. It seems likewise to happen as frequently in con- stitutions where there is no appearance of want of health, as in those dis- posed to disease. As a proof of this last, upon bleeding in another vein in the same person, perhaps with a view to assist in the cure of the in- flammation arising from the first bleeding, the wound has healed very readily. If we examine the proportion which the number of those inflamma- tions that happen after bleeding bears to those which arise from as slight a wound where no large vein has been injured, and even perhaps where the wound has not been made by so clean a cutting instrument, and the same pains not taken to close it up, we shall find that those from wounded veins are much the most frequent, and that such inflammations seldom or ever happen under the last-mentioned circumstances: therefore we must look for some other cause to explain this effect of bleeding. The manner in which those sore arms come on shows plainly that thev arise from the wound not healing by the first intention : for the external wound in most cases first festers or inflames, then suppurates and ulce- rates, so that the cavity of the vein becomes impervious. In some this suppuration is only superficial, the vein and parts below' having united. In others the skin shall appear to be united, but not close to the vein, so that a small abscess shall form between the skin and the vein ; it shall burst and discharge a thin watery fluid, and no further mischief happen ; but when this imperfection of union is continued on to the cavity of the vein, then the vein inflames both upwards and downwards, and that often for a considerable way, and the surrounding parts join in the in- flammation. We find all these variations in different cases: for the disease some- times goes no further than an inflammation in the vein near to the orifice, which is often resolved ; at other times the inflammation is carried fur- ther, but suppuration is prevented by the adhesive inflammation taking place in the vein at this part, so as to exclude the suppurative inflam- mation, and the veins in such cases may be plainly felt, after the sur-

OF THE SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION. 411 where the first cause wa3 a destruction of the natural functions, as an exposure of internal surfaces, that they form a disposition to the second method of cure. That the disposition for suppuration is very different from the actual state of inflammation, though produced by it, is proved by a variety of observations, for no perfect suppuration takes place till the inflammation is gone off; and as the inflammation ceases the dis- position to suppuration gradually comes on. If, too, by any peculiarity in the constitution, or inflammation by which it is continued, or if by any accident an inflammation is brought on a healthy sore, the discharge and other appearances become the same as they were when the part from whence they arose was first in an inflamed state, very different from those observed when it was arrived at the state of a kind of sup- puration. §.2. Of the Treatment necessary in Inflammation when Sup- puration must take place. In cases of inflammation arising from accident, but so circumstanced that we know suppuration cannot be prevented, the practice will be to moderate the inflammation if necessary, but not with a view to prevent suppuration; for if the powers are very great, and the violence committed very considerable, the inflammation will probably be very violent; and if it should have equal effects on the constitution, which will be in pro- portion to the quantity of surface inflamed, then certain constitutional means of relief will be necessary, such as bleeding, purging, regimen, and perhaps producing sickness; because, while that inflammation, continues to have effects upon the constitution, the suppuration which takes place will not be so kindly as it would otherwise be; but if the constitution is of the irritable kind, which will be generally known by the inflammation, the same practice as mentioned above is necessary; in short, whatever is to be the consequence, whether resolution or sup- puration, the irritability and the too great action of the vessels, whether arising from too great powers, or too great action with small powers, are to be corrected or removed, as they in all cases counteract salutary operations. In cases where the constitution has sympathized much with the in- flamed part, such medicines as produce a slight perspiration much re- lieve the patient, such as antimonials, Dover’s powder, saline draughts, spirits of mindererus, etc., because they endeavour to keep up a universal harmony, by putting the skin in good humour (which quiets every sym- pathizing part), and by counteracting the effects of the irritability.

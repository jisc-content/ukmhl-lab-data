i o GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE BLOOD. rr this conjecture is rendered more likely when we consider that in animals - which have no red globules of any kind respiration is as essential to their existence as in any other, and -we find that the blood may lose this effect and yet retain its salutary effects in the constitution. Thus, when any large artery is tied, the parts beyond must be supplied with blood that shall have lost its florid colour; and in the chick in the egg the blood in the arterial system is dark, while in the veins of the tem- porary lungs it is florid. We are led by daily experience to observe : that the dark blood taken from a vein becomes red on that surface - which is exposed to the common atmosphere, and that if it be shaken in a phial with air the whole becomes red*. If blood also be allowed to s stand exposed to the air and to coagulate, its upper surface will become . of the scarlet red, while the bottom remains dark, or even of a darker colour than common venal blood, because it contains a greater quantity of red globules. If the coagulated blood be inverted, and the bottom * This does not arise from motion, for fill the phial with blood without air, and put into it glass-beads, and shake them, so as to give it motion, the colour will not be i altered. while of three portions of blood taken from a slaughtered animal, the third is often ob- served to be slower in coagulating than the second: besides, “ Pithing, poisoning by prussic acid, and the injection of air into the veins, show as strongly as death from haemorrhage the last-drawn blood to concrete with greatest rapidity.” (Thackrah, p. 139.) I conceive, therefore, that these differences in the coagulating power of the blood may best be referred to the varying conditions of the vital powers. The following Table exhibits the differences of time in regard to the blood’s con- cretion : 1st Cup. 2nd Cup.

(Op. cit., p. 132.) Blood taken during the actual state of syncope rarely separates its serum, and in proportion as an animal approaches to this state, the separative change is less and less; thus, from a stuck calf the first portion of blood (which was taken on the infliction of the wound,) yielded 412-3 serum to 587*7 crassamentum, while in the second portion (which was taken when the haemorrhage had naarly ceased,) the proportions were a* 361*7 to 630-3.]

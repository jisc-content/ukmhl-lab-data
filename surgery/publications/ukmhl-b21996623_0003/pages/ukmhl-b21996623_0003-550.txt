THE TREATMENT OF ABSCESSES. 524 made the most defective at the mouth of the abscess, as that part is the easiest of management. To have this effect produced as much as pos- sible, abscesses should be allowed to go on till they break or open of themselves; for although abscesses in general only open by a small ori- fice, more especially when sound, yet it is to be remarked that the skin over the general cavity of the abscess is in such cases so much thinned as to have but very little disposition to heal, and is often so much so as to ulcerate and make a free opening; and if it does not, an opening is more easily procured by art. It is a curious circumstance in the ceconomy of abscesses that those that have the best dispositions to heal come fastest to the skin ; the lead takes place almost at a point, it does not swell so much into that coni- cal form above described, not being under the same necessity in point of healing, and it opens by a small orifice; while, on the other hand, if there is an indolence in the progress of the abscess it will spread more, or distend the surrounding parts, from their not being so firmly united by inflammation in the one as they were in the other; nor will ulcera- tion so readily take the lead, and it will come to the skin by a broad surface, so as to thin a large portion of the skin. But abscesses should only be allowed to open of themselves where the confinement of the matter can do no mischief, which will generally be in such as ought to heal up from the bottom; but in the reduction of circumscribed cavi- ties to the state of an abscess it will be in most cases proper to open early, as in abscesses of the abdomen or thorax, those within the cra- nium, those of the eye, and those in joints. In the abscess of the tunica vaginalis testis it would be better to let it open of itself, as it should be allowed to heal up from the bottom, similar to an abscess in the cellular membrane. If it should be unnecessary to open freely, or if from circumstances this should be impossible, it will in either case be very proper to make the opening which is necessary or practicable at the most depending part, with a view to remove the pressure arising from the matter col- lected, which is commonly called confinement or lodgement of matter, which will otherwise happen ; for I shall observe that a very small pres- sure on that side of the abscess next to the skin may produce ulceration there; and although this pressure in many cases might not be so great as to produce ulceration at the bottom of the abscess, yet it may be so great as to prevent granulations from forming on that side, and thereby retard the cure, as no union can take place but by means of granula- tions ; or if it should not prevent granulations from forming, yet it might retard their growth, so that the cure would be more tedious than if the pressure did not exist; and this retardation will be greatest where the

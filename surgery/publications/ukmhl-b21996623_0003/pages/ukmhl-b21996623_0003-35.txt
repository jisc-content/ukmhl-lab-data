9 INTRODUCTION. Upon the principles here laid down, the bark is the principal medi- cine as yet known that we depend upon, as it increases the powers and lessens the degree of action. Upon many occasions opium will be of singular service by lessening the action, although it does not give real strength. I have seen good effects from it, both when given internally in large doses, and when applied to the part. It is proper also to keep the parts cool, and all the applications should be colda. a [Notwithstanding the condemnation which is here pronounced on scarifications and warm dressings, yet experience and theory both tend to confirm the utility of this mode of treatment. The former, or scarifications, afford an exit to putrid matters, while the latter by their antiseptic qualities diminish the quantity which is produced, and at the same time modify its virulence. But it is not merely the constitutional effects which are lessened by these means. There cannot be the slightest question that the local effects are equally mitigated, and the pernicious consequences of sloughs and ill-con- ditioned pus in contact with the living textures materially lessened, by providing a free escape for these matters. This subject will be adverted to more fully when speaking of “ diffuse cellular inflammation,” in which the bad effects of putrid secretions in con- tact with the living solids are most conspicuously shown. In regard to the advantages of bark, I need not here observe that its pretensions in the present day as a medicine in cases of mortification are rated much more moderately than they were formerly. Practitioners no longer think that strength is imparted to the system in proportion to the quantity of bark which the patient is made to swallow.]

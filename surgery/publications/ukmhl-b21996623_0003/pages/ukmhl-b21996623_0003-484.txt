OF PUS. 458 does not hesitate to ascribe the origin of parasitic acephalocysts and entozoa to this source (op. cit. p. 377 ft seq.). These speculations, however, are scarcely admissible iu the present state of science. The only thing which we are able to say with any cer- tainty on this subject is, that these depositions are usually found to coexist with suppu- rations in other parts of the system, and therefore may with more probability be ascribed to the resorption of matter.] *

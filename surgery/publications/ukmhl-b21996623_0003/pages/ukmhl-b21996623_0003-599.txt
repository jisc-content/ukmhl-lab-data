OF THE TREATMENT OF GUN-SIIOT WOUNDS. o/3 r* Py r> not to be in the power of surgery to save, I will not now determine. I his is a very different case from the former, and its consequences de- pend more upon contingencies, so that the part should be removed only when the state of the patient in other respects will admit of it; hut this is seldom the case, for few people in full health are in that s’tate, and still less so those who are usually the subjects of gun-shot wounds • the situation they are in at the time, from the hurry of mind, makes it here in general to be the very worst practice ; it will in general there- fore, he much better to wait till the inflammation, and all the effects of both the irritation and inflammation, shall be gone off. If these things are not sufficiently attended to, and the first inflam- mation, as in the first-stated case, (for instance, that which is likely to prove mortal.) is allowed to go on, the patient will most probably lose Jus life ; or if the first inflammation is such as is likely to go off, accord- ing to the last-stated case, then we should allow it to go off before we operate and not run the risk of producing death by an operation; for I have already observed, few can support the consequences of the loss of a lower extremity when in full health and vigour. We know that a violent inflammation will in a few hours alter the healthy disposition and give a turn to the constitution, especially if a considerable quantity of blood has been lost, which most probably will be the case where both accident and operation immediately succeed one another. The patient under such circumstances becomes low, simply by the animal life losinc its powers, and hardly ever recovers afterwards. After considering the curative treatment of gun-shot wounds and other accidents common to the soldier as also the sailor, let us further consider the treatment of those patients whose wounds at the very first removed° ^ inCUrable When they are in I)arts that will admit of being iects of°Peraiti0a itSelf, ^ thC Same aS in °ther Cases> the only sub- jects of peculiar consideration here are the situation of the patient and the proper time for performing the operation after the injury I have already given some directions with regard to the proper time of operating in treating upon the dilatation of gun-shot woinds which ar m some degree applicable here ; but we shall consider this now more “ “ “"■* • •“ •—-» A, these injuries in the soldier are generally received at a distance from all care except,ng what may he called chirergical, it is proper we should consider how far the one should be practised without the other.

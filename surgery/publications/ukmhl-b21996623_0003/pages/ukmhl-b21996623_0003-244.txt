OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 218 The continual repetition of the cause of this serpentine course obliges the arteries in many places to retain this state, especially in parts that do not yield readily, as the skull, upon which the temporal artery is placed; and this retention of the serpentine course is still more obvious in those arteries which have lost a good deal of their elasticity. However, this increase8 of the artery is so manifest as to be felt or seen, and pro- duces what is called the pulse, which must gradually diminish in propor- tion as the arteries divide into smaller branches; for a small artery hav- ing a proportional pulse, and the arterial system increasing as it goes along, both of which causes diminish the velocity of the blood, and render the diastole less and its motions more uniform. From the description I have given of the heart with its action, and the parts of which an artery is composed, it must appear that an artery is at all times full of blood, which is moving on with more or less velocity; because it receives it from the heart at interrupted periods, and when a given quantity is thrown in at one end, this will make a considerable difference between this part and the other, which part will of course be more upon the stretch ; for although the artery dilates, yet as it is from the impulse of the blood, the blood must move much faster on in the diastole of the artery than its systole. This part of the artery w ill contract, and throw the blood into the remaining part; but not w'ith the same force with which it wras received; but still the artery beyond will receive it faster than it wTill give it. By these means, all the parts that most organs which perform or are liable to be called upon suddenly to perform any extraordinary degree of action, as the uterus, brain, testicles, &c., are provided with highly tortuous vessels, he argues that this arrangement must be designed to give greater power to the local circulation, so as to increase the velocity of the blood in those parts, as occasion may require, without necessarily engaging the whole vascular system in this act; and this is supposed to be accomplished by the increased muscular superficies giving greater strength to the tortuous artery. We cannot, however, argue from final causes in such cases as this; neither can we at present, with any degree of precision, say how far the muscularity of the arteries is actually concerned in carrying on the ordinary circulation. We do, however, know, on physical principles, that the multiplication of angles, and the increased superficies of a tortuous vessel, must have the effect of retard- ing the current which passes through it; while, on the other hand, we know that the mere force of impulsion from behind is sufficient to produce a tortuosity of the vessel, as well of the arteries and veins as of inert tubes; but as it is not pretended that the veins assist the circulation by their muscularity, the tortuosity in them can neither arise from the cause assigned, nor be attended with the effect supposed. It is probable, therefore, that the tortuosity is produced by the same cause in both orders of vessels, and that it is attended with the same effect.] • [Does the author mean by “this increase,” the elongation or the diametrical en- largement of the artery ? The preceding part of the paragraph would seem to point to the former meaning; but in the first paragraph of this section he says, “ It is the increased diameter which becomes sensible to the touch.”]

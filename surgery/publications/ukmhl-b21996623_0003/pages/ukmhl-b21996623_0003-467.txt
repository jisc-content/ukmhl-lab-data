441 OF PUS. the very parts which produced it, and which it is meant to heal. Pro- bably they took their idea from finding that an abscess was a hollow cavity in the solids, and supposing the whole of the original substance ot this cavity was now the matter which was found in it. This was a very natural way of accounting for the formation of pus by one entirely ignorant of the moviug juices, the powers of the arteries, and the operation of an abscess after it was opened ; for the knowledge of these three, abstracted from the knowledge of the abscess before opening, should have naturally led them to account for the formation of pus from the blood by the powers of the arteries alone, for upon their principle these abscesses should continue to increase after opening as fast as be- fore. Upon this principle being established in their minds, viz. that solids were dissolved down into pus, they built a practice which was to bring all indurated parts to suppuration if possible, and not to open the suppuration in such parts early ; this was done with a view to give such solids time to melt down into pus, which was the expression; but ac- cording to their own theory, they seemed to forget that abscesses formed matter after opening, and therefore the parts stood the same chance of dissolution into pus as before. Also, from being possessed of this idea, that solids went into the composition of pus, they never saw' pus flowing from any internal canal, as in a gonorrhoea, etc., but they concluded that there was an ulcer; we would forgive such opinions before the knowledge that such surfaces could and generally did form pus without a breach of the solids; but that such an opinion should exist afterwards, is not mere ignorance, but stupidity; and the very circumstance of in- ternal circumscribed cavities, as the abdomen, thorax, etc., forming pus, where they might often have seen pints of matter, and yet no breach in the solids to have produced it, which is a proof beyond controversy, should have taught them better; such ideas discover defect of knowledge and incapacity for observation. 1 he moderns have been still more ridiculous; for knowing that it w'as denied that solids were ever dissolved into pus, and also knowing that there was not a single proof of it, they have been busy in producing w hat to them seemed proof. They have been putting dead animal mat- ter mto abscesses, and finding that it was either wholly or in part dis- solved, they therefore attributed the loss to its being formed into pus; but this was putting living and dead animal matter upon the same foot- ing, which is a contradiction in itself: for if the result of this experiment w as really according to their idea of it, the idea of living parts being dissolved into pus must fall to the ground, because living animal matter and dead animal matter can never stand upon the same ground. Common observation in their profession should have taught them that

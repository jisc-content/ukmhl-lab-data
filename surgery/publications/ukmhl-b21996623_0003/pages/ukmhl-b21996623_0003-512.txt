486 THE ULCERATIVE INFLAMMATION. in general the cuticle is so thin as to give but very little trouble*: how- ever, in many places it is so thick as to be the cause of very trouble- some consequences. Thus far I have considered ulceration as arising from visible irrita- tions, joined with a susceptibility of the parts for such particular irri- tation ; but besides those above described, we often have instances of ulceration taking place from a disposition in a part, and where perhaps no reason can be assigned but weakness in the part. I observed before, that some parts of the body were more susceptible of ulceration than others. I then spoke of original parts; but I now remark that newly- formed parts are much more susceptible of ulceration than the original; such as cicatrices, granulations, calluses, etc., for we find this disposition often taking place in old cicatrices from very slight causes, such as ir- regularity in the way of life or violent exercise, which is seen every day in our hospitals, where the parts seem incapable of supporting them- * This is the reason why many abscesses in the palms of the hands, soles of the feel, fore part of the fingers, and about the nails, commonly called whitloes, &c., more espe- cially in working people, give so much pain.in the time of inflammation, and are so long in breaking, even after the matter has got through the cutis to the cuticle; the thick- ness of the cuticle, as also the rigidity of the nail, acting in those cases like a tight ban- dage, which does not allow them to swell or give way to the extravasation; for in the cuticle there is not the relaxing power, which adds considerably to the pain arising from the inflammation; hut when the abscess has reached to this thick cuticle it has no power of irritation, and therefore acts only by distention; and this is in most cases so consi- derable, as to produce a separation of the cuticle from the cutis for a considerable way round the abscess ; for I observed, when on inflammation, that it commonly produced a separation of the cuticle ; all of which circumstances taken together, make these com- plaints much more painful than a similar-sized abscess in any other soft part. The ap- plication of poultices in these cases is of more benefit than in any other, because here they can act mechanically, viz. the moisture being imbibed by the cuticle, as in a sponge, and thereby softening the cuticle, by which means it becomes larger in its dimensions and less durable in its texture. These cases should be opened as soon as possible, to avoid the pain arising from distention and the separation of the cuticle; when it is conceived it means to point at any one part, paring off the thick cuticle near the cutis, allows tile matter to make its escape more readily, when it has got through the cutis. There is a circumstance which almost always attends the opening such an ab- scess, viz. the soft parts underneath pusli out through the opening in the cuticle, like a fungus, which when irritated from any accident, gives a greater idea of soreness perhaps than any other morbid part of the machine ever does: this is owing to the sur- rounding belts of cuticle not having given way to the increase of the parts underneath, by which means they are squeezed out of this small opening, like paint out of a bladder. It is a common practice to eat this down by escharotics, as if it was a diseased fungus ; but this additional pain is very unnecessary, as the destroying a part which has only escaped from pressure, cannot in the least affect that which is within: and by simply poulticing till the inflammation, and of course the tumefaction, subside, these protruded parts are gradually drawn into their original situations.

THE ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. 402 lived but a few days in this way, during which time the cellular mem- brane was hanging out of the wounds like wet dirty tow. The adhesive inflammation takes place in consequence of accidents, (when it is impossible it should ever produce the same good effects,) such as wounds which are not allowed to or cannot heal by the first in- tention ; for instance, a stump after amputation, and many other wounds: but it is one of those fixed and invariable principles of the animal machine, which upon all such irritations uniformly produces the uniting process, though, like many other principles in the same machine, the effects [which it produces] are perhaps not so much required; so that although a wound is not allowed to heal, or cannot heal by means of the adhe- sive inflammation, yet the surrounding parts go through the common consequences of being wounded, and the surrounding cells are united; as was described when I treated of union by the first intention. It first throws out the blood, as if the intention was to unite the parts again; the newly-cut or tom ends of the vessels, however, soon contract and close up, and then the discharge is not blood, but a serum with the co- agulating part of the blood, similar to that which is produced by the adhesive state of inflammation, so that they go through the two first processes of union ; therefore the use of the adhesive inflammation does not appear so evidently in these cases as in spontaneous inflammations : however, in case of wounds which are allowed to suppurate, it answers the great purpose of uniting the cells at the cut surface, from their being simply in contact with each other, as has been described, which confines the inflammation to that part, without which the irritation arising from this state of imperfection might have been communicated from cell to cell, and proceed further than it commonly does. The cut vessels, by this means, are also united, which hinders the progress of inflammation from running along their cavities, as we find sometimes to be the case in the veins of a wounded surface, where this inflammation has not taken place. From everything which has been said it must appear that all sur- faces, which are suppurating in consequence of this inflammation, have their basis in that state of the adhesive inflammation which very nearly approaches to suppuration; and this inflammation is less and less as it recedes further from the suppurating centre.

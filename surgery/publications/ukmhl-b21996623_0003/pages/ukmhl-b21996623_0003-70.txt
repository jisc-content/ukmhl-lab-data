44 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TIIE BLOOD. always found when the blood is taken out of the blood-vessels, and kept together in a considerable mass. When the lymph coagulates strongly. 1st, In individuals of dif- ferent ages and sexes. 2nd, In individuals of the same sex but of dif- ferent ages.

Age (within the period of twenty to sixty years) does not seem to make much difference. The proportion of nutritive matters in the sanguine is about 1 per cent, more in the female, and 1§ per cent., more in the male, than in those who are lymphatic. Venesection and considerable haemorrhages have a marked effect in impoverishing the blood of its nutritive parts. Thus the blood of a patient who had been subject to copious uterine haemorrhages (pertes uterines) yielded only 137-120 parts, or nearly 5 per cent, less than the usual average, while the blood of another patient was impoverished as much as 4 per cent, after a single venesection. These facts accord with experience, and afford a rational account of the advantages of depletion in cases of over- excitement. The principal change in the blood in cholera consists in the great relative increase of the solid parts and deficiency in the carbonated alkalies, the fibrin, albu- men, and colouring matter not undergoing any changes which can be detected by chemical analysis. Thus the average of the following analyses shows an extraordinary increase of the solid contents in choleric blood: f 66-01 f 34 Water....■< 74-9 > solid contents < 25 L 481 J L 52 Average 63-0 -j- 37 = 100. Amounting to little less than double the ordinary quantity. From other observations it would appear that acute diseases generally tend to increase, and chronic ones to di- minish, the nutritive parts of the blood. Thackrah has related a case of pleurisy in which the proportion of serum to crassamentum was as 10- to 54'9 (op.cit., p. 197.); and according to Langrish the relative quantities of serum to crassamentum in acute fevers, tertians, and quartans, were respectively as 10 to 33, 10 to 25, and 10 to 16. Of sixteen cases of acute disease taken indiscriminately from ordinary practice, only one fell below the ordinary standard, while the average of solid contents for 12 out of the 16 was 207"9 in 1000, the healthy standard being estimated at 160. ( Thackrah, p. 208.) The blood is proportionally more rich in those who have long fasted than in those who have recently eaten; in wild and predatory animals, in persons who subsist on rich animal diet, and in females during the period of utcro-gcstation. Sickness, syncopc( salivation, insufficient nutriment, and, above all, hemorrhage, impoverish the blood. The blood of a calf which was killed 16 hours after a copious venesection and subsequent

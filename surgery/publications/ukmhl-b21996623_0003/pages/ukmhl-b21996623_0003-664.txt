SIR E. home’s OBSERVATIONS, ETC. 633 These incysted tumours, when considered as varieties of the same dis- ease, form a very complete and beautiful series of the different modes by which the powers of the animal ceconomy produce a substitute for the common cuticle upon parts which have been so much affected by disease as to be unable to restore themselves to a natural state. will be readily understood, the destruction of the cyst being all that is required for that purpose. This may be done before the tumour opens externally, or even after the ex- crescence has begun to shoot out, and will be better effected by dissection than escha- rotics, since the success of the operation depends upon the whole of the bag being re- moved. ° 6 END OF THE THIRD VOLUME.

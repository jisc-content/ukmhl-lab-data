OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 233 the parenchyma of many animals and vegetables where no vessels exist. 3. A similar phenomenon is observed in the first days of embryonic life, the vessels being a result or consequence of these motions; and, lastly, the globules possess an inherent power of self-motion (see notes, pp. 63. 131), in virtue of which they move in determinate direc- tions, agglomerate together in piles or rouleaux, traverse the substance of recently de- posited lymph, ascend against the force of gravity when effused on the surfaces of living membranes, escape from the blood-vessels into the parenchyma of the surrounding tex- tures, &c. &c. (Haller, Dollinger, Gendrin, Rayer-Collurd, Kaltenbrvnner, and Mar- shall Hall.) These attractions and repulsions are supposed by some to resemble the attractions and repulsions of similar particles united so as to compose muscular fibre, and by others to depend on the different electrical relations induced by respiration and nutrition altering the chemical constitution of the blood. Thus, according to this prin- ciple, attraction is supposed to draw the blood to a part being in action, and repulsion to drive it from it, and this in exact proportion to the energy of the action going on in that part; so that instead of the increased circulation being, as is commonly supposed, the cause of the increased action, the very reverse is the case. The vital action induced in a branch of a tree exclusively exposed to the sun, is the cause and not the effect of an increased flow of sap into it. (See Alison’s Physiology, p. 32, and Supp., p. 25.) 9. Endosmose and Exosmose.—Attempts have been made to refer the circulation of the blood to these sources, but it is difficult to conceive how such causes can give a de- terminate direction to the circulating fluids, or how the circulation thus carried on can be affected by physiological causes.

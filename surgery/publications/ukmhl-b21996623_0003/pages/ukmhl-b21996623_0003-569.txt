OF GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 543 sometimes pieces of broken shells, and very often, on board of ship, splinters of wood. Indeed, the effects of cannon-balls on different parts of the ship, either the containing parts, as the hull of the ship itself, or the contained, are the principal causes of wounds in the sailor; for a cannon-ball must go through the timbers of the ship before it can do more execution than simply as a ball, (which makes it a -spent ball,) and which splinters the inside of the ship very considerably, and moves other bodies in the ship, neither of which it would do if moving with sufficient velocity; musket- or cannon-balls seldom doing immediate injury to those of that profession. The wounds produced by the three last bodies will be more like many common and violent accidents, at- tended with much contusion and laceration of parts. Gun-shot wounds, from whatever cause, whether from a musket-ball, canuon-ball, shell, etc., are in general contused wounds, from which contusion there is most Commonly a part of the solids surrounding the wound deadened, as the projecting body forced its way through these solids, which is afterwards thrown off" in form of a slough, and which prevents such wounds from healing by the first intention, or by means of the adhesive inflammation, from which circumstance most of them must be allowed to suppurate. This does not always take place equally in every gun-shot wound, nor in every part of the same wound ; and the difference commonly arises from the variety in the velocity of the body projected; tor we find in many cases where the ball has passed with little velocity, which is often the case with balls even at their en- trance, but most commonly at the part last wounded by the ball, that the wounds are often healed by the first intention. Gun-shot wounds, from the circumstance of commonly having a part killed, in general do not inflame so readily as those from other acci- dents : this backwardness to inflame will be in the proportion that the quantity of deadened parts bears to the extent of the wound ; from which circumstance the inflammation is later in coming on, more espe- cially when a ball passes through a fleshy part with great velocity, be- cause there will be a great deal deadened, in proportion to the size of the wound : therefore inflammation in gun-shot wounds is less than in wounds in general, where the same quantity of mischief has been done ; and this also is in an inverse proportion to the quantity of the parts deadened, as 1 have already explained in my introduction to inflamma- tion, ' iz. that inflammation is less where parts are to slough than where parts have been destroyed by other means. On the other hand, where the ball has fractured some bone, which fracture in the bone has done considerable mischief to the soft parts, independently of the ball, then

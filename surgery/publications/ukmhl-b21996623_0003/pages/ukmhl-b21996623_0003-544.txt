PART III. CHAPTER I. THE TREATMENT OF ABSCESSES. I HAVE endeavoured to lay down the general principles of suppura- tion, which principles of themselves lead to a general method of cure; but as it is only' the proper application of art to those principles which completes the surgeon, and since it is the most difficult part to apply our knowledge of first principles to practice with readiness, especially when there appear some peculiarities, it will be necessary' to bring the beginner from first principles to the practical part. Abscesses are in general consequences of spontaneous inflammation, but not always so; for they may be consequences of some violence, as strains or bruises from some external violence, which has hurt deeper- seated parts than the skin over them, which inflame and form an abscess, as was described in treating of accidents ; as also from the introduction of extraneous bodies, over which the parts have healed. Even when they appear to be spontaneous, they arise from so many' causes, and from thence have so many dispositions, or are of so many kinds, that in ge- neral they become one of the greatest objects in surgery ; because, from these circumstances, they require a vast variety in the manner of treat- ment. I do not mean at present to enter into a full discussion of the cause, effect, and cure of every abscess, because that would be treating of every' disease which is capable of producing such complaints, many of which would come under the article of specific diseases, which must be treated of separately; yet I mean here to lay down such general surgical rules for their treatment and many of their consequences, as will include almost everyâ€™ kind of disease of this kind, considered as an abscess simply'. So that the specific treatment of any specific abscess will be principally con- fined to the medicinal treatment of the part and the constitution ; there- by the treatment of the local complaint so produced, abstracted from the specific disposition, will for the most part come under our general rules. As most spontaneous suppurations, from whatever cause, arc deeper-

41G OF THE SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION. any of the above-mentioned operations ; for the skin, after amputation, is drawn down and bound down, and the wounds are pressed together by bandages. In one point of view this is beginning too early; it is beginning it when Nature has the very opposite principle in view : in- flammation the parts must submit to, and as inflammation by its effects will generally have a tendency to make them recede more, in this light it is proper not to check the effects of inflammation; therefore let them take their own way till inflammation subsides and granulations are formed, which granulations, I have already observed, by their power of contraction, will do what we wanted to have done ; and if, from some of the first circumstances not being properly attended to, the contrac- tion of the granulations is not sufficient, then is the time to assist, and not before. However, if we take up this in another point of view, we shall see a considerable utility arising from bringing the skin as much as possible over the wound, and keeping it there; for in the time of in- flammation the parts will adhere or unite in this situation, by which means the sore will be less than it otherwise would; and I conceive that this practice, when begun, should be for some time continued, for fear the adhesions may not be sufficient to stand their ground till the gra- nulations can assist. It often happens in many wounds, both from accident and operations, that part of the wound may with great propriety be healed by the first intention; such as in many accidents on the head, when a part of the scalp has been torn off, on the face, &c., as also after many operations, especially where the skin is loose, as in the scrotum; or where the skin has been attended to in the time of the operation, as in some methods of amputation, extirpation of breasts, &c., a part of the saved skin, &c. may be made to unite to the parts underneath by the first intention, and therefore only part of the wound be allowed to suppurate. In all such cases a proper contracting or sustaining bandage may be applied with great advantage; even stitches may be used with great propriety, as was recommended in the healing of wounds by the first intention. ยง.3. The Treatment of the Inflammation when Suppuration has taken place. In spontaneous inflammations, whether from a constitutional or local affection, when suppuration has taken place, it is most probable that another mode of practice must be followed than that which was pursued to prevent it; but even now, if a stop could be put to the further forma- tion of matter, after it has begun, it would in many cases be very proper,

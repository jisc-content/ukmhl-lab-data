43() OF THE SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION. off from the sympathy of the constitution with the local disease, yet it lessens the momentum in the whole and in the part, which is taking off the effect of the excess of motion in the blood. The second is by di- minishing the action of the parts by affecting the constitution, which may be done by purging; in this light bleeding may also be in some degree considered. It becomes in such cases very necessary to relieve the constitution by lessening the action of that constitution ; for although what has been advised w'as to lessen the inflammation itself, and thereby lessen its effects on the constitution, yet as that seldom is done suffi- ciently to remove any affection of the constitution, wre must therefore pay attention to that constitution ; the two remedies will in some degree go hand in hand, one assisting the other; for instance, in a strong healthy constitution, where the symptomatic fever runs high, bleeding and purging will have their double effects ; but still the constitution may require its peculiar medicines, which will in a secondary way relieve the inflammation. The secondary constitutional symptoms are not so determined as to time ; I have called them nervous, although not strictly so in every case, because more variety of affections are produced than from any cause I know; yet these affections seem all to have more connexion with the nervous than the vascular system, and are severally excited by the par- ticular tendency or susceptibility of different constitutions. Many of them, I believe, are more common to the young than the old, which come under the doctrine of universal nervous sympathy with a local complaint; of this kind are universal convulsions from teething or worms, local convulsions, as St. Vitus's dance, and probably many others not so well marked, as those which worms and teething often produce. I have seen hiccup come on early in consequence of an operation ; but in this stage of the nervous affection little was to be apprehended, although it certainly showed a peculiarity of constitution, and such as should be attended to; but when hiccup occurs towards the last stages, it shows strong signs of dissolution. Many full-grown persons are also subject to very severe affections of the nervous kind, especially those people who are called nervous; and ■more particularly still those who have bad affections in consequence of complaints of the stomach. In such constitutions there is observed great dejection, sinking, cold sweats, hardly any pulse, loss of appetite, no Bleep, etc., seeming to threaten dissolution; and those symptoms are wor«e by fits Delirium appears to arise from nervous affection of the brain or sensorium, producing a sympathy of the action of the brain with the materia vitm of the parts; not sensation as a liead-ache but action producing ideas without the exciting impression, and therefore

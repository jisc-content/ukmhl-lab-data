487 THE ULCERATIVE INFLAMMATION. selves. Remarkable instances of this are recorded in Anson’s Voyages, where the habit was so much debilitated as to allow all the old sores to ulcerate, or break out anew: the calluses were absorbed and taken into the circulation ; and we also find that all these parts perform the operation of sloughing when dead, much sooner than original parts. Now it is evident, in those cases mentioned in Anson’s Voyages, that the whole frame of body was weakened by the hardships suffered in this expedition; and that the young or new-formed substances would suffer in a greater degree, arising from their being less firm and fixed than that which had been an original formation, and subsisted from the first; and as no repaired parts are endowed with the powers of action or re- sistance equal to an original part, it is no wonder that this new flesh, sharing in the general debility, became incapable of supporting its texture: perhaps a very sense of this debility proved an irritation, or the cause of that irritation which produced the absorption of parts; how- ever that may be, it is a general fact that parts which are not origi- nally formed, commonly give way soonest in depravations of the habit: in like circumstances also old sores that are healing, will break out, spread, and undo, in twenty-four hours, as much of the parts as had been healing in so many weeks. All these observations tend to prove that new-formed parts are not able to resist the power of many diseases, and to support themselves under so many shocks, as parts originally formed; which will be still further illustrated in treating of the power of absorption. I observed that, although a part is losing ground or ulcerating, yet it continues suppurating; for while a matter-forming surface is ulcerating, (whether an original-formed part of the body, such as most abscesses, or a new-formed substance, such as granulations,) we find that it still secretes pus. In such cases the adhesive inflammation proceeds very ra- pidly, and would seem to prepare the parts as it goes.for immediate suppuration, the moment they are exposed.

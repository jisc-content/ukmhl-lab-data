4G6 TIIE ULCERATIVE INFLAMMATION. When the immediate causes arise in consequence of pressure, it would appear that absorption takes place more readily under certain circum- tances than others, although the remote causes of them appear to be the same, and therefore there is something more than simple pres- sure. For we find that pressure from within produces ulceration or absorption much more readily than from without, for if it was pressure only, absorption then would be according to the quantity of pressure; but we find very different effects from the same quantity of pressure under the above-mentioned circumstances : for when from without, pres- sure rather stimulates than irritates, it shall give signs of strength, and produce an increase of thickening; but when from within, the same quantity of pressure will produce waste, for the first effect of the pres- sure from without is the disposition to thicken, which is rather an operation of strength ; but if it exceeds the stimulus of thickening then the pressure becomes an irritator, and the power appears to give way to it, and absorption of the parts pressed takes place, so that Nature very readily takes on those steps which are to get rid of an extraneous body, but appears not only not ready to let extraneous bodies enter the body, but endeavours to exclude them, by increasing the thickness of the parts. Many parts of our solids are more susceptible of being absorbed, espe- cially by ulceration, than others, even under the same or similar circum- stances, while the same part shall vary its susceptibility according to circumstances. The cellular and adipose membranes are very particularly susceptible of being absorbed, which is proved by muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and blood-vessels being found frequently deprived of their con- necting membrane and fat, especially in abscesses, so that ulceration often takes a roundabout course to get to the skin, following the track of the cellular membrane ; and the skin itself, when the pressure is from within, is much less susceptible of ulceration than the cellular and adi- pose membrane, which retards the progress of abscesses when they are so far advanced, and also becomes the cause of the skin s hanging over spreading ulcers, which are spreading from the same cause, more espe- cially too if the part ulcerating is an original part. Ulceration never takes place on investing membranes of circumscribed cavities, excepting suppuration has taken place ; and indeed ulceration in such parts would be a sure forerunner of suppuration. New-formed parts, or such as cannot be said to constitute part of the original animal, as healed sores, calluses of bones, especially those in consequence of compound fractures, admit more readily of absorption, especially the progressive, than those parts which were originally formed.

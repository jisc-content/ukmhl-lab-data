CONSEQUENCES ON THE CONSTITUTION. 515 cutting for the stone in very fat men, above the middle age, and who have lived well. The first symptoms are generally those of the stomach, which produce shivering; vomiting immediately follows, if not an immediate attendant; there is great oppression and anxiety, the persons conceiving they must die; there is a small quick pulse; perhaps bleeding from the whole sur- face of the sore; often mortification, with every sign of dissolution in the countenance; and, as it arises with the symptoms of death, its ter- mination is pretty quick. Here is a very fatal disease taking place, in some almost immediately, when all appeared to be within the power of the machine, and therefore cannot immediately arise from the sore itself, or it is very common after such operations as usually do well; but the hectic always takes place in consequence of those sores which seldom or never get well m any case; yet the sore certainly assists in bringing; on dissolution, because we never see the disease take place when the sore is healed, nor in those where the constitution seems not to be equal to the task, as is the cause of the hectic. The hectic is much slower in its progress, and seems to be a simple and an immediate effect, arising from a continued cause which is local • by removing the cause therefore the effect ceases, and the havoc made upon the constitution is soon restored : persons therefore do much better m consequence of the hectic having in some degree taken place prior to the removal of the cause. But dissolution is a change of the constitu- tion m consequence of causes which now do not wholly exist, and in many cases it does not take place till the constitution appears to be ca- pable easily of performing all its functions, and a removal of the parts does not relieve, as in the hectic; for dissolution does not depend for its continuance upon the presence of the disease. Death or dissolution appears not to be going on equally fast in every vital part; for we shall have many people very near their termination yet some vital actions shall be good and tolerably strong; and if it is a visible action, and life depends much upon this action, the patients shall not appear to be so near their end as they really are. Thus I have «een dying people whose pulse was full and strong as usual on the day pre- vious to their death but it has sunk almost at once, and then become extremely quick, with a thrill. On such occasions it shall rise again making a strong effort, and after a short time a moisture shall probably come on the skin, which shall in this state of pulse be warm, but upon the sinking of the pulse shall become cold and clammy; breathing shall ecome very imperfect, almost like short catchings, and the person shall soon die. It would appear in many cases that disease has produced *2 l 2

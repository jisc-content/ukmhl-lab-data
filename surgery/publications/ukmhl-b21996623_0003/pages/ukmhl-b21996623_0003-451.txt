OF TIIE SUPPURATI VK INFLAMMATION. 425 kinds, the one which begins slowly and increases progressively, as in the venereal disease, and the sympathetic affections of course come on gradually; the other, where it begins at once with violence, and after- wards diminishes. The first of this last division we have nothing to do with at present; it is, therefore, the kind of constitution, the kind of parts, the diseases which commence with so much violence as to affect the constitution at once, with the constitutional effects arising from the local disease being incurable, that form our present subject. I shall observe here, that every disease, whether local or constitu- tional, that has the power of termination in itself, commonly has its re- gular progress and stated times of action ; in some, however, there are no changes in the modes of action, the disease coming on and dying away; but in others there are; and in those where changes take place there are stated periods for those changes, so as to render them regular. As regularity in the modes of action in disease is conducive to the ter- mination of that disease, it is a thing very much to be desired, for these changes are a cessation of the action, either temporary or permanent. As the constitution sympathizes with a local irritation, and as that sympathy is according to the constitution, to the violence of the irrita- tion, and to the nature of the parts irritated ; and as the symptoms of that sympathy must be similar to constitutional complaints that are commonly taking place; if the local complaint should not be known, then they will be taken for constitutional complaints wholly, and treated as such: but often, from their continuance, some local affection is sus- pected : local complaints, however, are commonly preceded or attended with some local symptom, either directly or indirectly, or with some collateral symptom or symptoms, so as to direct us to the cause. Local complaints attended with inflammations, the objects of surgery, are often attended with, or rather consequent upon, violence of some kind, such as the loss of a part, either fluid or solid, which the constitution feels, and which loss or violence adds to the constitutional affection. This will be according to the quantity of injury or loss of living matter, whether blood or some solid, the time in the operation, the state of the parts operated upon, and the nature of the part removed. I have seen a man die almost immediately upon the loss of a testicle : I have seen convulsions immediately attend the operation for the hydrocele, so that I have almost despaired of recovery: I have seen a most violent sym- pathetic fever, delirium, and death follow, in consequence of dividing parts in the leg, and searching after a bleeding artery. The loss of a limb above the knee is more than many can bear: the cutting for the stone, where it breaks, and may be an hour in extracting, is also more than many can bear; the parts being in such a diseased state as not to

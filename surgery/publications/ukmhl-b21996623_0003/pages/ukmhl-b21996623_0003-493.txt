Ulceration in consequence of death in an external part takes place soonest on the external edge between the dead and the living.

But as some parts from their struc- ture are more susceptible of this irritation than others, we find that parts composed of such structure are often absorbed, although they are not in the shortest road to the skin : this structure is the cel- lular membrane, as will be taken notice of hereafter We find the same principle in the progress of tumours; for although absorption 3v7k & PreSSed' yet the interstitiai absorption only takes place on that side next the external surface, by which means the tumour is, as it were, led to the skin.

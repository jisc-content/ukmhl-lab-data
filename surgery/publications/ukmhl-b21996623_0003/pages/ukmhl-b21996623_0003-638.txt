612 ON THE CURE OF THE POPLITEAL ANEURISM. ficulty occurred, on account of the tumefaction of all the parts, affected by their vicinity to the aneurism, and from the imperceptibility of pul- sation in the artery till it was actually laid bare: however, having dis- covered it in its usual situation near the bone, and in its natural undi- lated state, I passed a ligature round it, about two inches above the tu- mour. I now again examined, and being convinced that the artery was included alone in the ligature, 1 gradually made it tight, till I felt a pulsation above-it, and none below, when I desisted, concluding that any pressure beyond this degree would be useless and dangerous. “ I will just observe here, that I found the common aneurismal needle with a handle very inconvenient, and would recommend in this case, where the artery lies so deep, a blunt semicircular needle, with the eye about half an inch from the end, without any handle. “ The wound was closed in the usual manner, and the edges brought together by sutures. On the following day the man was free from pain, the tumour much less tense or hard, and the whole leg greatly unloaded. No perceptible alteration in the heat of the limb could be remarked; when the current of blood was obstructed in the superficial veins by pressure, on its removal they immediately again became turgid, and in short every appearance indicated a continuance of perfect circu- lation. “ On the fifteenth day succeeding the operation the ligature came away, the limb was soft and unloaded, and the incision nearly healed; at the distance of six weeks there remains a small tumour, with some perceptible fluctuation. The patient cannot perfectly extend his leg, but is able to walk with the assistance of crutches.”

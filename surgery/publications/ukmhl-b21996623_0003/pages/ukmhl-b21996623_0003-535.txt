CONSEQUENCES ON THE CONSTITUTION. 509 tion, and also in such parts as have naturally but little powers to heal; Mre must at the same time include parts that are well disposed to take on such specific diseases as are not readily cured in any situation ; such parts are principally the larger joints, both of the trunk and extremities; but in the small joints of the toes and fingers, although the same local effects take place as in the larger, yet the constitution is not made sen- sible of it; we therefore find a scrofulous joint of a toe or finger going on for years without affecting the constitution. The ankle, wrist, elbow, and even the shoulder may be affected much longer than either the knee, hip-joint or loins, before the constitution sympathizes with their want of powers to heal. Although the hectic commonly arises from some incurable local dis- ease of a vital part, or of a common part when of some magnitude, yet it is possible for it to be an original disease in the constitution ; the constitution Hi ay fall into the same mode of action, without any local cause whatever, at least that we know of. Hectic may be sa.id to be a slow mode of dissolution : the general symptoms are those of a low or slow fever, attended with weakness, but more with the action of weakness than real weakness; for upon the removal of the hectic cause, the action of strength is immediately produced, as well as every natural function, however much it was de- creased before. The particular symptoms are debility; a small, quick, and sharp pulse; the blood forsaking the skin; loss of appetite; often re- jection of all aliment by the stomach; wasting; a great readiness to be thrown into sweats; sweating spontaneously when in bed ; frequently a constitutional purging; the wrater clear. This disease has been and is still in general laid to the charge of the absorption of pus into the constitution from a sore; but I have long imagined that an absorption of pus has been too much blamed as the cause of many of the bad symptoms which frequently attack people who have sores. This symptom almost constantly attends suppuration when in particular parts, such as the vital parts, as well as many inflam- mations before actual suppuration has taken place, as in many of the larger joints, called white swellings; while the same kind and quantity of inflammation and suppuration in any of the fleshy parts, and espe- cially such of them as are near the source of the circulation, have in ge- neral no such effect; in those cases, therefore, it is only an effect upon the constitution produced by a local complaint, having a peculiar pro- perty, which I shall now consider. I observed, that with all diseases of vital parts, the constitution sym- pathized more readily than with diseases of any other parts; and also, that all diseases of vital parts are more difficult of cure in general than'

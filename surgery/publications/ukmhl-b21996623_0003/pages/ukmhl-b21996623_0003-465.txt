OF PUS. 439 CHAPTER V. OF PUS. Hitherto I have been treating of the operations of parts prepa- ratory to the formation of pus; I am now come to the formation of that fluid, its nature and supposed uses. T. he immediate effect of the mode of action above described is the for- mation of a fluid, commonly termed pus; this is very different from what was discharged in the time of the adhesive stage of the inflammation, when either formed in the cellular membrane or circumscribed cavities; it is also very different from the natural secretion of internal canals, though it is probably formed iu both by the same vessels, but under very different modes of action. The cellular membrane, or circumscribed cavities, have their vessels but little changed from the adhesive state at the commencement of the suppurative disposition, so that they still retain much of the form they had acquired by the first state, the discharge being at the beginning little more than coagulating lymph mixed with some serum. This is scarcely different from the adhesive stage of the inflammation ; but as the inflammatory disposition subsides, the new disposition is every in- stant of time altering those vessels to their suppurative state ; the dis- charge is also varying and changing from a species of extravasation to a new-formed matter peculiar to suppuration ; this matter is a remove further from the nature of the blood, and becomes more and more of the nature of the pus; it becomes whiter and whiter, losing more and more of the yellow and green, which it is apt to give the linen that is stained with it in its first stages, and in consistence more and more viscid or creamy. By the formation of this new substance, the coagulating lymph, which was extravasated in the adhesive state of the inflammation, and adhered to the sides of the cells, either in cut surfaces as in wounds, in abscesses, or circumscribed cavities, is pushed off from these surfaces ; and if it is the inner surface of a cavity, it is pushed into it, so that the cavity con- tains both coagulating lymph and pus; or if it is a cut surface, the co- agulating lymph is separated from it by the suppuration taking place, and is thrown ofl; but as such surfaces sire generally dressed immediately after the operation, while the wound is bleeding, this blood unites the

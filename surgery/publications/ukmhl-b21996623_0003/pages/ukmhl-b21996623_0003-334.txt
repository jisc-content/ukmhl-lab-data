308 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INFLAMMATION. added without altering the nature of the inflammation itself, and that they only determine its situation, extent, duration, &c. according to the specific disposition added, provided the constitution be healthy; hut if the constitution be unhealthy (whether affected with erysipelas, putrid fever, or plague), and the specific disease be superadded, it will be a mixture of both, that is, it will be a specific inflammation set down upon a constitution of a peculiar kind, and partaking of the character of both, and those specific properties will not be so distinct, or so well formed, as when they appear in a sound constitution. If the constitution has a susceptibility to he putrid, and the small- : pox attacks it, the inflammation will be the smallpox joined with the j putrid mode of action of the constitution, which will affect the mode of action peculiar to the smallpox, and destroy the specific difference of j the inflammation belonging to the smallpox : the pustules will spread, j not suppurate, and look livid according to the putrid disposition. These J constant effects, peculiar to the constitution, may be changed from the j one to the other just as the constitution changes, for the smallpox may j begin upon a healthy constitution, in which they will be distinct or circumscribed; but if the constitution becomes diseased, they will spread; and if the constitution takes a healthy turn again, they will begin to contract to their specific distance again*. * The knowledge of these facts is of great service in the cure of many specific dis-* eases; for, whatever the specific disease may be, we are always to treat the patient in* one respect according to the general nature of the inflammation; and if we have a spc-B cific remedy we are also to join that with the other; but if we have not a specific remedy, we are then only to take up the disease according to the constitution. Let us illustrate the foregoing propositions by example. The first case is explained # by the venereal disease in the form of a chancre: the venereal matter produces an in-* flammation and ulceration according to the nature of the specific disease and the con-* stitution; if the constitution is perfectly healthy, then the effects are the suppurative and specific disease joined; the limits of both are confined according to the constitution J and the nature of the specific disease, for the inflammation and ulceration never ex- tend beyond the specific affection; but ifithc constitution is such as readily to fall into | the erysipelatous, then it becomes the erysipelatous and specific joined; nnd although ;; the extent of the specific affection is limited, that of the erysipelatous is not: the con-g sequence of which is that it spreads over the whole prepuce, and often the whole skin of the penis. j In this disease, under such circumstances, we are led to the method of cure: for although we have a medicine for the venereal inflammation, yet bark is to be given for the erysipelatous; the quantity to be given is according to the predominancy of the one or the other. The effects of this practice are very striking: for as the ery- sipelatous inflammation lessens it becomes more confined in its limits, and, as it were, drawn into the original point; and when it becomes truly suppurative and venereal) its limits then are brought within the specific distance. The second case is explained by the smallpox. The variolous matter in healthy constitutions produces the suppurative and specific inflammations: the specific is limited,

521 THE TREATMENT OF ABSCESSES. between its commencement and opening, it also requires but very little attention afterwards for the cure or the restoring the parts. This depends more on the operation of the powers or abilities the machine is in pos- session of, than on any assistance the surgeon can give ; however, ab- scesses may have other circumstances attending them, besides soundness and unsoundness, which will require surgical treatment; such as the extraction of exfoliated bones, which by their stay retard the cure. Further, as few inflammations arise in perfectly sound parts and consti- tutions, it will generally be necessary to treat them in some degree as if they had an unsound tendency, and also according to other circum- stances. As no abscess can set about a cure till the matter is discharged, the first process, therefore, is the discharge of the matter; but simply dis- charge is not always sufficient; therefore it becomes necessary to con- sider whether or not, almost in every case it would not be proper to do more; and I am inclined to believe that whatever would in general as- sist an unsound abscess, would also do the same to a sound one; but this practice should be followed with great caution, and not carried too far, for in many it will be perfectly unnecessary, therefore it should not be practised; in others it will only be necessary in part; besides, in many cases it may do harm, for many abscesses may have tolerable dis- positions under the present treatment, yet may be in such a state as very readily to fall into an unsound one, of some kind or other, when too much violence is committed; some having a tendency to irritability: on the other hand, our practice may fall short of the intention, as many parts have a strong tendency to indolence ; and if the stimulating me- thod is applied to the first it would be unlucky, and vice versa. It will be generally more in the power of the parts to perform a cure if certain operations are done, which even dispose the most active and healthy disposition, both of constitution and of parts to heal sooner; but this does not hold of the irritable. The first of these operations will he the mode of exposing abscesses, by opening them sufficiently, which will make any particular treatment afterwards, either less neces- sary, or more easy of application, if necessary ; so that the first principle of the cure, even of sound abscesses, may be the freedom of opening them in the beginning; however, the more sound they are, there is the less necessity for such treatment; for if it does not give new powers to the parts, it keeps up those of which they are already in possession, and obliges them to go on towards a cure for the living principle in parts, more especially sound parts, seems uneasy under the circumstance of ex- posure, and of having no skin, and therefore is roused to action, acting with a view to cover the part. It has no alternative; and, as I have

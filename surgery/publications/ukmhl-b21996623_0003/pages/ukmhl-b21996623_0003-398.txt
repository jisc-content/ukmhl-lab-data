TIIF. ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. 372 and as inflammation must precede it, the parts must submit to those regular processes, for it must be supposed to be capable of diverting the disease to this part. ยง. 10. Of the Methods of Resolution by constitutional means. The first thing to he considered is the kind of inflammation, when visible, which will in some degree show the kind of constitution; the next is the nature of the part inflamed, and the stage of inflammation ; for upon these depend in some measure the method of relief. In cases of exposed internal surfaces the inflammation cannot be resolved, be- cause the cause still exists till inflammation has resolved itself; but it may be lessened, and this probably takes place by lessening everything which has a tendency to keep it up ; and in all likelihood little more can be done in spontaneous inflammations ; for as yet we know of no method which will entirely quiet or remove the inflammatory disposition or mode of action, as there is no inflammatory specific with which we are ac- quainted. When I described inflammation I observed there was either an in- crease of life, or an increased disposition to use with more violence the life which the machine or the part was in possession of; and also there was an increased size of vessels, and of course an increased circulation in the part inflamed, and in the constitution in general. If this theory of the mode of action of the vessels in inflammation is just, then our practice is reducible ta two principles, one consisting in removing the cause of that action, the other in counteracting the effect. As to the first, as we seldom know the cause, but only see the effect, except in some specific diseases, for which we have a specific remedy, we do not know with any degree of certainty how to act; but as to the second, that is, the effect, as it is more an object of our senses, we can apply with more certainty our reasoning upon it, for reasoning from analogy will assist us in our attempts. We find, from common observation, that many cir- cumstances in life, as also many applications to parts, will call forth the contraction of the vessels; we are, therefore, from the above theory, to apply such means : and whatever w ill do this, without irritation, will so far counteract the effect*. I have already observed, that wherever there has been a violence committed, or some violent action is going on, there is a greater influx โข As this is a new theory of die action of the vessels in inflammation, and the only one that can possibly direct to a method of cure, it is to be hoped that attention will be paid to it, and, if just, that more certain methods of resolution will be discovered.

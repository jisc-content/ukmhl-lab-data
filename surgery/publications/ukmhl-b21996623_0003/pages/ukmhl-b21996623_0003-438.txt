412 OF THE SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION. Opium often lessens actions, although it seldom alters them, when only given as an opiate, and may be of a temporary service : however, this ia not always a consequence of opium, as there are constitutions where it increases irritation, and of course diseased action. Fresh wounds, considered simply as wounds, are all of the same na- ture, and require one uniform treatment, the intention being to put them into that situation in which they can suppurate with most ease to them- selves ; and the first dressings commonly remain till suppuration comes on, unless some peculiarity from the situation of parts, or other collate- ral circumstances, should make it necessary to remove the dressings or vary the treatment. The difference between one wound and another, with respect to the nature of the part wounded, will vary very much; some will have small vessels wounded that cannot be conveniently got at, in order to tie them up, yet should be stopt from bleeding, which can be done by the mode of dressing, and therefore require dressing suitable to this circumstance alone. Wounds opening into cavities, where peculiarities of the contained parts are joined with the injury done to them by the accident, will re- quire a suitable mode of dressing; the influence, too, that a simple wound in the containing parts may have upon those in the cavity, as a wound into the belly, thorax, joints, skull, etc., will oblige the surgeon to vary the mode of dressing from that of a simple wound; w hile many wounds will require being kept open for fear of uniting again, in order to answer some future purpose, as the wound made into the tunica vaginalis testis, for the radical cure of the hydrocele; others may require attention being paid to them before suppuration comes on, and therefore should be so dressed as to admit of being soon and easily removed, to examine the parts occasionally as the symptoms arise. 1 his ought to be the case in wounds of the head, attended or not attended with fracture of the skull. But whatever mode of application may be thought necessary to answer the various attending circumstances, yet as they aie all wounds which are to come to suppuration, one general method is to be followed re- specting them all, as far as those peculiarities will allow. The application which has been made to wrounds for some years past in this country has been in general dry lint. What brought this appli- cation into common practice most probably was, its assisting to stop the hemorrhage; and as most wounds are attended with bleeding, it became universal; but as it became universal, the first intention was lost sight of, and it became simply a first dressing. I need hardly remark here, that all wounds that arc to suppurate arc first attended with inflammation, and therefore arc so far similar to

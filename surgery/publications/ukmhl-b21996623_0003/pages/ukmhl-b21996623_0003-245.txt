OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 219 of the artery are brought to a more equal state ; for this additional quan- tity of blood that was at first in one part only, is in some degree equally diffused through the whole arterial system ; by which means, too, it is be- coming proportionably slower in its motion: but all these circumstances will vary according as the arterial system consists of cylinders or cones ; and if of cones, then according to the extremity ■which is the base ; all of which may be conjectured, but cannot be exactly estimated. Yet that the force of the heart might not be lost, the elasticity of the great ar- tery, over the smaller, is happily applied, because it propels the blood more forcibly on, between the strokes of the heart; for although we are to suppose that the heart, which was capable of distending a part, so as to make it re-act, and send the blood through any given length, was also capable of sending it through that length at once, yet we must see, that by an elastic power being applied at one end, while this is gra- dually lost towards the other, the elastic part acts with a superior force over the other, in the proportion as the other has less elasticity. This other being also less upon the stretch, is overcome by that wThich is more so, which is always the end next to the heart; for the muscular part relaxes, requiring hardly any force to distend it; and indeed, as the muscular power has contracted the artery within its middle or stationary state, and this more and more as we get into smaller vessels, the mus- cular coat is at first stretched by the recovery of the elastic power; so that the blood passes into the smaller branches with much less resis- tance than it would have done if the vessels had been elastic in propor- tion to their size. These proportions, however, in the blood’s motion, arising from the elastic power of the arteries, will not be the same in the foetus and adult, and will be still more different in the aged subject; for in this last the elastic power of the artery is diminishing as well as the muscular, the coats becoming more rigid; besides which, the vessels vary from a conical shape (whose apex is at the heart and basis at their extremities) towards a cylinder; and this change is also increased by the loss of many of the smaller vessels; so that as we grow up, the base of the cone is gradually diminished from two causes. The elastic power will allow of a quantity of blood in the animal be- yond the natural state of the artery, and the muscular power will allow of a smaller, without the animal being affected, although the muscular alone would have answered both these purposes. Arteries, then, are the conductors and disposers of the blood: as conductors they are, in every animal above fish, both passive and active; passive, in admitting of the propelling power of the heart; and active, in continuing that power to the extreme part. Besides these reasons for a difference in the velocities of the blood

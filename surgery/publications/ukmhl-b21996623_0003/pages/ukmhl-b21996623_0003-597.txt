OF THE TREATMENT OF GUN-SIIOT WOUNDS. 571 wounds of the former kind, but generally heal very quick at first, upon the going off of the inflammation, similar to the healing of simple gun- shot wounds; but when healed so far as to be affected by the extraneous bodies, then they become slow in their progress, till at last they come to a stand, or become fistulous; in which state they continue till the irritating cause is removed : and this takes place even if the dilatation should have been made at first as large as could be thought necessary; so that the opening at first, in such cases, can only let out those extra- neous bodies or detached bones that are perfectly loose, or become loose while the wound continues large : however, even this can only take place in superficial wounds; but in those that are deep, or where there is an exfoliation to take place, the dilated part always heals up long before they are fit to make their exit; but before this happens the parts often acquire an indolent diseased state, and even when all extraneous bodies are extracted the parts do not readily heal. When a wound comes to this stage, surgeons generally put in sponge or other tents into the opening, or apply some corroding medicine to keep it open, and also with a view to make it wider; but this practice is unnecessary, as a wound in such a state seldom heals entirely over, nor do tents add much to the width of the wound, and always confine the matter [for the time] between the two dressings. Where an exfoliation is expected, it is generally better to expose as much of the bone as possible : it keeps up a kind of inflammation, which I imagine gives a disposition for this process. This can only be done where the bone is pretty superficial; but in cases where the separation has already taken place, and it is dow to make its way to the skin, like any other extraneous substance, then, instead of the practice of sponge tents to keep the orifice in the skin open, it would be often better in such cases to let the whole heal over; because the extraneous body would form an abscess round itself, which would enlarge the cavity, and produce the ulcerative inflammation quicker towards the surface; and when that was opened, the extraneous body could be with more ease extracted, or would come out of itself: but this method of healing the mouths of fistulous sores is not always practicable. If this last practice has no inconveniences attending it, it has this advantage, that the patient has not the disagreeable trouble of having a sore to dress every day till the extraneous body comes awav, which I think is no small consideration. This practice, however, is not to be followed in every case : for instance, if the wound should communicate with a joint, as is common to most sores in the foot and hand where the bones are diseased, it would be in such cases very imprudent to allow the wound to heal, as the confined matter would get more rcadilv

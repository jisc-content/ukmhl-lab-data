522 THE TREATMENT OF ABSCESSES. just now observed that few spontaneous abscesses take place from so slight a cause as simple violence produces, there must be a something to be got the better of. This is, perhaps, as well illustrated in the fi- stula in ano, as in any other; for without dividing along the gut to the bottom, which is where the disease is, and where the abscess has formed, it seldom or never heals; however, all this will be according to cir- cumstances, for if the suppuration is quick and comes fast to the skin, the parts will heal in the same proportion more readily, cither with or without opening; therefore, in such instances, it is not so necessary to open freely, though as it is not the method nature commonly takes, it has by many been objected to; but let us observe, that where an ab- scess opens of itself by a small orifice, the parts are commonly very sound where the opening is, although the bottom may be diseased ; but if it be diseased where it opens, then ulceration commonly hikes place at this orifice, which effects what should be done by art. To illustrate that a large opening is not detrimental to the healing of a sore, let us observe that there is no difference between an abscess opened largely, and a wound in consequence of an operation which is not healed by the first intention, such as an amputation, etc.; for in such cases there is a breach in the continuity of the parts communicating with the skin, as large, if not larger than at the bottom, and it heals readily. We endeavour, however, to remedy this as much as possible by saving skin, which, in some degree answers to a small opening; and we may also observe that where there is only a small opening leading to a large cavity, which is to suppurate, as in the case of a hydrocele treated by a caustic or seton, (which when come to suppuration is in all respects si- milar to an abscess,) the whole so far as suppuration extends, heals equally well with those that are wholly exposed; but I do not know that they do better: and where the sac is not very sound I do believe they do not so well as when more fully enlarged : and we may also observe, that opening largely into the scrotum is not subject to the same inconvenience as in many other parts, for here there is so much loose skin as to remove any retardment to the healing that might arise in other parts from opening largely: however, after viewing this in every light, there seems but little advantage gained in the one way or the other. The opening more or less freely must be directed by some other circumstance, by which the surgeon must be guided. But as most ab- scesses owe some of their size to distention, and as this will be more or less according to circumstances, it becomes necessary to distinguish the one kind from the other, for the one will require a freer opening than the other. Abscesses in soft parts will owe more of their size to distention than

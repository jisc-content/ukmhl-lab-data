■r)72 OF THE TREATMENT OF GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. into the different joints, and increase the disease: there may be other causes to forbid this as a general practice. If wounds are to be kept open at their mouths, whose bottoms have not a disposition to heal, they should be kept open to that bottom; be- cause, whenever they do heal at their mouths, it is most commonly owing to their sides underneath first uniting; for the skin will seldom unite when all beyond it is open. In wounds that become fistulous, where there is no extraneous body, there is always a diseased bottom, which is to be looked upon as having the same eflect as an extraneous substance. To alter this diseased dis- position they should be opened freely, as large openings produce quick inflammation, quick suppuration, and quick granulations, which are ge- nerally sound when they arise from such a cause : on the other hand, letting such wounds heal at their mouths has often a salutary effect, as it becomes a means of destroying this diseased part by the formation of an abscess there, and in general there can be no better way of coming at a part or extraneous body than by the formation of an abscess there. It is a natural way of opening to relieve diseased parts; but we often find in practice that this method is not sufficient, either for the extrac- tion of extraneous bodies, or to expose the diseased bottom, excepting these abscesses are opened very largely by art, so as to expose the whole of the diseased parts or extraneous body. §• 7* Of the Time proper fur removing Incurable Parts. Many gun-shot wounds are at the very first evidently incurable, whether in a part that cannot be removed, or in one that will admit of being removed. When such wounds are in parts that will not admit of a removal of the parts injured, then nothing can be done by surgery ; but when in a part that can be removed, then a removal of the injured part is to be put in practice ; but even this is to be under certain restrictions : perhaps it should not be done immediately upon the receiving of the injury, excepting where a considerable blood-vessel is wounded, so as to endanger the life of the person, and that it absolutely cannot be tiiken up, or it is suspected that the inflammation in consequence of the accident will kill, by which means you have only the inflammation in consequence of the amputation; but this is a bad resource, especially if it is a lower extremity that is to be amputated, and which is perhaps the only part that can be removed of which the inflammation will kill. How far the same practice is to be followed in cases which we may suppose will not kill, but that the part is so hurt as to all appearance

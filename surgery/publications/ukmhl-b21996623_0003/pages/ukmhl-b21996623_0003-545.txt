THE TREATMENT OF ABSCESSES. 519 seated than the surface of the body, such of course must form what are called abscesses, or collections of pus; therefore we have abscesses of all depths, from the pimple in the skin to the boil, and from the boil to deep-seated abscesses among the muscles, or in any other deep-seated part. Abscesses are commonly formed where matter is found, especially the more superficial ones, and such may be justly called abscesses of this part; but collections of matter are often found in parts where not formed, more especially in the deeper-seated ones ; the matter moving from the seat where it was formed to some more depending part, or having met with some obstruction in its course, it takes another direction and there- fore may be called an abscess in this part; and I shall call them so in my descriptions of them. 1 believe such abscesses do not arise from in- flammation, but are of the scrofulous kind, and therefore not so much to our present purpose. It will be difficult to divide abscesses into absolutely distinct classes; but, similarly to inflammation, they may be divided into two kinds, the sound and the unsound ; lor I imagine these two first principles might lead to the method of cure ; but at present I only mean to lay down the principles of an abscess. f he appearances which distinguish the sound from the unsound ab- scess are several; although there are many abscesses of particular kinds that give little or no information. They often differ from one another in their first appearance from the kind of inflammation, as also in their course, but more particularly in their efforts toward a cure. Thus we judge of the consequences of the smallpox from the first ap- pearance of the arm after inoculation ; for if the beginning inflamma- tion is small, pretty much circumscribed, and of the florid red with some rising, then we may in our own minds expect a good kind; the same upon the first appearance of the smallpox themselves; as also the first appearance of chancre, etc., or almost of any other disease, either begin- ning with or attended by inflammation ; for it is by the kind of inflam- mation we are to judge of the future event. It might be thought almost unnecessary here to treat of sound ab- scesses, because in such our first principles will readily take place, and often little or no assistance is required ; but abscesses may be attended with circumstances which may retard the cure, and which have nothing to do with unsoundness, such as extraneous bodies in sound parts; and these will most probably come under our general principles of cure, that is, require something to be done, because they will in many cases re- lieve themselves of the extraneous matter, and then they require but little assistance.

OF T1IE SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION. 428 gular stated times, have all the characters of an intermittent fever; but it may be observed that, in common, rigors preceding suppuration are not followed by so much heat and sweating as those in an inter- mittent. In spontaneous inflammations it is not so easy to ascertain whether the constitution or the part is first affected ; and if we always could, it would be the best guide to know whether the inflammation was local entirely, or an effect of a constitutional affection: nothing but the pri- ority of the symptoms can in some degree fix this; but the constitutional symptoms are often so slight, at least at first, as not to be taken notice of. However, we know that indispositions of the constitution are pro- ductive of local complaints, which are often attended with inflammation, but which is often according to the nature of the parts *, the constitu- tion being first diseased ; and we know that in many fevers there is sup- puration in some part of the body, and often in particular parts, such as the parotid glands, probably according to the nature of the fever; such inflammations will, according to their violence, add to the consti- tutional affection. Constitutional affection arising from inflammations will be almost coeval with the inflammations, or at least will very soon follow; however, that will be according to the circumstance before re- lated, for inflammation is an act of the part, attended with a degree of violence, and the constitution will feel it sooner or later, according to circumstances : we see in cases of inflammation of the testicles from a gonorrhoea (which must be considered as entirely local), that the con- stitution is soon affected by it. But constitutional symptoms arise from external violence alone, and more especially when attended with loss of substance; and they will be sooner or later, according to the degree of the violence, and the importance of the parts lost, agreeably to what has been said; but simple violence, even with the loss of a part, I have al- ready observed, is not of such consequence as we should at first imagine, for in consequence of the loss of a limb, if the parts are allowed to heal by the first intention, the constitution is but little affected; it is, there- fore, violence with loss of substance, and which is to produce inflam- mation and suppuration, that gives rise to the constitutional symptoms; and when these commence, or more probably when the part sets about these operations, the constitution becomes affected. It is more the new disposition in the parts, than the quantity of inflammatory action in them, by which the constitution is affected, for we shall see that upon * Local inflammations arising from derangement of the constitution I think are most commonly of the scrofulous kind, more especially when in parts of a particular nature, such as lymphatic glands and ligamentous or tendinous parts, which, when in particular situations, are often supposed to be venereal.

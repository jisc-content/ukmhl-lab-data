(I. 278, and IV. 131.) It only, therefore, becomes necessary to mention here the intimate association which exists in all instances between the calorific and respiratory functions, so that throughout the animal scries the degree of temperature evolved is in accurate correspondence with the elaborateness of the respiratory appa- ratus and the perfection with which the chemical changes on the blood are accomplished, leaving no doubt in the mind as to the relation in which these functions stand to each other. If we adopt the view formerly suggested (see note, p. 94), of the absorp- tion of oxygen into the blood, and its gradual conversion into carbonic acid in the course of the circulation, especially in the peripheral capillaries, it will not be difficult to ex- plain the variations which sometimes occur in the local temperature, depending, as they would seem to do, on the varying afflux of blood to particular parts, or to the varying activity of the nutritive functions. That these circumstances, however, are greatly under the dominion of the nervous system, the observations and experiments of Ilrodie, Home, Earle, Wilson Philip, Mayo, Le Gallois, and others have incontestably proved (Phil. Trans., ci. 36, cii. 380, cxv. 7; Med. Cliir. Trans., vii. 173; Ann. de Chimie, iv (1817) j and Wilson Philip, On the Vital Functions, 2nd edit., p. 168), although in no

499 GRANULATIONS. might ask the following question: Does the surrounding skin in the healing of a sore lengthen by growth, or does it lengthen by stretching only? I think that the former is most probable; and if this is the case I should call this process interstitial growth, similar to the growtli of the ears of the people in the Eastern islands, particularly as it is an opposite effect to interstitial absorption. Granulations appear to have other powers of action besides simply their oeconomy tending to a cure. They have power of action in the whole, so as to produce other operations, and even to affect other mat- ter. I conceive that a deep wound, such as a gun-shot wound, advanced to suppuration and granulation, and also a fistula, become in some de- gree similar to an excretory duct, having the powers of a peristaltic motion from the bottom towards the opening externally. Thus we find that whatever extraneous body is situated at the bottom of the sore, is by degrees conducted to the skin, although the bottom of the sore’or fistula is of the same depth. This effect in such sores does not arise from the granulations forming at the bottom, and gradually raising the extraneous body as they form (which is commonly the case with exfo- liations and sloughs), but we find extraneous bodies come to the skin when the bottom of the wound is not granulating11. [This effect is rather to be attributed to the gradual contraction of the fistula from the bottom, winch may therefore be represented by an inverted cone. The ascent of fluids against the force of gravity, as of the semen along the Fallopian tubes, the secre- tion of the lungs along the surface of the trachea, fire., is probably referrible in many in- stances to the actions of vibratory cilia, with which, according to recent discovery, tl«> mucous membranes are found to be abundantly provided.] 2 tv 2

OF GUN-SHOT WOUNDS. 5-i-i there will be nearly us quick inflammation as in a compound fracture of the same bone, because the deadened part bears no proportion to the laceration or wound in general. From this circumstance, of a part being often deadened, a gun-shot wound is often not completely understood at first; for it is at first, in many cases, impossible to know what parts are killed, whether bone, tendon, or soft part, till the deadened part has separated, which often makes it a much more complicated wound than at first was known or imagined ; for it very often happens that some viscus, or a part of some viscus, or a part of a large artery, or even a bone, has been killed by the blow, which does not show itself till the slough comes away. If, for instance, it is a part of an intestine thht has received a contusion so as to kill it, and which is to slough, a new symptom will most pro- bably appear from the sloughs being separated, the contents of the in- testine will most probably come through the wound, and probably the same thing will happen when any other containing viscus is in’part deadened; but those cases will not be so dangerous as if the same loss had been produced at first, for by this time all communication will be cut off between the containing and contained parts : nor will it be so dangerous as when a considerable blood-vessel is deadened; for in this case, when the slough comes off, the blood, getting a free passage into the wound, as also out of it, probably death will immediately follow. If this artery is internal, nothing can be done; if in an extremity, the vessel may be either taken up, or probably amputation may be neces- sary to save the person’s life; therefore an early attention should be paid to accidents where such an event is possible. In case of a bone being deadened an exfoliation takes place. Gun-shot wounds are often such as do much mischief to vital parts, the effects of which will be according to the nature of the parts wounded and the violence of the wound; and also to parts, the soundness of which are essential either to the health of the whole, or to the uses of the parts wounded : such as some viscus, whose contents are voided through the opening or joints, the disposition of which is slow to heal, and whose uses are impeded when healed. Gun-shot wounds often admit of being classed with the small and deep-seated wounds, which are always of a particular kind respecting the cure. File variety of circumstances attending gun-shot wounds is almost endless: the following case may be given as an example. An officer in the navy was wounded by a pistol-ball in the right side, about the last rib; it entered about five inches from the navel, and ap- peared on the inside of the skin about two inches from the spinal pro-

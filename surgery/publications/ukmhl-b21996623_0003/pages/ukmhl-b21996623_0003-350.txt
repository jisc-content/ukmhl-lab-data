324 THE ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. the blood-vessels fuller than common, yet distinct in such membranes, we are not to call that inflammation, although it may be the first step, as we find to be the case in the first action of the vessels in consequence of such irritation as will end in inflammation. As it may not, however, be the first step, there must be other attending circumstances to deter- mine it to be the very first action of the vessels in inflammation, for as that appearance may either belong to a briskness in the circulation in the part at the time, or be the very first step in inflammation, their causes are to be discriminated by some other symptom. They are both a kind of blush, or an exertion of the action of the vessels; but when it is an effect of an inflammatory cause, it is then only that the inflam- mation has not yet produced any change in the natural structure of the parts, but which it will soon do*. What the action is, or in what it differs from the common action of the vessels, is not easily ascertained, since we are more able to judge of the effects than the immediate cause. However, it is probably an action of the vessels, which we can better observe than any diseased action in the body, for we can observe the state in which the arteries are, with their general effects; we feel also a different temperature respecting heat, yet the immediate cause may not be ascertainable. The vessels, both arteries and veins, in the inflamed part are enlarged, and the part becomes visibly more vascular; from which we should sus- pect, that instead of an increased contraction, there was rather what would appear an increased relaxation of their muscular powers, being, as we might suppose, left to the elasticity entirely. This would be re- ducing them to a state of paralysis simply ; but the power of muscular contraction would seem to give way in inflammation, for they certainly dilate more in inflammation than the extent of the elastic power would allow ; and it must also be supposed that the elastic power of the artery must be dilated in the same proportion. The contents of the circula- tion being thrown out upon such occasions, would, from considering it in those lights, rather confirm us in that opinion; and when we con- sider the whole of this as a necessary operation of nature, we must sup- pose it something more than simply a common relaxation; we must suppose it an action in the parts to produce an increase of size to answer particular purposes; and this I should call the action of dilatation, as we see the uterus increase in size in the time of uterine-gestation, as * When this appearance is seen anywhere after death it should not he called inflam- mation, even although we knew it was the first action of inflammation; for as we are then only looking out for the causes of death, or the symptoms prior to death, we are only to look out for such as can be a cause, and not lay hold of those that cannot pos* sibly be a cause, which those first actions cannot be.

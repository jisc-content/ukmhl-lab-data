463 THE ULCERATIVE INFLAMMATION. bones, etc., they were driven to the necessity of supposing a solvent : this may or may not be true ; it is one of those hypotheses that can never be proved or disproved, and may for ever rest upon opinion. But my conception of this matter is, that Nature leaves as little as possible to chance, and that the whole operation of absorption is performed by an action in the mouths of the absorbents : but even under the idea of ca- pillar}' tubes, physiologists were still obliged to have recourse to the action of those vessels to carry it along after it was absorbed, and might therefore as well have carried this action to the mouths of these vessels. As we know nothing of the mode of action of the mouths of these vessels, it is impossible we can form any opinion that can be relied upon; but sis they are capable of absorbing substances in two different states, that of solidity and fluidity, it is reasonable to suppose that they have different modes of action ; for although any construction of parts that is capable of absorbing a solid may also be such as is capable of absorbing a fluid, yet I can suppose a construction only capable of absorbing a fluid, and not at all fitted for absorbing a solid, though this is not likely; and to see the propriety of this remark more forcibly, let us only con- sider the mouths of different animals, and I will venture to say that the mouths of all the different animals have not a greater variety of sub- stances to work upon than the absorbents have; and we may observe, that with all the variety of mouths in different animals, this variety is only for the purpose of adapting them to absorb solids, which admit of great variety in form, texture, etc., every one being capable of absorb- ing fluid matter, which admits of no variety. This process of the removal of parts of the body, either by interstitial or progressive absorption, answers very material purposes in the ma- chine, without w hich many local diseases could not be removed, and which, if allowed to remain, would destroy the person. It may be called in such cases the natural surgeon. It is by the progressive absorption that matter or pus, and extraneous bodies of all kinds, whether in consequence of or producing inflamma- tion and suppuration, are brought to the external surface; it is by means of this that bones exfoliate; it is this operation which separates sloughs ; it is the absorbents which are removing whole bones while the arteries aie supplying new ones; and although in these last cases of bones it arises fiom disease, yet it is somewhat similar to the modelling process of this system in the natural formation of bone ; it is this operation that removes useless parts, as the alveolar processes when the teeth drop out, or when they are removed by art; as also the fangs of the shedding teeth, which allows them to drop off; and it is by these means ulcers are formed.

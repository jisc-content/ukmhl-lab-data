o!2 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INFLAMMATION. sensible effects of inflammation. It is most probably what may be called a true specific inflammation, for it produces the same immediate effects in every constitution, therefore does not produce an inflammation ac- cording to the constitution, having the specific action added, similar to poisons; but from its nature it produces the same effects in every con- stitution. I have seen constitutions whose extremities were attacked Avith the cedematous inflammation, attended with a purplish appearance ; violent pain in such cases comes on, which creates some apprehensions of a tendency to mortification : upon looking at the part Ave may sus- pect suppuration, the inflammation to appearance being of that kind; but may think it odd that such healthy inflammation and suppuration should take place in the midst of inflammation of so contrary a kind, but shall find no suppuration ; the inflammation shall continue its pe- riod and then leave the extremities in a much better state than it found them. Although the inflammatory action of the gout is attended with great pain, yet I think it is not so tender as the true inflammation is : a part may be violently inflamed, and yet it may be handled or squeezed ; the nerves are not in such a state of irritation : its consequent effects are ATery different from that of the true inflammation, for instead of entire resolution it gives the disposition to the inflamed parts to fill the joint, or whatever parts have been affected, as, for instance, the cellular mem- brane Avith chalk a. However, chalk is not necessarily an effect of the gouty inflamma- tion ; for in a gouty habit Ave have chalk formed Avhere there never had been any gouty inflammation, yet it is singular it should attack such dissimilar parts as the skin, ligaments, &c. It has not only no ten- dency to suppuration, as an immediate effect of inflammation, but it leaves the parts in a state not easily excited to inflammation : the chalk shall remain for years without producing inflammation, and seldom pro- duces it at all but from quantity; and when the interior surfaces are exposed they hardly take on common inflammation and suppuration, healing more readily than a sore of the same magnitude from any other cause: even a joint shall be exposed, yet common inflammation shall not come on, nor shall it suppurate ; only a watery fluid shall come out, bringing Avith it the chalk occasionally, and it shall heal up kindly. It is probable that the gout is not always an act of the constitution, but * [The experiments of Wollaston have shown that these tophaceous depositions con- sist principally of urate of soda, combined with a little urate and phosphate of lime. The most remarkable fact, however, connected with the appearance of gouty concre- tions, is the coexistence or alternate deposition of uric acid from the urine: so that a paroxysm of gout is not unfrequcntly known to pass off by a copious secretion of this acid from the kidneys.]

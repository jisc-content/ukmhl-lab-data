403 OF THE SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION. CHAPTER IV. OF THE SUPPURATIVE INFLAMMATION. When the adhesive inflammation is not capable of resolution, and has gone as far as possible to prevent the necessity of suppuration, espe- cially in those cases that might have admitted of a resolution, as in spontaneous* inflammations in general, where there has neither been an exposed laceration of the solids, nor, as before mentioned, loss of substance, but where the natural functions of the part have only been so deranged that it was unable to fall back into a natural and sound state again; or, secondly, where it was a consequence of such accidents, as the effects of the adhesive could not in the least prevent, (as in wounds that were prevented from healing by the first or second inten- tention,) then, under either of these two circumstances, suppuration takes place. The immediate effect of suppuration is the production of pus from the inflamed surface, which appears in such cases, or under such cir- cumstances, to be a leading step to the formation of a new substance, called granulations, which granulations are the third method in the first order of parts of restoring those parts to health; but upon all internal canals suppuration is certainly not a leading step to granulations, which will be explained hereafter. The same theory of the adhesive inflammation respecting the vessels is, I believe, applicable to the suppurative ; for when suppuration is the first, we have the vessels in the same state as in the adhesive when it happens, but their dispositions and actions must have altered, there being a great difference in their effects. 1 his is so much the case, that the true inflammatory disposition and action almost immediately ceases upon the commencement of suppu- ration ; and although the vessels may be nearly in the same state, yet they are in a much more quiescent state than before, and have acquired a new mode of action. I shall endeavour to establish as an invariable fact that no suppura- tion takes place which is not preceded by inflammation; that is, that no I have used this word to denote a case where no visible cause of inflammation exist* j or strictly there can be no such thing in nature as spontaneous. 2 d 2

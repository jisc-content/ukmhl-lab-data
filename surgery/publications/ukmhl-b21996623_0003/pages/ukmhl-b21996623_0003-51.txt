25 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE BLOOD. changes take place in matter of which the immediate causes are un- known, the mind refers them to some circumstances which accompany these changes, although, perhaps, they may have had no concern what- ever in producing them, and may be only attendants, i his will always be the case where those changes arise out of the nature of the part it- self. A seed put into moist ground grows; but the moist ground is only a necessary attendant, and not the immediate cause. The life of the seed, stimulated to action by the moisture, is the immediate cause of its growth, and it continues to grow because its action is always ex- ami least of all in the middle (op. cit., p. 55). I apprehend, however, that the latter part of this statement tends very much to weaken our confidence in these ex- periments. In regard to the duration of the contractility of the clot, Mr. Thackrah observes, that « the quantity of serum decidedly increased for three days, was nearly stationary on the fourth day, and on the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth progressively diminished.” Hence it seems that the contractility of the clot continues for three days, during which time serum is expelled; but after that period relaxation occurs, and a part of the ex- pressed serum is reabsorbed. As the degree in which the clot contracts is inversely as the rapidity of the coagula- tion, whatever influences the coagulation of the blood so as to accelerate or retard this process will have a corresponding influence on the contraction of the clot and the relative quantity of serum which is afterwards expressed. About 10 parts serum to 13—14 crassamentum may be assumed as the standard of health; but, like the contraction of muscles after death, it varies infinitely in different cases. Dr. Babington found the proportion of serum and crassamentum to vary materially in the same blood drawn into differently-shaped vessels. Thus, blood drawn into a pear-shaped vessel and a common basin exhibited the following differences: 1 Tempe of blood. raturc of scrum Specific of blood. gravity of scrum Crass, in pear-shaped bottle.

Perhaps few facts relating to the phenomena of venesection are of more practical importance than this, since blood is said to be thick or thin, rich or poor, in reference to the quantity of crassamentum it contains, and views of a disease are founded upon these supposed conditions, which, after all, depend not on the blood itself, but on the vessel into which it is received” (op. cit., p. 297). Thackrah found a similar diversity to arise from the composition of the recipient vessel, a circumstance wltich he attributed to the electric states of the different metals composing it. Thus, while one quantity of the same blood coagulated in a copper vessel in two minutes,and afforded 345-7 serum to 654-3 crass., another equal quantity coagulated in a pewter vessel in 1 miu. and 10 see., and afforded only 54" 1 serum to 945-9 crass, (op. cit., p. 66).]

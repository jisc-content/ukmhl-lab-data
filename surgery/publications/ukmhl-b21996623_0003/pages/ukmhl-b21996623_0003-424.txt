398 THE ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. have been formed; or if inflammation lias gone so far as to produce swelling, which is the adhesive stage of the disease, it by certain me- thods can be frequently so assuaged as to prevent suppuration taking place, and then the parts will fall back into their natural state, which is called resolution, some adhesions being perhaps the only remaining con- sequences of the inflammation. The same methods are likewise often used with considerable success in lessening inflammation arising from violence, so as to prevent sup- puration entirely; but in many of these cases they are not sufficient, and in those where it cannot be prevented, yet it may be lessened by the same means. As the first symptom of inflammation is commonly pain, so is the first symptom of resolution a cessation of that pain, as well as one of the symptoms of suppuration, which is a species of resolution. I have known the cessation of pain so quick as to appear like a charm, although no other visible alteration had taken place, the swelling and colour being the same. Why inflammation of any kind should cease after it has once begun is very difficult to explain, or even to form an idea of, since as yet we have no mode of counteracting the first cause, or irritation. It may be supposed to arise from the principle, of parts adapting themselves in time to their present situation, which I call custom ; and that therefore, in order to keep up the inflammation, it would be necessary for the cause to increase in proportion as the parts get reconciled to their present cir- cumstances. But, allowing this to be the cause, it will not account for their returning back to their natural or original state, when this increase of irritation ceases, and only the last or original irritation remains ; for upon this principle they only grow more easy under their present state, or perhaps, which is worse, acquire a habit of it, which may be the cause of many indolent specific diseases. If we suppose the removal of the original cause to be sufficient to stop the progress of inflammation, and when this is stopped that the parts cannot easily remain in the same inflamed state, but by their own efforts begin to restore themselves to health, (which we can easily conceive to be the case in specific diseases, especially those arising from poisons of such kinds as are capable of a termination, as the smallpox, or where a cure can be administered for the effects of the poison, as in the lues venerea,) then we must conclude that the inflamed state is an uneasy state,â€”a force upon the organs which suffer it, like the bending of a spring, which is always endeavouring to restore itself, and the moment that the power is removed returns back to its natural slate again ; or it may be like the mind, forgetful of injuries.

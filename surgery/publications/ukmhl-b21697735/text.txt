The posterior edges of the fracture pressed upon the anterior surface of the cord opposite the origins of the seventh and eighth cervical nerves. The spinous processes of the fourth, fifth and sixth vertebrae were dislocated and sufficiently fractured to press upon the roots of the sixth, but not on those of the fifth nerve. At the points of direct injury the cord in the recent state was inflamed and disorganized into a red pulp, which, in a degree, is seen by a vertical section of the wet specimen. The origin of the phrenic nerve was uninjured by the accident, but became gradually involved in the inflammation which extended along the gray substance almost to the medulla oblongata. Private J. A.

The superior posterior edge of the body of the fifth encroached upon the spinal canal sufficiently to bend it at that point at an abrupt angle, reducing its antero-posterior diameter more than one-half, but the cord was not lacerated nor its meninges torn, which may be accounted for by the separation of one and a half inches between the spinous processes of the fourth and fifth permitting it to bulge posteriorly. On the right side a portion of the anterior tubercle of the transverse process has snapped off. Private J. F., "B," 2d U. S.

It then badly fractured the third, fourth and fifth dorsal vertebras and the fourth rib of the right side. The coracoid and acromial extremities and the glenoid cavity have been the seat of necrosed action, which appears to have been arrested before death. Private N. P., " G," 124th New York, 18: died, 17th May, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon A. Ansell. See 2330, III. A. a. b. 8. 2121. The lower third of the right scapula and the adjoining portions of the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth ribs, b. 42. The ball struck four inches below the axilla, and passing backward escaped at the inferior angle of the scapula. The specimen shows the extremity of the scapula carried away, the tenth rib comminuted, and the ninth contused. The fractured extremities are necrosed. The thoracic surfaces show free deposits of osseous matter which agglutinate them. The specimen is also interesting as a memorial of the ligation of the intercostal artery. Private F.

The upper portion of the left humerus, after death from secondary hajmorrhage following a wound of the axillary C. 1. artery. The point of interest is the condition of the head, which was thus described at the autopsy : "No pus « as found in the shoulder joint. The head of the humerus was very soft, and on cutting through the softened articular cartilage a pasty substance was found beneath it taking the place of much of the spongy extremity of the bone. This pasty substance was the broken-down spongy substance Other organs normal. In the specimen it will be seen that about one-third of the border of the cartilage of incrustation is detached from the bone: this is due to manipulation and maceration." The shaft is irregular and superficially necrosed. A section appears to have been made about the original point of amputation. Private G. R.

The lowest third of the right humerus and the greater portions of the bones of the forearm. The radius is f. 39. shattered in its middle and upper thirds, and the humerus is fractured above the outer condyle, involving the joint. There is no history of the position of the arm at the time of the wound, but an examination of the specimen shows it probably to have been as follows: The forearm, flexed at nearly a right angle, was struck on the posterior surface of the radius in the middle third by a bullet coming from the front. Minute fragments of lead show the nature of the missile and its general direction, and the severe longitudinal splintering indicates its probable course. The missile, slightly deflected, has then struck the humerus just above the outer condyle and, passing backward, broken off a large portion of the posterior surface. The outer condyle is broken and two complete fractures enter the joint. The specimen is chiefly interesting as an illustration how one missile may cause two distinct wounds of the same extremity.

The bones of the left forearm, extensively comminuted. The ulna has three distinct transverse fractures in the d. 8. upper two-thirds, connected by one longitudinal fracture on the posterior surface: the upmost fragment has a complete longitudinal fracture through it extending to the epiphysis. Two inches of the radius at the junction of the lower thirds is wanting, and the entire upper portion of the shaft is comminuted. The injury was probably from shell fire and was followed by primary amputation in the arm. Received after Chancellorsville. 1637.

The battered bullet is mounted with the specimen. A conoidal ball entered the left iliac region, wounded the descending colon, perforated the ilium in its posterior quarter and lodged subcutaneously at the back of the pelvis, whence it was cut out. The intestine adhered to the muscular parietes of the pelvis and communicated with an abscess under the iliaeus internus and psoas magnus, which communicated with both apertures and was probably caused, first by the ball and then by the burrowing of the pus. The cavity of the descending colon was very small; long faeces of small calibre were accustomed to pass out of the wound of entrance. Private J. R.

The lower half of the right femur, exhibiting an osteo-plastic operation. A musket ball entered the outer surface e. 29. of the outer condyle and escaped from the posterior surface in the middle of the lowest third. The bone was much broken on the posterior surface. The femur was amputated a short distance above the wound of entrance, the patella being included in the anterior flap; the line of section not having escaped the wound, another third of an inch was removed ; the femoral surface of the patella was then sawn off and the two cut surfaces of the bone were brought in apposition. The laminated portion of the femur, however, was fractured half an inch above this point, and fissures extended two inches further. On the sixth day sloughing commenced, on the eighth signs of gangrene were noticed, and on the ninth the femur was amputated in the middle third (on account of the burrowing of pus) for secondary hfemorrhage from the popliteal. No plastic deposit could be observed immediately after the operation. Private B., 20: Fredericksburg, 13th December; osteo-plastic operation by Assistant Surgeon J. W. S. Gouley, U. S.

Injection of the carotid arteries revealed the left internal closed, after two and a half inches, by an organized cul dc sac, its distal termination and its branches being undiscovered. It appears the bullet laid open the internal carotid, and a coagulum, sufficient to arrest further haemorrhage, was formed while fainting, and the remainder of the artery was disintegrated and carried away by suppuration. The succeeding haemorrhages may have occurred from minute openings in the external carotid occuning spontaneously and arrested in like manner. (See Am. Jour. Med. Sci. January, 1863, pp. 79-80.)

A cast of the face, deformed by cicatrices at the right side of the mouth, resulting from wound by a fragment of c. 3. shell. The right half of the under lip is drawn in beneath and behind the upper, being adherent to the body of the inferior maxilla. The upper lip is shortened by a band of cicatricial tissue which occupies the vermilion border and arches down across the right angle of the mouth, from which point it sends branches downward and outward, one of the latter extending nearly to the right angle of the lower jaw. The mouth could neither be freely opened nor entirely closed aud there was constant escape of saliva. The cast represents the condition just before a plastic operation for its relief by Dr. Gurdon Buck. Private E. H., " C," 6th Vermont, 22 : Winchester, 19th September, 1864.

A cast of the lower portion of the face, four months after a second plastic operation for the relief of cicatrices c. 6. following a severe shell wound of the right lower jaw. By the first operation much of the original cicatricial tissue was removed and the mouth made more symmetrical, although contracted and drawn to the right side. By this operation the mouth has been enlarged to the left so as to be more serviceable and shapely. Private E.

A cast of the face, representing great deformity after shell fracture of the inferior maxilla. The tipper half of the C. 7. right ramus and the left ramus with the angle supporting two molar teeth are all that remain of the lower jaw. The chin has lost its prominence by retraction. A cicatrix extends from the middle of the right zygoma to the angle of the mouth, where it is adherent to the alveolar margin of the upper jaw, from which the teeth have been carried away. By this adhesion the upper lip is drawn up and greatly lengthened to the right. The lower lip, having been detached by two lacerations at the right angle, has dropped below its proper level, is curved backward and outward upon itself and is adherent. The separation between the two angles is a finger's breadth; it exposes the end of the tongue and permits the constant escape of saliva. Over the left chin deep and irregular cicatrices bind down the integument. In the original, but not fairly represented in the specimen, was a free, callous, thick border of skin stretching from the adherent right angle of the mouth to the left angle of the jaw. This supported the tongue and was evidently the lacerated edge from which the lower lip had been torn. All the upper teeth are gone between the last right molar and the left canine The tongue is limited as to protrusion by adhesions on the right side. Mastication was impracticable, but deglutition was unimpaired. Articulation was very defective. Private W. S., "I," New York Heavy Artillery, 20: Petersburg, 25th March; cicatrized in September; admitted New York City Hospital, 26th October, 1865, where the cast was taken. Contributed by Dr. Gurdon Buck.

The right cheek has been loosened, the right extremity of each lip has been detached from its cicatricial fastening, the angle has been formed anew, and a complete mouth, though much smaller and somewhat protuberant, has been made. The operation was as follows: a horizontal incision along the cicatricial line, crossing the chin to a point below the left angle of the mouth, detached the lower lip. Its entire thickness with its lining mucous membrane was divided. The new angle was formed by paring away the border, at a point on the margin of the upper lip equidistant with the left angle from the median line. Corresponding treatment was applied to the lower lip and the cut surfaces were brought into accurate apposition. The adherent right extremity of the upper lip was dissected up from its alveolar adhesions and an incision was carried upward along the upper margin of the cicatrix, crossing the cheek as high as the zygoma. The skin and subjacent tissue were freely detached toward the temple. Another incision from the termination of the one detaching the lower lip below the left angle of the mouth was carried across the chin to the right, a finger's breadth below the callous border described in 2693, and was continued over the cheek, below and close to the cicatrix, as far as the zygoma. A third incision, from the origin of the last one, was carried perpendicularly two inches downward upon the neck. The integument in the angle between these and that below the incision across the right cheek was extensively detached from the parts beneath. An upper and lower flap, including the entite right cheek and nearly the whole chin, were thus formed. They were separated by the cicatrix crossing the cheek,f>G6 CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION XXV. which was covered dp by paring their edges and adjusting them over it. The parts were supported by closely placed sutures, four of which were twisted. No adhesive straps were used. The operation was performed under ether. The reconstructed mouth permitted the saliva to be retained, afforded some improvement in articulation and added greatly to the appearance. Private W.

A plaster cast of a varicose aneurism of the right side of the neck of thirty years' standing. This man was a. 1. wounded, by a small narrow chisel, ou the anterior face of the cartilaginous meatus behind the tragus, the direction apparently having been downward, inward and forward. There was little haemorrhage, but the neck became prodigiously swollen, the tumefaction remaining for six or eight mouths. The cast represents a (pulsating) tumor three inches in its long (vertical) diameter covered by and attached to an attenuated integument; behind this is another tumor merging imperceptibly into the former, lifting the tragus and lobule, aud traceable into a greatly distended external jugular vein, fully an inch and a quarter in width, which, running forward; makes a sharp turn backward in the middle of the neck and. increased in size, dips downward behind the steruo-cleido-mastoid to empty itself into a conspicuously swollen subclavian vein. The temporal veins were much dilated, while the veins of the upper extremity are but little affected. To the finger the first- mentioned tumor gave evidence of possessing a firm capsule ou its outer aud posterior side. To the ear was given a strong thrill and a loud humming bruit which swelled and subsided with tin- cardiac systole and diastole. The thrill was met with at the begining but not in the course of the jugular. It is presumed the instrument penetrated the temporo-maxillary veinB. B.

The internal jugular is probably, and both venae innominate are possibly distended. The cast was made by Prof. Christopher Johnston, M.

A cast of the head, showing deformity resulting from loss of the right superior maxillary, the right ala of the nose A. 2. and a part of the cheek and upper lip, resulting from gangrene probably caused by excessive and improper use of mercury. The margin of the opening consists, below, of the border of the lower lip, which is drawn upward and to the right, its extremity being adherent to the right malar bone; from this point to a point half an inch below the inner canthus of the right eye it is formed by the cicatrized margin of the cheek, and internally by the ridge and left ala of the nose and the left half of the upper lip. The right eye is destroyed and sunken, and the cartilaginous portions of the septum nasi is wanting. The palate bones and velum palati remain in situ. The right nasal fossa is freely opened and the lower turbinate bones are exposed. This deformity was subsequently remedied by a plastic operation. See specimens 4253, 4254, following.

A small quantity of composition, contents of a fire ball used by tbe Rebels and captured on Morris Island. Tlie a. 2. specimen is believed to be a mixture of nitre, sulpbur and antimony, and when used is made into a paste with sand and rosin. The missile was wrapped on the outside with three layers of heavy canvas, tarred and pitched without, with a net work of twine over it. The bottom was cast-iron covered only with pitch ; within the ball was a tin cup to which the canvas and twine were fastened, and which contained the composition, and near the base was embedded a 6-pouuder shell. Three pins in the top are withdrawn before loading in the gun, to allow ignition previous to its exit from the muzzle. The composition burns slowly with intense beat. The missile was designed to be thrown from a mortar. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon H. K. Neff. 2569. A bridge torpedo, McCallum's, designed to be placed in an auger hole in a beam, a. 3.

A hickory arrow, two feet in length, used by the Indians of Minnesota for killing small birds and by the boys for A. 1. practice. It is stained red and is quite blunt, being rectangular at the head. From Fort Ridgely. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Alfred Miiller. 4615. A hickory arrow, two feet in length, with the head drawn out spike-shaped and stained red. It is used for killing A. 2. the smaller birds and by the Indian boys for practice. From Fort Ridgely. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Alfred Miiller. 4443. A Yankton arrow, (Upper Sioux,) also used by the Lower Sioux. " In consequence of the constant intercourse of A. 3. the different tribes of the Lower and Upper Sioux Indians, no specific character is found in the arrows used by the several tribes, although the Yanktons and Sisitons (Upper Sioux) prepare theirs in preference with yellow colored feathers." The shaft is about twenty-two inches long and one-fourth of an inch in diameter. From about three inches from the extremity three irregular longitudinal grooves run down to the feathers. These grooves are possibly to permit the escape of blood, so that the wounded animal may be tracked. Beyond that they have no known significance. The feathered portion is between nine and ten inches. The arrow-head is of iron and spear-shaped, being in this specimen one inch broad at the base and nearly two inches long. The edges of the head are grooved and somewhat sharpened. The head is held in a cleft of the shaft by means of tendinous bands that loosen when long moistened by the blood of the stricken prey. Other arrow-heads used by the Sioux vary from this size to that of a breadth of five-eighths of an inch by a length of nearly four inches. For other illustrations, see seven succeeding specimens.

Note.—The number of specimens retained in the Surgical Section and described in this Catalogue is 4719. The discrepancy between this total and that given on page 3, Circular 6, Surgeon General's office, 1865, results from discarding many preparations of no intrinsic interest on account of imperfections in their histories.INDEX OF CONTRIBUTORS TO THE SURGICAL SECTION.

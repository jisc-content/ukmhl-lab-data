40 I. CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION 3685. A wet preparation of the lower part of the brain, the upper portion of which has been removed by a section b. 11. downward and backward, and is shown in specimen 357J, I. C. rs. b. 12. There is a large abscess in the left lobe of the cerebrum, resulting from a sabre wound of the head, which has opened into the left lateral ventricle, whence the pus has found its way into the other ventricles; the septum lucidum, velum interpositum, fornix and commissures of the thalamus having been broken down and partially removed. The cavity of the abscess contains two fluid ounces. The thalami optici and corpora striata appear normal. The cerebral substance of the walls of the abscess is softened and disintegrating. Private J. H., 27th Company, Second Battalion, Veteran Reserve Corps, 22: wounded by the guard, Washington, 23d January; died, 17th February, 1865. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon A. L. Stickney. See 3684, I. B. A. d. 2; 3571, I. C. B. b. 12. 3571. The upper and posterior portion of an abscess of the left lobe of the cerebrum, extending downward nearly to the b. 12. tentorium, which is slightly thickened and discolored. The result of a sabre wound. Private J. II., 27th Company, 2d Battalion, Veteran Reserve Corps, 22: wounded by the guard, Washington, 23d January; died, 17th February, 1865. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon A. L. Stickney. See 3684, I. B. A. d. 2; 3685, I. C. B. b. 11. 505. A wet preparation of a portion of the cerebrum with a partially organized coagulum in the substance of tin' b. 13. posterior lobe of the left hemisphere and in the cavity of the left ventricle. The clot is not recent, and tin- brain substance in the vicinity is firmly contracted around it. It is of a dark brownish-yellow color and spongy in texture, and measures one inch in diameter by one-fourth of an inch in thickness. On the surface of the brain there is a more recent clot, black in color and partially disorganized, measuring nearly the same as the first. K., company and regiment unknown: followed a fall on the occipital bone below the protuberance. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon C. G. Page. ll5'25. A wet preparation of a portion of the cerebrum, showing an abscess in the centre of the right hemisphere b. 14. communicating with the lateral ventricle, and externally with an opening in the dura mater, through which a hernia cerebri has taken place. The result of fracture with depression of the right parietal bone from gunshot. Patient lived five months. Three small fragments of the ball are impacted in the edge of the opening of the dura mater. The cavity of the abscess contains about two fluid ounces, and is lined by a pyogenic membrane having a filamentous surface. Corporal C. C, "G," 123d New York, 24: Chancellorsville, 3d May; admitted hospital, Alexandria, 13th Juue; died, 2d October, 1863. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon T. H. Stillwell. See 1724, I. A. B. b 28. 2166. The left half of the brain, perforated apparently by a musket ball, which has traversed the anterior lobe of the b. 15. cerebrum from side to side opening the lateral ventricle. Contributor and history unknown. 3221. A wet preparation of the brain and part of the dura mater five days after perforation by gunshot. A pistol ball b. 16. entered the left parietal near the posterior inferior angle, and passing transversely downward and forward perforated both hemispheres and lodged under the pia mater of the right side. The specimen shows extravasation of blood within the arachnoid. Pus was discharged from the wound of entrance and was found on the right side within the dura mater. J. A., (quadroon,) 21: Alexandria, 25th December; died, 30th December, 1865. Contributed by Surgeon E. Bentley, U. S. Vols. See 3220, I. A. B. d. 1. 498. A wet preparation of a portion of the cerebrum, exhibiting a softened condition of the anterior external portion of b. 17. the right hemisphere, following a clot induced by a fracture of the frontal bone four months before death. S. R., Negro, 35: admitted hospital, Washington, 30th October, 1865; died, from meningitis and abscess of right lung, 25th February, 1866. Contributed by Dr. S. S. Bond. See 419, I. B. C. d. 1. 2369. A wet preparation of a portion of the right cerebral hemisphere, exhibiting an abscess the size of a pigeon's b. 18. egg, situated under an incised wound of the right parietal bone inflicted three weeks previously. The abscess was filled with pus and broken-down brain tissue, and the covering membranes were thickened and adherent, rupturing on removal. The same patient received a gunshot wound of the orbit. E. B., freedman, 30: believed to have been wounded with au axe three weeks previously; died, Washington, 17th February, 1866. Contributed by Dr. S S. Bond. See 2321, I. B. B. c. 3; 2328, I.

Illustrating Plastic Operations. 349. A cast of the head and face, deformed as a result of gunshot wound of the chin and centre of the lower jaw five c. 1. months previously. The lower lip is cleft in the centre aud drawn downward and backward by a stellate cicatrix â– which occupies the place of the chin and of the anterior half of the body of the lower jaw on each side, including the symphysis. The angles of the mouth are drawn downward aud inward, making the shape of the oral aperture triangular. The anterior surface of the neck, the cicatrized portion of the chin aud the mouth are nearly on the same plane. A duplicate of this specimen in wax, without a number, is mounted by the side of it.

A cast of the lower part of the face, showing the result of a plastic operation performed eight months previously c. 2. for the relief of the deformity shown in the preceding specimen, 349. The cicatricial tissue has been removed and the lower lip brought back to its normal position. The scar of the incisions made for this purpose forms a Y inverted. The prominence of the chin is not restored, but there is no depression aud it curves forward from the plane of the anterior surface of the neck. Private J.

A cast of the face, deformed by cicatrices at the right side of the mouth, resulting from wound by a fragment of c. 3. shell. The right half of the under lip is drawn in beneath and behind the upper, being adherent to the body of the inferior maxilla. The upper lip is shortened by a band of cicatricial tissue which occupies the vermilion border and arches down across the right angle of the mouth, from which point it sends branches downward and outward, one of the latter extending nearly to the right angle of the lower jaw. The mouth could neither be freely opened nor entirely closed aud there was constant escape of saliva. The cast represents the condition just before a plastic operation for its relief by Dr. Gurdon Buck. Private E. H., " C," 6th Vermont, 22 : Winchester, 19th September, 1864.

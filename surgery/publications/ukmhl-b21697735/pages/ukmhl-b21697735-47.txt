Of the Bones. 4385, A cranium, probably of mixed Mexican and Indian blood, exhibiting on its vault a discolored area, light bluish- B. 1. gray, dotted with black points, six inches in length and varying from two to four in breadth. This surface is somewhat cribriform, and what appears to have been slight periosteal disturbance may be traced. The internal surface is perfectly normal. This condition is probably the result of scalping without immediate death following. The skull was picked up near the Lower Cimarron Springs, in the Comanche country, and contributed by Assistant Surgeon H. E. Brown, U. S. Army. See class I. C. A. b.

181 A. B. OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM. 488. The bones of the left forearm. The ulna has been fractured in the lowest third and a partial excision performed, d. 10. The history, which is obscure, represents an amputation in the upper third of the humerus to have been performed on the field. Private N. N. C, "E,"7th New York Heavy Artillery, 16: Petersburg, 18th June; amputated by Dr. A. Garcelon; admitted hospital, Washington, 28th June; died, 20th July, 1864. Contributed by the operator.

A wet preparation of the bones of the right forearm and interosseous membrane. The ulna is perfectly normal, a. 1. The inner border of the radius in the lowest third presents marks of circumscribed caries, both anteriorly and posteriorly, with thickening of the adjacent membrane, the probable result of gunshot contusion. Neither bone has been fractured, nor has any resection been performed. The specimen is chiefly interesting in being proof of the incorrectness of the statement that the forearm of the subject was so disabled that he could not commit physical violence with it. Captain H. W. (Rebel): hanged, Washington, 10th November, 1865. Contributed by Assistant Surgeons W. Thomson and H. Allen, U. S. Army. See 300, III. B. A. a. 1 ; 299, XIX. B. A. a. 1 ; 301, XXII. B. A. c. 1; 302, XXII. B. a. c. 3. 1387. The bones of the left forearm with a conoidal carbine ball attached. The missile entered two inches above the a. 2. wrist and was extracted, two weeks afterward, just below the elbow on the external aspect of the arm. Both bones are somewhat roughened on their adjoining faces by the superficial necrosis which has followed their contusion and by the dissection of periosteum by pus. The bullet is somewhat grooved. Private A. C, "C," 8th Illiuois Cavalry, 27: Upperville, Va., 21st June; admitted hospital, Washington, 23d June; amputated for secondary haemorrhage by Acting Assistant Surgeon McCoy, 9th July; died, 11th July, 1863. Contributed by the operator. See 1386, XVIII. II. A. B. c. 2. See class XXVII. B. B. d. 3674. The bones of the left forearm, necrosed in their greatest extent The radius was partially fractured in its lowest a. 3. third, and the ulna was probably contused. The lower portions of the specimen, which are not necrosed, are discolored superficially, as if in the treatment. (The cause of the discoloration is obscure.) Private J. C. T., "B," 17th Pennsylvania Cavalry: Trevillian Station, Va , 2d June; admitted hospital, Philadelphia, 29th; wrist disarticulated for gangrene; arm amputated in the lowest third by Acting Assistant Surgeon M. K. Know, 20th September; died from pyaemia, 17th October, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon Lewis Taylor, U. S. Army. See class IX. A. B. e. 1865. Four and a half inches of the shaft of the ulna, showing a consolidated gunshot fracture. The bone was not a. 4. broken in its entire thickness, a splinter one-fourth of an inch remaining intact. A fragment of about the same diameter and a little more than an inch in length has been fixed by new bone parallel with it. Other small fragments have been consolidated above and below it. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. Leidy. For other illustrations, see 2017, VII. A. B. c. 3. b. Complete Fractures. 923. b. 1. The bones of the left forearm. The radius is shattered in the lowest fourth of the shaft, as if by a musket, ball. Amputation was performed in the arm. The bone at the seat of fracture shows traces of treatment for gangrene.

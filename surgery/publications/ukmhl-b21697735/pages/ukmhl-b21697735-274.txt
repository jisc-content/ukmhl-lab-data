See class XXVII. B. B. d. 3955. A portion of the shaft of the right femur, showing an oblique fracture with comminution from a conoidal ball at b. 65. the junction of the lower thirds. There is marked loss of substance with some callus effused, but no union accomplished. Corporal L. P., "F," 60th Georgia, (Rebel,) 41: Monocacy Junction, Md., 9th July; died from exhaustion, Frederick, 12th September, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon T. E. Mitchell. 1970. The lower portion of the left femur, fractured at the junction of the lower thirds by a conoidal ball. The b. 66. extremities slightly lap, but the deposit of callus is insignificant. Private W. F. D., "I," 16th North Carolina, (Rebel,) 30: Gettysburg, 1st July; died from exhaustion, 13th October, 1863. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon E. A. Koepner. 3335. The lower half of the right femur, badly comminuted at the junction of the lower thirds. The fragments are b. 67. tolerably well enveloped and fixed by callus in irregular positions, but no union of the shaft occurred. Private W. T., "C," 76th New York: Wilderness, 5th May; admitted hospital, Alexandria, 14th June; died from exhaustion, 24th July, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon E. Bentlcy, U. S. Vols. 1030. The left femur, badly comminuted in the middle third, with the fragments, some of which are necrosed, enveloped b. 68. in much spongy callus. A moderate degree of union had occurred, which was destroyed in preparing the specimen. Private T. J. L., 2d Texas, (Rebel,) 17: Shiloh, 7th April; admitted hospital, Cincinnati, 18th April; died from exhaustion, 7th July, 1862. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. H. Murphy. 2684. The greater portion of the shaft of the left femur, fractured in the middle third by gunshot. In life the fragments b. 69. overlapped four inches The extremities were necrosed and a certain amount of callus retained the spicule without causing union. Private E. B B., "A," 5th New Jersey, 45: admitted hospital, Washington, 26th May; died from exhaustion. 25th June, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon A. Ansell. 1013. The left femur, showing the formation of an immense sequestrum in the lower half, following fracture of the b. 70. middle third. This subject was admitted to hospital, six weeks after the injury, with what was considered to be a partial fracture from a musket ball (probably round) at short range. There was neither shortening, crepitus, nor any considerable discharge, and consolidation seemed to have occurred. The pus, however, appeared mixed with some disorganized bone. Nearly four months after the injury the femur was again broken by an accidental fall, and no reparative action could be established. The specimen shows disease of the whole lower two-thirds of the shaft.

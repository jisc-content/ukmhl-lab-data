262 CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION XIII. b. Complete Fractures. 997. The lower portion of the left femur, fractured obliquely downward by the impact of a conoidal bullet in the b. 1. middle third, apparently from above. The specimen very well shows how several lines of fracture may proceed in the same general direction after injury by such missiles. Contributed by Surgeon J. T. Calhoun, 5th Excelsior (New York Volunteers). 2116. The lowest third of the right femur, partially fractured, as if by a fragment of shell, two inches above the condyles, b. 2. with a complete oblique fracture extending seven inches above the joint. There was neither mobility, crepitus, nor pain, and the fracture was not detected during life. Private W. B., "E," 14th Connecticut: Morton's Ford, Gth February ; died of tetanus in hospital First Division, Second Corps, 12th February, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon W. W. Potter, 57th New York. 4081. The lowest third of the right femur, obliquely fractured, with slight comminution, by a pistol ball. The b. 3. popliteal artery was wounded by a spicula of bone, and death from mortification followed the ligation of the femoral below the profunda for secondary h:emorrhage. First Lieutenant A. M. P>., "A," 26th Virginia (Rebel): Burk's Station, Va., 5th April; secondary haemorrhage and ligation of the femoral, City Point, 17th; died, Washington, 20th April, 1865. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon G. K. Smith. See 4085, XVIII. II. A. B. b. 36; 554, Urino-Genital Organs— Medical Series. 1571. The lower half of the right femur. A conoidal ball entered the posterior aspect two inches above the joint, b. 4. cleanly cutting the laminated structure. From this point an oblique fracture extends five inches up the shaft, which thus far is shattered. On the anterior surface the bone is broken one and a half inches interiorly. Contributor and history unknown. 1§25. The lower third of the left femur, obliquely fractured, with much comminution, by a conoidal ball which b. 5. remained, greatly contorted, in the popliteal space. Private A. C, " K," 6th Maine: Rappahannock Station, Va., 7th November; admitted hospital, Washington, 9th; died, 20th November, 1863. Contributed by Surgeon John A. Lidell, U. S. Vols. See elass XXVII.

McArthur. See class XXVII. B. is. d. 2397. The lower half of the left femur. The shaft is transversely fractured, with comminution upward, in the lowest b. 8. third, and the necrosed bone near the fracture is bordered by commencing lines of separation. Private R.

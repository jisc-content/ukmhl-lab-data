A wet preparation of the left common, external and internal carotid arteries, the last of which was wounded and a. 3. is impermeable. Private L. E., 22: a bullet entered his open mouth, passed through the middle of the left anterior pillar of the fauces and escaped through the back of the neck, two inches from the spinous process of the second cervical vertebra on the same side, causing profuse haemorrhage followed by syncope for several hours, Antietam, 17th September; doing well until two slight arterial haemorrhages occurred, Frederick, 31st October and 2d November; paralysis left side of the face, 13th November; died, 14th November, 1862. Injection of the carotid arteries revealed the left internal closed, after two and a half inches, by an organized cul dc sac, its distal termination and its branches being undiscovered. It appears the bullet laid open the internal carotid, and a coagulum, sufficient to arrest further haemorrhage, was formed while fainting, and the remainder of the artery was disintegrated and carried away by suppuration. The succeeding haemorrhages may have occurred from minute openings in the external carotid occuning spontaneously and arrested in like manner. (See Am. Jour. Med. Sci. January, 1863, pp. 79-80.)

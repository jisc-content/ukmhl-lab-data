XIII. CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION 270 2182. The left femur, fractured at the junction of the middle and lower thirds by a b. 79. conoidal ball. A large amount of callus has been thrown out, connecting by arches the extremities, which were not in juxtaposition. Shortening by several inches, with lateral deformity, has occurred Tubercular deposits were found in the lungs. This case is remarkable for the length of time involved. A more favorable result might have been secured if better adaptation had been made. See figure, 90. Private J. F. D., "D,"6th Kentucky (Rebel): Stone River, 30th December, 1862; reached Nashville, 4th April, 1863; died, 17th February, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon R. T. Higgins. 1946. The left femur, comminuted in the middle third by a conoidal ball. An irregu- b. 80. lar deposit of callus, giving rise to partial union, has imprisoned the fragments of dead bone. There is much shortening and deformity. The whole appears to have been bathed in pus before death. Private J. L., " C," 2d Mississippi, (Rebel,) 24: Gettysburg, 3d July ; died from exhaus- tion, 5th October, 1863. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon E. P. Townsend. 2177. A portion of the right femur, fractured in the middle third. The extremities b. 81. are not in apposition, but firm union occurred from a very large deposit of callus. A few small sequestra remain, and sinuses lead down to the necrosed bone. The lower half of the shaft is deprived of periosteum. Private J. F. P., "C," 6th Indiana: Chickamauga, 20th September, 1863; admitted hospital, Nashville, from Chattanooga, 22d January; died, 6th February, 1864. Was doing well at Chattanooga and " his condition was not improved by the transit." Contributed by Surgeon J. W. Foye, U. S. Vols. 1354. The left femur, six months after injury. The bone is fractured in the middle b. 82. third by a conoidal ball. It has firmly united with three-fourths of an inch shortening and a little lateral displacement. The large fragments that were split off occupy the place of splints held by the callus. The point of fracture shows portions of dead bone not yet thrown off. The case at one time was looked upon as a cure, so slight was the discharge and so firm the union. The upper half of the shaft has been sawn open longitudinally. Private J. W., "F," 21st Georgia (Eebel): Petersburg, 25th March; admitted hospital, Washington, 10th April; photo- graphed as recovered, 15th August; died from osteo-myelitis, 23d September, 1665.

The right femur, fractured by a conoidal ball in the middle third and united with anterior displacement and three b. 83. and a half inches shortening. In the involucrum of the upper fragment is imprisoned an original fragment necrosed. The entire shaft lost its periosteum and the head of the femur its articular cartilage. Corporal S. H., "B," 4th Ehode Island, 31: Antietam, 17th September, 1862; treated in the field without splints and union occurred in about two months; erysipelas set in, 1st April; admitted hospital, Frederick, 20th May; thigh filled with abscesses, hip joint became involved and subject died, 11th June, 1863. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. C. Shimer. See classes XII. A. B. c; XXIII. A. a. 3877. The shaft of the left femur, fractured in the middle third by a conoidal ball. There is firm union with some b. 84. displacement and two inches shortening; several of the original fragments are firmly bound as splints. The whole shaft is eroded. Private J. G. E., "H," 14th U. S. Infantry: Antietam, 17th September, 1862; died from erysipelas and exhaustion, 27th March, 1863 Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. C. Shinier. See class XXIII. A. a. 3884. The upper half of the right femur, seven months after fracture at the junction of the upper thirds, united by four b. 85. bridges. The specimen shows several of the large original fragments attached by callus and assisting in the consolidation. Corporal P. K. W., "E," 2d Georgia, (Rebel,) 28: conoidal ball, Antietam, 17th September, 1862: doing well until roughly driven in an ambulance, Frederick, 12th March; erysipelas appeared, 17th March; the knee became greatly and the hip Miiihtiy involved, and death from exhaustion occurred, 22d April, 18t!3.

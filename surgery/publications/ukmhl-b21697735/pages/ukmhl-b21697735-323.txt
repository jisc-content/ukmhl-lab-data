The lowest fourth of the left femur, obliquely fractured just above the joint, with a small conoidal pistol ball e. 16. lodged in the anterior surface. This bullet is reported to have entered near the tuberosity of the tibia, passed through the joint and lodged, while in the act of escaping, above and between the condyles. The missile has rotated upon its long axis and presents its base to view. A more probable hypothesis is that the pistol ball as seen is a second and inde- pendent missile partly penetrating.

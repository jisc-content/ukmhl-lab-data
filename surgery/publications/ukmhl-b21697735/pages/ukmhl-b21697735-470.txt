4G4 XVIII. II. CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M. Dean. 2611. A wet preparation of the anterior tibial artery, ligated above and below a point of sloughing for secondary b. 43. haemorrhage, after hospital gangrene following a resection in the shaft of the left fibula. Private E. H. B., "K," 1st Michigan Cavalry, 39: fibula fractured, Gettysburg, 3d July; excision performed at Cavalry Corps Hospital; admitted hospital, Philadelphia, 8th September; hospital gangrene occurred, 18th; secondary haemorrhage to the extent of three pints, operation and death, l>th October, 1863. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. H. Jamar. WO I. A wet preparation of the, internal iliac artery, ligated for secondary haemorrhage, b. 44. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon W. W. Keen, jr. 2481. A wet preparation of the common carotid artery, ligated one inch below the bifurcation, with the formation of a b. 45. clot on the cranial aspect. The external carotid is pierced by a pin, the presence of which is unexplained. Private J. R. "B," 63d New York: inferior maxilla fractured, Wilderness, 5th May; admitted hospital, Wash- ington, 13th; carotid ligated, 31st May; died, 1st June, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon G L. Pancoast, U. S. Vols. See 2482, II. A. B. b. 7. 807. A preparation of the femoral artery, after ligation in its continuity, as if for secondary haemorrhage. An extensive b. 46. solution of its coats appears an inch and a half below the point of operation. Above and below the ligature, which has nearly ulcerated through the artery, firm clots have formed. Contributor and history unknown. OOG. A portion of a small artery, accompanied by the veins. It has been opened by ulceration near one extremity, b. 47. A memorandum describes it as ligated, but the point of operation is not discernable. Contributed by Surgeon D. W. Bliss, U. S. Vols. 1004. A small section of the femoral and profunda arteries, after ligation. A clot, plugging the femoral, is exposed b. 48. where the artery has been cut through by a ligature. Another ligature remains on the profunda at its origin, where also a clot lias been formed. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon G. F. Shrady. 2220. An arterial preparation, received without history. It is believed to be the femoral artery, ligated just below the b. 49. origin of the anastomotica magna, (where it narrows more rapidly than is common,) which, in this case, arises very near to the profunda. The .chief point of interest in the specimen is this peculiar origin. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. Leidy. See class XVIII. II. D. 2225. A wet preparation of an artery, with no history. The specimen appears to be the brachial cut thiough by a b. 50. ligature just above the bifurcation. An opening in its walls below the anastomotica magna may have been the cause of death. A ligature is loosely placed about the vessel in the middle of its course, as if to indicate where the second operation should have been performed. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon W. W. Keen, jr. 2384. An arterial preparation, apparently of the external iliac, ligated just below the episgastric, which, in the specimen, b. 5 1. has been cut off close to the main trunk. Contributor and history unknown. 500. A wet preparation of a portion of the femoral artery, showing a false aneurism, the size of a walnut, following b. 52. gunshot. Second Lieutenant R. W. S., "I," 5th Pennsylvania Reserves: Second Bull Run, 30th August, admitted hospital, Washington, 5th September; artery reported ligated, 7th; died, 8th September, 1862.

K., "E," 40th New York, 29: fracture of elbow, and arm amputated middle third, Wilderness; admitted hospital, Washington, 26th May; death from secondary haemorrhage, 26th June, 1864.

It is stained red and is quite blunt, being rectangular at the head. From Fort Ridgely. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Alfred Miiller. 4615. A hickory arrow, two feet in length, with the head drawn out spike-shaped and stained red. It is used for killing A. 2. the smaller birds and by the Indian boys for practice. From Fort Ridgely. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Alfred Miiller. 4443. A Yankton arrow, (Upper Sioux,) also used by the Lower Sioux. " In consequence of the constant intercourse of A. 3. the different tribes of the Lower and Upper Sioux Indians, no specific character is found in the arrows used by the several tribes, although the Yanktons and Sisitons (Upper Sioux) prepare theirs in preference with yellow colored feathers." The shaft is about twenty-two inches long and one-fourth of an inch in diameter. From about three inches from the extremity three irregular longitudinal grooves run down to the feathers. These grooves are possibly to permit the escape of blood, so that the wounded animal may be tracked. Beyond that they have no known significance. The feathered portion is between nine and ten inches. The arrow-head is of iron and spear-shaped, being in this specimen one inch broad at the base and nearly two inches long. The edges of the head are grooved and somewhat sharpened. The head is held in a cleft of the shaft by means of tendinous bands that loosen when long moistened by the blood of the stricken prey. Other arrow-heads used by the Sioux vary from this size to that of a breadth of five-eighths of an inch by a length of nearly four inches. For other illustrations, see seven succeeding specimens.

OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM. 537 A. B. 4026. A cast of the right elbow, nearly three years after the excision of a number of fragments. An irregular transverse a. 9. cicatrix extends across the dorsal surface just below the articulation. The joint is anchylosed and in a semi-flexed position, but is perfectly strong and otherwise useful. Private E. T. P., "E,"'2d New Hampshire : Gettysburg, 2d July ; excised, Baltimore, October, 1863; transferred to Veteran Reserve Corps, 8th March, 1864 ; cast made at Army Medical Museum, where subject was on duty, July, 1866. Contributed by Hospital Steward E. F. Schafhirt, U. S. Army. 2431. A plaster cast, showing the result of the primary removal of a portion of the left humerus six months after fracture, a. 10. Upon the outer surface of the arm, near the junction of the upper and middle thirds, is a small nipple-like protuberance, as if of granulations enclosing a sinus. No cicatrix of incision is apparent, and the operation probably consisted in the removal of fragments. The arm is nearly normal in appearance, but slightly atrophied. Corporal E. M. B., "H," 8th New York Cavalry, 19: Five Forks, Va., 1st April; admitted hospital, Albany, 11th July; transferred, 28th October, 1865. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. H. Armsby, U. S. Vols. 289. A cast of the right thorax and arm, showing the result sixteen months after primary excision of three inches of a. 11. the shaft of the humerus at the junction of the upper thirds. The cicatrix, an inch and a half in length, is three- fourths of an inch deep. The arm is somewhat atrophied at that point and osseous union does not appear to have occurred. Private A. J., " F," 112th New York, 24: Cold Harbor, 3d June, 1864 ; cast made in Albany; discharged, 21st October, 1864. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. H. Armsby, U. S. Vols. 2433. A cast of the left thorax and arm, ten months after a primary excision of three inches of the upper third of the a. 12. shaft of the humerus. The bullet appears to have entered posteriorly two inches below the summit of the shoulder, and to have passed out anteriorly just above the outer fold of the axilla. The incision is six inches in length and the cicatrix broad and irregular. The arm is somewhat atrophied at the junction of the upper thirds. It is not known whether union occurred. First Sergeant J. H. P., "F," 142d New York, 23: Darbytown Road, Va., 27th October, 1864; cast made in Albany; discharged the service, 22d September, 1865. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. H. Armsby, U. S. Vols. 1805. A cast showing the result of excision of three inches of the shaft of the right humerus fractured by gunshot, a. 13. The cicatrix of the incision through the soft parts is on the middle of the posterior surface of the arm and is four inches in length. The arm is slightly curved, the concavity being in front and within, and is smaller in the centre, the muscles about the shoulder and elbow retaining their fulness, which give the limb a somewhat dumb-bell-shaped appearance. It is doubtful whether union has occurred. Private C. A. P., "K," 60th New York, 21: wounded and excised, Atlanta, Ga., 25th July, 1864 ; cast made in Albany, July, 1865; mustered out of service, 31st August, 1865. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. H. Armsby, U. S. Vols. 4381. A cast showing the result of fracture of the left elbow and primary excision of three and a half inches of the a. 14. humerus at the lowest third. There is a deep irregular cicatrix on the outer side of the elbow. The arm is shortened one and three-fourths inches. The functions of the hand and forearm are well performed. Sergeant G. C. G., "F," 32d Massachusetts : Cold Harbor, 30th May, 1864 ; excision-apparatus applied, 11th August, 1865. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Geo. F. Shrady. 2845. A cast of the right arm, showing the result of primary excision in the upper part of the humerus. The head and a. 15. about four inches of the shaft appear to have been removed. A broad, nearly straight cicatrix on the posterior surface of the arm embraces the wound of exit. A small cicatrix on the anterior surface involves the wound of entrance. The comminuted bone has evidently been removed through enlargement of the wounds caused by the missiles. There appears to be no bony union at the seat of the operation. The shoulder is moderately full. Private S. C. A., "B," 93d New York: Spottsylvania, 10th May; cast made in Albany; discharged the service, 30th May, 1864. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. H. Armsby, U. S. Vols. 1480. A cast of the left arm, four months after an excision of four inches of the shaft of the humerus, including fragments, a. 16. for fracture by a conoidal ball. The incision was straight and five inches in length, commencing two inches below the acromion. The cast represents the cicatrix broad and somewhat irregular, with what appears a sinus at the lower extremity. The arm is shortened one inch. Sergeant J. S. P., " G," 14th Virginia Cavalry, 25 : Monocacy, 9th July ; excised by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. Dunott, 12th July; transferred to Baltimore, 10th December, 1864.

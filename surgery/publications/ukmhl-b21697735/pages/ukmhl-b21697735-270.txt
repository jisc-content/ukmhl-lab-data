The lower half of the right femur, splintered in the lowest third and partially united, without adaptation, by arches b. 23. of callus which imprison the larger fragments, whose vitality is well retained.

Gaff. 63. The lower half of the right femur, obliquely fractured, with comminution, in the lowest third. A considerable b. 24. deposit of callus, which imprisoned several fragments, produced very partial union with shortening and displace- ment. A large extent of the upper fragment is deprived of periosteum. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. C. McKee, U. S. Army. 311. The lower portion of the left femur, fractured obliquely with loss of substance. Above the condyles a line of b. 25. necrosis is established around the upper extremity, with the deposit of some callus above it. A small quantity is also effused on the lower border. Several of the larger fragments which remain are coated on their periosteal surfaces. Contributed by Surgeon B. A. Vanderkieft. 1323. The lower half of the left femur. The shaft was obliquely fractured, with some comminution, in the lowest fourth, b. 26.

Â¥68. The lower half of the left femur, extensively fractured in the lowest third. The specimen beautifully exhibits b. 27. the action of necrosis along the borders of the fragments and the deposits of osseous matter on the adjoining limits. Private H.

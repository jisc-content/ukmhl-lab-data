Died without an operation. Contributed by Surgeon T. H. Squire, 89th New York. 3188. The bones of the right knee, with the patella and external condyle shattered. Suppuration appears to have b. 55. eroded the articular surfaces. Private A. J. W., "II," 2d Virginia Cavalry, (Rebel,) 22: admitted hospital, Baltimore, 30th July; died of pyaemia, 17th August, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon B. B. Miles, Curator Jarvis Hospital. 1156. The lower half of the right femur, exhibiting extensive longitudinal fractures. The articulation is split in the b. 56. centre and the fracture ends obliquely in the middle of the bone. There is no history, but the specimen presents the appearance of an old subject struck by a fragment of shell in the lowest fourth, crushing in the laminated portion. Contributor unknown. 1010. The bones of the right knee. The internal condyle is perforated and the external splintered on the posterior aspect b. 57. by a bullet passing obliquely from side to side. Contributor and history unknown. 1404. The bones of the right knee, nearly one year after injury. A conoidal ball lodged in the internal condyle from b. 58. above. There is some deposit of callus around and caries in the course of its passage. The articular surfaces of the femur and tibia are eroded, and the knee was anchylosed in a nearly straight position when admitted to hospital. The patella is attached to the external condyle by bony union. The subject was a mulatto of scrofulous diathesis. Private T. B., " C," 110th U. S. Colored Troops, 18: Athens, Ala., 25th September, 1864; admitted hospital, Mobile, 4th August; died from exhaustion following suppuration and chronic diarrhoea, 7th September, 1865.

K., "E," 7th Michigan Cavalry: wounded by a conoidal carbine ball, which entered the front of the thigh at its middle and, passing downward and inward, lodged beneath the integument on the inner side of the joint, on picket, Chautilly, Va., 19th June; admitted hospital, Washington, 26th ; bullet easily extracted from its superficial position, with no indication that the joint was involved, 27 th June; some inflammation noticed, 2d July; erysipelas set in, 5th; died, 18th July, 1863. The fracture of the bone was first discovered post mortem, and the case well illustrates the obscurity of symptoms and difficulty of diagnosis which may attend a serious gunshot injury of an articulation so easy of general examination as the knee.

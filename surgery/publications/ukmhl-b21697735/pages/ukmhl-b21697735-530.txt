The left upper extremity, amputated in the highest third of the arm for disease following an old burn. An ulcer F. 3. at the inner aspect of the bend of the elbow covers a length of six inches with an average width of five inches. The brachial artery is occluded, and the diseased surface steadily increased, possibly on account of deficient vascular supply. The ulcer, which had existed for four years resisting all treatment, was very painful, and had involved the olecranon in superficial necrosis. At the time of operation the constitutional condition was bad and abscesses existed in the axilla. A portion of the ulcerated tissue was included in the flap. S.

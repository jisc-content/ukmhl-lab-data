CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION 276 XIII. 2948. The upper half of the left femur, with an oblique, nearly longitudinal fracture, curiously curved. A fragment of b. 136. bullet is embedded at a contused spot on the outer aspect below the trochanters, from which a deep fissure extends downward joining the fracture. Another point of contusion appears on the anterior face at the summit of the frac- ture. A few pieces of bone are in process of separation and a fringe of callus borders the fracture. Private J. T., "E,"24th Massachusetts, 34: Petersburg, 17th June; died, Washington, 31st July, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon E. Bentley, U. S. Vols. 659. A portion of the right femur, much shattered in the upper third. There is slight effusion of callus, but a fracture b. 137. in one of the large fragments beautifully illustrates union with exact apposition. Private D. T. B., " K," 53d Pennsylvania, 25 : Fredericksburg, 13th December; admitted hospital, Washington, 26th December, 1862; died, 4th February, 1863. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon W. H. Ensign. 769. The greater portion of the left femur, with a very long oblique fracture through the upper third, caused by around b. 138. ball piercing the bone, and probably aggravated by the subject falling from his horse. The extremities are somewhat carious, and a slight deposit of callus partially bound the fragments during life. Extensive abscesses occupied the thigh. Private R. M. B., 2d South Carolina Cavalry, (Rebel,) 28: Frederick, 14th September; died from exhaustion, 7th Novem- ber, 1862. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon W. W. Keen, jr. Sec 892, XXII. A. B. a. 9.

One large fragment b. 140. is covered with a layer of soft callus, as are the borders of the others beyond the limits of the portions that are about being thrown off. Corporal J. Mcl., "E," 20th Massachusetts : Fredericksburg, 14th December, 1862. Contributed by Medical Cadet Kingston. 1325. A portion of the femur, fractured in the upper third by a musket ball.

Two large b. 143. fragments of bone remain at the seat of fracture. Avery slight effusion of callus has occurred, and the shaft forms an obtuse angle with the neck, from the action of the adductors. Contributed without history by Surgeon D. W. Bliss, U. S. Vols. 729. Half of the right femur, comminuted in the upper third. Much of the broken bone is necrosed, and beyond the b. 144. line of death indifferent deposits of callus appear. The point of impact is on the outer surface, where fragments of lead yet remain.

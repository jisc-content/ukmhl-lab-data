A. A. OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM. 255 4133. The lowest third of the left femur, partially fractured by a conoidal ball embedding itself anteriorly and producing d. 4. a longitudinal fracture. Corporal P.

B. n. d. 1362. The lowest third of the left femur, primarily amputated for shattering of the anterior surface by a conoidal ball d. 5. impinging above the joint and comminuting upward without completely fracturing the shaft. The battered ball is attached. Private J. F., "E," 52d New York. Contributed by Surgeon J. M. Homiston, New York Cavalry. See classes XIII. A. A. a.; XXVII. B. B. d. 4179. The lowest third of the left femur, obliquely fractured by a fragment of shell, which has crushed in tin- laminated d. 6. structure on the anterior surface and is attached to the specimen. A probable primary amputation. Eeceived from the Army of the Potomac. See class XXVII. B. a. c. 1886. The lowest third of the left femur, with a very extensively comminuted oblique fracture by a conoidal ball d. 7. (attached) which perforated the shaft from without inward. Z. T. C, "E," 60th Georgia (Rebel): Milton's Mills. Va., 27th November; amputated by Surgeon J. Dwindle, 106th Pennsylvania, 28th November; sent to General Hospital, 4th December, 1863. Contributed by the operator. See 1885, XIII. A. A. d. 23. See class XXVII. B. B. d. 2158. The lowest third of the left femur, perforated by a conoidal ball from behind, three inches above the condyles, d. 8. with the shaft thoroughly comminuted. Primary amputation was probably performed. History unknown. Contributed by Surgeon G. W. McMillin, 5th East Tennessee. 1397. The lowest third of the left femur, amputated for complete fracture, with shattering in the middle of the specimen, d. 9. Lieutenant F. H.

Received from the Army of the Potomac. 1369. The lowest third of the right femur, after amputation in the upper part of the lowest third for extensive and d. 10. oblique shattering by a conoidal ball which entered four inches above the joint. Private J. L., "I," 89th Pennsylvania, 40: Monocacy, 9th July; amputated by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. II. Bartholf, Frederick, Md., 11th July, 1864; died from softening of the brain, 14th February, 1865. Contributed by the operator. 1413. The lower half of the right femur, transversely fractured in the middle third by a conoidal ball, which is attached, d. 11. flattened. A very small portion of the laminated structure is wanting at the point of impact on the outer surface, and directly opposite a longitudinal fissure extends into both fragments. Primary amputation has probably been performed. This specimen illustrates how little injury to the bone sometimes accompanies great change of shape in the missile. This bullet struck, with its long diameter parallel to that of the bone, when it was heated. Contributed by Surgeon C. S. Wood, 66th New York. See class XXVII. B. B. d. 3225. The lower half of the left femur, with an oblique fracture extending upward for seven inches from the base of the d. 12. shaft at its outer posterior angle. The laminated structure is wanting for the diameter of an inch at the point of impact. From the character of the fracture the direction of the bullet appears to have been from below. Private D. L., "I," 1st Maine Heavy Artillery: probably Spottsylvania; amputated in the field by Surgeon J. W. Lyman, 57th Pennsylvania; died, May, 1864. Contributed by the operator. 2043. The left femur, amputated a little above the junction of the lower thirds for an extensive oblique fracture from d. 13. a conoidal ball impacted posteriorly at the base of the shaft. The line of flight of the ball seems to have been a little upward, and the fracturing is entirely in that direction. Private E. B., "H," 39th New York, 29: Morton's Ford, Va., 6th February : amputated by Surgeon J. Dwindle, 106th Pennsylvania, Second Corps Hospital, 8th February; discharged the service, 1st June, 1864.

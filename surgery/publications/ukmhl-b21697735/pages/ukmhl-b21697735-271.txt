This specimen exhibits a fragment four inches long by one and a half wide which has preserved the vitality of its periosteal surface, by whose effusions it connects, as a bridge, the broken shaft; but the internal surface of the fragment is carious. There are other and smaller fragments entangled in the newly formed bone, some of which are necrosed and some serve as bonds. A battered fragment of lead is attached.

Contributor and history unknown. 2486. The shaft of the left femur, comminuted in the middle third by a conoidal ball with extensive longitudinal b. 39. fracture. The greater portion of the specimen is superficially necrosed. Private T. H., "D," 1st Michigan Sharpshooters, 20: Spottsylvania C.

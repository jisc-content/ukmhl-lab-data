OF THE UNITED STATES AEMY MEDICAL MUSEUM. 263 A. B. 2126. The upper portions of the right tibia and fibula, and the lower half of the femur. The femur is shattered in b. 11. the lowest third, with marked necrosis and moderate callus. The knee was secondarily involved. Private W. H.

Contributor and history unknown. 74:7. The lowest third of the right femur, obliquely fractured, with comminution, four inches above the knee. A consider- b. 13. able effusion of callus has united the fragments with the upper portion, but no union of the extremities has occurred. Private A.

A portion of the left femur, obliquely fractured in the lowest third with some comminution. There is a small b. 17. quantity of callus on the upper border, but no union nor displacement of the osseous tissue is present. The history states that the patient died from diarrhoea, "the parts around the fracture were apparently healthy," " the fragments were apparently united by ligamentous union," and the injured limb " was two inches shorter than the other."

The lower half of the right femur, badly comminuted above the condyles by a conoidal ball. The limb was b. 18. attempted to be saved, and the effort of nature to throw off the necrosed bone is distinctly marked. A trivial deposit of callus was made. A spicula of bone was found piercing the femoral, and an abscess occupied the limb without involving the knee. Private J. J.

A section of the right femur, fractured in the lowest third. A considerable amount of callus has been deposited, b. 21. imprisoning the necrosed fragments, but not uniting the extremities. An excision of fragments appears to have been made. Contributed by Surgeon J. A. Lidell, U. S. Vols. See class XIII. A. B. e.

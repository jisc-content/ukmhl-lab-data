Complete Fractures. 2446. The lower half of the right humerus, transversely fractured in the lowest third, as it is said, by gunshot. A b. 1. fissure, but no comminution, extends for two inches on the posterior surface of the upper extremity. Keceived after Chancellorsville. 250. The lower half of the right humerus, transversely fractured near the junction of the lower thirds by a conoidal b. 2. ball, which is attached. Contributed by Surgeon J. H. Brinton, U. S. Vols. See class XXVII. B. n. d. 682. The right humerus, transversely fractured by gunshot in the middle third, and slightly chipped at the point b. 3. of impact on the anterior face, with several extensive and carious longitudinal fissures for several inches up and down the shaft. Contributed by Dr. S. Perry. 2412. The lower two-thirds of the right humerus, exhibiting two distinct and non-communicating fractures. The lower b. 4. one, just above the condyles, is nearly transverse, with slight comminution. The upper is at the junction of the lower thirds, oblique, without comminution, and crossed on the posterior surface of the shaft by a longitudinal fissure four and a half inches iu length. There is no history for this case, but the injuries appear to have been caused by the simultaneous impingment of two missiles, possibly fragments of shell, on the posterior surface. Keceived after Chancellorsville. 1500. The lower half of the right humerus, fractured in the lowest third. The point of interest in this specimen is b. 5. the manner iu which the trabecule are displayed by the fracture. Contributed by Surgeon J. H. Brinton, U. S. Vols. 2525. The lower half of the left humerus, fractured in the lowest third. This specimen beautifully exhibits the b. 6. trabecule at that portion of the shaft where it takes upon itself the form of a flat bone. Eeceived after Chancellorsville. 1221. The lowest fourth of the left humerus, the shaft shattered by shell. b. 7. Eeceived, without history, from the fight at Beverly Ford, 9th June, 1863. 538. The upper half of the left humerus, badly fractured, with little displacement, as if by a conoidal ball, b. 8. Contributed by Surgeon McDonald, 79th New York. 3136. The lower half of the left humerus, transversely fractured one inch above the condyles, with an irregular b. 9. triangular fragment four inches in length broken off from the upper portion. A fragment of shell is attached. Received, without history, from City Point. See class XXVII. B. a. c.

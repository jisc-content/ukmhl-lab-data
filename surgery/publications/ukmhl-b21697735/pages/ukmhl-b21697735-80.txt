IV. 74 CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION 3638. The left scapula, with the coracoid process fractured at its junction with the neck. There is no effort at repair, b. 9. A fracture which exists at the inferior angle probably occurred in the preparation of the specimen. Private G. W., "E," 96th New York, 24: Cedar Creek, 19th October; admitted hospital, Philadelphia, 26th; died, exhausted, with pyremie symptoms, 30th October, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon A. A. Smith. See 3722, VI. A. B. b. 33. 579. The lowest fourth of the right scapula, which is perforated by a conoidal ball near the inferior angle. The bone is b. 10. neither comminuted nor fissured. The edges of the orifice are slightly necrosed. Private S. B., "A," 83d New York: Fredericksburg, 13th December; admitted hospital, Washington, 26th December, 1862 ; pleuro-pneumonia of the left side occurred, 18th January; died, 21st January, 1863. Contributed by Surgeon II. Bryant, U. S. Vols. See 846, XIX. A. B. a. 32 ; 515, XIX. A. B a. 33. 2792. The right scapula fractured on the anterior border near the inferior angle, by a ball which entered the front over b. 11. the third rib and passed round the chest escaping as seen in the specimen. The fractured edges are necrosed, and both surfaces of the lower portion of the scapula are coated with an osseous layer. Sergeant F. H. H., "A," 121st Pennsylvania: Gettysburg, 1st July; admitted hospital, Philadelphia, 13th July; died, exhausted, with pyaemic symptoms, 2d August, 1863. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Wm. V. Keating. 2180. The right scapula, with the posterior portion of the spine carried away by a bullet which appears to have passed b. 12. from below upward. Two slight fissures exist in the lower plate. The whole posterior surface of the bone shows marks of periosteal disturbance. Private N. O., "D," 1st Florida Cavalry (Rebel): Mission Ridge, 25th November; admitted hospital, Nashville, 7th December, 1863; died, from double pneumonia, 27th January, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Preston Peter. 832. The right scapula badly fractured by a bullet which entered the superior wing at the middle of its upper border, b. 13. shattered the spine at its junction with the dorsum, and, passing on, fractured the fourth rib and lodged against the vertebrae. Private C. K, " H," 28th Pennsylvania: Antietam, 17th September; died, Frederick, 1st December. 1862. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. Bernard Brinton, U. S. Army. 3089. The left scapula. A bullet struck the posterior border two inches above the inferior angle and passed inward, b. 14. lodging in the spinal canal. The specimen is comminuted and transversely grooved at the point of impact, and a fracture extends across the bone, the lower fragment of which is bent inward. Periosteal inflammation has been induced on both sides of the larger fragment. Corporal G. W. M., "B," 53d Pennsylvania, 19: Cold Harbor, 3d June; admitted hospital, Washington, 7th; died, paraplegic, with pneumonia, 19th June, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon R. B. Bontecou, U. S. Vols. See 3030, III. A. B. b. 17. 1211. The left scapula fractured in the head and dorsum by a conoidal ball which, split in two pieces, lies below the b. 15. spine. The ball has passed through the bone carrying away a square inch of its surface. The line of fracture crosses the glenoid cavity and runs backward and downward to the posterior border of the bone. The tip of the coracoid process is carious. Private J. B., "H," 7th Massachusetts, 34: Chancellorsviile, 3d May; admitted hospital, Washington, 9th; died, from secondary haemorrhage and exhaustion, 25th May, 1863. Contributed by Surgeon O. A. Judson, U. S. Vols. See class XXVII. B. B. d. 3585. The left scapula fractured by a bullet which first impinged against its anterior border just below the glenoid b. 16. cavity and then struck the spine at the junction of the acromion and was extracted from the supra-spinous fossa. A deep longitudinal fracture nearly separates the spine from the dorsum of the bone. The coracoid process is nearly split off, and the whole inferior plate is occupied with fissures, none of which directly communicate with the original fracture but which together nearly destroy the bone. Another bullet entered below the axilla and escaped at the distal extremity of the scapula, and still another entered the left thorax between the ninth and tenth ribs. Private W. A. S, "B," 13th Indiana, 27: Petersburg, 30th July; admitted hospital, Washington, 3d August; died, from pleuro-pneumonia, 7th August, 1864. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson, U. S. Army.

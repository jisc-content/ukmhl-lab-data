CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION 520 XXIII 3637. A wet preparation of the lower portion of the right leg and tarsus, showing hospital gangrene following contusion B. 22. of the bones involving the joint.

A wet preparation of the left foot, showing the destruction of a metatarsal stump by hospital gangrene. The B. 24. disorganization of the tissues is very complete. Private J. C, "D," 88th Pennsylvania: toes amputated in the field, Cold Harbor, 3d June; admitted hospital, Washington, 11th; gangrene appeared, 20th; amputated in the middle third of the leg by Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M. Dean, 22d June; discharged, 3d August, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon E. L. Bliss. 3661. A wet preparation of the right foot, after amputation just above the malleoli. The tarso-metatarsal articulation of B. 25. the great toe was fractured by shell. Phagedenic ulceration followed, involving the whole dorsum of the foot, from which, in the specimen, a huge slough is about separating. This may be regarded a fair type of hospital gangrene. Private J. W., "E," 5th New Jersey, 27 : Petersburg, 18th June; admitted hospital, Philadelphia, 30th June ; amputated for gangrene and secondary haemorrhage by Acting Assistant Surgeon F. H.

A wet preparation of the left foot, exhibiting profound destruction of the anterior and inner portion by hospital B. 26. gangrene following primary amputation through the metatarsal bone of the great toe. In the specimen the calcaneuin is sawn through and the leg bones do not appear, as if Pirogoff's operation had been performed. The history, however, states that amputation was performed in the lowest third of the leg. Private G. W. P., "C," 2d Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery: admitted hospital, Washington, 1st August; amputated by Surgeon N. K. Mosely, U. S. Vols., 14th; died, 25th August, 1864.

A wet preparation of the greater portion of the left foot, showing the ravages of hospital gangrene following fracture B. 27. of the second toe. All the toes, except the great one, are missing and the metatarsals protrude. The slough, with no line of demarcation, extends nearly to the ankle. Private P. F., "B," 170th New York, 42: Petersburg, 17th June; admitted hospital, Philadelphia, 2d July; sloughing commenced, 4th July ; amputated at the junction of the lower thirds by Acting Assistant Surgeon G.

A wet preparation of the left hand, from which the last two fingers and the fifth metacarpal bone have been B. 28. removed. Amputation was performed in the middle third for a gangrenous condition that followed the wound. Caries invaded the carpus and an opening for pus is seen in the integument near the joint. Extensive sinuses extended up the forearm. Private J.

511 A. 13. OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM. c. Other Tissues. 1879. A cyst, containing a conoidal pistol ball extracted (after amputation for another injury) from the popliteal space, C. 1. where it had remained, beneath the outer hamstring- tendons, without inconvenience, two years and one mouth. First Sergeant H. M. L., " D," 12th Illinois Cavalry: wounded in Kentucky, October, 18(51; leg amputated for fracture by a fall from his horse, Washington, 10th November, 1863. Contributed by Surgeon N. E. Mosely, U. S. Vols. See 1744, XV. B. B. d. 1. See classes XXVII. B. B.C.; XXVII. B'. 1930. A wet preparation of the fascia lata, from the anterior aspect of the lowest fourth of the right thigh, stretched c. 2. upon a glass frame two and half by five and a half inches. In the specimen, which does not appear to be the whole of the original contribution, the net-work or checkered relation of the fibres is well shown. " At the time of removal the specimen was round, firm, eighteen inches in length and about one-fourth of an inch in diameter. After six days' maceration in alcohol and water it separated in layers and assumed its present membranous appearance." The probe followed the track of the ball twenty inches. The bone was uninjured. Private T. P., "G," 10th Kentucky, 20: Chickamauga, 20th September; specimen removed by Assistant Surgeon Chas. J. Kipp, U. S. Vols., Nashville, 4th October, 1863; deserted on furlough, 24th January, 1864. Contributed by the operator. 221ยง. The little finger of the left hand, amputated through the metacarpal bone. The tissues are somewhat shattered c. 3. and the joint invaded by pus. After amputation threatened gangrene was averted by internal and external stimulation. Private L. L., "6," 5th Virginia, 24: Second Bull Run, 30th August; admitted hospital, Washington, 1st September; amputated by Acting Assistant Surgeon A. P. Williams, 8th September, 1862. Recovered. Contributed by the operator. See class XXIII. A. B. 2267. The ring finger, disarticulated at the metacarpal joint for fracture with laceration in the middle of the member, c. 4. Contributed by Surgeon A. F. Sheldon, U. S. Vols. See class X. A. B. d. 2610. The ring finger of the right hand, disarticulated at the metacarpus for fracture in the first phalanx. A fragment c. 5. of lead yet remains lodged in the soft tissues. Private W. L., "I," 1st Pennsylvania Reserves: Fredericksburg, 13th December, 1862; amputated by Acting Assistant Surgeon E. A. Kcerper, Philadelphia, January, 1863. Recovered. Contributed by the operator. See class X. A. B. d. 1793. The right thumb, disarticulated for fracture by a conoidal ball. The soft tissues are swollen and discolored, c. 6. Private J. J., "F," 7th Virginia, (Rebel,) 24: Gettysburg, 2d July; amputated by Surgeon L. Quick, U. S. Vols., Baltimore, 9th July, 1863. Contributed by the operator. See class X. A. B. d. 503. A wet preparation of the ring finger of the left hand, disarticulated between the first and second phalanges for c. 7. injury on the outer side, where the bone is roughened by the bullet. Private J. B., "C," 43d New York: admitted hospital, Washington, 11th July, 1862. Contributed by Dr. R. C. Croggon. See class X. A. B. d. 1037. The right hand and forearm. The metacarpal bones of the thumb, index and middle fingers were fractured by a c. 8. musket ball. Pus burrowing among the muscles had disorganized the carpal articulations and denuded the bones of the forearm. The appearance of the specimen, simulating the ravages of hospital gangrene, is due to the careless cutting away of the integument after amputation. Private J. D. L., "F," 114th Ohio: Vicksburg, 29th December, 1862; admitted hospital, Paducah, Ky., 13th January; amputated in the upper third of the forearm, 15th; died of pyasmia, 18th January, 1863. Contributed by Surgeon H. P. Stearns, U. S. Vols. See class IX. A. B. c. 1796. The left hand, after amputation in the lowest third of the forearm. The ball entered the dorsum of the hand near c. 9. the base of the index metacarpal and escaped near the base of the thumb, grazing the os magnum. The specimen shows several openings on the palmar surface of the wrist and forearm, due to the burrowing and escape of pus by its own action.

The bones of the left knee, in which the outer angle of the patella is grazed, the outer e. 72. condyle shattered and the head of the tibia fractured by a eonoidal ball.

The wound was inflicted at very close range, in a charge upon our pickets, and its peculiar character seems due to the great momentum of the missile. Private C.

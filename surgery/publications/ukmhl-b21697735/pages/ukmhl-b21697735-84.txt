78 IV. CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION 2391. The scapula and parts of the first six ribs of the right side. A bullet has perforated the scapula just below the b. 41. spine and near its posterior border, carrying away about one square inch of its surface and depressing twice as great an area, and destroying the spinal extremities of the fifth and sixth ribs. It then badly fractured the third, fourth and fifth dorsal vertebras and the fourth rib of the right side. The coracoid and acromial extremities and the glenoid cavity have been the seat of necrosed action, which appears to have been arrested before death. Private N. P., " G," 124th New York, 18: died, 17th May, 1864. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon A. Ansell. See 2330, III. A. a. b. 8. 2121. The lower third of the right scapula and the adjoining portions of the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth ribs, b. 42. The ball struck four inches below the axilla, and passing backward escaped at the inferior angle of the scapula. The specimen shows the extremity of the scapula carried away, the tenth rib comminuted, and the ninth contused. The fractured extremities are necrosed. The thoracic surfaces show free deposits of osseous matter which agglutinate them. The specimen is also interesting as a memorial of the ligation of the intercostal artery. Private F. W., "A," 33d Ohio: Chickamauga, 20th September; remained on the field ten days ; then admitted hospital, Murfreesboro'; intercostal ligated for secondary haemorrhage, by Surgeon I. Moses, U. S. Vols., 5th October: "died of emphysema of the same side," late in October, 18 â– '.'>. Contributed by the operator. See class XVIII. II. A. B. b. 1215. The right scapula, upper third of the humerus, and sections of the fifth, seventh and eighth ribs. Two inches b. 43. of the inferior angle of the scapula are separated. The inner part of the humerus is carried away, and fissures run two inches down the shaft, making the fracture complete. The ioint surfaces are normal. Oblique fractures of the three ribs exist near their centres. There is no attempt at repair. Private T. L., "K," ]st Massachusetts, 42: Second Fredericksburg, 3d May; admitted hospital, Washington, 9th; died, 11th May, J 863. Contributed by Surgeon O. A. Judson, U. S. Vols. See class VI. A. B. b. 720. The right scapula and sternal half of the clavicle. A bullet has carried away the distal extremity of the clavicle, b. 44. and passing backward and downward fractured the scapula at the junction of the spine and dorsum, shattering both. The points of immediate perforation are necrosed, and the adjacent bone has slight deposit of new matter. The head of the humerus, which is attached, is eroded, which was not suspected in life. Private W. A. F., 'G," 16th Maine: Fredericksburg, ]3th December; admitted hospital, Washington, 18th December, 1862; died, 13th January, 1863. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon Alex. Ingram, U. S. Army. 1304. The clavicle, scapula and first and second ribs of the right side. A bullet entered near its sternal extremity, b. 45. comminuted the clavicle, fractured the first and second ribs, aud escaped through the scapula just below the spine, which is greatly shattered. The subclavian artery was not opened, although the inner coats were much lacerated and the vein was torn. Sergeant J. M. W., " I," 53d Massachusetts, 45: Port Hudson, La., 27th May; admitted hospital, New Orleans, 29th May; died, 7th June, 1863. Contributed by 4ssistant Surgeon P. S. Conner, U. S. Army. See 1305, XXII. A. B. a. 2. 245. The clavicle, third, fourth, fifth and sixth ribs, and scapula of the left side, all fractured by a conoidal ball, b. 46. The clavicle is fractured nearly transversely, with little comminution, at the junction of the outer thirds. Callus has been moderately deposited without union. The third, fourth and fifth ribs have been fractured near their angles, aud are bound together by new bone, which has irregularly repaired the injury and attached them to the sixth. The scapula is perforated near the posterior border and below the spine, with the loss of about one square inch of substance A fissure two inches in length extends interiorly from the point of perforation, another of three inches occupies the spine in its length, and two smaller ones cross the upper plate of the bone. A small amount of callus is deposited about the perforation. Private E. L., 87th New York: Second Bull Run, 29th August; admitted hospital, Washington, 1st September; died from pneumonia, after exposure against orders, 3d November, 1862. Contributed by Surgeon A.

Contributed by Surgeon B. A. Vanderkieft, U. S. Vols. 1781. The right femur, five months after gunshot fracture in the middle third. The limb had been treated by horizontal b. 71. extension and is a little shortened, but the fractured ends are not in apposition, and the two portions are joined by a slender bridge formed chiefly from the fragments of old bone and in part by callus. The shaft at the point of solution is carious. A sequestrum an inch in length was removed a week before death. Private A.

The greater portion of the right femur, obliquely fractured at the junction of the lower thirds and partly consoli- b. 72. dated with much shortening. The new bone formation firmly retains the fragments, and is sufficiently rounded to indicate the lapse of considerable time. The adjacent surfaces of the old bone are, at places, carious. Contributed by Surgeon D. W. Bliss, U. S. Vols. 1298. The greater portion of the right femur, shattered in the middle third by a musket ball. There is a slight deposit b. 73. of callus beyond the lines of necrosis ; that on the upper fragment is irregular in position, as though due to scraped-up periosteum. Corporal J. R., "A," 1st Louisiaua Cavalry, 32: New Iberia, 16th April; died from exhaustion, New Orleans, 5th June, 1863. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon P. S. Conner, U. S. Army. 3892.

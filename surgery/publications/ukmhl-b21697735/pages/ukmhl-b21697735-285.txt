The upper portion of the left femur, obliquely fractured through the trochanters, with a fair deposit of callus, but b. 170. without union. The hip joint appears to have been involved Contributed without history by Surgeon A. B. Hasson, U. S. Army. 1944. The upper third of the right femur, fractured obliquely below the trochanters by a conoidal ball. Shortening of b. 171. nearly four inches has occurred, with very slight union. The extremities are carious. Private H. F., "G," 55th Ohio, 20: Gettysburg, 2d July; died from exhaustion, 26th September, 1803. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon E. P. Townsend. 1935. The upper portion of the right femur, fractured just below the trochanters, with profuse deposit of callus with- b. 172. out union. The history reports "a complete false joint, the head and socket being covered with a dense, smooth and apparently fibrous membrane," but this is not seen in the specimen. Private S. M., "A," 63d New York, 26: Gettysburg, 2d July; died from exhaustion, 8th October, 1863. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon E. P. Townsend. 233. The upper half of the right femur, obliquely fractured and comminuted below the trochanters. A considerable b. 173. deposit of callus, imprisoning the larger fragments and affording partial union, has occurred Contributed by Surgeon A. Bournonville, U. S. Vols. 27. The upper half of the left femur, shattered just below the trochanters. Partial union at right angles has occurred b. 174. Callus entangling the fragments has been somewhat copiously thrown out, but the inner surfaces are carious. The shaft, nearly the length of the specimen, is roughened by the action of pus. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon Warren Webster, U. S. Army. 3881. The right fi-mur, united, with two inches shortening, after fracture by a conoidal ball in the upper third. A largo b. 175. fragment is bound fast, a small sequestrum is nearly loose, the ends are well rounded, and the lower extremity is diseased as far as the condyles. Private M.

The operation appears to have heen hy antero- b. 159. posterior flaps. There is a granulating surface, two inches broad by five long, over the face of the stump, as though following sloughing of the integument. Contributor and history unknown. 2ยง28. A cast of the stump of the left femur, after amputation in the middle third. The cast is not a very well-defined b. 160. one, but it shows necrosis of the bone nearly to the trochanters. Major G. S.

Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. W. S. Gouley, U. S. Army. 2458. A cast of the stump of the right knee, six months after disarticulation. Antero-posterior flaps were made.

A cast of the stump of the left leg, seven months after circular amputation just below the knee. The integument b. 163. appears to have sloughed on the face of the stump, and the cast simulates the protrusion of the tibia. There is no warrant in the history, however, that the bone was exposed. Corporal T. W. D., " K," 30th Maine, 22: Pleasant Hill, La., 9th April; admitted hospital, with small indolent ulcer of stump, New York, 20th September; cast made in New York; discharged the service, 22d November, 1864. Artificial limb furnished. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Geo. F. Shrady. 473. A cast of a stump which appears to have been made by a circular amputation just below the knee. The flaps b. 164. are full and the puckered cicatrix is small. Private J. J. M., "D," 76th Pennsylvania: Fort Wagner, S. C, 11th July; amputated middle (?) third, l.Sth July, 1863; discharged the service, 17th January, 1864. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. VV. S. Gouley, U. S. Army. 4375. A cast of the stump of the left leg, six months after primary circular amputation in the upper third. The stump b. 165. is so well formed that it represents one made by carefully adapted flaps.

Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Geo. F. Shrady. 1528. A plaster cast of the right leg, about seventeen months after amputation in the upper third. The bones are well b. 166. covered, but the posterior flap appears redundant in its lower portion while the cicatrix is irregular and depressed. Private A. O., "D," 83d New York, 28: wounded and amputated, Wilderness, 5th May, 1864 ; cast made, Albany, fall of 1865; transferred to New York, 28th October, 1865. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. H. Armsby, U. S. Vols. 1856. A cast of the stump of the left thigh, primarily amputated, by the circular method, in the upper third, nine months b. 167. after the operation. Much of the wound healed by the first intention. Necrosis of the femur prevented complete union, and the stump shows what may be taken as a point of protrusion in the midst of its otherwise well- rounded shape. Private S. D.

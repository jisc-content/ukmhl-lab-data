C, " I," 63d Pennsylvania, 18 : shell wound crest of right ilium, White Oak Swamp, Va., 30th June ; admitted hospital, Baltimore, 27th July; necrosed surface gouged and fragments escaped from time to time; wound entirely closed and discharged the service, 27th November, 1862. " There was some contraction of the muscles of the thigh, and the foot could not long be maintained on the ground without inconvenience." Contributed by Surgeon Lavington Quick, U. S. Vols. 3619. A large number of small bony fragments, some of which are necrosed and some represent new deposits, removed e. 2. from the left ilium perforated by a conoidal ball. Sergeant H. O., "M," 24th New York Cavalry, 2:5: Cold Harbor, 3d June; bullet-removed over the trochanter major, 9th July; furloughed, 17th September, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon Joseph Hopkinsou, U. S. Vols. 2214. Eight necrosed and carious fragments of bone, representing nearly one square inch of the ilium, and two metallic e. 3. rings from a bullet. The battered bullet is mounted with the specimen. A conoidal ball entered the left iliac region, wounded the descending colon, perforated the ilium in its posterior quarter and lodged subcutaneously at the back of the pelvis, whence it was cut out. The intestine adhered to the muscular parietes of the pelvis and communicated with an abscess under the iliaeus internus and psoas magnus, which communicated with both apertures and was probably caused, first by the ball and then by the burrowing of the pus. The cavity of the descending colon was very small; long faeces of small calibre were accustomed to pass out of the wound of entrance. Private J. R. M., "E," 11th Mississippi (Rebel): probably Gettysburg, 3d July, 1863; died, Baltimore, 12th March, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon Thos. H. Bache, U. S. Vols. See 2217, XI. A. B. b. 34; 2216, XX.

CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION XIV. 332 3175. The lowest third of the right femur. A conoidal ball lodged in the shaft on its outer b. 83. surface, just at its junction with the condyles, producing an oblique fracture, with radiations, and splitting off the posterior portion of the inner condyle. See figure 112. Contributor and history unknown. See class XXVII. B. B. d. 4707. The right patella, perforated just above its centre with radiating fractures. The broken b. 84. borders are slightly necrosed, and a minute particle of lead yet remains in the bone. Private A.

The upper portions of the bones of the right leg, after death from exhaustion from a wound b. 85. involving the joint. A conoidal ball entered from the front, four inches below the articula- tion, produced a partial fracture of the tibia on the outer side, passed into the joint and rested on the spinous process. The articulation is eroded at points, and at the place of contact with the ball is necrosed. The missile was not discovered in life. Corporal T. J., "G," 149th Pennsylvania, 19: Gettysburg, 1st July; admitted hospital, Philadelphia, 13th; died exhausted, 23d July, 1863. He was too weak to bear an operation at any time.

The lowest third of the right femur. The outer condyle is fractured by the direct passage from front to rear of a b. 87. bullet on its inferior surface. A longitudinal fracture extends three and a half inches up the posterior surface of the shaft, prolonged two inches further as a fissure. A complete oblique fracture extends through the shaft, connected with the injury to the condyle only by the longitudinal fracture. Contributed, without history, by Surgeon Thomas Autisell, U. S.

A drawing of this specimen, when recent, is on file. 2009. The lower halves of the bones of the right leg. The tibia is hypertrophied and in its lowest third presents several C. 8. abscesses, as though of a syphilitic character. The fibula is partly absorbed and has a moderate periosteal deposit near the seat of disease. Private W.

The lower portions of the bones of the right leg, with the. tibia shattered into the joint, and probably primarily C. 11. amputated. The specimen is chiefly remarkable for an articulation formed by the adjoining surfaces of the exostoses about one inch above the ankle. Contributor and history unknown. See class XVI. A. A. e. 3096. A section of the tibia, from the junction of the upper thirds, six months after the removal of carious bone, for C. 12. scrofulous disease, by the gouge and saw. The opening was two and a half inches in length and extended to the medullary cavity. The volume of the bone is doubled and the artificial opening is nearly closed by new formation. An oblique section shows the walls very much hypertrophied and, opposite the seat of disease, loose in texture. Nearer the sound bone the tissue is very compact. The interior was highly colored when recent, and presents numerous small abscess- like cavities. R. R., colored girl, 12: died of tuberculosis, six months after the operation.

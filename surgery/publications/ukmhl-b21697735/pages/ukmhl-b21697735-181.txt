The lower half of the left humerus and upper half of the ulna, completely anchylosed. There has been an impacted b. 1. fracture of the elbow, the inner condyle being displaced forward and inward and resting on the coronoid process, which is also partially fractured and displaced. The olecranon rests in the olecranon fossa and both bones are firmly united in osseous anchylosis with lateral deformity. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon J. W. S. Gouley, U. S. Army.

The lower half of the right humerus and the bones of the forearm, amputated two months after injury on a railroad, g. 1. The bones of the forearm are fractured near the middle and again at their upper extremities. The greater portions of the shafts are necrosed, having slight and imperfect involucra. The fragments of the lower extremity of the humerus are attached to it in irregular positions by callus. The bones appear to be from a subject about sixteen years old. : Railroad accident, Mound City, 111., 18th April; amputated in middle third of humerus by Surgeon H. Wardner, TJ. S.

The trochlear surface is C. 1. malformed, as if by displacement forward, so as to destroy the coronoid fossa; the head of the radius is much enlarged and flattened, with an articular surface double the ordinary size; the coronoid process is apparently displaced forward, and the olecranon is wanting, from a subsequent fracture. The only history is: Corporal W.

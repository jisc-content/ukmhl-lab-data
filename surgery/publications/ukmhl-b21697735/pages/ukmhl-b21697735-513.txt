A portion of integument from the dorsum of the left foot, showing he wound of entrance made by a grape shot, a. 1. one and a half inches in diameter, which passed perpendicularly through the tarsus. The wound, the lips of which are slightly everted, seems hardly practicable for so large a missile. Contributed by Surgeon Meredith Clymer, U. S. Vols. See 1157, XVI. A. B. b. 13; 1159, XXII. A. A. a. 2. 1159. A portion of the integument from the plantar surface of the left foot, showing the wound of exit made by a a. 2. grape shot of one and a half inches in diameter which entered the dorsum of the tarsus. The orifice is rather larger than that of entrance, but does not appear practicable for a missile of that size. Contributed by Surgeon Meredith Clymer, U. S. Vols. See 1157, XVI. A. B. b. 13; 1158, XXII. A. A. a. 1. lOYO. A portion of the integument from the outer side of the leg, exhibiting an irregularly ragged shell wound of entrance a. 3. two by four inches, with much loss of substance. Two inches of the shaft of the fibula was carried away. The inner tuberosity was also wouuded by a bullet. Although taken from a case secondary as to cause of death, the specimen does not show any change from a recent condition. Private W. H., "D," 28th Pennsylvania: probably Chancellorsville, 3d May; admitted hospital, Washington, 7th May, 1863 ; died from tetanus the same day. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon C. C. Byrne, U. S. Army.

Integument from the inner side of the knee, with a bullet wound of entrance over the inner tuberosity. The a. 4. orifice is irregularly triangular with a moderate loss of tissue. A severe shell wound was also suffered or the outer side of the leg. Death resulted from a secondary cause, but this wound is essentially primary in its condition. Private W. H., "D,'* 28th Pennsylvania: probably Chancellorsville, 3d May; admitted hospital, Washington, 7th May, 1863 ; died of tetanus the same day. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon C. C. Byrne, U. S. Army.

The left hand, amputated in the lowest third of the forearm for fracture and laceration by a conoidal ball at the c. 1. closest range. The charge entered the palmar surface of the middle of the carpus, which it shattered, and r.absed out through the bases of the first three metacarpal bones. The wound of entrance is discolored by powder. Private C. H. B., "K," 3d Battalion, 5th New York Heavy Artillery: accidentally, 28th July, 1863; amputated at once by Assistant Surgeon J. T.

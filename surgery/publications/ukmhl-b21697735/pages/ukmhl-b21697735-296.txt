CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION XIII. 290 See class XXVII. B. B. d. 118. The two lower thirds of the right femur, comminuted by a. perforating colloidal ball. The line of necrosis is d. 66. fairly marked on the borders of the fracture, and the fragments of dead bone are held by deposits of callus. Private G. W. L., "B," 2d New York, 22: Second Bull Run, 29th August; remained on the field until 6th September; amputated by Acting Assistant Surgeon H. C. Heilner, Georgetown, 19th September, 1862.

The bone was fractured in the middle third by d. 67. a conoidal bullet. Union of considerable strength has occurred, although, owing to the removal of fragments, the extremities of the bone are not in apposition. Necrosed fragments are entangled in the new bone, and the shaft is diseased to the knee. Examination of the medulla after amputation showed it of a coppery red color. Private J. P., "H," 119th Pennsylvania, 23: Rappahannock Station, Va., 7th November; admitted hospital, Washington, 9th November, 1863; fragments removed at intervals and doing well until twice attacked with diffusive inflammation, when amputation in upper third was performed, 18th April; died from exhaustion, 26th April, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon J. A. Lidell, U. S. Vols. See class XIII. A. I!, e. 755. The two lower thirds of the right femur, fractured at their junction, with oblique splitting of the posterior surface d. 68. of the lowest third. A moderate amount of callus has been thrown out, and the extremities of the fragments are in contact without union. The internal portions of both are greatly necrosed. Private D. J. O'B., "H," 69th New York: Antietam, 17th September; amputated by Surgeon H. S. Hewit, U. S. Vols., Frederick, 5th December ; died, 16th December, 1862. Contributed by the operator. See 1101, XIII. A.

Amputation was probably performed within the first ten days. Received after Chancellorsville. See classes XIII. A. B. a.; XXVII. B. B. d. 1638. The lowest third of the left femur, perforated by a bullet which entered on the outer surface of the shaft just d. 70. above the outer condyle and passed inward and backward. An oblique fracture with comminution extends upward three inches, but the epiphysis has escaped injury. Contributor and history unknown. 1658. The lower portion of the right femur, amputated in the middle third. The shaft was perforated just above the d. 71. condyles by a ball which entered the anterior surface and passed upward and backward, transversely fracturing the bone with some upward comminution. There are the remains of periosteal inflammation. Contributor and history unknown. 1076. The amputated portion of the left femur, fractured in the lowest third by two round leaden balls from spherical d. 72. case; one missile is embedded in the medullary canal and the other, flattened, lodged in the vastus externus muscle.

CATALOGUE OF THE SURGICAL SECTION 278 XIII. 724. The upper half of the right femur, from an old subject, comminuted below the trochanters. The extremities are b. 156. necrosed, and a slight fringe of callus has formed. Contributed by Surgeon B. A. Vanderkieft, U. S. Vols. 1938. The upper portion of the left femur, fractured below the trochanters by a b. 157. conoidal ball. The specimen shows the deposit of large quantities of folia- ceous callus surrounding the extremities and involving the fragments. 6'ce figure 94. Private E. W. A., " G," 5th Florida, (Rebel,) 18: Gettysburg, 3d July; died, ex- hausted, 15th September, 1803. Contributed by Surgeon H. Janes, U. S. Vols. See 4627, XXVI. A. 1,5. 618. The left femur, fractured in the upper third by a spherical ball. A fragment b. 158. nearly six inches long and one-third of the diameter of the femur was split off. A moderate amount of callus was effused at the extremities. Private J. B., " K," 44th New York, 26: Gaines' Mill, 27th June; a prisoner several weeks; reached Philadelphia, 26th July; secondary haemorrhage, 5th November; died, 6th November, 1862. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon J. B. Bowen. 2285. The greater portion of the left femur, with a long oblique fracl(*ft-€^teii(liiig b. 159. through the upper third of the shaft. There is little comminution, but the slight formations of callus are insufficient to afford union. A flattened frag- ment of a conoidal ball is attached. Private G. B., "C," 15th New York Heavy Artillery. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon G. K. Smith. See class XXVII. B. B. d. 333. The upper half of the right femur, very badly comminuted below and ou the posterior surface of the trochanters, b. 160. The cancellated tissue is exposed nearly to the capsular ligament. The lines of fracture are bordered by foliaceous callus, which, however, has availed nothing for union. The broken bone is carious and necrosed. Private J. S., "A," 56th Pennsylvania; admitted hospital, Washington, 1st September; died, 7th November, 1862. Contributed by Surgeon D. W. Bliss, U. S. Vols. I .»3 I. The upper portion of the right femur, obliquely fractured in the upper third and bruised at the base of the great b. 161. trochanter. There is a fringe of spongy callus without union. The specimen bears the mark of much suppuration and it appears as though some of the new bone had been lost. Private O. F. W., "G," 154th New York, 25: Chancellorsville, 3d May; treated in Acquia Creek Hospital until sent to Washington, 14th June; died from exhaustion, 31st July, 1863. Contributed by Surgeon D. W. Bliss, U. S. Vols. 2200. A portion of the left femur, obliquely fractured with some comminution in the upper third. There is no union b. 162. between the extremities, which are chiefly carious, but a large fragment has become united, with displacement, to the lower portion. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon G. P. Hachenburg. 4241. The shaft of the left femur, fractured at the junction of the upper and middle thirds by a round ball. There is a b. 163. considerable deposit of callus, and at death, which happened on the eighty-third day, from diarrhoea complicated with pneumonia, partial union had occurred with half an inch shortening. This union was broken in the post mortem examination. The muscles at the seat of fracture were contracted and had lost their elasticity from the# callus deposited in them. A small sinus ran down nearly to the inner condyle, and the periosteum in its track was diseased from contact with pus. Private A. H., " K," 5th Wisconsin, 21: Burksville, Va., 6th April; admitted hospital, Washington, 19th April; died, 28th June, 1865. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon G. K. Smith. 3787. The upper half of the left femur, fractured just below the trochanters. There is moderate necrosis and slight b. 164. deposit of callus. "Patient insisted there was no fracture." Lieutenant L. J., "E," 3d Massachusetts Cavalry: Cedar Creek, 19th October; died from exhaustion, Win- chester, 7th December, 1864. Contributed by Surgeon L. P. Wa gner, 114th New York.

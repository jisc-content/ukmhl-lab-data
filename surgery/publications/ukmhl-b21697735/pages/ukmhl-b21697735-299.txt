The lower half of the right femur, exhibiting an osteo-plastic operation. A musket ball entered the outer surface e. 29. of the outer condyle and escaped from the posterior surface in the middle of the lowest third. The bone was much broken on the posterior surface. The femur was amputated a short distance above the wound of entrance, the patella being included in the anterior flap; the line of section not having escaped the wound, another third of an inch was removed ; the femoral surface of the patella was then sawn off and the two cut surfaces of the bone were brought in apposition. The laminated portion of the femur, however, was fractured half an inch above this point, and fissures extended two inches further. On the sixth day sloughing commenced, on the eighth signs of gangrene were noticed, and on the ninth the femur was amputated in the middle third (on account of the burrowing of pus) for secondary hfemorrhage from the popliteal. No plastic deposit could be observed immediately after the operation. Private B., 20: Fredericksburg, 13th December; osteo-plastic operation by Assistant Surgeon J. W. S. Gouley, U. S.

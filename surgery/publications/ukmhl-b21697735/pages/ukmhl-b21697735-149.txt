Amputations in the humerus. f. Other operations. a. Contusions and Partial Fractures. 1538. The lower half of the left humerus, fractured above the condyles by a conoidal ball passing transversely. A a. 1. partial fracture extends into the joint. The upper portions of the radius and ulna are attached. Contributed by Surgeon J. H. Brinton, U. S. Vols. 526. The lower half of the left humerus, transversely perforated one inch above the condyles. The shaft is shattered, a. 2. and fissures extend to the margin of the olecranon fossa. The upper portions of the bones of the forearm are attached to the specimen. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon W. Moss, U. S. Vols. b. Complete Fractures. 478. The bones of the forearm, from which the lower portions have been removed after comminution. The point b. 1. of interest in the specimen is a fracture of the coronoid process unconnected with the severe injury in the lower part of the limb. Contributed by Surgeon Leonard, 59th New York. See class VHI. A. A. b. 1884. The bones of the right forearm. The upper fourths of the shafts are entirely wanting ; the head of the radius is b. 2. fractured antero-posteriorly ; the termination of the fracture in the shaft of the ulna is jagged and nearly transverse. Contributed by Surgeon J. Dwinelle, 106th Pennsylvania. 4'74. The bones of the left forearm. Excepting two inches of the upper and one and a half inches of the lower b. 3. extremities, the ulna has been carried away. The coronoid process is split off, but not displaced. The lowest third of the radius is comminuted, and an independent, nearly transverse fracture exists in the upper third. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon W. Moss, U S. Vols. See class VIII. A. A. b. 3135. The lower extremity of the right humerus. A bullet has impinged on the anterior face at the junction of the b. 4. inner condyle and trochlea, crushing the laminated structure. An oblique fracture extends upward and outward one and a half inches, and downward through the ulnar face of the trochlea. Received from the Army of the Potomac. SOW. The bones of the left elbow. The humerus is transversely fractured one and a half inches above the condyle by b. 5. a missile striking and comminuting the outer border; an oblique fracture extends two and a half inches above this point, and is intersected by a perpendicular fracture running up the inner side; two oblique fractures below the transverse line converge and as one divide the trochlea at its middle.

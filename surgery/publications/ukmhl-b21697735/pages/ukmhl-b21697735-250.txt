Nearly the whole of the articular surface is carious, without any perceptible c. 2. injury having been directly inflicted upon the bone. The condition is the probable result of inflammation following a flesh wound. Contributor and history unknown. 2198. The bones of the left hip joint. The head of the femur is carious and the articular surface has been roughened c. 3. by ulceration. A conoidal ball entered the thigh near the tuber ischii, but could be discovered neither during life nor after death. Private C. S., "E," 22d Michigan, 21: Chickamauga, 20th Septenber; admitted hospital, Nashville,I7th November, L863; died from pyaemia, 18th February, 18(i4. Contributed by Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M.

Contributed by Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson, U. S. Army. 3572. The left innominatum and upper extremity of the femur. The ilium is very badly fractured just above the c. 5. acetabulum. A plate rather more than two inches square, covered with callus, has nearly exfoliated from the centre of the ilium. Below that on the anterior border is a necrosed lamina, one inch square, yet attached ; externally a moderate new osseous layer exists; and the line of the fracture is necrosed. The hip joint has been opened, apparently by secondary involvement, and the articular surfaces of both bones are eroded, with a partial loss by absorption of the iliac portion of the acetabulum. Private J. G. A., "D," 26th Michigan: admitted hospital, Washington, 28th May; died exhausted after secondary haemorrhage, 30th June, 1864. Contributed by Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson, U. S. Army.

The upper third of the right femur, fractured in the trochanter major by a small conoidal ball which passed through C. 6. the ilium, penetrated the abdominal cavity and was extracted near the centre of the rectus abdominis. A very extensive, amount of callus is depoi-ited around the trochanters, and the head of the bone is nearly destroyed by suppuration. Private W. Y., "D," 19th Massachusetts, 39: Antietam, 17th September; admitted hospital, Frederick, 28th December, 1862; slight attack of erysipelas, last of March; hip joint became involved and death occurred, 4th July, 1863.

A. 1,38. 3394. The upper portion of the left femur, badly comminuted below the trochanters and b. 189. united, shortened and mal-adapted, with a profuse deposit of callus. A number of large fragments, which have preserved their life, serve, covered with callus, to connect the broken shaft. But the central cavity is carious, and from its suppuration appears to have proceeded fatal exhaustion. Fig. 1)6. Consolidated gr Contributed by Assistant Surgeon C. C. Byrne, U. S. Army. See class XXVII. B. B. d. Spec, nm 3416. The shaft of the left femur comminuted, with longitudinal Assuring of the middle third.

There is short- b. 191. ening for two inches with lateral displacement. Foliaceous callus has been largely deposited, but the union is not of any strength. The extremities of the shaft are carious, and a few deep-seated necrosed fragments may be seen. History and contributor unknown. 1045. The lower portion of the left femur, showing a consolidated gunshot fracture at the junction of the lower thirds, b. 192. There is three inches shortening with autero-posterior deformity. Union has occurred, but the fractured portion is filled with sinuses which lead to a carious condition of the shaft. The specimen is sawn longitudinally to expose the internal structure. Received without history from Brevet Major George M. McGill, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. Army. 1130. The inferior half of the right femur, perforated, with comminution, in the lowest third.

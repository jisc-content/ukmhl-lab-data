39 I to be followed in this case, is to reduce this horrid-looking wound to the simple state of a limb which has been separated by art. We carefully examine the extent of the in- jury done, particularly to the bone, and ampu- tate on the sound part, as much beyond the injury as we conveniently can. If, however, the bone is splintered to the very joint, or so*close as to excite? our fears as to future consequences, we operate beyond it, on the upper part of the limb. If the head of the humerus itself is injured, or the shaft splintered, with much destruction of the soft parts ; or if the head of the bone alone is left in the glenoid cavity, the rest being car- ried off, we forthwith take it out of the socket; an operation as simple, if properly planned, as any in surgery ; and one which, on all occasions where the bone is injured high up, is infinitely preferable to amputation lower down. It not unfcequently occurs that the arm is carried clean out of the socket; and in this case very little more remains for the surgeon to do, than to pass a ligature round the arteries, even though they do not bleed, as often happens—to cut short the lash of nerves, which, in this case, usually hangs far out of the wound—to bring the lips towards each other by adhesive straps, and to support them by proper compress and bandage.

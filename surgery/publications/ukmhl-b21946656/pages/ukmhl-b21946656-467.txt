451 was lacerated, the bowel was returned, the wound was retained together by straps and simple dres- sings, and, when I last visited that city, I found the man recovered, under the able care and super- intendence of the surgeons of the county hospital. I conceive it to be quite useless to dilate the ends of a divided intestine in order to remove supposed stricture, as practised by some French surgeons, be- cause this apparent stricture is the means which na- ture employs to produce a reparation of the injury ; the ends of an incised wound being always drawn asunder and everted, with a broad and bulbous lip, from the contraction of the circular fibres be- hind it, producing relatively to the inverted por- tion the appearance of a cervix, and the slitting might, in this case, be carried on as long as there remained any intestine to slit. If the opening in the parietes is small, an adhesive strap and ban- dage is sufficient ; but the openings, particularly by round shot, or shell, are sometimes so enor- mous, as to admit of the stomach, bowels, or blad- der protruding, and to require a very extensive use of the suture, with the assistance of bandage and adhesive straps. The introduction of sindons of linen, and plates of lead, have also been used ; and in those cases, an ingenious French surgeon (M. Desport) has proposed, in the 3d Volume of the Memoirs of the Academy of Surgery, a peculiar mode of performing the gastroraphy, by which the thread sufficiently supports the part, and may bo loosened at will.

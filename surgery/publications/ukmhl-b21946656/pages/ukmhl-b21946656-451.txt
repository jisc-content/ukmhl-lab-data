43J Schmucker, the great Prussian army-surgeon, has some interesting cases in his “ \7r.hrnemungen but Pechlinus, in his “ Observationum Physico- Medicarum libri tres,” published at Kiel in ltj82, has given perhaps the most minute diary on record of a wound of the chest, in which the blood lost amounted to an enormous quantity. In this coun- try, Mr John Bell has given an animated and inte- resting account of these injuries, in his Discourses on Wounds; and Dr Halliday, Surgeon to the Forces, has collected and detailed nearly all the experiments and observations of preceding authors, with some cases of his own, in his work on “ Em- physema.” Wounds of the Abdomen, Pelvis, &c. These injuries are extremely severe in their nature, and very dubious in their results; like other wounds, they divide themselves into those af- fecting the containing and contained parts. In their treatment the violence of symptoms is to be combated more by general means than by any of the mechanical aids of surgery. The search for extraneous bodies, unless superficially situated, is altogether out of the question, except it can be felt by the probe, as in Ravaton’s case, (Chir. D’Armee, p. -41,) or in cases of lodgment in the bladder.

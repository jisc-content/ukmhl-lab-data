This man was soon discharged cured, having recovered quickly after the operation.

This matter sometimes involves the neighbouring joints, and occasions incurable anchylosis, which is a still more certain consequence if the surfaces of both bones are injured, in which case, each contri- butes its proportion of osseous granulations, in which the sound portions of bone become imbedded. The removal of the limb is in these cases frequent- ly our only remedy. In some cases, this osseous deposit is not confin- ed to the immediate vicinity of the injured bones. I have in my possession some specimens, where an irregular osseous fungus has sprouted out, as it were, from the sound shaft of the bone, one or two inches from the mass of disease, and completely detached ; this operation has taken place in some instances at several distant points at the same time, and all the fungi have become successively involved in the advancing and increasing deposit. In some cases, these osseous exudations appear

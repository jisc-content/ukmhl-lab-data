Some cases of the effect of pressure upon it from internal causes, and some of the experiments of Gallois in France, and Philip and Clift in England, * open a wide and interesting field for inquiry, which the difficulties attendant on examining the Theca Vertebralis ought not to deter us from pursuing. Where the powers of life, therefore, are obviously sinking, stimulants, both general and local, as wine, tether, warm friction, blisters, &c., may be used, followed up, if active inflammation should show it- self, by the depleting plan. It is from the neighbourhood of the spinal mar- row, and the great nerves proceeding from it, that all wounds of the bony pyramid derive their great- est interest; extensive injuries, or permanent lodg- * Le Gallois, Experiences sur les Principes de la Vrie, 8vo, Paris, 1812.

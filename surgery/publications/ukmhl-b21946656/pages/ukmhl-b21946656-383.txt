abstraction of more blood is necessary. I am con- vinced that mischief, rather than good, has been often done in the inflammatory affections of this insulated organ, by profuse general blood-letting. The bony circle, forming the exterior paitof the orbit, is often the seat of gunshot injuries, par- ticularly the superciliary ridges, the frontal sinuses, and generally the whole of the bone in which they lie ; and, I may here take occasion to confirm an observation made by the accurate Pott, as far as has come within my own experience, that the in- juries of “ this bone are, by no means, so com- monly dangerous or fatal as those affecting other bones of the cranium.” Universal experience has now pointed out the safety and facility of trepan- ning every part of it, including the sinuses, in which balls are frequently seen completely buried, with extensive depressions of the inner table, which nothing short of the operation can remove.

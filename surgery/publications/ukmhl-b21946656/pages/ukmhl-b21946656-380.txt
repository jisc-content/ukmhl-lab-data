The upper half appeared as if occupied by an exudation of lymph. The pupil was so dilated, that scarce a trace of iris was to be seen ; it was barely marked by a coloured circular line. Diplopia sometimes, though rarely, takes place from gunshot wounds in the neighbourhood of the eye. The following case occurred in a sol- dier of the 33d regiment at Waterloo :â€” CASE. A. 13. received a wound from a musket-ball, which brushed along the root of the nose, and on- wards towards the right eye-brow, but without producing any injury to the bone, and so little ge- neral derangement, that the wound healed in a very fewr days.

346 and at four o’clock p. m. he expired in the greatest apparent agony. I was naturally anxious to in- spect the body, but a very few hours after death it became highly offensive ; and the young gentlemen were so much afraid that it would spoil altogether before my avocations permitted me to examine it, that they removed the head with the intention of throwing in an injection to trace the state of the vessels, and discover, if possible, the ruptured one, which we all along suspected. But before the ne- cessary apparatus could be got, putrefaction ad- vanced so rapidly, that it was determined to saw off the skull-cap, and place the brain in a basin of water for inspection. Professor Thomson and Dr Somerville assisted us. We found that the right he- misphere of the cerebral mass was reduced to a sort of bloody pulp, still retaining some shape of what it had been, but much diminished in size, and rendering it absolutely impossible to trace its or- ganization. The left hemisphere, although ob- viously suffering from disease, was not so much af- fected, but was covered with a net-work of turgid vessels.* ♦ The remarkably rapid putrefaction of dead bodies after injuries of the ^ead, has been long since observed, particularly by Uiklanus, Cent. II. Obs. 25, 26, and by Morgagni, Lpist. 51, Art. 57, and Epist. 52. Art. 15. I have had repeated oppor- tunities of witnessing it. The same rapid putrefaction takes place in animals killed by lightning, and in those who have been killed in electrical experiments.

The skin was dry and parched, the tongue foul and loaded with a yellowish sordes, the pulse hard, full, and bounding ; the bowels univer- sally constipated ; occasionally severe pain in the head, and in some instances delirium. The fever was constantly present with the sloughing. I have reason to suppose that the sloughing in some cases preceded the fever; but in all the others, as nearly as. could be traced by attentive inspection of the sores. * Three hundred men were collected in this hospital, the majority desperately, not to say incurably, wounded. Among them were one hundred andforty compoundfractures, viz. S6 of the thigh, 48 of the leg, and 6 of the arm. They had been collected all over the country by the peasantry, and dragged from barn to barn, often without food or dressings, and did not arrive at Brussels until various periods, from the 8th to the 13th day after they were wounded ! It must have been to some of these men recently brought in, that Mr Charles Bell alludes at p. 319 of his Quarterly Report, Part III., where he de- scribes the state of a wound â€œ fourteen days after its inflic- tion when nothing has been done" Assuredly no body of men ever laboured harder in the cause of humanity than the Bri- tish surgeons after the battle of Waterloo. w

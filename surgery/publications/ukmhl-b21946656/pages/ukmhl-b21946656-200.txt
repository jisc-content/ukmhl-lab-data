184- notice. To pressure, and to styptics, we must give their due value, and a full trial to such an extent as prudence may warrant; but it is to the actual ligature of the vessel that we are to trust in all cases where a trunk or important branch is injured; and in cutting for them, correct anatomical know- ledge is our only resource. Often, unfortunately too often, we find, that even this will not enable us to meet the exigencies of actual practice, and that the mere anatomist has made but one step to being a perfect surgeon ; a principal one, indeed, but no more conclusive, than the tributary arts of the chi- sel or the pencil, are, to the formation of a perfect architect. Much unmerited blame has been thrown on army surgeons, on this as well as other points ; by men who, with a minute knowledge of the natu- ral structure, have not adverted to the pathology of wounded vessels. They prick for arteries in a dead subject, and they readily lind them ; but the state of a blood-vessel in a wounded limb is very essentially different from what it is in a sound state, or in a body laid on the table for the prac- tical purposes of anatomy; and I have more than once seen a person of this class; after having cut upon a living blood-vessel with the utmost preci- sion, and described its course with the most lau- dable minuteness, confess, with great surprise, that he was unable to secure it, and had actually left his patient much worse than he found him.

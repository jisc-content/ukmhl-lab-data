The natural efforts at exfoliation commence at different periods, and its progress is rapid in pro- portion to the smaller or greater solidity of the bone, or the state of the periosteum; the separa- tion of the scale or piece being always more rapid in proportion as it is more or less deprived of that vitally important membrane. A method for the excitement of exfoliation in carious cases, or the removal of the sequestra of bones in a state of necrosis, has been long a desi- deratum among surgeons, and has produced seve- ral contradictoiy and some ludicrous remedies. Rasping, burning, boring, and cutting, have all

At some hospitals, one set of operations failed, another had its peculiar fatalities, each proportioned, no doubt, to the number of cases of any prevalent disease for the treatment of which the hospital surgeons were celebrated, or the district remarkable ; while, in the larger esta- blishments, dedicated to the promiscuous recep- tion of all cases, every operation, however trifling, was attended with unsuccessful results. Atmos- pheric influence, and all the absurdities of astrolo- gy were called in by our fathers to explain this simultaneous deterioration of their patients, and various and discordant states of the air were charg- ed with the ill effects, which proceeded in a great * M.

Vol. 36. It is not consistent with my plan to enlarge on it here ; but I trust some ol the able army physicians, who served in Spain, will favour us with their observations on it. Pringle affords an inestimable model for all works of this nature.

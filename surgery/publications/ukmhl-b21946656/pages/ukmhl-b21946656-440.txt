The long and distant range of parts through which the blood passes, prevents the detection of the cause immediately; and, indeed, could we even discover it, I am not aware of any effectual mode of securing the bleeding vessels. In the cases I have met, the blood has been effused in large quantities, and has descended nearly to the sacrum, dissecting the interstices of the muscles completely, and giving to the posterior part of the thorax and the loins, that appearance said by Va- lentin to designate sanguineous effusions into the sac of the pleura. * The supra-scapular vessels are sometimes the source of fatal hemorrhage when wounded.

In many subjects, however well the tour- niquet may have been originally placed, we find a general oozing from the face of the incision, and sometimes the arteries themselves still discharging small jets of blood. When the discharge, from whatever cause, is large, and particularly in very weakly subjects, where a single jet of arterial blood is of vital consequence, I never hesitate, in tying the vessels before proceeding any farther, giving the ends of the ligatures to an assistant un- til the bone is sawed through. This may, to some, appear a very informal proceeding; and I have heard it criticised as not being according to the rules of the schools ; but a consideration of the safety of our patient should be our only direction, and in no particular should we sacrifice what the dictates of common sense and experience point out as neces- sary to ensure it, to the rigid formality of rules, or the pitiful pedantry of never deviating from them.* On the same principle, we should never hesitate, if we find the bone much splintered, or diseased, or protruding after the limb is removed, or even ifj by * Where the great veins bleed, I have never hesitated about tying them also, and it is most particularly necessary in debi- litated subjects. 1 have met with only one case of venous hemorrhage to be fairly traced to contraction of the integu- ments, as observed by Mr llcy in his Chapter on Amputation ; nor did it require an incision of the integuments, as practised by him, but was relieved by loosening the bandages, and moistening the dressings with cold water.

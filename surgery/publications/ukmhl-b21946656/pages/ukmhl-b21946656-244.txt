The nights were, however, generally cold, cloudy, and moist. No epidemic disease occurred among the in- habitants during our occupation of this station. They were remarkably healthy and robust, and numerous instances of longevity were to be met with among them. The topography of the Cor- deleria was not more favourable towards its selec- tion as an hospital, than the interior of the build- ing was comfortable, and adapted to the purpose. It was 1200 feet long, by 40 broad, and lG in height, well plastered and floored, and raised 12 feet above the surface.

These are the cases where a ball, pass- ing close to, or between the artery and vein of a limb, but without primarily opening either, has so far predisposed the parts to sloughing, that an eventual varicose aneurism is formed. The following case illustrates the progress and symptoms of this injury of the blood-vesselS, and the fatality of operation. I shall briefly relate it, premising that moderate pressure, open bowels, and abstinence from every species of excess, form the rational mode of treatment; and that, if operation is deemed necessary, ample time should be allowed for the growth or enlargement of anastomosing and collateral vessels ; and a much longer period, it is to be observed, will be required in a case of this kind, than in that where the whole undiminished force of the ventricle, and of the peculiar arterial action which prolongs the impulse, is employed up- on the column of blood. * CASE.

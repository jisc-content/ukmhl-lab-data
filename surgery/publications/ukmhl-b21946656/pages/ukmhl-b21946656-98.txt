On the third day, a large ball was plainly felt, lying near the edge of the sartorius muscle, and apparently in contact with the femoral artery ; but still re- ceding from it if the position of the limb was changed. I now' made a cautious puncture over the site of the ball, which was followed by the discharge of about a pound of very foetid matter, mixed with clots of blood, and a ball of large size could be felt by the probe and finger.

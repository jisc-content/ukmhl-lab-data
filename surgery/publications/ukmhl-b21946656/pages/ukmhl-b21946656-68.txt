the field ; and we are yet, I fear, in want of ma- chinery to keep it steady during the journey to the rear. We are guided by the same princi- ples in cases where balls have passed through, or but partially injured, the hand or foot. In open sabre cuts, thrusts from pikes, bay- onets, or small swords, we may commence our plan of cure upon the field. After cleaning away the blood and filth, and remov ing any extraneous matter wilhin our reach, we lay the lips of the wound neatly together with straps, or, if neces- sary and practicable, with ligatures, and support the part with a bandage ; or, if it is a deep thrust, we lay a compress along its course, and bind it up moderately tight. If the joints or cavities are injured, we employ the lancet unre- servedly, and administer a brisk purgative: ff the intestines are cut, and hang from the w ound, we secure them by a few close stitches to the lips : if they are sound, we replace them, and close theorilice with ligatures and straps. In all contusions, sprains, lacerations, or bums, from the explosion of detached cartridges or ammunition waggons, little more can or ought to be done, than cleaning I he parts and applying compresses dipped in ol. terebinth, or liniment saponis, or acetous acid and water, as may be convenient ; and, if there is a great loss of substance, pledgets spread with some mild ointment.

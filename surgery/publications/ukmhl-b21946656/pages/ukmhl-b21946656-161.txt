145 of the balls spontaneously presented at the orifice, and another came away in a cataplasm. Although a recurrence to more ample incisions was pronoun- ced the only chance for the poor fellow’s recovery, no further operation was attempted ; but by minute attention to dressings, supporting his strength, and, above all, moving him to another hospital which enjoyed a purer air, the fracture consolidated, a very few minute splinters were easily removed by the dressing forceps, and the man recovered. In some instances, though more rarely, no ap- parent exfoliation whatever takes place, notwith- standing that the bone is considerably shattered and exposed to the air, a cause which so frequently occasions its death and separation. Nothing but the youth and sound constitution of the patient, which admits of the recovery of the injured mem- brane, and the cleaning of the ulceration of the bone, can account for this. The more minute scales or comminuted portions are carried off by the flow of purulent matter, either totally unob- served, or in small palpable particles. Deep incisions will, indeed, often produce ex- foliations, but they are then the consequence of the unnecessary injuries inflicted by the surgeon, and not the result of nature’s efforts at regenera- tion. I might produce a great mass of evidence illustrative of the propriety of patiently waiting the event, and not hurrying into operations under the false idea that exfoliation must necessarily follow L

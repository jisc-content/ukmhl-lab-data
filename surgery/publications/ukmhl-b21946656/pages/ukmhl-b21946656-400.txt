384 caution in the employment of antimonials, which we find so useful in other cases, where the rigid antiphlogistic plan is to be enforced. Their eme- tic or nauseating effects render their use at least ambiguous ; and, although they had no unplea- sant effect in Colonel C.â€™s case, I confess I should not use them again in such another. Wounds of the larynx and trachea, if uncon- nected with any of the neighbouring parts, or not attended with much hemorrhage, are not pe- culiarly dangerous, although they are very slow at times in healing. In the upper part of the tube the cartilages sometimes become ulcerated, and throw out large fungous excrescences, and hoarseness, amounting almost to complete apho- nia, takes place. Emphysema is also a frequent, though not a dangerous symptom of wounds of this description ; indeed, I have met with it oftener in wounds of the larynx and trachea than in those of the lungs, probably because the action of the muscles subser- vient to respiration, is exerted in such a manner as to send a current of air through the larynx, whence it is driven forcibly into the cellular sub- stance. Simple puncture is, in those cases, the best remedy. In some cases of injuries of the trachea, inflam- mation takes place in such a high degree as to spread by continuous sympathy to the lungs them- selves, and produce very aggravated forms of pneu-

This man was subsequently at- tached to the mule with my medical stores, and repeatedly consulted me on the means of recover- ing his virility, which, he said, the shell had com- pletely carried away with it. It becomes an object of inquiry, on which Mr Hughes could not satisfy me, Did Gaetano lose any other function, the organ of which was in- jured ? The organ of parental affection, according to the position assigned it by Gall and Spurzheim, must have been implicated. Was he as good a fa- ther as ever, or did he cease to love children when lie lost the power of begetting them ? Some of the functions, particularly of the mind, are often severely and permanently affected, while others are not proportionally impaired, and the loss is of but temporary duration. The powers of speech are often lost while those of memory remain, and the sight is impaired while the hearing is perfect, and vice versa. I have met numerous instances of this, and have had patients who told me that they could hear distinctly what I said, and distinguish my voice from that of others,â€”and have repeated my words as a proof both of this fact and of their retention of memory, while they could not distin- guish my person or give utterance to their thoughts. The following case, in which I was deeply inte- rested, illustrates this point.

The fewer extra articles, therefore, that he orders, he may rest assured, the better for his patients ; to pre- vent all mistakes, the diet should be regularly marked by his own hand at the bed-side : and if wine or spirits are allowed, they should be inva- riably given under his own eye, or mixed with his patientâ€™s medicine*. It is obvious that whatever arrangements facilitate the execution of the duties, must ulti- mately benefit the wounded ; and a conscien- tious officer will employ the time saved to him in this way in redoubled exertions for the benefit of those committed to his care, and endeavour to identify his own comfort and convenience with those of his patient. Punctuality of attendance, preparing dressings and medicines in the inter- vals of the visits, and a regular registration of cases, will enable any man of common industry to acquit himself with credit in his situation ; while men with the purest and most scientific views, without those mechanical helps, exhaust their strength and redouble their toil. * Vide Appendix.

3*8 Concussion, as well as compression, is a very frequent effect of fracture from shot or sabre wounds, and also from grazing round shot, and fragments of shell, earth, or stones. The diseases are frequently coexistent, and so often run into each other, or differ merely in degree, as to render it impossible in every case to lay down accurate dis- tinctive marks between them. Neither the state of the pulse, the eye, the breathing, or the skin, are infallible guides • we have an unerring one, how- ever, in our most powerful remedy, if not to the precise nature of the case, at least to its most pro- per treatment,—I mean venesection ; and the younger surgeon who allows himself to be seduced by representations of the impropriety of copious bleeding in soldiers, will deprive himself of a most important and useful auxiliary when judiciously em- ployed. No well informed man now-a-days, it is true, flies to the lancet the moment he hears of a wound of the head. He examines the case, and, from appearances, decides on the immediate neces- sity of abstracting that blood, which he well knows he must ultimately have recourse to when reaction takes place. If the concussion is so violent that the powers of life are absolutely sinking, to bleed instantly would be to destroy the patient. A glass of wine or of spirits poured down his throat will be the proper remedy. If the wound is not attended with great sinking, which is often fatal, then in- deed the lancet and a brisk purgative are the ap-

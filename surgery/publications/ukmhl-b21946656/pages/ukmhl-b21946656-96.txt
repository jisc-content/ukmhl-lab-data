In the last class, which are by far the most troublesome and dangerous, are included splin- ters of bone of all sizes, eoagula, and sloughs. It may be asked, how can such large masses possibly be contained in a limb, or lie among muscles without being betrayed by their bulk1? The explanation is not difficult; the immense rapidity with which they are propelled not only forces them into the soft parts, but compacts those parts so closely together, as nearly to an- nihilate them ; and the place they occupied is filled by the projected body. When however, after some time the living fibre recovers sufficient tone, the natural tume- faction which necessarily precedes the throwing off the dead matter, soon produces such a de- gree of pain, as gives notice of the troublesome guest. Sometimes where the constitution is less irritable, or the wounded parts possess but little sensibility, or where the foreign body is small and polished, or may have formed a secure bed for itself in the belly of a muscle, or in an in- terstitial space, no derangement whatever suc- ceeds ; and the part heals up as if no extraneous body was present. I shall offer a few curious cases on this subject ; the following was stated publicly at the time of its occurrence :

310 determination to the head on hard drinking, a f un- nel-like depression, to the depth of an inch and half, was formed in the vertex. I am in possession of several other instances of a similar kind. We have here sufficient proof that there is no absolute necessity for trepanning merely for de- pressed bones from gunshot, although few would be so hardy as not to remove all fragments that came easily and readily away. We would also na- turally remove all extraneous bodies within view or reach ; but before we commence any unguided search after them, we ought seriously to balance the injury that we may inflict. I by no means wish to be understood to say, that we ought not to endeavour cautiously to follow the course of a ball, when un- fortunately it has got within the cavity of the cra- nium. M. Larrey asserts that it can be done with safety and with effect. He informs us, that he traced a ball which entered the frontal sinus of a soldier during the insurrection at Cairo, by means of an elastic bougie, from the orifice to the occipital suture, in the direct course of the longitudinal si- nus, and by a corresponding measurement exter- nally he was enabled successfully to apply a trepan over it and extract it. The patient recovered. M. Percy, on the other hand, gives us a fatal instance, where a ball was absolutely within reach of the for- ceps, and yet for want of a sufficient opening and manual dexterity in the operator, it slipped into the brain j and although the opening was enlarged

After an action we meet with one or both partially injured, or blown completely out, or the ball passing through the upper part of the nose and leaving an arch, or removing it altogether; sometimes it passes behind them, destroying their power, either by cutting the optic nerves at once, or causing their subsequent inflammation and thick- ening. An additional proof of the decussation of these nerves is afforded by the effects of gunshot wounds of the eye ; for in many instances an injury by a ball inflicted in the neighbourhood of one, produces paralysis of the other. Sometimes the ball enters straight forward, destroys the organiza- tion of the eye, and lodges in a variety of parts, in the brain, the orbit, under the zygoma, or in the soft parts, and sometimes its course cannot be as- certained during life. Pierre Roussillier, of the 25th regiment of the line, in the service of Na- poleon, was wounded on the 18th June at Wa- terloo. The ball entered the right eye ; the left, though not in the slightest degree injured to ap- pearance, was completely blind.

that of the hospitals in which they are placed. It does not come within the limits I have pre- scribed to myself, to enter at large into the detail of the various species of fevei which appear in mi- litary hospitals, or supervene upon wounds. I shall, however, make a few observations on some points which appear to me of considerable importance to be attended to by the less experienced practitioner.

Its invasion, which is most ge- nerally influenced by the violence of the injury, the irritability of the patient, or the importance of the injured parts, is sometimes remarkably re- tarded, so as to give rise to very fallacious hopes ; and whether it is, that this violence is only sus- pended to acquire additional force, or that its late appearance throws both patient and surgeon off their guard, in the very important point of diet, it so happens, that those cases are generally the most ambiguous in their results.

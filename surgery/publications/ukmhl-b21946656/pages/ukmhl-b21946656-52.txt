36 and, instead of going through, or perhaps dying o(f at a tangent, and striking the breast, go ail round between the shirt and skin, furrowing the latter, and going out at the point of the shoulder, thus describing a portion of the circumference of a circle. In mounted officers also 1 have seen this propensity to go on a concave surface, where the ball has struck the outside of the calf, and, liom the bent position of the knee, has been thrown up into, or above, the popliteal space, rendering all search after it useless for a long time. Indeed, one emiuent London surgeon, who was consulted in a case of a general officer whom I attended, and who had been wounded in this very way, could not believe that the ball had lodged at all: it was discovered, however, by a Parisian professor, where I asserted it would be found ; for its entrance had been clearly de- monstrated by an abscess, which formed in its course, and discharged, on being opened, se- veral pieces of stocking and pantaloon, with several clots of blood ; but the most accurate and patieut investigation could not detect it for several months. In six fatal eases which l very minutely ex- amined, this occasional course on a concave surface was very visible. In two, the ball passed between the lungs and pleura costalis, enter- ing on the right of the sternum, coursing round, and passing at nearly an equal distance through

440 health and appearance are in as good a state as be- fore the receipt of the injury. * Balls very frequently pass clean through the abdomen, evidently wounding the intestines, but without occasioning any protrusion of them at either o 1 the orifices. These cases, like all others of those parts, 'are extremely dangerous, but are not necessarily mortal. They require the most guarded attention, and the utmost watchfulness of the approach of inflammation, which comes on often most insidiously, and as often insidiously goes off, but not before the destruction of the patient is effectually sealed. The mildest possible appli- cation should be employed to the wounds, and no plugging with tents, or introduction of medicated dressings thought of. Sometimes the effusion of the contents of the intestines takes place very soon after the receipt of a wound ; in other cases, espe- cially of gunshot, it does not appear until the eschars separate. In either case, excessive in- flammation is what we have to dread, and the lan- cet alone is our remedy, used, not at stated inter- vals, or for measured evacuations, but unhesitat- ingly employed, whenever pain and tension call * Other cases of a similar nature have come to my know- ledge, and many are to be met with in ltavaton, Schenc- kius, Mangetus, and Hildanus, as quoted by Percy; to which I would add Pare, lib. 25. chap. 19> and Sandifort, who gives three instances in his Thesaurus, Yrol.

124 I shall briefly state vvliat appears to me the most rational mode of treating these very com- plicated injuries, and which I exclusively adopt, from a conviction of its merits, drawn from a comparison with other plans ; premising that 1 shall suppose the more serious cases (which I have already laid down as calling for amputa- tion on the field) have been operated on, or at least marked for operation, when circumstances, as fever, high inflammation, or excessive col- lapse, may permit; and repeating, that 1 am well convinced the sum of human misery tv ill be most materially lessened by permitting no amhi- guous case to be subjected to the trial of /reserv- ing the limb ; constitution, convenience for treat- ment, and local circumstances, having their full weight in the decision. A very short time after a compound fracture is inflicted, a re-action, influenced in its violence and the period of its attack by the severity of the case, the original constitution of the patient, or the accidental circumstances of the wound, always takes place. During this re-action, the process of ossification is completely at a stand ; and indeed, throughout the whole cure, the high inflammatory and suppurative actions are incom- patible with the formation of bone.

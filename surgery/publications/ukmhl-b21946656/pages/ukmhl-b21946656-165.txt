Where the patient can move about, exfolia- tions are often remarkably promoted by moderate exercise of the affected limb. While using the very simple machinery of Hilsea Hospital, here- after to be described, I was much struck by this circumstance. A great deal is no doubt to be at- tributed to the improved health, which admits of, and is connected with exercise, and respiring a pure air out of the wards of an hospital; but I con- ceive much is also to be referred to the mechanical action of the muscular fibres upon those points of bone into which they are inserted, and which, if loosened from the main mass by disease, must cer- tainly be considerably influenced by a steady and protracted natural force acting upon them, without the aid of surgical instruments, or the violence of operations.

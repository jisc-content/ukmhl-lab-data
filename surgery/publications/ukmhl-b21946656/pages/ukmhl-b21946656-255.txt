It can scarce- ly be confounded with any other disease or any spe- cies of ulcers ; it may indeed be mistaken by name (and I have seen this happen) for common gan- grene, but the points of difference are very strik- ing. It does not proceed from impaired organiza- tion of the parts, nor is it necessarily preceded by inflammation, cold, or pressure ; its progress is in- finitely more rapid, and, when its. course is checked, separation takes place in detached specks instead of the icaving line. It is also often attended with hemorrhage, which rarely occurs in common gan- grene. The two diseases, indeed, are frequently coexistent, and I have seen numerous instances of the lower part of a limb gangrenous from pressure, while a sore highly infected with hospital gan- grene has occupied the upper part. To those who have seen such cases, or have had opportunities of comparing the difference of appearances of the diseased parts in two individuals, the diagnosis can never be difficult. The skin and cellular substance, whether loose I. er condensed, seemed to be the parts originally and principally affected in the disease at Bilbao. This was obvious, even in the living body, but on dissec- tion, the disease of these parts frequently was ob- served to spread much further than external appear-

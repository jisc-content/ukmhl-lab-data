288 the retraction of’ the muscles, or of a false calcula- tion of the necessary quantity to be left, a protru- sion is probable, to take up the saw again and re- move the necessary portion ; by doing it on the spot, much after pain and misery is avoided. In the fore-arm almost every possible error of projecting bone or insufficient covering is effectual- ly obviated by the flap operation. This is best per- formed with the fore-arm extended, the thumb and little finger in a perpendicular line, and forming the guiding points to the formation of two neat semilunar flaps, which are to be cut out either by the catlin from within outwards, or the middle-sized incision knife in the opposite direction. Cases will occur where the hand or foot are only partially injured. By taking advantage of the joints and of the sound teguments, we very often succeed in saving the limb, and making a tolerable stump, by throwing the cicatrix out of the line of pressure ; but no general rule can be laid down for those cases, almost every one of which will require some peculiar management. In putting up stumps, I have constantly prac- tised the perpendicular cicatrix, supporting the parts after the application of the usual adhesive straps, with a band of plaster about three fingers’ breadth, put moderately tight round the whole, so as gently but steadily to compress all the parts, particularly those that are concerned in the process of adhesion around the eud of the stump ; and, to-

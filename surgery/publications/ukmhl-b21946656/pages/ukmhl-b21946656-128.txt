112 any rational chance of saving it exists, must be a serious object to the patient, and a desirable result tor the surgeon. 1 have already observed, that some information may be derived from the appearance of a ball after being cut or extracted from a wound. Where it has brushed obliquely by a bone, and injured its external plate, its surface is often jagged, and presents the appearance of a file clogged with raspings of ivory. Some- times it is flattened against the bone without doing such material injury to the periosteum as to occasion exfoliation ; but more frequently, long and tedious throwing off of scales follows the injury. In some cases it will take out a portion of the diameter of the bone ; and in others, though more rarely, perforate the shaft completely without entirely fracturing it. More common instances of this perforation occur in the spongy heads of bones, as the humerus and tibia; in all these cases the injury is compara- tively simple in the recent state, and our duty is confined to watching the approach of inflam- mation, and removing any splinters, &c. that may present or come within our reach. In their after-stages, however, these perforating wounds of the cylindrical bones become of most serious import, and almost constantly turn out cases for secondary amputation. In some severe cases, where the ball lodges in the bone, particularly about the condyles, by

116 A curious instance of a ball lodging in bone is given us by Par&. It is a very rare occurrence, but the case is valuable on many accounts. “ The “ King of Navarre,” says he, “ was hurt with “ a bullet in the shoulder a few days before the “ assault of Rouen, anno 1562. I visited and “ helped to dress him, with Master Gilbert of “ Montpellier, his own surgeon, and others; they “ could not find the bullet; I searched for it “ very exactly; I perceived by conjecture, that “ it had entered by the head of the adjutorium, “ and that it had run into the cavity of the said “ bone. The most part of them said it was en- “ tered and lost within the body. Monsieur, the “ Prince of Roehe-upon-Yon, who intimately “ loved the King of Navarre, cal led me aside and “ asked if the wound was mortal. I told him “ yea, because all wounds made in great joints “ and principally contused ones, were mortal.” Pare remained steady to his prognostic, always declaring that the limb would fall into gangrene, which it did, and the King died on the eighteenth day after the wound. A dissection was ordered, stance of this contraction of the orifice. In the brute crea- tion, under certain circumstances, it closes altogether, ami littfe inconvenience seems to be felt; thus, on cutting pieces of ivory, metallic balls are sometimes found bedded within them without any mark of their entrance. They must obviously have entered tlie pulp before the secretion of enamel, to cover the adult tooth, had taken place.

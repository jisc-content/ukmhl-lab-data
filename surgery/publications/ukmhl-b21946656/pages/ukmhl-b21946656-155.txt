In some places they will lie in small irregular masses, hanging by very slender membranous filaments, and easily separable by the finger or probe, or even by simple agitation in water. In others, they will form a continuous surface of some extent and various depths, and will seem like an incomplete sheath or irregular envelope thrown over or around the injured bone, studded as it were on its inside face with hard bony particles; and often, if the living bone is examined, a corresponding granulated tissue or efflorescence will be observable on it, as if pro- ceeding to meet the former. All these pheno- mena clearly appear to depend upon the action of the periosteum, whether adhering to the liv- ing extremity of the fractured bone, or separated entirely from it; but still possessing vascularity and life by its connection with the soft parts. The following case, selected from many others, affords a very striking example of this kind : CASE. A soldier of the 4th regiment of infantry re- ceived a wound at the storming of Badajos from a musket slug, which brushed over the course of the femoral artery, nearly about its dipping under the sartorius, and passed through poste-

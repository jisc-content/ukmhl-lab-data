157 found to connect the new formation to the origi- nal epiphysis, while the old bony shaft is in various stages of decay. If the necrosed part be examined, while nature is in full work, that part of the new bone most recently deposited, can always be very readily known by a beautiful distinctive mark ; the external periosteal covering is thickened, red to the eye, and when peeled off*, the subjacent parts, be- fore they are clean washed, give exactly the ap- pearance of a piece of parboiled pork, from which the rind has been torn ; the surface of the bony crust is covered with dots where last deposited, while, when of older date, it is covered with sulci, formed apparently from several dots being united in parallel lines, by the absorption of the solid inter- stitial spaces, which at first existed between them. It sometimes happens, that the head or neck of a bone is perforated, or grooved by a ball, and that no very severe symptoms call for the amputation of the limb immediately, but the effects of the injury are propagated to various distances, from the point of its infliction, to the very extremity of the affected bone. In Mr Vanceâ€™s collection, there is a most re- markable instance of this; the whole surface of the head of the humerus is rough and diseased; immedi- ately at the neck necrosis has taken place, and has spread over the entire shaft; and at the condyles, it becomes again diseased like the head, but without the smallest appearance of the regeneration of bone. This is very illustrative of some valuable patholo- gical facts, and naturally suggests a practical call-

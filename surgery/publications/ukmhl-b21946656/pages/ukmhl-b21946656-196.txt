180 amounts so near to certainty, that a bare possibili- ty of escape is left, and no practical deduction can be drawn from a few solitary instances to the con- trary. It must be recollected, however, that if a limb is entirely carried off, or if it is excessively bruised, little or no bleeding takes place ; the ves- sels are paralyzed, and their organization almost destroyed ; the effect is nearly the same as if they had been actually seared, a process to which the older surgeons, who were so familiar with hot irons, often compared it. A very singular instance of escape is given by M. Larrey in his Memoires, in which an Aide-de-camp received a gunshot wound, which cut the external carotid at its separation from the internal, and at its passage through the parotid gland. Pressure from the fingers of an in- telligent soldier upon the spot, and M. Larrey’s subsequent bandages, saved the patient. I know of an English officer who was also saved in India from the effects of an arrow wound in the carotid by the same means. In the 9th vol. of the New Medical and Physical Journal, p. 95, is given the case of a man wounded in the femoral artery at Spithead, and saved by a subsequent operation at Haslar Hos- pital ; and in the 3d vol. of the Medico-Chirurgi- cal Journal, page ‘2, is given an instance of the ca- rotid bursting and being taken up on the spot by the late Mr Fleming, a naval surgeon. We have occasional opportunities in the field of at once tying the extremities of lacerated arte-

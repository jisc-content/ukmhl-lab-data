519 their humanity, and for the perfect cure he owed to their attention, he observed, “ that so little in- convenience did he feel, that, could it benefit the Emperor, he would willingly receive a ball in the other side! 1” This lodgment of balls does not destroy the restorative powers of nature, as the fractured and separated pieces of bone often make a con- siderable progress towards perfect reunion. Mr Hammick, surgeon of Plymouth Royal Naval Hospital, has a very remarkable preparation illus- trative of this fact. A large part of the frontal bone, nearly four inches in circumference, includ- ing the superciliary ridge and subjacent frontal sinus, is carried outward and overlaps the tem- poral fossa $ the bony union is nearly complete ; while a musket ball is lodged deep in the anterior lobe of the brain. The man from whom the pre- paration was taken was wounded in Spain, and died at the distance of two months after in Plymouth. * Lodgment of balls, and great depression of the bones, will often exist unsuspected and unnoticed for days, until an inflammatory disposition is ex- cited by some errors of diet, or other accidental oc- currence, when all the symptoms burst forth at once. The following case strongly illustrates this. * Mr Gooch gives an instance of a musket-ball in the brain, the patient recovering, and Ramtlhor another in the “ Ver- tnischte Chirurgischc Schriften” of Schmucker, in which the patient survived four weeks.

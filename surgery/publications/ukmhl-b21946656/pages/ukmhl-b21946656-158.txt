142 (which always separates) became distended with fluid, the sound part of the periosteum was forced up by the pressure on it. Be this, however, as it may ; Nature had made most con- siderable progress towards the formation of a new bone in the short period of three weeks, solely, as it appeared, by the agency of that membrane. This bony exudation from the pe- riosteum is still oftener apparent where ampu- tation is obliged to be performed a second time, from causes which I shall hereafter mention ; or where, the operation being already performed, the patient falls a victim to the irritation of a diseased bone. Professsor Weidman* has collected a num- ber of authorities on this point* and particularly relates an instance where Justamond had re- moved a necrosed bone by gouge and mallet; but having totally destroyed the periosteum, no bone was ever regenerated afterwards. The practical inferences to be drawn from this power of the periosteum, are particularly > valuable as guides to the boundaries we should ascribe to the extraction of splinters from com- pound fractures. If the splinter is large and adherent at many points, and particularly if it * The Professorâ€™s excellent Latin Treatise on Necrosis is exceeding scarce; but a good translation has been published at Paris in 1808, by M. Jourda, 1 vol. 8vo. An English translation may shortly be expected by my late assistant, Dr. Knox.

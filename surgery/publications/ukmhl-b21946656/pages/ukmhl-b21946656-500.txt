484 pear, however, from Haller and others, that the brutes in many instances became more fat and sa- lacious ; and there is a recent instance on record, in which it has been successfully removed from man by Mr O’Brien, a naval surgeon, (Medico- Chirurgical Journal, 1816, Vol. I.) where it had protruded at an incised wound. This is certainly a more favourable case than if it had been injured “ in situ” where the blood from its numerous vessels might have been extravasated into the ab- dominal cavity,—a circumstance which seems to be the principal cause of the danger of its inju- ries. In some cases of wounds of the fixed viscera of the abdomen, particularly the spleen and liver, a critical hemorrhage from the wound, or a spon- taneous diarrhoea, have relieved all the urgent symp- toms, after copious purging and venesection had been employed before without effect. Some interesting observations of wounds of the spleen arc to be met with in Richter’s Bibliotheca, B. 8. p. 533, and among the older authors, as in Fallopius de Vulneribus, Chap. 87, and in Schenc- kius, Lib. 3, Obs. 104. A special dissertation on them, by Fold, is extant in Schlegel’s Collection, Vol. ir. From severe blows or bruises upon the abdo- men, very serious injuries are inflicted without the solution of external continuity, and even instant death is no unfrcquent consequence. Dissection in some instances explains those cases, but in

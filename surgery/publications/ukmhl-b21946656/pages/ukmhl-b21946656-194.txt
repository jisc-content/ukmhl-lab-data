178 under my observation, the muscular fibres have been observed either to be ruptured, or forcibly separated from each other, and sometimes absorbed to such a degree as to be unequal to the act of bending the limb. In one or two instances, an osseous deposition has been remarked on their bellies and their tendons. These cases admit of no cure. Injuries of the Blood-Vessels. It is a popular opinion among surgeons, and even soldiers, and in a great measure a well found- ed one, that a bleeding gunshot wound is highly dangerous. A small vessel or congeries of vessels suffers immediate death from the rapidly inflicted contusion of a ball, and the wound in which they lie either discharges a few sluggish drops, or its hemorrhage ceases after a momentary spirt, and a secondary kind of oozing. A moderate sized ves- sel often bleeds actively, but within the power of timely assistance. A large artery, on the contrary, pours forth its fluid contents, if not fatally from quantity, at least so from the deranged balance of circulation which its wound produces. Much of the flow in all cases will depend upon the vessel being cut quite across and admitting of retraction.

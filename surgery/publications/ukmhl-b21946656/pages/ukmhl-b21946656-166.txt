150 measures usual among British surgeons to safe a life at least, if we cannot save a soldier to the country. In determining the proper period, it is always to be kept in view, that the new envelope is much more dense when fairly formed than the original bone ; it is entirely destitute of cancelli, and the earlier the opening of it is made, the easier will it be to the operator, and the patient will be saved much misery and irritation. It should also be re- collected, that in fractured bones, when union has taken place, the medullary canal is obliterated at that part, and filled up by the new callus, which is not absorbed for a length of time. Hence, partially perforating the shaft of the bone in search of sequestra is often useless. The septum formed across the cavity will render a perforation neces- sary, above and below the union, should sequestra exist in both the upper and lower division. I shall now advert to a species of the com- minuted compound gunshot fracture* which, al- though at first of but little consequence in appear- ance, is of most serious importance in its results. This occurs where a musket ball has perforated a cylindrical bone, without totally destroying its con- tinuity, and, consequently, without producing any distortion of the limb, or other symptoms which characterize a fracture. The foundation of infinite mischief is, however, laid, for not only is the shaft of the bone injured, but fragments are carried into, and lodged in the medullary canal; and if the

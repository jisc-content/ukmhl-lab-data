337 some of the more numerous instances where death occurs from those accidents ; but I should very much deceive the inexperienced reader, did I lay down separate or invariable characteristic symp- toms of each of those causes of fatality, which all seem to have a combined share in the event: —rigors, fever, stupor, derangement of the ali- mentary canal, affection of the organs of sight, hearing, and speech, and general affection of the whole nervous system,—come on either in succes- sion or together, and cut off the sufferer. On dissection, the rupture of blood-vessels, which can be traced by the knife or injection; general ooz- ing, not referable to any set of vessels ; the ef- fusion of purulent matter ; the throwing out of layers of coagulable lymph ;—all afford instances of pressure from fluids; while fractures and de- pressions ; separation of the inner table, without any displacement of the outer; and a variety of extraneous bodies,—form the sources of pressure from solid matters. Besides these, abscesses, and even gangrene, are often detected making very extensive ravages in the body of the brain itself!; while sometimes it must be confessed that dissec- tion fails in pointing out the immediate cause of the fatal event. Examinations after death have also frequently shown effusions of blood, fissures, and fractures, the existence of which had never been suspected during life; but which, if affecting the basis of the cranium, are universally fatal. The symptoms of those cases are extremely equivocal.

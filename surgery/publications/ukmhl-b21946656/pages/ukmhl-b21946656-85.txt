In ordinary eases, however, I would recommend the sparing use of opiates ; and in the more severe, particularly if attended with fractures, we should always reserve them to the latter part of the cure, when they become so indispensably necessary. Where a temporary lowering of the system is an object of import- ance, and the use of the lancet is to be restricted, nothing is more effectual than nauseating doses of the antimonial class. It must also be kept in view, that, independently of the symptomatic fever which more or less attends all wounds, men labouring; under them and crowded tog:e- ther in large hospitals are particularly subject to the prevailing diseases of the country where they are, even though they may be complete acclimates; their irritable and debilitated state rendering them particularly obnoxious to every species of contagion common among the inha- bitants, and to some peculiar to themselves. published his Thesis in lC93 at Leyden, upon the utility of inspecting the evacuations of the sick.

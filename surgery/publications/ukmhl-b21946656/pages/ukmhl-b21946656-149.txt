133 where, if union is suspended, it is generally from mechanical obstructions, from excessive action, or from disorganization of parts. Original mal- position, or subsequent derangement of the bones, ore occasional causes of their not uniting, I have lately examined the fore arm of a naval officer, in which the radius was fractured trans- versely by a musket-ball some years since ; some of the muscles have got between the fractured ends, which are rounded by absorption ; and although, from the ulna still retaining its situa- tion, no distortion of the limb has taken place, a species of gynglimoid articulation, and a partial luxation at the wrist, is formed, which greatly detracts from the power of the limb. The ravages of disease were most extensive in the cases of compound fractures, which have remained disunited, and which I have examined after the fatal result, or after the limb has been removed. In the soft parts I have met with enor- mous abscesses extending far and wide around the fracture, so that the ends of the bones have been constantly immersed in the contents ; and the muscles in many cases, and in some, the periosteum separated for several inches from them. The infiltration of matter has extended far in the interstices, and in the fleshy bellies of the muscles themselves, in some cases, dissect- ing these organs very completely one from the other ; in others, partially destroying them ; and

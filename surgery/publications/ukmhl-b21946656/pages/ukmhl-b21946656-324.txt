Surgeon Hughes, who examined the head in the presence of a coronerâ€™s inquest, found, that the iron had entered obliquely, running a little towards the left side, slanting upwards, and penetrating the anterior lobe of the lefl hemisphere of the cere- brum to the depth of an inch. There was no ef- fusion of any kind, or any unnatural appearance, except the hole made by the weapon. With this case, it may be w ell to compare that very remark- able one mentioned by Mr Larrey, * in which the patient survived to the second day, where a ram- rod had actually passed through the os frontis ; be- tween the hemispheres of the cerebrum ; through the thick part of the sphenoidal bone ; and through the condyloid foramen of the occipital bone, with- out injuring any important organ. The preser- vation of this skull in the collection of the Faculty of Paris, places the fact beyond question. The instances of death, after the setting in of in- flammation from very trifling causes, are of almost daily occurrence, and would induce us to antici- pate its certainty after all violent injuries ; but it is a great mistake, nowr acknowledged by the best surgeons, to suppose that every depression requires an elevator, and every fracture the interference of art; although it is a common one, fallen into by * Vide Memoires, Vol. III. with a Plate. Compare also a case by Curtis, on the Diseases of India, p. 254, where a boy ran on an iron spike, and lived for twenty-six days with- out much apparent injury.

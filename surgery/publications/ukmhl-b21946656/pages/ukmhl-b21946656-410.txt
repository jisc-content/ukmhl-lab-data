When a ball has fractured one or more ribs, we must not be contented by enforcing a strict diet, but we must call in the lancet to our aid, and keep the bowels freely open with mild purgatives* and the skin in a perspirable state by antimonials and diluents, aiding our endeavours with a supporting bandage, and picking away any spioulas of bone which are within our reach. In every injury of the chest, a firm elastic bandage is an indispensable assistant in the cure ; the motions of the ribs are not only restrained, but the parts are powerfully supported by its application ; if fracture has taken place in any of the bones, we have no other means so perfect of retaining them in their place ; if a slight degree of emphysema has occurred before we see the patient, we thus prevent its further diffusion *, and if we are called on before it takes place, we may prevent the occurrence altogether.

These, however, are our most favourable cases. Next in order, though not in frequency, come wounds opening the cavity, but not injuring its con-

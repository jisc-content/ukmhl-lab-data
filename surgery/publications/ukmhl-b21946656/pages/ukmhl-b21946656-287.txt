271 pend on this state of the bowels, and a relaxation of one is best promoted by producing that state in the other. The day before an operation, the ad- ministration of a purgative is very important; serious inconveniences, and among them, hemor- rhage, are frequently owing to the irritation and repeated strainings to stool, occasioned by costive- ness. I scarcely recollect a situation in which bleeding vessels occur more frequently than in the act of passing accumulated faeces after an amputa- tion, particularly of the lower extremity. But the grand source of safety to the indivi- dual, is removal to a distant and separate ward, and, if possible, to another hospital appropriated to the cases operated upon, as soon as his removal is at all practicable. To those who have not had experience on this point, it may appear a very useless, if not a very injurious measure, thus to remove the stump patients ; but I hold it as one of the best established facts in military surgery, that a cautious and well regulated shifting of those cases from the hospitals, or, if possible, the towns in which they have been established, is one of the most certain means of insuring their ultimate re- covery. I have witnessed hundreds of cases in confirmation of this; I have seen the men, who, on the first day of a transfer from one hospital to another, have been obliged to be assisted into the boats or waggons, or held on mules ; enjoy a sound nightâ€™s repose, awake with a craving appetite.

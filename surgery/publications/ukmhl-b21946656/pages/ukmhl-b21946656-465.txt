By his experiments also on brutes, he confirms the ob- servations of Scarpa upon the human subject. Mr Astley Cooper, in his valuable work on Hernia, lias greatly increased our knowledge of the patho- logy of those parts, and illustrated the practice in their injuries ; as has also Mr Lawrence, in his excellent volume upon the same subject. Mr John Bell adds to his Discourse on Wounds of the Belly, a particular illustration of the modes of securing a wounded intestine, and by a plan of the Rahmdorian mode, shows its probable danger ; it may, however, safely be asserted, that this pro- posal, which originated with the German author, and is detailed by Heister, is in most cases abso- lutely impracticable. The great practical point of difference among modem surgeons, in the only operation now ac- knowledged by them, is the mode in which the su- ture should be applied. Mr John Bell insists on the interrupted, Mr Travers recommends the con- tinued. The former takes one, two, or more stitches, the latter holds the wounded extremities of the intestine in contact in their entire circum- ference. Having only practised the mode by a single stitch to the abdominal parietes, and then closing the wound, I can speak of it alone. The eg

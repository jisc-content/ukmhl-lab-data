432 of a size readily to admit the ring finger. Through this perforation there protruded a fatty pedicle or tongue of fully an inch in length, and about two- tenths of an inch in breadth; its anterior surface being convex and somewhat lobulated, while its posterior surface was smooth and flat. This pe- dicle did not adhere to the diaphragm ; but, on opening the pericardium, it was found to arise from the anterior surface of the heart, about an inch and a half from its apex. The heart was of a larger size than it is usually met with ; and its anterior surface, from a little way above the origin of the pedicle to the base, was attached to the pericar- dium by means of long, broad, and strong liga- mentous bands, which were evidently the effect of an attack of acute inflammation at a period anterior to his last illness. His heart is still preserved, and was one of the first that I put up when em- ployed, in 1816, in making anatomical preparations at York Hospital.” I shall conclude this interesting subject, which I might easily enlarge on, by referring to Guattani “ De Aneurismatibus,” for an instance where a pa- tient survived a wound of the aorta for eight years ; and to “ The Medical Records and Researches,” London, 1798, for a case of a penetrating wound, in which a bayonet passed through the colon, stomach, diaphragm, part of the lungs, and the right ventricle of the heart, and the patient sur- vived the accident for upwards of nine hours.

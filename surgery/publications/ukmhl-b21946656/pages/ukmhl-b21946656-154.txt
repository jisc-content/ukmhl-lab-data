1:38 i be precise time of its commencement is not easily ascertained ; I have detected it on the twenty-first day from an injury ; but it is more frequently a disease of the advanced periods. It is most frequent in bones covered by their soft parts, while caries takes place more readily when they are exposed to the air; where the Periosteum is removed for any extent by a gun-shot or lacerated wound, or suffers disor- ganization afterwards from any cause, whether inflammation, ulceration, or erosion ; or where the medulla is injured or destroyed, it becomes a never failing occasion of the death of that part of the bone in the immediate vicinity of the injury. This is not the proper place to enter into the inquiry of the power or influence of the perios- teum to form bone, as a question of pure theory or physiological research. The fact of bone never being regenerated where it is extensively injured, is beyond all doubt. There are few military surgeons accustomed to the examination of limbs removed by ampu- tation from causes affecting the bones, who have not found the diseased or fractured part suffer- ing a loss of its healthy colour, and acquiring a sponginess ; or, as the usual phrase is, an honey- comb appearance on its surface ; but to speak more accurately, exhibiting proofs of the action of the absorbents.

In the eye, particu- larly, I have remarked the pupils contracted in some instances, and in others dilated, where the injury seemed to be nearly of a similar nature and degree ; and I have seen one pupil dilated, and the other much contracted, in the same person. Although we can with much probability say that paralysis or convulsion will take place on the side of the body opposite to the wound, * yet that * Vide an admirable paper on this subject in the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, by Dr Yclloly, Vol. I. p. 183; and some valuable cases by Mr Anderson, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Vol. II. p. 17.

3S9 to be found in the Edin. Med. Essays, Vol. I. And in the Med. Commentaries by Dr Duncan, Vol. IV. p. 434, and Vol. VIII. p. 356, are two very interesting cases. Mursinna, one of Schmuck- er’s successors, in his “ Medic. Chirurg. Beobach- tungen,” relates a case of removal of the thyroid gland by a cannon ball; the patient survived 14 days, and died of dysentery. Richard de Hautescierck gives an interesting case in the “ Re- cueil des Observations,” See. Vol. I. p. 48, where several nervous symptoms followed exposure to cold after a wound of the neck ; and Verdrier, in the 6d vol. of the Memoirs of the Academy, p. 67, gives a very curious case of a wound of the throat, and another of the abdomen, in the same sub- ject. W ounds of the oesophagus, as well as of the stomach and bowels, often remain open for indeter- minate periods. I shall have to give some instances of the latter, when I come to observe upon wounds of the Abdomen. Trioen, in his “ I’asciculus Ob- servationum,” Leyden, 1745, p. 40, gives us an instance of the oesophagus remaining open after a severe gunshot wound, in which also the la- rynx and trachea were implicated. Staff-surgeon Bruce gives a very interesting case of a wound of the oesophagus in the Medico-Chirurgical Journal, Vol. I, p. 369.

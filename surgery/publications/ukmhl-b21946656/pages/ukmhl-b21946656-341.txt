325 The dissection showed much thickening and inflammation of the dura mater ; and an extensive attachment had taken place between that membrane and the cerebellum. The dura mater, all round the neighbourhood of the injury, was covered with a yellowish brown coagulable lymph, and much thickened ; the pia mater did not partake much of the inflammation. About two ounces of water flowed from between the pia and dura mater, and, on cutting into the ventricle, the plexus choroides appeared much diminished in size. The fungus was formed of the inferior and back part of the cere- brum. Two large fissures extended to the foramen magnum. In the thorax, a large collection of mat- ter was found in the sac of the pleura, and a large abscess in the upper part of the lung of the right side. Both the lungs adhered extensively to the pleura costalis ; but the external abscess in the axilla had no connection with the purulent forma- tion in them : it contained much fetid matter, but had no regular cyst. The heart was sound ; so were the abdominal contents, except the liver, whose lower surface presented a blackish marbled appearance. Vast quantities of the bone, and of the brain itself, are often destroyed without immediate, or even eventual, death. I have met with some cases where the upper and lateral parts of the cranium, embracing nearly the whole of the parietal bone of one side, and part of its fellow, with a portion of

In a sergeant of the Enniskillen Dragoons, wounded at Waterloo, a piece of the shaft of a Polish lance stuck fast between the spinous processes of the two last dorsal vertebra;, complete- ly paralyzing him until it was removed. In some cases we have to wait for the slow operation of ex- foliation, if the spinous process be injured. Sinuses also are very apt to form along the spine, and they often prove very troublesome ; I would never trust to pressure in those cases, but make a free, though cautious, incision. These incisions are sometimes rendered very necessary by the lodgment of balls, pieces of cloth, &c. Balls which pass along, or strike against the different bones of which the pelvis is composed, if discharged from a musket, rarely penetrate. Dreadful penetrating wounds and fractures, how- ever, arise from round and grape shot. I have never witnessed a recovery from an injury of this description, nor have I seen one, where the pei- formance of any operation, much less the appli- cation of a trephine, as proposed by Boucher in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1776, could have been of use. The picking away of splinters, or other sources of irritation, is all that I have ventured to do in the few cases that have come under my care, trusting the remainder to proper regimen and dressings, and to the sanative powers of nature. It sometimes happens that balls

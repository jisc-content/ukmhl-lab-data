141 of small blood-vessels to be tied. The limb was carefully dissected by Assistant-Surgeon Ed- wards of the 43d regiment; the soft parts were flabby, oedematous, and in some spots disor- ganized ; and the great vessels either shrunk or obliterated ; but no actual rupture of them could be traced. A large cavity, capable of contain- ing about two pints of fluid, was found deep in the centre of the thigh, involving the course of the slug, and filled with a mixture of gruinous blood and foetid purulent matter. The bone, for the space of about four inches, was found denu- ded of its periosteum, and rough to the touch. On sponging out the parts, the centre of the cavity appeared occupied by the bone, and its sides were partially composed of a sheath of bony granulations, in some spots nearly of a quarter of an inch thick, firmly adhering to the periosteum (which itself adhered to the mass of muscles), and evidently proceeding from it. The detachment of the membrane from the bone appeared to have been produced by a deep- sealed collection of blood, most probably pro- ceeding from sloughing of the. coals of the femoral vessels, and slowly exuding into the track of the wound which formed the original cavity. It is likewise probable that the slug, in its passage, had brushed the bone and killed its enveloping membrane; and that, when the space between the bone and injured membrane

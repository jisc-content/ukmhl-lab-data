is produced, which can be heard at a considerable distance, and, on placing the hand at the root of the neck at these times, the soft parts are felt to be. suddenly distended, and to communicate a feeling of crepitation, which continues at all times to a greater or lesser degree in the neighbourhood of the wound. This noise and the accompanying es- cape of air can be prevented by pressure with the point of the linger in the course of the first rib, a little above and nearer to the spine than the cica- trix of the original wound. He has laboured un- der dyspnoea, with severe cough and expectoration of mucus, streaked with blood. The dyspnoea is much aggravated by the slightest exertion, and he frequently complains of pain in the left side, as if produced by a cord drawn tight from the shoulder to the lowermost rib of that side. The position in which he lies easiest is on his back, with his head and shoulders a little raised. The left side of the chest appears enlarged, and emits, on being struck, a sound distinctly more hollow than the right. His pectoral symptoms are always aggravated in damp foggy weather. His flesh since his admis- sion has wasted, his strength has decayed, and he has been in a state approaching to hectic fever. Op iates have been administered, and occasional blisters applied with temporary relief. An incision into the swelling has also been made at the root of the neck, but only a small quantity of air was dis- charged, and little relief obtained.

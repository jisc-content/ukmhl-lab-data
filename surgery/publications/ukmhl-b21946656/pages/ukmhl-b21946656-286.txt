The military surgeon anticipates all the consequences of delayed operation, not only from the particular effects it may have upon individuals, but the great influence which protracted suppurations, hemorrhages, diar- rhoeas, febrile exacerbations, and hectic sweatings, must have upon those who live within an atmo- sphere constantly impregnated with the effluvia arising from patients suffering under them. To lessen an evil which we cannot altogether avoid, we must lose no time in effectually preventing that deterioration of the hospital atmosphere, which these diseased processes so materially con- tribute to. On the very day that a subsidence of fever is effectually announced by a free and healthy suppuration ; by the abatement of local inflamma- tion ; by a restoration of the skin to its functions, demonstrated by returning coolness and elasticity, particularly on the affected limb, we should pro- ceed to perform our amputation on those patients * in whom no hope of an ultimate recovery without it, can be entertained. We thus do them the strictest justice, and we hold out to the cases re- served for trial the greatest possible chance of re- covery. To prepare them for this state, much may be done by attention to their bowels ; costiveness is a source of great irritation, and not an unfre- quent cause of the commencement of the diar- rhoeas which so often hurry off those poor sufferers. Dryness of the skin, and febrile heat, often de-

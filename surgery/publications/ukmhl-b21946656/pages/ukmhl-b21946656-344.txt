m 8 occurrence (which is uncertain in its period of at- tack) will frequently take place either in the upper or the lower extremity, or in the entire of the op- posite side, and be either partial or general, from causes which are altogether beyond our research. The opinion, that paralysis took place on one side, (that corresponding to the injury,) and convulsion on the opposite, I have never seen verified by ex- perience. I have seen some cases of general ner- vous affection of both sides after violent injury, where one has been more affected than the other; and in those general affections, I have observed that convulsions have been a more frequent occurrence than paralysis, when the fore and side parts of the head have been wounded. Paralysis has occurred proportionally oftener in my practice, where the wound or injury approached nearer to the cerebel- lum. I have, however, seen paralysis of one side and convulsion of another, take place when the blow has been upon the forehead, and the same when it has been on the occiput. Before entirely dismissing this subject, I would offer one caution to the ju- nior surgeons, suggested not by what may happen, but by what I have known actually to occur, viz. not to forget the effects of a blow on the head, and attribute the inability of motion in the limbs to other causes. I shall give the heads of an instruc- 5. la cases of external accident, the prognosis is most favour- able where one side only is affected.

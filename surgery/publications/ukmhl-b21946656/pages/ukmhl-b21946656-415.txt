The practice is not novel. John de Vigo, in the tenth chapter of his third book, has given an account of it; and Pare says that the practice is founded on reason and truth, if there is little or no blood pour- ed forth into the cavity of the chest; he, however, does not close the wound for the first two or three days, to prevent the accumulation of blood.

His history of the secret dressing, which consisted in sucking out the blood, and then closing the wound, is highly worthy of notice, and is given with great fidelity in his “ Traite Com- plet de Chirurgie,” Vol. III. p. 20, Paris edition of 1732.

3Â«3 dreds, I was unable to see him before the 21st *, his case, however, was reported to me daily. Much coagulated blood, and some particles of sand on which lie had fallen, together with a thin scale of lead, obviously a bit of a split musket ball, had been removed. His pulse had risen on the night of his arrival to about 100, hard and bounding, and he had been copiously bled in consequence. A cruciform enlargement of the wound had been made, which bled copiously, and gave a view of an extensive fracture of the left parietal bone. On my visit I found him nearly as follows: Counte- nance pale, expressive of great pain, referable more to mental than corporeal suffering; mouth still distorted; eye sunk, but its pupil dilatable; the power of articulating any distinct sound lost, but the desire obviously strong ; pulse 80, soft; tongue clean ; bowels open, (by saline purgatives;) urine copious, and with a rose-coloured sediment; skin moderately warm, and at the region of the liver bathed in sweat; the liver itself obviously project- ing, and giving a painful sensation when pressed upon, evinced by his wincing from the touch. On examining the wound of the head, I found an exten- sive radiated fracture, occupying almost the whole of the left parietal bone; at the centre there was a piece of bone, apparently the size of a musket ball, beat in through the membranes of the brain, and bedded in its substance, but considerably more toward the frontal region than the occipital.

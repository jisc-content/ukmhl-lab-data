428 It may be observed generally of the organs contained in the different cavities, that, after any serious wound, their disposition to disease is very much increased, and causes which, in a state of health, would have had scarcely any effect upon them, operate very powerfully. In the head, the tendency to congestion becomes so great, that phre- nitis and mania follow any excitement from heat, exertion, violent emotions, and especially excesses in drinking. In the abdomen, hernia, local pains darting around the affected part, irregularity of the bowels and the stomach, borborygmi, gastrodynia, &c. &c. follow its injuries. But the lungs suffer most particularly severely in the thoracic lesions, the slightest atmospheric changes affecting them power- fully. This consequence is almost invariable ; yet there have been remarked instances where a natural- ly delicate, or even an actually diseased state of the lungs, has been bettered by a penetrating wound. An instance of this kind has never come under my notice ; although I have very respectable living au- thority to say, that a strong predisposition to phthi- sis was suspended in one case, and spasmodic asth- ma remarkably relieved in another, by penetrating wounds of the thorax. M. Larrey mentions the case of an officer cured of a well characterized phthi- sis by a wound which penetrated this cavity. * * fade Memoires, Vol. III. p. 376. M. Larrey says, that it occurred to the officer who is represented standing and sup- ported under the arms, in the well known picture of the death ot Wolfe.

306 surgery arc equally applicable as in the accidents of civil life. The difficulties, however, of elevating or extracting the depressed portions of bone beat in upon the brain by gunshot, or the extraneous matter carried into its substance, are much greater o comparatively; the ball, from the projectile force communicated to it, not only fracturing the bone, but hurrying in with it the detached piece or pieces, and jamming them under or amongst the sound parts ; frequently, also, it lodges among the fractur- ed portions ; frequently it imbeds itself between the more solid osseous plates, and forms a kind of ni- dus in the diplbe ; and sometimes it drives for- ward into the brain itself, eluding the search of the surgeon, and subverting the theories of the physiologist. In the majority of cases, a leaden ball is either flattened against the bone, or, if it has struck obliquely* it is cut against the unshat- tered edge of the cranium ; and is either simply jagged, or is divided into two or more distinct parts, forming with each other various angles, in- fluenced in their acuteness by the projectile force, the distance, obliquity, &c. See. It not unfrequently happens, that a perfect divi- sion of the ball takes place ; and the two distinct masses lodge, or one lodges and the other flies off totally; or else it takes its course through a different set of parts, or imbeds itself in a different spot from that where it originally struck. In all those cases, the removal of extraneous matters, the extraction

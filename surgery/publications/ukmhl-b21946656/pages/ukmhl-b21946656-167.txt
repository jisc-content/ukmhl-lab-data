151 liirib has been in an oblique position, or that thfe ball has taken an oblique course, these fragments are often driven in to a great distance, and firmly impacted in its cavity, there keeping up a constant and uncontrollable irritation, and destroying both the medulla and its membrane, together with the cancelli, which naturally support it. I have re- peatedly seen this separated portion of bone, lying â€¢ in the medullary canal, at the distance of from four lines to an inch and half from the circular hole formed by the passage of the ball, retaining its shape and its solidity, while all the surrounding osseous parts were diseased, and formed a spongy discoloured mass of bony granulations around it; the periosteum for some way, both above and be- low the wound, being entirely separated from the bone. To attempt to save such a limb, is imposing a task on the powers of nature, which nineteen times in twenty she is unable to effect, even under the most favourable circumstances. If a ball has pass- ed through without carrying in any fragments of bone, a case which sometimes happens in the thigh, when the man is standing erect, and the ball has struck the bone fairly and directly, the case is more favourable than when the wound is oblique, as in the arm, which is so often thrown into a variety of postures; and, consequently, where there is a greater chance that the channel of the ball should be formed obliquely, and the spi- cular fragments forced up into the medullary cavity.

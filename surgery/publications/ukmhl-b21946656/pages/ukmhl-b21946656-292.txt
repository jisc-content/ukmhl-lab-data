270 mand the flow of blood, I would advise, that what- ever confidence we may have in our assistants, or those around us, the application of this instrument should never be entrusted to any individual ; nor should we proceed to operate until we have person- ally ascertained our perfect command of the circu- lation. Secondly, where the circulation is to be commanded by the pressure from the hand of an assistant, particularly in the operation at the shoul- der-joint, there is not only no necessity for the ap- plication of the key, boot-hook, or tourniquet handle, usually employed previous to beginning the operation; but it is actually hurtful. The long-continued pressure is excruciating to the pa- tient, and is often more the subject of his com- plaint than any other step of the business; it is also particularly fatiguing to the assistant, who, by this means, begins to flag at the moment his strength and dexterity are most wanting. Pott well knew the advantages of husbanding the strength of his assistants, (indeed what of practical utility did he not know ?) and thought it not un- worthy to remark upon their tired state ;* but in the operation I am speaking of, the assistant has by far the most serious part of it to manage ; and if his management is proper, a more bloodless one, for its magnitude, is not in surgery. I abstain from all comment upon the opinion of Mr John * Keraarks on Fractures and Dislocations.

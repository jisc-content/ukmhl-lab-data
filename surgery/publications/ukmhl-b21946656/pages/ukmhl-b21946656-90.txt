74 where a vessel has been tied, if long ligatures are left, they must be verv cautiously handled ; if ad he sive straps have been used, they must be taken off one by one. Gentle pressure must be made all round to bring away any concealed mat- ter ; and if abscesses have formed, they should be opened on the spot. The fresh dressings must now be applied without any unnecessarydelay,all their loose edges and redundancies removed, and a neatness and even nicety of shape observed in the straps and dossils, which, though we our- selves know not to be essential, weigh amaz- ingly with the patients and attendants. In the application of the roller, however, nicety is essen- tial, as on its due employment the removal of existing evils and the prevention of many more entirely depend. As a support to parts requir- ing approximation or separation ; as preventing the insinuation of matter, blood, or serum, among the intersticial spaces ; as expelling them and preventing their re-accumulation when formed ; as repressing redundant or protruding growths, or stimulating to their absorption ; and, finally, as retaining other applications in contact to the partsâ€”too much attention can scarcely be paid to the application of the roller : and yet candour compels me to say, that foreigners of almost all countries excel us in this fundamental part of our art. Our young surgeons may study, phi- losophize, and reason well; but neither books.

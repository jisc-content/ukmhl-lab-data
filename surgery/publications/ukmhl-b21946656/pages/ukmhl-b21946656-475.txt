with blood ; and in less than an hour another dis- charge, having less colour of blood than the for- mer. On the arrival of the surgeon the chamber- pot was examined, when a lump, in the shape oj a short thick shrimp, was taken out, which was that night thought a stone, being covered with black grit, and very hard. One side was lighter in colour than the other, where I suppose it was fastened to. It was placed in a glass, and in the morning all the surgeons examined it, by which time it be- came dry, and, on being pressed, it clearly appear- ed to be cloth, which had been driven in by the force of the ball. I do believe, that the great pain that I felt in the side, and, as it made its ap- proaches, was solely occasioned by its movements ; and also, that it remained some time near the bot- tom of the testicles and penis. I do not hesitate to say, that it has injured the parts of the passage, from symptoms I now feel.‚Äù This officer is now in good health. He keeps the cloth as a relic. It is three quarters of an inch long, and tapering to a point like a piece of the end of a bougie. Two projecting shreds, like antennae, now gone, but which originally belonged to it, gave it the appearance of the shrimp which he describes. The passage of the cloth from the wound in the breast, across the body, through the ureter in- to the bladder, and thence by the urethra, can ad- mit of no question j the dilatability of the ureter.

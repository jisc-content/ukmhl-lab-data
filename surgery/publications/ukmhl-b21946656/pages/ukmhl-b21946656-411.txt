To discover whe- ther the wound has injured the lungs or not, is a point which has given to the older surgeons great room for the employment of their inge- nuity in devising possible cases, and has occa- sioned no small waste of time and wax-tapers in ascertaining the exit of air through the passage. A practical surgeon will require but little investi- gation ; bloody expectoration immediately on re- ceiving the wound, and the terrible symptoms of dyspnoea, sense of stricture and suffocation, insup- portable anxiety, and faintness, which succeed, soon enough discover the fact; and if by good fortune no intimation is given in this way, happy is the surgeon, and thrice fortunate the patient.

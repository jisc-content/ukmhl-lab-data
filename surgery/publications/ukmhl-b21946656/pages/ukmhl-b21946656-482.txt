about the size of a grain of coarse gunpowder, had passed at different times. The urine drawn off from the bladder was in general turbid, and on being allowed to deposit its sediment, about three drachms of osseous grit had been collected from it at differ- ent periods. After some time he began to pass the urine partially by the natural passage, and the same osseous grit was deposited, while a discharge of more palpable bony particles appeared in the stream ; these w'ere collected from time to time, and amounted to three drachms in weight; the largest piece was circular, flat like a piece of coin, and of the size of a split pea. The man was trans- ferred from my care and sent home to England. I saw him eight months after; his general health was good, but the osseous discharge still continu- ed. He presented me with some fewr pieces of the bone, rough and angular, about one-third of an inch in length, and one-fourth broad, which had all passed by the urethra, and weighed to- gether about an additional drachm ; and also one piece which had passed by the wound, of about the same size as the others, but smooth on one surface, evidently an exfoliation direct from the pubes, without having been acted on by the urine. Air is sometimes, but very rarely, passed from the bladder, most probably from some opening in the ureter communicating with an external wound ; or, as in the cases mentioned by * Camper, from * Dcmonslrat.

This man lived from tne 18th June, the day of his wound, until the 1st of November, when he died hectic. He had had a discharge of about a pint of purulent matter daily from the external wound, but it suddenly ceased, and the stools became very frequent, with a large commixture of pus, some time before his death. The thoracic cavity exhibited only a slight ulcera- tion on the surface of the lungs, at the entrance of the ball, and a small sac, containing a very little matter, similar to what w7as mixed with his stools during life. I have never had an opportunity of examining the lungs after recovery from a severe wound. Where death has occurred after recent slight o wounds, thickenings, adhesions, and the other usual consequences of inflammation, are observed ; but Sir Everard Home has given us the appear- ances on dissection, after a lapse of 32 years.; in a paper in the 2d Yol. of the Transactions of a Socie- ty for the Improvement of Medical and Chirurgical Knowledge, p. 169, which is highly interesting. An induration of the substance of the lungs was form- ed wherever the ball had passed, its entrance was readily discovered by a cicatrix, the membrane at that part being thinner than usual, and having a

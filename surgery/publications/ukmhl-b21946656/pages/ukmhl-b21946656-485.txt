It has been said that balls have been passed by the urethra, * but no prudent surgeon would trust to such an event. An ingenious idea of dissolving the ball by means of crude quicksilver, was started in France ; Le Dran instituted some experiments on the subject, he effected the amalgamation of lead in a vessel filled with urine, and brought to the heat of the body ; he went a step farther, and, thrusting some lead into the bladder of an ass, conceived that it * Pauiinus, Cent. 3.

299 were reported to me by Hospital-Assistant Nichol. In the thorax, extensive adhesions were observed between the pleura costalis and pulmonalis. The right lung seemed perfectly sound ; but on the pos- terior part of the left lobe, several tubercles were observable in a state of suppuration, and a greater than usual quantity of fluid was found within the pericardium. The abdominal viscera all appeared sound. On making an incision over the hip-joint of the right side, a considerable collection of mat- ter was discovered around the trochanter major, chiefly external to the capsular ligament. The trochanter at one point was denuded of its perios- teum. The synovia of the joint was changed in appearance, having a dark yellowish tinge. These diseased appearances had no communication what- ever with the stump. Nature sometimes effects a cure by the dis- charge of this matter, collected in or near the joints, but it frequently remains unnoticed, until death, although, in some cases, an obscure dif- fused kind of swelling gives room to suspect its formation, and suggests the propriety of topical blistering and venesection. The following case, furnished me by Assistant Staff-surgeon Blackadder, is very illustrative of some of the circumstances attending field amputa- tion, and the combination of causes tending to pro- duce the fatal event.

44G was in the act of kneeling on the right knee, in the front rank of his corps, preparatory to their receiving a column of French cavalry, which was advancing in front of them. He was brought in- to hospital, and had his wounds dressed on the third day after the action. During the first six days after his admission into hospital, his stools were passed involuntarily through the anterior ori- fice of the wound in the thigh, but no part of them was ever passed by the posterior orifice in the ilium. From tin's day, (27th June,) they were passed partly by the anterior orifice of the wound, and partly naturally, at the intervals when he was usually called to stool, until the 20th July, when the whole of the fecal discharge took the ordinary course. The posterior orifice had now cicatrized, and the anterior, gradually assuming a more healthy appearance, was ultimately cicatrized on the 20th August following. The only medicine admini- stered to the patient during the whole of the cure was an occasional laxative, according as the state of his bowels required it, in order to render his stools more liquid, and to facilitate their egress through the wound. His general health continu- ed invariably good; and, at the period of his dis- charge from hospital, he was nearly equal to the performance of his military duty. * Injuries of the abdominal parietes from shot * Communicated by Mr Reid, Assistant-surgeon, 25th Re. giinent.

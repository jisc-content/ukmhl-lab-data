28G pain, and of increased facility to the operator in forming a smooth even-edged line. In amputating, I have, in a great measure, followed Alansonâ€™s plan, and have given an oblique direction to all the incisions through the muscles, (the first having fairly divided the integuments and fascia,) as much upwards and inwards as possible. This saves a vast deal of dissection of teguments from the muscles, and is a powerful guard against leaving an overhanging and useless pouch of skin. If the incisions are made perpendicularly down to- wards the bone, a long dissection of skin is neces- sary ; this is recommended and depicted in some of the modern systems of surgery, to an extent which I conceive entirely unnecessary under any circumstances, and which I know to be highly improper in most. In a small limb, I have re- peatedly performed the operation with one sweep of the knife, cutting obliquely inwards and up- wards, at once to the bone. The only objection that strikes me to operating in this mode is, that the arteries are sliced obliquely like a writing pen instead of being cut fairly across, and that if this is not kept in remembrance, secondary hemorrhage may take place after the vigour of circulation is restored, in consequence of the whole circumfer- ence of the vessel not being included in the liga- ture. By drawing the vessel fairly out, and plac- ing the ligature beyond the commencement of the oblique cut, this accident will be effectually pre-

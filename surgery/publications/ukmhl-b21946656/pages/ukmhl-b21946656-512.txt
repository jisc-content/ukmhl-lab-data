+96 broth for the dinner of each patient, for which the barley is allowed. When it shall be found necessary to put any patient upon a milk diet, it is to be done by giving a pint of milk morning and evening for breakfast and supper, in place of tea, the spoon or fever diet, and one pint for dinner ; and it will be expected, that medical officers be careful not to order any milk under the other heads of diet, or promis- cuously, in case of disease, as in many it is not only unnecessary, but rather prejudicial; while, in several of the sequels of pneumonia, and of syphilis, and in phthisis pulmonalis, as well as in hectic fever accompanying other chronic diseases, milk may be exhibited in the way above mentioned. If, on any other occasion, a medical officer shall think it expedient to order extra milk, a detail of the necessity will be expected, as it will also be when other extra articles are given; the pre- sent table of diet allowing amply for almost all cases of disease and convalescence. During the period of convalescence, it is recommended to me- dical officers, to put the patients gradually upon such diets as approach nearest to their ordinary food in health, for much injury often arises, as has but too frequently been observed, from their pass- ing at once from low, or even spoon diet, with either one, or perhaps numerous extras, to the usual food of a healthy man.

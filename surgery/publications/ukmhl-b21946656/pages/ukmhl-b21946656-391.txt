375 111 injuries of the lower jaw-bone, it the iiaer ture is not complete, little more need 01 can be done, than removing the splinters ancl loose teeth, and taking away exfoliations, to which it is pai- ticularly liable. If the bone is fairly divided into two portions, the best chance of avoiding great deformity, is to apply the lower jaw closely in con- tact with the upper, which, in this case, must be viewed in the light of a fixed splint, supporting the part by a properly adapted roller, with a com- press over the fractured points, and giving the patient the strictest injunctions to keep his mouth closed. His food must be altogether fluid, and his wants and wishes conveyed on paper. Frag- ments of bone and teeth are sometimes driven far into the sound parts; and if the fauces or tonsils are engaged, great irritation follows. A very curious case of this kind is now before me, which I hope my friend, Staff-surgeon Mâ€˜Leod of the York Hospital, will give more at large. An of- ficer had the lower jaw fractured, and several teeth knocked out, at the storm of St Sebastian. After a variety of sufferings, he is now in perfect health, and serving in the army ; but in the posterior part of his fauces there is lodged a substance, whether a fragment of jaw-bone, or a tooth, cannot be now determined, around which an extensive osseous luable observations on the subject I would particularly re- commend the study of Burns on the Surgical Anatomy of the Head and Keck, Edinburgh, 1811.

This is more particularly the case where a spent ball of large size grazes along any of the cavities; or where they have received a severe injury from the running over of a gun, or the explosion of an ammunition waggon, or other violence; on all these occasions, great advantage will be de- rived from taking a few ounces of blood from the arm, and embrocating the contused part with some linimentum saponis or any other-mild sti- mulant. If the vitality of the part is not en- tirely destroyed, it will soon be relieved ; but where that is the case, a circumscribed tumour, soft and pulpy to the feel, forms on the spot; the skin, at first of a natural colour, gradually assumes a dusky shining hue, and either sloughs off, leaving beneath a dark glossy flabby muscu- lar mass, discharging tenacious bloody sanies ; or else a chain of ill-conditioned abscesses forms, which soon run into one another, and burrow deep beneath the disorganized mass of skin and muscle, if not prevented by timely evacuation.

164 diet this day was entirely confined to lemonade. Tuesday 20th.—Mr Hennen did not come till towards evening, and then placed me on his own private list of patients. Before his arrival, the as- sistant-surgeon of my own corps brought a staff- surgeon to remove the limb ; but the latter gentle- man, after carefully examining it, said he did not feel justified in amputating it without a consultation. Mr H. ordered me immediately to lose sixteen ounces of blood from the arm, to apply twenty-four leeches to the knee, and to purge copiously with Epsom salts, keeping the part covered with cloths dipped in cold water, and preventing inflammation by all possible means. His directions were com- plied with, and I felt relieved, but much debili- tated ; diet, water and lemonade. Wednesday 2\st.—The assistant surgeon called in the morning, and applied fifteen leeches ; Mr Hennen called in the evening, and ordered thirty to be applied in- stantly by a native surgeon, which was done ef- fectually, and reiterated his direction to live low, and keep down inflammation by all possible means. I now felt very languid, and, in addition to my water and lemonade, took one basin of gruel and one small roll (weight two ounces) of very fine white flour. Thursday, 22d June.—Bled again with thirty leeches in the morning, and thirty in the evening ; some of the orifices continuing to dis- charge from one bleeding to the other. Diet as yesterday, with tea to my roll. Friday

It served, however, one useful purpose; for, on withdrawing it from the wound, the ball was brought along with it, bedded in its folds. Where a ball has entered any of the cavities, its course is often rendered Very obscure. The discharge, if any, of the peculiar fluids, as air, urine, feeces, &c. will very clearly detect it, if the organs containing them are wounded: but I have observed and demonstrated several cases in which the ball has fairly penetrated the pa* rietes of the thorax; but more frequently the abdomen ; and yet the organs contained under the point of its entrance, or even at that of its exit, have not been injured.

281 I have sometimes found them full, as if they had been stuffed by art with coarsely pounded bone,) and bring them as nearly together as we can. Wherever the scapula and clavicle are involved, which generally implies an extensive destruction of the soft parts, after removing all splinters, the wound must be lightly dressed, and its future covering left to adhesive straps and bandage, which, if judiciously employed, will very soon ef- fect this purpose without the use of ligatures or sutures. I have never met with a case where the removal of any part of the scapula by the saw, or even the paring of the cartilage of the glenoid ca- vity, was at all necessary, if extensive fracture of it did not exist. If the head of the bone is the only part injur- ed, or if the injury does not spread to any extent along the shaft, it certainly becomes the duty of the surgeon to attempt to save the limb. The following inquiries and considerations, however, appear to me well worthy of being seriously weigh- ed before we proceed to remove the head of the hone. 1. That the splintering of the shaft of the bone may not be so extensive as to reach much beyond the point where a removal of its head could be useful; and here it is to be remarked, that experience almost universally shows that splin- tering, or splitting of the bone, extends downwards towards the condyles instead of towards the head, and the same holds good in the femur, and in the tibia. 2. That the head of the bone being

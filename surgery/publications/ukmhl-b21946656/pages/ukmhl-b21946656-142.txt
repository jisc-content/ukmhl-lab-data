126 In the inflammatory stage, which lasts from five to fifteen days in general, I am in the habit of leaving the limb in the exact position des- cribed by Pott; but with the bandage of de- tached pieces of roller, commonly called after Scultetus, reaching for six or eight inches above and below the fracture, instead of the eighteen- tailed one, as possessing several advantages from its simplicity, and the ease with which it is ap- plied, and with which its different parts may be removed, by simply pinning to any of the soiled pieces a fresh slip of roller, and drawing it under the limb into the proper situation, by the same movement which displaces the rejected parts. Over this 1 place two splints of whalebone, such as are usually supplied to the army, moderately tight, and in such a way as to admit of dressing the orifice, or orifices if the ball has passed through the limb, without removing them. The irregularities of the limb are stuffed with tow, or rags, or bags of chaff, and the whole is kept moist with cold saturnine solution of moderate strength, and with the addition of some cam- phorated spirit. When the inflammatory symp- toms are subdued, I then proceed more accu- rately to adjust the fractured bone ; and, to this end, place the patient on his back, a change of posture which invariably gives relief, filling up all hollows, and arranging the limb precisely after the mode recommended by Professor

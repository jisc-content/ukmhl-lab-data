Pouteau thought, that, instead of a greater determination to the head, there was an obstruction there, and a congestion in the liver. Desault attributes it entirely to sympathy. Rich- erand accounts for it mechanically, and adduces proofs drawn from the effects of precipitating dead bodies into a deep pit meant for their reception at the hospital of St Louis, in which the liver has been torn to a considerable extent; but I conceive that the circumstance of the liver being affected by a blow on the head, where the patient has not fallen, militates much against this explanation, and that we are still at a loss to trace the cause. The connection we know exists, but we are ignorant of the extent. It exists, though not uniformly, both in slight injuries of the scalp and severe fractures, and shows itself from the bilious erysipelatous tinge produced by a scratch on the teguments, to a deep-seated abscess. Of this, however, we are assured, that it is in the primae via? alone we can encounter those symptoms in their various shapes and degrees.

156 on the ridges of bones, sticking out from them in the form of spiculce, and giving the bone a serrated appearance ; in others, the surface of the bone is covered with new formed osseous matter, divided into numerous sulci parallel to each other, and with processes of the periosteum dipping in between them, in a manner very nearly resembling the sur- face of the stones of some fruits ; but in the ordi- nary process of the formation of a new bony sheath from necrosis, the surface is more uniform, with ir- regular minute holes into which these processes sink. In the recent bone, these irregularities are all concealed by the investing thickened perios- teum, which, by its affording an uniformity of co- vering, often gives rise to a deception, in some cases so complete, as to lead to the supposition, that the heads of the bones paiticipated in the re- novation of their shafts. This is never the case j the process of renovation in necrosis goes on only in those parts of bones corresponding with their medullary cavities, and the apparent renovation is shown to be illusive on the removal of the perios- teum by careful maceration. If the removal is attempted by the unassisted knife, the effect is very incomplete, the membrane is glistening in appearance, and in consistence somewhat like car- tilage, and only loosens by long maceration, when it peels off in a tough leathery coat, connected to the subjacent bone by vascular threads; and on its removal, a smooth narrow ivory-like line is

On the 31st, the blood sprung from the artery in a full jet, when the actual cautery and pressure restrained it. On the 12th of January, the hemorrhage again returned, and was controlled by pressure. It continued to recur so often from this period, that the life of the patient was in im- minent danger, until, on the 22d, a dreadful dis- charge of blood threatened at once to terminate his existence.

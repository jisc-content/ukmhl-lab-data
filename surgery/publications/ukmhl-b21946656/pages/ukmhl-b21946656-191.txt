175 per, previously brought through one or more pulleys, and, with a hook attached to the end of it, is fasten- ed to the loop in the toe of the shoe; at its other end is the scale or vessel for holding the weight. Now, it is evident, that, on putting a weight into the vessel at one end of the cord, the other must be acted upon ; and if the weights are properly gra- duated, force to any degree, from the most gentle, can be made use of. > In the same way, the arm being secured in the hinged jugum by straps to a proper table, the cord hooked in the jugum, and first passed through a pulley in the floor, and then through one in the ceiling, as in the other case, will have the effect of gradually stretching it. The advantage gained by each trial can be mea- sured by a common ruler. Simple or medicat- ed frictions, or the affusion of cold or tepid water, may be employed during the time of using the pulley, and the limb may be subjected to it as often during the day as may be thought necessary. Morning and evening are the usual periods at llil- sea, and hitherto there have been no states of con- traction, except those depending on anchylosis, which have not derived benefit from it. By a judicious application of bandages, and a strict attention to posture, in the early stages of wounds, these accidents may in most cases be pre- vented ; and in all, their future ill effects consi- derably lessened ; but it is a matter of serious im- portance that a surgeon, unacquainted with military

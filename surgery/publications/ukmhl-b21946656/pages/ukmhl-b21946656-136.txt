120 In mentioning the removal of those cases from the field, I recommended that, after the bones were placed in as close apposition as the nature of the case could admit, and properly secured, the limb should be laid in a relaxed position ; this relaxation preparatory to a move, or pending the violent inflammatory re-action which is certain to come on in a few hours after the receipt of the injury, is by no means intended to be continued through the whole period of the cure ; indeed it has become a ques- tion with some able surgeons, whether, if the compound fractures could be set at the moment of infliction, and the proper apparatus for continued extension was at hand, it would not be adviseable at once to put them in posi- tion. In many situations this is utterly imprac- ticable, from the nature of the service, from the violent spasmodic action of the muscles of the limb, and sometimes, though more rarely, from the obstinacy of the patients themselves.

Chance, which has such frequent and powerful influence over us, perhaps originally suggested what Experience has fully proved to be founded in truth ; and in no situation can those fortuitous

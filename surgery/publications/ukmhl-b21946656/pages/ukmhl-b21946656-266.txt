On one occasion, I have seen chronic gangrene prevalent in a military hospital, but it was at its termination, and when it had ceased to be infec- tious. Twelve subjects were handed over to me by the late Staff-surgeon Bell, at Abrantes, in September 1812, reported to have had the dis- ease very violently, and it was said to have carried off* vast numbers previously. The hospital was situated upon the southern, or Alemtejo bank of the Tagus, in a low, flat, moist, olive-ground, oc- casionally overflowed by the river. In its neigh- bourhood was the great commissariat depot, where vast quantities of cattle were daily slaughtered, and where, from the number of carts, oxen, and mules hourly traversing the adjacent fields, the soil, intermixed with their food and ordure, and occasionally with damaged biscuit, was trodden down into a thick, tenacious, offensive compost, on which a burning sun acted almost constantly. On the northern bank, the hill on which the town of Abrantes was built, rose to a considerable height, and intercepted the currents of the winds, forming, by following the natural bend of the ri- ver, nearly a quarter circle round the hospital grounds. This stagnation of air was most obvious in the morning, when the inhabitants of Ros9io (as the little village was called) were enveloped in palpable fog, which was seen rolling languidly H urm*, Crofton, Fenton, and Dethick, were unremitting in their attentions.

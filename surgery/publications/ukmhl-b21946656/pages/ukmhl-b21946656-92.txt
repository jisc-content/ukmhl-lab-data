The soldier, who is so fierce in the field and so submissive in the operation room, becomes a most fretful being under the smarting of his wounds; and he frequently looks upon our best directed endeavours for his relief, as only experi- ments upon his fortitude. I am sorry to say, that J have but too often seen surgeons, even of high rank and long experience, yielding to a prurience for operation, take up the knife, the forceps, and the probe on every opportunity; and handle in the most inconsiderate manner even the fractured limbs of their patients. * Lectures on Inflammation, by John Thomson, MJD. Edinb. 1813, p. 294. Vide also a very well-meant and well- timed Letter, by Dr. Dewar, upon a particular State of Gun- shot Wounds, addressed to Staff-Surgeon Boggie, Edinb. 1815. A paper on the subject is also to be foimd in the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, voL vii. p. 482, part ii. by the same author. t

404 as t0 mj’ as ifc originally did, the side of the thorax *° ft belongs. Whenever the orifice in the tegument is open, the air has a free passage through 1 , and continues to be forced out at every attempt at expii ation, until the process of adhesion has ta- ken place, if not prevented by art. If the lung lies cojlapsed at the bottom of the thoracic cavity, and that the external wound is healed up before it has 1 esumed its natural inflated state, any small portion of air that may remain within is soon de- composed or absorbed. In many cases, however, where adhesion exists, or has subsequently taken place between the wounded lung and the thoracic pleura, air in small quantities continues to be dis- charged through the external orifice, until it is perfectly healed, (whenever the dressings are re- moved,) without any serious inconvenience to the patient. The sinking of the lung is not an uniform consequence of a penetrating wound of the tho- rax. We have sometimes ocular proof of this, not only by the close contact in which the lungs lie to the wound, discoverable at first sight, but by protrusions which occasionally happen, and which, in the hands of the older surgeons, were remov- ed by the knife,—a practice now rejected, and gentle pressure substituted. These facts are still further illustrated and confirmed by the observa- tions of Mr Abernethy on the subject, * and the * Works. Vof. If. On Emphysema.

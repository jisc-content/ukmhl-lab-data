I have occasionally met with herniary protrusions of the lungs from these causes, which have been attended with no par- ticular inconvenience, but have suppurated freely, and have been punctured like cases of common abscess. But, in general, all injuries of the thorax lay the foundation of a strong disposition to disease, particularly influenced by the state of the atmo- sphere, and coming very close in their nature to pulmonary consumption.

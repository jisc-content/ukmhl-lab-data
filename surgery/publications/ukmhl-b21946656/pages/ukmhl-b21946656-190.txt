flam matron, or from improper posture, generally the bent one ; or a combination of all those causes may exist. lo remedy these contractions, a variety of me- chanical contrivances have been had recourse to ; but I am persuaded, that the more simple the plan, the more likely it is to succeed. That in use in Hilsea Hospital is, perhaps, the most simple of any, and can be easily, and without expence, erected in every hospital. It consists of a firm wooden chair, with a strong jugum of wood, of the shape of the letter U, for confining the thigh, if the contrac- tion is in the knee-joint; or a piece of wood with a hinge, like the letter V, if the elbow be the joint affected ; some small brass pulleys made for screwing in the floor, wall, or ceiling, with a pro- per cord ; a shoe with three loops of iron, one at the toe, and one at each side, halfway between the toe and heel, and a tin or other vessel for contain- ing some weights.

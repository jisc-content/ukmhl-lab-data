123 straight line, splintering both ends of the bone extensively. Four days elapsed before he was brought to Brussels and safely deposited in my house, during which period no dressing had been applied ; in fact, the clothes in which he had been wounded remained on him to the eighth day, contrary to every persuasive argu- ment that could be used with him. When he did submit to have the limb placed in a proper position, it was effected in so short a space of time, and with so little pain and inconvenience, that he would not believe that I had even com- menced the attempt. These few instances, selected from a vast number, sufficiently shew, that immediate ex- tension, coaptation, &c. are not applicable in all cases ; neither are they absolutely necessary to the present comfort or future safety of the patient. To which also I may add, that, having been principally employed in the Peninsular war, and in the campaign of the Netherlands, in the fixed hospitals, I have consequently had ample opportunities of viewing the state in which the fractures arrived from thefield. And, although in many, the hands of a master were easily recognized in the mode of dressing, in none did I ever see the limb in such a slate as to preclude the necessity of going over all the steps of re- setting, and consequently of redoubling the pa- tientâ€™s anguish.

Appearances on dissection, July 30th.—The abdomen having been opened by a crucial in- cision, the first remarkable circumstance which presented itself was an immense quantity of effused liquid, mixed with faeces; and it was soon discovered that a rupture of about an inch and a half in extent had been made in that part of the inteslinum ileum which crossed the cavity of the abdomen anteriorly, about two inches below the umbilicus, and immediately opposite the part which bore the mark of the horse’s foot. The whole of the intestines were exceed- ingly vascular, from the violent inflammation which had taken place; but this was more par- ticularly remarkable in the convolutions of the ileum, which was wounded by the blow. A considerable quantity of coagulable lymph had been effused by the vessels communicating with the wound : a small quantity of pus was also visible ; the w hole of the omentum was uncommonly red, with great turgescence of its vessels ; the bladder w as found perfectly sound, empty, and collapsed ; the stomach and liver were perfectly free from disease ; the gall-blad- der was distended with bile.

The occasional favourable but deceptive ap- pearances of the wound, together with the patientâ€™s youth, constitution, and entreaties to defer the ope- ration, were the chief causes of procrastination. The discharge would, at times, become greatly di- minished ; the healing process would, for a while, seem to go on rapidly, with the absence of pain, and subsidence of inflammation, when, all at once, these last would again recur, with the formation of deep-seated abscesses, bursting out of matter, and high symptomatic fever. Such harassing alterna- tions induced him at length to coincide in the im- propriety of further delay towards the removal of the limb. It was, accordingly, performed on the 7th September 1812, nearly two years subsequent to the infliction of the injury. The soft parts, down to the bone, integuments, cellular substance, muscles, and periosteum, w'ere all much thickened from the interposition of con- solidated lymph, consequent upon long preceding inflammation. The periosteum was extensively dis- eased, thickened, and highly vascular round the wounds, to a considerable distance. The apertures in the bone were nearly blocked up with an adher- ing gelatinous substance, separable only by macera-

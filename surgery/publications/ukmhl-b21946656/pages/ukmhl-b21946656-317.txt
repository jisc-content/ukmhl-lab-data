301 toms; the stump became daily more painful, but without swelling or inflammation; the granula-* tions retaining their peculiar white glistening and indolent appearance. At length, the skin became moist, and his pulse softer and less frequent, but the irritability of the system was evidently increas- ed, accompanied by a disposition to spasmodic ac- tion in the muscles, particularly those of the face. On the 22d July, he became suddenly very un- easy and restless, and died on the morning of the 23d. Upon examination after death, the femoral vein was found ulcerated at its cut extremity ; all the large veins of the stump were found to have been inflamed; they were remarkably vascular, and their coats very much thickened. Unfortu- nately, from the great pressure of duty, the state of the vena cava was not examined. There could be little doubt, however, that the inflammation had extended to the heart. There was a small collection of matter on the outer surface of the femur, and also in the sub- stance of the bone near its cut extremity, where there was a considerable deposition of bone in the form of sharp spicula*, pointing toward the trunk of the body, but no marks of commencing separa- tion of the dead from the sound parts.

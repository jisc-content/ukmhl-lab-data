470 had been there dissolved by quicksilver ; he then operated upon a West Indian Governor by the mer- curial injection, for the removal of a piece of a leaden bougie, which had broke short in his blad- der. All France rung with this new and ingenious operation, and the contriver was so far deceived as to affirm that the lead was discharged; but on the Governorâ€™s death, which occurred some time after, the identical piece of lead was found in his bladder. * The use of mercury has also been at times adopted for the removal of leaden balls from other parts, but without success; in some cases, it has insinuated itself among the cancelli of the bones, the fibres of the muscles, and the tendinous sheaths, and produced great irritation. Depositions of calcareous matter are often form- ed in the bladder after its coats have been injured by a wound. In a case lately operated upon by Staff-surgeon Dease, it was nearly filled with loose- ly compacted urinary depositions, part without any visible nucleus, some masses with splinters ol bone for their nuclei, and, in several points, the calcareous crust adhering to the internal coat ol the bladder itself. The patient was wounded in the anterior part of the viscus, and suffered most severe torture during the protraction of his life for three years. Circumstances forbad the examina- tion of the body after death. * Vide Percy, page 137.

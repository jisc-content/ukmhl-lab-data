is still, however, our duty to try every expedient J and, after the ragged parts and splinters of bone are removed, the vessels within reach secured, and the suppurating process fairly established, we may endeavour to assist nature, faithfully following any effort she may make to fill up the chasm, but without allowing ourselves to count upon a showy or complete cure. By strict attention in this way, I saw a horrid looking case, where nearly one-half of the face was carried away by a round shot at Waterloo, in very fair progress of contraction, un- der the care of my friend Staff-surgeon Roach. The various nerves that may be injured in wounds of the face, give rise to a great variety of paralytic and spasmodic affections and distortions, which do not come within the power of art to re- medy. I have seldom met hemorrhages about the face that were not very readily relieved by the li- gature of the small vessels, or graduated pressure applied, either to the wound or along the artery implicated; still less to observe any, requiring the experiment of tying the carotid trunk, al- though such necessity has occurred to others. * beg to refer to his book, now translated by Mr Waller, surgeon of the navy, p. 130, where the ingenious mode of feeding the patient and of covering his deformity afterwards, are fully shown. * Vide Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. VII. papers bj StaiT-surgeon Collier. I witnessed the cure, though not the operation. It appeared perfectly complete.

341 and often in combination. The first and most simple cause has proceeded from actual violence, which has partially separated a portion of the ce- rebral mass, and has been obvious at the first dres- sing of the wound. The second has succeeded the removal of the support of the bony case, or the mem- branes, either by the original wound, by operation, or by subsequent inflammation and sloughing. The , third class lias been the effect of contusion, produ- cing a morbid alteration of the brain itself, * which either comes forth unaltered in appearance, or shoots out a bloody coagulum, arising from a ruptured ves- sel, or else pushes forth a new product, easily and safely separable by the knife, and quickly renewed, like fungus growth in other parts ; or, lastly, pro- ceeds from a gradual but often extensive breaking down of the brain into a bloody pulpy mass, which appears to issue forth by its own fluidity, uncon- nected with any propelling action of the blood- vessels. Examinations after death, which is the general result of these cases, give ample proofs of the exist- ence of protrusions from coagulated blood ; and that proceeding from the substance of the brain itself is obvious, both during life, from the appearance of the substance protruded, and from the examinations * The disposition may exist without a fracture, as has been observed by Dr Thomson. Vide his Report, p. 57- Schmuc- ker also notices this alteration of the brain ; and it is not un- frequently met with after death in cases of gunshot injuries.

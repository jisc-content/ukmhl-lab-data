119 in their own persons, each suffering a severe compound fracture of the limb, and each sub- mitting to, and directing the application of, the rules they had laid down for the treatment of those accidents*. The relaxed position of Pott was carried by himself to the very highest state of improvement; but Pare’s was progressively amending from his own lime down to that of Desault and Boyer. A due consideration of both the methods will, however, shew us, that in neither are all the muscles fully relaxed ; and we are in both obliged to a certain extent, to pa- ralyse them by our pressure, and by our long- continued extension. In cases so tedious in their cure as gun-shot fractures, the question will, in some degree, resolve itself into one of conve- nience to the patient and his surgeon ; and I am warranted, from most ample experience, to infer, that lying on the back with the limb extended, is by far the most tolerable to the patient, and admits of much easier access and dressing ; and, what is still more important, is, in its ultimate success, equal, if not superior, to either the bent position of Pott, the patient on his side, or the semiflexion of the knee, the patient on his back, and the limb in a fracture box, as recommended by Mr. Charles BelH* and others. * Vide Pare, lib. xv, chap. 23 and 21, and Pott’s Life, pre- fixed to his Works, by Earle. + Vide Operative Surgery, vol. ii. p.346, Ed. 2 Lond. 1814.

209 wounded nerves, and even of the phenomena attend- ing them our knowledge is limited. In the living subject, according to Prochaska, a divided nerve retracts, and the medulla is expelled from its ex- tremities, but more copiously from the upper than the lower end. In many cases, however, particu- larly in the axilla, the nerves protrude consider- ably, so as to require removal in cases of high am- putation. The ends of divided nerves are united by a new formed matter, but it has been disputed, whether this was real medullary matter or not. Dr Haighton, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795, proves that this new matter will perform the functions of a nerve, and this appears to me con- clusive upon the point. These functions are, howT- ever, restored but very slowly, and not by any means uniformly. Nor does the assertion of Cu- vier, that the power of motion is restored upon the re-union, but the sensation lost, universally hold good. The total division of a partially wounded nerve is the only operation recognised by modern surgeons. The experiment is, however, hazardous and uncertain, and I have principally confined myself to venesection, with emollients to the parts, which I have employed with advantage where the accident was suspected. CEdema is a very frequent consequence of gun- shot injuries of the extremities, and is generally complicated with pressure on the lymphatics, or in- jury to the nerves, either immediately, or from the p

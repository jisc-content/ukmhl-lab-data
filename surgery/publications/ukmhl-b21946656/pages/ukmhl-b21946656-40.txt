Every surgeon will naturally have the best instruments he can procure ; but it may not be amiss to remind him that his knives will often appendage to an array, furnished with their field medicines and materials. In the fifteenth century the field surgeons came into some note; they were principally attached to the general officers, and, although obliged to act as combatants, received a certain portion of booty and prisoners. The field surgeon of Henry V. of England (Nicholas Colnet) received a yearly sum of forty marks, in addition to his share of plunder; but Nicholas had to furnish three archers; and if his booty exceeded twenty pounds, he was to give up one third to his Majesty.—Vide Beckman’s History of Inventions, by Johnson, voL iv. 2d Edition.

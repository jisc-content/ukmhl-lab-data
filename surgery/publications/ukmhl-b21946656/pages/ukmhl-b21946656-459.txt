443 had a stool by a regular passage, from which pe- riod the artificial one began gradually to close ; and in about five months, it had contracted to less than a fourth of its original size, being scarcely perceptible, and no feces issuing from it. The general health of this man had not suffered in the smallest degree, which, I think, was to be attri- buted to the adhesion between the intestine and the abdominal parietes having been completed be- fore the sloughing took place, and the parts be- came more exposed, and to the very mild and un- irritating treatment that was subsequently adopt- ed. * CASE. James Monaghan, 40th regiment, was wound- ed on the 28th July 1813, by a musket ball, which struck him in an oblique direction, and entered exactly over that part of Poupart’s ligament of the right side, under which the artery runs. Its in- ternal track cannot of course be ascertained, but it went out at a point of the left or opposite side, nearly corresponding to that at which the sciatic nerve and posterior crural vessels pass. He im- mediately lost the power of moving the right limb * Dr Charles Forbes often saw poor Jackson.—A very in- structive case, much resembling this, is given by Vater in the Philosophical Transactions; it look place in a camp follower, wounded at the battle of Ramillies, and continued for fourteen years.

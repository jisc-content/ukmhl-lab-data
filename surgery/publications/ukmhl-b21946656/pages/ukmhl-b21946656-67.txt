51 is frequently the sole reward of the military sur* geon ; it will solace him under such unmerited reproach; and under its influence, and with science and experience for his guides, he will sometimes see causes for hope, under circum- stances of apparently desperate ill omen. Where a compound fracture happens from a musket ball, at a distance from a joint, with- out great destruction of the soft parts, or splin- tering of the bone, or separation of its periosteum to any great extent, and where we conceive it possible to effect the salvation of the limb, we must pick away all the splinters of bone or shell, bits of cloth, dirt, &c. that we conveniently can. If there are sharp pieces of bone sticking out, we saw them off, and then apply the many- headed bandage and proper splints, cushioned off by towr or rags.

If the fracture is of the humerus or fore-arm, we may be more particular in mak- ing our extension and coaptation, and apply our bandages and splints with the view to their re- maining more permanently fixed than we can in fractures of the lower extremity, particularly the thigh ; for, in the latter case, it is utterly impossible to set the limb as it ought to be upon e 2

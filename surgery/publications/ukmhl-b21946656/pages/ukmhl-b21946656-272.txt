Brug- mans has clearly ascertained that there exists in it a peculiar animal matter highly disposed to putre- faction, that the oxygen gas is considerably dimi- nished, and the azote and carbonic acid gas aug- mented ; and that by the tests of nitrate of silver, acetate of lead, and oxygenated muriatic acid gas, the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen gas is detected.

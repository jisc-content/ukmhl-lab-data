From those considerations, would it not be most prudent to let the removal of the bead of the bone be al- ways a secondary operation ? Where splinters stick out from a wound in or close to the shoulder joint, or are loose, and within safe and easy reach, and the surgeon supposes the limb is not irretrievably in- jured, let them be removed, and the edges that might irritate be pared or sawed off; let the ori- ginal inflammation and fever subside; and then, if the diseased state of the bone and soft parts be- comes evidently defined in its extent, let the oper- ation for sawing off the head and unsound parts of the bone be attempted. * But where there is not perfect soundness of constitution to bear up against fever, formation of matter, and repeated exfolia- tions, life may often be lost in the attempt to save the limb.

If great difficulty of breathing, or haemorrhage from the mouth, with sudden paleness and laborious pulse, in the one case; or deadly faintness, coldness of the extremities, and the discharge of stercoracious matter from the wound, in the secondâ€”are not present; we shall lind that perhaps the ball has coursed alongunder the integuments, and is marked in its progress either by what Mr. Hunter compares to a blush, or by a wheal, or dusky line, terminated by a tu- mour; on opening which,it will be easily extract- ed. In some of these long and circuitous routes of balls, where we have not this mark, a certain emphysematous crackling discovers its course and leads to its detection. The ball is, in many instances, found very close to its point of en- trance, having nearly com pleted the circuit of the body.

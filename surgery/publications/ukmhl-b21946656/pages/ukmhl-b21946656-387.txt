Injuries from musket balls, although at first of little apparent consequence, are eventually produc- tive of great and disgusting inconveniences; and those from fragments of shell or round shot often communicate their effects to the brain, particularly if fracturing the malar prominence and parts adja- cent, while, if they injure the lower parts, the or- gans of speech and of mastication are seriously and sometimes irrecoverably affected. Great secondary injury is produced by the fre- quent exfoliations of bone, and deep-seated forma- tions of matter, occasioned by a musket ball passing through or shaking the bones of the nose, or pene- trating the maxillary sinuses, the effect of which may be felt for years. The balls often get partially split and entangled among the irregular shaped bones forming the face and upper jaw, resisting all at- tempts at removing them for years, until they have pioduced by their irritation large puffy tumours, extensive ulceration, and caries in the bones, and sloughing of the mucous membranes which invest them. In all cases where it is at all possible, the extraction should be made internally, to obviate deformity.

21.1 they became carious throughout, andsloughed away; and the caries assumed the circular form, in strict correspondence with the shape of the soft parts. In some cases, a total absorption of the phosphate of lime took place, and the bone was converted in- to a cartilaginous mass; this circumstance I have met with twice, once in a diseased metacarpal bone, and once in the femur. In the former case, the dissecting-knife cut through the bone with as little difficulty as if it had gone through the cartilages of the ribs. The latter case was very remarkable; the patient suffered acute tor- ture from a sloughing thigh stump, which, on an accurate examination, displayed the following ap- pearances : A thickened cutaneous texture, hung like a loose pouch around a hard projecting mass, apparently consisting of diseased muscle ; within which, corresponding to the size and situation of the bone, appeared a tough, dark body, exquisitely sensible. It had been touched with escharotics, lay loosely, and, on removal by a forceps, had all the external appearance of a stopper of cartilage, about two inches in length. On examining the spot more closely, the whole of the parts contain- ed within the diseased skin appeared of the same nature, and the disease seemed to spread up to the trochanter. The patient had been affected only fourteen days ; and for the last four, the disease appeared stationary. An operation was resolved on, which I performed, by first taking up the fe* r

In some of these cases, the course of the ball is so ob- scure, and its pluce of lodgment so uncertain, that it can only be detected in death. In the last case of this kind which I examined, we found the ball lodged deep in the great trochanter \ but as the patient lay in bed, its entrance was so completely covered by the tendon of the obturator externus, as to preclude the possibility of detection. It is pos- sible, if the surgeon is early called in, and can at once decide on the nature of the case, that the ap- plication of the crown of a trephine, aided by strong forceps, may enable him to remove the ball if thus lodged ; but in general the encouragement to attempt such an operation is but slender, and little hope remains but from the performance of amputation at the joint,—a truly awful alternative. It sometimes happens that partial fractures of the neck of the femur take place from gunshot in- juries, which for a long time escape detection ; other injuries also of the joint have their founda- tion laid on the infliction of the wound, and only develope themselves in the progress of its treat- ment, when little or nothing can be done for them. Of this kind I have been furnished by Staff Sur- geon Hughes with the following interesting case of spontaneous luxation :— 11

56 under the immediate orders of the purveying officers, every species of filth and nuisance ought to be most carefully removed from tlie rooms, staircases, galleries, and passages of the various buildings; which should be, if possible, white- washed ; the kitchens repaired, or new ones erected ; the necessaries cleaned, and proper drains cut from them, or fresh pits sunk ; the tanks, wells, pumps, or pipes, placed in proper repair, and under strict controul ; places of se- curity set aside for the arms, &c. of the men, and for the stores of the purveyor and apothecary ; and all that variety of preparation made which experience may suggest, and which the spur of the moment, or the nature of the service and of the accommodation, may demand. There is, perhaps, no body of men more thought- less, when left to themselves, than soldiers : they have been so long accustomed to have all their wants supplied or anticipated, and have, in fact, been so completely transformed into machines, actuated and directed by their superiors, that, if uncontrouled, they are either helpless or dege- nerate. It is then that one of their characteris- tics, while under the eye of their officers, is com- pletely laid aside. In their absence, and in the indulgence which they suppose a residence in a hospital implies, they forget, or wilfully neglect, the most obvious means of cleanliness and regu- larity, and sink into filth, sloth, and debauchery.

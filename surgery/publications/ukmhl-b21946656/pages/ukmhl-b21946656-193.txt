This was combated by the older surgeons, by fumigations with the smoke of aromatic gums, or balsams, as benzoin, &c. The application of simple heat by steam, gentle friction, and moderate exercise of the joints, will soon re- store their mobility. I have met lately with a secondary species of contraction, which admits of no relief that I am acquainted with.

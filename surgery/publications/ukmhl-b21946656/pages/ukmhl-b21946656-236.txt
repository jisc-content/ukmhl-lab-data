The inefficiency of Fumigations is now pretty gene- rally acknowledged by their most sanguine ad- mirers ; where I have lately employed them, it has been more from a compliance with custom, than from any conviction of their utility. That some of them correct the foetor of the discharges from suppurating surfaces, is well known, and in such cases they have their merits ; and if they cheer the spirits of the wounded, or tend to promote the circulation of air, they are not to be entirely re- jected ; but where they, in the slightest degree, interfere with thorough ventilation, or cleanliness, they must be hurtful.

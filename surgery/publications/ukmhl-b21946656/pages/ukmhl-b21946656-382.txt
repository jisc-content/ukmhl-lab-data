S66 I have met with one or two cases of amau? rosis from wounds of the supraorbital nerve ; the perfect division of the nerve produced no allevia- tion of the complaint, but, after some time, the eye partially recovered. In the unfortunate injuries of this delicate or- gan, very painful consequences ensue, and fungi to a great size, and of a most irritable nature, occasion- ally protrude. I have seen many gallant men driven almost to desperation by the agony they suffered, which nothing but large and frequently repeated doses of laudanum could subdue. The means which I would recommend are : First, if the globe of the eye is irreparably injured, as in almost every case it is, at once to evacuate the accumulated hu- mours by a free and deep incision. By this means, we sometimes are enabled to extract the bullet, if it lies in or near the orbit. The parts should then be covered with the lightest and mildest possible dressings, and with cold applications, al- though sometimes we find that warm fomenta- tions, and sometimes cloths dipped in spirituous lotions, give most relief.

If inflammation runs very high after one copious general bleeding, leeches should be applied, and continued, if the

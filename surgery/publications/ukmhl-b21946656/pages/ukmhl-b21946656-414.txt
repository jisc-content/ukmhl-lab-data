If it is gun- shot, a light mild dressing will be sufficient; but if incised, the lips of it should be closed at once ; and this treatment will be found to afford the most certain preventive to emphysema, future he- morrhage, or collections of matter. I scarcely re- collect an instance where it was necessary to re- move the adhesive straps, or (where it was gun- shot) the usual dressings. We now lay the man down, and let him remain as quiet as possible, and in as cool and airy a spot of the barn, church, or hospital as we can find. He will often require no further aid ; but if the case is very severe, he will possibly lie for some hours in a state of compara- tive ease, till the vessels again pour forth their contents, and induce fresh spitting of bloody froth, and a repetition of all the symptoms of approach- ing suffocation. The lancet must again be had recourse to ; and if, by this management, repeated as often as circumstances demand, the patient survives the first twelve hours, hopes may begin to be entertained of his recovering the immediate ef- fects of hemorrhage. In the after-treatment of a wound of the nature here described, we shall be considerably assisted by the aid of medicine ; but until the danger of immediate death from hemor- rhage is over, we must not think of employing any

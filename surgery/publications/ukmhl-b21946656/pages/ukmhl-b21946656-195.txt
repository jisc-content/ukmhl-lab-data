179 Much will depend upon a small ball or sabre cut partially opening the vessel in its transverse or longitudinal direction ; but fatal experience shows us, that the numbers who die from the opening of a large and principal artery by shot, shell, or sabre, however inflicted, so pre-eminently exceed the sur- vivors, as to set all calculation at defiance. How the vessels escape so often as they do, has been a source of great surprise among surgeons, and is truly wonderful. Balls buff'along them, pass be- tween them, and traverse their courses in all pos- sible directions, but leave them unhurt. Their elasticity has been considered as in a great measure contributing to this effect, and no doubt it does. Something also may depend upon their being in a state of dilatation or otherwise when the missile passes across them, * but still much is left unex- plained in the attempt at accounting for these phe- nomena. Where a round shot injures a large ves- sel, or a sabre divides it, (the carotid for instance, or the femoral,) immediate death is almost univer- sally the consequence. Where a vessel of this class is opened within the cavities, no chance of recovery remains the cause and effects are al- most simultaneous, and even in the first case death * Vide Morgagni, Letter 53, Obs. 34. A case was report- ed as having occurred in Flanders, where the ball passed close under the arch of the aorta, and the patient survived some days. The ball certainly passed in that direction, but not having ex- amined the body after death, I cannot vouch for the fact.

202 Injuries of the Nerves. The mechanical injuries of the nerves are en- tirely beyond the powers of art to relieve effectual- ly ; but they are objects of great curiosity, and il- lustrative of many most important symptoms that occur in the course of practice. Complete divi- sions of a principal nerve are instantaneously fol- lowed by a total ioss of motion and sense in the parts supplied by it. In partial lesions, the priva- tion is not so complete. A secondary paralysis very frequently takes place without any immediate injury of the nerve, as in those cases where a ball has passed so close to a large one, or the plexus from which it proceeds, as to occasion an inflam- mation and consequent thickening of the neuri- lema or investing membrane ; or where, in a more distant transit of the ball, the tube formed by its passage swells to an extent sufficient to press on the nerve or plexus. In some cases, the loss of motion and sensation on the injury of a nerve, either by a direct or par- tial division, does not take place to an equal ex- tent, in all the parts between the injury and the extreme points of the limb. I have seen several cases where the nerves have been injured in their passage down the humerus, and the extremities of the fingers alone suffered, all the intermediate parts

In the more fortunate few who have recovered, those matters have been dis- charged from the wounds, or extracted from them by the surgeons. In some lucky cases, they have been ejected by the convulsive efforts to cough, which their irritation has occasioned. In speaking of extraneous bodies generally, I have shown how often a ball, striking the body, or a limb, will run round under the skin, and appear to penetrate right across the member or the cavity. By the deep-seated course which they sometimes take, the deception is rendered still greater. Thus, I have traced a ball by dissection, passing into the cavity of the thorax, making the circuit of the lungs, pe- netrating nearly opposite the point of entrance, and giving the appearance of the man being shot fairly across, while bloody sputa seemed to prove the fact, and, in reality, rendered the same mea- sures, to a certain extent, as necessary as if the case had been literally as suspected. The bloody sputa, however, were only secondary, and neither so active or alarming as those which pour at once from the lungs when wounded.

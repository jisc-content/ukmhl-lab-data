To perform the amputation at the shoulder joint, I have for some years exclusively employed the mode by a flap formed from the acromion to the centre of the axilla on each side by a gentle curve, first through the skin and cellular substance on the outside of the arm, then on the inner, so as to mark the flaps and guide the future strokes of the knife ; then, with a middle sized amputating knife I cut nearly down to the bone on each side. I then, taking the pointed slip of deltoid, which remains attached to the acromion, lay it down quickly with a scalpel, so as to expose the head of: the bone, which I now proceed to luxate *, this is done with the greatest ease and certainty by throwing the shattered remains of the arm back- ward, and thus exposing the long head of the ten- don of the biceps ; by dividing this tendon, and running the scalpel fairly forward along the groove, its back lying in it as in a director, we are at once conducted into the joint. I have witnessed considerable difficulty in hitting the articulation by the omission of this simple step, which will be entirely avoided if it is adopted ; and, indeed, will enable the surgeon to enter the joint blindfolded. By carrying the scalpel fairly round, the capsular ligament is divided from the bone. Resuming the amputating knife, with one sweep in the axilla the two lateral flaps are united, the limb removed,

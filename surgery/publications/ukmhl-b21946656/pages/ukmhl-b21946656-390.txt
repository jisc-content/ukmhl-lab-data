In injuries of the parotid duet 1 have in a few in- stances derived advantage from making the division complete by a clean incision across and into the mouth, and closely bringing together the edges of the wound on the outside of the cheek. The na- tural flow of the saliva into the moigh has render- ed the wound on that side (with the occasional aid of a little lunar caustic) indisposed to fill up. We are, however, often disappointed in this fortunate result, and a constant dribbling, with depositions of tartar around the wound, succeeds. Pressure upon the duct, so as to obliterate it, or at least to obli- terate its point, has been proposed, but the prac- tice is very dubious ; excruciating pain and im- mense swelling of the parotid gland, with a gene- ral oedema of the neighbouring parts, almost con- stantly succeeding. An ingenious proposal has been stated and practised by the French surgeons to prevent the uncleanly dribbling of saliva, viz. the obliteration of the secreting gland altogether, by compression. This, it is said, is done with perfect safety, and the other gland completely supplies its place by an increased secretion. I have never tried the experiment; but I doubt the fortitude of pa- tients in general to bear the necessary pressure. * * Vide Desault par Bichat, Tom.

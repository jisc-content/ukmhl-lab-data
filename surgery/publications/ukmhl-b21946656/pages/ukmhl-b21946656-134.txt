The bent and the extended position of the limbs lias each its advocates. Much as Eng- lish surgery owes to Mr. Pott, it is chiefly in- debted to him for his excellent remarks on Frac- tures ; he first placed in its proper point of view the rational mode of evading or moderating the powerful action of the muscles. The posture recommended by him has, for years, been adopt- ed as the proper one in British practice; in France, however, a directly opposite mode is pursued, and not without considerable success.

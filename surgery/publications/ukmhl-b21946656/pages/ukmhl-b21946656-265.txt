249 Hemorrhage frequently occurred about the period of the separation of the sloughs ; it was best re- strained by pressure with a sponge, or compress, dipped in oleum terebinthin®. When the main artery gave way, amputation, as high up as pos- sible, was our only chance of saving life ; indeed, this dreadful alternative was, in a great majority of cases, rendered indispensable, not from hemor- rhage alone, but from the extensive loss of sub- stance occasioning destruction of the joints, and from other sequel® of the gangrene. The question of amputation, though a subject of much discussion in cases of common gangrene, could, in the hospital gangrene that I have been describing, admit of no hesitation. For, although the line of separation neither need, or ought to be waited for, in several cases of the former de- scription, yet the phenomena of the disease, and the appearances on dissection, forcibly impressed the impropriety of attempting to operate before the fever had abated, and the sloughs began na- turally to detach themselves. To give amputation every possible chance of success, separation was indispensable : the skin was detached as little as possible from the muscles, and the bleeding from the smaller vessels was restrained by pressure, and dossils of lint dipped in ol. terebinth, while the li- gature on the larger trunks was applied as de- scribed already, by cutting short both its ends. * * Dr Forbes witnessed, with the utmost anxiety, the whole progress of this epidemic, and Statf-surgeon Boggie, and Messrs

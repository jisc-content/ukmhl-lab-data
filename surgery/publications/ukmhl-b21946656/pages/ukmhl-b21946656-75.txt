59 or other temporary means of removing the beds from the surface of the floor; for, independently of the comfort and cleanliness, and the obviating of damp, it is a fact, now well known in military hospitals, that the lower portion of the atmos- phere of the occupied wards is invariably the least- proper for respiration, and that in which sores heal most slowly. To establish this proposition in an unanswera- ble manner, M. Brugmans resorted to chemical agents. The results were, that even in the best regulated and constructed hospitals, and in which no case of hospital gangrene exists, the layer of air nearest the floor contains a larger proportion of carbonic acid gas than that of the higher parts of the same ward. At the height of two feet, sometimes even two feet and a half, the proportion of carbonic acid gas is commonly to -J&, and close to the floor, -4ft j and even a larger proportion has been observed! ° The flame of a candle, made to approach the floor, visibly fades ; and lime water, in an open vessel, rapidly becomes opaque. * •Vide “ Annales de Litterature, &c." par MM.

I have observed, on various occasions,

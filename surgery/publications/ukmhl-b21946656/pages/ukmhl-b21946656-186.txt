170 brane, effusion into the joint itself, and into the bursa; in its neighbourhood, are the derangements principally to be observed, the connections or or- ganization ofâ€™ the bones and surrounding muscles not being affected in these early stages. * Balls often pass through or along the bones of the hand or foot, and, except in very severe cases attended with great loss of substance, amputation of the member is not immediately necessary. The strength of the fascia covering those parts, and the number of minute bones composing them, will, how- ever, render extensive openings peculiarly requi- site. These bones never suffer from necrosis, nor do they ever become regenerated, as far as my ex- perience goes ; but if the aid of an appropriate sup- porting splint, assisted by proper bandages, is had recourse to, their loss is soon supplied by a new formation of soft parts, approaching to a cartilagin- ous nature ; and by the approximation of the sound bones to each other. However desirable it may be to save a hand or foot, yet, in severe lacerations, the frequency of tetanic affections should at once lead us to adopt immediate amputation. The injuries occasioned by balls lodging near or about the joint of the hip, are among the most * I have met one case where, I am confident, had the ball been looked for in time, the limb might have been saved. It lay for three weeks under the ligament of the patella, until at last all distinction of parts was confounded in wide spreading inflam- mation.

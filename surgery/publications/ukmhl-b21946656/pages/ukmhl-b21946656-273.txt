257 sively leading to the formation of a correct opinion of the particular spot to be operated upon, and the precise period to attempt the operation : and where mortification has been produced from causes exist- ing only in the constitution, or where, by sym- pathy, it has been originally led to suffer, and has at last become completely implicated, we can have no better guide. Could we set bounds to this con- stitutional affection, and prevent it from degenerat- ing into an action by which the safety of the whole system is threatened, we need never seek any other; but, unfortunately, we too frequently meet with cases, and particularly in military sur- gery, where this saving constitutional effort is ne- ver made, or not made until too late, and where to wait for it, is therefore to expose the patient to certain death. The division of mortification into traumatic and spontaneous, as laid down by M. Larrey, * is one of great practical importance ; it has been deduced from long and attentive observation ; it is consistent with what the practice of every military surgeon must have suggested, and it fully justifies the adop- tion of the rule of conduct announced by him, viz. ' “ that when mortification is the result of a mecha- nical cause, and puts the patient’s life in danger, we need not wait until the disorder has ceased to spread.” * Memoires dc* Chirurgie Militaire, Tom. iii. p. 142. et se- quent.

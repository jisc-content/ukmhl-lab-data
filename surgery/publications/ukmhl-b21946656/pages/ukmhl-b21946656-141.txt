which, in simple fracture, supports, as in a case, and sustains the vitality of every part of the bone to which it adheres, is lacerated to a greater or leaser extent, and in part destroyed ; the invaria- ble effect of which is, extensive inflammation and thickening of that membrane, followed by the death of those pieces of bone, whether detached or not, which are deprived of it. The first stage, therefore, of compound fracture, is one demand- ing the most rigid antiphlogistic treatment, the most perfect ease and quiet of the patient, and, except in regulating the fever, requiring but little aid from mere surgery, beyond the removal of detached splinters and extraneous bodies. Much, however, may be done by proper manage- ment, particularly of the beds. As the irregu- larities of an ordinary paillasse would obviously injure our patients, one great source of comfort and ease to them, will be, preparing a set of well-stuffed cases of combed straw', wool, chaff, or any other material that may be procured, and placing them on the firmest wooden bedsteads we can get, or on boards and tressels. As it often happens that these cannot be procured, then the paillasses must be placed on the floor, guarded from the damp and cold, if the nature of our hospitals exposes them to such causes, by tarpaulins or water deek ; and occasional irre- gularities must be corrected by bolsters, cushions of chaff, hair, wool, &c.

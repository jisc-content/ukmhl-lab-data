I have seen several instances in which fever, intense pain, and even death, have followed such a wanton interference wdth the operations of Nature. If the periosteum is not irrecoverably damaged, partial or even entirely new formation may take place, and the separate portion of bone will re-unite ; if it is, Nature will herself point out the necessity for removal, by the gradual loosen- ing of the parts, ascertainable by the linger or probe. The two following cases bear strongly on this point ; and the latter serves to illustrate some of the observations made on the extraction of balls. CASE. A French prisoner of war had been wound- ed by a musket-ball in the left leg. It fractured the tibia about two and ahalfor three inches above the ankle-joint. The fracture extended longi- tudinally, and as several loose pieces of bone were ascertained to exist, it was proposed to extract them by an incision, as they seemed the only obstacle to the completion of the cure and final recovery of the limb.

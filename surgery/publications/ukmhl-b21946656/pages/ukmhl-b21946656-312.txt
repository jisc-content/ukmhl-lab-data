It was turbid, and there floated on it a great number of yellow flakes, re- sembling those which are discharged from scrofu- lous abscesses. There were no preternatural ad- hesions between the lung on this side and the pleura ; its colour was very dark, and its whole substance was crowded with small tubercles about the size of garden peas. These bodies were of a grey colour and Arm consistence, nearly resembling indurated lymphatic glands. The lower part of the left lung, both to the touch and to the eye, ap- peared quite healthy ; towards its root a number of tubercles were felt, on cutting into which yellow pus was found.

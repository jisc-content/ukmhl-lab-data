with considerable violence during the evening, and is at present very severe. The swelling, hardness, and tension of the abdomen have in- creased considerably during the day ; his pulse is intermitting, low, and tremulous; it is also very quick ; his countenance has assumed a leaden hue ; he lias frequent retchings, and he sometimes vomits up a greenish-yellow matter ; he is very restless, and thirsty ; he passes his urine freely ; his stools are copious, and evacu- ated without difficulty. Let him be immediately put into a warm bath ; after which, let a blister be applied to the abdomen, and injection of decoct, of lintseed be thrown up every two hours. Eight o'Clock.—The w arm bath produced a general diaphoresis, and an alleviation of the acute pain in the abdomen ; the swelling and tension of the abdomen were also considerably reduced: his pulse, however, was not raised, and it continues very quick, weak, tremulous, and intermitting. His breathing is become short and laborious; he has had one evacuation by stool since he came out of the warm bath ; he has had no return of vomiting since six o’clock. The pain having been relieved by the bath, the blister was not applied. He has just now taken half a pint of warm gruel, with about an ounce of wine and a little sugar : this is to be repeated every two hours, and the fomentation and glyster continued.

4 52 In a my few singularly fortunate cases of this kind, life has been preserved; but this event does not take place in one case of a thousand, and al- most instant death succeeds the injury. The sud- den shock, and the withdrawing their usual sup- port from the abdominal contents, seems quite sufficient to produce the fatal event. I have, however, seen two cases, where the de- struction of the patient was not immediately effect- ed. In one, the great arch of the colon was com- pletely laid bare by a round shot, and the patient was reported to me alive within a week after the event; (indeed, I may here observe, that injuries of the colon are by no means so dangerous as those of other parts of the canal,) the other was a truly melancholy picture of the dreadful effects of the explosion of a shell. An officer of infantry was brought into the hospital of the Jesuits at Brussels in a waggon ; he was laid on a mattress in the room used as an operating-room ; and was in his turn examined by myself and the other surgeons employed on the occasion. Surrounded though we were by the dead and the dying, this case was pre-eminently horrible ; almost the whole anterior part of the abdominal parietes had been blown off, with the exception of the peritoneum, which still remained, though sorely lacerated, and deprived of the muscles ; where the umbilicus had been, there was a large rent through which the omen- tum protruded, though not to a great extent, and scarcely above the surface, spots of the stomach.

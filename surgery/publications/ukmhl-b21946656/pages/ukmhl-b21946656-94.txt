The natural anxiety which every wounded man feels to have the supposed cause of his pain removed, and the praises which he and his friends so liberally bes- tow on a successful operation, have, at all times, made surgeons anxious in the invention of those very ingenious arid very useless articles, bullet extractors; the employment of which is com- pletely superseded by the common forceps ; or still more by that of M. Percy, used with a little ingenuity ; for wherever a bulky and compli- cated bullet extractor can enter, the former in- struments can go down with infinitely greater ease; but, unfortunately for both instruments, we most require their mechanical power in tor- tuous passages, or deep-curved and angular cavities, where we can least use them. The great point is, to discover where the extraneous mat ter lies; and he must possess very little manual dexterity indeed who cannot remove it from the soft parts, if the removal is adviseable*. These bodies naturally divide * Those who have neither leisure nor opportunity to consult the original authors, will find a very learned and satisfactory account of the means used by the older surgeons for the ex- traction of foreign bodies in the “ Tableau rapide des difl'e- “ rens instruments, etc.” inserted by M. Percy in his “ Ma- “ nuel du Chirurgien d’Armeeand a very good summary account of their superstitious and peculiar notions concerning wounds, will be found in the “Liber Quintus Practice

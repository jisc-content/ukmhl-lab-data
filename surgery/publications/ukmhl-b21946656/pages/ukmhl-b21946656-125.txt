' 109 CASE. Samuel Holt met with an accident nearly similar to that detailed in the former case, and the treatment was conducted upon the same plan ; but in spite of every remedy that could be employed, he sunk in twenty-two hours and a half after he received the blow. On the contents of the abdomen being ex- posed, a large circular hole was discovered in one of the convolutions of the jejunum. It was situated in contact with the peritonaeum, about two inches obliquely below, and to the right of the umbilicus. The fibres of the intestine sur- rounding the hole, had the same appearance as is generally presented by the margin of a re- cently contused wound ; the whole of the small intestines had a bright-red colour from the nu- merous ramifications of their inflamed vessels. That part of the canal extending a few inches above and below the hole, was remarkably in- flamed ; and the vessels had already secreted a purulent-like matter, which adhered to the surface of the intestines in its vicinity. About two quarts of yellowish fluid was extravasated in the pelvis, and among the convolutions of the intestines ; the peritoneum was highly in- flamed, to a considerable extent, in the neigh- bourhood of the injury. The bladder was empty and collapsed, as were also the large intes- tines.

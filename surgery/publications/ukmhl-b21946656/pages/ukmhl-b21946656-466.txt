I cut off both ends of the ligature, as recommended by Mr Benjamin Bell, (although the first step towards that improvement seems to have originated w'ith M. Verdrier, who, in 1731, observing that the ligatures in gastroraphy occa- sioned a greater flow of matter than all the rest of the wound, cut off one of the threads, *) a perfect cure was effected in a few days in both cases. Of Mr Travers’s mode, which has been found suc- cessful by others who have had an opportuni- ty of employing it, I have no personal experi- ence. If the intestine is strangulated in a small open- ing, a few cautious touches of the bistoury will be sufficient to ensure their reduction, and if it be not highly inflamed, or evidently disorganized, it may be returned unsecured. Within this short time, a soldier of the 38th regiment, under my inspec- tion, at Gloucester, was gored by a cow j the intes- tines protruded, and, although the peritoneal coat * Memoires de l’Academ.

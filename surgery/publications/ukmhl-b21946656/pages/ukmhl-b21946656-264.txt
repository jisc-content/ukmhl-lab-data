248 seventh day, appeared to break through the black sloughs, the edges of the circle lost their retorted and tumid appearance, and the looks and spirits of the poor sufferers considerably improved. The slough soon began to loosen, and, at this stage, I think, the use of powdered rhubarb externally was attended with beneficial effect, and assisted much in cleansing the sores. In some cases, however, the sloughs were amazingly tenacious, and required a strong solution of lunar caustic. (In those cases the diluted Fowlerâ€™s solution of arsenic, looked upon as a specific escharotic by some, will be found very serviceable in cleansing the sores ; but, what- ever is used, no violence should be employed.) A much more important object than the separation of the slough, was the removal of the patient to an airy and separate ward, as no disease was more apt to recur than this. I have seen a case, in which, in spite of our utmost endeavours, the wretched patient suffered thirteen different re- lapses, and at last sunk under the violence of the repeated attacks. These occurred from the slightest local irritation, or error of diet, and sometimes without any apparent cause whatever, and at a period when cicatrization wras rapidly going on. They also at times occurred without any increase of fever ; a small livid, or red spot, covered with a glairy tenacious purulent matter, suddenly mak- ing its appearance, and, however frequently de- stroyed, still continuing to increase, until at last the whole sore again assumed the sloughing state.

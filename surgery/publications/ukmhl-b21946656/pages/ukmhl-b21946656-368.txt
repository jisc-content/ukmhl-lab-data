Wounds of the head, which are not productive of the dreadful symptoms of concussion or com- pression, often lay the foundation of very trouble- some spongy sores and indolent exfoliations, at- tended with extreme lieadachs, and sometimes amounting to inflammation of the brain or its me- ninges, and even to the formation of matter on or between these parts. The general principles appli- cable to inflamed parts, and to exfoliating bones, are applicable here, but requiring a promptness * proportioned to the importance of the organ con- cerned. The throwing off of a scale is more ra- pid, and a granulating surface of new growth suc- ceeds more frequently upon the bones of the skull after an injury producing exfoliation than on other bones; but if the symptoms do not soon yield, it would be manifestly improper to wait for exfolia- tion, when, by the simple application of the crown of the trephine, we can at once remove the source of irritation. On this point, as well'as on the en- tire class of injuries, I cannot too often refer to the excellent Pott. * The tendency to relapse, left after injuries of the head have been got safely over, is very great, and demands for its prevention a rigorous system of abstinence of all kinds, little palatable to mill- * See particularly bis 10th Case. 12

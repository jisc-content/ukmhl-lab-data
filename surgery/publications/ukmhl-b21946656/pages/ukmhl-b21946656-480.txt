461. having committed a debauch on the evening ot‘ the 8th day from his quitting the hospital, he was seized with an irresistible desire to make water; and, after some severe straining, in which he was sensible of an obstruction about the neck of the bladder, which for fully half an hour prevent- ed the passage of a single drop of urine, he shot out of the urethra with a convulsive jerk, a substance coiled up, somewhat in the shape of a fragment of a large bougie, nine lines in length, and three in breadth, the ejection of which was followed by a profuse flow of urine, passed without any muscular exertion, and succeeded by instantaneous relief. On examination of the ejected substance, it prov- ed to be two bits of cloth, consisting of his jacket and its lining, corresponding with the size of the shot-hole. The texture was unaltered, but the co- lour of the red piece was much faded ; it had neither any urinous smell, nor was any calculous concre- tion observable on it. I had an opportunity of examining this man in February 1814; the wound was perfectly cicatriz- ed, and no disorder of the urinary organs was pre- sent ; but not the slightest trace of the ball could be discovered, either by the sound, or the finger introduced into the anus. * * This ca«c has been published in the 5th 1 olume of the London Medical Repository, p. 283. The cloth is in posses- sion of my friend, Mr Thomson, one of the editors of that work. 12

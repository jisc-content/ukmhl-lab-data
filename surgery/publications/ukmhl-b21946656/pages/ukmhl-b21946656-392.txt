mass, perceptible to the eye, and to the probe, is' thrown out. A recollection of Mr Hunterâ€™s ex- periments on the transplantation of teeth, incline me to the supposition, that a tooth is the nucleus of this deposition. Pare gives a few short notices on wounds of the face, and its different parts, in his 10th book ; and Wiseman treats of them in his 5th. lla* vaton gives some instances of external injuries cured ; and Deschamps, in the 3d Vol. of the Journal de Medicine Militaire ; and Bouillard, in the 4th Vol. of the same work, give two remarkable cases : the first of a transverse sabre wound, opening the frontal sinus and lachrymal canal; the other of a longitudinal w ound, from the same weapon splitting the face from the root of' the nose to the bottom of the chin. Both those ex- tensive wounds were healed by proper bandages, and adhesive straps, without the use of sutures. Simon published at Paris, in 1765, upon the dis- eases of the tongue, in which he gives an instance of gunshot injury of it. Pibrac, in the 3d Vol. of the Memoirs of the Academy of Surgery, proposes a species of pocket bandage for the wounds of the tongue, more curious than useful. In the same Vol. Duphenix, Morand, and Louis, give some ex- cellent observations on the fistula? of the salivary canals; and in the 5th Vol. of that great work, Bordenave has given several instructive instances of injuries of these parts.

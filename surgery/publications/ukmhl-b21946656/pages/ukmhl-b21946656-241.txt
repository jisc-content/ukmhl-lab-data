Nor do the results of our hospital operations in modern practice bear any proportion to the success of those in private life, although in each we attribute a fair share in the consequences to the climate, the sea- son, and the nature of the prevalent diseases, as well as to the constitution of the individual. On those powerful causes much of the pecu- liar appearances of wounds will depend ; and in proportion as they are understood and attended to, a knowledge of the true nature of these peculiari- ties will be acquired, and much of our uncertainty in the discrimination of morbid phenomena avoid- ed. Hence, the history of particular epidemics will always be interesting. Under this convic- tion, I shall, without entering into a general de- scription of the various forms under which the disease has been observed by others, offer the re- sult of my own experience in one of the greatest scourges of military hospitals, known under the various names of Hospital Gangrene, Malignant Ulcer, Putrid Ulcer, Infectious Ulcer, Sloughing Sore, &c. * * The following account of the gangrene at Bilbao first appeared, nearly in its present form, in the Lond. Med. Repo- sitory for March 1815. An excellent summary account of the disease is given us by Professor Thomson, in his Lectures on Inflammation, p. 456. Professor Delpech of Montpelier published a still later account of hospital gangrene in 1815. But the most interesting paper that I am acquainted with, is Q

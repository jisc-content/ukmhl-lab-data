37 the opposite side, near the spine. In one, the ball entered over, and was supposed to have passed through the spleen. On dissection, it was found to have passed along the posterior part of the spleen, and lodged beside the spine, leaving: a furrow all round from its entrance to its lodgment. In one, the ball entered exactly over the spleen, and passed round to the middle of the tenth rib of the right side, furrowing the diaphragm. In two, the balls entered close to the umbilicus, and passed out exactly opposite, beside the spine. The men were supposed to have been shot through the bowels; but it was found that the balls had passed round the abdo- minal parietes, run between them and the vis- cera contained, without opening them, and passed out. In all these cases inflammation was present to a very high degree ; and, in one, gan- grene was so far advanced as to render dissection extremely offensive. A further proof of the pro- pensity of balls to take a curved direction, is often seen in cases where they strike the front of the hat, and, running round, carry off the hinder tassel*. If the ball has passed fairly through the parietes of the thorax, or abdomen, we dress both orifices, as in the first case, and take away from sixteen to twenty-four ounces of blood from the arm, if no heemorrhage has followed. We should be equally attentive td * Vide I.e Vacher, in Memoires de lâ€™Acadendade Cliiiyrgie, 'ome iv. fur some valuable observations on this subject.

The most judicious medical treatment and the ablest surgical operation will fail, if not assisted by good bandaging ; and errors in both will soon be recovered, if a proper system is adopted. 1 have seen innumerable instances of most promising stumps degenerating in a few days under an inefficient or careless dresser ; and 1 have even traced some deaths to such a cause; while rapid amendment and the saving of a limb often result from the due use of a proper system of dressing and applying the roller. Escharotics, so useful under certain circum- stances, are frequently sadly abused ; and an insensibility, or sometimes very high morbid irri- tability of parts induced by them. In simple cases of redundant or luxuriant granulations, a little scraped lint, with pressure from a compress, will be found quite sufficient for their removal; and the same will accelerate the skinning of a wound, as well as lunar caustic, or cupreous solutions : with those two last, old soldiers are well acquainted, and they should never be trusted with their use.

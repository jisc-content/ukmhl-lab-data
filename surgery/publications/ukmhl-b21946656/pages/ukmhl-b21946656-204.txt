188 When the bleeding vessel is in a state of per- fect health, and within reach, then the actual ligature is, beyond all question, the proper means of relief, lly careful dissection the vessel may be traced from the wound itself, and must be secured by a fine ligature on each orifice. If, however, as often happens, the original breach in the vessel cannot be discovered ; or if, in the prosecution of our search after it, a number of enlarged and newly formed collateral vessels are opened, and a general oozing takes place, the main trunk above its first branch in the vicinity of the wound, or at its nearest and most convenient part, should be secured. And if the operation is performed before the patient is debilitated by excessive loss of blood, and when his constitution is yet sound, and unaffected by fe- ver, which remarkably predisposes to rupture of ves- sels, or before the occurrence of gangrene, there is reasonable hope of success ; but where he is suffer- ing under disease, the vessels, whether in the wound itself, or much nearer to the heart, burst but too often under our ligatures, or ulcerate soon after their application, and leave amputation alone as our last resource, and even that resource not always to be depended on. The reducing the immoderate size of ligatures ; the separating the threads of which they were com- posed, and placing them in convenient points along the face of the stump or wounds; the actual re- moval of one half of the ligature employed in the

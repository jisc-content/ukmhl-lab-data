by gentle means, often succeeds, I he absorption is always made in irregular lines, never dividing the bone completely circularly, but giving it the appearance of being splintered ; sometimes this den- cutilation takes place all round the shaft, at others only partially ; but in all, absorption seems to have been as powerfully exerted within the canal of the bone, as on its external surface, giving both surfaces a worm-eaten or perforated appearance. I have sometimes removed a piece of bone of six or eight inches long thus eroded. The contrast be- tween it and the bone of a sound stump has been curious ; in the latter the bone is plump, exqui- sitely rounded, and the hole leading to the medul- lary canal small, and covered with a line pellicle j the cancelli beneath entire. In the other, the bone is wasted and discoloured; the sawed end flat as when the instrument was first applied ; the orifice wide, and without any membranous covering, and the cancelli destroyed. The same contrasted ap- pearances take place where there are two bones in the limb. These in the sound state of the stump are united by callus, and rounded off by the action of the absorbents. In some instances, the original diseased bone is sheathed in a new formed osseous sponge, extending considerably above its end. The luxuriant bony growth is almost peculiar to man ; in the accidental injuries of brutes it is scarcely to be seen ; and it is therefore reasonable to attribute much of its production to bandages and pressure.

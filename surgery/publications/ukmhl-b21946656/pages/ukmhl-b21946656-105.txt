89 ing this circumstance to the patient and his com- rades, an universal burst of joy echoed through the ward ; the young Hanoverian exulted in the share he conceived he had personally had of con- tributing to the downfall of the French Emperor. His health rapidly improved, and 1 have no doubt that this simple circumstance had a good effect upon every man who witnessed it. CASE. A soldier of the 52d regiment was wounded at Badajoz by a ball, which carried off his arm. He lay for some time in the breach among the heaps of his wounded comrades, the enemy keeping up an incessant fire upon them. When brought into the hospital at Elvas, several frag- ments of the bones of a cranium were taken from a lacerated wound on his thigh. CASE. A French officer of the German regiment of Nassau was wounded at the same siege; his fore-arm was dreadfully lacerated, and, gangrene supervening, it became necessary to remove the limb above the joint. In the bend of the elbow a piece of bone was found, firmly imbedded, which, on examination, proved to be part of an ulna and olecranon of another person that had been driven in by the ball.

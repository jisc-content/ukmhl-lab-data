No relief followed the evacuation of this ; and the tumour of the brain went on increasing in size, and with strong pulsation on the surface, but with great de- pression, fluttering, and intermission in the pulse at the wrist, till it. burst on the third day after its discovery, discharging a quantity of fluid during the night. The succeeding day he was attacked with tenesmus and occasional vomiting, and some of the cerebral substance was discharged by the wound. The day following the senses wrere much impaired, and he became delirious. The stools were now involuntary, and the brain continued to be discharged at the wound. He got progressively worse; his mouth became distorted towards the right, (on which side he was wounded ;) his coun- tenance was expressive of deep anguish ; the dis- charge of the brain increased ; and he expired in strong convulsions on the morning of the 23d August, the ninety-eighth day from the injury.

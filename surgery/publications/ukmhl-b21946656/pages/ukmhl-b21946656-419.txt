Some few days after a tumour arising about the wound, I gave him a visit, and felt the swelled part crackle under my fingers. Concluding it wind got out from the cavity within the thorax, I made an incision into the swelling about au inch long, by which the wind was discharged.” In the case of effusion of air into one side of the thorax, or into one sac of the pleura, the quantity must depend upon the greater or less adhesion of the wounded lungs to the costal surface,—a cir- cumstance which is so frequent as to be scarcely looked upon as morbid ; and in whatever propor- tion the effusion may be, the wounded lung is in- capable of perfectly performing its functions ; did it dilate and contract by the inhalation and expira- tion of air, it never could heal at all.

180 most able surgeons, I select the following example, of great interest and high value in a practical point of view. CASE. A middle aged man was brought into one of the hospitals of the capital, for a compound frac- ture of the left tibia, unaccompanied either by ex- tensive laceration or contusion. He was placed under the charge of an excellent assistant, and the limb, for some weeks, seemed to be doing well, when suddenly hemorrhage came on during dres- sing, the assistant at the bed-side, and the surgeon of the hospital expected every moment. He lost about 20 ounces of blood before the artery at the groin was effectually compressed, and the tourni- quet applied. The most diligent search coidd not detect the bleeding vessel. Amputation was there- fore bad recourse to. On examination of the ar- teries, it was some time before the branch from which the hemorrhage had proceeded could be dis- covered. It at last was found to be the anterior ti- bial, and the orifice in it was so minute, as with difficulty to admit three hogs bristles. In another case, with which I have been favour- ed by Dr Thomson, a fatal secondary hemorrhage occurred about the 80th day after a pistol shot in the upper part of the thigh, w here no trace of the wound of an artery could be detected, even by the aid of injection of the diseased limb. li

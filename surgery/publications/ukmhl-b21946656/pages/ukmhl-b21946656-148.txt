132 similar situation, and in the course of my exami- nation of several amputated limbs removed from incurable compound fractures, 1 have discovered, that, notwithstanding every eare both in dres- sing and position, a piece or pieces of bone, including the whole cylinder, not displaced from their position, (and therefore not to be remedied or suspected,) but with the periosteum injured or destroyed, had formed an invincible barrier to the junction of the living extremities of the bone, between which they have been interposed. When those dead pieces of bone are small and only partially detached, the vessels pour forth that matter which is afterwards, by a pe- culiar process of Nature, to become osseous; and those pieces are enveloped in the new bony case, and are placed exactly in the same situa- tion as the sequestra in cases of necrosis, from different causes. We have not the same means in our power to excite the ossific action in compound fractures as in that of the simple kind ; irritation of va- rious sorts, pressure, friction, external stimulants to the skin, or even the operation of the seton, as practised by Mr. Rowlands*, which have been successfully had recourse to in the indolent state of the latter, are inadmissible in the former ; * Vide Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. ii. p. 47; and vol. v. p.

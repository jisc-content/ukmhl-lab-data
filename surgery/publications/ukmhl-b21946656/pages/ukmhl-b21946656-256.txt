240 unces would at all warrant us a priori in conclud- ing, as we often found a diseased track running up into the groin or axilla, and completely dissecting the muscles and great vessels. This was, indeed, sometimes obvious during life, for on the casting off the sloughs, the muscles would appear as perfectly disengaged as the most accurate knife could ren- der them, at the same time they would, for a long period, retain their florid colour and preserve their action. In very violent cases, however, the mus- cles partook of the disease, and either sloughed off* in successive layers, or became converted into a flabby disorganized mass. The thoracic and abdominal viscera did not ap- pear to suffer peculiarly while the gangrene occupied the extremities ; but where the ribs or abdominal parietes have been the seat of disease, I have oc- casionally observed that the viscus, which corre- sponded in situation with the external sore, took on a diseased appearance. I have seen the lungs in two cases, and the pericardium in a third, co- vered with gangrenous spots ; and I have often observed the same appearance on the liver j but I have never traced any thing of the kind on the membranes of the brain. The bones, in some instances, resisted the con- tagion for a long time, either exhibiting no mor- bid appearance whatever, or barely throwing off' a thin scale. In other cases, however, particularly where the ribs, sternum, or cranium were denuded,

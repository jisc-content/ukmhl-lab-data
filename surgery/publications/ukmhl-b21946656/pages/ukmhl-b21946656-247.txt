231 wards, and divisions, opened ventilators, removed nuisances both within and without, and enforced the most rigid attention to personal cleanliness, and to the frequent renewal and airing of the bedding. I had a most striking instance, within my own experience, of what attention to these points can effect in the way of prevention ; for, at the general hospital at Elvas, of which I was principal me- dical officer during the whole period of the success- ful operation before Badajos in 1812, although 2500 wounded were treated there, yet not a single instance, either of hospital gangrene or typhus fe- ver, appeared among them, although both these diseases had raged with unexampled fury the two preceding years. This happy result I attributed to cleanliness and ventilation, and to the removal of an enormous dunghill, the lower stratum of which was formed of the semi-putrid tow, and bloody bandages left after the battle of Talavera j and which, on being turned up, was incrusted with the same kind of fungus mentioned by the older French surgeons, as appearing on the dressings at the Hotel Dieu. * The smell emitted, while re- moving this decomposing mass, was almost insup- portable ; and, together with the effluvia from two stagnant ponds, which I caused to be drained, * These fungi are very rapid in their growth, springing up in one night. Their species, I believe, is not determined, lhey were supposed to exist only on bandages moistened with oxycrate ; but they are by no means confined to them.

The young surgeon, who for the first time witnesses a series of injuries of this description, will at every step have something to unlearn ; he will find symptoms so complicated, contradictory, and insufficient to give any rational clue to their causes; diagnostics, of the truth of which he had read himself into a conviction, so totally unsupport- ed by the results of practice ; and the sympathies he was led to look for as infallible accompaniments of certain states of disease so often altogether want- ing ; that he will probably be inclined to relinquish the hope of ever arriving at a correct theory, or, at least, he will enter the clinical ward with the pride of science considerably subdued. I offer the few following observations, merely as illustra- tive of some leading points of the general doctrine in a class of injuries, exceeded by none in the ex- tensive range of the profession for interest and im- portance, and on which volumes might be composed without exhausting the subject, or fully elucidating it.

To effect this desirable object, nothing should

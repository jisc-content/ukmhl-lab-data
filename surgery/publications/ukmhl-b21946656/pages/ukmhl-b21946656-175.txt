169 * Mr Hunter gives us the case of a man, C. D. who was shot through the joint of the knee ; the ball entered at the outer edge of the patella, cross- ed through the joint under that bone, and came out through the inner condyle of the os femoris. This man, and four others, had nothing done to their wounds for four days after receiving them, having secreted themselves in a farm-house, and when brought to the hospital, the wounds were only dressed superficially, and they all got well. Had this man been placed in a waggon or on horse- back, and carried for some miles to an hospital, with his usual allowance of food, would the result have been the same ? I confidently answer. No. Nothing but quiet and abstinence could have pro- duced such an exemption from inflammation $ and even with those circumstances in his favour, the case is one of a thousand. In my own practice, I have met with only twro cases where the limb was saved after a serious injury of the knee-joint, t and in one of them only was the perfect use of it restored. I never met with an instance where the ankle or elbow-joint was perfectly restored after severe injury, though some where the limb has * Treatise on the Blood, Inflammation, and Gunshot Wounds, London, 1812, Vul. II. p. 438. t The head of the fibula is in some favourable cases the part alone injured, and it has in some of those instances been re- moved without any further operation, and, of course, without implicating the joint directly ; even this, however, is by no means a frequent occurrence.

In doing this, the limb should be relaxed, and put into a position favourable to the gravitation of the ball, &c. towards the surface, if it can be be done without much pain ; and, if no serious inconvenience follow's, the patient may be placed, as recommended by all the older surgeons, in the position in which he received the injury ; but in many cases this is impracticable, and in none indispensable, although the practitioners of former days attached such value to it, that in some instances, if the wounded man happened unfortunately to be a trooper, they placed him on horseback to facilitate the extraction* of the inflicting body ! Fully to answer every purpose expected from this plan, not only the posture of the wounded man, but that of his assailant, should be determined. The Surgeon should never omit a moderate search after extraneous bodies at every dressiug, ^ Vide Gesuer’a “ ObservaL de Chirurgiee dignitate et prasstautia,” as quoted by Wiseman, p, 324.

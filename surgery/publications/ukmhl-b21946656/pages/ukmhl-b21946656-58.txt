42 infinitely counterbalanced the benefit derived from saving it. An instance has come to my knowledge, hi which an eminent army surgeon recommended amputation for a case of this description. Un- fortunately for the patient, he listened to the hopes held out to him of saving the limb by other practitioners. After a tedious confinement and much misery, the limb remained appended to liis body; but, at the end of thirty years, he solicited his original adviser to remove the part, which was accordingly done to his great relief. in civil society, where the patient has always led a temperate, quiet life, and the injury has been inflicted perhaps bv a clean cutting instru- ment, or a small ball has passed near or par- tially injured the joint (a case so very different from that occasioned by a large shot passing into or near a joint, where the patient has to be dragged over heavy roads, in bad carriages, with- out surgical aid or medical comforts), 1 know that cures have been ellected ; and even in mili- tary life there are instances to be found ot the same kind. 1 would still, however, lay it down as a law of military surgery, that no lacerated joint, particularly the knee, ankle, or elbow, should ever Icare the held imamputated, where the patient is not obviously sinking, and conse- quently where certain death would follow the operation.

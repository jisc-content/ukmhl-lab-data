The point is incontrovertibly settled ; the vessel can be compressed as it runs over the first rib with the greatest certainty, and, by an expert assistant, with the utmost ease. I have performed the opera- tion seven times,—twice out of the number by can- dle light; I have been the compressor of the artery repeatedly; and I have been witness to its being commanded on numerous occasions; but I have ne- ver seen the most remote approach to dangerous hemorrhage. * When a large majority of the Bri- tish hospital staff* operated in concert for several successive days at Vittoria, the loss of a wine glass- ful of arterial blood, when this operation has been performed, has been an unusual occurrence ; much oftener half the quantity ; and in one amputation performed upon an heroic soldier of the Chasseurs Britanniques by Staff-surgeon Uease, assisted by Staff-surgeon M‘Lean and myself, the amount of arterial blood lost from the principal artery, was * I have not the least objection to the counter security of pressure in the axilla; but if the patient is properly supported in a chair, or laid along on a table, which I much prefer, his yielding to the pressure over the rib is completely prevented.

187 Where a ball has passed close to, or lodges near or upon a principal blood-vessel, the utmost cau- tion as to excess of every kind is to be most rigidly observed ; and more particularly when the sloughs begin to separate, and the eschars from the arterial coats may be naturally supposed to loosen. And here I must entreat the young army sur- geon not to allow himself to be lulled into a fa- tal security, hy a supposition, that secondary bleed- ings from gunshot wounds are but of imaginary im- portance, and of rare occurrence. The supposition is absolutely erroneous. Experience shows, that from the 5th to the 11th days are in general the critical periods to be watched. Dr Thomson, with that accuracy and discrimination which characterize his writ- ings, divides secondary hemorrhage into three species, taking place at three distinct periods; hemorrhage from increased determination of blood occurring from the 1st to the 5th day ; hemor- rhage from sloughing of the arterial coats from con- tusion from the 5th to the 10th ; hemorrhage from ulceration of the coats of the vessels from and after the 10th to any distant period. To these the Doctor adds, what he appropriately compares to the spon- taneous hemorrhage from capillary vessels opening on mucous surfaces ; a species peculiarly connect- ed with excesses. * * Report of Observations made in the British Military Hos- pitals in lielgium.

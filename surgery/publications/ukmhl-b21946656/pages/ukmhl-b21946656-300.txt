The great violence of the injury itself which requires the operation, and the severe shock, are quite sufficient to account for the fatal events. In much less serious operations than that of hip- joint amputation, I have seen death occur on the moment, and that in men of the most determined courage, and without the smallest excess of hemor- rhage. Upon the whole, I believe that we may as safely divest ourselves of all fears of hemorrhage in operations properly conducted on the lower ex- tremities, as we now do on the upper. An ingenious naval surgeon, Mr Veitch, has published a paper upon this operation, in which he proposes to make the first step of it in no re- spect different from the high circular one, except by leaving an inch or two of the bone projecting, which may be done without the slightest pain or trouble, by dissecting off the soft parts towards the knee, and sawing the bone low down. This projecting piece of bone, he proposes to use as a sort of lever, to assist in the complete dislocation of the head from the acetabulum, which he next proceeds to do, and which is certainly much acce- lerated by the removal of the unwieldy mass of limb, which was all but separated before the ap- plication of the saw7. # Were I called upon to per- form the operation, I should certainly proceed * Edinburgh Mpo. and Surg- Journal, VoJ.

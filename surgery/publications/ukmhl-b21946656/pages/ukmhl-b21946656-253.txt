While the acute symptoms, as above described, were proceeding in one part of the hospital, the same appearance began to spread through another at a distance ; for immediate contact, though high- ly dangerous, was by no means necessary toward the propagation of this most insidious disease. The stumps which had been nearly healed caught the morbid disposition ; those where healing by the first intention was reasonably to be looked for, opened, retorted their edges, put on .an erysipela- tous appearance, and, at last bursting up altogether, presented a frightful cup-like excavation, edged with the true characteristic circular lip.

201 observed. “ Quo die quis inungit telum, (says Croliius, describing the rules to be observed on this occasion,) abstineat a venere l” Hemorrhage from blows on the face of stumps are very frequent ; and many officers, who have boasted of an early cure, are in a worse situation at the end of three months, from exposing them- selves to accidents, than those who have been con- fined to their chambers for the whole period. The great vascularity observable about the ends of stumps which have been injected after death, will sufficiently account for this ; and the inexpertness in the use of crutches, and the want of balance and support, which the removal of the principal part of an extremity occasions, will naturally pro- duce numerous accidents. In these distressing cases, rest, moderation in diet, acidulated drinks, and the local application of cold, are the most useful remedies. One more species of hemorrhage, but fortunate- ly not a very frequent one, is produced by the secondary opening of an arterial branch in the parts concerned in compound fractures. No de- fined period can be assigned to the accident, nor is there any peculiarity in the mode of cure. I have already given a case of this nature, in which no cause could be assigned ; in some instances, it is occasioned by spiculte of bone opening the vessel.

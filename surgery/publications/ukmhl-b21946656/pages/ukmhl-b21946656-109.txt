93 smooth leaden balls are particularly apt to do, without giving pain, they ought never to be re- moved ; when they come from their lurking places, and present at the skin, or near the surface, the extraction becomes a matter of great simplicity. Except the ball or other foreign matter is completely in our power, we should never use the knife to enlarge the wound, or promise a cer- tain extraction, however urgent the patient may be ; for as nothing is more cheering than pre- senting him with the ball, so nothing is more disheartening, or tends more to shake his con- fidence in his medical attendants, than a disap- pointment under those circumstances. Some useful information may be drawn from the appearance of the ball, as to the nature of the matter carried in by it, or of the injury it may have inflicted upon the bone. Shreds of cloth, the metallic particles of an epaulet, a piece of lace, of breast-plate, or other ornament, are fre- quently found solidly imbedded in it; and these appearances may lead us to a more certain know- needle in the left arm of a woman, discharged at the right breast, by Dr. Lysons of Gloucester. A case is given by Gasparetti, in his “ Ozzervazioni,” of a piece of glass, after nine years, shifting from one hand to the other: and numerous in- stances of articles swallowed, and passing out by the muscles, bladder, vagina, neck, and region of the liver, may be found in Valisneri Opera, tom. i. p. 360 ; and by Silvy in Memoires de la Societe Medicale d’Emulation, An. 5, p. 181.

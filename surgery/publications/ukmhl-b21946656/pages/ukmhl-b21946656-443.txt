427 or rubbed by the finger, communicated a friable earthy sensation. The whole of the tubercles were uniformly hard and dense, and no tendency to suppuration could be discovered in any of them. Incisions into the substance of the different lobes of both lungs were immediately followed by an oozing of mucus from the bronchia?, but no collec- tion of matter, or any mark of recent inflammation, could be discovered. The trachea, particularly the lower part of it, and the larger branches of the bronchia, were literally filled with a glairy tena- cious mucus; the capsule of the heart contained about eight ounces of serum, of the natural colour and consistence ; the heart was perfectly sound, but remarkably small, and the parietes of the left ventricle were three-fourths of an inch in thick- ness ; the outer side of the left ventricle adhered firmly to the pericardium ; the adhesion was of a circular form, and was about one inch and a quarter in diameter ; the aorta ascendens was pre- ternaturally hard and dense, but no actual ossifica- tion had taken place. A sense of stricture in the chest, and consider- able pain on raising the body to an erect posture, with great anxiety on walking up an ascent, are very frequent consequences of wounds of the thorax after their cure ; and, in two cases lately under my charge, great depression of spirits, and a very impaired state of the digestive organs, fol- lowed wounds in which the intercostal nervous branches were implicated.

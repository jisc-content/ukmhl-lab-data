On examination, it was found to be lodged in the posterior part of the fauces, forming a tumour be- hind and nearly in contact with the velum pendulum. It had passed in at the internal canthus of the eye, fracturing the bone ; and, although blindness was the instant consequence, the globe of the eye was not destroyed ; and the remaining cicatrix and very inflamed state of the organ were the only proofs that an extraneous body had passed near it. Balls occasionally take their course through the superciliary ridge, and often penetrate through the lower part of the orbitar process, and go out under the zygomatic arch, or lodge in the antrum of Highmore, or in the nares ; or, Anally, pass out through the palate and into the mouth, or exter- nally at the throat. Of this kind seems to have been a case which made a great noise many year’s ago, and obtained insertion in the Philosophical Transactions. The ball entered by the right orbit, and passed inwards. After a variety of exfoliations from the wound, nose, and mouth, and the forma- tion of several tumours about the jaw, it was at last cut out (after thirty years’ residence in the parts)

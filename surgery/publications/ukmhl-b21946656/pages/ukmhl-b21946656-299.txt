283 myself, on two late occasions, performed amputa- tion of the thigh so very high up, nearly embrac- ing the trochanter, and consequently the capsular ligament of the joint, that a very few strokes of the scalpel would have effected the dislocation ; more especially, if the head and neck of the bone had been split to pieces, as it very often is. My incision was the common circular one ; and I did not, as I once before had done, make the taking up of the femoral artery a necessary preliminary measure; I tied the arteries in succession as they were cut, an able assistant pressing on that in the groin. In the last, I was favoured by the assist- ance of these excellent surgeons, Messrs Guthrie and Brownrigg, and the hemorrhage was not at all greater than when the tourniquet is applied higher up. In Mr Guthrieâ€™s hip-joint case, at Brussels, Staff-surgeon Collier and myself com- pressed the vessels, and the hemorrhage was very little more than in the common amputation with a tourniquet ; indeed, the state of the vessels pre- sented nothing difficult to the operator, whose coolness and dexterity were unrivalled. In a hip-joint case operated upon by Mr Vance at Haslar, after a method analogous to the flap opera- tion at the shoulder-joint, now so generally adopt- ed, the loss of blood was altogether trifling ; the greatest flow was from the separated limb ; and, al- though the patient died some time afterwards, his death was totally unconnected with hemorrhage. Indeed, the deaths, as far as my inquiries have

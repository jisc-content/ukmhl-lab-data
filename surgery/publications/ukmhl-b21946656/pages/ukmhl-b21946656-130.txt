114 £‘ copious suppuration was found to have taken “ place on the 29th, with an abatement of pain, “ and the ball was easily felt, but immoveable, “ and seemingly stuck in the bone. Poultices “ and fomentations were now' applied ; and on “ the 1st of October, I found he had had another “ shivering fit the preceding night, and that a “ piece of cloth had come away w ith the dis- “ charge, which was much increased. This “ evening he was attacked with diarrhoea, and “ vomited some bilious matter; the suppuration “ now became profuse, the diarrhoea grew pro- “ gressively worse, and his rigors continued to “ return with an exhausting purulent discharge “ until the 7th, when amputation was again pro- “ posed, as the only means of preventing a ra- “ pidly fatal termination ; but he persevered in “ his resolution to prefer death to this operation. “ As the only alternative, I extensively dilated “ the wound down to the bone, when the ball “ was found fixed in the centre of the external “ condyle of the femur, nearly a quarter of an “ inch below the bony surface. The crown of a “ trephine was now applied, and a flattened ball “ was extracted, writh several portions of cloth. “ Light dressing was applied, and next morn- “ ing it was found he had escaped his shivering “ fit; his diarrhoea was abated, and he had en- “ joyed sleep ; which, since the first day of his “ wound, had beeu nearly a stranger to him.

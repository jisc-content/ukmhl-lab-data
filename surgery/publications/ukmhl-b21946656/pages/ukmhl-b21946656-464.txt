448 the poor wretch to die in peace without searching after effused fluids, the nature of which cannot be known, or, if known, the information cannot in the most remote degree lead to recovery. I have never witnessed a case where any possible good ef- fects could follow the paracentesis, for peritonitis in its most exquisite form has always preceded the symptoms which would lead to the perform- ance of that operation; I by no means, however, would deny the possibility of the occurrence of effu- sion, and its relief in this way ; for from Vacher, Petit, and other good authorities, we know it has happened ; but in the military hospitals, to which I have had access, it has been invariably fatal. For much of our knowledge on abdominal in- juries, we are unquestionably indebted to the va- luable observations of Hevin, Petit, and other writers in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Surgery of Paris, (which it is to be feared have not been referred to with the same freedom that they have been made use of,) to the “ Mede- cine Operatoire” of Sabatier, and to the unri- valled Memoir of Scarpa, now rendered familiar by the publication of it by Wishart in an English translation. * To Mr Travers t we owe a very learned and laborious work on the subject, in which he confirms the experiments of Professor * Scarpa on Hernia, Edinb. 1814, Memoir 4th. + An Inquiry into the process of nature, in repairing in- juries of the intestines.

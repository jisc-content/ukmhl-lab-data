little circle of silk lias lain quietly at the shrunk li- gamentous-like extremity of the artery in a small cyst, formed by a thickened cellular membrane; but its more common fate is to be discharged with the dressings. The campaign of Waterloo furnish- ed me with many additional proofs of the excel- lence of this plan, and whatever may be the inten- tion, whether to heal the wound or not, I now never hesitate about cutting short the ends of the ligatures. A single thread, well waxed, (or at most two,) is quite sufficient for any ligature ; the artery should be well drawn out from its sheath, and the ligature placed as high as possible. The natural re- traction of the vessel will in most instances carry it out of sight, and unless gangrene or excessive sloughing take place, it will frequently never more be heard of, and I verily believe never will do harm. Mr Guthrie, in his work on Amputation, makes an objection to the short cut ligatures j and as every suggestion of his is entitled to the utmost at- tention, I shall state his observations, which, upon the whole, are favourable to the mode I recom- mend, and then very briefly remark upon them, as far as my experience authorizes me to do. At page 93 he observes, â€œ I know that many cases treated in this manner in the campaign of IS 13 ended suc- cessfully, and healed in as short a time as the most favourable ones by the usual method ; and at Mont- pelier in June 18H', M.

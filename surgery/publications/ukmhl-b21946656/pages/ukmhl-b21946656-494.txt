478 repeated, which brought off some clots, with a little green-coloured feculent matter. The fo- mentation was continued, and a dose of castor oil administered, which, before evening, procured three easy, copious, feculent motions, the last of which was a little tinged with blood. At the evening visit his pulse was 87, soft and regular ; he was free from pain, breathed easily, and complained only of thirst. A slight return of pain in the shoulder, and soreness over the hypochondrium, obliged me the following morning to take away 12 ounces of blood, and from this time he went on in- variably well, and commenced the campaign of 1813 in good health. In this case the ball appears to have passed along the inner surface of the chest without injuring the lungs, and to have entered the abdomen, where it injured a portion of the intes- tine and implicated part of the liver. * I have never known a patient recover after a wround of the Gall-Bladder, and, indeed, it is difficult to imagine a case where it could happen without an effusion of bile into the abdominal cavity, except a previous adhesion had taken place to the parietes ; a case, however, is mentioned in the “ Opuscules de Chirurgie” of Paroisse, p. 255, where a leaden * Loesecke, in his Observationes Anatomic.

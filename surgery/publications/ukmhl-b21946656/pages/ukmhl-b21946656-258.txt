moral artery, immediately under the ligament, and then cutting as deep an inverted cone as I possi- bly could, I sawed off the bone immediately be- low the trochanter. On examining the amputated portion of the limb, the whole mass, with the ex- ception of the skin, was found to be cartilaginous, retaining the shape of an enlarged bone, but not the smallest trace of osseous matter. The tube of thickened periosteum in which it lay, alone exhi- bited a few detached specks of ossification. The operation succeeded, and the patient embarked in six weeks. The blood-vessels were affected as variously as the bones. In some rare cases, I have seen the femo- ral and axillary arteries pulsating awfully, and ap- parently unaffected with disease ; while all the sur- rounding parts were completely destroyed. But in a vast majority of cases the blood-vessels partook of the general disease in which they were imbedded. They were not only completely separated from their na- tural connections, but their coats sloughed away at the immediate point of disease, while the disposi- tion extended far beyond the apparently affected spot. Hence, our ligatures but too often failed on the main branches, and any attempt on the smaller was invariably injurious. We were here natu- rally induced to tie the artery considerably above the seat of the disease ; and this was done, once on the femoral, and twice on the axillary artery; the former burst on the third, each of the latter

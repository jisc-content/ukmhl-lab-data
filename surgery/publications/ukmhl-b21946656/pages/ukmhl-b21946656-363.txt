347 The mildest dressings, the cautious employ- ment of pressure, the supporting the parts as much as possible by the approximation of the edges of the scalp, and avoiding every species of stimu- lus, are the means that I would recommend in these cases, in which, independent of the protru- sion, there is often a serious injury of the entire mass of the cerebrum. Some surgeons have ven- tured on the use of escharotics; but I have always seen their employment succeeded by a great aggra- vation of the symptoms. They have been employ- ed to a greater extent by the late Mr Hill of Dum- fries than perhaps by any other British surgeon ; his experience on this subject will be found well worth consulting, and is to be met with in his “ Cases in Surgery.” Mr Abernethy has thrown a brilliant and steady light upon this, as he has done upon every subject which he has enlarged on. An inte- resting paper by Crell, and another by Sand, “ De Fungo Cerebri,” is to be met with in the 1st vol. of the “ Disputationes Chirurgicze of Haller,” and an inaugural dissertation of great merit has recently been published by Dr Abraham Solomons, “ De Cerebri Tumoribus,” Edinburgh, 1810. But per- haps the greatest mass of information that has ever been collected upon the point, is to be found in the admirable memoir of M. Louis, “ Sur les Tu- meurs fongueuses de la Dure Mere,” in the 5th vol. of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Surgery.

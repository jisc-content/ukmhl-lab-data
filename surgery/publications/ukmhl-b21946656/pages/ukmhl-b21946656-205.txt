I allude to the plan of removing the ends of the ligature al- together, and thus leaving to an extensive wound the greatest possible chance of immediate union. No doubt, we could be furnished with a vast mass of recollections upon this subject, and enabled to collect materials for the history of short cut li- gatures, from “ post facto” contributions ; but, in the mean time, I shall state my own experience on the subject, and while I take to myself the merit of having been the first British army surgeon who followed the practice, and circulated the account of it, I disclaim all pretensions to originality. The * For this very serious improvement in ligatures, we are, I believe, obliged to a naval surgeon, James Yeitch, Esq. late of the Naval Hospital, Plymouth, who, in a modest and convincing paper, published in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, Vol. II. p. 176, under the title “ The In- quirer,” and with the assumed signature of J.

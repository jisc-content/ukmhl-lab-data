152 But even of this favourable variety I have seen only two cases cured, both of persons struck on the centre of the femur, the wound admitting a finger to be passed into the bony ring, or perforation, and there to find a clear, unembarrassed and simple loss of parts. By far the most frequent result is the loss of the limb sooner or later, after a very tedious and distressing train of symptoms, wearying to the patient, and baffling every endeavour of his attendants. On examination, we find bony frag- ments lying beyond the reach of operation, ei- ther in a parallel direction in the cavity of the bone, or fairly wedged across it, the medulla de- stroyed, the cancelli absorbed, and, if the posture of the limb admits of it, the fragments falling down deeper into the canal, as the bony network is re- moved. To obviate these mechanical injuries, na- ture makes many inefficient efforts, and throws out large shapeless bony masses, which either enve- lope the diseased parts completely, or else so em- barrass and partially fill up the orifices of the wound in the bone, as to render the extraction of frag- ments, or even their detection, next to impossible. The attempts of nature to remedy this state are often continued so far as to form orifices, or Cloaca*, in this newly formed bone, for the discharge oi the fragments. In some cases, the parts of the original bone which formed the sides of the ring, and kept the limb in its natural position, and at its due extent, are entirely absorbed ; little or nothing

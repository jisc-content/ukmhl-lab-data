SGI directly forward into the orbit, as this did. I felt under the zygoma and all along the neighbour- hood of this poor fellow’s wound, but in the puffy state of the parts could not detect the course of the ball. He himself was confident it had gone into his brain. He returned to France convales- cent. Garangeot (Traite des Operations, Vol. III. Obs. 20.) gives us an interesting case from the lectures of Petit, in which a soldier received a wound towards the great angle of the eye. It was deemed but of little consequence, and healed under the common hospital treatment. The man expressed a wish to leave the hospital, although cautioned by the surgeon, and had scarcely reach- ed the door, when he was seized with rigors, oblig- ed to return, and died in two days. On dissec- tion, the ball was found lodged under the sphe- noid cells and the hole of the optic nerve. The effect on this man’s sight is not mentioned. In some cases the ball passes into the orbit without bursting the eye-ball, although the power of vision is totally lost. Of this I had a case at Elvas, which occurred during the siege of Ba- dajoz. It struck me at the time, as illustrative of the mode in which, by the resilience of their coats distended with fluid, the blood-vessels often escape injury when balls pass close to them. A soldier of the 52d regiment was brought into the operation room at Elvas, some weeks after being

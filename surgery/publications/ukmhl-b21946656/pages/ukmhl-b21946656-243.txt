Stream, the Ibaicabal, which runs through a fertile valley, gradually opening from the town of Bilbao to the Bay of Biscay. Its waters, which rise in the lofty mountains that bound Alava and Biscay, are strongly impregnated with iron, and teem with wholesome fish. The tide in the vicinity of the hospital rose between six and seven feet, and extended its influence about four miles up the stream. The soil in the immediate vicinity of the hos- pital was dry and gravelly j shelving gradually from the water, until, at the distance of a mile, a lofty ridge of mountains rose behind, and perfectly screened it from the winds. These mountains, Jthe highest of which is said to be, by barometrical observation, about 1400 feet above the level of the sea, abound in iron. On the opposite bank of the river, a chain of hills stretch along at the distance of half a mile, leaving between their base and the water a fertile and well drained flat.

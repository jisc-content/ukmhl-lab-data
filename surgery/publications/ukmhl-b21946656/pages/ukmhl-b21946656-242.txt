226 On Hospital Gangrene as it appeared in some of the Establishments in Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands. The military events on the Peninsula during the month of July 1813, in which the action of Vittoria was fought, rendered it necessary to form several hospital stations in the provinces of Alava, St Andero, and Biscay. Among these, Bilbao was selected as capable of accommodating a large num- ber of sick and wounded, as being easy of access, and remarkable for its salubrity. The principal hospitals were distant about four miles from the town, and six from the sea. They consisted of a noble convent, which was occupied chiefly by medical cases ; and of the upper floor of a very extensive building, formerly a rope-walk belonging to the Spanish government, which was exclusively allotted to the reception of surgical cases, and placed under my care. The Cordeleria, or Rope-walk Hospital, was built on the southern bank of a small but rapid one by Professor Brugmans of Leyden, in the “ Annales de Litterature Medicale, Etrangere et Nationale,” for July 1815. The 106th and 107th numbers of that work, or the first two of the 19th Volume.

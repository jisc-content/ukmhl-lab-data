and the flaps brought together with adhesive straps and bandage. This I have found the easiest and simplest mode of performing the amputation, al- though the dexterity of many of my brother sur- geons in the Peninsula and on the Continent was so great, that almost every individual had a pecu- liar plan, and they finished their operations in as short a space of time as they would have required to describe the differences of their plans from those of others. * In whatever form we may be disposed to make our flap, we must be guided by the state of the soft parts. If, as very often happens, a round shot has grazed along the top and external parts of the shoulder, laying open the joint, there the flap, by laying back the deltoid, cannot possibly be made. If a musket ball, or a piece of shell has struck the centre of that muscle and penetrated to the joint, or comminuted the head and neck of the bone, it would be highly imprudent to make a flap of a wounded muscle, ever liable to sloughing. If the shot-holes are lateral, our semilunar incision may be so contrived as to pass through them and re- move all lacerated parts ; but if it cannot be so managed, and that they must necessarily remain in one or both our flaps, we must, with the finger and sponge, clear away all splinters, (with which * Tliis plan may also be advantageously adopted where w e mean only to remove the head ot the bone.

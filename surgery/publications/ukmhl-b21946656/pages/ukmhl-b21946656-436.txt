Injuries of a most serious nature are inflicted by wounds in the upper and back part of the tho- rax without entering its cavity; but which pro- duce dreadful laceration of the muscles, splintered fractures of the clavicles and scapula, and profuse hemorrhage from the arteries running along those bones. The injuries of the scapula itself are not of a very serious nature. Balls make a clean passage through its broad plate, and the splinters occa- sioned by them are easily removed ; nor are the simple fractures of the clavicle of great conse- quence abstractedly; but I have seen some of the most tremendous wounds in which they have been implicated, and the inflammation and sloughing disposition spreading from them to the thoracic vis- cera and to the shoulder-joint, have been produc- tive of protracted tortures to the sufferer, rendering life a very dubious blessing indeed. * The imme- diate preservation of existence has, in the fortunate cases, certainly depended on the profuse loss of blood ; and the antiphlogistic regimen, with the utmost simplicity of dressing, has perfected the re- covery. * A very remarkable case is noticed in the Edin.

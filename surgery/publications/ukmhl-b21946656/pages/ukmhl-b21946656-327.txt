In the works of some of the older authors, we meet with cases where epilepsy and various other bad symptoms have followed the attempts at extracting arrows and other missiles sticking in the brain. A mo- dern surgeon would be severely and justly censured for not at least making a trial ; but we are encou- raged to look for. the eventual safety of our pa- tients, when the course or actual site of the ball or other body is unknown, by recorded and well-au- thenticated instances of life being preserved, when they either have not been looked after, or their ex- istence has not been suspected. The records of surgery furnish us with many proofs of metallic and other bodies lying for long periods between the cranium and dura mater ; but experience shows, that the extraneous bodies may lie even in the brain itself without producing death. * I have seen no less than five cases where a ball has lodged in the substance of the cerebrum, without immediately producing a fatal event.

The catalogue might be very easily enlarged, and may be seen at great length in the references of Ploucquet, in his learned and laborious “ Literatura Medica Digesta,” &c, Tubingen, I8O9.

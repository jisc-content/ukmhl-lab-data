It is not, however, one generally adopted ; I have never seen it performed on the field; and in hospital practice I have onlyseenone case of it. The frequency of its removal by M. Larrey and Mr. Guthrie should encourage us to hold the plan in view*; but 1 have not enlarged upon it as a field operation ; its seriousness, the comparative rarity of the cases requiring it, and its doubtful utility, rendering it a subject for consultation in the hospital, and one not to be lightly treated of from theory alone, or from a few successful cases. If the bone is much splin- tered, and particularly if its periosteum, for any extent towards the condyle, is injured, we have no means to guide us to the probable boundaries of inflammation or death of the bone; and a perfect amputation may become necessary, from those events, after the head of the bone has been removed. If the ball has only struck, fractured, or otherwise injured the head of the bone, with- out exlensive laceration of the capsular ligament, injury to the great vessels or nerves, &c. &c. the surgeon would be utterly unjustifiable, either in the amputation of the limb on the field by a * Vide Park on Carious Joints; Guthrie on Gun-shot Wounds of the Extremities, p. 113, London, 1815.

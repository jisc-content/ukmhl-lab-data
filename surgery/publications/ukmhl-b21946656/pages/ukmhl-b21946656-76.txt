60 A great aid to the cleanliness of an hospital, is the selection of a proper apartment or gallery, in the vicinity of the kitchen, for the purpose of messing; or tents may be employed for the same purpose : indeed, a supply of those articles is of the most serious import in an hospital, as all cases of fever or infectious disease, or those peculiarly requiring seclusion, may be promptly and effectual- ly removed into them from the wards. Whatever may be the extent of our accom- modation, it ought to be formed into three grand divisions, which may be larger or smaller as cir- cumstances demand ; viz. the surgical, the me- dical, and the convalescent branches; the two latter, of course, will not be so urgently wanted, immediately after an action or series of field move- ments, as the first; but they should be held in view, as ultimately of great consequence towards the safe conduct of the medical part of the cam- paign. 1 would recommend it also, as a general rule, never to open several hospitals for the reception of the wounded at the same time, although we should always have them ready prepared for a general improvement of the wounds and ulcers take place in the military hospitals after a supply of boards and tres- sels, or other means of elevating the beds from the floors; the same has been observed on board the Hospital Ship, on the coast of Egypt, by my friend Dr Dickson ol Clifton, in pa- tients elevated above the decks.

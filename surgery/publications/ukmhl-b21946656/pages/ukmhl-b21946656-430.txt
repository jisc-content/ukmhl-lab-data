414 is the most proper point of puncture. If the em- pyema is formed at a more distant period, the spot of election, as it is called, or between the (5th and 7th true ribs, is preferred. I should recom- mend a point considerably below the original wound, as adhesions, either general or partial, are apt to form in its neighbourhood. 1 have observ- ed great relief to follow this operation ; but 1 have also seen a removal of all the pulmonic symptoms take place, and death very frequently ensue short- ly after the puncture. In the examination of some of the bodies, I have met with abscesses in the very substance of the lungs, completely out of the reach of any operation, and not indicated by any pecu- liarity of symptoms during life. Nature sometimes makes an effort for the re- moval of the fluids effused in cases of empyema, by distant channels, but the instances are rare, and not often successful. M. Richard De liautes- cierck, in the Collection of Cases from the French military hospitals, edited by him, gives an high- ly interesting instance where the evacuation of a large quantity of purulent matter, by expec- toration, by stool, and by urine, relieved an ex- tensive empyema, which had succeeded a wound of the breast. A case somewhat analogous oc- curred at Brussels, where a trench prisoner was wounded by a musket ball, which entered the thorax between the 8th and 9th ribs, at the distance of two inches from the vertebra?, and lodged inter- nally, but in what situation was never afterwards

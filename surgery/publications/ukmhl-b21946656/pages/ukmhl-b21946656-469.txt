453 and of the arch of the colon, were visible through smaller rents, and, what was remarkable, no pait of the intestines protruded through these open- ings ; but the most singular circumstance was, that this wretched remnant of life conversed and took some refreshment, for which he repeatedly called during the forty-eight hours that he surviv- ed. No opportunity occurred of examining the body after death, although I was very anxious to observe whether nature had made any efforts to- wards a reparation of the injury, or had been excit- ed to any peculiar action. The wounds of the fixed viscera of the abdo- men, though highly dangerous, are not necessarily mortal; the simple principle of avoiding or subdu- ing inflammation must guide us in the attempts at relief in those cases. All deep wounds of the Spleen, Liver, or Kidney, are almost immediately fa- tal from hemorrhage ; some instances, however, oc- cur, where even severe injuries are survived. The slightest reflection on the situation and structure of the Kidney, and on its various sympathies, will at once show the desperate nature of wounds in- flicted on it, even with all the caution of a curative intention. In the excellent and learned memoir of M. Hevin on Nephrotomy, this point is most amply discussed and illustrated, and a great mass of evidence is produced on the subject. * The in- * Itecherches llistorique et Critiques sur la Nepbrotomie ou Taille du Rein, par M. llevin, Memoires de Lâ€™Acadcmie Royale de Chirurgie, Tome III. p. *238, fol. edit.

tion of the wound to the change of external applica- tion on the 7th day, which includes the period of in- flammation, the quantity of blood lost, including the general bleeding which preceded the application of the leeches, (which I would recommend always to be had recourse to, and in a very full stream,) amounted, by calculation, which I consider to be much within the mark, to 235 ounces. I think it more probable that the amount was 250, because, even in England, about one ounce per leech is the estimated quantity lost, and it must be admitted that the foreign surgeons are generally more ex- pert in their management of these animals than we are. The oozing between the bleedings wras also very great, and one day particularly, even active. The quantity of food taken during those seven days, or rather during the last four, was so small, that in comparison Valsalva’s diet was excess ;* but to this certainly much of the preservation of the limb was * The rigid mode employed by Valsalva for the cure of aneurisms is detailed by Morgagni, Letter 17, Article 30, and is as follows r—The patient, after losing as much blood as was deemed necessary, was confined to bed, from the commence- ment of the cure until its completion, restricted to a most absti- nent diet, gradually diminished in quantity till he could scarce- ly move himself. The solid food was diminished so low as to half a pound of pudding in the morning, and half that quantity in the evening. The drink water only, and that within a cer- tain weight, which he medicated with what he called ice of quinces, or the lapis osteocolla, ground down into a very fine powder. The return to a more nutritive diet was equally slow.

487 lodge in or near the bones of the pelvis, and some- times they enter the cavity through the natural foramina, constituting wounds of a most dangerous tendency from the nerves, blood-vessels, and im- portant organs which they injure. In some cases where a musket-ball has struck at point blank range, it has fairly penetrated the bone ; these cases are also highly dangerous, but there are some rare ex- ceptions, in which neither immediate death nor pa- ralysis take place. Mr Hammick, surgeon of the Royal Naval Hospital at Plymouth, was so kind as to show me a preparation made from a patient who had received a wound from a musket-ball, which passed through the right side of the sacrum, about three inches above the point of the os coccygis, and penetrated obliquely upwards. The ball was passed by stool in about two months after the infliction of the injury. The unfortunate man survived for two years, when, a discharge of feces coming on through the orifice in the bone, he died, exhausted by a complication of sufferings, but no paralytic affec- tion ever appeared. A case, precisely similar to this, was seen in the Military Hospital at Berlin, under the care of Dr Reich, by my friend Dr Thomson. In a case of an officer of the com- missariat, which occurred at Elvas, during the siege of Badajos, a ball passed through the sacrum, nearly in the same line of direction as in Mr Ham- mickâ€™s patient, and out over the symphysis pubis. Urine passed after the first few hours from the pos-

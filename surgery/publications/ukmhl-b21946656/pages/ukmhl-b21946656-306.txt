Dissection throws some light upon this inte- resting subject, and the results may be classed un- der the following heads :â€”1. Inflammation of the vessels. In some cases the veins, in others the arteries, and in others again both the veins and ar- teries, will be found inflamed, from the point of the stump to the very auricle or ventricle ; and in many parts, either lined with coagulable lymph, or filled with purulent matter to various distances. In the dissections conducted by Messrs Dobson, Bingham, and Crofton, after the battle of Water- loo, we met with no less than twelve cases where the veins were inflamed, and where, at the same time, purulent matter was found in the arteries, with a considerable thickening of their coats. In one case, wTe found the brachial artery alone af- fected. For three inches from its cut extremity it was very much thickened and filled with pus. In another case, dissected by hospital assistant Dob- son, the amputation had been performed low on the femur ; death ensued on the 17th day. The artery was not diseased, but the vein was inflamed from the point of the stump to the very auricle, and of a very bright pink ; when both iliac veins wrere taken from the body, the contrast was most remarkable ; that on the sound side preserved its natural appearance, which, however, at the junc- tion of the veins terminated abruptly, as it were by

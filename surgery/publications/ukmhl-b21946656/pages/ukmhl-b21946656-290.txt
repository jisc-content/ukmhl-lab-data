274 parts; for, in the thigh, the injuries of its head and neck are, beyond comparison more dan- gerous than those of any other part; next, those towards the middle of the bone, proceeding down- wards ; then the articulating extremity at the knee ; and, lastly, the portion from the condyles to the centre of the bone upwards. In the legs, on the contrary, the injuries of the tibia, near the ankle joint, are much more dangerous than those immediately below the knee, supposing the joint not to be implicated ; and, in the arm, many in- juries of the head of the bone, and its vicinity, may be got over with due attention, while those at the elbow-joint most commonly lead to the loss of the limb. In the fore-arm, again, the order of safety becomes reversed, and the injuries near the carpal articulation are less dangerous than those near the humeral. In all cases, the injury from a musket ball is less than from grape-shot, and in those less than from round. The state of the soft parts also must be taken seriously into considera- tion, particularly the blood-vessels. From deli- berately weighing all these circumstances, toge- ther with the peculiar constitution of the pa- tient, and the general healthy state of the hospital, our period of secondary amputation must be deter- mined. In some hospitals, and at certain periods, no operation succeeds well. In some subjects, also, the constitution seems to have lost all its energies ; the parts may be retained in apposition 6

Of wounds of the Spleen I have seen a few ; some of the slighter recovered, the deep invariably proved fatal.

Dio- nis, a very sagacious French author, whose work is well known in this country, has made a very strik- ing observation on this point, as applicable to the spleen. “ About thirty years ago,” says he, “ a certain sect of surgeons sprung up, who took great credit to themselves for performing the extirpation of the spleen ; they looked upon this part as use- less, and even hurtful, perhaps because they did not know its functions.

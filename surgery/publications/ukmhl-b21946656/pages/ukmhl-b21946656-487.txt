471 Paralysis of this organ is also a common effect from blows of shells, &c. and an actual diminution of its cavity occasionally takes place, by its thickening and adhesion to the pubes and other adjoining parts; rupture also sometimes occurs without any external solution of continuity. Time and mode- rate external stimuli are useful in the first case ; the antiphlogistic regimen, in all injuries, will go far to prevent the second ; but the last is an occurrence uniformly fatal. In addition to the observations upon the wounds of the bladder by the systematic writers, the military surgeon will derive much information from Garen- geot, and from Desportes, in the “ Operations de Chirurgie” of the former, and the “ Traite des Playes d’armes a feu” of the latter. Bordenave, in the Memoirs of the Academy, 2d Vol. p. 521, and Bourienne, in the “ Journal de Medecine,” Tome XXIX. are also well worth consulting. But the most instructive cases, that, I believe, are to be met with, will be found in the “ Memoires”ofMrLarrey. No special treatise exists, to my knowledge, upon the wounds of the bladder ; these wounds, it may be observed, are less dangerous in the full than the empty state of the organ, as there is less risk of an injury of the intestines being supcradded. A deep wound of the Liver is as fatal as if the heart itself was engaged ; the slighter injuries are recoverable, particularly if the membrane alone is injured. The site of the wound at once points

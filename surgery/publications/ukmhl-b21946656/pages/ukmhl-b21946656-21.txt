His “ Maniere de trader les Playes d’Arquebusades et Fleches” had already appeared in a separate form in 1551. Maggius published a work, “ De Vulnera Bom- bardarum et Sclopetorum,” at Bologna in 1552, and Alphonsus Ferrius followed on the same subject, the ensuing year at Lyons. Rota, a public lecturer at Bologna, published at that place a book entitled “De Tormentariorum Vulnerum Curatione et Natura,” in the year 1555; and Leonardus Botallus, by far the best author of the Italian school, produced his work, “ De Curandis Vulneribus Sclopetorum,” at Lyons, in 1560. These authors, together with De Vigo, another Italian, and the Germans Hieronymus a Brunswich, and Gersdorf, who flourished prior to Pare, and J.

480 lowing the curvature of the ribs ; nor have 1, in those cases which have come within my view, ever observed that peculiar spasm, (risus Sardonicus,) described by the older authors, and lately noticed by M. Percy. The prevention of inflammation is the leading indication of cure ; but injuries are fre- quently found on dissection, which were not at all indicated during life by any peculiar symptoms. Sometimes the diaphragm is injured in two dif- ferent points by the same ball; an interesting illus- tration of this has been furnished me by my friend Dr Thomson. A lad received a wound from a musket ball, which entered the left side between the 10th and 11th ribs posteriorly, and passed out nearly in a direct line beneath the 8th, at the dis- tance of live inches from the sternum ; he died on the <Oth day. On dissection, a considerable quan- tity of air escaped from the left cavity of the thorax ; it contained about three pounds of bloody serum â€¢, the lungs on that side were completely collapsed, though, on inflating them, they did not appear to be wounded; the surface of the lungs, pleura, and upper part of the diaphragm, were co- vered with coagulable lymph, which adhered very loosely; the ball broke the 11th rib, and, drove some splinters of it into the diaphragm, entered the thorax, passed through the septum into the abdomen, grazed the upper surface of the spleen, which was covered with coagulated blood, return- ed again through the diaphragm into the cavity

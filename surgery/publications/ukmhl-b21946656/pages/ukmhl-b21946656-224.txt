208 the removal of a limb, by showing the site of balls, splinters, ligatures, &c. will often very satisfactorily explain the source of many nervous symptoms, yet we are frequently left altogether in the dark. In the very interesting case given us by Dr Denmark in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. IV. the source of the patientâ€™s torture, ap- proaching to tic doloureux, was satisfactorily traced to the imbedding of a portion of a leaden ball into the posterior part of the radial nerve j but al- though a lesion of this nature was suspected pre- vious to amputation, and indeed almost demon- strated, by the symptoms and the site of the wound, yet, on mature reflection, amputation was prefer- red to any partial excision of the nerve. And I apprehend, if we consider the great extent to which the thickened and diseased state of the investing membrane of nerves may reach ; the certainty of greatly lessening, and perhaps eventually destroy- ing the motion and sensibility of the parts to which they are distributed, by cutting off the communi- cation with the sensorium ; the contracted or dis- torted state in which the limb generally is ; and the possibility of exciting universal and highly danger- ous commotion of the system ; we will rather prefer the almost certain effects of amputation, where any operation is required, to the more brilliant but ambiguous promises held out by a dexterous dis- section.

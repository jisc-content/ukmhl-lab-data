437 with blood; their accumulation must be guarded against by a rigorous diet; for, to the general state of fulness of the vessels induced by food, is added its local and mechanical stimulus in the undigested form. By this treatment penetrating wounds, in which several plicae of the intestines have been ne- cessarily implicated, have been happily cured. Au- thors abound with instances of this kind, and I have seen several; among others, I have been a witness to the recovery of a soldier who had been shot through the abdomen by a ramrod, which passed in anteriorly, and actually stuck in one of the transverse processes of the vertebra?, from which it was not disengaged without the application of some force ; this occurrence took place befoie Ba- dajos in 1813 ; it is to be hoped that the gentle- man under whose care the case fell will favour the profession with an account of it. Some instances are on record, and among them one remarkable one by Garengeot, and another by Lamotte, where a sword had passed right across the cavity of the ab- domen without injuring a single fold of the intes- tines, to which possibly this case may be analogous. In some instances the ball, or a part of the wea- pon which has inflicted the wound, remains within the abdominal cavity, and is afterwards evacuated by the natural passages. The subject of the fol- lowing case I saw while under cure, and I had very lately an opportunity of examining him again and taking the account from his own lips.

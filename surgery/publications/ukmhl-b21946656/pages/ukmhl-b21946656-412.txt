it abstractedly, is not a dangerous symptom of those injuries ; neither is it by any means so fre- quent as has been supposed. The symptoms that f have now enumerated, whether single or in com- bination, may be deemed the primary effects of wounds of the thorax; violent inflammatory affec- tions of the lungs and the membranes, ever subject to relapse ; long and tedious suppurations, and ex- foliations of the bones, are the secondary, and, though not so rapidly fatal, are often as certainly so as the others. Diseases which, although we cannot strictly call them pulmonary consumption, agree with them in many points, particularly in cough, emaciation, debility, and hectic, are often the consequences. In whatever part of the thorax a ball, bayonet, or sabre strikes, our first object is to diminish the quantity of circulating blood, so vast a proportion of which passes through the contents of the cavity. On this the very existence of our patient depends ; and we cannot from reasoning a priori fix any bounds to the quantity to be taken, or determine the intervals at which it is to flow ; our practice in both respects must be governed by the effects. There lies a man with a wound of his chest; the blood is oozing from the external orifice in a con- stant, though slow florid track ; in his frequent and painful efforts to cough, it is thrown up in frothy arterial mouthfuls, mixed with occasional clots; his breathing is oppressed almost to suffocation ;

405 experiments of Messrs Hewson and Littre in the respective Memoirs of the Academy of Surgery at Paris, and of the Medical Society of London. When this sunk state of the lung occurs, it obvi- ously reduces a man to half his usual allowance of air; it is, therefore, though not necessarily fatal, a very hardy act of a surgeon who deliberately runs the risk of depriving him of the other, by puncturing the sound side of the thorax. That the opening both sides of the thorax at once has been fatal in man, experience has proved, and this when the opening was made, both by accident and with a curative intention ; it must be confessed, however, that with all the experiments and facts before us, there is still an ambiguity in the “ phi- losophy of emphysema,” to use a term of Mr John Bell’s, hitherto unravelled, notwithstanding his il- lustrations of the point. From experiments on brutes we derive no satisfactory elucidation, for in some, where incisions on each side have been made through the intercostal muscles, much greater than the natural passage of the air, the lungs, so far from collapsing, have puffed out, the animal has lived, and in ten days ran about as well as ever; and in our own species, the recoveries from wounds of the thorax on both sides, larger than the orifice of the glottis, dangerous as they are, are not a fewr. The distressing state of the respiration conse- quent on general emphysema has led to a great anxiety on the part of surgeons to remove it, and,

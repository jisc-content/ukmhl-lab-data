411 Under all these unfavourable circumstances, Gunn sunk apace, and died hectic. Ihe following were the appearances on dissection : On opening the chest, that cavity appeared to be considerably dimi- nished, and the lungs on both sides were found ad- hering very firmly to the pleura costalis. The consistence of those organs was firmer than usual ; and, when cut into, their air cells appeared to be almost obliterated. The ramifications of the bron- chiÂ® appeared to be filled with puriform mucus. At the upper and posterior part of the left side of the thorax, a cavity was found existing between the surfaces of the pleura pulmonalis, and costalis, capable of containing from 10 to 12 cubic inches of air. The inner surface of this cavity was lined with a thick firm membrane of coagulable lymph, particularly strong in the place where the lungs ad- hered to the parietes of the chest; it contained only a small quantity of pus, which seemed to have been secreted chiefly from the ulcerated surface of the lungs, forming the parietes of this cavity. Two small openings were observable at the upper part of the cavity, penetrating through the pleura cos- talis, between the 2d and Sd ribs, and communi- cating with an abscess which existed in the upper and back part of the shoulder. It was obvious, that the second rib, a small portion of wdiich was found bare, had been fractured by the bullet which in- flicted the wound, and that a considerable quantity of callus had been thrown out on the reunion of

SO7 of the fractured portions, if they lie loose, and the elevation of the depressions, where it can be done without the infliction of additional violence, are, of course, the first steps to be taken j but instances (particularly on the field) will occur, where this cannot be done. The grand and leading point to be kept in view in those cases, is the great ten- dency to inflammation of the brain and its mem- branes, the uncertain period at which it may oc- cur, and the very doubtful consequences which may succeed its occurrence. So irregular, however, and as it were so capricious is nature, that, while the slightest causes produce inflammation in its most violent and aggravated forms, extensive in- juries, fracture, depression, and even permanent compression from lodgment of balls, have been followed by no such consequences. In the follow- ing case, the injury to the brain, and the extinc- i tion of existence, were contemporaneous. CASE.

481 of the thorax, and passed out below the 8th rib, none of the other viscera appeared to be wounded. Pare ‘dves us two cases in his 10th book, where the colon passed through an opening of the dia- phragm made by a ball, and another, where the stomach passed through one made by a sword. I have already mentioned a case where a hernia of the stomach was found through a hole in the dia- phragm, supposed to have been made by a musket ball. M. llavier, in the Journal de Med. Mili- taire, Vol. I. p. Ill*, gives a case where the principal viscera of the abdomen passed into the thorax, after the receipt of a violent blow on the belly ; and Mr Boyle, surgeon of the 6°2d regi- ment, gives a case of hernia of the stomach through a wound in the diaphragm, in the Ed. Med. Jour. Vol. VIII. p. 42. Morgagni, valuable on every subject, is highly so on the injuries of the dia- phrd^m, in his 53d and 54th Epistle ; but the most interesting account that I am acquainted with, is given in the article “ Diaphragme,” in the “ Dic- tionnaire des Sciences Medicales,” by M. Percy.

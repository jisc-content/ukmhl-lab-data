the fracture. The abscess over the shoulder was immediately under the skin and cellular membrane, and extended several inches backwards and down- wards from the external wound. No distinct marks could be seen of the course of the ball. After the extraction of extraneous matters, and the cessation of hemorrhage, it is still a question among some surgeons, whether wounds of the thorax should be dressed simply and lightly, or kept artifi- cially open by the introduction of lint in the form of tents, &c. and of metallic canulas for allowing the exit of putrid blood, matter, and air. From my own experience, I have no hesitation in giving the pre- ference to mild easy dressings, where it becomes ne- cessary, from the formation of extensive collections of purulent matter, or bloody sanies, to keep the wound at all open. If the patient is placed in a pro- per position, that is, with the wound in a dependant posture, (and, in general, he lies by choice on the affected side,) the exit of effused fluids is not ne- cessarily impeded. If they exist in large quantity, the wound is effectually prevented from closing, by the state of general irritation in which the system is kept by their effusion, and by their pres- sure on the lungs. If the How is so minute as to admit of the union of the wound, the quantity ef- fused is within the j)ower of the absorbents to re- move, and will produce no constitutional effects. I have seen, among foreign surgeons, tents and ca- nulas so long continued, as to give rise to the very

by straps and bandages, but their approximation is mechanical, and not seconded by any healthful effort of nature, while men in the same ward re- cover fast; obviously demonstrating that localit.es have no influence on them, although it must be confessed, that generally, when one sore goes wrong, great numbers follow the example. Re- moval, then, affords the only security for success. Could we always follow our own wishes, as we sometimes may in the case of officers, or insulated individuals, we would defer amputation until fever of every kind and degree was subdued. This is out of the question in a large military hospital. Where we are at all liable to contagion, we must content ourselves with moderating instead of re- moving febrile affections. Had a surgeon his choice, he would perhaps wait for an amendment in the sharp, quick, small pulse of hectic, a restoration of appetite, a regularity of the bowels, and a diminu- tion of the sweating tendency, and of the cough. But it is most satisfactory to know, that the re- moval of the local injury often rapidly affects the mitigation of those sympathetic consequences. I have very little to add to the numerous ex- cellent works on the operative part of this subject; but as I think I have derived much benefit from attention to a few simple particulars, I shall briefly state them. First, where the tourniquet is used to com-

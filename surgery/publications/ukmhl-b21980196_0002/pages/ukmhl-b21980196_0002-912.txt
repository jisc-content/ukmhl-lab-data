Under the term Rectal Fistula is comprehended every fistulous suppurating- passage in the neighbourhood of the rectum, in which either merely the tissue surrounding the outer walls of that gut is destroyed, or the fistulous passage communicates with the cavity of the rectum Rectal fistulas are therefore distinguished into the perfect, (F. ani com- plete,) and imperfect, (F. ani incompletce,) according as they have an ex- ternal and internal opening communicating with the cavity of the rectum ; or they have an internal or external opening alone, imperfect internal (external blind) and imperfect external (internal blind) rectal fistulas. They also present numerous other differences ; the fistulous canal may extend far up into the cavity, may be accompanied with many external openings, may extend far beneath the external skin, and be accompanied with callosities and hardening, with foreign bodies, with disease of the neighbouring parts, the bladder, urethra, vagina, and so on, or even with caries of the bones of the pelvis. 924. The causes of rectal fistulas, are injuries of the internal coat of the rectum by foreign bodies which pass with the stools, producing inflam- mation and suppuration, suppurating bunches of haemorrhoids, by which the internal membrane of the rectum is destroyed. These fistulas generally form slowly; the patient has for a long time itching at the anus, and a knobby swelling forms about it, which often merely empties itself by a small opening, or the fistula has little disposition to break externally, but rather spreads upwards, and may be connected above by a second opening with the rectum (a) ; or an abscess may form about the anus from hardening, from injury, from burrowing of pus from another part, which deprives the exterior wall of the rectum more or less completely of its cellular tissue. These abscesses are often critical, and the patient is thereby freed from other complaints, from affections of the chest and so on; often they are merely consequent on gorging of the haemorrhoidal vessels, from diseases of the breast and liver. 925. The condition of the fistula is in part shown by the nature of its origin, the foecal or merely purulent discharge, and the passage of intes- tinal gas from it, especially after examination with the probe. 926.

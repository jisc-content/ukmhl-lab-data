Trans, vol. xix. 1835. 617- Fracture of the Pelvic Bones is rare on account of their great strength, deep situation, and thick covering ; it therefore always requires very great violence, by which most commonly severe injury to the soft parts is produced ; or the same symptoms as in fracture of the spine, may be caused by injury of the spinal marrow. The fracture may happen to the rump-hone, to the coccyx, to the hip, share or liuunch hone. 618. Fracture of the Bump-hone, {Fractura OssisSacri, Lat.; Bruch der Heiligenbeines, Germ.; Fracture du Sacrum, Fr.,) at its upper part, is unconnected with any displacement, therefore the diagnosis is generally difficult; but if it happen at the lower part, the lower piece is displaced inwards, (forwards,) and for its replacement the finger well oiled must be introduced into the rectum, and press the bone outwards (back.) A thick compress, moistened with a dispersing lotion, must be applied on the rump- bone, and fastened with a broad bandage surrounding the whole pelvis. The rest of the treatment is the same as in fracture of the vertebra, and must be directed against inflammation of the pelvic intestines, and the symptoms of palsy of the spine or of the sacral nerves. [This is an accident of very rare occurrence; there is, however, in the College Museum, an example of vertical fracture of this bone. The patient died of suppuration six weeks after the accident, and there was not any union.—J. F. S.] 619. The Coccyx {das Steissbein, Germ.) rarely breaks, on account of its great mobility and deep situation. It happens specially in old persons, in whom the connexions of its several pieces have become ossified. The cause is usually a fall upon the rump, consequent on which fixed pain occurs in the region of the coccyx, which is increased in walking; and distinct motion of the ends of the fracture is felt. If the under piece of bone be driven in, (forwards,) it must be replaced by introducing the finger into the rectum ; a moistened compress is then to be applied over the seat of fracture, which is to be fastened with a T bandage, and the general treat- ment is to be directed according to the accompanying symptoms. [This accident, commonly so called is, I suspect, rather a tearing of the ligamentous expansion in which the several pieces of the bone are enclosed, the bony pieces them- selves being too small and too spongy to break, except squeezed between two hard substances, which is scarcely possible. Though seemingly a very trivial accident, it is often exceedingly painful and annoying for many months; indeed, I have known two cases where it was not recovered from for nearly two years; the one followed sitting down suddenly on the edge of a snuff-box, which jammed in between the side of the coccyx and the spine of the haunch-bone; and the other, by the patient having been thrown from a horse upon a heap of stones. In these cases the pain was not so great as usually said to be, in walking, because the patients learned to walk without disturb- ing the bone; but the pain was agonizing when they incautiously sat down on a soft seat. Leeching afforded only temporary relief; and the cure was at last effected, after months, by protecting the coccyx from all possibility of pressure, by constantly wearing

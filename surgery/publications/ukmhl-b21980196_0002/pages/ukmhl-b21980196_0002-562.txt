! 376 TETANUS, [Watson’s opinion of Marochetti’s theory is, I apprehend, more correct than Che- i lius’s, and his mode of explaining the appearances fully borne out. He says, “ This I was a very pretty theory, and took mightily in the medical world. But it has turned out a sort of hoax. I do not mean a wilful hoax on the part of Dr. Marochetti, for i I have no doubt that he contrived to hoax himself. These pustules have been looked for again and again; but they have never been discovered in Englishmen affected with hydrophobia, nor in English mad dogs. The truth seems to be, that the mucous follicles i of the mouth generally, and those at the base of the tongue, and those beneath the tongue in particular, are commonly enlarged and exaggerated in the dog, and in the human animal, labouring under the disease; and these enlarged and altered follicles were regarded by the Russian physician as a specific eruption, which furnished the virus and pabulum of the complaint.” (pp. 605, 6.)] 369. In addition to the above-named remedies, opium, musk, and many other anti-spasmodic substances, stramonium (a), cantharides, fluid alkalies, large bleedings, cold plunging-baths at the onset, and a number of secret and vulgar remedies have been recommended after the breaking out of the hydrophobia. Experience speaks most in favour of bleeding at the onset of the disease, even to faintness, and its repetition at every fresh outbreak, as well also as for the simultaneous use of mercury to salivation, of bella- donna and of laurel water in very large doses (/>). The wound or scar should always be treated in the way heretofore laid down. There still remain to be proved the use of chlorine (e), the injection of warm water into the veins after bleeding (d), the internal use of lead in large doses (e), and the em- ployment of a Russian vapour bath of 50° of heat for an hour (/).

[ i* 1 TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. It is a common practice in the German Medical Schools for the Teacher to publish a Textbook on the subject of which he treats, and, taking this with him into the Class-room, to enlarge upon it, and thus form his lecture. This is the reason why, in the work of CiieLius, many things are but slightly noticed, and some only hinted at, which seem worthy of being fully and completely detailed. Had I confined myself to a mere translation of my original, many important points must have been omitted, and the object for which I undertook the publication of the Handbook could not have been attained. I was therefore obliged to resort to annotations and com- ments, the result of my own experience and reading, for the purpose of filling up and enlarging the Author’s short notices, so as to render them more generally useful both to the student and the prac- titioner. In doing this I have far exceeded the limits I had origin- ally proposed to myself, hut the subject is so important, and fresh matter was so constantly at hand, that my great difficulty has been in restricting my work within its present bounds. My first object in undertaking this task was to render Surgeons in this country more conversant with foreign practice than they had hitherto been. French Surgery, with its showy, hut sometimes too hazardous operations, had indeed been pretty well known among us ever since the peace of 1815, soon after which, medical students, with other British visitors, flocked in crowds to the French capital. But of the Surgery of the German Schools very little had been known in England until within the last few years, no standard German book having appeared in English since the publication of IIeister’s valuable work a century ago.

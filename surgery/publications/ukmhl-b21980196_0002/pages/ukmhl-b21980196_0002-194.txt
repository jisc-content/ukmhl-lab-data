The two endowments are now consolidated, and the lectures on human anatomy and Surgery are called Arris’s and Gale’s Lectures.—j. f. s.] In this way, assisted by the advance of anatomy, was Surgery raised, by Pare, Franco, Fabricius IIildanus, Fabricius ab Aquapen- dente, Severinus, and AVTesemann, in the sixteenth century, to a high station. In the second half of the sixteenth century actually commences the brilliant period of Surgery. Numerous wars and the establishment of public hospitals presented a rich field for observation, and the foundation of the Academy of Surgery at Paris collected scattered powers and aroused a general emulation. In France shone out Dionis, J. L. Petit, Mare- sciial, Quesnay, Morand (a), Louis, Ledran, Garengeot, Lafaye, Lecat, Lamotte, Ravaton, David, Pouteau, Levret, Sabatier, Desault; in England, Wiseman, Ciieselden (b), Douglas, the two Monros, Sharp, Cowper, Alanson, Pott, Hawkins, Smellie, and the two IIunters ; in Holland, Albin, Deventer, Camper ; in Italy, Mollinelli, Bertrandi, Moscati, Scarpa ; in Germany, Heister, Plattner, Bilguer, Brambilla, Theden, Richter, C. Siebold, and Mursinna. By this general cultivation has Surgery been brought up in modern times to an elevation which cannot be displayed generally but only in the history of the several operations. Boldness grounded on the progress of anatomy and physiology, simplicity in the methods of treatment, and scientific culture, distinguish it. The equal participation of all civilized nations in these efforts keeps up amongst them a contest for intellectual superiority in the ranks of improve- ment, while it makes any decisive award impossible. (a) He was Secretary to the Academy of Sur- gery, and, on the opening of the schools in 1743, delivered a most admirable address, " Discours dans lequel on prouve qu’il est necessaire au Chirurgien d’etre lettre,” in which he shows the necessity of a literary education for a Surgeon, and mentions incidentally that the royal declaration founding the Academy, required “ that the Sur- geons of Paris should be Masters of Arts before admission into the community, and that they should then pursue Surgery without mixing any mechanics,” “ loi precieuse,” says he, “ qni, faisant une des epoques les plus memorables pour l’illustration de notre art, doit immortaliser celui (De la Peyronie) qui la sollicitee et dont les titres eminens sont soutenus par un merite supe- rieur.” Opuscules de Chirurgxe, p. lid.

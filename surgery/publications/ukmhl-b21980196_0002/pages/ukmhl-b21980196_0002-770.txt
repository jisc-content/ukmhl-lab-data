584 FRACTURES OF THE is usually very tiresome when both bones are broken, and in general cannot be managed with the gummed, starched, or plastered apparatus, nor by placing the limb on the side. In these cases it is almost always necessary to have the leg straight and resting on the* heel, with a pair of side splints, and constant extension by weighting the foot, as men- tioned in the general treatment of fractures, to prevent the riding of the fractured ends and the liability of their protrusion through the skin. Sometimes an Amesbury’s or Assalini’s appai-atus is found most effectual to keep the fracture in place, and at other times the swing-box serves the purpose best. But not unfrequently it is a very difficult matter to keep the fracture quiet and in proper position, and the Surgeon’s ingenuity is sorely taxed to conduct the case satisfactorily for the first few days; after which, how- ever, the difficulties generally subside. But as the bones are so close to the skin, this fracture requires more especial attention than any other to prevent the bones driving through. I have not taken any notice of fracture of the leg-bones accompanied with dislocation, as that subject will be more conveniently treated of at a future opportunity.—J. F.

(Fractura Ossium Pedis, Lat.; Brucli der Knochen des Fusses, Germ.; Fractures des Os de Pied, Fr.J 710. The bones of the foot are rarely broken, on account of their great strength and shortness ; their fracture therefore, mostly consequent on the immediate operation of external violence, is accompanied with bruis- ing of the soft parts, and with crushing of the bones, and must be treated according to the ordinary rules. In severe crushing, the extirpation of some bones, the excision of the front of the foot, or the amputation of the

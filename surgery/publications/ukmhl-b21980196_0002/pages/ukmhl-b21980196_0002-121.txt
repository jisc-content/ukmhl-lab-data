CX1U ANALYTICAL INDEX. which ulceration of the articular cartilages of bony and fibrous anchylosis, i. 245; in adult cartilages, i. 226; Meckel, Bi- chat, and Muller on the vessels of carti- lage, i. 226; Brodie’s opinion that carti- lages are vascular, i. 227; Toynbee, Beclard, and Cruveilhier distinctly of opinion that cartilages are devoid of vas- cularity, i. 227; W. Hunter’s views on the structure of cartilage generally cor- rect, i. 227 ; symptoms of inflammation of cartilage, i. 227 ; Mayo on three distinct forms of ulceration of joint-cartilages, i. 228; Wilson on inflammation of cartilage, i. 228; Hunter, Wilson, and Brodie, on the ulcerative absorption of, i. 228, 229 ; Lawrence on ulceration of cartilage as an original affection of the joints, i. 229 ; Key on the conditions under which ulcera- tion of the cartilages is effected, i. 229; Key on the absorption of cartilage by a new membrane produced by inflammation of the synovial membrane, i. 229 ; Key on the progress of ulceration in cartilage, i. 230; Goodsir holds with Key that the deposit from the synovial membrane is the cause of ulceration in cartilage, i. 231; accordance of Key’s views with those of Wilson, i. 232; Key on the changes in the synovial membrane, when suppuration is the 'result of a wound in it, i. 232 ; they induce ulcerative absorption of the articu- lar cartilages, i. 232 ; Brodie does not ac- cord with Key’s views, and considers that absorption of cartilage may take place under such circumstances as to admit of no other agency than that of the vessels of the cartilage, i. 233 ; Lawrence's case of rapid ulceration of cartilage, i. 234 ; Lawrence on the necrosis of long bones as a cause of inflammation and absorption of cartilage, i. 234; Key on the formation of an adventitious membrane in joints under such circumstances, i. 234; this is a re- pairing process, preparatory to anchylosis, i. 234 ; Henle explains the absorption of cartilage from want of nutriment, i. 234 ; Key on ulceration of cartilage, an action altogether different from absorption, i. 235; Key on the process of ulceration generally, i. 235 ; Key on the process by which ulceration of the cartilage is effect- ed, i. 235; it leads to the formation of abscess, i. 235 ; post-mortem appearances, i. 236; Schumer and Gendrin never found any trace of inflammation in cartilage, i. 236; Brodie and South consider ulcera- tion of cartilages differs from common inflammation of the synovial membrane, and of the spongy ends of bones, i. 236 ; Brodie on the degeneration of cartilage into a fibrous structure, i. 236 ; this change Key describes as the third mode of ulcera- tion of cartilage, i. 236; causes of the disease, i. 237; Brodie on the period at may occur, i. 237 ; prognosis always un- favourable, i. 237 ; treatment, i. 237. In- flammation of the joint-ends of bones, i. 237 ; symptoms, i. 237 ; Brodie on inflam- mation of the joint-ends of the bones, its symptoms and progress, i. 238 ; Brodie on the consequence of this inflammation, i. 238 ; Key on the two forms of disease in the bone, resulting in absorption of the car- tilage, i. 238; the chronic form is of a strumous nature, i. 238 ; the acute form differs from the former in the suddenness of the attack, and in the appearance of the bone, i. 238 ; progress of the acute disease, and appearance of the bone, i. 239 ; Good- sir on tlie scrofulous disease of the cancel- lated texture of the heads of bone, i. 239 ; post-mortem appearances, i. 239 ; situation and causes of the disease, i. 239 ; Brodie and Key on the period at which it is likely to occur, i. 239; Brodie observes that it is likely to occur in several joints at once, or in succession, i. 239; Brodie and South’s opinion that the occurrence of scrofulous disease in the joint has sus- pended the progress of some other and perhaps more serious disease elsewhere, i. 240; Brodie on the diagnosis between scrofulous disease of the joint-ends of bones and ulceration of the articular car- tilages, i. 240; prognosis and treatment, i. 240 ; favourable consequences of ulcera- tion of the cartilages, i. 240 ; may occur in one of two ways, i. 240 ; in the first the cartilage is replaced by a layer of ivory-like bone, and the motions of the joint continue, i. 240; in the second, the opposed ends of the bones are united, either by a ligamento-fibrous structure, or by bone, i. 240; South has seen the con- necting medium composed partly of liga- mento fibrous, and partly of bony matter, i. 240; South on the ivory-like covering of the joint-surfaces of bones, i. 240 ; Key and Toynbee on the removal of the arti- cular cartilages in old age i. 241 ; South and Brodie on the removal of the articular cartilages in old age as the result of pre- vious ulceration, i. 241; John Hunter on anchylosis, i. 241; anchylosis effected by the whole sul>stance of the articulation, i. 241 ; of two kinds, i. 241 ; Hunter on the inflammatory and scrofulous diseases of joints causing anchylosis, i. 242; Hunter on soft anchylosis from granulations, i. 242 ; Hunter on bony anchylosis, i. 242 ; South’s views on anchylosis differ somewhat from those of Hunter, i. 242; South on soft anchylosis from granulations, i. 242; Key on the formation of a vascular membrane in joints as a preliminary to anchylosis, i. 242; South’s case of fibrous anchylosis, i. 243 ; South's case of the complication

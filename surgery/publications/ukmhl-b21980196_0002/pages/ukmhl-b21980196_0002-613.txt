These abscesses of the liver often form without being noticed ; often are they preceded by symptoms of more or less active inflammation. The pus is frequently superficial, but most commonly deep in the substance of the liver, and the entire parenchyma of that structure is not (infrequently entirely destroyed by it. In such abscesses swelling and fluctuation may be observed in the region of the liver, and the abscess opens externally ; it may also empty itself into the general cavity of the belly, into the stomach, into the intestine, or into the cavity of the chest. 456. It is therefore necessary to prevent such abscesses, which, however, on account of their concealed mode of origin is often impossible. In symptoms of inflammatory irritation of the liver, bleedings and long con- tinued antiphlogistic purgings, especially antimonial wine properly diluted, are indicated. If the abscess show externally, it must be, as usual, opened. If the outflowing pus be good and of white colour, the prognosis is more favourable than if it be of a yellowish brown colour. The powers of the patient are to be supported by strengthening medicine, and a ready outlet must be furnished for the pus.

A very important object in the treatment of wounds of the face is the prevention of scars ; in all cases, therefore, if the wound gape widely, if it be irregular and large, if a strong beard or the peculiar position of the wound prevent the close lying of the sticking plaster, and no contra indications to quick union exist, the suture should be applied. Al- though wounds of the face usually bleed freely, yet the bleeding from the little vessels is safely stanched by the proper union of the edges. [The twisted suture upon thin pins is the best remedy in all wounds about the face, excepting those of the eyelids, where, in consequence of their recession behind the bony margin of the orbit, they cannot be used. A cold wet rag is to be kept constantly applied, whichever suture is employed, and the suture itself must be removed after thirty or forty hours. Even if the wound be produced by a blunt instrument, it is advisable to attempt union with the suture. If the cut be at any part where there is hair, the edges of the wound must be so carefully adjusted that no hairs should jut into them, as thereby the union will be prevented, and irritation excited.—J. F. S.] 458. Wounds of the region of the Egcbrow, when they are especially dis- posed to union, if they be vertical, are always united with sticking plaster; but transverse wounds require the suture. If such wounds heal by suppu-

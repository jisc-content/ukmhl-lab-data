Fracture of the Neck of the Thigh-bone (Fractura colli femoris) may be either within or without the capsular ligament; it may be par- tial bj within or ivitliout the capsular ligament; it may be double, and accompanied with separation of the trochanter. The direction of the frac- ture ivithin the capsule, is mostly transverse, and the fibrous covering of the neck of the thigh-bone is more or less torn ; but without, the fracture is in general oblique. The broken surfaces are mostly uneven, and sup- port themselves by their toothed shape ; the upper may be locked into the lower end of the fracture. 668. The most frequent cause of the fracture is violence acting on the great trochanter; also a fall upon the outstretched foot, or upon the knee. Often also from very slight causes, for instance a false step, in which the foot slips, especially when in advanced age the neck of the thigh-bone is brittle and fragile (par. 575). This fracture happens most frequently in advanced age, and more commonly in women than in men. The varia- tion in the direction of the neck of the thigh-bone at different periods of life, the greater length of the neck, and the greater projection of the great trochanter in females, as well as the brittleness of the bone in advanced age, renders this intelligible. 669. The general signs of this fracture are, a previous fall on the great trochanter, the foot, or knee ; fixed pain in the hip-joint; sudden inca- pability of walking or standing, or at least great difficulty in so doing; shortening of the limb immediately or some time after the fracture ; ap- proach of the great trochanter to the spine of the hip-bone and less pro- jection ; restoration of the natural length of the limb by moderate extension, so long as the contraction of the muscles has not from its continuance become great; then at least considerable force must be employed ; ready recurrence of the shortening when the extension is given up ; incapability of the patient to raise the limb straight up when he lies in the horizontal posture; in almost all cases turning of the thigh and front of the foot outwards, and facility in returning it to its natural position, and even 2 o 2

24 pose to dilate on points here barely alluded to, to devolop the scheme -which appears best fitted to fulfil the wants of the present Surgical Epoch, and especially to lay down the plan which is to be our guide and foundation in the study of chnical surgery. I rely firmly on my students penetrating the spirit of my designs, and co-operating in their execution, with that love of truth, and of good intention, which affords joys so pure and warm, as to compensate even the greatest sorrows and trials of man's life.

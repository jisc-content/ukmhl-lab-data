20 of studiesâ€”in surgery, a study, unhappily much neglected. Here, again, I prefer to utter my thoughts after the model, and in the very words, of the great masters. " It is not from the observations and the expe- rience of a single man that the required knowledge can be obtained. It is necessary to collect the observations which are dispersed in the works of our predecessors and contemporaries. Without this work the greatest genius can only be an unenlightened and presumptuous practitioner."^ " The very highest study of all, I mean the history of our science, is very much neglected. It is too much the rage of our time to be satisfied with superficial and imperfect studies, with such scanty gleanings of knowledge as are to be gathered from mere school books and the mouth of a teacher But I have to explain to you the importance of studying the history of our science. We have laying before us, chal- lenging us to diligence, all the successive improvements of two thousand years. The study of these calls into action every faculty of the mind, fertihzes the invention, ripens the judgment, and makes us really fit to decide upon the modes and practices which are to be preferred.

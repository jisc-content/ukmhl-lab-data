16 the greater facility of weaving the former than of digging out and piling up the latter, are potent causes, which dispose to so much exaggeration in theoretical pursuit, that its legitimate end is departed from, and real practical science, the application of rules which science and observa- tion have discovered, suffers pari passu. But such examples only afford illustrations of the frailty of men's minds, and prove, that all are not equally competent to the great work in view; they in no degree tend to subvert the proposition that, it is only by a just appreciation and combina- tion of theory and practice that surgical, or any other science, can flourish. To utilize the truths of surgical science, there can be no question that operative procedure with the knife is the chief agency, and hence it would seem impossible to direct to it too much attention. Neither is it possible in one sense. Operative surgery cannot be known too well; its student cannot be too skilfiil; but of this he must be careful, not to exclude from his consideration other no less important subjects. For the obser- vations on this point, which emanated from the Academy of Surgery, and from such a master of the art, as Mr. John Bell, we have almost greater need at present than had the students to whom they were directly addressed.

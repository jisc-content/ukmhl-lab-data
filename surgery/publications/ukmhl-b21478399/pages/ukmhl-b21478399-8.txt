Institution, is so much matter of history as to dispense with the necessity of further notice on my part, beyond an expression of gratitude for the extreme kindness with which he inducted me to enjoy the honor of activity, in the posi- tion from which he has retired in the noon of a long Hfe, to pass its even in the enjoyment of merited ease and honor. For the present, my position as a lecturer in this theatre will be that of a clinical commentator on cases in the wards at the Hospital; I have already had occasion to direct the students' attention, at the bedside, to several cases of peculiar interest in a therapeutic no less than in a diagnostic point of view ; but rather than develop at present the various doctrinal and practical considerations which those cases suggest, I have come to the determination to enunciate opinions on some questions more generally affecting the science of surgery. Progress is to institutions, as to nations and in- dividuals, essential to continued existence. The statu quo is impossible : let it be tolerated for an instant, decadence ensues. How best, how most rapidly, yet most safely and most efficiently to progress,â€”this is the question, and to its solution, in the sphere of surgical action, I propose addressing myself.

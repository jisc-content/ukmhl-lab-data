SUICIDE 420 had been taught that suicide was strongly hereditary was informed that an uncle on her father's side had killed himself. She was greatly depressed by this, and had fears as to her own future. While she was under this depression her father himself committed suicide, and this so affected her mind that she attempted suicide. But her mother, being then seriously alarmed for her child, confided to her that her reputed father was not really her father, and that therefore her ideas about the fatal heredity were baseless. From that time the depression gradually abated, and the girl regained complete soundness of mind. Statistics of Different Countries.—There is no branch of vital statistics in which it is necessary to be more guarded before drawing inferences than the statistics of suicide. In no country are the official figures altogether ac- curate or complete, and the principles upon which they are collected differ so greatly that comparisons between the statistics of different countries must be made with some reserve. Subject to this caution, however, the following table may be accepted as based on the most trust- worthy data that are available :— Numbers of Suicides by Different Methods IN European Countries (a) Rates per Million of Population Methods.

The table also shows that in most countries suicide by five methods— hanging, drowning, gunshot, cutting or stabbing, and poison—includes more than 90 per cent of the whole number of cases. Of all the methods, suicide by hanging may be accepted as yielding the most trustworthy figures, such deaths being seldom either concealed or attributed to any cause except suicide. The first section of the table gives the average annual rates per million of population, and this is the most instructive section. The second section shows the percent- ages for each method calculated on the total number of suicides. This is given chiefly because it presents the statistics in the way most fre- quently adopted by writers on the subject, not only in regard to the methods of suicide, but also in regard to the sexes, ages, occupations, and other details. It leaves out of account, however, the proportion to population, which should never be lost sight of; and its too frequent use has led to important misconceptions. For example, Morselli, founding on such figures, states that the number of suicides by cutting and stabbing is greater in Italy than in France, though a glance at the rates per million of population shows that such suicides occur more than twice as often in France. Sex and Age.—Men commit suicide more frequently than women, except at the period of adolescence, when the frequency is about equal. Between the ages of 20 and 35 there are in Eng- land and Scotland an average of about 2 males to 1 female, between 35 and 65 about 3 males to 1 female, and over 65 about 4 males to 1 female. Both male and female rates rise as age advances, and reach their maximum in most countries between the ages of 45 and 65, the male rates in England and Scotland being then between 250 and 300, and the female rates between 80 and 90. In some countries, such as England and Scotland, the male suicides exceed the female in the proportion of less than 3 to I ; but in other countries it is more than 4 to 1. Two illustrations may be given here of the errors arising from using percentages on the total number of suicides. Legoyt, founding on a statement showing that 27 per cent of the suicides are committed by women, says that it is in England "que les femmes se tuent le plus," though the number of suicides by women per , million of the female population in England is \ only 36 ; and the corresponding rates are for ■ Prussia 70, for Denmark 110, and for Saxony 130. In the same way, Morselli says that the Spanish women " commit more suicide than any other Europeans," though the figures on which he bases the statement give only 10 female suicides per million of the female popu- lation. Occupation.—Dr. Ogle has given, in a paper on suicide in England and Wales, the most useful statistics that we possess bearing on the relation between suicide and occupation. He avoided many of the complications which tend to obscure the issue, by restricting his investigation to males, and to those only between twenty-five and sixty-five years of age, when the influence of occupation is most strongly felt. The inquiry covered six years, 1878-83. The results showed that, as a general rule, the more an occupation involves hard physical labour the lower is its

218 SLEEP, NORMAL AND MORBID cases of insomnia, and I have seen good results from the use of prolonged baths for periods of as long as eight hours' duration. Sometimes the addition of a little mustard to the bath may be beneficial.

I have frequently observed good effects from the use of massage to the muscles of the occiput, neck, and spine, applied for twenty minutes when the patient is in bed and ready for sleep. Diet is important, and in the chronic in- sane a liberal diet does much to ensure sleep and rest. Pos- ture is some- times at fault, and not infre- quently there is even during sleep some muscular tension due to a somewhat strained atti- tude. Flaccidity and immobility ought to be sought for, and efforts made to counteract rest- lessness which stimulates the muscular and cutaneous senses and tends to rouse consciousness. With regard to hypnosis there is much differ- ence of opinion, and it is doubtful how far artificially induced hypnosis is really conducive to refreshing sleep and restoration of exhausted tissues. In agitated states where there is great motor excitement, and especially in agitated melancholia, tlie use of the dry or wet pack is attended by good results. Psychologically con- sidered, the grosser emotions are often mainly consequent upon or secondary to the violent expression of the emotion, i.e. the emotion itself is derived from the reaction to an imaginary or real exciting cause. It is rational, therefore, to check or control the violence of this reaction by artificial means, and it is a well- known fact in the treatment of mental diseases that by control- ling the motor excitement its consequent oi* correspond i n g emotion ceases. Thus it is that the employment of a wet or dry pack in agitated melancholia has a beneficial effect. When the rational treatment of insane states is more fully and better considered, it will probably be recog- nised that just as rest, natural or artificial, i& necessary in the treatment of bodily pain, sck rest, natural or artificial, is necessary in the treatment of mental pain.

The use of hy2motics, to try to imitate th& natural condition of sleep by effecting a lowered intracranial pressure, or narcotics, to cause unconsciousness irrespective of diminished pres- sure, is a source of constant perplexity to the physician. Of the various drugs used, space permits me to mention only briefly the bromides of potassium, sodium, ammonium, lithium, cal- cium, strontium, rubidium, csesium, also feri'ic

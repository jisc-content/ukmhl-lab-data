The pa- tient died on July 3rd, the eleventh day of illness,, practically at the com mencement of pustulation. The course of the tem- perature whilst under observa- tion is shown on the chart. Case II. — Sarah P , aged 12 ; unvac- cinated.—The whole course of the disease in this case was mild, secondarj'^ fever- lasting onlyabout eight days, as in- dicated by the chart. The tem- perature having regained the normal, convales- cence was unin- terrupted. Case III.— Jane W , aged 22; unvac- cinated.—The case derives inter- est from the cir- cumstance that the patient came under observa- tion on the first day of illness, and the course of the temperature is consequently re- corded from the commencement to the termina- tion. The disease took the conflu- ent form, was- attended with Case II.

It is impossible to remove and isolate all of them, and indeed it is quite unnecessary that such a thing should be attempted. Care, intelligence, and tact must be exercised in the matter, and it is not difficult to keep the people under observation without rendering that •observation in any way irksome. The following table (X) is interesting, showing the number of cases of smallpox imported into Liverpool during each of the last twenty years, also the number of patients in the city during that period, and the proportion removed to hospital. Table Y shows the cases and deaths during a longer period. (X) Smallpox in Liverpool, 1881 to 1901. Year. Imported by Sea or Overland. Reported in the City. Removed to Hospital.

There is no specific treatment to be adopted with a view to cutting short the attack, and the progress and severity of the illness will depend altogether upon the efficiency of the vaccination the patient may have undergone, and the time which has elapsed since its performance. A careful treatment of symptoms upon general principles will do much towards mitigating the suffering and promoting the recovery of the patient. From the commencement the patient should be kept in an airy and well-ventilated ward, the temperature of which is maintained at about 60° to 65° Fahr. It is a not uncomnion practice to use mattresses of coir fibre, or some material which can be frequently burnt and re- newed ; horse-hair, however, will be found to be most comfortable; the bedding must not be excessive, the comfort of the patient being the guide. The diet must be one suitable to the patient's febrile condition, and drinks such as (Y) Smallpox, 1865 to 1901. Years 01 In- crease. No. of Cases. Deaths. Years 01 Sub- sidence. No. of Cases.

Sleeplessness may be met by bromide of potassium ; morphia or chloral must be used with caution, and with careful regard to the patient's condition; in excessive or violent delirium, with flushed face and bounding pulse, the combination of antimonial with the sedative is valuable, but preliminary to their administra- tion the bowels should be well opened by an

September 5, 1908. vi EDITOUIAL NOTE Sphenocephalus, Spinthariscope, Squill, Staphylococcus, Stenosis, Stinging Insects and Plants, Stovaine, Stramonium, Streptococci, Stria, Strophanthus, Strychnine, Stypticine, Styptol, Sued, Sulphonal, Sulphur, Sulphuric and Sulphurous Acid, Sulphuric Ether, Suppository, Surgeon, Sweating, Sycosis, Tabaci Folia, Tabes, Tannic Acid, Tar, Telegony, and Thalamencephalon. The remaining 1413 subject headings are mostly of the nature of definitions, short explana- tory paragraphs, and cross references; they are very numerous in this volume, for as the Encyclo- pedia nears its end there is more and more necessity for referencing back to previous volumes. A few of the many matters referred to under these 1413 rubrics may be named here in order to give some idea of the range of this part of the work: Rhinorrhcea, Rhombencephalon, Rhonchus, Rosette Body, Rossbach's Disease, Row's Test, Rubber Gloves, Scaphoid, Schatz's Method, Schenck's Method, Schmidt's Test, Scillism, Sclerodactyly, Scolex, Screiv Wor?n, Segregator, Semester, Senator's Phlegmon, Septic Tank, Seiver Gas, Skatol, Skutsch's Pelvimeter, Smoke Test, Specialism, Spherocephalus, etc. In the Editorial Note to the next volume of this work I hope to be able to announce the approximate date of publication of the Quinquennium of Medicine, now in active preparation, which is intended to serve as a Supplementary Volume to this Encyclopedia as well as to the Encyclopaedia Medica.

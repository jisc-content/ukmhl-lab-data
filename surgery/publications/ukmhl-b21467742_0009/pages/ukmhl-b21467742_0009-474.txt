Historical.—The history of syphilis has been investigated more thoroughly than that of any other affection. Its earlier records are obscure, and for all practical purposes it appeared as a new disease in Europe in 1494, though it had long been recognised in the New World, and there is but little doubt that the Spaniards who sailed with Columbus in his first voyage became infected, and thus introduced it into the Old World at a most convenient opportunity for its wide distribution. Vigo (1460-1517'?), writing as a contemporary, says: " In the month of December, when Charles the French King took his journey into the parts of Italy to recover the kingdom of Naples, there appeared a certain disease throughout all Italy of an unknown character, which sundry nations hath called by sundry names. The Frenchmen call it the disease of Naples, because the soldiers brought it from thence into France. The Neapolitans call it the French disease, for it appeared first when they came to Naples." In the end it became known as Morbus Gallicus, which the common people shortened to Morbus. In its first appearance it was epidemic, and as neither the mode of infection nor the method of cure was recognised, it spread with such rapidity that on the 21st April 1497 the Town Council of Aberdeen issued the following order: " The said day it was statut and ordanit be the Alderman and Consale (Council) for the eschewin of the infirmitey cumm out of Franche and strange partis, that all licht wemen be chargit and ordanit to decist fra thar vices and syne of venerie and all thar buthes and housis skalit, and thai to pass and wirk for thar sustentacioun, under the payne of ane key of het yrne one thair cheekis and banysene of the toune." Mr. Alexander Duncan, who quotes this edict, points out that it has an interest apart from its being the earliest notice of the presence of syphilis in Scotland, because before 1500 no medical writer on the subject had even hinted that it had any connection with the "syne of venerie." Yet, here in this northern Scottish burgh, the astute municipal authorities had anticipated conclusions subsequently come to by the faculty. In Scotland, too, syphilis was known as "Gleiigore" or "Granggore," a word coiTupted from the French Grandgore, d la grande gorre, the local name for the disease at Rouen, as we learn from Rabelais {Panta- gruel, v. xxi.). Six months after the Aberdeen edict the Scottish Privy Council issued the "Grangore Act," which ordered all the inhabit- ants of Edinburgh affected with the disease to pass out of the town and to appear upon the sands of Leith on a stated day and hour, thence to be conveyed by boat to the island of Inch- keith.

SMALLPOX 231 child has aggravated it by rubbing the clothing against it, an ashy grey ulcerated surface, not unlike that produced by a burn, larger in area perhaps, and certainly more superficial than the eruptive pock in modified smallpox. The coexistence of the various stages of the eruption will also be noted. In almost all smallpox outbreaks, numerous instances come under notice in which the small- pox patient has sought the protection of vaccina- tion some time after exposure to infection, and had been vaccinated at some period during the stage of incubation of smallpox. This circum- stance has given rise to the not uncommon cases in which vaccinia and modified smallpox are concurrent, that is to say, cases in which the vaccination runs its course, more or less in the normal way, at the same time that the patient is passing through a modified attack of smallpox. The important question arises as to whether or not it is of use to vaccinate a person after a certain number of days have elapsed since his exposure to infection. As a matter of routine practice, every person so exposed ought certainly to be re-vaccinated at the earliest opportunity, and if that vaccination takes place within three days the patient will probably be altogether pro- tected. If, on the other hand, the vaccination has been delayed for from between the second to the eighth day, the probability is that the attack will be modified, but after nine days it is too late, and the protection cannot be relied upon. There is, however, something more to be said upon this extremely interesting question. Dr. Roberts, of the City Smallpox Hospital, as a routine practice, vaccinated 200 patients admitted to the smallpox hospital between the second and sixth days of illness. Two of these cases who were vaccinated before the eruption appeared had concurrent vaccinia and modified smallpox. Two others, vaccinated on the second day of the eruption, ultimately developed vac- cination vesicles, the smallpox running a very modified course. These were the only results obtained out of the 200 experimented upon. It is generally accepted that cases of doubtful diagnosis in which vaccination has been suc- cessfully performed are cases of some illness other than smallpox; but in the cases noted there is no doubt as to the diagnosis, and indeed similar incidents have occurred during most of the extensive outbreaks.

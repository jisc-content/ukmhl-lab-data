128 SENSATION " tertiary level " occurs. It will be noted that the impulses which recombine—thermal, pain- ful, and tactile—cross to the opposite side of the cord, the first two rapidly, the third more slowly; position and tactile discrimination are not recombined, and do not cross in the cord, but pass up in the long extrinsic fibres of the posterior columns of the same side. Some or all ultimately cross at the level of the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus, but it may be that those which subserve equilibration, and do not cross the threshold of consciousness, enter the same side of the cerebellum without ever undergoing decussation. This conception of the sensory mechanism may be schematically indicated thus :— AFFERENT IMPULSES IN Peripheral Nerves. Muscular and Ar- ticular Nerves. 2 PRESSURE.

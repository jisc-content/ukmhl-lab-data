I. Nomenclature.—Scarlet fever; scarlatina; febris rubra ; scarlatine ; Scharlachfieber. II. Definition.—A zymotic disease charac- terised by a hypersemic exanthem of a puncti- forni character, diffused more or less over the entire surface of the body, which appears on the second day. It is preceded by an inflam- mation of the fauces, and followed by general desquamation. It is attended by fever and nervous symptoms; and the joints, serous membranes, glands, kidneys, and the subcutan- eous areolar tissue are frequently involved. The entire disease is the exhibition of an infection of the organism by a specific bacillus, termed the streptococcus conglomeratus. III. History.—Hirsch furnishes the first account of the disease as emanating from Sicily in 1543 ; while Ingrassias of Palermo described it in 1556. In the beginning of the seventeenth century Sennert refers to scarlet fever as another form of measles. But it was not until the sixth decade of the seventeenth century that Sydenham definitely established the dis- tinction between scarlet fever and measles. He was followed by Morton, who, at the close of the same century, again maintained the identity of the two diseases, with a differentiation only in respect of the character of the exanthem. Since that date scarlet fever has been regarded as a distinct disease. From Western Europe, where it apparently originated, it has been constantly existent in sporadic cases, becoming epidemic from time to time, but without any regular periodicity. By means of the personal intercourse which commerce involves the dis- ease has been conveyed to other countries.

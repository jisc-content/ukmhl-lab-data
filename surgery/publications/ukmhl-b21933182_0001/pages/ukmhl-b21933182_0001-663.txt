ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS. 639 The patient may first apply for advice on account of the symptoms of loose body. The treatment applicable to this type is the removal of the hypertrophied fringes or of the loose body by open arthrotomy, and is usually successful. The dry form of arthritis deformans (arthritis sicca), although especially common in the knee, is met with frequently in other joints, either as a mon-articular or poly-articular disease; and it is also very common in the joints of the spine and of the fingers, as well as in the temporo-maxillary joint. In the joints of the fingers in older patients the disease is remarkably sym- metrical, and tends to assume a nodular type (Heberden’s nodes) (Fig. 213); whereas in younger individuals it assumes a more crippling, painful, and progressive fusiform type (Fig. 214). Tn the larger joints the subjective symptoms Fig. 213.—Arthritis Deformans of Hands, showing symmetry of lesions, ulnar deviation of fingers, and nodular thickening at interphalaugeal joints. usually precede any palpable evidence of disease. The patient complains of stiffness, crackings, and aching, aggravated by changes in the weather and by rest. The roughness due to fibrillation of the articular cartilages may be appreciated by coarse friction on movement of the joint. It may be many months or years before the lipping and other hypertrophic changes in the ends of the bones are recognisable, and before the joint assumes the deformed features which have given the disease its name. These are referred to under the individual joints. As regards the progress of the disease, it is usually observed that in patients who are still young its tendency is to advance with considerable rapidity, so that in the course of a few months it may cause serious crippling of several joints. In older patients its progress is much more gradual. The disease is quite compatible with long life.

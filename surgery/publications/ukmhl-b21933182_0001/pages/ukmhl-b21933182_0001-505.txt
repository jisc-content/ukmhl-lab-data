481 INJURIES OF THE FINGERS. towards the dorsum of the hand. Apart from this there is little deformity, as the adjacent metacarpals act as natural splints and tend to retain the fragments in apposition. A sudden sharp pain may be elicited at the seat of fracture on making pressure in the long axis of the finger; and unnatural mo- bility and crepitus may usually be detected by manipulation of the fragments. These fractures are readily recognised by the X-rays. Firm union usually results in three or four weeks. Treatment.—When the fracture is transverse, and especially when it implicates the middle or ring Ungers, the most convenient method of treatment is to make the patient grasp a firm pad, such as a roller bandage covered with a layer of wool, and fix the closed fist by a figure-of-eight bandage (Fig. 128). In this way the adjoining metacarpals are utilised as lateral splints. To prevent the extensor tendon forming attachments to the broken bone, active and passive movements must be carried out daily, and the bandage may be removed at the end of a fortnight. In oblicpie frac- tures with a tendency to overriding of the fragments, especially in the case of the index and little fingers, it is some- times necessary to apply extension to the distal segment of the digit, by means of adhesive plaster, to which elastic tubing is attached and fixed to the end of a rectangular splint reaching well beyond the finger tips (Fig. 129) (Chiene). This should be worn for three weeks, passive movement being carried out after the first week.

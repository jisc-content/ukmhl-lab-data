526 INJURIES IN REGION OF KNEE AND LEG. panied by laceration of the lateral expansions of the quadriceps tendon, the limb may be placed upon an inclined plane, to relax the quadriceps muscle, or in a Croft’s or box splint extending well up the thigh. Massage should be carried out from the first, special care being taken, by moving it transversely, to prevent the patella forming adhesions with the front of the femur. Wharton Hood recommends that the patient should be kept in bed for a day or two, the injured region being massaged daily. About the fourth day a strip of adhesive plaster, three inches wide, is applied so as to encircle the thigh in the lower third. The patient is then allowed to use the limb with caution. No attempt is made to approximate the fragments, as, according Fig. 162.—Treatment of Fracture of Patella by means of Inclined Plane and Elastic Extension. to Hood, fibrous union does not entail any interference with the utility of the limb. The majority of surgeons, however, aim at bringing the fragments into apposition, and endeavour to secure osseous union if possible. When the fragments are separated by more than three- quarters of an inch, and circumstances forbid operative treat- ment being adopted, the limb should be placed upon an inclined plane to relax the quadriceps muscle, and means taken to arrest effusion and to diminish the swelling of the joint by systematic massage and a supporting bandage. When, in the course of a few days, this has been accomplished, an attempt is made to approximate the fragments. This is done by fixing a large horse-shoe shaped piece of adhesive plaster to the front of the thigh, embracing the upper fragment. Ex- tension is made upon this by means of rubber tubing, which is

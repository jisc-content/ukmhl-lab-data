460 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. applied from the fingers to the level of the axillary fold, the turns covering the elbow being applied in the form of a con- vergent spica to approximate the fragments. A Gooch splint, extending from the lower border of the axilla to the finger tips, and cut to the shape of the extended limb (Fig. Ill), is then applied anteriorly and fixed in position by a bandage, the Igllliiiil region of the elbow „ TT , , , . , .v .

When the displacement is great, the frag- ments may be approximated by fixing a horse- shoe-shaped piece of adhesive plaster (Fig. 112) Fig.111.—Gooch to the back of the arm so that it embraces the Splint for upper fragment, and attaching to it a piece of J-ct^of strong elastic tubing, to be fixed to the lower end of the anterior splint, which must be made to project an inch or two beyond the tips of the fingers (Fig. 113). Another method is to fix the elastic to the cuff of a strong dogskin glove applied to the hand. The apparatus must be worn for about a month, massage and movement being commenced during the course of the first week; great care is necessary to avoid separation of the fragments while this is being done. When the fracture has been treated by prolonged immobilisation, and Note “carry- ing angle.” massage has not been e m p 1 o ye d, stiffness of the joint frequen 11 y persists for a consider- able time. Operative Treatment.—A semilunar incision with its base’above the tip of the olecranon is carried through the skin and fascia. The fracture is exposed, the joint cavity opened up and cleared of clots, and silver-wire or fishing-gut sutures passed through Fig. 113. —Auterior Splint, with Extension by means of Adhesive Plaster and Elastic Tubing for Fracture of Olecranon.

SURGICAL FEVERS DUE TO BACTERIA. 63 The pulse is small, feeble, and compressible, and the temperature rises in the afternoon or evening to 102° or 103° F. (Fig. 2), the cheeks becoming characteristically flushed. In the early morning the temperature suddenly falls to normal or below it, and the patient breaks into a profuse perspiration which leaves him pale, weak, and exhausted. He becomes rapidly and markedly emaciated (Fig. 11), even although in some cases the appetite remains good and is even voracious. The poisons circulating in the blood produce waxy degenera- tion in certain viscera, notably the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines. The process begins in the arterial walls and spreads thence to the connective-tissue structures, causing marked en- largement of the affected organs. Albuminuria, ascites, oedema Fig. 11.—Extreme Emaciation accompanying Hectic Fever secondary to Sacro-iliac Disease in a boy aged 8, who subsequently recovered. of the lower limbs, clubbing of the Angers, and diarrhoea are among the most prominent symptoms of this condition. The prognosis in hectic fever depends on the completeness with which the further absorption of toxins can be prevented. In many cases this can only be effected by an operation which provides for free drainage, and, if possible, the removal of infected tissues. The resulting wound is best treated by the open method. Even advanced waxy degeneration does not contra- indicate this line of treatment, as the diseased organs usually recover when the patient survives the operation. Sweating, diarrhoea, albuminuria, and the other special symptoms are to be met by medical means. Septicsemia.—This form of septic poisoning is the result of the action of pyogenic bacteria, which not only produce their toxins at the primary seat of infection, but themselves enter the blood-stream and are carried to different viscera, where they settle and produce further effects.

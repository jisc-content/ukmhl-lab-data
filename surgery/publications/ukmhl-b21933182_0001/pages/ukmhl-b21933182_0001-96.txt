72 ULCERATION AND ULCERS. of as the varicose ulcer (Fig. 12). Any slight injury or irritation of the devitalised area is liable to permit of septic infection and lead to ulceration. Dermatitis and eczema are common in associa- tion with varicose veins, and the scratching or rubbing of the part is very liable to break the surface and permit of infection. Such ulcers may also originate in the bursting of a small peri-plilebitic abscess. Varicose veins in immediate relation to the base of a large chronic ulcer usually become thrombosed, and in time are reduced to fibrous cords, and therefore in such cases haemorrhage is not a com- mon complication. In smaller and more super- ficial ulcers, however, the destructive process is liable to implicate thewall of the vessel before the occurrence of thrombosis, and to lead to profuse and often dangerous bleeding. These ulcers are at first small and superficial, but from want of care, from continued standing or walking, or from injudicious treat- ment, they gradually become larger and deeper. They are not infre- quently multiple, and this, together with their depth, may lead to their being mistaken for syphilitic ulcers. The base of the ulcer is covered with imperfectly-formed, soft, cedematous granulations, which give off a thin sero-purulent discharge. The edges show signs of slight inflammation, and no evidence of healing. The parts around are usually pigmented and slightly oede- matous, and as a rule there is little pain. This variety of ulcer is particularly prone to pass into the condition known as callous. In ancemic patients, especially young girls, ulcers are occa- sionally met with which have many of the clinical characters of those associated with imperfect venous return. They are very slow to heal, and tend to pass into the condition known as weak. Fig. 13.â€”Trophic Ulcers of Fingers following Division of Median Nerve above Wrist.

437 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. A general anaesthetic is an invaluable' aid to speedy and accurate reduction, and should always be given unless there is some reason for withholding it. It is clearly indicated in strong, muscular subjects, and particularly when the dislocation is of some standing, and in nervous patients who do not bear pain well. In quite recent cases, however, the surgeon may sometimes succeed in replacing the bone by taking advantage of a temporary faintness, or by engaging the patient’s attention with other matters while lie carries out the appropriate manipulations. Fig. 99.—Kocher’s Method—Second Move- ment: Elbow carried forward, upward, and towards the Middle Line. Fig. 100. — Kocher’s Method — Third Movement: Inward Rota- tion of Arm. When an anaesthetic is employed the patient should be laid on a mattress on the floor, or on a narrow, firm table ; otherwise he should be seated on a chair. Kocher’s method is suitable for the great majority of cases of sub-coracoid dislocation. (1) The elbow is firmly pressed against the side, and the forearm flexed to a right angle. The surgeon grasps the wrist and elbow and firmly rotates the arm outward (Fig. 98) till distinct resistance is felt and the deltoid becomes more prominent. In this way the rent in the lower part of the capsule is made to gape, and the head of the humerus rolls out- wards till it lies opposite the opening, rotation taking place

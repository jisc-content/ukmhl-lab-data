598 DISEASES OF BONE. growths presenting a similar giant - celled structure, these tumours are, as a rale, innocent, and should be treated as such, either by shelling out the new growth from the marrow, or by resecting the portion of bone in which the tumour is lodged. Fig. 202.—The Femur of a boy set. 12, showing the Bony Shell of a large Cyst-like Cavity which com- municates with the interior of the bone. The original tumour was probably a sarcoma. (The specimen, which is in the Ana- tomical Museum, University of Edin- burgh, is figured in Syme’s Principles of Surgery.) The myeloid tumours of the jaw will be described with the diseases of the jaws. The sarcomata are the com- monest tumours of bone, and present wide variations in struc- ture and in clinical features. Structurally, two main groups may be differentiated : the soft, rapidly-growing cellular tumours, and those which are char- acterised by the formation of fully formed fibrous tissue, cartilage or bone. The soft cellular tumours are mainly composed of spindle or round cells; they grow chiefly from the marrow of the spongy ends of the long bones, the diploe of the skull, the pelvis, vertebrae, and jaws. In the process of growth they may cause

294 THE BLOOD-VESSELS. The pain, stiffness, and effusion into the joint which accompany these changes often lead to an erroneous diagnosis. It may press upon the popliteal vein, causing congestion and oedema of the leg, which may end in gangrene. Pressure on the popliteal nerves gives rise to severe pain, muscular cramp, and weakness of the leg. The differential diagnosis is to be made from aneurysm, abscess, bursal cyst, enlarged glands, and sarcoma. The choice of operation lies between ligature of the femoral artery in Hunterâ€™s canal, and the old operation. The success which attends the Hunterian operation is evidenced by the fact that Syme performed it thirty-seven times without a single failure. Of recent years, however, the old operation has again come into favour, largely through the advocacy of Annandale and others. Experience shows that ligature of the vein, or even the removal of a portion of it, is not necessarily followed by gangrene if the wound remains aseptic. The onset of gangrene from any cause is an indication for immediate amputation. Aneurysmal varix is sometimes met with in the region of the popliteal space. It is characterised by the usual symptoms, and is treated by palliative measures, or by ligature of the artery above and below the point of communication. Aneurysm in the leg and foot is rare. It is almost always traumatic, and is best treated by excision of the sac.

THE BURSAE. 380 adventitious bursa-; are met with. That over the tuberosity of Fig. 75.—Great Enlargement of the Ischial Bursa. (Mr. Scot Skirving’s case.) the ischium when enlarged as a trade r’o ” disease is known as weaver's " or “ tailor’s bottom.” It may form a fluctuating] swelling of great size, projecting on the buttock and extending down the thigh, and causing great inconvenience in sitting (Fig. 75). There are two bursae over the great trochanter, one superficial to and one beneath the aponeurosis of the gluteus maximus ; the latter is not infrequently infected by tuberculous disease spreading from the trochanter. ^ Disease of the bursa between the psoas and the capsule of the liip-joint is associated with clinical features not unlike those of hip disease. The limb may be flexed, abducted and rotated out, and there is a distinct swelling in the upper part of Scarpa’s triangle. The bursa beneath the quadriceps extensor — subcrural bursa — usually communicates freely with the knee- joint and shares in its diseases. When shut off from the knee it may suffer independently, and when distended with fluid forms a horse-shoe swelling above the patella (Fig. 76). Fig. 76.—Bilateral Hydrops of Subcrural Bursa. (Mr. F. M. Caird’s case.)

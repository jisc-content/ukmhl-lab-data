178 CHAPTER XI. TUMOURS.1 Definition — Etiology — General characters of innocent and malignant tumours. Classification of Tumours : I. Connective - tissue tumours: (i) Innocent: Lipoma, Chondroma, Osteoma, Odontoma, Fibroma, Myxoma, etc. ; (2) Malignant: Sarcoma—II. Epithelial tumours: (1) Innocent: Papilloma, Adenoma, Cystic Adenoma; (2) Malignant: Epithelioma, Glandular Cancer, Rodent Cancer, Melanotic Cancer—III. Dermoids—IV. Teratomata. Cysts : Reten- tion, Exudation, Implantation, Parasitic, Lymphatic or Serous. Ganglion. A tumour or neoplasm is a localised swelling composed of newly-formed tissue which fulfils no physiological function. Tumours tend to grow continuously and quite independently of the growth of the body, and there is no natural termination to their growth. They are to be distinguished from such over- growths of already-existing parts of the body as are of the nature of hypertrophies or local giantism, and from inflammatory swellings, which usually develoji under the influence of a definite cause, which have a natural termination, and which tend to disappear when the cause ceases to act. The etiology of tumours is at present very imperfectly under- stood. Various factors, acting either singly or in combination, may be concerned in jtheir development. Certain tumours, for example, are the result of some congenital malformation of the particular tissue from which they take origin. This would appear to be the case in many angiomata, chondromata, osteomata, and adenomata. The theory that tumours originate from foetal residues or “ rests ” is associated with the name of Cohnlieim. These rests are supposed to be undifferentiated embryonic cells which remain embedded amongst fully-formed tissue elements, 1 For the histology of tumours the reader is referred to a text-book of pathology.

574 DISEASES OF BONE. Fio. 187.—The Metatarsal and Phalangeal Bones of a Great Toe, showing destructive changes in tuberculous dac- tylitis. denser and heavier than the normal bone, and which separates very slowly. Such sequestra may be concerned in the production of the more serious and persistent forms of tuberculous disease in joints (Fig. 191). Clinical Features.—It is only in superficially placed bones such as the tibia, ulna, clavicle, lower jaw, or phalanges, that tuberculous disease in the marrow gives rise to signs suffici- ently definite to allow of its clinical recognition. In the vertebrae, or in the constituent bones of deeply-seated joints, such as the hip or shoulder, the existence of tuberculous lesions in the marrow may only be inferred from indirect signs—such, for example, as rigidity and curvature in the case of the spine, or from the symptoms of grave and persistent joint-disease in the case of the hip or shoulder. From Mr. Annandate’s collection.) There is evidence to show that tuber- culous lesions in the marrow may remain latent for indefinite periods. With few exceptions, tuberculous disease in the interior of a bone does not reveal its presence, until by extension it reaches one or other of the surfaces of the bone. In the shafts of long bones its eruption on the peri- osteal surface is usually followed by the forma- tion of a cold abscess in the overlying soft parts. When situated in the articular ends of bones, the disease more often erupts in relation to the reflection of the synovial membrane or directly on the articular surface—in either case giving rise to disease of the joint.

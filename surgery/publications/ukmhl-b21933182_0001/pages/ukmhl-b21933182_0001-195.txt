171 INHERITED SYPHILIS. grows up the bridge of the nose is deficient, the condition being known as the “ saddle-nose ” deformity (Fig. 28). Affections of the Skin.—Although all types of syphilitic eruption are met with in the inherited disease, the most important is a papular or papulosquamous rash, the papules being of large size, with a smooth shining top and of a reddish- brown colour. It chiefly affects the buttocks and posterior aspect of the thighs, the external genitals, and other parts which are kejit moist; but, inasmuch as the same parts are liable to eczema in non-syphilitic infants, attention should be directed in diagnosis to the infiltration of the skin and to the coppery colour of the specific eruption. At the angles of the mouth and at the anus the papules acquire the characters of condy- lomata, which are of great importance in the recognition of syphilis in doubtful cases (Fig. 29). At the angles of the mouth they often ulcerate and leave fine radiating scars (Fig. 28). Affections of the Mu- cous Membranes. — In addition to the rhinitis already described as causing snuffles, there may be mucous patches in the mouth, or a general inflammation or stomatitis, which is of special importance because it frequently results in inter- ference with the development of the permanent teeth. Mucous patches or catarrh of the larynx may be associated with a hoarse cry. Affections of the bones are by no means constant. There may be swellings at the ends of the long bones due to inflammation at the epiphysial junctions, most often observed at the upper end of the humerus, or in the bones in the region of the elbow. The infant cries when the part is touched ; and as it does not move the limb voluntarily, the condition is often spoken of as Fig. 28.- -Facies of Inherited Syphilis in a girl aged 20.

25 CHAPTER III. METHODS OF WOUND TREATMENT. Varieties of wounds—Modes of infection—Lister’s work—Means taken to prevent infection of wounds: heat; chemical antiseptics; disinfection of hands ; instruments ; ligatures; dressings— Means taken to combat septic infection: purification; open-wound method. The presence of pyogenic bacteria being the most important factor interfering with the process of repair in wounds, it is necessary that we should now consider the means at our dis- posal for preventing or counteracting the baneful effects of these organisms. The surgeon is called upon to treat two distinct classes of wounds: (1) those resulting from injury or disease in which the skin is already broken, or in which a communication with a mucous surface exists; and (2) those which he himself makes through intact skin, no infected mucous surface being involved. Infection by bacteria must be assumed to have taken place in all wounds made in any other way than by the knife of the surgeon operating through unbroken skin. On this assumption the modern antiseptic system of wound treatment is based. Pathogenic bacteria are so widely distributed that in the ordinary circumstances of everyday life, no matter how trivial a wound may be, or how short a time it may remain exposed, the access of organisms to it is almost certain, unless definite means are employed to prevent it. It cannot be emphasised too strongly that rigid antiseptic precautions are to be adopted, not only in dealing with wounds which are free of organisms, but equally in the management of wounds and other lesions which are already infected. Any laxity in our methods which admits of fresh organisms reaching an infected wound adds materially to the severity of the septic process and consequently to the patient’s risk.

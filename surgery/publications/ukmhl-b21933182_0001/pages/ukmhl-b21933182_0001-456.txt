432 INJURIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. In the forward dislocation the head of the bone lies on the front of the sternum, somewhat below the level of the sterno- clavicular joint (Fig. 95), the interarticular cartilage sometimes remaining attached to one bone, sometimes to the other, while the rhomboid ligament usually remains intact. AY hen the head passes backward the joint cavity is felt to be empty, a marked hollow existing in this position, and the end of the clavicle lies behind the manubrium sterni and the muscles attached to it. In a comparatively small number of cases it exerts pressure upon the trachea and oesophagus, producing difficulty in breath- ing and swallowing. It has also been known to press upon the subclavian artery and on other important structures at the root of the neck. In very rare cases the rhomboid ligament being torn, the end of the clavicle passes upward, and rests in the episternal notch behind the sterno- mastoid muscle, i Dislocation of both ends of the clavicle has occasion- ally occurred from a severe crush. The results have been satisfactory, as one or other end has always united in normal position, and the function of the arm has thus been maintained. Clinical Features.—In all varieties the clinical features are so well marked that the diagnosis is unmistakable. The head inclines towards the affected side, and the shoulder tends to pass slightly downward, forward, and inward. The displaced end of the bone can be seen and felt as a subcutaneous prominence (Figs. 94 and 95), or the empty socket can be palpated, while the muscles attached’ to the displaced clavicle stand out in relief. The movements of the shoulder are always restricted, Fig. 95.—Forward Dislocation of Sternal End of Right Clavicle.

462 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. Fracture of the neck of the radius between the capsule and the tubercle is extremely rare, as is also separation of the upper epiphysis. These injuries are treated in the flexed position, and massage and movement are carried out as already described. Dislocations of the Elbow. Dislocations of the elbow-joint may involve one or both bones of the forearm, and the separation may be complete or incomplete. Dislocation of both bones backward is the most common of all dislocations of the elbow, and is the only dislocation in the body which is frequently met with in children. It usually results from a fall on the outstretched hand, causing hyper-extension and abduction of the joint—that is, lateral deviation towards the radial side ; but it may follow a direct blow on the back of the humerus, a fall on the elbow, or a twist of the forearm. Morbid Anatomy.—The an- terior and lateral ligaments of the elbow are torn, while the posterior and orbicular liga- ments remain intact. The radius and ulna pass back, the coronoid process coming to rest opposite the olecranon fossa behind the humerus, and the head of the radius behind the external condyle. The condyles of the humerus bear their normal relations to one another. The olecranon process and triceps tendon form a marked prominence on the back of the elbow, the tip of the olecranon lying above and behind the condyles. The lower end of the humerus lies in the flexure of the joint with the biceps tendon tightly stretched over it. The coronoid process is often broken, or the tendon of the brachialis anticus torn. The median and ulnar nerves are generally stretched and may even be torn.

CAPILLARY ANGIOMA. 269 The application of escharotics has but a limited field of use- fulness. They may be employed with benefit in very small nsevi occurring on the face. A pointed piece of wood is dipped in strong nitric acid, and then thrust into the centre of the nsevoid spot. For large nsevi the choice lies between electrolysis and excision—the former method being selected when the nsevus is on an exposed part of the body, where it is desirable to avoid a scar ; the latter when it is on a part covered by the clothes. Electrolysis acts by decomposing the blood and tissues into Fig. 50.—Electrolysis of Nsevus under Chloroform Ausesthesia. their constituent elements—oxygen and acids appearing at the positive, hydrogen and bases at the negative electrode. These substances and gases being given off in a nascent condition, at once enter into new combinations with anything in the vicinity with which they have a chemical affinity. In the nsevus the practical result of this reaction is that at the positive pole nitric acid, and at the negative pole caustic potash, both in a state of minute subdivision, make their appearance. The effect on the tissues around the positive pole, therefore, is equivalent to that of an acid cauterisation, and on those round the negative pole to an alkaline cauterisation.

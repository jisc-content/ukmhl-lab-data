CHAPTER XIX. 377 THE BURSAE. Anatomy—Normal and adventitious^bursae—Injuries : Bursal haematoma —Diseases : Traumatic or trade bursitis ; Bursal hydrops ; Solid bursal tumour ; Gonorrhceal and suppurative forms of bursitis ; Tuberculous and syphilitic disease—Tumours—Diseases of individual bursae in the upper and lower extremity. A bursa is a closed sac lined by endothelium and containing synovial fluid. Bursae occur where two surfaces rub against one another, and they serve to diminish friction. Some are normally present—for example, in front of the knee and over the point of the elbow. Others are developed in situations where undue pressure is applied—for example, in relation to deformities. Such adventitious bursas are common over the tarsal bones in certain cases of club-foot. The lining membrane of bursae resembles that of joints and tendon sheaths, and is liable to the same forms of disease. Injuries of Bursae.—As a result of contusion, haemorrhage may occur into the cavity of a bursa and give rise to a bursal haematoma. This is especially liable to occur in bleeders. Such a haematoma may mask a fracture of the bone beneath— for example, fracture of the olecranon process. Acute suppura- tion is a frequent sequel of infected wounds. Diseases of Bursae.—The various forms of inflammation met with in bursae correspond very closely to those occurring in tendon sheaths. Traumatic or “Trade” Bursitis.—This term maybe con- veniently employed to include certain affections of bursae which are characterised by an effusion of fluid into the cavity with more or less thickening of the lining membrane of the sac. While friction and pressure constitute the most prominent factors in its production, it is probable that there is also some toxic agent concerned, otherwise the affection would be much

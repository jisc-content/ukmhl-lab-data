714 THE DEFORMITIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. Lastly, deformities resembling talipes equino-varus may result from injuries in the region of the ankle, from joint affections, and from cicatricial changes following extensive burns and ulcers. The occurrence of varus without equinus is so exceptional as not to call for separate description. Pes Equinus.—This deformity con- sists in plantar-flexion of the foot so that in typical cases the patient walks on the balls of the toes (Fig. 249). It is nearly always acquired. It most commonly results from infantile or from spastic paralysis. In infantile paraly- sis it is most often unilateral (Fig. 250). If the muscles in front of the leg alone are paralysed the heel is drawn up by the unopposed contrac- tion of the calf muscles. If all the muscles of the leg are paralysed, the anterior part of the foot attitude by its Fig. 249. — Bilateral Pes Equinus in a boy set. 7, the result of spastic paralysis. equinus drops into the own weight. In spastic paralysis the deformity is frequently bilateral and is usually accom- panied by excessive arching of the foot (pes cavus) from plantar - flexion at the mid-tarsal joint, and by hyper-extension of the first phalanges and plantar-flexion of the second and third phalanges of the toes—clawing of the toes.” Among the less frequent causes of pes equinus mention may be made of nerve lesions such as peripheral neuritis, injuries and diseases in the region of the ankle where the foot has been allowed to remain for long periods in the attitude of plantar-flexion. In a limited number of cases, the equinus attitude is adopted by the patient in order to compensate for shortening of the limb.

Clinical Features.—In the mildest cases the patient is able to bring the foot to a right angle, and the condition is easily

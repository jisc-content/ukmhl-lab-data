According to cause : Traumatism, Imperfect circulation, Imperfect nerve-supply, Constitutional causes — B. Ac- cording to condition : Healing, Stationary, Spreading. — Treatment —Skin Grafting. The process of ulceration may be defined as the molecular or cellular death of tissue taking place on a free surface. It is essentially of the same nature as the process of suppuration, only that the purulent discharge, instead of collecting in a closed cavity and forming an abscess, at once escapes on the surface. An ulcer is an open wound or sore in which there are present certain conditions tending to prevent it undergoing the natural process of repair. Of these, one of the most important is the presence of pathogenic bacteria, which by their action not only prevent healing, but so irritate and destroy the tissues as to lead to an actual increase in the size of the sore. Interference with the nutrition of a part by oedema or venous congestion may impede healing; as may also induration of the area surrounding an ulcer, by preventing the contraction which is such an import- ant factor in repair. Defective innervation such as occurs in cases of spinal disease or injury, in infantile paralysis, and in other nervous conditions, also plays an important part in delay- ing repair in ulcers. In certain constitutional conditions too— for example, Bright’s disease, diabetes, or syphilis—the vitiated state of the tissues is an impediment to repair. Mechanical causes such as unsuitable dressings or ill-fitting appliances may also act in the same direction. Clinical Examination of an Ulcer.—In examining any ulcer we observe—(1) Its base or floor, noting the presence or absence of granulations, their disposition, size, colour, vascularity, and

The onset is frequently determined by some injury to the joint. The joints of the lower extremity are most commonly affected, and the disease is bilateral in a considerable proportion of cases—both knees or both hips, for instance, being implicated. The disease may assume a mild form in which the joint and its vicinity become swollen, either spontaneously or after some Fig. 215.—Bones of Knee-joint in advanced stage of Charcot’s Disease.

An atrophic and a hypertrophic type are distinguished according to whether the wearing away and disappearance of bone, or the exaggerated formation of new bone is the more prominent feature (Fig. 215). Sometimes, and especially in the knee, the clinical features are those of an enormous hydrops with fibrinous and other loose bodies and hypertrophied fringes—

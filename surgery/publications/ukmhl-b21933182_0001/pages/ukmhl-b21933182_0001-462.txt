438 INJURIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. about the fixed point formed by the contact of the anatomical neck of the humerus with the anterior lip of the glenoid cavity (Waterston). (2) The elbow is next carried forward, upward, and toward the middle line (Fig. 99), the humerus acting as the long arm of a lever on the fulcrum furnished by the muscles inserted in the region of the surgical neck ; the head, which forms the short arm of the lever, is carried backward, downward, and outward, and is thus directed towards the socket. (3) The arm is now rotated inward by carrying the hand across the chest Fig. 101.—Miller’s Method of reducing Sub-coracoid Dislocation—Second Movement. towards the opposite shoulder (Fig. 100). The anatomical neck of the humerus is thus disengaged from the edge of the glenoid, and the head is pulled into the socket by the tension of the surrounding muscles. A method of reduction has been formulated by Mr. A. G. Miller which is often efficacious. The limb is grasped above the wrist and elbow, the forearm flexed to a right angle, and the upper arm abducted to the horizontal. While an assistant makes counter-extension and fixes the scapula, the surgeon gradually draws the arm out from the body till the head of the humerus is felt to pass outwards. The humerus is then rotated

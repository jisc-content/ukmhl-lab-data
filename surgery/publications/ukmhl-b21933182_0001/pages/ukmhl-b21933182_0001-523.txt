FRACTURES OF THE NECK OF THE FEMUR, 490 union, and the third to correct or diminish displacements ” (Stimson). In old and debilitated patients prolonged confinement to bed in the dorsal attitude is liable to endanger life by favouring hypostatic congestion of the lungs and the formation of bed- sores. As bony or even firm fibrous union seldom takes place in these patients, especially when the fracture is through the narrow part of the neck, it is generally advisable to get them out of bed as speedily as possible. For the first few days the patient may be kept on his back, the limb being steadied by sand-bags ; but on the first sign of respiratory or cardiac trouble he should be propped up in bed, and as soon as possible lifted into a chair. The leg may be fixed in a Thomas’ hip splint, a leather case, or by a plaster-of-Paris spica applied to the hip, while he gets about on crutches or in a bath-chair. In all such cases care should be taken to avoid undoing impaction. In robust patients, on the other hand, there is no danger from prolonged immobilisation in bed, and as union without deformity can be attained in no other way this is always ad- visable. When the shortening and eversion are excessive they should be completely corrected under anaesthesia before the retentive apparatus is applied, any impaction which exists being undone. When the deformity resulting from impaction is slight, however, it is best to leave it, as it facilitates speedy and firm union. Shortening! is best counteracted by extension with iveight and 'pulley. Strips of strong adhesive plaster are applied

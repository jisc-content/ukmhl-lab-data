NEUROMATA. 325 high amputation is the only treatment to be nerves, so that recommended. Metastasis to internal organs is exceptional There are certain special types of neuro-fibromatosis which require brief mention. The plexiform neuroma is a fibromatosis confined to the distribution of one or more contiguous nerves or of a plexus of nerves, and it may occur either by itself or along with a generalised neuro-fibromatosis. The clinical features are those of an ill-defined swelling com- posed of a number of tortuous, convoluted cords, lying in a loose areolar tissue and freely movable on one another. It is rarely the seat of pain or tenderness. It most often appears in the early years of life, sometimes in relation to a pigmented or hairy mole. It is usually subcutaneous, and is frequently situated on the head or neck in the dis- tribution of the trigeminal or superficial cervical nerves. The results of excision are satisfactory, even if the re- moval be not quite complete. The cutaneous neuro-fi- broma or molluscum fibrosum has been shown by Von Recklinghausen to be a soft fibroma related to the ter- minal filaments of the cuta- neous nerves (Fig. 59). The disease appears in the form of multiple, soft, projecting tumours of the skin which are scattered over the body,—except on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet,—and are frequently associated with pigmentation of the skin and with multiple tumours of the nerve trunks. In exceptional cases one of the skin tumours may attain an enormous size and cause a hideous deformity, hanging down by its own weight in lobulated or folded masses (pachydermatocele). They are very closely related to the plexiform neuroma, and the skin over them may be pigmented and hairy. The treatment consists in the removal of the larger swellings, but the small multiple tumours rarely call for interference. Fig. 58.—Plexiform Neuroma of small Sciatic Nerve, from a girl aged 16.

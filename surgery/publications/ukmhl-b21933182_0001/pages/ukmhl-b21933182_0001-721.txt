697 COXA VARA. skeleton. It is most often associated with pronounced eversion of both lower extremities (Fig. 239), without the capacity for ab- duction being necessarily restricted, and with but little interference with function. The deformity is usually recovered from if the child receives the appropriate treatment for rickets, and is put up in a double long splint with the limbs inverted and abducted. In arthritis deformans of the hip-joint it is not uncommon to have considerable depression of the head of the bone and diminution in the angle of its neck, with consequent re- striction of abduction. Some- times the upper end of the shaft is curved as shown in Fig. 228. Injuries of the upper end of the femur may result in coxa vara—traumatic coxa vara (Royal Whitman). Greenstick fracture of the neck of the femur and separa- tion of the epiphysis of the head, when sustained in early childhood, may result in softening of the bone, so that it bends under the weight of the body. The deformity, which is the same as that described under adolescent coxa vara, may, however, not show itself until puberty. The treatment is carried out on the lines already indicated. Deformities in the Region of the Knee. Congenital Dislocation at the knee-joint is extremely rare. The displacement may be permanent, or may occur occasionally from accidental movements of the limb. In some cases it can be produced at will by the patient or the surgeon. The dislocation is usually incomplete, and its direction varies. Congenital Dislocation of the Patella outwards.—This may be persistent or intermittent. In the persistent form the patella lies on the external condyle. It may move into its normal place Fig. 239.—Eversion of Lower Limbs in Rickety Child, the subject of Coxa Vara.

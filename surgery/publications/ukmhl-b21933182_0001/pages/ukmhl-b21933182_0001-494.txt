An external rectang- ular splint is then applied, and the limb supported by a sling, so adjusted that it supports equally the hand and elbow, in order to avoid angular deformity. Tight bandaging and the use of special interosseous pads are to be 1 Fig. 120.—Gooch Splints for Frac ture of both Bones of Forearm.

When the fracture of the radius is above the in- sertion of the pronator radii teres, the forearm should be fixed in the position of complete supination, with the elbow flexed to an acute angle, and retained in this position by moulded anterior and posterior splints. This position is very irksome to the patient, and great care is necessary in the adjustment of the apparatus to prevent pronation. Massage and movement should be carried out early. It is usually necessary to continue wearing the splints for about four weeks. In cases of mal-union, especially when the bones are ankylosed to one another across the interosseous space, an operation may be neces- Fig. 122.—Badly united Fracture sary, but it is neither easy in its of both Bones of Forearm.

DISEASES OF LYMPHATIC VESSELS. 301 removed, on the other it may result in the formation of lymphatic sinuses and only afford temporary relief. Where operation is contra-indicated, relief may be afforded by the use of a pad and elastic bandage. Lymphangioma bears the same relation to lymph-vessels as angioma bears to blood-vessels. It consists of cavities and channels filled with lymph, which freely communicate with one another. Their walls are composed of fibro-areolar tissue, lined by endothelium, and sometimes strengthened by non-striped muscle. The cavities result either from the new formation of lymphatic spaces and vessels, or from the dilatation of those which already exist. When the tuniour is made up of a! mesh- work of cavities and channels, it is called a cavernous lymph- angioma ; when it is composed of one or more separate cysts, it is called a cystic lymph- angioma or lymph- atic cyst. It is prob- able that the cysts are derived from the caverns by the break- ing down and absorp- tion of the intervening- septa, and transition forms between the cavernous and cystic Fig. 53.â€”Congenital Cystic Tumour or varieties are frequently Hygroma, met with. They are probably all of congenital origin, and they usually appear at or shortly after birth. They are rarely provided with a definite capsule, and they frequently send prolongations of their sub- stance between and into muscles and other structures in their vicinity. The cavernous lymphangioma appears as an ill-defined soft swelling presenting many of the characters of the subcutaneous angioma, but it is not capable of being emptied by pressure, the skin over it is normal, and when the tumour is punctured

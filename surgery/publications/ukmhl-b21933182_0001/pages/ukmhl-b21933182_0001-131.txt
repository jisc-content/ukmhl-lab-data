BED-SORES. 107 of time at a stretch. Ring-pads of wool, air-cushions, or water- beds are necessary to remove pressure from prominent parts. Absolute dryness of the skin is all-important. At least once a day the sacrum, buttocks, shoulder-blades, heels, elbows, malleoli, or any other parts exposed to pressure must be sponged with soap and water, thoroughly dried, and then rubbed with methy- lated spirit, which is allowed to dry on the skin. Dusting the part with boracic acid powder not only keeps it dry, but prevents the development of bacteria in the skin secretions. Treatment.â€”Once a bed-sore has formed, every effort must be made to prevent its spread. Mild antiseptic lotions are used to cleanse the broken surface, and dry absorbent dressings are applied and frequently changed. It is sometimes found necessary to employ moist or oily substances, such as boracic poultices, eucalyptus ointment, or balsam of Peru, to facilitate the separation of sloughs, or to promote the growth of granulations. In patients who are not extremely debilitated the slough may be excised, the raw surface scraped and then painted with undiluted carbolic acid. Skin-grafting is sometimes useful in covering in the large raw surface left after separation or removal of sloughs.

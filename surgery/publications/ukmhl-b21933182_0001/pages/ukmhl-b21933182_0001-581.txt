The separation of sequestra is more rapid through the spongy bone at the end of the shaft than through the compact bone towards its centre, where the line of separation is often oblique. Where the foci of suppuration have been scat- tered up and down the medullary cavity, and the bone has died in patches, several sequestra may be included by the new case. Each portion of dead bone is slowly separated, and comes to lie in a cavity lined by granulations. As a result of formation of new bone by the marrow, the medullary canal may be obliterated, and the bone becomes heavier and denser—sclerosis. Wherever the periosteum has not been detached, the new bone which it forms is de- posited on the original shaft, and results in increase in the girth of the bone —hyperostosis. Pathological fracture of the shaft may occur before repair is complete. It oc- curs at the site of necrosis, where the new case is incapable of resist- ing the strain put upon it, and is most frequently met with in the shaft of the femur. Short of fracture, there may be bending or curving of the shaft from want of rigidity; this especially affects the new case, and results in great deformity and shortening of the limb. The spontaneous extrusion of a sequestrum may occur from the pressure Fio. 182. - Sequestrum of ?f gelations upon it, provided there Femur in process of Natural ^ cloaca large enough and so situated Extrusion. as to favour its escape (Fig. 182), (Mr. c. w. Macgiiiivray's case.) but the surgeon has usually to inter- fere by performing the operation of sequestrectomy. Displacement or partial extrusion of the dead bone may cause serious complications, as when a sequestrum Fig. 181.—Large Sequestrum of Lower Part of Shaft of Femur partly surrounded by New Bone ; the latter is bent as a result of fracture which took place years before amputation.

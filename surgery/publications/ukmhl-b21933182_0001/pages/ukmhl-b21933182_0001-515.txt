FRACTURES OF SACRUM AND COCCYX. 491 lies in the fact that crepitus may be present in addition to the symptoms of dislocation, and that the displacement is easily reproduced after reduction. This injury is liable to be mistaken for a fracture of the neck of the femur, but the flexion and internal rotation of the hip should prevent error. The treatment is the same as for fracture of the neck of the femur. A longitudinal fracture of the sacrum may occur and im- plicate the posterior part of the pelvic ring, as has already been mentioned. In rare cases the lower half of the bone is broken transversely from a fall or blow, and the lower part is bent forward so that it projects into the pelvis and may press upon or tear the rectum. The sacral nerves also may be damaged causing partial paralysis of the lower limbs, bladder, or rectum. These fractures are frequently comminuted and compound, and the soft parts may be so severely bruised and lacerated that sloughing follows. On rectal examination the lower segment of the bone may be felt, and on manipulating it pain and crepitus may be elicited. Fracture of the coccyx is due to a direct blow, or it may occur during parturi- tion. As a result of this injury the patient may have severe pain on sitting or walking— coccygodynia. The loose fragment can usually be recognised by rectal examination. An attempt should be made to replace the lower fragment. The patient is kept in bed with a firm binder applied. If the lower fragment is united at an angle so as to cause pressure on the rectum, it may be necessary to excise it. Injuries in the Region of the Hip. We have here to consider the various fractures of the upper end of the femur ; dislocations and sprains of the hip-joint; and contusions of the hip. Surgical Anatomy.—The strength of the hip-joint depends primarily on its osseous elements—the rounded head of the femur tilling the deep Pin. 138.—Longitudinal Fracture of Sacrum from same Patient as Fig. 136.

POTT’S FRACTURE. 537 usually resists, and an oblique fracture of the fibula three or four inches from its lower end results. Clinical Features.—In a considerable proportion of cases—in our experience in the majority—this fracture is not accompanied by any marked deformity of the foot, and the patient is often able to walk after the injury with only a slight limp. In others, however, the deformity is marked and characteristic (Fig. 170). The foot is everted, its inner side resting on the ground. The internal malleolus is unduly prominent, stretching the skin, which may give way if the patient attempt to walk. The foot having lost the support of the malleoli, is often dis- placed backward, and the toes are pointed by the contraction of the calf muscles. There is abnormal mobility — both lateral and antero-posterior—and crepitus may be elic- ited. The points of tenderness are over the internal lateral ligament or internal malleolus, according to which is damaged ; the inferior tibio- fibular joint, and at Fig. 170.—Pott’s Fracture with marked the seat of fracture deformity, of the fibula. Distal pressure over the shaft of the fibula, or on the extreme tip of the malleolus, may also elicit pain and crepitus at the seat of fracture. There is usually considerable ecchymosis and swelling- in the hollows below the malleoli. In Dupuytren’s fracture, when the astragalus passes up between the tibia and fibula, there is great broadening of the ankle. There is often great difficulty in distinguishing a fracture without displacement in the region of the ankle-joint from a sprain. Both forms of injury result from the same kinds of violence, and are rapidly followed by marked swelling and discoloration of the overlying soft parts. When a sprain is accompanied by effusion into the ankle-joint there is a distinct tender swelling in front of the articulation, especially marked

In hinge joints, such as the knee or elbow, the eburnated articular surfaces may present a series of Fig. 211.—Arthritis Deformans of Knee, showing eburnation and grooving of articular surfaces.

Although the joint may become locked by the amount of new bone formed around the articular margins, fibrous or bony ankylosis scarcely ever occurs. The changes in the synovial membrane vary in different types of the disease. In some cases it merely undergoes a de- generative alteration into cicatricial tissue with a marked tendency to contraction —-arthritis sicca. In other cases it actively participates in the proliferative changes, becoming more vascular and thickened; and, as the result of hyper- trophy of its fringes and enlargement and subdivision of its villi, becomes thickly set with elongated or club-shaped processes which hang into the cavity of the joint (Fig. 212). The term arbor- escent lipoma is applied to the condition movement (Fig. is in inverse ratio to the Fig. 212. — Hypertrophied Fringes of Synovial Membrane in Arthritis Deformans of Knee. when fringes composed of fat are de- ^M^""0ns ^cjin\)?,<?ihS)e of veloped to an exaggerated degree. In- dividual fringes may undergo special enlargement, and form pendulous growths in the interior of which cartilage and bone may be formed; these may attain the size of a hazel-nut or even

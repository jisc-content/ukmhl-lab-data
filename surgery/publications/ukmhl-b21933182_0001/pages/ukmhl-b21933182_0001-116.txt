GANGRENE. 92 varied that it is difficult to devise a simple classification. For practical purposes, however, they may be divided into two great classes: I. Those in which the gangrene is essentially due to interference with the circulation; and II. Those in which it is essentially due to bacterial infection. Gangrene essentially due to Interference with the Circulation.—This group includes the various forms of local tissue necrosis in which micro-organisms do not play the most important part in producing death. Their sub- sequent introduction is an accident, albeit one of I'W'IWk such bnportance that it changes the whole aspect of affairs and converts a dry form of gangrene into one of the moist type. Moreover, the low state of vitality of the tissues, and the extreme difficulty of securing and maintaining asepsis make it a sequel of great frequency. Gangrene from Physico-chemical Causes.—When a localised portion of tissue—for example, a piece of skin— is so severely crushed or bruised that its blood-vessels are occluded and its structure destroyed, it immediately dies, and, if not infected with bacteria, dries up and forms a shrivelled brown slough, which is slowly separated by the growth of granulation tissue beneath and around it (Fig. 17). Fingers, toes, or even considerable portions of limbs may in the same way be suddenly destroyed by severe trauma and undergo mummification. If organisms gain access, typical moist gangrene may ensue, or changes similar to those of ordinary post-mortem decomposition may take place. Severe burns and scalds may be followed by the same results. So long as the parts are kept absolutely dry—as, for example, by the picric acid method of treatment—the grossly- damaged portions of tissue undergo dry gangrene; but when moist or oily dressings are applied and organisms gain access, moist gangrene follows. Frost-bite.—It is difficult to draw the line between the third degree of chilblain and the milder forms of true frost-bite.

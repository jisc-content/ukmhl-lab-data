500 INJURIES OF PELVIS, HIP-JOINT, AND THIGH. to each side of the limb, reaching well above the middle of the thigh. To the lower ends of these are attached broad tapes, to which a stirrup is buckled, and through it traction is made by means of a cord passing over a pulley, the weight varying with the requirements of the case. In a moderately muscular adult a weight of from six to eight pounds should be applied at first, and increased or diminished as required. The correct weight to employ is that which maintains the length of the 'limb at its normal. In some cases it may be necessary to use as much as fifteen or twenty pounds. The joints above and below the fracture are controlled by means of Liston’s long splint, which extends from the axilla to two or three inches beyond the foot. The part of the splint which lies in contact with the lower extremity is enclosed in a sheet which envelops the limb, while the upper part is fixed to the thorax by means of a broad roller bandage. Rotation of the limb is prevented by fixing the lower end of the splint in a foot rest. It is often an Fig. 146.—Long Splint with Extension Plasters advantage to apply a applied for Fracture of Neck of Femur. long splint to the sound leg in addition, and to connect the two splints by a cross-bar below. Hodgen’s splint (Fig. 150) may also be employed in the treat- ment of these fractures. When these methods are not available, or when the patient has to be transported, extension may be obtained by means of a perineal band attached to Liston’s long splint (Fig. 147). The patient’s foot, carefully padded, is fixed to the lower end of the splint by means of a bandage or triangular handkerchief. By pushing the splint down traction is made upon the limb, and

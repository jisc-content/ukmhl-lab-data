Congenital dislocation of hip—Paralytic deformities—Contractures and ankyloses of hip—Coxa vara—Congenital dislocations of knee and patella—Genu recurvatum—Paralytic deformities—Contractures and ankyloses of knee—Genu valgum and genu varum—Congenital deformities of leg—Bow-leg—Club-foot: Talipes equino varus—Pes equinus—Pes calcaneus—Pes calcaneo-valcjus and varus—Pes cavus —Flat-foot and pes valgus — Metatarsalgia—Hallux valgus and bunion—Hallux varus—Hallux rigidus and flexus—Hammer-toe— Hypertrophy of toes—Supernumerary toes—Webbed toes — Con- genital absence of clavicle—Winged scapula—Congenital paralytic deformities of shoulder — Deformities of elbow—Club-hand—De- formities of wrist—Deformities of fingers—Dupuytren’s contraction —Polydactylism. In this chapter we shall study those abnormalities in the attitude and form of the limbs—whether congenital or acquired—which are capable of being benefited by mechanical or operative treatment. This subject constitutes an important branch of what is known as orthopaedic surgery. DEFORMITIES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Congenital Dislocation of the Hip. This is the commonest of all congenital dislocations. Its frequency varies in different countries, being much greater on the continent of Europe than in Britain. It is sometimes hereditary, and it may be associated with other congenital deformities, such as club-foot. It is seven times more common in the female than in the male. It may occur on one or on both sides, but unilateral dislocation is decidedly the more frequent.

518 INJURIES IN REGION OF KNEE AND LEG. siderable proportion of all vai’ieties are compound, and the damage to the contents of the popliteal space is often so great as to necessitate primary amputation. The varieties are named in terms of the direction in which the tibia passes. Dislocation forward is the most common variety (Fig. 159), Fig. 159.—Forward Dislocation of Knee. (Specimen in Professor Annandale’s collection.) and results from sudden hyper-extension of the knee. It is often compound through a wound in the popliteal space. The leg remains fully extended, and lies on a plane anterior to that of the thigh. The condyles are distinctly palpable posteriorly, and the skin is tightly stretched over them, or may even be torn. The Fig. 160.—Backward Dislocation of Knee. (Ur. Mills-Roberts' Case.) patella is projected forward, and the skin above it is thrown into transverse folds. Dislocation backward is usually due to a direct blow driving one of the bones past the other. The leg remains hyper- extended, the head of the tibia occupies the popliteal space, while the lower end of the femur projects forward with the patella either in front or to one side of it. The lateral dislocations are generally incomplete. In the

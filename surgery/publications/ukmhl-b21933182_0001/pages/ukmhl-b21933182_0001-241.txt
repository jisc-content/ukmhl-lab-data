217 BURNS AND SCALDS. the patient usually having fallen asleep before the fire while intoxicated (Fig. 39). The damage done to the tissues by strong caustics, such as fuming nitric acid, sulphuric acid, caustic potash, nitrate of silver, or arsenical paste, presents pathological and clinical features almost identical with those resulting from heat. Pathology of Burns. — Much discussion has taken place regarding the explanation of the rapidly-fatal issue in extensive superficial burns. On post-mortem examination the lesions found in these cases are: (1) general hypersemia of all the organs of the abdominal, thoracic, and cerebro-spinal cavities; (2) marked leucocytosis, with destruction of red corpuscles, setting free hsemoglobin which lodges in the epithelial cells of the tubules of the kidneys ; (3) minute thrombi and extravasa- Fiu. 39.—Burn of Fifth Degree, exposing the Patella.

Cotterill's Case.) tions throughout the tissues of the body; (4) degeneration of the ganglion cells of the solar plexus ; (5) general oedema and degeneration of all the lymphoid tissue throughout the body; (6) cloudy swelling of the liver and kidneys, and softening and enlargement of the spleen. Bardeen suggests that these morbid phenomena correspond so closely to those met with where the presence of a toxin is known to produce them, that in all probability death is similarly due to the action of some poison, the source and nature of which are as yet unknown. Clinical Features.—Local Phenomena.—The most generally- accepted classification of burns is that of Dupuytren, which is based upon the depth of the lesion. Six degrees are thus recognised: (1) hyperamiia or erythema; (2) vesication; (3) partial destruction of the thickness of the time skin; (4) total destruction of the thickness of the true skin ; (5) charring of muscles ; (6) charring of bones.

THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 274 only element in the sac. To withstand the pressure the outer coat becomes thickened, and as the aneurysm increases in size it forms adhesions to surrounding tissues, so that fasciae, tendons, nerves, and other structures may be found matted together in the wall of the aneurysm. The wall is further strengthened by the deposit on its inner aspect of blood-clot, which may eventually become organised. The contents of the aneurysmal sac consist of fluid blood, and a varying amount of blood-clot which is deposited in con- centric layers on the inner aspect of the sac, constituting a laminated clot. Towards the centre of the sac the clot is soft, red, and granular; while near the wall it is firm, and pale in colour, being more or less completely organised (Fig. 51). Fig. 51.—Sacculated Aneurysm of Abdominal Aorta nearly filled with laminated clot. Note greater density of clot towards periphery. The laminated clot not only strengthens the sac, enabling it to resist the blood pressure, and so preventing rupture, but, if it increases sufficiently to fill the cavity, may bring about spontaneous cure. The principle upon which all methods of treatment are based is to imitate nature in producing such a clot. So long as the sac remains intact the aneurysm is spoken of as circumscribed ; when it gives way, and the blood escapes into the surrounding tissues, the aneurysm is said to be diffused. When one or more of the coats of the artery enter into the formation of the sac, the aneurysm is sometimes called a “ true aneurysm ” : while the term “ false ” is applied when all the coats have given way and the sac is formed entirely by con- densation of the surrounding structures. These terms, however, have been used in so many different senses, and are in them- selves so misleading, that we do not employ them. Dissecting Aneurysm.—The blood may force its way

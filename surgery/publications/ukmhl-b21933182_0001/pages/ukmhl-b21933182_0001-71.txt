CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. 47 consists of compound mercury ointment spread on lint, which is placed on the part and hxed in position by imbricated strips of plaster firmly applied from below upward, A suitable splint to ensure immobility of the joint is useful. Massage.—In employing massage to promote absorption of inflammatory products, the healthy part on the proximal side of the affected area should first be firmly stroked in the direction of the venous and lymphatic flow, so as to empty the vessels. The indurated area is next rubbed, squeezed, kneaded, or tapped, to break up the inflammatory products, and then stroked—again centripetally—to effect their removal. The part of the swelling nearest the trunk is first attacked, and the process extended in a distal direction. The frequency and duration of the sittings will depend on the site, extent, and general nature of the inflammatory condition, fifteen to twenty minutes once or twice daily being found sufficient in most cases.

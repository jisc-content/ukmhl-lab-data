452 INJURIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. controlled by a shoulder-cap, or by binding the limb to the chest by a wide roller bandage. Massage and movement are carried out from the second week onward. The patient should be allowed to use the fingers, wrist and forearm to some extent. In oblique fractures, when there is difficulty in preventing overriding and redisplacement, the fragments may be exposed by incision, and fixed to each other by mechanical means. When there is evidence that the musculo-spiral nerve has been injured, and no sign of improvement appears within three or four days, operative interference is indicated. An incision is made on the outer side of the arm, exposing the nerve, which is then freed from pressure by fragments or callus; or if torn across, the nerve should be stitched. In cases of old standing it has been found necessary to resect a portion of the shaft of the humerus to enable the ends of the nerve to be approximated. The opportunity should also be taken of dealing with the frac- ture as may be necessary. In cases of ununited fracture a vertical or semilunar incision is made over the outer aspect of the bone, and the muscles separated from one another till the fracture is exposed, care being taken to avoid injuring the musculo-spiral nerve. The ends of the bone are refreshed by removing the fibrous tissue which covers them, and the rawed surfaces fixed in apposition by pegs, screws, or wires. The wound is then closed, and appropriate splints and other retentive apparatus applied. As soon as the wound has healed massage is commenced.

FRACTURES IN THE REGION OF THE ANKLE. 541 along the epiphysial line. The internal malleolus alone may be carried away, or a portion of the broad part of the tibia may accompany it. The foot is inverted, the heel falls back, and the toes are pointed (Fig. 174). In other respects it corresponds to the typical Pott’s fracture, and is treated on the same principles. When Dupuytren’s splint is required it is, of course, applied to the outer side of the leg. Separation of the lower epiphysis of the tibia is not very com- mon. It occurs most frequently between the age of eleven and eighteen as a result of forcible eversion or inversion of the foot. It is usually accom- panied by fracture of the diaphysis of the fibula, and is not in- frequently compound. Fro. 1/4. —Con- , h , verse of Pott’s Whe,u dlSPlaced OUt- Fracture.

Fracture of the astragalus may occur as a result of a fall from a height, the bone being crushed between the tibia and the os calcis. It is usually associated with other fractures, and its diagnosis is only to be made by exclusion, or by the use of the Rbntgen rays. In interpreting radiograms of injuries in this region, care must be taken not to mistake the os trigonum tarsi for a fracture. The only satisfactory treatment is complete excision of the bone—an operation which usually yields very good results. Fig. 175.—Partial Separation of Lower Epiphysis of Tibia, in a boy aet. 16.

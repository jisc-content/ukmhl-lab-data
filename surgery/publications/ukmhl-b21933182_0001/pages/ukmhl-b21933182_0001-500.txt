476 INJURIES OF WRIST AND HAND. of the hand. Like Colies’ fracture, it may be transverse or slightly oblique, impacted, or comminuted. The deformity is characterised by an elevation on the dorsum running obliquely upwards from the ulnar to the radial side of the wrist, and caused by the head of the ulna, which remains in position, and the lower end of the upper fragment. Below this, over the position of the lower radial fragment, is a gradual slope onto the dorsum of the hand. Anteriorly there is a prominence in the flexure of the wrist, and the lower fragment may be felt under the flexor tendons. The hand deviates to the radial side, and thereby still further increases the prominence caused by the lower end of the ulna. The radial styloid is displaced forward, upward, and to the radial side, and the ulnar styloid may be torn off. Crepitus can seldom be elicited. When the deformity is not well marked, this injury may be mistaken for forward dislocation of the wrist, fracture of both bones low down, or for sprain of the joint. The treatment is carried out on the same lines as in Colles’ fracture. Longitudinal fractures of the lower end of the radius opening into the joint usually result from the hand being crushed by a heavy weight or in machinery. They are often compound and comminuted. Separation of the lower epiphysis of the radius is com- paratively common between the ages of twelve and eighteen, and is caused by the same forms of violence as produce Colles’ fracture. Although the clinical appearances in these two injuries bear a general resemblance to one another, separation of the epiphysis may usually be identified by the directly trans- verse line of the dorsal and palmar projections, the folding of the skin observed in the palmar depression, the absence of abduction of the hand, and the ease with which muffled crepitus can be elicited (E. H. Bennett). The deformity is readily reduced, and the fragments are easily retained in position.

CHAPTER XX. 383 INJURIES OF BONES. Contusions—Wounds—Fractures : Pathological; Traumatic; Varieties —Simple fractures — Compound fractures—Separation of Epi- physes—Repair of fractures—Interference with repair. The injuries to which a bone is liable are Contusions, Open Wounds, and Fractures. Contusions of Bone are almost of necessity associated clinically with similar injuries of the overlying soft parts. The mildest degree consists in a bruising of the periosteum, which is raised from the bone by an effusion of blood, constituting a hcematoma of the 'periosteum. This may be rapidly and completely absorbed, or it may give place to a thickening of the bone (traumatic node), which may persist for a long time and be attended with deep-seated pain. In more severe cases the osseous tissue is compressed or even splintered, and blood is effused into the cancellated tissue or medullary cavity. Tendons or ligaments may be stretched or partially torn from their attachments to bone, leading to an effusion of Hood, which may ultimately be replaced by newly formed osseous tissue. Contusions of bone may play a part in the etiology of acute osteo-myelitis and of tuberculosis, by furnishing an area of depressed tissue for the lodgment'of bacteria circulating in the blood. It has been sometimes alleged that atrophy with shortening may follow contusions of bone in old people—as, for example, in the neck of the femur, but there is reason to doubt this. Treatment.—Rest, elevation, the application of lead and opium or carbolic fomentations, or of an ice-bag, constitute the best methods of treatment. Massage and the internal ad- ministration of potassium iodide favour the absorption of effusions and nodes.

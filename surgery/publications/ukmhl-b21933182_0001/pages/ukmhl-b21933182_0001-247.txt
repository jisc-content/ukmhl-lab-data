INJURIES PRODUCED BY ELECTRICITY. 223 An alternative method of treating extensive burns is by- immersing the part, or even the whole body when the trunk is affected, in a bath of boracic lotion kept at the body tempera- ture, the lotion being frequently renewed. When a burn is already septic when first seen by the surgeon it is to be treated on the same principles as govern the treatment of other infected wounds. All moist or greasy applications, such as Carron oil, carbolic oil and ointments, and all substances like collodion and dry powders, which retain discharges, entirely fail to meet the indications for the rational treat- ment of burns, and should be abandoned. Thiersch grafting is of great value in hastening the healing after extensive burns, and in preventing cicatricial contrac- tion. The deformities which are so liable to develop from con- traction of the cicatrices result- ing from burns are treated on the general principles governing plastic operations. In the region of the face (Fig. 43), neck, and flexures of joints (Fig. 42), where they are most marked, the contracted bands may be divided and the parts stretched, the raw surface left being covered by Thiersch grafts or by flaps of skin raised from adjacent surfaces and glided or twisted into position.

Lesions of the nature of burns frequently result from the action of electricity on the tissues of the body. They differ i: sufficiently from ordinary burns to merit separate description, and may be considered under the headings of (1) injuries 1 produced by exposure to the Rdntgen rays, (2) electrical burns, and (3) lightning-stroke. Injuries produced by Exposure to the Rdntgen Rays.— There is still some difference of opinion amongst authorities as to whether these lesions are due to the influence of electricity

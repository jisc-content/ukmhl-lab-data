652 DISEASES OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. outside the coracoid, or just below the junction of the acromion and spine of the scapula. Cold abscess is treated on the usual lines. Operation should not be delayed in cases which do not yield to conservative measures. Excision of the joint is a very satisfactory operation, and although ankylosis usually occurs, the arm is a useful one. Pyogenic Diseases.—The shoulder-joint may be infected by extension of suppurative periostitis and osteomyelitis from the upper end of the humerus, or from suppura- tion in the axilla, or through the blood-stream in pyaemia, typhoid, or gonorrhoea, When it is necessary to drain the joint the incision should be placed anteriorly in the line of the bicipital groove, and a counter-opening made on the posterior aspect by cutting on the point of a dressing forceps introduced through the anterior in- cision. Arthritis Deformans.— The shoulder is seldom the only joint affected, except when the arthritis is a sequel to injury. The com- mon type of lesion is a dry arthritis with fibrillation and subsequent eburnation of the articular surfaces. The long tendon of the biceps is usually destroyed, and the head of the bone may be drawn upwards, and, after wearing through the capsule, rubs on the under surface of the acromion. The prominent clinical features are pain, stiff- ness, and crackling on movement. Neuro-arthropathies of the shoulder are chiefly met with in cases of syringomyelia. The clinical features may be a large and painless swelling with fluctuation in the region of the shoulder, or marked and rapid wasting of the deltoid and scapular muscles with flail-like movements of the joint, associ- Fiu. 219.—Arthropathy of Shoulder in Syringomyelia. The upper end of the liuinerus had disappeared and the move- ments were flail-like.

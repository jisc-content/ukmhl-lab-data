THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 252 There is evidence that the tendency to bleed is greater at some times than at others—in certain cases showing almost a cyclical character—although nothing is known as to the cause of the variation. After a severe haemorrhage into the cellular tissue or into a joint, the patient becomes pale and anaemic, the temperature may rise to 102° or 103° F., the pulse become small and rapid, and hsemic murmurs are sometimes developed over the heart and large arteries. The swelling is tense, fluctuating, and hot, and there is considerable pain and tenderness. In exceptional cases blisters form over the seat of the effusion, or the skin may even slough, and the clinical features may therefore come to simulate closely those of an acute suppurative condition. The acute symptoms gradually subside, and the effused blood Fio. 44.—Extensive Subcutaneous Effusion in case of Haemophilia.

Prolonged external hiemorrhage is usually associated with a subnormal temperature. The patients bear the loss of blood remarkably well, and the blood is rapidly regenerated. The diagnosis is usually easy if the patient or his friends are aware of the family tendency to haemorrhage and inform the surgeon of it, but they are often very sensitive and reticent regarding the fact, and it may only be elicited after close in- vestigation. Scurvy and purpura are usually excluded with ease. Repeated hemorrhages into a joint may result in appearances which closely simulate those of tuberculous disease. Recent hemorrhages into the cellular tissue often present clinical features closely resembling those of acute cellulitis or osteo-inyelitis (Fig. 44). A careful examination, however, may reveal superficial bruises on other parts of the body which give a clue to the nature of the condition, and may prevent the disastrous con- sequences which would follow incision of the swelling.

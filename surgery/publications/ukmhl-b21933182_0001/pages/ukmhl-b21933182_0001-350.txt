326 THE NERVES. Elephantiasis neuromatosa is the name applied by Virchow to a condition in which a limb is swollen and misshapen as a result of the extension of a neuro-fibromatosis to the skin and cellular tissue of the extremity as a whole. While it resembles other forms of elephantiasis, it usually begins in early life without apparent'cause, and it may be associated with multiple tumours of the nerve trunks. The incon- venience caused by the bulk and weight of the limb may justify its removal by amputation. SURGERY OF THE INDIVIDUAL NERVES. The brachial plexus may be con- tused by the wheel of a cart striking the root of the neck, by displacement of the fragments in a fracture of the clavicle, or by forcible abduction of the arm during anaesthesia, the cords being compressed between the clavicle and first rib. The cords may be torn from their origin by violent traction of the arm upwards and backwards —as by clutching an object when falling from a height. The symptoms vary with the nature and extent of the lesion. When all the cords are ruptured, ~ "mata of “Skin *'(Molluscum the arm hangs powerless by the side, fibrosum). and is anaesthetic save over the upper (After Von Recklinghausen.) deltoid region. If the first dorsal root is torn close to its point of emergence from the intervertebral foramen, there is paralysis of the sympathetic fibres to the eye and orbit, with narrowing of the palpebral fissure and recession of the globe, and the pupil is slow to dilate when shaded from the light. The usual trophic changes supervene in the arm, and the humerus is displaced downwards by the weight of the limb. In partial lesions the fifth and sixth cervical roots most often suffer. They are liable to be stretched as a result of the indi- vidual landing on the shoulder, while the head on touching

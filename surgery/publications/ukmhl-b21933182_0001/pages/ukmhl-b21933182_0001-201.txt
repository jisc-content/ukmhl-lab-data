INHERITED SYPHILIS. 177 found to be less amenable to the influence of iodides, and that we must depend very largely on measures calculated to improve the general health. Surgical interference may be required in the destructive gummatous lesions of the nose, throat, larynx and bones, either with the object of arresting the spread of the disease, or of removing or alleviating the resulting deformities. In children suffering from keratitis, the eyes should be protected from the light by wearing smoked or coloured glasses, and the pupils should be dilated with atropin from time to time, especially in cases complicated with iritis. Acquired Syphilis in Infants and Younc/ Children.—When syphilis is met with in infants and young children, it is apt to be taken for granted that the disease has been inherited. It is possible, however, for them to acquire the disease—as, for example, while passing through the maternal passages during birth, through being nursed or kissed by infected women, or through the rite of circumcision. The risk of infection which formerly existed by the arm to arm method of vaccination has been abolished by the general adoption of calf lymph. The clinical features of the acquired disease in infants and young children are very similar to those observed in the adult, with a tendency, however, to be more severe, partly because the disease is often late in being recognised and treated.

FRACTURES OF THE NECK OF THE FEMUR, 497 especially when the periosteum and cervical ligaments have been completely torn. In sub-periosteal and in impacted fractures it sometimes occurs. As a rule, however, the neck of the femur becomes absorbed and disappears, the head of the bone comes to lie in contact with the base of the trochanter, and a false joint forms. In a few cases chronic changes of the nature of arthritis deformans occur in and around such false joints. There is reason to doubt the statement that absorption of the neck follows a simple contusion of the bone without fracture. Fracture through the Base of the Neck.—This fracture is usually produced by severe violence inflicted directly over the great trochanter, although it is occasionally due to falls on the feet or knees. It has been attributed to muscular action alone. In these latter cases traction on the ligaments is probably an important factor. Although often spoken of as “ extra-capsular,” the line of fracture is generally partly within and partly without the capsule, on account of the disposition of the capsular ligament already described. It usually lies close to the junction of the neck with the shaft. In the great majority of cases this fracture of the neck is accompanied by breaking of one or both trochanters. This is due to the inner fragment being driven as a wedge into the outer, splitting up the trochanters. When the VOL.

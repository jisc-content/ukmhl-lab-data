661 THE HIP-JOINT. tion, it may sometimes be possible witli care and gentleness to obtain a little increase of flexion. For diagnostic purposes most stress should therefore be laid on the presence or absence of rotation — for example, if a patient exhibits abduction and flexion, while it is possible to elicit rotation movements, the probability is that he is not suffering from disease in the joint, but from some affection in its neighbourhood. Swelling should be looked for on the anterior aspect of the joint. When present it may fill up the fold of the groin, and project forward the femoral vessels. It is doughy and elastic like the white swelling of other joints, but may at any time liquefy and form a cold abscess. Swelling about the trochanter and neck of the bone may be estimated by measuring with calipers and comparing with the sound side. The absence of Fig. 224.—Disease of Left Hip—lordosis of spine on extension of the joint. swelling does not. preclude the existence of grave lesions in the interior of the bone. Swelling on the pelvic aspect of the acetabulum may be discovered on rectal examination. Third Stage. — The patient now presents unmistakable symptoms of hip disease in the form of adduction, inversion, increase of flexion, and apparent or real shortening of the limb (Fig. 225). This probably corresponds with advanced caries of the articular surfaces, since pain is now a more prominent feature, and there are usually startings at night. This stage is not often met with nowadays, because the disease is diagnosed in its earlier stages and appropriate treatment adopted. The flexion is usually so pronounced that it can no longer be concealed by lordosis, so that when the patient is recumbent, although the spine is arched forwards, the limb is still flexed both at the hip and at the knee. When the spine is flat on the table the flexion of the thigh may amount to as much as a right angle. The adduction varies very

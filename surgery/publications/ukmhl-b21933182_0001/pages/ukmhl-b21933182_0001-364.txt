340 THE SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE. from syphilitic lesions of the skin by their acute onset anti progress, and by the absence of other evidence of syphilis ; and from the malignant or anthrax pustule by the absence of the central black slough and of the circumstances which usually favour anthrax infection. Treatment.—The local treatment consists in relieving the pain of the boil and in preventing the occurrence of others. The skin of the affected area should be sterilised as if for an operation. ’ A blind boil should be covered with Unna’s mercury and carbolic plaster, or an ointment containing 20 per cent, oleate of mercury and 5 per cent, carbolic acid should be rubbed into the skin over it. Where boils tend to recur on the back of the neck this ointment should be rubbed into the skin every second night. In boils on the trunk and limbs, lysol or boracic baths are of great service ; the underclothing should be frequently changed, and that which is discarded should be disinfected. In a boil which is going on to suppuration the question of incision arises. As in other suppurative lesions, suffering is relieved and repair is hastened by a timely incision and evacua- tion of the pus. The core is then removed with the sharp spoon, and the wound swabbed On the other hand, warm carbolic fomentations may be applied until the boil bursts and the core separates. The further treatment consists in the use of diluted boracic or resin ointment. Although constitutional treatment has no direct curative influence on boils, any impaired condition of health should be corrected. When there is sugar or albumin in the urine the conditions on which these depend must receive appropriate treatment. Carbuncle is a spreading inflammation of the deeper layers of the skin attended with suppuration and sloughing (Fig. 62). Fro. 62.—Large Carbuncle of Back, out with pure carbolic acid.

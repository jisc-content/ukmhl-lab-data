502 INJURIES OF PELVIS, HIP-JOINT, AND THIGH. fracture is treated on the same lines as fractures of the shaft of the bone. In cases in which the upper fragment cannot be brought into line with the lower one, however, it is necessary to flex and slightly rotate outward and abduct the thigh in order to get the fragments into apposition. This is most simply done by means of a double - inclined plane, while at the same time extension may be applied in the axis of the thigh. Hodgen’s splint fulfils these indications. It has the ad- vantage of permitting of the patient being moved or even propped up in bed without fear of disturbing the fracture. The apparatus consists of a wire frame to one side of which a series of strips of flannel about four inches wide are attached. The frame, which extends from the level of l’oupart’s ligament to well beyond the sole, is placed over the front of the limb, and the loose ends of the flannel strips, brought round behind the limb, and fixed to the other side of the frame, convert it into a sling. The strips of flannel may be replaced with advantage by a strong, wide-meshed net. Extension strapping is applied to the limb in the usual way, and is attached to the lower end of the frame. By suspending the limb in this splint by means of cords passing obliquely over a pulley attached to an upright at the Fig. 148.—Fracture of Femur just below tlie Small Trochanter showing flexion and external rotation of upper fragment.

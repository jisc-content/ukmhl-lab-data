456 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. epiphysis there is a peculiar deformity of the posterior aspect of the joint, consisting of two projections — one the olecranon process, and the other the prominent capitellum with a scale of cartilage which it carries with it from the external condyle (R. W. Smith and E. H. Bennett). The smooth rounded end of the diaphysis may sometimes be palpated through the skin in front. Muffled crepitus can usually be elicited, and there is pain on pressing the segments against one another.

Union takes place more rapidly than in true fracture, but owing to the excessive formation of callus from the torn periosteum in front of the joint, full flexion is often interfered with. If the displaced epiphysis is imperfectly reduced, serious interference with the function of the elbow is liable to result, and may even call for operative interference. Fracture of either Condyle alone.—The internal condyle is more frequently separated from the rest of the bone than is the external. In either case the size of the fragment varies, but the line of fracture is always partly extra-capsular and partly

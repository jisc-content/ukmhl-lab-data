700 THE DEFORMITIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. In spastic paralysis the knee is affected along with the other joints of the limb, and usually presents a condition of contracture with flexion and genu valgum (Fig. 241). In ceitain cases an attempt may be made by arthrodesis to render the limb capable of giving support. . . Contracture and Ankylosis at the Knee. In addition to the different paralytic forms above described, contracture may result from hysteria, from ulceration and suppuration in the popliteal space, and from disease—osteomyelitis — in one of the adjacent bones. The greater number of contractures and anky- loses are the result of disease of the joint, and have been already described. Genu Valgum and Genu Varum.' In the normal limb, a line drawn from the centre of the head of the femur to a point midway between the malleoli passes through the centre of the knee-joint.

Genu Valgum—Knock-knee.—In this deformity the leg joins the thigh at an angle which is open outwards. When the affection is bilateral the projecting knees tend to knock against each other in walking, and the term X-legs may be applied to it. Our knowledge of knock-knee is largely due to the observations of Macewen and of Mikulicz, and to information afforded by the Rontgen rays. Etiology.—While attention was formerly directed to the soft parts as being concerned in the production of knock-knee, it is now known that the primary cause is in the bones, and that it consists in an inequality of growth at the ossifying junctions of the femur and tibia. In children the essential cause is the

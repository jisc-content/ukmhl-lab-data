THE HIP-JOINT. G75 the j normal The greatest difficulty is met with in cases where the disease occurs in early life as a monarticular affection, for the resem- blance to tuberculosis may be so close that the diagnosis is impossible until the joint is explored by operation. Skiagrams do not always aid in differentiating between them. The treatment consists in seeking to preserve movements of the joint, and in dim- inishing the pres- sure on the articu- lar surfaces by the use of sticks or crutches in walk- ing. Shortening of the limb may be compensated for by heightening the sole of the boot. Forcible movements of the joint under an anaesthetic do more harm than good. Excision of the joint has in some cases yielded satisfactory results; it is indicated in young patients who are otherwise healthy, and who are unable to walk on account of pain and deformity. The treatment of arthritis de- formans in general must also be carried out. Neuro - Arthropathies.— Char- cot's disease is usually met vTith in men over thirty suffering from tabes dorsalis. One or both liip- joints may be affected. Some- times the development of a fluctuat- ing swelling in the upper part of Scarpa’s triangle may indicate the presence of hydrops. In many of the recorded cases, however, attention has been first directed to the disease by the deformity and limp associated with disappearance of the head of the femur, or by the occurrence of pathological dis- location. The absence of pain and tenderness is characteristic. When dislocation has occurred, the limb is short, and the upper end of the femur is freely movable on the dorsum ilii. When both hips are dislocated (Fig. 229) the attitude and gait are similar to those observed in bilateral congenital dislocation. The rotation arc of the great trochanter may be much reduced Fig. 229. — Bilateral Charcot’s Disease of Hip, with dislocation of head of femur on to dorsum ilii. (Dr. H. G. Langwill’s ease.)

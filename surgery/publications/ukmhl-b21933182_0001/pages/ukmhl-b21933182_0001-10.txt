PREFACE. VI are from drawings or photographs in our own collections. We have not considered it necessary to introduce illustrations of surgical instruments. Our thanks are due to Dr. Logan Turner for his contributions on the affections of the Ear, Nose, and Larynx; and to Dr. Thomas D. Luke for the section on Anaesthetics. Edinburgh, January 1904.

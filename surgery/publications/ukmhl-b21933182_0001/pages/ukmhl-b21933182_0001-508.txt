484 INJURIES OF WRIST AND HAND. Treatment. — The contiguous fingers should be utilised as lateral splints, while a long palmar splint projecting beyond the fingers is employed to control the wrist-joint. Early movement and massage are necessary to prevent adhesions of tendons and consequent stiffness. In oblique and comminuted fractures it may be necessary to anaesthetise the patient to effect reduction; and in some cases extension applied in the same way as for fracture of a metacarpal is useful. When it is particularly desirable to avoid, deformity an open operation may be advisable. Fig. 133.—Tracing of Radiogram of Fracture of Phalanx united. Dislocations.—Dislocations of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb.—The commonest dislocation at this joint is a bach- ward displacement of the proximal phalanx, which may be complete or incomplete. Its special clinical importance lies in the fact that much difficulty is often experienced in effecting reduction. This dislocation is usually produced by extreme dorsi-flexion of the thumb, whereby the palmar or glenoid, and the lateral ligaments are torn from their metacarpal attachments, the phalanx carrying with it the glenoid ligament and sesamoid bones. The head of the metacarpal bone passes between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis, and the tendon of the long flexor slips to the ulnar side. The phalanx passes on to the

328 THE NERVES. of raising the arm, and of the finer movements in writing or sewing (Thorburn). The circumflex nerve is frequently damaged in injuries in the region of the shoulder. The deltoid muscle is paralysed and wastes rapidly, and the arm cannot be raised to the hori- zontal position. The sub-scapular nerves may be injured at the same time, leading to paralysis of the muscles supplied by them. Bilateral paralysis of the deltoid has followed sleeping with the arms raised and the hands clasped behind the head. Musculo-Spiral Nerve.—In virtue of its anatomical relation- ships this trunk is more exposed to injury than any other nerve in the body. It is frequently compressed against the humerus in sleeping with the arm rest- ing on the back of a chair, especially in the deep sleep of alcoholic intoxication (drunkard’s palsy). It may be pressed upon by a crutch in the axilla, by the dislocated head of the humerus, and by violent squeezing of the upper arm, as when an elastic tourniquet is applied too tightly. The most serious and permanent injuries of the nerve are associated with fractures of the humerus, especially those from direct violence attended with comminution. The nerve may be crushed or torn by one of the fragments at the time of the injury, or at a later period may be compressed by callus. Clinical Features.-—It is impossible to tell clinically whether the nerve is torn across or merely compressed. The patient often complains of numbness and of tingling in the distribution of the radial nerve, but anesthesia is usually slight or absent, which may be explained by the fact that the radial side of the hand is occasionally innervated by the median nerve (Kennedy). The motor symptoms predominate, the muscles affected being the extensors of the wrist and fingers, and the supinators. If the lesion is high up, as it is, for example, in crutch paralysis, Fig. 60.—Drop-Wrist from Musculo-Spiral Paralysis, the result of wound of upper arm.

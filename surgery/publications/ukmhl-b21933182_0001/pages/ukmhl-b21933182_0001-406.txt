There is severe pain in the region of the insertion of the tendo Achillis, and the movements at the ankle-joint are restricted. The patient is lame, and may be unable to walk when the feet are bare. A tender swelling forms on either side of the tendon. When, in spite of palliative treatment, the affection persists or relapses, it is best to excise the bursa. A flap of skin is raised from the posterior aspect of the heel, the tendo Achillis is split longitudinally, and the bursa dissected out. If there is a bony projection from the os calcis, as sometimes occurs, it should be shaved off with the chisel.

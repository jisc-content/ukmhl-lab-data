HALLUX RIGIDUS. 727 of the abductor hallucis may require to be divided sub- cutaneously. Hallux Rigidus and Hallux Flexus (Fig. 256).—These terms indicate two stages of an affection of the metatarso- phalangeal joint of the great toe first described by Davies Colley. In the earlier stages—hallux rigidus—the great toe is stiff and incapable of being dorsi-ffexed. Plantar-flexion is, as a rule, less restricted. In some cases the joint, in addition to being stiff’, is painful, sensitive and swollen—hallux dolorosus. As the disease progresses the toe is drawn towards the sole and becomes permanently flexed—hallux flexus—and any attempt at dorsi-flexion is attended with pain.

The condition is chiefly met with in adolescent males, is very commonly associated with flat-foot, and is then usually bilateral. The patient’s gait, in addition to having the characteristic features associated with flat-foot, is peculiarly wooden and inelastic, as instead of rising on the balls of the toes with each step, he puts down and lifts the sole as if it were a rigid plate. The pain is increased by walking. The boot tends to become worn away at the point of the toes and at the pos- terior edge of the heel, and the usual crease across the dorsum is absent. On dissection it is found, especially in hallux flexus, that the inferior portions of the lateral ligaments are contracted, and that the cartilage of that part of the head of the metatarsal which is

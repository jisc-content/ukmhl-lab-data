CHAPTER VIII. BACTERIAL AND OTHER WOUND INFECTIONS. Erysipelas—Diphtheria—Tetanus—Hydrophobia—Anthrax—Glanders— Actinomycosis—Mycetoma—Delhi boil—Chigoe—Poisoning by insects —Snake bites. Erysipelas. Erysipelas is an acute spreading inflammation of skin or mucous membrane due to the action of a streptococcus. The organism was at one time believed to be Specific as regards this disease, and was called by Eehleisen the streptococcus erysipelatis, but it is now generally accepted that it is the ordinary strepto- coccus pyogenes “ of a certain degree of virulence,” although the conditions which so modify it that it causes erysipelas are as yet not fully understood. Infection invariably takes place through an abrasion of the surface, although this may be so slight that it escapes observation even when sought for. With our improved methods of wound treatment, erysipelas very rarely attacks an operation wound. When it does occur it is usually in wounds about the face and mouth, where it is impossible to carry out antiseptic precautions perfectly. The streptococci are found most abundantly in the minute lymph spaces of the affected tissue, and in the serous blebs which sometimes form on the surface, but they never invade the blood-stream. Microscopically, four zones are to be recognised from without inwards in a patch of erysipelatous inflammation. (1) Just beyond the reddened area is a zone in which active spread is taking place, all the lymphatic spaces being crowded with rapidly-multiplying streptococci; (2) the margin of the red area is in a state of acute inflammation, and the lymph spaces are crowded with leucocytes, many of which have streptococci in their interior; (3) in a zone internal to this the inflammatory signs are less marked, and all the free cocci have disappeared; 103

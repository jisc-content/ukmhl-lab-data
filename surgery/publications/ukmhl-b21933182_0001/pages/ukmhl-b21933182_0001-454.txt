The forearm is then supported by a third handkerchief applied as a sling, the base of which is placed under the elbow, the ends passing over the sound shoulder. Operative treatment may be called for in compound or comminuted fractures when the fragments have injured, or are Fie. 93.—Chiene’s Method of treating Fracture of Clavicle.

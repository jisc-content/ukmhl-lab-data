485 DISLOCATIONS OF THE THUMB. The dorsum of the metacarpal, where it is held erect by the tension of the abductor and adductor muscles. The attitude of the thumb is characteristic (Fig. 134). metacarpal is adducted, its head form- ing a marked prominence on the front of the thenar eminence, and the phalanges are displaced backwards and more or less flexed upon one another. Many explanations of the difficulty so often experienced in reducing this variety of dislocation have been offered, but the consensus of opinion now seems to be that it is due to the interposition of the glenoid ligament and the sesamoid bones between the phalanx and the metacarpal, and that this is most fre- quently the result of ill-advised efforts at reduction. In some cases the tension of the lonu: flexor tendon Fig. 134.—Backward Dis- location of Metacarpo-Phal- angeal Joint of Thumb. may be a factor, but the “ button-holing ” by the short flexor is probably of no im- portance. Reduction is to be effected by flexing and adducting the metacarpal while the phalanx is hyperextencled and pushed down towards the joint and levered over the head of the metacarpal. When this manipulation fails, the glenoid ligament should lie Fig. 135.—Reduction of Dislocation of Thumb with aid of “ Indian Puzzle.” divided longitudinally through a puncture made with a tenotomy knife on the dorsal aspect of the joint, so as to separate the sesamoid bones and permit the passage of the head between them. An open operation is seldom necessary.

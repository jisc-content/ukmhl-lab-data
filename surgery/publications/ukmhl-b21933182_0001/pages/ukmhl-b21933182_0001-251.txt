227 CHAPTER XIII. CONSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS OF INJURIES. Syncope — Shock — Collapse — Delirium in Surgical Patients: Delirium in general; Delirium Tremens ; Traumatic Delirium— Fat Embolism. Syncope, Shock, and Collap.se. Syncope, shock, and collapse are clinical conditions which bear a superficial resemblance to one another, although depending on different causes. Syncope is essentially due to a sudden cerebral anaemia; shock results from a reflex paralysis of the vasomotor centre in the medulla; while the cause of collapse is the abstraction of fluids from the solid tissues and the blood. Syncope or Fainting.—Syncope is the result of a suddenly- produced anaemia of the brain, from temporary arrest of the heart’s action. In surgical practice this condition is usually observed in nervous persons who have been subjected to pain, as in the reduction of a dislocation or the incision of a whitlow; or in those who have rapidly lost a considerable quantity of blood. It may also follow the sudden withdrawal of fluid from a large cavity, as in tapping an abdomen or evacuating an empyema. Fainting sometimes occurs also during the adminis- tration of chloroform, especially if there be a tendency to sickness and the patient is not completely under. Its occurrence during an operation is usually attended by the cessation of oozing from the divided vessels in the wound. Clinical Features.—When a person is about to faint he feels giddy, has surging sounds in the ears, and haziness of vision; he yawns, becomes pale and sick, and a free flow of saliva takes place into the mouth. The pupils dilate; the pulse becomes small and almost imperceptible; the respirations shallow and hurried; consciousness gradually fades away, and he falls in a heap on the floor.

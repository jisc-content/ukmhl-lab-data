579 SYPHILITIC DISEASES OF BONE. by pyogenic infection. The result is either a crumbling away of the affected bone by caries, or the death of considerable portions which are separated as sequestra, so that unsightly deformity is often produced. Syphilitic disease of the tibia may be taken as the type of the affection as it occurs in the long bones. Gummatous disease in the periosteum may result in the formation of a well-defined node, or the whole shaft may become the seat of an irregular nodular enlargement, becoming denser and heavier than normal. If a periosteal gumma breaks down and spreads towards the skin, the latter is destroyed, and a syphilitic ulcer with carious bone at the bottom results (Fig. 195). A central gumma may eat away the surrounding bone until it is so weakened that it readily undergoes pathological fracture. In the rare cases in which it attacks the articular ends of the long bones gummatous disease may implicate the adjacent joint and give rise to syphilitic arthritis.

CONGENITAL DISLOCATION OF THE HIP, 689 Of the many views which have been expressed regarding its etiology, that of Hoffa appears to us the most feasible. He believes that the dislocation takes place in the early months of intra-uterine life, and is probably associated with deficiency of the liquor amnii. It is predisposed to by the flexed and adducted attitude of the lower extremities of the foetus in utero, and as a result of the elastic pressure of the wall of the uterus, the 'head of the femur is displaced and grows past the acetabulum. The acetabulum, in the absence of the head of the bone, does not develop properly, but remains flattened and shallow, so that Fig. 235.—Tracing of Radiogram of Congenital Dislocation of Hip. when the child comes to put its weight on the limb, the head of the femur is pushed upwards and lies against the ilium. The greater frequency of the dislocation in the female is probably due to the fact that in the female foetus the acetabulum faces the lateral aspect of the pelvis, while in the male it is directed more forwards. Pathological Anatomy.—The anatomical changes in the parts concerned vary in children of different ages. At birth the head of the femur lies just above the acetabulum, and when the child begins to walk it is, under the influence of the weight of the body, pushed still higher, till it comes to lie immediately outside the anterior superior spine. The head of the femur is often elongated or conical, its articular surface uneven, and it may be VOL. I—44

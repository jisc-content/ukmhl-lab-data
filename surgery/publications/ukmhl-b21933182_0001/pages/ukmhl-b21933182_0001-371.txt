It attacks the lower extremity or the external genitals in either sex (Fig. 64). The disease is usually ushered in with fever, and signs of inflammation in the part affected, of the nature of Fig. 64.—Elephantiasis of Penis and Scrotum in native of Demerara. (Mr. Annandale's case.) lymphangitis. After a number of such attacks, the lymphatic vessels appear to become obliterated, and the skin and subcuta- neous cellular tissue, being bathed in stagnant lymph,—which possibly contains the products of streptococci,—take on an over- growth, which continues until the part assumes gigantic propor- tions. In a certain number of cases the lymphatic trunks have been found to be blocked with the ova of the filaria sanguinis hominis or with the parent worms. It must be clearly understood, however, that sporadic cases of elephantiasis of the lower extremity are met with in this country in which there are no filarial parasites in the lymphatics. These sporadic cases present features indis-

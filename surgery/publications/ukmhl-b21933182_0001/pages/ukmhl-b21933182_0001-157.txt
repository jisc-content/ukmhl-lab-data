Bleeding from the wound should be encouraged, and, if necessary, incisions may be made for this purpose. The applica- tion of an Esmarchâ€™s elastic bandage from above downward to empty the blood out of the infected portion of the limb has been recommended. The whole of the bite should at once be excised, and the raw surface treated with a solution of permanganate of potash or peroxide of hydrogen, which destroys the poison by oxidation. The general treatment consists in free stimulation with whisky, brandy, ammonia, digitalis, etc. Hypodermic injections of strychnine in doses sufficiently large to produce a slight degree of poisoning by the drug are particularly useful. The most rational treatment, when it is available, is the use of the antivenin introduced by Fraser and Calmette.

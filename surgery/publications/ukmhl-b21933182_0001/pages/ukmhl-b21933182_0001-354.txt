In the hand it supplies the opponens, the abductor and the outer head of the short flexor of the thumb, and the two radial lumbricals, so that wherever the nerve is injured these muscles are apt to be affected. The thumb remains in an extended and abducted position and cannot be opposed to the tips of the fingers, and there is wasting of the ball of the thumb. In those cases in which the nerve is injured above the origin of the branches to the muscles in the forearm, the hand cannot be pronated, and the wrist cannot be flexed except to the ulnar side. The patient is unable to flex the second phalanges on the first or to flex the distal phalanx of the index and middle fingers. He can, however, flex at the knuckles by the action of the interossei. The extent of the anesthesia is variable; it may or may not correspond to the normal distribution of the nerve to the radial side of the Fig. 61.—Claw-hand following Division of Ulnar Nerve above Wrist. palm, the palmar aspect of the radial three and a half lingers, and the dorsal aspect of the last phalanx of the same fingers. The skin of the finger tips and the nails may suffer from trophic changes (Fig. 13). The Ulnar Nerve.—The most common injury of this nerve is its division in accidental wounds just above the wrist. In the upper arm it may be contused, along with the musculo-spiral, in crutch paralysis. In the groove behind the elbow it may be contused by a blow, or compressed or torn in fractures of the internal condyle of the humerus, or it may be divided in excising the joint, In the forearm it supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris and the ulnar half of the flexor profundus digitorum; and in the hand, the short muscles of the little finger, the interossei, the two ulnar lumbricals, the adductor, and inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. When divided just above the wrist, owing to the resulting

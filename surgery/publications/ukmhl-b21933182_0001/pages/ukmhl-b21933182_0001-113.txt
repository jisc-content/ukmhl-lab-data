89 CHAPTER VII. GANGRENE. Definition — Clinical types: Dry, Moist — Clinical varieties—Gangrene primarily due to interference with the circulation : Physico-chemical group; Embolic gangrene; Senile gangrene, atheroma; Diabetic gangrene ; Gangrene from angeio-sclerosis ; Gangrene from ergot; Eaynaud's disease ; Gangrene after acute fevers—Gangrene primarily due to bacterial infection : Acute traumatic gangrene; Malignant oedema ; Cancrum oris; Phagedcena—Bed-sores. The term gangrene is used to indicate the process by which a portion of tissue dies en masse, as distinguished from the molecular or cellular death which constitutes ulceration. The dead portion is known as a slough. Gangrene may occur in any tissue of the body, and portions of limbs, of intestine, of lung, penis, or even of brain tissue, may die en masse and be thrown off as sloughs. In this chapter we shall confine our attention to the process as it affects the limbs and superficial parts of the body, leaving gangrene of the viscera to be described in regional surgery. Clinical Types of Gangrene. Two distinct types of gangrene are met with clinically, which, from their most obvious point of difference, are known as dry and moist gangrene respectively. We shall have to study each of these types in detail; but, speaking generally, it may be said that dry gangrene is essen- tially due to a simple interference with the blood-supply of a part; while an essential factor in the production of moist gan- grene is bacterial infection. Several clinical varieties of each type are met with, but before describing these we shall first study the fundamental distinctions between the two types. Dry Gangrene or Mummification is a comparatively slow

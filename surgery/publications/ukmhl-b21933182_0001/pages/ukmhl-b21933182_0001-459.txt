435 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. the proportion of female sufferers increases. They are usually attended with great pain, and there is often numbness of the arm due to pressure of the head of the bone upon the large nerve trunks. There is sometimes considerable shock. The patient inclines his head towards the injured side, and while standing the forearm is supported by the hand of the opposite side. The acromion process stands out prominently, the roundness of the shoulder giving place to a flattening or depression immediately below it, so that a straight edge applied to the outer aspect of the limb touches both the acro- mion and the external condyle. The vertical circumference of the axilla is markedly increased. The head of the bone is to be felt in its new position, and the direction of the humerus is correspond- ingly altered, the elbow being carried from the side — for- ward or backward according to the position of the head. The empty glenoid may some- times be palpated from the axilla. In most cases, al- though not in all, the patient is unable at one and the same time to bring his elbow to the side and to place the hand upon the opposite shoulder (Dugas’ symptom). Accurate measurements of the length of the limb from acromion to external condyle are not easily made, and are rarely of any diagnostic value. The sub-coracoid dislocation (Fig. 97) is that most frequently met with. It usually results from hyper-abduction of the arm while the scapula is fixed, as in a fall on the inner side of the elbow when the arm is slightly abducted from the side. The surgical neck of the humerus is then brought to bear upon the under aspect of the acromion, which forms a fulcrum, and the head of the humerus is pressed against the inner and lower part of the capsule. In some cases muscular action produces this Fig. 97.—Sub - coracoid Dislocation of Shoulder. Note flattening of shoulder, increase in depth of axillary fold, and congestion of veins of arm. «

DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE. 517 Dislocations of the Knee. Dislocation of the knee occurs only as a result of extreme degrees of violence, especially of a wrenching or twisting character. Antero-posterior dislocations are more common than those which are lateral, and are more frequently complete. A con- and the facet for the fibula, is also rare. It usually occurs between the ages of three and nine. The displacement is for- ward or lateral, and is accompanied by the usual signs of such lesions. The growth of the limb is sometimes arrested, and shortening and angular deformity may result (Fig. 158). Treatment.—After being reduced under an anaesthetic these fractures are usually satisfactorily treated in a box splint (Fig. 168), carried sufficiently high to control the knee-joint. When the head of the tibia is comminuted light weight exten- sion—three or four pounds— is beneficial. Movement and massage are commenced within a few days, and at the end of a fortnight the patient is allowed up with crutches, wearing a moulded splint of poroplastic, or plaster of Paris. Avulsion of the tubercle of the tibia occasionally occurs in youths, from violent contraction of the quadriceps—as in jump- ing. The limb is at once ren- dered powerless, and the osseous nodule can be felt, and on mov- ing it crepitus is elicited. This is best treated by peg- ging the tubercle in position, and fixing the limb on an in- clined plane to relax the quad- riceps muscle. The upper end of the fibula is seldom broken alone. Its chief clinical interest lies in the fact that it may implicate the musculo-cutaneous branch of the Fig. 158.—Separation of Upper Epiphysis of Tibia of old standing. external popliteal nerve.

BURNS AND SCALDS. 219 infection is very liable to result and to lead to wide destruction of the surrounding skin. The amount of granulation tissue necessary to fill the gap is therefore great; and as the epithelial covering can only be derived from the margins—the skin glands being completely destroyed—the healing process is slow. The resulting scars are irregular, deep and puckered, and show a great tendency to contract. Keloid frequently develops in such cicatrices (Fig. 41).

The patient recovered. neck, or flexures of joints, much deformity and impairment of function may result (Figs. 42, 43). In burns of the fifth degree the lesion extends through the subcutaneous tissue and involves the muscles; while in those of the sixth degree it passes still deeper and implicates the bones. These burns are comparatively limited in area as they are usually produced by prolonged contact with hot metal or caustics. Burns of the fifth and sixth degrees are sometimes met with in epileptics who fall into the fire during a fit. Large blood- vessels, nerves, trunks, joints, or serous cavities may be implicated. General Phenomena.—It is customary to divide the clinical history of a severe burn into three periods; but it is to be observed that the features characteristic of the periods have been

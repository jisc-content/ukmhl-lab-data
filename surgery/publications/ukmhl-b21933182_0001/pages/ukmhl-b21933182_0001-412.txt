388 INJURIES OF BONES. if* Sub-periosteal fractures are those in which, although the bone is completely broken across, the periosteum remains intact. These are especially common in children, and as the thick periosteum prevents dis- placement, the existence of a fracture may be over- looked, even in such a bone as the femur. A bone may be broken at several places, constitut- ing a multiple fracture (Fig. 80). Separation of bony pro- cesses, such as the coracoid process, the epicondyle of the humerus, or the tuber- osity of the os calcis, may result from muscular action or from direct violence. Separation of epiphyses will be considered later. (2) According to the Direc- tion of the Break.—Trans- verse fractures are those in which the bone gives way more or less exactly at right angles to its long axis. These usually result from direct violence or from end to end pressure. Longitudi- nal fractures extending the greater part of the length of a long ’.bone are exceed- ingly rare. Oblique frac- tures are very common, and result usually from indirect violence, bending, or torsion Fracture of Humerus (Figs. 82, 83). Spiral frac- tures result from forcible torsion of a long bone, and are met with most frequently in the tibia, femur, and humerus (Fig. 81). (3) According to the Relative Position of the Fragments.—The bone may be completely broken across, yet its ends remain in apposition, in which case there is said to be no displacement.

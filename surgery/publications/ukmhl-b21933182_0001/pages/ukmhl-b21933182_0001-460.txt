43G INJURIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. dislocation, the mechanism being the same as when it is due to indirect violence. It may also result from force directly applied in the region of the shoulder. The head leaves the capsule through the rent made in its lower part, and, either from a continuation of the force, or from the contraction of the muscles inserted into the bicipital groove, particularly the great pectoral, passes inwards under cover of the biceps and coraco-brachialis till it comes to rest against the anterior surface of the neck of the scapula, just below the coracoid process. The ana- tomical neck of the humerus presses against the anterior edge of the glenoid, and there is fre- quently an indenta- tion fracture of the head of the humerus where the two bones come into contact (F. M.Caird). Thesub- scapularis is bruised or torn, the muscles inserted into the great tuberosity are greatly stretched, or the tuberosity itself may be avulsed, allowing the long Flo. 98.—Kocher’s Method of reducing Sub-coracoid tendon of the biceps to slip outwards, where it may form Dislocation—First Movement : tion of Arm.

The clinical features common to all dislocations are prominent, although Dugas’ symptom is not constant. Treatment.—It must ever be kept in mind that the guiding principle in the reduction of these dislocations is to make the head of the bone retrace the course it took in leaving the socket. The main obstacles to reduction being muscular contraction and the entanglement of the head with tendons, ligaments, or bony points ; appropriate means must be taken to counteract each of these factors.

389 FRACTURES. There may be an angular displacement—for example, in green- stick fracture ; or the ends may overlap one another, although they do not completely part company. In transverse fractures of the patella or of the olecranon there is often distraction or pulling apart of the fragments (Fig. 161). The broken ends, especially in oblique frac- tures, may override one another, and so give rise to shortening of the limb. Where one fragment is acted upon by powerful muscles a rotatory displacement may take place, as in frac- ture of the radius above the insertion of the pronator radii teres, or of the femur just below the small tro- chanter. The fragments may be depressed, as in the flat bones of the skull or the nasal bones. At the cancellated ends of long bones, particularly the up- per end of the femur and humerus, and the lower end of the radius, it is not uncommon for one fragment to be impacted or wedged into the substance of the other (Fig. 143). Causes of Displacement. —The factors which influ- ence displacement are chiefly mechanical in their action. Thus the direction and nature of the fracture play an important part. Trans- verse fractures with roughly serrated ends are less liable to displacement than those which are oblique with more or less smooth surfaces. The direction of the causal force also is a dominant factor in determining the direction in which one or B, rA Fig. Fig. 82. — Oblique Fracture of Upper Third of Tibia with Fissuringof Lower Fragment.

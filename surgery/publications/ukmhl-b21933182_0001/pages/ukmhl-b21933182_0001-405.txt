There is pain and tenderness referred to the ligament, the patient is unable to extend the limb, the tubercle of the tibia is apparently enlarged, and there is a fluctuating swelling on either side of the ligament, most marked in the extended or semiflexed position of the limb.

It is usually of the nature of a simple hydrops, form- ing a fluctuating egg- or sausage- shaped swelling at the inner side of the popliteal space. It is flaccid in the flexed, and tense in the extended position of the limb. As a rule it causes little inconvenience and may be left alone. Otherwise it should be dissected out, and if there is a ~0 ,, . , „ . communicatxon with the knee-joint branosus Bursa, this should be closed with sutures. An adventitious bursa may form over the external malleolus, especially in tailors, giving rise to the condition known as “tailor’s ankle” (Fig. 79).

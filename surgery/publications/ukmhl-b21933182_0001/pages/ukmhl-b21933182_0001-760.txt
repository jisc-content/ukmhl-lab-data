The after-treatment consists in massage and passive movements, and a splint may be worn at night until there is no longer any tendency to recontraction. In recent years excision of the affected portions of fascia has been successfully practised, and although a tedious operation it yields satisfactory and permanent results. Supernumerary Fingers (Polydactylism).—These may coexist with supernumerary toes, and the condition is often met with in several members of the same family.

In the majority of cases it should be removed. Congenital Deficiencies in the Number of Fingers.—One or more fingers may be entirely absent, such deficiency being often associated with imperfect development of the hand and forearm, or they may be represented by short rounded stumps, these being usually ascribed to the strangulation of the digits by amniotic bands in utero—the so-called intra-uterine amputation. Webbing of Fingers (Syndactylism).—Congenital webbing or fusion of the fingers may be associated with polydactylism or with congenital hypertrophy, and, like other digital deformities,

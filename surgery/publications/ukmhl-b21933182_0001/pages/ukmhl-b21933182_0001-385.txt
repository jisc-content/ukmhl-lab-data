Contusion of Muscle. — - The violence which causes bruising of a muscle may act from without, as in blows, kicks, or falls; or from within, as by the displacement of a bone in fractures and dislocations. The lesion consists in rupture of blood-vessels and of muscle fibres. The symptoms are those common to all contusions. The patient complains of severe pain on attempting to use the muscle, and maintains an attitude which will relax it. There is sub- cutaneous ecchymosis if the sheath of the muscle also is torn; sometimes the accumulation of blood results in the formation of a hsematoma. Repair is usually satisfactory; but when the nerve supplying the muscle is bruised at the same time, as is frequently the case in the deltoid, wasting and loss of function may be very per- sistent. In exceptional cases the process of repair may be attended with the formation of bone in the substance of the muscle. Treatment consists in rest and the application of cotton wool and a bandage—followed, after an interval, by active movements, massage, and the use of the continuous current. Sprain of Muscle.—This lesion consists in overstretching and partial rupture of the fibres of a muscle or its aponeurosis. It is of common occurrence in those who follow laborious occupa- tions and in athletes. It may follow upon a single or on

466 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. complicated by a fracture. The joint surfaces become welded together by adhesions, and separated fragments often form attachments which completely lock the joint. Attempts to break these down are attended with considerable risk of re- fracturing the bone or of tearing soft parts. In such cases it is best to expose the joint by incision and to remove sufficient bone to provide a movable and useful joint. Dislocation of the ulna alone is a very rare injury, and is usually associated with fracture of one or other of its processes or of the internal condyle. Dislocation of the radius alone, on the other hand, is com- paratively common, especially as a concomitant of fracture of the upper third of the shaft of the ulna. mi a blow on the he radius, a fall in children, from rm while in the aced head usually the anterior edge the radius can be felt to rotate with the shaft in its abnormal position, a depression is felt below the external condyle, where the head should be, and the cup-shaped depression on the head is slightly shortened. In a few cases the displacement of the head has been back- ward or outward. Treatment.—To effect reduction the forearm should be flexed and supinatecl, while traction is made upon it from the wrist. At the same time the lower end of the humerus and the head of the radius are pressed backward. When reduction is prevented by the interposition of a portion of the torn liga- ments between the bones, it is sometimes necessary to open the joint to ensure accurate adjustment. The joint is fixed in acute flexion by a posterior moulded splint for about three of the capitel- lum, thus pre- venting com- plete flexion and supination of the limb.

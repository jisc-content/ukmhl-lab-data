98 GANGRENE. part to be spontaneously separated. This takes place so slowly, however, that the majority prefer to amputate early. In this connection it is worthy of note that there are certain points at which gangrene naturally tends to become arrested— namely, at the highly-vascular areas in the neighbourhood of joints. Thus gangrene of the great toe often stops when it reaches the metatarso-phalangeal joint; or if it trespass this limit it may be arrested either at the tarso-metatarsal or at the ankle joint. If these be passed it usually spreads up the leg to just below the knee before signs of arrestment appear. Further, it is seen from pathological specimens that the spread is greater on the dorsal than on the plantar aspect, and that the death of skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of bone and muscle. These facts furnish us with valuable indications as to the seat and method of amputation. Experience has proved that in senile gangrene of the lower extremity reliable and satisfactory results are only to be obtained by amputating in the region of the knee, care being taken to perform the operation so as to leave the prepatellar anastomosis intact by retaining the patella in the anterior flap. The operation recommended is disarticulation at the knee by means of a circular incision carried round the limb, about three inches below the tubercle of the tibia, the joint being fully extended (A. G. Miller). Gritti’s supra-condylar amputation is also suitable. Haemorrhage is easily controlled by digital pressure, and the use of a tourniquet should be dispensed with, as the constriction of the limb is liable to interfere with the vitality of the flaps. When the tibial vessels can be felt pulsating at the ankle it may be justifiable, if the patient urgently desires it,''to amputate lower than the knee; but in the great majority of

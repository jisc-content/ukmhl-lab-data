v PREFACE. In the preparation of this work we have endeavoured to furnish a systematic view of the present-day aspects of Surgery in sufficient detail to render it useful to the practitioner, without at the same time carrying it beyond the scope appropriate to a Manual for Students. We have curtailed as far as possible the discussion of theoreti- cal and debatable matter, and have only described pathological processes in so far as they bear directly on diagnosis and treat- ment. We have not considered it advisable to describe or illustrate histological appearances, as these are more appropri- ately dealt with in a textbook of Pathology. The description of the Injuries and Diseases of individual tissues and organs have been arranged with a view to facilitate clinical study, and with the same object a brief resume has beer given of the Surgical Anatomy of the tissue or region concerned. With a few exceptions the illustrations are original, and appear in these pages for the first time. To our colleagues in the Edinburgh School, and to our other friends who have so generously aided us in this matter, we desire here to tender our sincere thanks. We would also acknowledge our indebtedness to Sir William Turner for permission to photograph specimens in the Anatomical Museum of the University of Edinburgh; and to the Museum Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh for a similar privilege.

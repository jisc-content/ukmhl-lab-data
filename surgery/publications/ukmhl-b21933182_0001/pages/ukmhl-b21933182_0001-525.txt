FRACTURES OF THE NECK OF THE FEMUR. 501 this is maintained by means of a padded triangular bandage passed through the perineum and fixed to the upper end of the splint. This method is less efficient and more uncomfortable than that by weight and pulley. Eversion may be corrected by sand-bags placed alongside the 1 imb; or by means of a piece of wood fixed to the back of the knee at right angles to the axis of the limb by a few turns of plaster-of-Paris bandage. It is important also to keep the bed- clothes clear of the foot by means of a cage. The retentive apparatus is worn for about six weeks, after which the patient is allowed to go on crutches. In view of the unsatisfactory results obtained by the ordinary methods of treating fractures through the narrow part of the neck, recourse may be had to ac- curate fixation of the fragments to one another by means of a long steel peg in- troduced through the skin over the great trochanter, and passed so as to transfix the two fragments. Fracture immediately below the lesser trochanter may be produced by direct or by indirect violence, and the displacement depends largely on whether the line of fracture is transverse or oblique. The upper fragment is tilted forward and rotated outward by the ilio-psoas muscle and the external rotators inserted in the region of the great trochanter. The lower fragment is pulled upward and rotated outward by the flexors and adductors, the weight of the limb aggravating the eversion, upper fragment may be increased by the Fig. 147.—Long Splint with Perineal Band. The tilting of the lower fragment pushing it forward. On account of the difficulty of controlling the short upper fragment, union is liable to take place with considerable shortening and deformity (Fig. 148). Treatment.—When it is found, under chloroform, that the displacement can be completely reduced, and the fragments kept in accurate apposition by carefully padded local splints, this

463 DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW. of the forearm are displaced towards the inner side as well as backward (Fig. 116). Clinical Features.—The elbow is held fixed at an angle of about 120°, pronated or midway between pronation and supina- tion. Any attempt at movement causes great pain, and is followed by an elastic rebound to the abnormal position. The antero-posterior diameter of the joint is increased, and the forearm, as measured from the external condyle to the tip of the styloid process of the radius, is shortened to the extent of about an inch. If examined before swelling ensues the outlines of the Fig. 116.—Tracing of Radiogram of Incomplete Backward and Inward Dislocation of Elbow. articular surfaces may be recognised in their abnormal positions. Great swelling usually comes on rapidly, and, by obscuring the bony landmarks of the joint, renders the diagnosis difficult. This injury has to be diagnosed from supra-condylar fracture with backward displacement, and from separation of the lower humeral epiphysis. A general anaesthetic is often necessary to enable an accurate diagnosis to be made. When the deformity is once reduced, there is no tendency to its reproduction unless the coronoid process is at the same time fractured. In a considerable number of cases—according to E. H. Bennett, in the majority—this dislocation is incomplete, the coronoid process resting at the level of the trochlea, and the backward projection of the olecranon being scarcely appreciable. The

The small round-celled sarcomata are among the most malignant tumours of bone, growing with great rapidity, and giving rise to secondary growths at a very early stage. The second group includes the fibro-, osteo-, and chondro- Fig. 204.—Central Sarcoma of Lower End of Femur, invading the knee-joint.

Surgeons, Edinburgh.) sarcomata, and combinations of these, in all of which fully formed tissue predominates over the cellular elements of the growth. They grow chiefly from the deeper layer of the periosteum, and project in the first instance from the surface, but later tend to surround the bone (Figs. '203 and 205). They also invade the interior of the bone from which they are growing, filling up the marrow spaces with a white, bone-like substance, and in the case of the flat bones of the skull may traverse the cliploe and erupt on the inner table. The tumour tissue nearest the bone forms a dense, white, structureless basis, from which

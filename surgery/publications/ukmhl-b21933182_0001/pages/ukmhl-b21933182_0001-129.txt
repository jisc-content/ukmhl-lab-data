Clinical Features.—Two clinical varieties are met with—the acute and the chronic bed-sore. The acute bed-sore (Fig. 22), usually occurs over the sacrum or buttock. It comes on very rapidly after spinal injuries and in the course of certain brain diseases. The part affected becomes red and congested, while the surrounding parts are oedematous and swollen. Blisters form, and the skin loses its vitality and dies. In advanced cases of general paralysis of the insane, a peculiar Bed-Sores. Bed-sores are most frequently met with in old and debilitated patients, or in those whose tissues are devitalised by acute fevers or by such chronic diseases as lead to venous stasis. Any interference with the nerve-supply of the skin, whether from injury or disease of the central nervous system or of the peripheral nerves, strongly predisposes to the formation of bed- sores.

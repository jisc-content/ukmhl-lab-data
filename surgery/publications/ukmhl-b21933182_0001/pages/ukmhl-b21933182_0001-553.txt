FRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE LEG. 529 or no displacement, and such as there is is angular, and is determined by the direction of the fracturing force. When the violence is indirect, as from a fall on the feet, or a twist of the foot, the tibia usually gives way at the junction of its lower and middle thirds, and the fibula at a higher level (Fig. 166). Torsion of the leg is probably the most important factor in the production of the fracture, the lower fragment being fixed by the pressure of the foot HI, jgf ft J upon the ground, while the upper fragment is rotated by the impetus of the body. Both fractures are usually oblique—that in the tibia running from above down- ward, forward, and inward, and it is generally found that the obliquity of the fibular fracture corresponds with that in the tibia. Muscular contraction alone may produce fracture of both bones, or may aug- ment the twisting force. There is usually con- siderable displacement. The upper fragments pro- ject forwards, while the lower fragments tend to move backwards under the influence of gravity and the traction of the calf muscles. The calf muscles pull up the heel and point the toes, and the weight of the foot causes it to fall outwards. On account of the superficial position of pointed character of the fragments, this fracture is frequently rendered compound by the bone coming through the skin. The projecting piece of bone is usually the lower end of the upper fragment. This fracture is also very often comminuted. It has been observed that when the line of fracture forms the letter V on the subcutaneous surface of the tibia, there is invariably a VOL.

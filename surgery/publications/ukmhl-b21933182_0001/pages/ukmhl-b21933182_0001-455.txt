DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. 431 likely to injure, the subclavian vessels or the cords of the brachial plexus, or when it is otherwise impossible to reduce the fracture or to retain the fragments in apposition. It is also indicated in some cases of simultaneous fracture of both clavicles. Silver wire or silk-worm gut is the most suitable material for suture. After the wound has healed, massage and movement are employed, as in simple fractures. Dislocations of the Clavicle. Dislocations of the acromial end—sometimes, and perhaps more correctly, spoken of as dislocations of the scapula—are Fig. 94.—Dislocation of Acromial End of Left Clavicle upwards. more frequent than those at the sternal end. This injury usually results from a blow from behind driving down the scapula, so that the clavicle projects upwards and overrides the acromion process (Fig. 94). The doionward displacement of the outer end of the clavicle is very much rarer, and may follow a fall on the elbow or a blow over the clavicle. The end of the bone lies in contact with the capsule of the joint, and under the acromion process, which stands out prominently. At the sternal end the most common displacement is forward— the backward and upward dislocations being rare.

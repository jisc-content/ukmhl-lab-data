348 THE SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE. tinguishable from tlie tropicalâ€™variety, and usually follow upon repeated attacks of lymphangitis or erysipelas. The part affected with elephantiasis is enormously increased in size, and causes inconvenience from its bulk and weight. In contrast to ordinary dropsy, there is no pitting on pressure. The skin tends to become rough and warty, and may hang down in pendulous folds. Blebs may form on the surface and yield an abundant exudate of clear lymph. From neglect of cleanliness, the skin may be- come the seat of eczema or even of ulceration attended with foul discharge. The treatment consists in maintaining an aseptic con- dition of the part, combating the inflammatory attacks, and reducing the swelling by eleva- tion of the limb, massage, and the use of an elastic bandage. Removal of the overgrown tissues is commonly practised in elephantiasis of the external genitals, but is rarely indicated in the lower extremity. A similar type of elephant- iasis may occur in the upper or lower extremity after extir- pation of all the lymphatic glands in the axilla or groin ; in the leg in long-standing varixand phlebitis with chronic ulcer; in the arm as a result of extensive cancerous disease of the lymphatics; in the axilla secondary to cancer of the breast; and in extensive tuberculous disease of the lymphatics. The last-named is chiefly observed in the lower limb in young adult women, and from its following upon lupus of the toes or foot it has been called lupus elephantiasis (Fig. 65). The tuberculous infection spreads very slowly up the limb by way of the lymphatics, and as these are obliterated the skin and cellular tissue become hypertrophied, and the surface studded over with fungating tuberculous masses of a livid-blue colour. As the disease may prove dangerous to life by septic complications inducing Fig. 65.- - Lupus Elephantiasis of Left Lower Extremity. (Sir P. H. Watson's case.)

GANGLION. 201 old-fashioned seton. The overlying skin and cyst wall are transfixed by a stout curved needle carrying a double thread of thick silk-worm gut, the ends of which are cut short, and a dressing applied. A week later the threads are removed and the minute punctures sealed with collodion. The action of the threads is to excite an aseptic granulation of the cyst wall, which results in its obliteration. Where this fails, recourse should be had to excision. Puncture with a tenotomy knife, and scraping the interior, and the injection of irritants, are alternative, but less satisfactory, methods of treatment. The so-called “ compound palmar ganglion ” has been shown to be a tuberculous disease of the tendon sheaths, and will be described with the diseases of tendon sheaths

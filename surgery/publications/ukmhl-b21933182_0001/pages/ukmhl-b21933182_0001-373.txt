349 SEBACEOUS CYSTS, gangrene of the limb, the question of amputation may have to be considered in advanced cases. Belonging to this group also is a form of congenital elephan- tiasis resulting from the circular constriction of a limb in utero by amniotic bands. Elephantiasis occurring apart from lymphatic or venous obstruction is illustrated by elephantiasis nervorum, in which there is an overgrowth of the skin and cellular tissue of an entire extremity in association with neuro-fibromatosis of the cutaneous nerves; and by elephantiasis Groecorum—a form of leprosy in which the skin of the face becomes the seat of tumour-like masses consisting of leprous nodules. It is also illustrated by elephantiasis involving the scrotum as a result of Fio. 66.—Multiple Sebaceous Cysts or Wens. the prolonged irritation of the urine in cases in which the penis has been amputated and the urine has been allowed to infiltrate the scrotal tissues. Sebaceous Cysts.—Atheromatous cysts or wens are retention cysts formed in relation to the sebaceous glands and hair follicles. They are commonly met with in adults, on the scalp (Fig. 66), face, neck, back, and external genitals. Sometimes they are multiple, and they may be met with in several members of the same family. They are smooth, discoid cysts, varying in size from a split pea to a tangerine orange. In consistence they are firm and elastic, or fluctuating, and are incorporated with the overlying skin, but are movable on the deeper structures. The orifice of the partially blocked sebaceous follicle may be visible (except on the scalp), and some of the contents of the cyst can be squeezed through the opening. The wall of the cyst is

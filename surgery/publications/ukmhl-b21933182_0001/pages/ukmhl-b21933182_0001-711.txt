687 THE ANKLE-JOINT. is proposed to inject iodoform emulsion, the point of the needle is inserted below either malleolus, and is then pushed upwards along the astragalus. Abscess is treated on the usual lines. If localised disease in one of the bones is recognised before the joint is infected it should be eradicated by operation. The patient is allowed to go about with crutches or a Thomas’ knee splint if articular symptoms are absent or have subsided. When the disease is diffuse and resists conservative treatment, operation must not be delayed. The choice lies between arthrectomy and excision. In excising the joint the articular surfaces of the constituent bones are removed, and it may be necessary to take away the whole of the astragalus. Amputation should be restricted to rapidly progressing disease in adults with diffuse suppuration and visceral tuberculosis, and to cases which have relapsed after excision. Whatever method of amputation is employed, it is essential that the infected tissues should be completely removed to avoid recrudescence in the stump, which would necessitate re-amputation at a higher level. The other diseases of the ankle include pyogenic, gonorrhoeal, rheumatic, gouty and hysterical affections, arthritis deformans, and Charcot's disease. The last-named is generally associated with a rapid and painless disintegration of the bones of the ankle and tarsus, resulting in great deformity and loss of the arch of the foot—sometimes associated with perforating ulcer of the sole. Tuberculous disease in the tarsus and metatarsus has been considered in the general article on diseases of bone.

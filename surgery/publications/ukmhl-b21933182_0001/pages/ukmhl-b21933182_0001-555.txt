FRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE LEG. 531 being carried out from the first. When the fracture is in the lower third of the leg the ambulatory splint (Fig. 171) gives excellent results, and is of special service in hospital practice. This splint allows of a certain amount of movement of the muscles, and it is usually found when it is removed at the end of three or four weeks that the ankle is freely movable and there is no atrophy of muscles. When the fracture is oblique and it is difficult to retain the fragments in position, or when there is great swelling with bullae or bruises on the skin, a splint which can easily be taken off and replaced is to be preferred. One of the simplest and most efficient is the Box Splint (Fig. 168). This consists of two pieces of wood extending from above the knee to an inch or two beyond the sole, and a little broader than the maximum Fig. 167.â€”Recent Fracture of both Bones of Leg in Lower Third by direct violence. diameter of the leg. These are rolled into the opposite ends of a folded sheet so as to form two sides of a box, of which the sheet constitutes a third side. It is often found advantageous to insert another board, fitted with a foot-piece, between the folds of the sheet forming the third side of the box, to add to the rigidity of the splint, and to aid in controlling the foot. By folding one side of the sheet somewhat obliquely, the box is made a little wider at the knee than at the ankle, and so fits the limb more accurately. The limb is placed in this box, the sides of which have been carefully padded. Pressure is taken off the condyles, the head of the fibula, the malleoli and the tip of the heel by ring pads, and a large supporting pad is placed behind the tendo Achillis. A folded towel is laid over the front of the leg, forming a lid to the box, and the whole is bound to the limb by three slip knots. Finally the foot is fixed at right angles to the leg by a

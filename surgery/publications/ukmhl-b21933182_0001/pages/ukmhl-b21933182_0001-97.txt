CAUSES OF ULCERS. 73 Ulcers due to Interference with Nerve-supply.—Any inter- ference with the nerve-supply of the superficial tissues pre- disposes to ulceration. For example, trophic ulcers are liable to occur in injuries or diseases of the spinal cord, in cerebral paralysis, in limbs weakened by infantile paralysis, in ascend- ing or peripheral neuritis, or after injuries of nerve-trunks (Fig. 13). It is believed by some that the common chronic ulcer of the leg is dependent upon altered trophic innervation, as well as upon changes in the venous circulation. The acute bed-sore is a very rapidly progressing form Fro. 14.—Perforating Ulcer on the Foot of a woman set.

The ordinary pressure bed-sore, although not necessarily associated with defective nerve-supply, may be so. The perforating \dcer of the foot is a peculiar type of sore which occurs in association with the different forms of peripheral neuritis, and with various lesions of the brain and spinal cord, such as general paralysis, locomotor ataxia, or syringo-myelia. It also occurs in patients suffering from glycosuria (Fig. 14). Perforating ulcer is met with most frequently under the head of

It is best demon- strated by drawing one straight line between the anterior iliac spines, and another to meet it from the ensiform cartilage through the umbilicus. If the pelvis is in its normal or horizontal position, the two lines intersect one another at right angles; if it is tilted, the angles at the point of intersection are unequal. The flexion of the thigh may be largely compensated for by increasing the forward curve of the lumbar spine Fig. 223.—Disease of Left Hip—disappearance of lordosis on flexion of the joint. (lordosis) and by flexing the leg at the knee. To demonstrate the lordosis the patient should be laid on a flat table ; when the thigh is flexed the lumbar spine is in contact with the table (Fig. 223); when the thigh is extended the spine arches forwards so that one may insert the hand or the closed fist beneath it (Fig. 224). There may also be an attempt to compensate for the eversion of the limb by rotating the pelvis forwards on the affected side. If the functions of the joint are tested, it will be found that there is more or less rigidity, and that both active and passive movements take place at the lumbo-sacral junction instead of at the hip. While rigidity is usually absolute as regards rota-

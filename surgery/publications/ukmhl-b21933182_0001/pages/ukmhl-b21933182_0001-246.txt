INJURIES. 222 area is gently, but thoroughly, washed with a mild antiseptic lotion, such as warm boracic or weak lysol, followed by sterilised saline solution. As pyogenic bacteria are invariably found in the blisters of burns, these must be opened and the raised epithelium removed. The dressings subsequently applied should meet the following indications : the relief of pain ; the prevention of sepsis ; and the promotion of cicatrisation. The application which most satisfactorily fulfils these requirements is picric acid, which is applied to the surface as a watery solution—made up of picric acid, 1J drams; absolute alcohol, 3 ounces; distilled water, 40 ounces. Pads of lint or gauze are lightly wrung out of the solution and applied over the whole of the reddened area. These are covered with antiseptic wool, without any waterproof covering, and retained in posi- tion by a many-tailed bandage.

The dressing should be changed once or twice a week, any portion of the original dressing which remains perfectly dry being left undisturbed. The value of a general anaesthetic in dressing extensive burns, especially in children, can scarcely be overestimated. Picric acid yields its best results in the more superficial burns, but is useful as a primary dressing in all. As soon as the sloughs separate and a granulating surface forms, the ordinary treatment for a healing sore is instituted (p. 79). A slough under which pus has collected should be cut away with scissors to permit of free drainage.

FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE. 429 domette bandage in place of the adhesive plaster. A layer of wool is placed in the axilla to keep the skin surfaces apart. It must not be used as a fulcrum to lever out the shoulder, as the pressure thus produced on the axillary vessels and nerves is liable to cause congestion, and numbness or pain in the limb beyond. A wide loop is then made on the end of the bandage, and passed round the middle of the upper arm (Fig. 91), care being taken that the limb is not constricted. The arm is pulled backward by carrying the bandage across the back, under the opposite axilla, and round the thorax as far as the elbow. It is next looped round the back of the elbow, close above ABC Fig. 92.—Attitudes of Limb according to Displacement in Chiene’s Method. the condyles, and by being carried across the front of the chest to the opposite shoulder pulls the elbow forward and inwards, and so levers the shoulder backward and outward on the fulcrum formed by the loop round the upper arm. The next turn corrects the downward displacement by passing across the back, under the tip of the elbow—a slit being made in the bandage opposite the olecranon process—and along the forearm to the opposite shoulder. A circular body bandage is applied over all these turns, and safety-pins inserted at the crossings. Chiene’s Method.—“ In employing this method there are two points to be attended to—the position in which the arm is to be kept, and the method of, applying the bandage. The more

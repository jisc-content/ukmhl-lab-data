528 INJURIES IN REGION OF KNEE AND LEG. the bone is rotated so that its edge rests on the front of the femur—vertical dislocation (Fig. 164); and in a few cases it has been completely turned round, so that the articular surface is directed forwards. Clinical Features.—The joint is fixed, usually in a position of slight flexion, and the displaced patella can readily be palpated. The deformity is a very striking one, and at first sight suggests a much more serious injury. Although easily reduced, the dislocation is liable to recur. To effect reduction, the quadriceps must be thoroughly relaxed by extending the leg upon the thigh and flexing the thigh upon the pelvis. If the patella be now tilted by making firm pressure on that edge of it which lies furthest from the middle of the joint, and at the same time pushed towards the middle line, it usually slips into position without difficulty. The limb is placed Fig. 164.—Vertical Dislocation of Patella. on a posterior splint, and firm elastic pressure made on the joint to prevent or diminish effusion. Massage and movement are carried out from the first. As the displacement is liable to recur, the patient should wear a firm elastic bandage or a strong knee-cap. Permanent and recurrent dislocations of the patella will be described in the chapter on deformities. Fractures of the Bones of the Leg. The bones of the leg may be broken together or separately. Fracture of both Bones.—The nature of the violence pro- ducing this injury plays an important part in determining its anatomical and clinical features. Fracture by direct violence, such as the passage of a wheel over the limb, or a severe blow, may occur at any level, the bones giving way at the point of impact. The line of fracture tends to be transverse, both bones being broken at the same level (Fig. 165). There is often little

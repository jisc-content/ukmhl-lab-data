FRACTURES OF THE PATELLA. fixed to the foot piece of the splint (Fig. 162). The bandage which binds the limb to the splint should make upward pressure on the lower fragment, or this may be done by a special piece of adhesive plaster with elastic tubing pulling in an upward direction. The retentive apparatus is kept on for about six weeks, and the knee must not be flexed lest the fibrous tissue be stretched. A rigid but easily removable apparatus is thereafter applied, and the patient allowed up on crutches, the limb being massaged daily to improve the tone of the muscles. Old-standing Frac- tures.—When the use- fulness of the limb is seriously impaired from want of union, or on account of the length of the fibrous band connecting the frag- ments (Fig. 161), it may be necessary to perform secondary sut- ure. The operation is carried out on the same lines as that for recent fracture, the ends of the bones being rawed Fig. 163.—Old-standing Fracture of Patella and adhesions divided. with wide separation of fragments. It is sometimes neces- Tl'e patient was able to follow his occupation as a dock-labourer. sary to lengthen the quadriceps muscle by making a number of V-shaped incisions through its substance, before the fragments can be approximated. When operative treatment is contra-indicated, the patient should be fitted with a firm apparatus which will limit flexion of the knee and support the fragments. Dislocations of the patella are rare. They result from exaggerated muscular movements when the limb is in the fully extended position, or from a blow on one or other edge of the bone. Laxity of the ligaments and knock-knee are pre- disposing factors. The outivard is the most common variety—the inward being very rare. Either may be complete or incomplete. Sometimes

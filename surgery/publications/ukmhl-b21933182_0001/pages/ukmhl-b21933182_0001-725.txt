The legs being abducted, the weight of the body falls unequally on the outer and inner parts of the ossifying junctions, with the result that there is inequality of growth and consequent persistence and increase of the deformed attitude. In adolescents there are also changes at the ossifying junctions similar to those met with in rickets, and NORMAL Fig. 242. the determining factor is again a faulty attitude of the limbs in standing and walking. Pathological Anatomy.â€”Examination of the bones in knock- knee shows that in some cases the lower third of the diaphysis of the femur is lengthened on its inner side and shortened on its outer side, and that the epiphysis, itself unaltered, is fitted on to the diaphysis obliquely, so that the internal condyle appears to be increased in length and to occupy a level distinctly below that of the external condyle. In other cases the tibia shows corresponding alterations. On section of the bones the epiphysial cartilage and the zone of ossification are wider, thicker, and more

464 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. head of the radius, however, is unduly prominent. In such cases the lesion is liable to be overlooked, and therefore to go untreated, leading to permanent impairment of function of the joint. Dislocation forward is much less common than the backward variety. It is produced by severe force acting from behind on the flexed elbow, the ulna being driven forward, tearing the ligaments of the joint and the muscles attached to the condyles. The olecranon process is frequently fractured at the same time. When it remains intact it may rest below the con- dyles (incomplete or first stage of dislocation), or may pass in front of them, especi- ally if the triceps be rup- tured (complete or second stage). The forearm is lengthened, the elbow slightly flexed, the posterior aspect of the joint flattened, and the condyles and ole- cranon, in their abnormal relationship, can be pal- pated from behind. Lateral Dislocations. —Dislocation towards the ulnar side—inward—is al- ways incomplete, some por- tion of the articular surface of the bones of the forearm remaining in contact with the condyles. The radial or outward dislocation is also incomplete as a rule, although cases have been recorded in which complete separation had taken place. Both forms of lateral dislocation are rare, the inward variety being that more frequently observed. Each form is often combined with other injuries in the region of the joint. The most common cause of these dislocations is a fall on the outstretched hand, the forearm at the moment being strongly pronated. Forced abduction favours the inward displacement, adduction the outward. The limb is held flexed and pronated, and the facility with which the bony points can be palpated renders the diagnosis easy.

They are indolent and painless, and rarely attract attention until they break down and form abscesses, which are usually about the size of a cherry, and when these burst sinuses or ulcers result. If the overlying skin is still intact the best treatment is to excise the tumours. If the abscess Fig. 63.—Multiple Tuberculous Abscesses of Skin. lias already infected the skin, each focus should be scraped, swabbed out with pure carbolic acid, and packed with gauze.

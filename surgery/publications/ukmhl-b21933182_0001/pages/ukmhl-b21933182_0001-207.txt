INNOCENT CONNECTIVE-TISSUE TUMOURS. 183 the fibrous capsule which surrounds it. On section it is usually of a greyish-blue colour and semi-translucent. The tumour is firm and elastic in consistence, but certain portions may be as hard as bone from calcification or ossification, while other portions may be soft and fluctuating as a result of myxomatous degenera- tion and liquefaction. These tumours grow slowly and painlessly, and in the course of their growth may surround nerves and arteries without injuring them (Fig. 200). They may cause a deep hollow in the bone from which they originate. All intermediate forms between the innocent chondroma and the malignant chondro-sarcoma are met with. Chondromata may occur in a multiple form, especially in relation to the phalanges and metacarpal bones (Fig. 199). When growing in the inte- rior of a bone a chondroma causes a spindle-shaped enlarge- ment of its shaft, which in the case of a phalanx or metacarpal bone may resemble a tuberculous or syphilitic dactylitis. Treatment.—In those projecting from the surface of a bone, both the tumour and its capsule should be removed. If in the interior, a sufficient amount of the cortex should be removed to allow of the tumour being scraped out, and care must be taken that no nodules of cartilage are left behind.

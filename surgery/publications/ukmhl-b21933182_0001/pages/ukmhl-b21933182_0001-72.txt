Suppuration, or the formation of pus, is one of the results of the action of certain bacteria on the tissues of the body. The invading organism is usually one of the staphylococci, less frequently a streptococcus, and still less frequently one of the other bacteria capable of producing pus, such as the bacillus coli communis, the gonococcus, the pneumococcus, or the typhoid bacillus. So long as the tissues are in a healthy condition they are able to withstand the attacks of moderate numbers of pyogenic bacteria of ordinary virulence, but when devitalised by disease, by injury, or by inflammation due to the action of other pathogenic organisms, suppuration ensues. Pus.—The fluid resulting from the process of suppuration is known as pus. In its typical form it is a yellowish creamy substance, of alkaline reaction, with a specific gravity of about 1030, and has a peculiar mawkish odour. If allowed to stand in a test-tube it does not coagulate, but separates into two layers, an upper, transparent, straw-coloured fluid, the liquor purls or pus serum, closely resembling blood serum in its composition, but containing less proteid and more cholesterin. It also contains leucin, tyrosin, and certain albumoses which prevent coagulation. The solid constituents form a layer at the bottom of the tube, consisting largely of dead leucocytes and fixed tissue cells (pus corpuscles). Red corpuscles, micro-organisms, fibrin,

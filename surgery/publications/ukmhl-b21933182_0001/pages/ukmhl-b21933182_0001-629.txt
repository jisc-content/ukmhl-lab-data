Definition of Terms. — The term synovitis is applied to in- flammatory conditions which are confined to the synovial membrane. It is often associated with effusion into the cavity of the joint, which may be serous, sero-fibrinous, or purulent. The term synovitis, however, should always be used along with some qualifying adjective—-such as gouty, gonorrhoeal, or tuberculous—which indicates its distinctive pathological nature. Hydrops, hydrarthrosis, and chronic serous synovitis are terms employed when the effusion of fluid into the joint is the most prominent clinical feature. Hydrops may occur apart from disease,—dor example, in the knee-joint, from repeated sprains,—but is chiefly met with in the chronic and intermittent forms of synovitis resulting from gonorrhoea, tuberculosis, syphilis, arthritis deformans, or arthropathies of nerve origin. It may also occur when there are loose bodies in a joint. Arthritis is the term applied when not only the synovial membrane but the ligaments, articular surfaces, and it may be also the ends of the bones, are involved in the disease. As in speaking of synovitis, so in using the term arthritis it is necessary to prefix a qualifying adjective which indicates its nature. According to its etiology, arthritis may assume a dry form or may be attended with effusion into the joint; and this effusion may lie serous, as in arthritis deformans, or sero-fibrinous

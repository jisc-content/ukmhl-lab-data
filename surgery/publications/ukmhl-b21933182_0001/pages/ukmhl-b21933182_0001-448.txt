424 INJURIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. of the triangular depression bounded by the pectoralis major, the deltoid, and the clavicle. JTfie head and surgical neck of the humerus may now be felt from the axilla, if the axillary fascia be relaxed by bringing the arm to the side. The great tuberosity can be indistinctly felt on the outer aspect of the shoulder through the fibres of the deltoid. It lies vertically above the external condyle, and may be recognised to rotate with the shaft. The bicipital groove looks forward, and lies in a line drawn vertically through the biceps muscle. The subclavian artery, with its vein to the inner side and the cords of the brachial plexus to the outer side, passes under the middle of the clavicle, and may be compressed against the first rib immediately above this bone. Fractures of the Clavicle. Fracture of the clavicle is one of the commonest injuries met with in practice. As about one-third of the cases occur in Fig. 87.â€”Recent Oblique Fracture of Right Clavicle in Middle Third. Upper figure shows sawn section. Lower figure shows superior aspect of bone. children, the fracture is often of the greenstick variety. These fractures are seldom compound or complicated, unless as a result of gunshot injuries; but occasionally the fragments pierce the skin, or press upon the subclavian vessels or the cords of the brachial plexus. Both clavicles may be fractured simultaneously. The most common situation is in the middle third (Fig. 87). This usually results from indirect violence, such as a fall on the outstretched hand, the elbow, or the outer aspect of the shoulder, the force being transmitted through the glenoid cavity to the scapula, and thence by the coraco-clavicular ligaments to the clavicle. The violence is, therefore, of a twisting character, and the bone gives way near the junction of the outer and

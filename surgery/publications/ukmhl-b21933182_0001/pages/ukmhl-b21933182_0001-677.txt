THE ELBOW-JOINT. 653 atecl with disappearance of the upper end of the humerus (Fig. 219). The Elboav-Joint. In disease of the elbow the usual attitude is that of flexion with pronation of the hand. Swelling of the joint, whether from effusion of fluid or from thickening of the synovial membrane, is chiefly perceived on the posterior aspect, above and on either side of here nearest the sur- face. In relation to disease of the elbow- joint, the free com- munication between the elbow and the superior radio - ulnar joint should be borne in mind. Tuberculous dis- ease is the most com- mon and important (Fig. 220). While it usually occurs under twenty, it may be met with at any age, and even in old people. When the disease is confined to the syn- ovial membrane its onset is very insidious. There is little or no pain, and no interfer- ence with any move- ment except complete extension. The only evidence of disease is the development of a white swelling on either side of and above the olecranon, obscuring the bony landmarks. The further progress is attended with wasting of the triceps, symptoms of involvement of the articular surfaces, and with abscess formation. The occurrence of articular caries without swelling of the synovial membrane is exceptional, and is associated with a good deal of pain and considerable restriction of movement. Rigidity from muscular contraction occurs late, and is rarely complete. Tuberculous foci in the bones are chiefly met with in the upper end of the ulna and the lower end of the humerus; they may the olecranon, because the synovial sac is Fig. 220.â€”Diffuse Tuberculous Thickening of Synovial Membrane of Elbow (White Swelling).

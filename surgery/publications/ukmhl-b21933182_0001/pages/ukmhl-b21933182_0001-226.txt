A contusion or bruise is a laceration of the subcutaneous soft tissues, without solution of continuity of the skin. When at the same time the integument gives way, a contused wound results. Bruising occurs when force is applied to a part by means of a blunt object, whether in the form of a direct blow, a crush, or a grazing form of violence. Violence acting at right angles to the part tends to produce localised lesions extending deeply, while forces acting obliquely to the surface give rise to lesions which are more diffuse, but com- paratively superficial. It is well to remember that those suffering from scurvy or haemophilia (bleeders), and fat and anaemic females, are liable to bruising or ecchymosis from comparatively trivial injuries. Clinical Features.—Three degrees of contusion are recognised, in all of which discoloration and swelling are the predominant features. Contusions of the first degree (contusion with ecchymosis) are characterised by the occurrence of numerous minute and discrete punctate haemorrhages scattered through the superficial layers of the skin, which is slightly oedematous. The effused blood is rapidly reabsorbed. Contusions of the second degree (contusion with extravasation) are those most commonly met with. The extravasated blood may be widely diffused through the cellular tissue of the part, especially where this is loose and lax, as in the region of the orbit, the scrotum and perineum, and on the chest-wall. A blue or bluish-black discoloration occurs in patches varying in size

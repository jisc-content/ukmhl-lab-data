650 CHAPTER XXX. DISEASES OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. The Shoulder-Joint. Disease is rare in the shoulder in comparison with other joints, and as a rule is met with in adults. In young subjects infective processes implicating the joint result chiefly from extension of disease from the upper epiphysial junction of the humerus, which is partly included within the limits of the synovial cavity. The synovial membrane, in addition to lining the capsular ligament, is frequently prolonged down the bicipital groove around the long tendon of the biceps, and pus or other fluid may escape from the joint by means of this diverticulum and gravitate down the upper arm. There is frequently a communi- cation between the joint and the sub-deltoid bursa. There is no characteristic attitude in disease of the shoulder-joint, but the upper arm is usually held close to the side and rotated slightly inwards, while the elbow is carried a little backwards. Fixation of the shoulder-joint is largely compensated for by the free movement of the scapula on the thorax, and even when ankylosis occurs it is not so disabling as in other joints. In testing for rigidity the scapula should be fixed with one hand, while passive movements of the arm are carried out with the other. Swelling is rarely a prominent feature, except when there is a considerable quantity of fluid bulging the deltoid, or when there is an abscess outside the joint. More commonly the deltoid is atrophied, allowing the acromion, coracoid, and great tuberosity of the humerus to stand out prominently beneath the skin. Tuberculous Disease.â€”This is chiefly met with in young- adults, although it may occur at any age. It is more common in the right shoulder. The prominent features are pain, wasting of muscles, and rigidity. The pain may be severe,

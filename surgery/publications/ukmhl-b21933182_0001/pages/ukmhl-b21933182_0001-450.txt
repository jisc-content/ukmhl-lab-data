426 INJURIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. The patient is rendered helpless, and from the extrinsic muscles of respiration being thrown out of action, and the weight of the powerless limbs pressing on the chest, dyspnoea is a frequent accompaniment. Internal injuries often complicate these fractures. Fracture of the outer third, of the clavicle is much less common, and usually results from direct violence, the bone being driven down against the coracoid process, and broken as Fig. 89.—Fracture of Outer end of Clavicle. Shows forward rotation of outer fragment, and liue of fracture united by osseous callus. one breaks a stick over the knee. The fracture may take place at the level of attachment of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments, in which case the only symptoms are pain and tenderness at the seat of fracture, with impaired movement of the limb. Dis- placement and crepitus are prevented by the splinting action of the ligaments. When the break is external to the attachment of the trapezoid ligament, the fracture is usually transverse, and is almost always due to a fall on the back of the shoulder—the angle between Fig. 90.—Fracture of Inner End of Clavicle. (From a specimen in Professor Annandale’s collection.) the spine and the acromion process striking the ground. The outer fragment rotates forward (Fig. 89), sometimes even to a right angle, causing the tip of the shoulder to pass forwards, and so to lie slightly nearer the middle line. The integrity of the coraco-clavicular ligaments prevents any marked drooping of the shoulder. It is noteworthy that the displacement is not always evident at first. Fractures of the inner third are very rare, are usually oblique (Fig. 90), and result either from an indirect force acting in the

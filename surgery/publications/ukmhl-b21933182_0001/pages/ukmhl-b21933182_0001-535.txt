FRACTURES OF THE SHAFT OF THE FEMUR. 511 be employed after the first week. The retentive apparatus should be worn for from six to eight weeks, after which the patient is allowed up with crutches. The limb may be secured in a Thomas’ hip splint or a plaster-of-Paris case extending round the pelvis. In fractures near the lower end of the shaft a Thomas’ knee splint suits very well. This must be worn for three or four weeks. An efficient means of treating this fracture is by Hodgen’s splint. In infants and young'children the nursing is greatly facilitated by applying vertical ex- tension to both lower extremities. The fracture being usually transverse and showing little tendency to displacement, the local Gooch splints may often be dispensed with, or replaced by a few turns of starch bandage. Operative treatment is sometimes called for when simpler measures fail to reduce the dis- placement, and in cases of vicious union or un- united fracture. The incision, which must be free, is preferably placed on the outer aspect of the limb; the peri- osteum is interfered with little as possible ; Fig. 155.—Fracture of Thigh treated by Vertical Extension. and the endsof thebones are pegged, screwed or wired according to circumstances. The after treatment is carried out on the same lines as for simple fracture, but the retentive apparatus must be worn for a considerably longer period.

There iseburnation of the articular surfaces similar to that seen in other joints. These changes are neces- sarily associated with great Fig. 227.—The Upper End of the Femur in advanced Arthritis Deformans of Hip. showing absorption of neck and down- ward displacement of head of hone. (Museum of Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh.) restriction of the movements of the joint, and with striking deformity, which consists in shortening of the limb, usually with eversion—some- times with flexion and adduction. The trochanter is nearly always displaced upwards and backwards in relation to Nekton’s line. The clinical features are usually so characteristic that there is little difficulty in diagnosis. Restriction of the movements of abduction and adduction, the presence of cracking and of grating of the articular surfaces, and the aggravation of the pain and stiffness after resting the limb, are helpful in recognising arthritis de- formans. The prominence of sciatic pain from the nerve being involved as lead to the disease being regarded as Fig. 228.—The Upper End of the Femur in advanced Arthritis Deformans of Hip.

356 THE SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE. brown, when abundant it is a deep black. The most remark- able feature is the rapidity with which the disease becomes disseminated along the lymphatics, the first evidence of which is an enlargement of the lymphatic glands. As the primary growth is often situated on the sole of the foot (Fig. 70) or in the matrix of the nail of the great toe, the femoral and inguinal glands become enlarged in succession, forming tumours much larger than the primary growth. Sometimes the dissemination in- volves the lymphatic vessels of the limb, forming a series of indurated pigmented cords and nodules (Fig. 71). Lastly, the dissemination may be universal throughout the body, and this usually occurs at a com- paratively early stage in the disease, although it has been delayed in some cases for several years. The secondary growths are deeply pigmented, being usually of a coal-black colour, and melanin pigment may be present in the urine. The treatment consists in early and free removal of the primary growth, and of the associated lymphatic glands — whether these are enlarged or not. In the great majority of cases, when seen by the surgeon the disease is so far ad- vanced that operative treatment holds out but little prospect of saving life. Secondary Cancer of the Skin. — Cancer may spread to the skin from a subjacent growth by direct continuity or by way of the lymphatics. Both of these processes are well illustrated in cases of Fig. 70. — Melanotic Cancer of Sole of Foot.

Sarcomata of various types are met with in the skin. The

There is a decided tendency to spontaneous disappearance of these varieties, fully 50 per cent undergoing natural cure. This usually begins about the period of the first dentition, sometimes at the second dentition, and sometimes about puberty. On the other hand, an increased activity of growth may be shown at these periods. The onset of natural cure is recognised by the tumour becoming firmer and less compressible, and in the mixed variety, by the colour Fig. 49.—Large Mixed Nsevus of Cheek in child set. ; the Skin is only slightly involved.

Subcutaneous naevi may in later life develop arterial con- nections, leading to the formation of one of the forms of cavernous angioma. Treatment. — Bearing in mind the frequency with which subcutaneous and mixed naevi disappear spontaneously, active treatment is only called for when the growth of the tumour is out of proportion to that of the child, or when from its situation —-for example, in the vicinity of the eye—it is liable to do harm in its growth. Of the numerous methods of treatment which have been devised, it is only necessary to refer to the application of escharotics, electrolysis, and excision.

GANGRENE. 94 are also those clue to the pressure of a fractured bone or of a tumour on a large artery or vein. When gangrene occurs from such causes it tends to be of the moist type. Much commoner is it to meet with localised areas of sloughing due to the excessive pressure of splints over bony prominences, such as the external malleolus, the internal condyle of the humerus or femur, or over the dorsum of the foot. This is especially liable to occur when the nutrition of the skin is depressed by any interference with its nerve-supply, such as follows injuries to the spine or peripheral nerves, diseases of the brain, or infantile paralysis. On removing the splint the part pressed upon is found to be of a pale yellow Fig. 18.—Carbolic Gangrene. Girl aet. 22. Carbolic compress (1 in 60) applied over night.

If purified and protected from sepsis the slough behaves in the same way as that resulting from direct mechanical violence. Closely allied to this is the bed-sore in which sloughs of the skin and soft parts often form, and expose the bone. These will be described at the end of this chapter. Treatment.—The first indication in the treatment of the above varieties of gangrene is the exclusion of bacteria by thorough purification of the damaged tissue and its surroundings, and the application of dry, non-irritating antiseptic dressings. When these measures are successful dry gangrene ensues. The raw surface left after the separation of a slough of the skin may

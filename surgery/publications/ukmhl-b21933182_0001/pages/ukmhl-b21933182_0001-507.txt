BENNETT’S FRACTURE. 483 of function, full abduction and fine movements requiring close opposition of the thumb being specially interfered with. The treatment consists in careful reduction of the fracture by extension, and the application of an accurately fitting pad over the extremity of the displaced bone, maintained in position by a light angular splint (Fig. 131). This splint is first fixed to the extended and abducted thumb, and while extension is made by pushing it downwards the upper end is fixed to the wrist (Fig. 132a). The apparatus is worn for four weeks, being carefully readjusted from fctime to time to maintain the ex- tension. A moulded poroplastic splint applied on the same principle may be employed (Fig. 132b). Massage and movement should be commenced within a -few days of the injury. Fractures of phalanges usually result from direct violence, and on ac- count of the super- ficial position of the bones are often com- A B pound, and are at- Fig- 132.— A.

The proximal phalanges are broken oftener than the others. The deformity is usually angular, with the apex towards the palm, and if union takes place in this position, flexion and grasping are interfered with. Unnatural mobility and crepitus can usually be recognised, but, on account of the swelling and tenderness, diagnosis is sometimes very difficult. Firm union takes place in two or three weeks. In oblique and comminuted fractures union may take place with overlapping, producing a deformity which is sometimes troublesome by preventing the wearing of a glove or of rings. In compound fractures non- union sometimes occurs and causes persistent disability. In doubtful cases radioscopy renders valuable aid, as the parts are readily seen by the screen.

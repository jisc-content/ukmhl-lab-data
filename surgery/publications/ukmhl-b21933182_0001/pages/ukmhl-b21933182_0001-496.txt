Injuries in the Region of the Wrist. These include fractures of the lower ends of one or both bones of the forearm, or separation of their epiphyses; dislocations and sprains of the inferior radio-ulnar, and of the radio-carpal articulations ; and fractures and dislocations of the carpus. Surgical Anatomy.—The most important landmarks in the region of the wrist are the styloid processes of the radius and ulna. The tip of the radial styloid is palpable in the “anatomical snutf-box” between the tendons of the extensor brevis and extensor longus pollicis, and lies about half an inch lower than the ulnar styloid. The ulnar styloid is best recognised on making deep pressure a little below and in front of the head of the ulna, which forms the rounded subcutaneous prominence seen on the back of the wrist when the hand is pronated. The tubercle of the scaphoid and the trapezium can be felt at the base of the ball of the thumb, a little below the radial styloid ; while the pisiform and hook of the unciform are palpable, slightly below and in front of the ulnar styloid. In examining an injured wrist the different bony points should be located, and their relative positions to one another and to the adjacent joints noted. The particular shape, position, and relations of any un- natural projection or depression should likewise be carefully observed. The power and range of movement—active and passive—at the various joints should also be tested. Fractures of the Lower End of the Radius. Colles’ Fracture.—This is one of the commonest fractures in the body, and is especially frequent in women beyond middle age.

468 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. ised by severe pain over the insertion of the pronator radii teres during the act of pronation, and is due to stretching or tearing of the fibres of that tendon, and of the adjacent intermuscular septa. A similar injury—sculler’s sprain—occurs in rowing men from feathering their oars. The treatment consists in massage and movement, care being taken to avoid the movements which produced the injury. In persistent cases blistering may be useful. Fractures of the Forearm. The shafts of the bones of the forearm may be broken separately, but it is much more common to find both broken together. Fracture of both bones may result from a direct blow, a The line of fracture is usually transverse, both bones giving way about the same level. The common situation is near the middle of the shafts. In children greenstick fracture of both bones is a very frequent result of a fall on the hand—this indeed being one of the commonest examples of greenstick fracture met with. The displacement in complete fractures varies widely, de- pending partly upon the force causing the fracture, partly on the level at which the bones break and on the muscles which act on the respective fragments. It is common to find an angular displacement of both bones to the radial or to the ulnar side. In other cases the four broken ends impinge upon the inter- osseous space, and may become united to one another, preventing the movements of pronation and supination. There may be shortening from overriding of fragments. When the radius is broken above the insertion of the

It is especially common in the bones of the hand, often in a multiple form (Fig. 199). Its surface may be smooth or lobulated. Its consistence may be dense and elastic like normal cartilage, or it may present areas of softening or of bony hardness. The soft parts move freely over it, except in relation to the bones of the Fig. 199.—Multiple Chomlromata of Bones of Hand. (Anatomical Museum, University of Edinburgh.)

The femoral vessels pass through the substance of the tumour, and the sciatic nerve is adherent to its surface. fingers, where the skin may become adherent and ulcerate, and suggest a malignancy which does not exist. In more deeply seated bones the chondroma is not recognised so easily, and may be confused with sarcoma. Large tumours growing from the bones of the extremities may implicate the main vessels and nerves (Fig. 200), either simply surrounding them, or pressing on them injuriously so as to cause symptoms; they may also interfere with the movement of joints. The prognosis varies with the type of tumour : if innocent they grow very slowly, and may even become stationary. Rapid growth is an indication of malignancy.

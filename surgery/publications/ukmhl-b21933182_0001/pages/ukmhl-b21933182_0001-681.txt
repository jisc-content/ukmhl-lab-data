657 THE HIP-JOINT. socket becomes enlarged and elongated towards the dorsum ilii. To this progressive enlargement of the socket Yolkmann gave the suggestive name of “ wandering acetabulum.” These secondary changes are of clinical importance, the resulting dis- placement of the femur being one of the most important causes of real shortening of the limb in advanced cases of hip disease, especially when untreated. Clinical Features.—For convenience of description it is customary to divide these into three stages, which, however, merge into one another. There is usu- ally a well-marked stage of onset characterised by a limp, pain, and restriction of the movements of the joint; a second stage, in which the limb is abducted and apparently lengthened ; and a third stage, with ad- duction and apparent or actual shortening. The first of these stages may be absent, or may escape observation ; the second is very typical of hip disease, but may also be absent in cases of an acute type in which the attitude from the outset is one of adduction. Recovery often occurs before the disease reaches the third stage, or the treatment adopted may prevent the limb assuming stage. The formation of abscess may take place at any stage. Initial Stage.—At this stage the disease is still confined either to the synovial membrane, or to a focus in the bone which has not yet opened freely into the cavity of the joint. The onset is usually very insidious. If injury is alleged as an exciting cause, some weeks usually elapse between the receipt of the injury and the onset of symptoms. In the case of a child, he is usually brought for advice because he has begun to limp and to suffer pain. The statement may be made that he has VOL.

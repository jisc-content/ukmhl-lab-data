In uncomplicated paralysis of the calf muscles, the tendo Achillis may be reinforced by trans- planting into it the peronei or flexor longus digitorum. If the calf muscles are not com- pletely paralysed and the tendo Achillis is merely stretched, this tendon may be shortened by splitting it longi- tudinally and making the ends overlap, or its in- sertion may be displaced downwards. When the ankle is flail-like it may be necessary to perform arthrodesis. The cavus element in the deformity is also to be treated. Other forms of acquired pes calcaneus, such as those resulting from the contraction of scars on the dorsum, or from injury or disease of the lower end of the tibia, are occasionally met with and are to be treated on general principles. Pes Calcaneo-valgus.—This deformity, which consists in a combination of dorsi-flexion at the ankle and eversion of the foot, is fully as common as pure calcaneus (Fig. 251). The heel is depressed, the sole looks outwards, the arch of the foot is usually absent and its inner border is convex. Although it may be congenital, it is usually acquired as a result of infantile paralysis. The calf muscles are paralysed while the peronei retain their power, and along with the tibialis anticus and the extensors of the toes become secondarily Fig. 252.—Pes Cavus in association contracted.

Pes Calcaneo-varus.—In this deformity the heel is depressed and the sole of the foot looks inwards. It is very rare.

DISLOCATIONS IN REGION OF THE WRIST. 477 This injury is often complicated with fracture of the shaft or styloid process of the ulna, or dislocation of the radio-ulnar joint, and it is not infrequently compound. If the growth of the radius is interfered with, it results in a valgus condition of the hand, calling for resection of the lower end of the ulna. The treatment is the same as for Codes’ fracture. Fractures of the Lower End of the Ulna.—The lower end of the shaft of the ulna is seldom fractured alone. The styloid process, as has already been pointed out, is frequently broken in association with Codes’ and other fractures of the lower end of the radius. Separation of the lower epiphysis of the ulna, although a rare injury, is of clinical importance, in view of the fact that, like the radius, nearly the entire growth of this bone takes place at its lower end, and any interference with its epiphysis is liable to arrest its growth, producing a varus condition of the hand and bending of the radius. The treatment is similar to that for Codes’ fracture, but the hand is fixed in the position of ulnar flexion. Simultaneous separation of both epiphyses sometimes occurs, and, as a result of severe violence, may be compound, the lower ends of the diaphyses projecting through a wound on the dorsum. Fractures of Carpal Bones.- -The use of the Rontgen rays has shown that fracture of individual carpal bones is a some- what commoner injury than has hitherto been supposed. The scaphoid is broken more frequently than any of the others, usually by direct violence or by forced dorsi-flexion, but the clinical features are so obscure, and often so misleading, that an accurate diagnosis without the aid of the X-rays is seldom possible. In the majority of cases the fracture is compound, and associated with other injuries in the region of the wrist. The treatment of simple fractures consists in fixing the wrist and carpal joints by a palmar splint, the metacarpals being slightly liyperextended. Dislocations in the Region of the Wrist. The strong ligaments of the articulations about the wrist, the comparatively free movement at the various joints, and the relative weakness of the lower end of the radius whereby it is so frequently fractured, render dislocation a rare form of injury. Dislocation may occur at the inferior radio-ulnar, the radio carpal, mid-carpal, inter-carpal, or carpo-metacarpal joints. Dislocation of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation is seldom

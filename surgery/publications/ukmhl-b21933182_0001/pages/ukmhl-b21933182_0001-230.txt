INJURIES. 206 most appropriate. These stitches of coaptation may be inter- rupted (Fig. 38) or continuous (Figs. 36, 37). In small superficial ■wounds on exposed parts, stitch marks may be avoided by approximating the edges with strips of gauze fixed in position by collodion, or by subcutaneous sutures of fine catgut. When there is any difficulty in bringing the edges of the wound into apposition, a few interrupted “relaxa- tion stitches ” may be in- troduced wide of the mar- gins to take the strain off the coaptation stitches (Fig. 38). Stout silk, fishing-gut, or silver wire may be employed for this purpose. When the ten- sion is extreme, Lister’s button suture (Fig. 36) may be employed. Re- laxation stitches should be removed in four or five days, and stitches of coaptation in from ten to fourteen days. Stitches on the face and neck should be Fig. 36.—Continuous Suture, uniting Edges of Wound. Button Sutures of Relaxation.

Drainage.—In wounds in which no cavity has been left, and in which there is no reason to suspect septic infection, drainage is unnecessary. When the deeper parts of an extensive wound cannot be brought into accurate apposition, and especially when there is any prospect of oozing of blood or serum into the space left—as in amputation stumps or in such wounds as are left

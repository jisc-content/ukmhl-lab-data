CONGENITAL DISLOCATION OF THE HIP. G91 above Nelaton’s line. The head of the femur is absent from its normal situation, and may be felt just below or immediately to the outer side of the anterior superior spine. In young children, if the pelvis be fixed, the head of the bone may be made to glide upwards and downwards on the ilium. The pelvis is inclined forwards, and this is associated with flexion at the hi}) and well-marked lordosis of the lumbar spine (Fig. 237). The Fig. 236.—Congenital Dis- location of Right Hip in a girl set. 9.

The lordosis partially disappears when the child lies on its back, and the scoliosis disappears on equalising the length of the limbs by placing a flat object, such as a book, under the sole. In bilateral dislocation there is a more pronounced alteration in the attitude and gait of the patient. The trunk appears well grown in contrast to the short lower limbs, the lordosis of the lumbar spine is very marked, and is associated with undue prominence of the belly and of the buttocks. The gait is

147 CHAPTER X. SYPHILIS. Definition.—Acquired Syphilis—Primary period : Incubation, primary chancre, glandular enlargement, extra-genital chancres—Treatment —Secondary period: General symptoms, skin affections, 'mucous patches, affections of bones, joints, eyes, etc.—Treatment: Methods of administering mercury—Syphilis and marriage—Intermediate stage —Reminders — Tertiary period : General symptoms, gummata, tertiary ulcers, tertiary lesions of skin, mucous membrane, bones, joints, etc.—Second attacks.—Inherited Syphilis—Transmission— Clinical features in infancy, in later life—Contagiousness—Treat- ment. Syphilis is an infective disease due to the entrance into the body of a virus, the nature of which has not yet been definitely ascertained. It is nearly always communicated from one indi- vidual to another by contact infection, the discharge from a syphilitic lesion being the medium through which the virus is transmitted. It belongs to the group of diseases known as the infective granulomata, a group which includes tuberculosis, actinomycosis, glanders, and leprosy. Syphilis may be described as a chronic inflammation attended with the formation of granulation tissue which has certain structural peculiarities and degenerative tendencies. Syphilitic granulation tissue is made up of round cells, epithelioid cells, and giant cells, so like those met with in tuberculous lesions that a differential diagnosis based on histo- logical structure alone cannot be relied upon. It may be possible, however, to distinguish syphilitic from tuberculous granulation tissue by demonstrating tubercle bacilli in the latter. When syphilis is communicated from one individual to another by contact infection, the first visible sign of the disease appears at the site of inoculation, and is known as the 'primary sore. The disease is then spoken of as acquired syphilis. Individuals who have acquired the disease may transmit it to their offspring,

The second candidate was exa- mined first on protracted labour, on the dimensions of the foetal bead and of the pelvis, on haemorrhage before labour, on the treatment of placenta preevia, on conditions that would call for turning in labour, and in what degree of deformed pelvis this proceeding would be admissible. Then by the other examiner the same candidate was questioned on his defective answer on a case of uterine haemorrhage late in life, with cancer of the uterus and perimetritis. This candidate's examination lasted about half an hour. The examination of the third candidate was much of the same kind, and on the same subjects. The Visitors did not witness the examination of the other candidates at this table, but as they had done well in their previous work, their examination was short and rapidly gone through. Two out of the three candidates above referred to were rejected. During the examination by Mr. Lawson and Mr. Bryant in surgery, on the table were specimens of injuries and diseases of bone, a bladder with a large prostate, and a large sacculated aneurism. Each examiner gave a series of questions, and as the three candidates appeared to be insufiSciently prepared, about half an hour was spent upon each.

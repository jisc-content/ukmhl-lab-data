KEMAIIKS ON VISITATION-llEPORT. 284 Apoth. Hall, approval of the Visitors is therefore highly satisfactory to the Ibkland. Court. With regard to the remarks of the Visitors upon the Examinations in medicine and clinical medicine, the President and Members of the Medical Council are referred to the " Replies of the Examiners." The system of marking recommended at page 53 appears to be too stringent; to reject a candidate for a deficiency of five marks out of two hundred and fifty would be somewhat severe, but were a reasonable latitude allowed, the proposal meets the approval of the Court. The subject of mental disease frequently forms a part of the Examination in medical jurisprudence at the Hall, In conclusion, the Court desires to express its belief that the suggestions of the Visitors could be best carried out under a conjoint system of Examination By order^of the Court. THOMAS COLLINS, Governor. Dublin, May 16, 1882.

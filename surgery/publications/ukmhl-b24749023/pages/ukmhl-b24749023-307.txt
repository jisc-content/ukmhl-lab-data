295 VISITOES' OBSERVATIONS. The Visitors, having considered the various inaccuracies pointed out in the " BemarJcs of the Corporations," do not deem it necessary to notice them in detail, as they chiefly concern points of minor importance, and are adequately corrected by the publication of the Bemarks. On one inaccuracy only do they wish to comment, which is noticed by the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons of Edinburgh:— " In the ' Remarks on Examinations' on page 35, the Visitors say, ' There were no arrangements for testing the practical knowledge of the candidates by actual experiment.' This is quite erroneous; at every examination sets of unnamed sub- stances, reagents, and chemical apparatus are invariably laid out, and every candidate is required to show his knowledge by actual testing. The Visitors must have forgotten, when they made the above statement, that in the description of the chemical examination, they had used these words :— " ' He (the candidate) was then given a blue solution, which he successfully tested for sulphate of copper' (p. 108). "— Bemarhs, p. 31 (263). The inaccuracy here pointed out is clearly an oversight. The words used by the Visitors ought to have been, " There were no adequate arrangements, &c.," as it is the opinion of the Visitors that any testing of practical chemistry during an oral examina- tion of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes chiefly occupied by question and answer must be inadequate as a practical test, and that, if practical chemistry is to be an essential part of a chemical examination, it ought to be conducted in a laboratory

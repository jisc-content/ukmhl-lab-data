The application of bandages and splints to he required oj every candidate. The curriculum of the College distinctly requires, in the course of " Practical Surgery," evidence of instruction in the application of splints and bandages, besides an evidence of dressership. In the Pass Examination, moreover, candidates are liable to be, and many are, called upon to display competency in the use of such apparatus. 3. The examination of normal and morbid urine by every can- didate in the Medical Examination. In the Medical Examination at the College, in its present extended form, including a Cliuical Examination of patients, every candidate is liable to be called upon to test healthy and morbid urine. 4. The limitation of time in the Oral Examination and the method of marking. â€¢ 5. The economy of time to be obtained by excluding candidates rejected in the Written from appearing at the Oral Examination. These questions have been dealt -with under the same heads relating to the Primary Examination.

In the last column, at the top of page 55, for the words " Pinal, not limited," the words, " Final limited to 5 years, but re-eligible," should be substituted. T.

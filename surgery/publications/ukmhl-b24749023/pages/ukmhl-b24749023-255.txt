EOYAli COLI.EGR OF SORQEONS IN IRELAND. 243 is the likelihood of the same cases being repeatedly selected, owing E. Coll. to their being more easily procurable—a forcible commentary upon this is contained at pages 130-31 of the Report of the Visitors. The Council may add that the plan of bringing patients from the hospitals to the College has been already tried by this College, and was discontinued, in consequence of its ineflBciency. In reply to the remarks of the Visitors upon the Examination in Physiology as conducted in this College, the Council is of opinion that it is not expedient to enforce on candidates intended, as a rule, for the general practice of the Profession, too extended a study of the more abstruse departments of Physiological Science—on this point coinciding in the doubts expressed at page 21 of the Report of the Visitors. In reference to the remarks of the Visitors on the Examina- tions in Chemistry and Materia Medica, the Council is of opinion that, for the College of Surgeons to require proofs of "a thorough Jcnoivledge of Chemistry" in its Examinations for Letters Testimonial, would be neither advisable nor, indeed, practicable. Such knowledge could not possibly be obtained by the student during the term which he can devote to the subject. They beg, however, to call the attention of the General Medical Council to the fact, that in their New Scheme of Education, which has now come into force, the subject of Chemistry will be examined upon on two separate occasions, viz., at the termination of the first year, and again at the end of the second, by which means the study of this subject will, the Council think, be suflBciently encouraged, and a competent knowledge of it secured. The Council cannot conclude their observations without ex- pressing their admiration for the care and general accuracy with which the report has been drawn up. S. CHAPLIK, President.

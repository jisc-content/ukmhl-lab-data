Examination. On April 7th the Visitors attended at the Surgeons' Hall at one P.M. to witness the oral examination in anatomy, physiology, and chemistry. There were six examiners. In the room for anatomy, there were four examiners, two of whom examined in anatomy and two in physiology; and in the adjoining room there were two examiners in chemistry. On two tables in the anatomical room there was a collection of bones, and on a third microscopes were arranged with a number of sections already made of bone muscle, cartilage, nerve-tissue, &c. There was a fourth table with dissected sections of the hand, neck, and thorax preserved in spirit, on which the candidates were subse- quently examined. Bach candidate on the completion of his anatomical examination was required to pass into the adjoining room, where he was examined on chemistry for a period of twenty minutes. Candidate No. 1 was examined for twenty minutes on anatomy, and subsequently for the same time on physiology. The examiner not catechising the candidate, took notes of the questions asked on a schedule [See Part III.], on which the various stages of the examination of the candidate were recorded. The candidate was first examined on the femur, on which he was required to point out the attachments of the muscles and ligaments, and to name the various parts about its head and neck. He was also questioned on the arteries supplying the thigh and on the branches of the femoral artery. He was next taken to the table with the dissected specimens, and was required to recognise several superficial muscles and vessels of the neck.

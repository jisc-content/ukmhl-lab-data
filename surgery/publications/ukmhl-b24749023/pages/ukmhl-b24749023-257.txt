KIA'G AND queen's COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS IN lEELAND. 245 examinations reported upon by the Visitors, including the K. Q. Coll. examinations of this College. ' The College wish, in the first place, to consider those matters of general interest, and later on to deal with those specially relatintr to their own examinations. Preface. In the Preface (p. 7) the College notice that the Visitors have not printed the answers at the Wiutten Examinations. The College are of opinion that the Medical Council will be unable to judge of the relative merits of the various examinations unless they have specimens of the answers of "Passed" and "Kejected" candidates before them; as a careful scrutiny of these, with the marks awarded to each answer, is necessary to enable anyone to arrive at a fair estimate of the "Passing" standard of each Corporation. On page 8 of the Preface the College note a remark—" The Visitors have refrained from expressing opinions as to the judg- ment formed by the Examiners in passing or rejecting candidates, feeling that such judgment ought to rest solely with those who are responsible for the examination, and, moreover, that the standard of any examination cannot be fairly taken from the individual judgment of the Examiner, especially when given in the presence of Visitors who have to report critically on the examinations." As the Visitors have refrained from expressing an opinion as to the judgment of the Examiners, it is the more necessary to print specimen answers in conjunction with the questions. Eurther, the College can assure the Council that the presence of the Visitors would have no inflaence in affecting the individual judgment of any of their Examiners. Part I. Regarding the conclusions arrived at by the Visitors, as set out on page 56 of Part I. of the Report, the College beg to express the following opinions :—

52 VISITATION-REPORT. * .System of examiner must be induced to reconsider and revise his own opinion, and to adopt a nomenclature different from what would System of huve spontaneously suggested itself to his mind. When he gested"^^ ^ numerical estimate, on the other hand, it stands for what it is worth in the general judgment, and he has the power of graduating so as to show every possible phase of his own opinion. For example, if he thinks it not quite a " pass," but still so little below the pass that he has almost no desire to influence unfavourably the general result, he can render this opinion in figures at any number from 45 to 50 ; while on the other haiid, if he thinks the case so bad that the candidate ought nnder no circumstances to pass, whatever his excellence in other departments, he can indicate this by numbers from 0 up to 20, 30, or 40. The distinctive character of this system as compared with that of the Royal College of Surgeons in England, which is also numerical in its form, is that in the primary examination of the latter no force or validity whatever is given to the numbers either above or below a certain degree removed from the level pass. So that, for practical purposes, such a numerical system is little, if at all, superior to the simple "pass" or "reject," "yes " or "no," practised in other Boards. SCHEME OF NUMBERS. Scheme of numbers. The following is a scheme graduated so as to afford a scale of examination marks in accordance with the foregoing obser- vations :— 100 90 80^ 70 60 50 Optime. Bene. Level pass. 40 80 20] 10 0 ... Vix satis tene. ... Male. ... Pessime. The working of the above scheme in detail might be as follows, a certain amount of latitude being given according to the tra- ditions of different Boards and the importance attached to the several subjects :— Supposing five separate subjects to be embraced in one examination, viz., A, B, C, D, E—candidates might range thus:—

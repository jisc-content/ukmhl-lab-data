51 PART I.—GENERAL IMPRESSIONS. ciently elastic to adapt itself to the varieties of examination pursued by the different Boards, are such as to make the following remarks, even should they do no more than raise the question, not out of place. It has appeared to the Visitors that the only system of marking which at once indicates with perfect exactness the various shades of difference between " very good " and " very bad," and at the same time enables a satisfactory average to be attained out of a great number of individual judgments, is that of percentages followed out on a perfectly uniform plan through all the separate parts of the examination. Suppose, for example, that an absolute maximum, that is to say, a perfect answer, or a series of answers, is to be estimated at 100, an examiner can generally affirm without difficulty whether in a particular case the answer, or series of answers, amounts to 60, that is to say, what, apart from all other con- siderations, he would consider a "pass." Everything above this, e.g. 60, 70, or 80 per cent., counts for so much above a pass, the higher figures indicating excellence more or less nearly approaching to perfection; while, on the other hand, everything below counts for something short of a pass, and thus it is possible to mark absolute and gross ignorance with a 0, and every degree of demerit in like manner with a number below 50. In the general estimate of results it may be possible, according to the opinion of the Board, to allow a certain amount of deficiency in any one department to be condoned by excellence in another. Or it may be arranged beforehand that a certain amount of deficiency in any one department shall imply rejection, or that the deficiencies in the written paper may be covered by superiority in the oral, or deficiency in medicine, written and oral, by superiority in the clinical, or otherwise as the experience of the Board may direct. The special advantage of this numerical method seems to be that it allows examiners in each subject to represent their opinion of the merits of the candidate with perfect clearness, and at the same time in a form that admits of the opinion of the whole Board being brought to bear to prevent too great stress being laid upon the judgment of a single examiner. So long as the conclusions of the examiners are expressed in terms of " good," "moderate," and "bad," or any corresponding indications of a vague and general nature, it is felt that they may be subject to qualification—that is to say, that an individual D 2

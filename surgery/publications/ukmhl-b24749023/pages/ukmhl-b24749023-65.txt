Considering that the question of the right method of appoint- Appointment ing examiners is of cardinal importance in every examination, of Examiners, the Visitors have placed in a tabular form the information on this point which they have obtained from the various corporations. Without entering into any comparison of those methods which in the case of individual bodies are the result either of long-continued custom, or of the rigid requirements of charter, and therefore unalterable except by Act of Parliament, they feel justified in putting forth certain recommendations, which express the opinions they have formed on the subject in the course of their visitations, viz. :— (a) That the appointment of examiners ought to be in the Eecommenda- hands of a Body responsible to the Corporation for making the best possible selection. (&) That the selection should be made in reference to special fitness to examine in the subjects for which each examiner is i-esponsible. (c) That, with rare exceptions, it is desirable that an examiner should actually be, or should recently have been, a teacher of the subject in which he examines. (cZ) That, as a rule, an examinership should be held by a com- petent examiner for a term of years, with the double object of retaining his experience, and of avoiding too rapid changes in the standard or area of an examination. (e) That examinerships should not be indefinitely renewable, and should not be held by the same individual for a longer period than five years without a break. Com- petent examiners might be re-elected after an interval, say of one or two years,

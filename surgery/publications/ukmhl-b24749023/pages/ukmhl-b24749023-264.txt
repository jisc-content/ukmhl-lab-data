f 252 EEMARKS ON VISITATION-EEPORT. K. Q. CoLi, examination is not shown by the Royal College of Surgeons Phys. Irel. towards the King and Queen's College of Physicians. It is not easy to understand why this should be so, for the standard of examination adopted by the latter college is quite as high as that of the sister corporation. The College cannot agree with the proposal (p. 58), that our Written Examination should be carried out at the several educa- tional centres, in the same manner as in the Oxford and Cam- bridge Local Examinations, &c., among other reasons, because the examinations being held monthly, the number of candidates at each examination is comparatively small, and therefore no delay takes place between the Written and Oral Examinations. Paet III. With regard to Part III. of the Report, the College have only to remark with regret the absence of specimens of the answers given by the candidates to the questions printed with the other examination documents of the College. In conclusion, the College express their gratification at the very favourable tone of the Visitors' Report, and thank the Visitors for the courteous manner in which they have offered certain suggestions for the consideration of the College. Signed on behalf of the College, J. MAGEE FINNY, M.D., June \Oth, 1882. Fellow and Regislrar.

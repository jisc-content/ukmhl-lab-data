apothecaries' society of i-ondon. 277 Botany should be a preliminary subject, and did not include it in Soc. Apoth. their Recommendations for Professional Education and Exami- nation in 1880, this subject has not been such a marked feature in the examination of the Society. V. Marking. This is one of the improvements that the Court of Examiners had actually in contemplation at the time of the Yisit, and the system of marking by percentage was in full working order before the Visitors' Report appeared, in which they recommend that very plan to the various Examining Bodies. In conclusion, tbe Court of Examiners think that they have not been given sufficient credit for the efforts which they have made, and are making, towai-ds the improvement of the exami- nation, in the same manner as was done by former Visitors. The Recommendations of the General Medical Council have always, so far as the Act of Parliament permitted, been promptly attended to, and in some cases anticipated. Such efforts ought to be taken as an earnest of the future, especially having regard to the fact that the Society is not included in the list of those bodies who had not in 1881 attended to the Recommendations of the Visitors of 1873 (page 18), the Examination not having appeared to them to have required special alterations. That on many of the points under discussion there is room for difference of opinion is evidenced by the Report of the former Visitors of 1873. Moreover, the Examination continuing to be conducted in conformity with the recommendations contained in the Report of the Visitors of 1873, and with the Curriculum of the General Medical Council, the Court of Examiners has thought it less desirable to make marked alterations in their method of pro- cedure, believing that the Examination, as existing, is a suflB- cient test for the practice of Medicine.

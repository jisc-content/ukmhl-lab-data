There appears to them, how- ever, a certain inappropriateness in introducing remarks on this point in a Eeport of a Clinical Examination upon the living. In bringing these remarks to a conclusion, the Colleges have no hesitation in saying that they do not consider the recent inspection of Examinations as satisfactory, and that they look upon the Report as ill-fitted to satisfy the expectations of the medical profession. The visitations on former occasions were highly appreciated, and had an undoubted eflFect in raising the standard of Medical Examination, and indirectly of Medical Education. On the present occasion, the Colleges fear that little good will result from the inspections which have taken place. The detailed descriptions of the examinations are on various important subjects, such as midwifery, far too meagre ; the opinions expressed are generally too feebly stated to carry much weight; while the conclusions arrived at, and recommendations proposed, do not seem to be of such importance as to justify such an elaborate and expensive inquiry. The Colleges think that it was a mistake to commit the visitation of the examinations of so many important Bodies to three gentlemen only, who, however well qualified, could not possibly, if engaged in practice, devote to it such an amount of time and care as the Medical Council and the Profession had a right to expect.

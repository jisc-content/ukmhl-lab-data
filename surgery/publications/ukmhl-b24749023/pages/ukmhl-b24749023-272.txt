The Visitors Beem to have a very exaggerated idea Edin. diflSculty of judging the merits of written papers, and of the time required for doing so. No such difficulties are experi- enced by the Examiners of the Colleges, for it is to be borne in mind that the examination is not a competitive one, but merely a test as to whether the candidate is to be admitted to the oral examination or not, and in doubtful cases it is usual at this stage to give the candidate the benefit of any reasonable doubt.

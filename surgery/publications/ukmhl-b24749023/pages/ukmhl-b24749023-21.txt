9 PAET I GENERAL IMPRESSIONS. Before entering upon any criticism of tlie particular Ex- amining Bodies, the Visitors wish to record the general im- pressions they have received of the examinations which they have inspected. In every examination they found some features specially worthy of commendation, and a large amount of good work done by earnest and competent men. It may be doubted whether, up to a certain point, the differences between the ex- aminations are not, in reality, an advantage; because, while some Examining Bodies insist more strongly on one thing, and some on another, it would seem that, were each of the exami- nations severally developed to their highest standard in every subject, the demand upon the candidate could not be met. One Body devotes itself more to developing one aspect of the examination, another to another, and thus a high standard, with regard to particular subjects, is preserved, which otherwise would be unattainable. It might be argued that, for the average student, it is more important to have a moderately high standard all round than to have excellence in particular depart- ments, with a comparatively low standard in others. But, looking to the exceedingly wide range, and the great multiplicity of subjects for examination in a medical curriculum, and also to the time at the disposal of the student, only a very moderate standard all round can possibly be attained by the majority. Whether the area of examination ought not to be limited so as to permit of a high standard in essential subjects being required is an important question, especially as education becomes daily more and more the slave of examination. Hence it is once more a serious subject for inquiry, whether a careful limitation of some of the fundamental studies, such as physiology and Geneeal Impressions. Special features in every Examina- tion. Limitation of certain studies recommended.

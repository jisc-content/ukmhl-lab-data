56 I* VISITATION-HE PORT. CONCLUSIONS. Conclusions. As the result of the visitations of the nine Corporations, the Visitors beg to append the following conclusions as to points which they think are desirable in the conduct of medical exami- nations. 1. That every "primary" or "first part" examination should include dissections by every candidate. 2. That, having regard to the great and increasing range of chemical and physiological scieace, candidates should be apprised beforehand of the limits of the examination in these subjects. 3. That at the final examination, candidates should be examined orally or practically on strictly regional anatomy, that is, on the parts of anatomy which illustrate surgery and medical diagnosis, and not on purely descriptive anatomy. 4. That in every final examination for a surgical diploma, candidates should be required to perform operations on the dead subject. 5. That for every "minimum" qualification the examination in operative surgery should be confined to emergency operations, such as any practitioner may suddenly be called upon to perform, e.g., amputation, deligation of arteries, catheterism, urethrotomy, tracheotomy, &c., and should for the most part exclude com- plicated operations, not of sudden urgency, such as ovariotomy, excisions of joints, plastic operations, lithotomy, lithotrity. 6. That the application of bandages and splints should be required in every surgical clinical examination. 7. That the examination of normal and morbid urine should be an essential part of every clinical examination in medicine. 8. That the practical examinations in chemistry should, when feasible, be conducted in a laboratory. 9. That a practical knowledge of the histology of tissues and chief organs should be required of all candidates for medical or surgical diplomas.

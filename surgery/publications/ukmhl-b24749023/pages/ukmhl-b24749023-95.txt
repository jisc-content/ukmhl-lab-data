One of the examiners (Dr. Frazer) superintended the admis- Final sion of candidates and the working of the examination.

The candidates were called in by Dr. Frazer, begin- ning with the first number balloted for, No. 50. The candidate who had drawn No. 50 appeared and was given another card marked " 50," with the name of a major operation which he had to perform.

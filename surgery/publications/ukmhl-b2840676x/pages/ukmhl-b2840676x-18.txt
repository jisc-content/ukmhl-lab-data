10 prostate gland, terminates with it. The second division is called membranous, and extending from the prostate, runs immediately under the symphisis pubis, and is terminated at the anterior part by the bulb. The latter is therefore situated a little below the anterior part of the sym- phisis pubis. The third division, or spongy part, comprehends the remaining portion, which extends, from thebulb, to the extremity of the glans penis. By this division, the seat of the disease can be more accurately described and under- stood. In examining the canal, we find, in the natural state, three parts of it more dilated than the rest; one of these is situated at the prostate gland, the se- cond in the bulb, and the third about the beginning of the glans. With these di- latations, it also possesses the same num- ber of slight contractions; the first is at its origin from the bladder; the second, at the membranous part; and the third, at the point of the glans. This sub- ject, of the diameter of the urethra, has been very accurately elucidated by Mr.

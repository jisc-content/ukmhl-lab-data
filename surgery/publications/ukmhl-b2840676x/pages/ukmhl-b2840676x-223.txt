Mr. P , aged 45, applied to me in August 1808, fora fistula of two years standing. He attributed its origin to frequent hard riding on horseback. A French surgeon, under whose care he was, previously to my seeing him, had promised to cure the complaint by means of injection. After a trial however of four months, he found himself worse, the pain and discharge having much in- creased.

Under these circumstances, I employed a stimulating injection, which occasioned much irrita- tion, but succeeded in accomplishing a cure, in the course of six weeks.

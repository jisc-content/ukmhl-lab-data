63 The next circumstance that claims attention, is its use. For the rea- sons I have stated above, it has been my uniform practice, in all strictures, to begin with a bougie of a moderate size, or one so large as to make a suf- ficient impression upon the urethra to a certain extent. To judge of the pro- priety of this plan, we have only to con- sider the causes of stricture, or the change of organization which takes place in the passage, and occasions the disease. The most frequent cause of this af- fection, I have already stated to be a previous attack of gonorrhoeal, or other inflammation, which, when it produces great excitement in the urethra, occa- sions an effusion of coagulable lymph, which is deposited in the cellular mem- brane, in the manner stated in Chap. II. But this substance does not become so firmly organized as other parts of the living solid ; hence it yields more readily to pressure, ''and consequently is more easily acted upon by the absorbent vessels.

I have found it useful, in the first stage of the cure, after having got through the stricture, occasionally to introduce in the evening a catgut bougie, which is to remain in the passage some part of the night. From its structure, the heat and moisture of the part causes it to swell, thus gaining considerably in the progress of the cure, and requiring the other bougie to be less frequently employed.

That the dilatation should not, at any time, be carried further than the feelings of the patient will allow.

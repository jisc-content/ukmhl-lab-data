ยง4 For two years before, on making water, lie found it necessary to use much strain- ing, especially after riding on horseback: this, at length, became so violent, that he could hardly void his urine at all, af- ter using any exercise, except in divided streams, (generally two,) or in a very small stream. On his applying to me, I passed down a moderate sized bougie, and found a stricture about the bulb of the urethra, which I could not penetrate. I then tried a smaller one, and that also failed. This did not excite much irri- tation, and, therefore, the next day, I again passed the middle sized one, and kept it pressing on the stricture for about five minutes. It then gave him some degree of uneasiness, and I was obliged to withdraw it, in consequence of a vio- lent inclination he felt to make water. The next day, I passed it again ; and after keeping it in the passage about ten minutes, it suddenly penetrated about an inch through the stricture, and was fol- lowed by some discharge of blood; but I could not get it beyond this part.

200 the first point it may be observed, that a complete division of the sphincter muscle is necessary, even where the intestine is simply denuded; for without this no dependence can be placed on the cure, as each time that the patient goes to stool, the edges of the sinuses, from the action of the sphincter, will be pulled asunder, from which the same state will arise as that for which the operation was performed. A want of attention to this circumstance may be considered as the common cause of fail- ure in this operation,* and which the experience of every surgeon will confirm. 2. The operation is never to be consi- dered as complete, unless all the sinuses are carefully divided and laid into one. Where this is omitted, the other steps of the operation may be performed in the most judicious manner, and yet prove unsuccessful ; a want of healing still continuing in some of the sinuses, * Some operators have been fearful of dividing the sphincter, from an idea of destroying the power of retaining the fceces.

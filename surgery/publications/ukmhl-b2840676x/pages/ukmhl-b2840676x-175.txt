165 will be found universally dry, attended with a desquamation of the cuticle in various parts of the body, especially after exposure to cold. The eyelids are ex- coriated, and even frequently ulcerated. The scalp, partaking of the constitu- tional affection, assumes the appearances already described ; some part of it from the means employed may begin to mend, but in another, hitherto uncontaminated, the disease will occur, or a discharge may take place, from behind the ears. When the sores produced in other parts of the body by the contact of the mat- ter get better, the head becomes worse, and vice versa. Under such constitu- tional circumstances of Tinea, it is. evi- dent, that we may as well attempt to heal a true scorbutic ulcer by topical applications, without attending to the morbid state of the animal economy. We must not, therefore, expect that Tinea, which exists in consequence of a morbid change in the system, should be cured by mere topical means.

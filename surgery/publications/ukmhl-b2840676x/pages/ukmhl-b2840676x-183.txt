173 attending to the constitutional symp- toms, and instead of administering tonics in any form, my chief object is to attend to the state of the alimentary canal and skin. With this view I have found calo- mel, united with tartar emetic (as an alte- rative), given every night at bed-time, of service ; and also a full dose of calomel, scammony, and jalap, administered two or three times in the week, so as to excite brisk purging, equally necessary ; as well as putting the child occasionally into the warm bath, or warm sea-bath can it be procured. With this treatment may be conjoined frictions to the abdo- men, and when sufficient attention has been paid to the system, in order to re- store it as nearly as possible to the stand- ard of health, I then attend to the local complaint, employing the same applica- tions as in the other forms of the dis- ease, varying them according to circum- stances.

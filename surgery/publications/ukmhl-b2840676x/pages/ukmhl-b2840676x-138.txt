Leeches were applied to the perinaeum, and small doses of the pulv. dover. given at night. The relief obtained by this plan was both speedy and great, as he made water easily, though it deposited a thick sediment. From this circumstance, conceiving that the irritation had much affected the mucous coat of the bladder, I had re- course to the uva ursi, with a strong so- lution of gum arabic; which I consi- der almost a specific remedy against this symptom. By this plan, the bladder gradually regained its functions, the urine was propelled in the usual forcible manner, and the cure completed in the space of three weeks, without passing a bougie. >

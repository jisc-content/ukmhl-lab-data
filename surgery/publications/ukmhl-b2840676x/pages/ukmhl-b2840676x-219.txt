Mr. V aged 40, applied to me in May 1808, for the cure of a fistula in ano, from which he had suffered during the last five years. He was anxious to submit to the operation, the pain and discharge of matter having, for some time previous, much increased. Exces- sive drinking and other irregularities, concurred with the local complaints to induce a state approaching to hectic. I dissuaded him from having the opera- tion performed till his health was in some degree re-established. With this view I sent him to the sea-side, where he remained two months, employing constitutional remedies, together with the sea-bath and salt-water poultice. Â¥

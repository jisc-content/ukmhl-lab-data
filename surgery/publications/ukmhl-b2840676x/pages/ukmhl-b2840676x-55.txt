47 pily, however, these cases are but few, and only form exceptions to a general rule. Where they arise, Mr. Homeâ€™s method is certainly preferable to all others, as his instrument is improved, as far as possible, for the precise local ap- plication. The caustic he employs, is of a firm concentrated nature, with but little tendency to diffuse itself. Conceiving that the injurious effects of caustic, arise from the nature of the matter used, rather than the principle of the cure, Mr. Whately imagined that he had made considerable improve- ment in the treatment of stricture, by substituting the kali purum for the lunar caustic.

The urethra is a membranous canal, the extent of which from the orifice to the neck of the bladder has been esti- mated, according to the most accurate measurements taken by anatomists, to be between eight and nine inches, The surface of this canal, is the part which is the seat of the disease; and accordingly requires the careful attention of the sur- geon. It is a continuation of the mu- cous membrane of the bladder, and fur- nishes a copious secreting surface, liable to constant irritation from the office it is destined to perform; it may be con- sidered as a glandular apparatus, pouiv itig out, by means of its excretory ducts, a secretion, mucilaginous in its nature, intended for a certain purpose in the animal economy.

Hence they assert, that where a bougie of the smallest size cannot be passed, an opening may be procured by a small steel or silver wire, which, on entering the stricture, will allow the bougie to follow. To this practice however there are various objec- tions. Too small a bougie seldom fails to irritate the urethra, and to produce spasm ; thus adding a new disease to the original affection, and rendering the obstacles to the cure more numerous. Besides, a small bougie, in the progress of its passage, must necessarily wound, as its point will entangle itself, as it proceeds, in some of the small openings or lacunae, with which the interior sur- face of the urethra is every where lined, and whose orifices point towards the glans penis. Besides which, such a bougie cannot give a degree of pressure sufficient to have any material influence on the obstructing cause.

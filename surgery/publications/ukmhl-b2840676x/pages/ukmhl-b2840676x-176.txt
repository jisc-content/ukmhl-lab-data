I The nature of the constitutional affec- tion, deduced from the cases which have occurred to me, is as follows. Digestionis impaired; the aliment passes into the intestines in an imassimilated state ; the chyle thence produced is deficient in quantity, and defective in quality ; and its absorption (even were it healthy) would be greatly impeded by the quan- tity of mucus lining the internal surface of the alimentary canal. The muscular fibres of the intestines are weak, a great quantity of flatus is generated, which distends them, producing a degree of tympanitis. The liver, under these cir- cumstances, endeavours to make up for the morbid changes in the other secre- tions, and therefore prepares bile of a much more acrid quality than in a state of health. This state of the bile, seems essential to the activity of the intestines, and though we cannot prove it by any fact, there can be little doubt, that there is also a change in the quality of the pan- creatic juice. We'cannot therefore be

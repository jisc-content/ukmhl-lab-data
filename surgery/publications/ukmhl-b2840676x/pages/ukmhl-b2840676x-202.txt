/ W2 % persons is less than natural; the conse- quence of which must be, that the ves- sels of the intestines, whether arteries or veins, will become more loaded with blood. The blood-vessels themselves are also of a mÂ«re relaxed structure ; hence they dilate considerably, and thus the circulation is rendered extremely lan- guid, particularly in veins, where the blood acts against its own gravity. The consequence of this is, that the blood from the rectum, and its neighbour- hood, is impeded in its return to the heart. The congestion thus produced, will occasion the surrounding cellular i 0 membrane to become laden with fluid, produced from the exhalent terminations of the arteries; while the veins, from their increased size, occasioning a me- chanical pressure and irritation, will, as they enlarge, break down the cells of this membrane, and excite in it an erisypela- tous inflammation ; the matter then fre- quently points externally in the form of a tumour, or it is discharged with the stools.

In the course of two months more, the symptoms were so much increased, that he became unable to pass his urine with- out the greatest labour, and much pain, so that he was nearly a quarter of an hour in emptying his bladder. In this state, after opening his bowels, and after putting him into the warm bath, I pass- ed a bougie of a moderate size. Finding very little sensibility in the canal, I kept it there for the space of ten mi- nutes, making pressure on the obstruc- tion. I, next day, increased my pres- sure to a quarter of an hour; and on the following one, for twenty minutes ; and for the space of half an hour, on three successive days. But gainino- no ground by this mode, and the urethra being very insensible, I endeavoured to pass a gum elastic bougie, to find the â€¢ opening of the stricture; but, making no progress with this instrument, I next day introduced the caustic, and kept it for two minutes at the strictured part.

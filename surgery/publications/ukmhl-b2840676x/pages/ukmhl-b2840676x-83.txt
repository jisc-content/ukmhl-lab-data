We should be particularly careful, that the caustic be well guarded on its sides, so as to be exactly in the centre of the extremity of the instrument; and, when introduced, it should not be instantaneously with- drawn, as is commonly done, but retained at the strictured part for a moderate length of time, which must be regulated by the feelings of the patient.* If only a very slight application is made at each introduction, it will not tend to destroy, but merely to stimulate the stricture; fresh inflammation will thereby be ex- * N.B.

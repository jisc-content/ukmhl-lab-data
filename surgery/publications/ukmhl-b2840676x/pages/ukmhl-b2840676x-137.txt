m -any plan of treatment, without having fully ascertained the cause of the affec- tion. In this instance, no stricture whatever had existed ; the patient had repeatedly submitted to a painful and dangerous.operation,to remove a morbid state which did not exist; and in conse- quence of the applications which were made, his general health had considerably suffered, his mind was harassed by the idea of the danger of his situation, and the urethra and bladder rendered so irri- table, as to keep him in a very painful and disagreeable state. Conceiving the general health, and morbid state of the urethra and bladder, to be the chief points requiring my attention, I im- mediately opened his bowels by small doses of rhubarb and calomel, joined to the magnes. vitriol, with a solution of emetic tartar; a combination whose beneficial effects have never disap- pointed my expectations, where a mild effect was required to be produced on the bowels, joined with a tendency to an increased discharge by the skin.

66 minutes, or half an hour, (which is the usual time for each application ofthe bou- gie) I seldom continue it longer than a minute or two, at each successive intro- duction. Having once passed a bougie, in this slow and cautious manner, through the stricture, I seldom consider this instrument any longer necessary. I find the case more easily and successfully conducted to a termination, by means of the catheter, or sound, which I ac- cordingly substitute, as soon as circum- stances admit. The progress- of this plan will be better understood by the de- tail of cases subjoined to these observa- tions, than by any rules which can be laid down. But, both the success and quickness of cure, I attribute, in every instance, to the largeness of the bougie at first employed. By a large size, the stricture becomes dilated to a greater* extent, and pressure is also made on the surrounding parts.

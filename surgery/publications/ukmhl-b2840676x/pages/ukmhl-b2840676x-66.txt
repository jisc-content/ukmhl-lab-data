It pos- sesses all the advantages, in point of smoothness of surface, and capability of pressure, that attend the metallic one, without any of its inconveniences ; and if the materials, of which it is formed, be thoroughly intermixed, no part will be left in the urethra to excite irrita- tion. This is an objection which has been insisted on by those who are par- tial to the metallic bougie ; but it can happen only when it is badly made, and attention is not paid to the fineness of the articles, which enter into its composition. * Those made by Mr. Guthery, of Lower James* street, are as good as any.

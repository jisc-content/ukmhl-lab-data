184 I CASE X. William Ritchie, five years of age, of a scrophulous habit, became a patient of the Eastern Dispensary under my care, in May last, for Tinea. The com-? plaint had been coming on for five months before, and was caught at a school where numerous children were infected with it, and in whom it had been allowed to proceed unmolested. The head was first shaved, and the oint- ment formula, No. 5, well rubbed into the part every morning by means of a brush. â€¢ The child was occasionally purged by doses of calomel and rhubarb, and a determination to the skin main- tained by antirnonials. After a time, tonics were exhibited, as the tinct. ferr. sleeping together ; one aged eight years, in whom the complaint had been coming on three months ; and the'other live years of age, where it had existed about the same time; both of whom got completely well.

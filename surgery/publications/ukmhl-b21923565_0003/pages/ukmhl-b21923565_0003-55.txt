LIGATURE OF ILIAC ARTERIES. 679 operating for ligature of the vessel, because at its lower part it is always found on the pubis ; so that, by tracing it from that point upwards, or from its bifurcation downwards, its position in any case can be readily ascertained. But it is well to recollect how easily it is displaced, in relation to diagnosis of iliac aneurism, and in deciding whether the external or common iliac artery should be tied, for in some cases of aneurism low down on the external iliac, the tumour displaces the upper part of the artery, curving it on itself, and thus might mislead us as to the ^ extent of healthy artery between the aneurism and the common iliac. Operation.â€”From the anatomical disposition of the parts as described, it results, that to expose and tie any of the iliac arteries, the skin, superficial fascia, the aponeurosis of the ex- ternal oblique and the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, together with the transversalis fascia, must be divided, whilst the peritoneum must be carefully separated from the iliac fossa, and pushed aside. In performing the operation, the patient should be laid upon his back, the pelvis a little inclined towards the healthy side, so that the floating intestines may fall into the pelvis and cause less projection of the peritoneum into the wound. The operator, having ascertained the position of the spine of the pubis, com- mences his incision about two inches external to that point, and about eight lines above the crural arch, and carries it obliquely upwards through the skin and superficial fascia for about three or four inches, so that it shall terminate above, about ten lines internal to the anterior superior spinous process. It is evident that by this line of incision we cannot come directly upon the artery, b\it then we weaken the abdominal parietes less than by any other line of incision, and we reach a part where we can most readily push aside the peritoneum without risk. Any branches of arteries or veins which bleed should be tied, and then the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle divided to the same extent as the incision of the integuments. The fibres of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles are next carefully

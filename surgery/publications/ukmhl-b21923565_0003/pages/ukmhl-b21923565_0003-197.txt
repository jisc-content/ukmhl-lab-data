AMPUTATION AT SHOULDER-JOINT. 801 of the knife close to the bone, as in excision, the trunk of the posterior circumflex is protected. The only vessel which bleeds is the anterior circumflex divided in the first incision, and, if necessary, a pair of catch forceps can be placed on it at once. In regard to the axillary vessels, they can either be compressed by an assistant before completing the division of the soft part on the axillary aspect; or, to avoid all risk, the axillary artery may be exposed, tied, and divided between two ligatures, so as to allow it to retract before dividing the other textures. In cases where the limb is very muscular, I dissect the skin and fat from the deltoid at the lower part, and then divide the muscular fibres higher up by a second incision, so as to avoid redundancy of muscular tissue. After arresting bleeding, I bring the edges together with a few points of suture, leaving an open- ing at the lower and back part, through which the ligatures are brought out and the free escape of blood and other discharge permitted. The dressing I use is very simple, being merely a flat pad of lint secured by a six-tailed split cloth, the tails being tied on the opposite side of the body. The advantages I claim for this plan areâ€”1st. The fulness and better form of the stump left after the healing, as shown in the results (Fig. 2). 2d. The posterior circumflex artery is not divided except in its small terminal branches in front ; whereas, both in the large del- toid flap and the double-flap methods, the trunk of the vessel is divided in the early steps I'ig. 2. of the operation, and, retracting, often gives rise to em- barrassing haemorrhage. In the case of the deltoid single- flap method;- the vitality of the flap must be seriously compro-

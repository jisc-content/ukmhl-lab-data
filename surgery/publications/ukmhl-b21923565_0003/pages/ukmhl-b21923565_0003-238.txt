836 AMPUTATION. yond the bone affected, yet in the ease of the femur, the dread of the immediate risks of amputation at the hip-joint has led prac- tically to the abandonment of the principle, and amputation through or near the trochanters, in cases of malignant tumour, is often advised, and resorted to, as being safer than disarticula- tion, unless the growth is so high up as nearly to involve the trochanter. I think this a very serious error, as I believe, in such tumours, the disease permeates the whole of the medullary and cancellated texture of the femur, and that there is no security for the removal of the disease except in removal of the entire bone, by disarticulation ; and from what I have seen of high amputa- tions in the thigh, for malignant tumours, I believe the risks of amputation through or near the trochanters to be as great, if not greater, than those of amputation at the joint. In the latter, the rapidity of performance is greater, the loss of blood less ; whilst the risks of pyaemia are certainly less in cases of disarticulation than in amputation through the continuity of a bone, where we have the chances of myelitis, inflammation of the veins of the medullary Haversian canals, and acute necrosis, which are especi- ally liable to occur in the state of the system accompanying malignant disease. Besides the interest which attaches to a successful case of amputation at the hip-joint, that just recorded possesses interest in regard to the diagnosis of the disease, and the condition and treatment of the patient after the operation. The general history of the disease from its commencement; the obscure wandering pains referred to the thigh long before any alteration in the limb was detected, and then the appearance of a small but distinct lateral swelling as described by her mother, together with the subsequent rapid growth and increased pain, were all very characteristic of malignant disease of the femur. On the other hand, however, there was not the slightest appear- ance of the peculiar cachectic state which so generally accom- panies malignant growths ; the child was of ruddy complexion and plump, her appetite good, and all the functions natural, though she was restless and somewhat irritable at night.

886 INJURIES OF HEAD. performed late, yet these are rare exceptions, and should not weigh with us as a reason for delay. The operation of trephining should be done at once, and all fragments of bone carefully removed; and when that is done the patients generally make good recoveries, and require little more than cold-water dressings to the wound, low diet, and attention to keep the bowels freely open, and, of course, absolute rest and quiet. Fractures of the base of the cranium are the cases in which there is the greatest amount of compression and of danger, for, besides the extensive breaking up of the bone and pro- jection of small fragments of it into the most important parts of the brain, there is a great risk of the vessels at the base of the brain being injured. Many, in fact, consider these fractures as fatal in all cases. The general symptoms of such a fracture are those of compres- sion with bleeding from the nose, mouth, and ear. When there is bleeding from the nostrils, the ethmoid bone is generally broken, and the anterior part of the base of the skull split up. A blow upon the nose with the fist may even cause fracture of the base of the skull, by break- ing up the ethmoid, nasal, and turbinated bones. In some cases of fracture of the base of the skuU, the bleeding takes place from the ear only, and not from the nose or mouth. It must, however, be remem- bered, that bleedings from the nose, mouth, or ears, are not absolute diagnostics of this injury, as they may arise from rupture of the lining mem- branes of these parts in com- paratively slight injuries. The force required to cause this injury is very considerable. In some cases there may be a de-

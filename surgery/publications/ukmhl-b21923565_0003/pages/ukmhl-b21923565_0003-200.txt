LECTURE LXXXIX. Special Amputations continued— Lower Extremity—Amputation of the Phalanges of the Toes : of the Phalanges of the great Toe with or without its Meta- tarsal Bone—Partial Amputations of the Foot; of all the Toes : Hey's Operation ; Chopart's Operation—Amputation at the Ankle : by Syme's Method ; by a large Intei'nal Flap—Other Modifications. The amputations of the lower extremity are performed on tlie same principles as those of the upper, but require to be modified in respect of form, and uses of the part left. The dotted lines on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot in Figures 1 and 2, Plate xxxix., indicate the lines of incision gene- rally adopted in amputation of the toes, and partial amputations of the foot. Amputation of the Phalanges of the Toes may be neces- sitated by a variety of causes, such as injury, cario-necrosis, exostosis, onychia maligna ; or by the toe having become so dis- torted as to interfere with progression. In the last-mentioned coirdition I have frequently saved the toe by dividing the flexor or extensor tendons, and other resistant tissues, so as to straighten the toe ; but the after-treatment of such operations is often tedious and troublesome, so that amputation affords a more rapid cure and equally good result, so far as the use of .the foot is concerned. Amputation of the Toe is, or should be, always performed at the junction of the phalanges with the metatarsal bone. The lines of incision, and the mode of procedure, are the same as in the corresponding amputation of the finger ; only we must recol- lect that the joint lies further removed from the web between the toes than the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the fingers. The amputation is accomplished thus :—The point of the bistoury is

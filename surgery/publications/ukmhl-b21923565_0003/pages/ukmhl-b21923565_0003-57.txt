681 LIGATURE OF ILIAC ARTERIES. the wound, and kept in position by broad strips of adhesive plaster, so as to support the abdominal wall in the vicinity of the incision. When removed to bed, the patient should be placed on the sound side, to remove, as far as possible, all pres- sure from the weakened part, and an opiate given to procure rest and diminish the peristaltic movements of the intestines. The operative procedure for reaching either the internal or common iliac arteries, is, up to a certain point, precisely similar to that just described ; but when the surgeon has to some extent separated the peritoneum from the iliac fossa, he continues to separate it further up from the interior of the transversalis muscle and fascia, pushing it gently inwards, and then, with a probe- pointed bistoury introduced flat on his finger, he turns the edge upwards and extends the incision to the degree required to en- able him to reach the vessel which he wishes to tie. He must, however, remember that the closer attachment of the parietal peritoneum, and the greater bulging of that membrane high up in the abdomen, render it more liable to injury, and he must also keep in mind his proximity to the ureter and spermatic vessels. The method of tying the external iliac by a nearly transverse incision, about six or eight lines above Poupart's ligament, as practised by Sir Astley Cooper, enables the surgeon to reach the vessel easily enough at its lower part in the case of a femoral aneurism which does not bulge upwards. But the vessel is ex- posed too near its collateral branches, the epigastric and circum- flex ilii, and the spermatic cord is in greater danger. The principal objection, however, is, that we cannot tie the vessel higher up, should that be found necessary, without having re- course to a new line of incision such as that which I have de- scribed, so that the oblique ascending incision, Abernethy's method as it is sometimes termed, is that generally, and I think deservedly, preferred. The arterial anastomoses which maintain and ultimately re- establish the circulation beyond the point of deligation in the case of ligature of the external iliac artery, are very numerous,

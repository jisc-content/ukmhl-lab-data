INJURIES OF HEAD. 900 plan of dressing the wound I recommended when speaking of the prevention of fungus cerebri, should be employed at first, and indeed in most cases throughout the cure. The general after-treatment may be stated as antiphlogistic. Opium or other anodynes may be given to procure rest. At one time opium was considered as improper in head injuries, but if judiciously given, and its effects watched, it is often very beneficial. Ice to the head at first is of great use, both for modifying the circulation and as a sedative. In some, however, its effects are too depressing, and hence its action must be watched. In cases where we operate to evacuate purulent matter, the treatment must be modified in many cases. Nutrient diet and quinine, and even wine are often necessary, and instead of doing harm prove of the greatest benefit. In fine, the state of the individual patient must regulate our practice. I have already stated, when speaking of the various injuries of the head, the circumstances which may require the surgeon to perform the operation of trephine, and the principles on which he acts in each case. But here, as in some other cases where emergency demands promptitude in action, I think it advisable, before leaving this important subject, to state succinctly, in a dogmatic form, the cases in which I would advise trepan to be performed :â€” 1st. Without delay, in all cases of distinct punctured fracture, to avert mischief by removing the fragments of the inner table. 2d. In cases of compound comminuted fracture, with de- pression (not in mere fissure, with wounded scalp). 2>d. In simple depressed fracture, when, after a fair trial of other measures, the urgent symptoms of compression are persistent. Aih. In compression from extravasated blood, when the posi- tion of the injury or the existence of a fissured fracture indicate the probability of a large artery, such as the middle meningeal, having been torn. a

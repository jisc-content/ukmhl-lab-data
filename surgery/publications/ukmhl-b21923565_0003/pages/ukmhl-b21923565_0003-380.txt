Unfortunately an ulcer of a cancerous nature, Epithelioma of THE Tongue (Fig. 25), is too frequently met with, and presents ^ff^^p':,^^-^^ the usual history and character of that and elsewhere : it is simply a manifestation of the cancerous diathesis. The disease is quite as much constitutional as any other form of cancer, and the structure affected merely modifies its local character. The expediency of removing the tongue for cancer will depend on the extent of the disease.

If the disease occupies a small por- tion of the tongue only, the best method is simply to remove it by an incision wide of the part, arresting the bleeding by torsion, or by applying the cautery to the surface. Where the tip or upper portion of the tongue is affected, a V-shaped portion may be removed, and the parts brought together after the bleeding- is arrested. This enables the patient to retain the power ol speech. Or we may strangulate the anterior half of the tongue, and cut olf the cancerous mass in front of the ligatures, or the form of cancer.

OPERA TIONS. 778 that amongst the fatal cases of excision of the knee-joiut 2 were of this kind, and I believe that the unfavourable result in such cases is due to the unhealthy state of constitution in which idiopathic necrosis occurs, aggravated by the debilitating in- fluences present during the prolonged process of the disease, the repeated formation of deep-seated abscesses, and the dis- charge prior to, and even after, the sequestra have been thrown off or removed. In such circumstances, when disease of the joint supervenes either immediately in connection with the necrosis, or manifests itself as distinct disease some time after the necrosis has been cured, it seems to me, we have to deal with a state of constitution very specially predisposed to pyaemia or other form of blood-poisoning. In the rarer cases, where amputation had to be performed for chronic necrosis of the shaft of the femur, the same conditions seem to have led to simi- lar results. Of 6 such amputations, 4 recovered and 2 died. As regards amputation in acute necrosis of the femur and humerus, whether the diseased action arise idiopathically or from injury, the results are so disastrous that for many years I have refrained from operating, as I believe the patient has a better chance for life by trusting to nature and careful treat- ment than by having the diseased limb removed. I know that it is very trying to witness the sufferings of young patients when labouring under the irritative fever accompanying acute necrosis, when it seems as if it were impossible for the constitution to bear up against the exhausting process, and when removal of the affected mass by amputation seems so ready and simple a re- source. Doubtless the condition of the patient is very danger- ous ; but I repeat, from experience and observation of a large number of such cases, that the patient has a better chance without the operation ; for we must remember what we are very apt to forget, when looking only at one view of the case, the un- favourable conditions which are likely to supervene after an operation performed in such a state, and when there is such a risk of blood-poisoning. After a time, when the irritative fever has passed into hectic, and the discharges become more dis-

OPERA TIONS. 780 with those of cases of a similar character where the amputation was performed beyond the bone affected, I think it will appear that not only do we give the patient a better chance of subsequent immunity from return of the disease, but that we diminish the immediate risk to life by performing what at first sight may appear a more serious operation : Thusâ€”of 4 cases of ampu- tation at the shoulder-joint for malignant tumour of the arm, 3 recovered and 1 died ; of 3 amputations at the lower third of the thigh for malignant tumour of the tibia, all recovered; and of 3 cases of amputation at the hip-joint, 2 recovered and 1 died. The fatal case of amputation at the shoulder was that of a boy whose friends had declined to permit amputation two years previously, and who as strenuously urged its perform- ance when the tumour had involved the soft parts, and when re- peated haemorrhage had so exhausted him that I performed the operation only under protest. In regard to the hip-joint, the two successful cases were examples of malignant tumour de- veloped in the femur, and they both made excellent recoveries, although they were much exhausted at the time of the operation. The unsuccessful case was one of cancerous tumour of the soft parts. The patient had declined interference eighteen months previously, and the tumour had increased greatly, with marked cachexy, at the time of the operation. If, therefore, we exclude these two cases, and confine our ob- servation to malignant tumours limited to the bone, all the cases of that kind in which amputation was performed beyond the affected bone recovered, whilst in those where amputation was performed through the continuity of the affected bone, 6 out of 11 died. Amputation at the hip I believe is really attended with as little if not less risk in its performance than even am- putation through the trochanters ; and, whilst it affords the best chance for complete removal of the disease, it is also attended in most cases with a better chance of recovery from the operation. At the same time, when the tumour is limited to the condyle of the femur, I think that in the early stage amputation above the middle of the thigh is sufficiently safe, as in none of the four

LECTUEE LXXVII. Surgical Anatomy of the Iliac Arteries—Steps of tlie Oijeration for tying them —Modes in ■which the Circulation is subsequently re-established—Direct Ligature of the Iliac Arteries for Aneurism. The abdominal aorta, on reaching tlie lower part of the lumbar vertebrae, divides into its terminal branches, the two common iliac arteries, and its more direct continuation, the small artery known as the middle sacral. Its two great lateral branches, the common iliac arteries, descend obliquely outwards and somewhat forwards, diverging until they arrive in front of the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, at which point each common iliac again subdi- vides into the internal iliac or hypogastric artery and the external iliac. The internal iliac artery passes abruptly downwards from the point of division in front of the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, and, on arriving at the level of the ischiatic notch, subdivides into numerous branches to the varioxxs pelvic viscera, and others which pass through the obturator foramen and ischiatic notch to be distributed outside the pelvis. The external iliac artery, from its place of origin, passes downwards and slightly outwards until it reaches a point nearly midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the body of the pubis corresponding to the ilio-pectineal eminence ; it then passes beneath Poupart's ligament, and receives the name of common femoral. The rela- tions of the arteries whose general course I have indicated may be stated as follows :—Each common iliac is about 2-^ inches long, and, in its descent, rests on the lateral aspect of the bodies of the inferior lumbar vertebrte, and is somewhat in relation laterally to the inner part of the psoas muscle, to which it approaches more closely at its bifurcation. On the right side the common

LECTURE LXXXVL Amputation continued—Causes of Mortality—Statistics—Cii'cumstances modify- ing the Value of the Information derived from them—Tahle exhibiting the Results of Author's Practice—Comments on and Deductions made from them. The consideration of tlie causes of the mortality after ampu- tation is a subject so wide, that I cannot be expected to enter on it in all its phases fully in a course of lectures such as this, where so many subjects demand our attention. I will, therefore, con- fine myself to treating of it from certain points of view, which, from my own experience, I believe to have practical bearings. Of late years much has been written on this subject, and large statistics have been published, from which certain general deduc- tions may be drawn;—the most usual deduction being that amputations of the limbs are very dangerous operations, and those of the lower extremity specially fatal. Now, for my own part, I cannot see any great benefit to be de- rived from this kind of information, unless it be intended to indi- cate the propriety of abandoning the operation. However desirable it may be to possess the data established by such statistics, I think it might have been predicted, that in such an operation as am- putation, an operation of last resort, and performed often under most unfavourable circumstances, the mortality would be great; and yet I should think such considerations would not deter any man of sense and experience from performing an operation which gives the only reasonable chance for life. But what I do consider to be of practical importance is to ascertain how far the operation in itself is necessarily of great danger, or whether the dangers are greatly due to circumstances under which it is performed. It is quite possible that the statistics of an operation not dangerous in itself may show results very startling in regard to the amount of mortality attending its performance, due to the circumstances

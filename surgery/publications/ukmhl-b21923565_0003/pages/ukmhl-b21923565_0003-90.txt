OPERA TIONS. 710 excisions of the upper extremity, I have been struck with the great difference in the number of excisions of the wrist and shoulder in comparison with those of the elbow-joint. Looking over my journals of private and hospital cases, I find that this disproportion seems due to three causes :—1st, That diseases of the wrist and shoulder seem to be of very much rarer occurrence ; and 2dly, That they are in the early stages more amenable to treatment; and lastly, That many refuse to submit to any operation till the parts are so disorganised and the health so bad that amputation is the only resource. In one year alone I find that of 7 cases of disease of the shoulder 5 were dismissed cured by the use of the cautery, combined with the use of cod- liver oil, iodide of potash, and nutrient diet, whilst only 2 re- quired excision ; whilst in the same year 5 cases of wrist-disease occurred,—two refused to consent to excision, and were relieved by treatment, one was dismissed cured, in one amputation was performed, and one underwent excision, and recovered. In the lower extremity the results in regard to life are not so favourable. Excision of the knee-joint, so far as the operation has yet been tested, can scarcely contrast favourably with ampu- tation at the lower part of the thigh for disease of the knee- joint. I am aware that favourable comparisons have been made by contrastmg cases of excision of the knee-joint with amputa- tion of the thigh generally ; but the comparison, to be a fair one, must be between cases of amputation performed for diseased conditions similar to those for which the excision is had re- course to. My experience of amputation has shown me that, not only the extent of the limb removed, but also the nature of the disease for which it is removed, make a great difference as to the success or fatality of the operation, and that amputation in cases of simple strumous disease of the knee-joint affords the greatest amount of success ; and this is the class of cases for which we perform excisions. With all my feeling in favour of excision of the knee-joint as a substitute for amputation of the thigh, I cannot help believing that in certain conditions it is more dangerous than amputation, and that the character of the

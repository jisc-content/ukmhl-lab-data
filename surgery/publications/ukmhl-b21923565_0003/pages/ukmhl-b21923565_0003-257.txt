Injuries of the Head.—Whilst each of the various forms of injury occurring in this region possesses its own peculiarities, their chief interest is derived from the effects they may induce, either primarily or secondarily, on the brain and its membranes : so that what appears at first a trifling injury may, unless carefully attended to, lead to a serious or even fatal result. Accordingly, in treating of injuries of the head, we require constantly to keep in mind the nature of the textures injured, and their relation to the brain and its membranes. Injuries of the Scalp have dangers which depend both on the character of the scalp-texture, and on its vascular connections with the cranial bones and the dura mater. The scalp is com- posed of several tissues closely connected. The skin is of close dense texture, and is united by slips of fibrous tissue to the occipito-frontalis, the broad tendinous or aponeurotic expan- sion of which forms a sort of central tendon to the anterior and posterior bellies of that muscle. The interstices between these fibrous connections are filled by a quantity of dense granular fat, and the tissues are largely supplied with blood-vessels and nerves. In the lateral region of the head, we find the strong tem- poral aponeurosis underlying the scalp. The deep surface of the

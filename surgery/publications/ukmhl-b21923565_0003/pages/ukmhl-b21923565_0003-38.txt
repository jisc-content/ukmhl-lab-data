662 OPERA TIONS. internal jugular vein crosses and covers the artery, whilst below the vessel is in relation to the commencement of the right vena innominata. This part of the subclavian is also in close contact with the pleura, and with the great vertebral vein. The latter is very troublesome in the operation, and cannot well be drawn aside, from its being fixed. In most cases of sul^clavian aneurism, where any artery has been tied, the innominate has been the vessel chosen, for the reasons before given ; but when the first part of the subclavian is to be tied, nearly the same incisions are required as in the former operation :â€”one over the inner part of the clavicle, dividing both origins of the sterno-mastoid; and another along the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid, taking care to avoid the external jugular vein, which lies along the outer edge of the muscle. The artery is then exposed by careful dissection, and important structures held aside till the aneurism needle is passed below it and the ligature secured. It might be thought that the chief danger in the operation would be the sudden interruption of the supply of blood to the parts furnished by the subclavian ; but the real danger consists in the tendency which the free and forcible circulation around the deligated point has to disturb the subsequent haemostatic process.

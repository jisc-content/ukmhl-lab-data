The Treatment of this active form of glossitis consists in freely incising the tongue in the longi- tudinal direction, keeping the incisions from the middle line. The incisions are made deeply through the infiltrated texture of the tongue, and afford relief, both by depletion, but especially by the escape of serous and plastic exudation, relieving the tension and swelling. The bleeding, in general, is much less than we might at first expect from incisions in so vascular an organ, but the incisions are not made so deeply into the proper texture of the organ as they seem to be. They pass into the infiltrated structure, and when the swelling subsides, the incisions, which seemed deep gashes when first made, appear as mere superficial scarifications. After the incisions are made, tepid lotions of honey and water, with chlorate of potash or borax, should be used to allay irritation, and the chlorate of potash may be given internally with advantage. The constitutional febrile condition must be treated on general principles, and during convalescence the use of quinine is specially indicated. Chronic Hypertrophy of the Tongue is not very common. In the cases which have come under my notice, the patients have been young, and the disease had apparently been progressing slowly from childhood, the enlargement proceeding more rapidly as the patient grew up. In these cases, although the tongue was of an enormous size, and hung over the chin, the interference with respiration was by no means such as in acute glossitis. The reason of this is, that the jaws and cavity of the mouth, and openings of the nostrils, seem to be gradually accommodated to the great alteration in the size of the tongue. Indeed, the lower

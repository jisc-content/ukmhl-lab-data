SIMPLE DEPRESSED FRACTURE. 881 brain, and so may produce more urgent symptoms ; but here, also, besides the fracture, there is usually extravasation from injury of the vessels at the base of the skull. Simple fracture with depression varies in degree, and the in- tensity of the symptoms of cerebral lesion or of compression will depend, as I have just said, partly on the extent, but principally on the depth of the depression, and whether it be camplieated with intracranial extravasation or fissure extending from the fracture towards or through the base of the skull. When limited, and the depression not deep and uncomplicated with internal hjemorrhage, the symptoms present at first may be merely those of concussion, or of a very slight degree of compression, which, under treatment, will pass away. If, in such a case, the symptoms, instead of diminishing, gradually assume the more decided characters of compression, this increase is pretty clear evidence that the cause of the increased compression is due to extravasation of blood from lacerated vessels, and not to the fracture, as the compres- sion caused by the depressed bone would take place at once and not increase. Indeed, the brain gradually accommodates itself to the compression, originally caused by depressed bone. In children, owing to the soft resilient character of the cranial bones, what was originally a deep depression often disappears, or at least the depressed surface so nearly regains its natural level as not to cause any inconvenience, and scarcely to be per- ceptible to the touch. The correct diaghosis of simple fractures of the cranial bones is most important, as the extravasation into or under the scalp tissue, which has already been spoken of, might mislead the surgeon to suppose there was depressed fracture when no such lesion existed, and so lead to dangerous practice. Compound and compound comminuted fracture may be con- sidered under the same head, as differing only in degree, for all cranial fractures, except simple fissures, are more or less com- minuted. In compound fractures the wound of the scalp enables us to see and feel the extent and nature of the fracture, and to judge of the amount of the depression, and the probability of the existence of depressed sharp projecting points of bone or

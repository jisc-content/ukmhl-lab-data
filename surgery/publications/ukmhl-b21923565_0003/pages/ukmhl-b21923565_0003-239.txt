CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 837 motlier, however, had with her another younger child, evidently affected with strumous swelling of the periosteum, bones, and glands. At the time of the patient's admission into hospital there was no lateral projecting swelling, simply an elongated ovoid swelling, or enlargement of the femur, from the condyles to near the trochanters. Under these circumstances the question arose,â€”Might not these symptoms be caused by periostitis and subacute ostitis, and perhaps incipient necrosis ? To my own mind, the absence of rigors or febrile symptoms at any time during the progress of the disease, the distinct lateral swelling noticed at first, and the peculiar ovoid form of the enlarged femur, seemed pretty conclusive as to its being a malignant tumour of the bone ; but still, imder the circumstances, before proceeding to such an extreme measure as amputation at the hip-joint, I considered it right to resort to an exploratory inci- sion, as recorded in the report. In many instances a free explo- ratory incision will at once satisfy the surgeon as to the true state of matters ; but here it had a tendency to mislead, for, owing to the cancerous deposit being situated partly within the medullary canal of the femur, and partly between the periosteum and the shaft of the bone, and easily separable, it resulted that when I introduced my finger into the incision, I felt the bone bare and loosely connected with swollen periosteum, just as in a case of necrosis, so that I had to enlarge the incision consider- ably to judge of the true state of the swelling. I draw attention to this^ because unless I had been pretty well decided before as to the nature of the disease, the condition presented in this case, so different from the irregular softened mass mixed with osseous spiculfB, generally met with in malignant osseous tumours, might have led to a wrong diagnosis and most disastrous results. The method of operating in this case was the same as that I adopted in the case of L. S., previously recorded, and I think it the best in such cases where we have the power of choosing our procedure. Amputation at the hip can be readily performed by cu+ting one very large anterior flap, and disarticulating and dividing the posterior parts almost directly backwards ; but as

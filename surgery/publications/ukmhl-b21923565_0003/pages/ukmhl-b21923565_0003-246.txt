842 AMPUTATION. on the 1st of January 1848 for a short time, at which period a great part of the wound had cicatrised. On the 8th of January the ligature from the upper part of the axillary artery separated (this ligature had been marked at the time of the operation by a double knot on its free extremity ; the ligature from the lower part of the vessel, where it had been divided in the amputation, came away on the 17th of December). In the beginning of February the wound was completely healed, with the exception of one part about the circumference of a sixpence, where a ligature projected, this I took away some time afterwards, and then this remaining part also healed up rapidly. Remarks.—This case affords an example of the great amount of injury from which the system may recover ; and the results of this and similar cases warrant us in entertaining hope and having recourse to operative measures even in the most aggra- vated cases. Few examples of injury could have presented a more frightful appearance, or less likelihood of a favourable re- sult, not so much from the shattered state of the arm and the quantity of blood he had lost, as on account of the extent of the laceration of the soft parts covering the chest, one side being almost denuded of its cutaneous and muscular coverings, and the patient lying cold, pallid, and collapsed, from the effects of the severe suffering he had undergone. From the state in which I found him, I have little doubt that, had he been removed even a short distance to obtain surgi- cal aid, the result M'ould probably have been very different. Indeed, from what I have seen of primary amputations, I believe that the very different results of such amputations in civil hos- pitals and military practice, and the comparatively greater suc- cess which will be found in private practice over hospital cases, is owing in a great measure to the fact, that in military and private civil practice, the operation is performed either on the spot, or at a short distance only from where the accident occurred, so that the patient undergoes but one shock ; whereas a majority of the cases presented to the surgeon in hospital prac- tice, are often brought from a considerable distance, not in the easiest or most eligible conveyances,—and thus the patient, just recovering from the first effects of severe injury, is subjected to a second shock, or rather series of shocks, from the jolting of the

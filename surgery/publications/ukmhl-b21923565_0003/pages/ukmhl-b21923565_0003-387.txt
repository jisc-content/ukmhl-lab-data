TUMOURS OF THE JAW. 979 operations enable us to fill up the gap. In one case of malignant tumour of the upper jaw, which I alluded to when lecturing on Fig. 26. malignant tumours of bone, and in which all the soft textures of the cheek required to be removed with the growth, I dissected a large flap to form a new cheek, and the patient made a good re- covery at the time, although she died about two years afterwards from recurrence of the disease in the superior maxilla of the opposite side. The appearance of the patient immediately before and after the operation, is shown in Plate xlv. Figs. 1 and 2. I shall now proceed to the operations required for the removal of such tumours.

For in the case of tumours arising in the antrum, we have not the same limita- tion.

982 REGIONAL SURGERY. Fig. 27. tumour of a non-malignant character exists in the lower jaw, we do not require to remove tlie angle of the jaw or the chin, but merely to go a little beyond the tumour on each side ; and in such cases as that repre- sented in Fig. 27, affecting the centre of the lower jaw, we do not require to remove the lateral portions of the bone, when we merely require to remove the tumours along with a small portion of the jaw on either side of it, and we may do this and leave very little deformity. In a case I operated on lately for disease of the bone, the diseased portion in- cluded nearly the two-thirds of the horizontal portion of the jaw, and yet it was removed with hardly any external incision. I merely made a small incision on either side, to allow me to introduce a small saw to cut through the bone. The lip was then turned down without cutting it, and the mucous membrane and soft parts separated from the bone. The precaution was taken to fix the point of the tongue, which might retract and turn upon itself, and suffocate the patient. In any tumour not involving the angle of the jaw, this plan may be followed out, without making any large external incision, and merely leaving a small opening for the escape of the discharges from the wound, if necessary. In other cases, where we have a tumour of the lower jaw occupying nearly the whole of one side of the bone, if the tumour be at all of a doubtful character, the whole lateral portions of the jaw ought to be removed by disarticu- lation, because if we leave a portion, such as the angle of the jaw, then if the disease should return, and we subsequently require to disarticulate, the difficulty of doing so becomes very great from the want of leverage, and in some cases the use of forceps to grasp the bone will not answer, as the bone is soft, and gives way under their pressure. Then we require to dissect the part out, which is both difficult and dangerous. Hence, I think, the best plan in all

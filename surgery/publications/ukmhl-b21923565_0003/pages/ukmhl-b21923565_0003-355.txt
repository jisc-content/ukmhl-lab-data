NASAL POLYPI. 947 vacated by their more advanced predecessors. It is therefore not a recurrent tumour; but we cannot always be sure of re- moving every polypus. Their most usual habitat is the mucous sur» face of the superior and middle turbinated bones. From this posi- tion they often hang in clusters down the nostrils. A polypus occupying the anterior nostril, with a long narrow attachment, may slip backwards into the posterior part. We should, therefore, always introduce a finger into the mouth, and feel the posterior nostril, in order to ascertain if there are any polypi there. The diagnosis of nasal polypus is usually simple enough ; at the same time, we must see that it is really a polypus we have to deal with. It often happens that a patient has the ordinary symptoms of polypus, and that the surgeon supposes he sees one when there are none present. The mucous lining over the inferior turbinated bone is often congested and oedematous, and looks exactly like a polypus, and the septum between the nostrils is sometimes placed unevenly, and has the appearance of a polypus. Hence we require to be careful in examining the nostril; but once we have ascertained the presence of such a growth, the treat- ment is very simple. To remove these simple polypi, we introduce a pair of polypus forceps into the nostril, by means of which a firm hold is taken of the • root of the polypus ; which is then wrenched or twisted off from its attachment. This is repeated until all the growths which can be seen or felt are removed. In some cases, where there are a number of small polypi which are difficult to get hold of, I proceed as if I were going to plug the posterior nares, by using a small plug, and drawing it forwards. By this means I often drag away any small polypi which may be present; and though it looks a harsh proceeding it is not a painful one.

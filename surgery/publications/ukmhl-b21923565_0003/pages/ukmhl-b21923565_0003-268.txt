LECTURE XCII. Eationale of Treatment of Head Injuries founded upon the Pathological Conditions attending them—The immediate and more remote Dangers following Reaction in Concussion : Symptoms attending them ; Indications to be derived from these—Active and Passive Extravasation: Diagnosis of its Site—Inflammation of the Brain and its Membranes—Suppuration within the Cranium—Evacua- tion of the Pus by Perforation. I HAVE stated dogmatically the treatment whicli experience has convinced me to be that best suited to ward off subsequent evUs, because I think that in cases of emergency it is well that young practitioners should have the general plan of treatment before them in a distinct and easily remembered form. But to enable you to understand the grounds on which the method of treatment is founded, requires me to proceed now to consider the dangers which are liable to follow on concussion, during or subsequent to the reactionary stage. These dangers are, first, internal haemorrhage, in either an active or passive form, leading to compression or disease of the brain. Secondly, inflammation of the brain or its membranes, resulting in effusion of serum or coagulable lymph on the surface of the brain, softening of the brain substance, or the formation of purulent matter within the cranium. The danger which is likely to follow most immediately during reaction, or after it is fairly established, is Intracranial HAEMORRHAGE, and I shall therefore begin by considering its causes and effects. The cause of intracranial extravasation in concussion may be said in general terms to be rupture of some blood-vessels, generally of small size, by the force which caused the concussion. During the state of shock and collapse the depressed state of the circulation prevents active bleeding; but when reaction commences and proceeds, the circulation becomes excited, and then the ruptured vessels pour out their contents,

793 AMPUTATION OF FOREARM. Ivnife, and separates the long square flap so marked out rapidly up to its base. The bones are then cleared and sawn through, and the operation completed, care being taken to adjust the angles of the flaps exactly to each other. The vessels which require to be secured after amputation of the forearm are the radial, ulnar, and interosseous. The two first are easily seen and secured. The radial lies very superficial and to the outer side of the anterior flap. The ulnar is deeper, and in muscular limbs sometimes retracts a little, but the position of the ulnar nerve at once guides to the vessel. The posterior inter- osseous and its branches are seen on the posterior flap, but the anterior interosseous, which lies deep, is sometimes difficult to secure, as it retracts amongst the deep nmscles. It should always be looked for and secured, as it may cease to bleed at the time of the operation, but is sure to bleed and give rise to trouble afterwards. In this operation, and indeed in all amputations, the nerves should be drawn out a little, and cut short, so as to prevent them becoming adherent over the bone, or in the cicatrix, as shown in Plate xxxiii. Figs. 1, 2, and so giving rise to a pain- ful stumj).

803 AMPUTATION OF ARM AND SCAPULA. its lower border, but there is no necessity for carrying this lower part of the incision towards the sternum further than to curve it slightly. The posterior flap is then to be dissected rapidly back, so as to expose the base of the scapula. The oper- ator should then divide the integuments and humeral attach- ments of the pectoralis muscle in the line marked out for the anterior flap, and clear and saw through the clavicle on the sternal side of the coraco-clavicular ligament. This will enable him by a few touches of the knife to expose the axillary and supra-scapular vessels, and he can secure them at once, either by the assistant grasping them between his fingers, or, better, by tying them with double ligatures and dividing them. By this procedure the haemorrhage from the great vessels and the sub- scapular and supra-scapular branches will be avoided. The flaps now being held aside, the attachments of the trapezius to the scupula are divided. The scapula and arm are drawn outwards by the assistant, and the scapular attachments of the serratus magnus, rhomoid, and levator anguli scapulae muscles being stretched, are severed by a stroke of the knife, and the operation completed. The artery of the base of the scapula will be now divided and require ligature. Some advise that when the base of the scapula is exposed by dissecting the posterior flap, the muscles attaching the scapula to the trunk should be divided, the arm and scapula thrown forwards, the clavicle sawn through or disarticulated, and the anterior flap formed in cutting out. 1 prefer the method T have described, specially as preventing loss of blood as far as possible, but also because the division of the scapular attachment of the serratus is more easily accomplished after the clavicle is sawn through, and the scapula drawn from the side. Eemoval of the scapula alone, for tumours, will be considered when treating of operations in the axillary region.

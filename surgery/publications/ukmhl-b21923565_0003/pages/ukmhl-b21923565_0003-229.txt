CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 827 cupied was a small closet, low in the ceiling, just large enough to contain a small fixed bedstead, leaving barely room to pass between the bed and the wall,â€”its only means of ventilation a small window and the door opening into the common room of the family, which also contained beds, so that whatever the purity of air in the country round, he did not enjoy much of it. Without denying the bad effects of vitiated air in hospital wards, and the necessity of doing all we can to remove that cause of mischief, I cannot help saying that a good deal of nonsense is spoken and written about the dangers of operations in hospitals as compared with those in private practice, as if all depended on hospital air alone. From some of the discussions on the subject by correspondents in the weekly medical journals, and from recent proposed methods of ascertaining the results of surgical operations in hospitals, it would almost seem as if some statis- ticians had so crammed their brains with mere figures as to have no room left for a single idea, or even so small a glimmer- ing of common sense as to make allowance for the nature and class of cases admitted into great hospitals, or to pay the least attention to the circumstances under which the patients are when admitted. As to the operation itself, the difficulties were only such as must always more or less present themselves in operating in cases of injury, where the lacerated textures prevent iis from obtaining regular flaps, and where the comminution of the bone deprives the operator of the power of leverage to facilitate dis- articulation. There was, however, comparatively little difficulty here, although the fragment I had to grasp was small, because I had taken care to pass the knife deeply so as to open the front of the joint in cutting the anterior flap, and by doing so the difficulty of disarticulating was much diminished. There was however, a condition present which I have seen cause serious difficulty in amputation of the thigh for compound comminuted fractures when transfixion was attempted, I mean the dragging up of the lower part of the femur, by the hamstring and adduc- tor muscles, and the projection of the trochanteric or upper part 3 I

Simple Polypus of the Nostril is a very common affec- tion. I have already spoken of it, as an example of simple vascular sarcoma, when lecturing on tumours. The general symptoms which indicate its presence are a feeling of stuffing of the nose, as if from a cold in the head, and an increased secretion of mucus from the nostrils. As both these symptoms are increased in cold damp weather, the patient for some time attributes his symptoms to a cold; but as they become persistent, and the difficulty of breathing through the nostrils becomes greater, he examines his' nostril, and detects a soft swelling ; or some of his friends observe it. In many cases the bulky mass presses on the margin of the inferior turbinated bone, and obstructs the flow of tears through the nasal duct, and they then flow over the cheek, giving rise to one form of Epiphora. When any of the polypi project towards the pharynx through the posterior nares, the patient feels as if some mucus were adhering to the back of the throat, and is constantly hawk- ing and spitting to get rid of it. When very long and pendul- ous in this position, the irritation of the fauces sometimes excites vomiting. In many cases the projection of a polypus may so press upon the orifice of the Eustachian tube as to cause deaf- ness. In all cases, as the growths enlarge and fill the nostril, the sense of smell is impaired, and the voice is indistinct and snuffling, and when the patient falls asleep he snores loudly. In some extreme cases, more especially in cases of fibrous

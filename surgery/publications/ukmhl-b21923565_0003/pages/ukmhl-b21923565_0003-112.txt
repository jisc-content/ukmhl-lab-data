OPERA TIONS. 730 the wound, whilst an assistant uses the thigh as a lever to project and twist outwards the head of the femur, and render the capsule tense over it. Insinuating his finger between the upper part of the capsule and the soft parts in front of it, he should introduce the blunt-pointed knife, guarded by his finger, and turning its edge towards the capsule cut directly down upon the projected head of the femur. This will open the capsule, and then the head of the femur will be readily turned out, for the round ligament is usually destroyed by disease; if not, it can now be easily divided, and the section of the bone performed. Any vessels which may bleed are then secured, the acetabulum examined, and the gouge applied to remove all disease that can be removed with safety or without per- forating into the pelvis. "When all oozing has ceased, the wound is closed by sutures, and the limb either laid on padded wire-splint, kept straight by means of the bracketed long-splint, or the extension pulleys, as in fracture of the thigh; only we must avoid much extension, as our object is merely to keep the limb straight and not to keep it of the full length of the opposite, but rather to afford every facility for osseous or firm, fibrous anchylosis at the hip taking place. Excision of the Knee-Joint has been performed by various methods—1st, The H incision—two lateral incisions over the outer and inner sides of the joint, connected by a transverse incision in front across the patella. 2d, A single longitudinal incision in the axis of the limb, commencing about two and a half or three inches above the patella, and carried down over the centre of the joint to below the insertion of the ligamentum patell£e ; the textures being dissected off laterally to expose the joint, allow the ligaments to be divided and the articular ends of the bones to be sawn off. Lastly, A gently-curved incision from one condyle of the femur to the other, passing below the patella, the convexity of the curve corresponding nearly to the upper margin of the head of the tibia ; the semilunar flap, so marked out on being dissected up, freely exposing the

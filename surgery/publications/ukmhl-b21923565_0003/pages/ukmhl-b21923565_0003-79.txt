EXCISION OF JOINTS. G99 that we are very differently situated in regard to our power of effecting them in excisions of the upper and lower limbs. In the former, if we perform the operation intelligently in reference to the objects to be accomplished, we can in general effect these fully and obtain brilliant results ; whilst in the arti- culations of the lower extremity, the paramount object,—that of removing all diseased structure,—cannot always be fully ac- complished in some, whilst in others we are obliged to sacrifice the mobility of the joint to the necessity of having a sufficient support. I shall, therefore, first speak of the excisions of the upper extremity, as affording the most perfect examples of this operation. In performing excision of the articulations of the upper ex- tremity, we wish to remove all disease and to obtain a false articulation, which, under the control of the muscles, will admit of either the natural movements of the joint, or movements so closely resembling them that the use of the limb is but little impaired. To effect these objects, we require to plan our incisions so that they may avoid division of muscles or tendons, so far as compatible with exposure of parts necessary for the complete re- moval of the diseased structures. With this view our incisions should be parallel to the axis of the limb, or nearly so, that the cicatrices may not interfere with the movements of the joint subsequently to the cure, and to facilitate the after-treatment and permit of passive motion being begun at an early period, even before the union of the wound has taken place ; this is specially important in the case of excisions of the elbow, but the principle is applicable to all excisions of the upper extremity. So far as possible, complete transverse division of muscles or tendons should be avoided, by making our section of muscvilar fibres more or less oblique, so that the divided fibres may unite more readily and with less loss of power. For example, in dividing the attachment of the triceps in excising the elbow, I divide it freely, from and on either side of the olecranon, by two oblique incisions uniting above at an acute angle so as to form

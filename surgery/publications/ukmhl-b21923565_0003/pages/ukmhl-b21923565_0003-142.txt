LECTURE LXXXV. Amputiation continued—Prevention of Hremorrliage diu'ing the Operation, and its arrestment afterwards—Immediate and After-treatment of Stumps. As regards the arrestment of haemorrhage in amputation, we have, first, to attend to the temporary bleeding during an operation; and, secondly, its permanent arrestment after the operation. In the great amputations in private, and also in hospital practice, the ordinary tourniquet is the safest instrument for ar- resting bleeding during the operation. At one time this method was objected to as entailing a larger loss of venous blood than necessary ; bvit this is more a theoretical than a practical objec- tion, for if the ordinary surgical tourniquet be put on properly, and not screwed up till that is done completely, no great loss of venous blood will take place. If it be screwed up partially, the veins will become congested, and so venous haemorrhage will take place; but in that case the fault is in the method of using it, and not in the instrument itself. There are various tourniquets in use ; some are made so as to compress only two points of the limb—namely, over the main artery and a point directly opposite—these instruments control the flow of blood through the main channel, but allow the intermediate col- lateral circulation to be carried on, and are therefore not so good as the common one. In an oedematous limb the tourniquet is very apt to get slack as the serous fluid escapes, and we should there- fore be careful, if the serum escapes rapidly, to tighten it so as to prevent any loss of blood. It is better to compress the main artery by means of the fingers, if we have a good assistant, for this does not interfere with the retraction of the muscles. "When the tourniquet is used, the muscles are pre- vented from retracting to their full extent at the time, and on

As regards Chronic Diseases of the Tonsils, Ave have chronic enlargement of them with condensation of their tex- ture. In delicate children this very often occurs, and they may attain to such a size that the two tonsils almost close up the fauces, and give rise to difficult breathing, especially at night when the patient lies on his back, and the nares become plugged with mucus. It is altogether a very unhealthy state of matters, for it interferes with the proper aeration of the blood, and therefore the sooner the disease is removed the better. The tonsils, on examination, are seen to be of a pale colour, and of a pretty firm consistence, though occasionally they may be somewhat vascular and spongy ; these latter cases being not so favourable as the others. They nearly meet in the middle line, and they also project both upwards and downwards between the pillars of the fauces. In these cases, the simplest and the best treatment is the removal of the projecting portion of the glandâ€” Excision of the tonsil, as it is generally called. This is an unfortunate name, for we do not excise the tonsil; we merely cut off a po]:tion of it, and su^b- sequently condensation of the remaining portion of the tonsil occurs, and the part contracts.

We should remove both tonsils

Amputation conti?med—Mr. Teale's Method, by a Long Anterior and Short Pos- terior Flap : its Advantages and Disadvantages—The Author's Method, by- Long Anterior Flap—Mr. Garden's Method. In 1858 the late Mr. Teale of Leeds published an account of his method of amputation by a long and a short rectangular flap. The mode of performing the operation, and the objects proposed to be attained, may be given in Mr. Teale's own words. " To procure a more useful stump, and in the hope of somewhat dimin- ishing the mortality of the operation, it is proposed to amputate by a long and a short rectangular flap; the long flap, folding- over the end of the bone, being formed of parts generally devoid of large blood-vessels and nerves, whilst these important struc- tures are contained in the short flap. " The size of the long flap is determined by the circumference of the limb at the place of amputation, its length and its breadth being each equal to half the circumference. The long flap is therefore a perfect square, and is long enough to fall easily over the end of the bone. In selecting the structures for its forma- tion, such parts must be taken as do not contain the larger blood-vessels and nerves. A flap so formed will be, for the most part, anterior in position, as far as regards the general aspect of the body, but superior when the patient is in the recumbent position, as during the after-treatment. The short flap, contain- ing the chief vessels and nerves, is in length one-fourth of the other. The flaps being formed, the bone sawn, and the arteries tied, the long flap is folded over the end of the bone ; each of its free angles is then fixed by suture to the corresponding free angle of the short flap. One or two more sutures complete the transverse line of union of the flaps. At each side the short flap is united to the corresponding portion of the long one by a

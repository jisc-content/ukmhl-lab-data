The general subject of amputation lias now been fully discussed. It therefore only remains for me to consider, as briefly as pos- sible, tlie Special Amputations. I shall begin with those of the upper extremity. Amputation of the Distal Phalanx of a Finger is an operation which is seldom performed on the living body. In cases where the part is diseased, we generally wait until the bone has become loosened by exfoliation, and then separate it through a free longitudinal incision made in front of or at the side of the finger. By these means the digital extre- mity is saved, and a more satisfactory result obtained than could be by amputation. When the same part of the finger is injured by an accident to such an extent as to warrant its removal, the soft textures are generally so much destroyed as not to leave sufficient material for the formation of a flap to cover the end of the bone. The operation is one, however, which the student may practise, with advantage to himself, on the dead subject, as giving him neatness and dexterity in per- forming disarticulation. In amputating the distal phalanx of the flnger, we must keep in mind that the proximal end of the phalanx has a slight projection, which overlaps the articular end of the middle phalanx, when the finger is kept straight; but when the distal

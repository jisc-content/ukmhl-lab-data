Amputation of the Leg may Le performed either by the modified circiolar method, or by the long posterior flap, or by Teale's method of a long anterior skin flap. "When the operation is performed for chronic disease, the muscles of the calf are generally atrophied and somewhat condensed ; and, in such cases, the long posterior flap method is, I consider, preferable to any other, as affording a well-covered stump on wtiich the weight of the body may rest; and the patient is thus enabled to walk with ease. This plan of operating, and its results, are shown in Plate xl. If the right leg is to be amputated, the operator stands on the inner side of the limb, places the heel of his knife over the outer margin of the fibula, carries the blade across the front of the leg until the point reaches a little behind the inner edge of the tibia. He then, without moving the point from the incision, transfixes the limb, and cuts out a long gently- rounded flap from the calf of the leg. The skin and flap are retracted, the bones cleared and sawn through a little higher than the point of transfixion. The point of election for section of the bones should be very little above the middle of the leg. In young patients or females, where there is a considerable amount of fat, a flap of skin may be obtained, by cutting from without inwards, and the limb removed near its lower third; but the cases requiring amputation of the leg seldom admit of the operation being performed lower than the middle of the leg. In sawing the bones, it is sometimes recommended to remove

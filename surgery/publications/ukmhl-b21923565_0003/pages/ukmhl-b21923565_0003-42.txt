OPERA TIONS. 666 o only seen two instances of irregularity in the third portion of the subclavian, in both of which the artery passed in front of the scalenus, so as to be in apposition to the subclavian vein, and in both cases the irregularity was on the right side. The third part of the subclavian is usually described as not giving off any branches ; but I believe it is almost as common to find the posterior scapular artery coming off from the subclavian close to the outer edge of the scalenus, as to find it arising from a common trunk with the ascending cervical from the thyroid axis, which is generally stated to be its usual mode of origin. The anastomoses to which we chiefly trust for restoring the circulation after deligation of the external third of the subclavian are—\st, The supra-scapular, with the dorsal branches of the subscapular artery in the substance of the supra- and infra- spinatus and teres minor muscles. 2d, The posterior scapular artery, with branches from the subscapular along the inferior costa and base of the scapula, and in the substance of the sub- scaprdar muscle. 3f?, Minute perforating branches from the internal mammary and intercostal arteries, inosculating with thoracic branches of the acromio-thoracic artery and other thoracic branches given off by the axillary. But, besides these more evident and direct anastomoses, the determination of blood on the collateral circulation which follows the obstruction of the subclavian artery brings into play vascular communications throughout all the surrounding tissues. As ligature of the middle part of the subclavian has never been performed except as an extension of operations origi- nally undertaken with the view of tying the external third, in which, owing to disease of that part of the vessel, it was found necessary to divide the scalenus to reach a healthy part of the artery, it is unnecessary to describe it as a special operation. But to consider the further procedure in such cases in connection with the operation for tying the third portion of the artery :— The external third of the subclavian may be reached so as to apply a ligature, by means of a single incision parallel to and about eight lines above the clavicle, extending from the anterior

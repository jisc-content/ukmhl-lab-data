OPERATION OF TREPAN. 897 pressed, we are able to remove it and thus gain room to enable ns to deal with the other portions, as on examination may seem best (see Plate xliv. Figs. 2, 3, and 4). When we require to use the trephine in fracture of the skull, whilst the general principles regarding its use are the same as I have already described when operating for evacuating for blood or pus, yet there are im- portant modifications in its application which we must attend to. In cases of depressed fracture, it is usually recommended to place the crown of the trephine on the sound bone, close to the de- pressed edge, as represented in the accompanying woodcut, so as to get the elevator introduced below the depressed edge, to raise it, using the sound unfissured margin of the trephine wound as the fulcrum for the lever. If the object in view in such cases was always and only elevation of the depressed edge, the principle would be correct enough ; although even then we would fre- quently find, that, owing to the depressed edge carrying along with it a shelving portion of the internal table from the undepressed part of the bone on which the trephine had been placed, we might not be able to intro- duce or use the elevator without a further section being made. My own experience in a very considerable number of cases in which I have operated, and others where I have assisted in operations for depressed and comminuted fractures of the skull, enables me to state that the removal of detached and depressed portions of bone is much more generally necessitated than mere elevation of the depressed margin, and hence our application of the trephine should be arranged so as to enable us to effect both objects with as little removal of sound bone as possible. In many instances we can effect this, as I shall show you, without using the trephine at all ; but supposing Fig. 6.

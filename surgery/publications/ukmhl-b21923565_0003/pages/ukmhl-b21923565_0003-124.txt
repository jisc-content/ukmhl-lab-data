740 OPERA TIONS. course of time disappeared altogether ; and thirdly, that the manner in which the nerves were cut favoured the development of neuromata. With regard to the first of these objections, sub- sequent experience has shown me that it possesses much force. In order to determine how far the two latter assertions were correct, I made a series of dissections, which included stumps formed by both methods of amputation. Several of these dissec- tions are now in the University Museum, and others in my private collection. As the result of this investigation, I may state, without entering into details, that, whilst the muscula'^ substance retained in flap operations was observed to be dimi- nished in bulk, the decrease in many cases had not occurred at all to the extent which a 'priori reasoning might lead us to expect. Thus, in a flap amputation of the leg, which I dissected twelve years after the operation, the portion of the gastrocnemius cover- ing the end of the bone had scarcely undergone any change ; and in a dissection of a hip-joint stump, three years after the operation, the coarse muscular fasciculi of the gluteus were dis- tinct and of natural appearance up to the very cicatrix ; and in almost every case, the muscular tissue, even when greatly altered in character, coidd still be traced as a thick fibrous layer under the integument. As regards the presence of neuromata, or enlarge- ments on the extremities of the divided nerves, I found that these were equally present in all forms of stumps, and even when the nerves were deeply covered ; that, in fact, a greater or less enlargement of the end of a nerve was a necessary consequence of its division. From a careful examination, with low magnify- ing powers, of such neuromata in dissected stumps, and of those which I had removed from stumps in the living, I found that they consisted of consolidated lymph, deposited amongst the fibrillfe of the nerve ; and, as explanatory of their origin, I think it probable, as I stated in a notice of this subject before the Anatomical Society of Edinburgh, that when a nerve is divided the neurilemma retracts to a greater extent than the contained fibrilla3, which, being thus set at liberty, spread out and separate from each other; that lymph is then effused in the spaces between

912 DISEASES OF SCALP. bones, has been already treated of as resulting from injury, or caused by specific forms of disease, such as syphilis or struma, or the effects of mercury. I need not therefore enter on the subject here, further than to point out that whilst the general rule in cases of necrosis—viz. to wait for the natural vital separa- tion of exfoliations before attempting their removal—is appKcable here as in other situations ; yet, from the proximity of the diseased bone to the membranes of the brain, cases do occur in which, in consequence of cerebral irritation, it becomes necessary to inter- fere to remove the diseased bone earlier in order to get rid of an obvious source of irritation, and prevent the accumulation of purulent matter. Again, in many cases of cranial exfoliations, it will be found that vital separation has really taken place, but the flattened surfaces adhere, and are retained by atmospheric pressure, and that on elevating one edge, the whole exfoliation comes away with perfect ease. As to other local treatment, it consists in the application of red oxide of mercury, or dilute nitric acid, together with the use of charcoal poultices, to destroy any remaining vitality in the exfoliation, and hasten its separation from the healthier parts, followed by weak solutions of carbolic acid, or of the chlorides of zinc or soda, as lotions to correct the foetor and promote a gently stimulating effect on the sur- rounding tissues.

LECTUKE LXXV. Operation for tlie Ligature of Arteries—Importance of a Knowledge of the Rela- tive Anatomy of the Part to be operated on—Nature of the Incisions re- quired—Exposure of Artery : Opening of Sheath—Passing of Needle— Apparatus required. Ligature of Innominate Artery—Ligature of the Common Carotid Artery—Ligature of the First Part of the Subclavian Artery. As I have fully discussed the effects of ligature of arteries, and the injuries and diseases of the arterial system which re- quire surgical treatment, I now proceed to describe and demonstrate the operative procedures for applying the ligature to the principal arteries. It is not my intention to describe the various methods which have been adopted by different surgeons, but rather to employ the time allotted to this part of the course to careful and accurate demonstration of the points most essential to be attended to, in what from experience I have found to be the best plans of procedure. In every surgical operation a thorough knowledge of the structure of the parts to be operated on is necessary ; but in very few operations is it so necessary as in those performed with the view of reaching and tying important arteries. In these operations it is generally amongst organs of vital importance that the surgeon has to direct his instruments, so that by carelessness or the least deviation he may wound structures essential to life. And in all cases, uncertain and difficult manipulations, if they do not lead to immediately fatal accidents, are almost sure to be followed by secondary haemorrhage. Surgical anatomy, then, consisting of an accurate knowledge of relative anatomy, and of the functions of the different structures likely to be implicated in the operation, is the only secure basis on which to practise the operations on arteries. And I shall therefore preface each operation by a brief but careful examination

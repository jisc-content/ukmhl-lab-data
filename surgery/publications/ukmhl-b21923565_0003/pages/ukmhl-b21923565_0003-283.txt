LECTURE XCIIL Injuries of the Cranial Bones—Contusions—Fractures—Ecrasement or Smash— Fractures with and without Depression, as Fissures, and Simple, Compound, Compound Comminuted, and Punctured Fractures — Fractui-es of Base of Skull—General Symptoms and Treatment exemplified by Cases. The effects of injuries of the cranial bones come next to be considered. For the sake of brevity, I shall treat of them under the heads of Contusion and Fracture. Contusion of the Cranial Bones is almost invariably com- bined with more or less severe concussion, and it may be attended by internal extravasation and other results of concussion already alluded to. More especially, I believe it to be the form of injury most likely to lead to suppuration between the bone and dura mater, in consequence of the impaired vitality of the bone, and its separation from the pericranial and meningeal connections, giving rise to unhealthy action. These conditions having been already fully considered, I will, under this head, merely allude to the fact, that contusion of the cranial bones, apart from the more immediate and urgent conditions already spoken of, may give rise to chronic affections of a serious nature, from cario-necrosis of the injured bone leading to alteration of the membranes of the brain and ery- sipeloid affections of the scalp ; or, the injured bone may become thickened, or irregularly nodulated on its internal surface, so as to press upon and excite chronic disease of the brain itself. In such cases epileptic attacks are very commonly the result; and occasionally intermittent maniacal symptoms supervene, when, from any exciting cause, an exacerbation of the chronic ostitis is induced. I need hardly say, that when once such a state of matters is established, our remedies are not very efficacious, and that we

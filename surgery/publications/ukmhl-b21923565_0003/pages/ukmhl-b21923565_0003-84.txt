OPERATIONS. 704 rated by experience iu the cases on which I have myseK operated, and the larger experience of other surgeons. The results, as to the use of the limb and the little lameness observable in walk- ing, have, I confess, surprised me. In one case of a young woman, on whom I operated in 1858, and in whom I removed more than the usual amount of bone, having thought it necessary to remove a second section from the condyles of the femur, I dreaded that the lameness would be very great, and she had a high-heeled boot fitted for the foot of the affected limb. A year afterwards I was astonished to see her at the hospital walking with scarcely a perceptible halt, and she informed me that the high-heeled boot hindered her walking, and, on using an ordinary shoe, she found her ease in movement so much greater that she had thrown aside the high-heeled boot; and this, I may state, has been the experience of all my patients, viz. that they walk best with a shoe or boot similar to that on the healthy foot. In other words, the obliquity of the pelvis, though scarcely notice- able, compensates for the shortening, whilst the movements of the hip and ankle joints compensate for the loss of motion in the knee ; so that, in most cases, the limb left after excision of the knee-joint is very different from an artificial support, as regards the ease of the patient's progression. But, to take another aspect of this objection,â€”no surgeon would hesitate to prefer cure by anchylosis in the straight position in a case of diseased knee, to amputation of the limb. Now, that is just the result obtained by excision. In some cases it would appear that a joint which, after resec- tion, was pretty firmly anchylosed, may gradually, from alteration in the bones, become movable, and form a false joint. I recently saw a patient under the care of my colleague Dr. Gillespie, in whom that gentleman had excised the knee, with a favourable result, three years ago, so that the man returned to his occupation, that of a miner. Gradually, however, his health became im- paired, and he had pains in the parts near the wound. The anchylosis gradually gave way, and, after a variety of treatment, he insisted on amputation being performed. On section of the

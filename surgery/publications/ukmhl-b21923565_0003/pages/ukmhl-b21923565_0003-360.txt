REGIONAL SURGERY. 952 cheeks are full, and their textures healthy, and in which the septum nasi is tolerably entire, a very presentable nose may be formed by flaps dissected from the cheeks by the following method :—Two thick flaps of skin, of the form shown in the ac- companying woodcut (Fig. 12), are traced on the cheeks, and then dissected np, taking care to retain sufficient substance to ensure vascular supply. These flaps are then brought forward without twist- ing, and, when all oozing has ceased, the margins A B and A c are approximated and retained by points of silver suture. The outer margins at E and D are attached by silver suture at such a distance from the openings of the nose as would correspond to the original alee nasi, and the remainder of the outer free margins implanted into the raw surface by points of silver suture, or small pins pushed in obliquely. After the lapse of forty- eight hours a small dossil of lint may be introduced to raise the flaps and give form to the nose, and that eleva.tion is gradually increased after union has taken place. Lateral pressure from without by forceps made for the purpose may also be used with advantage at a later period, but the effects of pressure must be watched. Lastly, when two or three months have elapsed, and union is thoroughly effected, the columna nasi is formed by cutting it from the upper lip, as first practised and described by Mr. Listen. " The inner surface of the apex is first pared. A sharp-pointed bistoury is then passed through the upper lip—previously stretched and raised by an assistant—close to the ruins of the former columna, and about an eighth of an inch on one side of the mesial line. The incision is continued down, in a straight direction, to the free margin of the lip ; and a similar one, parallel to the former, is

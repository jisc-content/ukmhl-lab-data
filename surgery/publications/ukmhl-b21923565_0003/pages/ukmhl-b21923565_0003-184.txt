Amputation at the Elbow-Joint is seldom performed, because in the cases where it would be desirable we can rarely get a suf- ficiency of sound texture to form a covering for the large condy- loid end of the bone. In a case in which I operated for the effects of an old burn, I had to form a long flap from the soft parts on the outer side of the forearm, and a flap from that posi- tion, or from the inner side, may occasionally be obtained in cases of recent injury, to enable us to get a covering. The preferable method, when we have the choice, is to cut a long flap from the anterior aspect of the joint, and a smaller one posteriorly, either by transfixion immediately below the condyles, and cutting towards the surface so as to form a long flap, as represented in Fig. 2, Plate xxxvi., and then dividing the soft parts on the back by a circular cut; or by cutting a similar fla]3 from the surface inwards, then opening the joint in front, dividing the lateral ligaments, and separating the attachment of the triceps to the olecranon process, so as to complete the removal of the forearm. The restilt of this method is shown in PJate xxxvi. Fig. 3. When the arteries are secured and the nerves cut short, the anterior flap folds over the condyles, and is easily main- tained in position. Amputation of the Upper Arm is perhaps the simplest of

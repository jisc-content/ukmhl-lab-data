AMPUTA TION A T SHO ULDER-JOINT. 799 coid process, instead of the V-shaped incision then practised here. In performing the operation on the living subject, I was struck, not only by the ease with which disarticulation could thus be accomplished, but also by observing that, from the deltoid being di- vided so far forward, there was no trouble with bleeding from the trunk of the pos- terior circumflex artery, which in other methods is always divided and often proves troiiblesome. In demonstrat- ing the operation to my class at that time, I j^ointed out that it possessed another ad- vantage—namely, that if, in proceeding to excise the head of the humerus, the injury or disease were found to be more extensive than anticipated, we could form—by simply carrying the incision back towards the posterior fold of the axilla, as I then expressed myself—a very tolerable stump. But when, after performing the excision, I completed the demonstration by converting the excision into an amputation, it struck me that the result would be even better than that of the ordinary method. Accordingly I determined to adopt it on the first suitable case which I met with. Some short time afterwards two cases of injury were sent to my care requiring amputation at the shoulder: one the result of a railway accident, shattering and tearing the upper arm; the other, a gunshot wound shattering the tuberosities and shaft. In these two cases I carried out the plan, and the result was so perfect in both that I have always since resorted to it in every instance where the nature of the case admitted of its performance. Indeed, the only instances in which I could not perform it have been two : the one a case of se-

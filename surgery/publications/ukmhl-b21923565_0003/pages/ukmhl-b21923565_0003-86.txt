706 OPERATIONS. the acetabulum is generally affected at the stage in which we would be warranted in abandoning other curative measures and recommending excision, I doubt whether we could ever be sure of removing the whole diseased structure,—in other words, whether we could effect what I have stated as the paramount object of excision of a joint. It has been said that this resec- tion is analogous to the excision of the shoulder, where we seldom require to remove more than the head and tuberosities of the humerus. The two cases are essentially different in many respects—first, the disease in the shoulder-joint is very generally confined to the head and tuberosities of the humerus, very often commencing in the latter, or in the upper part of the bicipital groove ; whilst I cannot recollect of ever having seen a specimen of morbus coxarius where the acetabulum was not affected, and generally to a great extent. But, apart from the foregoing con- siderations, the great practical difference lies in this, that the scapula does not form a part of any of the great cavities of the body, so that we can remove, if necessary, not only the diseased surface of the glenoid cavity, or indeed that cavity entirely, by curved bone-forceps, but even a large portion of the scapula, or the whole bone ; wherea.s, in morbus coxarius, the acetabulum, if largely diseased, could not be so dealt with, as it forms a part of the walls of the pelvic cavity. In cases of advanced hip-joint disease, where the carious and dislocated head of the femur is felt bare through some sinus, or in the cavity of an abscess, I should consider it advisable to lay the sinus or abscess freely open, and resect and remove the carious portion of bone ; but I cannot see much likelihood of excision of the hip-joint (properly so called) becoming a successful operation. Excision of the Ankle-joint, for disease, is a comparatively rare operation : by proper care and treatment, when the disease occurs in young persons, and where it is limited to the joint, a cure by anchylosis can generally be effected. Persons above middle age are rarely the subjects of such disease, and if they were, excisions are not very successful at that period of life -p whilst, if any of the tarsal bones, except the upper articular

AMPUTATION. 852 charge. In the beginning of the fifth week the symptoms assumed a hectic character. As the patient was evidently fast sinking, and as her only chance of life was amputation, the limb was removed by the modified circular method, through the middle of the thigh. She died a fortnight after the operation. 4. John B. A loaded waggon passed obliquely over his right thigh, fractured the external malleolus and astragalus, and caused great extrava- sation into the textures of the leg and foot. At first it was thought pos- sible to save the limb, but by the following day it had become qiiite cold and perfectly numb. As it was impossible, under these circumstances, to amputate with safety below the knee, the operation was performed through the lower third of the thigh by the long anterior flap. Ee- covered. Remarks.â€”The successful case, John B., may be considered rather as a deferred, than, properly speaking, a secondary ampu- tation. The state of collapse in this patient rendered it doubtful whether the coldness of the injured limb might not depend upon the general depression of the circulation, rather than on the local lesions, and therefore I considered it prudent to wait until moderate reaction took place, before deciding as to the necessity for amputation.

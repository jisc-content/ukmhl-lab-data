932 INJURIES OF HEAD. the vital functions interrupted, be regarded as almost certainly fatal; yet, in tiie case of Sâ€”, we have an instance of such a lesion, with considerable displacement, terminating successfully. Judging from the train of symptoms observed, although the dis- placement and crepitus on movement left no doubt as to the nature of the injury, it nevertheless seems pretty clear, that the medulla spinalis must have escaped direct lesion ; for the com- plete paralysis and other symptoms, at first urgent, gradually passed off, so that after some hours all the formidable symptoms had disappeared, and in a few days the patient felt so little uneasiness or inconvenience, that it was difficult to make him believe the serious nature of his injury, or get him to keep quiet in bed, and avoid moving his head. It is probable, therefore, that the original urgent symptoms were due either to severe con- cussion of the cord, or perhaps to a certain amount of direct compression without laceration, the compression being relieved when the patient was placed in bed, with the head supported. For my own part, I incline to the former view, and for this, among other reasons, that there never seemed to be any apparent alteration of the displaced bones, the shortening and bulging for- ward of the front of the neck, and the irregular depression and prominence felt posteriorly, being as marked, after the bad symp- toms had passed off, as they were before. The interest of this case, however, does not terminate with the cure of the primary injury, for, contrary to my wish, he left the hospital on the twenty-fifth day after the accident, saying he felt quite well, and would be very careful of himself at home. I subsequently heard he had returned to his work ; and on the 11th of March he applied to be re-admitted, on account of gradually increasing paralysis, which had rather suddenly supervened a few days before. The quick pulse and febrile condition of the patient, together with the difficult respiration and the paralysis affecting parts deriving their nervous supply from above the original seat of injury, led me to infer that secondary changes, the result of irritation and inflammation of the cord and its membranes, were taking place, if, indeed, softening had not actually occurred, and

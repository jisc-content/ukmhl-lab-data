Fig. 17. of the accompanying woodcut, without straining or twisting. Finally, the cervical Wound is closed as fer as possible without giving rise to tension. The laxity of the skin in the cervical region allows this to be done to greater extent than we might expect, and the cervical wound heals by granulation. Various plastic operations are required to remedy partial destruction of the lips and cheek, resulting from cancrum oris, or other causes, but it is impossible to lay down rules for such irregular operations. The surgeon must plan the operation to suit each particular case. In planning such plastic operations, I would refer you to what I said when speaking of plastic opera- tions for removing deformities caused by burns. Harelip consists of a congenital gap through the substance of the upper lip, involving its whole thickness. It is sometimes associated with deficiency of texture, and always presents that appearance, owing to a wide gap being caused by the unopposed muscular contraction on either side of the fissure. This gap, or deficiency, not only exposes in an unseemly manner the teeth and gums, but so interferes with the proper functions of the lip as to render eating difficult, and proper articulation impossible. The expression of the face is necessarily very much altered by it, and the- discomfort and deformity are generally so great as to induce the parents to seek surgical aid at an early period.

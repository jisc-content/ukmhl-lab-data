OPERA TIONS. 700 an inverted A, instead of cutting it across as is often done. Of course all tendons and muscles, attached to and covering the capsular ligament of a joint, as in the shoulder, should be thoroughly divided by a bold incision, so as to enable us to disarticulate easily; and so must all muscles or tendons attached to parts of bone which are to be removed. In dealing with the diseased textures, all the affected synovial membrane present should be removed, by dissecting it off or by touching any small patches which are adherent with nitrate of silver, solution of chloride of zinc or perchloride of iron, or strong tincture of iodine. I generally use the chloride of zinc, and in cases of marked gelatinous degeneration I usually brush the surface of the wound with the solution when the resection is completed. In such cases, where we have diseased tissues, the chloride of zinc seems to produce a more healthy form of action, limit- ing suppuration and tending to more ra]3id consolidation of the parts. As regards the resection of the bones, all the arti- cular surface entering into the formation of the joint must be sawn off, not only to an extent suflBcient to remove the disease thoroughly, but when we wish to obtain a movable articulation by the formation of a false joint, we must re- move some healthy bone beyond, so as to prevent the risk of coalescence of the resected bones and anchylosis occurring during the progress of the cure. From what I have observed of excisions of the elbow, I think the full benefits of the excision are often lost in consequence of not removing a sufficient quan- tity of bone, from the dread of leaving a " flail-like joint," a very rare occurrence indeed. Again, the surgeon is liable to be misled as to the amount of the articular extremities of the bones he has removed, if the mere bulk is looked to, for the excited action has generally caused enlargement of the bones and deposition of new bone around. I make it a rule to judge of the extent to be removed by the anatomical marks of the bones ; thus, in the elbow I invariably saw through the condyloid portion of the humerus high up ; indeed, if that bone be sawn through its flattened portion immediately above the olecranon and coronoid

Excision of Shoulder-Joint: Steps of the Operation : After-treatment—Excision of Elbow-Joint by Longitudinal, H and T Incisions—Circumstances under which one or other should be preferred—Operation—Excision of Wrist-Joint —Instruments used and Operative Procedure. The general principles on which excision of joints should be performed having been considered, I shall now describe the methods of performing the principal excisions or resections, com- mencing with those of the upper extremity. Excision of the Shouldee-Joint has been very frequently performed in cases of disease of the head and tuberosities of the humerus, or for gunshot wound; and various lines of incision have been tried to effect this resection. Mr. White of Man- chester, who was amongst the first to propose this operation, used a single longitudinal incision through the central line of the deltoid. Others dissect up either a semilunar, or V- shaped flap of the deltoid, so as to expose the surface of the joint, open the capsular ligament, turn out the head of the humerus, and saw it off immediately below the tuberosities. The plan of operation, however, which I consider to be pre- ferable to all others, as enabling the surgeon to disarticulate with greatest ease and with least loss of blood, is a longitudinal in- cision made over the internal aspect of the joint, which enables the operator to expose the head and tuberosities of the humerus, where they are most prominent between the coracoid and acromion processes of the scapula, then by a slight rotation of the arm outwards, to expose and render tense the broad attachment of the subscapularis into the lesser tuberosity, and to divide this easily, which may be said to be the key of the operation. V Again, when in a dissection we reflect the deltoid muscle, it will be observed that the great posterior circumflex artery, which

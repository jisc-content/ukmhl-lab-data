RHINOPLA S TICS. 955 of the upper arm. After paring the edges of the nose and cheek, the flap was fitted and attached by sutures, the arm was supported by an apparatus specially arranged to suit the case, and retained in position for eight weeks before I could venture to sever the attachment of the flap. I was at first rather anxious as to union at the part attached to the margin of the recently-formed cheek, but everything went on favourably, and my patient's firmness was rewarded by a decided improvement in her appearance. I should, however, think very few persons will be found who would carry out the treatment or bear the irksome position of the arm with the determination she did.

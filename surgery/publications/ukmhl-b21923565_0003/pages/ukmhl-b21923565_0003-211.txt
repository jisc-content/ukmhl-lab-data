PIRIGOFF'S AMPUTATION. 813 this flap beyond the line of the joint, but not from the heel, he disarticulates, and next saws through tliat part of the os calcis behind the joint, then saws off the ends of the tibia and fibula, as in the other methods, and applies the section of the calca- neum, retained in the plantar flap, to the section of the tibia and fibula, so tliat the osseous surfaces may unite. From what I have seen of such modifications, I consider them as anything but improvements on either of the methods I have described ; because they retain portions of bone, which, in cases of caries, have a predisposition to become, if tliey be not already, affected by the disease, and because the stump left is by no means so well fitted to support the weight of the body, nor so well adapted for progression.

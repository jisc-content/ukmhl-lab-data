AMPUTATION AT THE Hir-JOINT. 819 Amputation at the Hip-Joint is undoubtedly one of the most formidable operations of surgery, and demands for its pro- per performance decision and rapidity in operating. The idea seems lately to have entered some minds, that the shock will be diminished if amputation through the trochanters be first per- formed, and then the head of the bone dissected out and disarti- culated. I can hardly conceive anything more likely to increase shock than a prolonged operation, or rather double operation ; and the difficulty of dissecting out the head and neck of the femur, after section through the trochanters, is very great. In one of my own cases, I was unwillingly obliged to disarticulate after this fashion, the shaft being separated at the trochanters by diseased action ; and I found it by no means an easy matter, as it is difficult by any artificial means to compensate for the loss of the leverage of the thigh-bone. Certainly, rapidity of execution does not seem to increase shock, for of my three successful cases—In one, disarticulation was performed in ten seconds ; in another, in fifteen seconds; and in the primary amputation, which was more complicated, it was effected in less than thirty seconds. I think the proposal I have alluded to must have arisen from confounding two things which are essen- tially different. It is quite true that in cases where amputation has been previously performed at the upper part of the leg or through the thigh, and in whichj at some subsequent period, return of the disease has necessitated amputation at the hip- joint, the risk and shock are very much diminished, and the reasons for this are obvious ; but that is a very different thing from performing first one and then a second operation at the same time, with a view to diminish shock. I have no hesitation in saying, that from my own experience, rapidity of execution in this operation is of great importance, as diminishing the risk from shock and loss of blood ; and in cases of tumours, where we have the leverage of the whole limb, the dis- articiilation may be accomplished in from ten to thirty seconds. The chief things to be attended to for its rapid (not hurried) per- formance are,—attention to the position of the patient; that

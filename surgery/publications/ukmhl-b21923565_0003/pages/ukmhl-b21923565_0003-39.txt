LECTURE LXXVL Ligature of the Middle and Third Portions of the Subclavian Artery—Ligature of the Axillary Artery in First, Second, and Third Portions—Ligatui-e of the Eadial Artery at Superior and Inferior Parts—Ligature of the Ulnar Artery. " On reaching tlie anterior scalenus, the subclavian artery passes behind that muscle, and is directly covered by it until it emerges from behind its outer margin to gain the first rib, on the surface of which it continues to rest until, after passing from off the rib, it receives the name of axillary. That portion which lies behind the scalenus is termed the middle portion of the subclavian, and is covered by the whole breadth of the anterior scalenus, and its course is crossed ob- liquely from above, downwards and inwards, by the phrenic nerve which rests upon the scalenus. The subclavian vein lies lower down towards the chest, resting on the anterior and inner part of the costal attachment of the scalenus, whilst more superficially this part of the vessel corresponds to the clavicular attachment of the sterno-mastoid muscle, platysma, and skin. In this part of its course the subclavian gives off two branches, or more generally a short common trunk dividing into two branches— the ascending deep cervical, and the subclavian intercostal. This middle portion, then, is very deeply seated ; its lower surface is in close relation to the pleura, whilst the phrenic nerve crosses its course in front. The third or outer part of the subclavian, commencing where the artery emerges from beneath the cover of the scalenus, is only covered by the skin, platysma, and superficial deep fasciee of the neck ; but still, owing to the arch formed by the clavicle, the vessel lies very deep. As this is the part of the subclavian which is most frequently the subject of surgical operation, we require to consider its relations very carefully.

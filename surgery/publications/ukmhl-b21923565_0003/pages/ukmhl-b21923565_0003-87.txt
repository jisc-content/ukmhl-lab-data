707 PARTIAL RESECTIONS. surface of the astragalus, be involved in the disease, I con- sider amputation at the ankle the more suitable measure. But, though I have had no personal experience in regard to excision of the ankle-joint for disease, I can conceive of some cases where it might be practised with advantage ; and from what I know of the ease with which the articular surfaces can be removed in compound dislocations of the ankle, without injury to the blood- vessels or tendons round the ankle-joint, I think that, in cases of disease proper for the operation, it might be readily accom- plished, without dividing any important structures, so as to leave a very useful limb, preserving the movements of the foot, so that I should be inclined to perform it if I met with a suitable case. In regard to partial resections of the foot for removal of diseased bones, except in the case of cario-necrosis of the os calcis, from what I have seen of such resections, and experience of my own cases, I have a very unfavourable opinion of such opera- tions. I have, in some cases, removed one of the cuneiform bones, and also the cuboid, with success ; but in most cases these operations are followed by mischief in the neighbouring tarsal articulations and bones, erysipelatous inflammation of the foot sets in, accompanied by irritative fever, and amputation of the foot, or, it may be, of the leg, is ultimately required, if the patient escapes the dangers of irritative fever or pysemia. I believe that such operations are attended with much greater risk to the patient's life than the results of even occasional successes warrant us to encounter, and hence I prefer non-interference in such cases, or merely gouging out the carious surface, without meddling with the articular surfaces ; or, when interference is im- perative, I consider either partial amputation of the foot, or at the ankle, the safer practiceâ€”the more so, that in such cases all the tarsal bones are generally predisposed to disease; so that, even in cases where partial excisions have been temporarily suc- cessful, the disease often returns in other portions of the tarsus, and amputation has at last to be resorted to. In these general remarks on excision of joints I have almost entirely re-

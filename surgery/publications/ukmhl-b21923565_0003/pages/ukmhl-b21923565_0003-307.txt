899 TREPAN IN PUNCTURED FRACTURE. this is effected without removing any sound bone, and with the least possible disturbance of the parts * In trephining, in cases of punctured fracture, in which our chief object is to remove the depressed points and detached frag- ments of the internal table, corresponding to the punctiire and radiating from it in all directions, I use a full-sized trephine, to permit of examination and easy extraction of the spicular por- tions of bone. To effect these objects, the puncture in the outer table of the skull should be the centre of the circle of bone to be removed. The objection to this, however, is, that to insert the centre pin of the trephine there would be very dangerous, but it is not necessary to use the centre pin. I take a piece of thin wood or moderately thick pasteboard or leather, and cut out a circular opening in it with the trephine I am about to use, and smooth the edges of the opening so made. I now place this over the part of the bone to be removed, the punctured wound of the bone being in the centre. The pasteboard is held firmly by an assistant until the trephine has made a sufficiently deep groove to work steadily in, and the section of the bone is then proceeded with as already described. In all cases of depressed fracture, but more especially in this form of injury, the trephine should be worked steadily and gently without jerking, as other- wise any unsteady movement might cause,the shelving portions of the internal table to impinge upon and puncture the dura mater and even the brain itself When the section is completed, the fragments—even the smallest—must be carefully picked out, and to make quite sure of removing all, without irritating too much the dura mater, I generally, after extracting the fragments that are visible, take a camel-hair pencil of large size slightly wetted, and introduce it under the margins of the bone, so as to sweep off any scales or debris of bone which may be lodged there. Finally, in this and all other forms of depressed fracture in which we operate, the state of the dura mater should be examined before closing the wound; and in all such cases the * See Clinical Cases.

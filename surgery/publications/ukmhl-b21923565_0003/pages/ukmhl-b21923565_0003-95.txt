CA USES OF DEA TH. 715 sufferings were in most of the cases intense. They were, in fact, cases which augured well for the result, and good specimens of a class of cases which I had indicated in some remarks on excision of the knee, in my Clinical Eeports 1858-9, as being specially suitable for the operation—viz. " cases where we find severe local disease of the joint, apparently limited, and of long standing, resisting all the usual remedies, and becoming exacer- bated whenever the patient tries to use the limb, but where, at ■ the same time, the general health has not suffered in any great degree." The causes of the issue in the fatal cases are deserving of attention. The result in the case of primary excision is scarcely to be wondered at. The man was above middle age, intemperate, and suffered various other injuries ; and it accords with my experience of primary amputations, that the presence of other lesions, although not even very dangerous in themselves, such as simple fracture of another limb, or slight injury of the head, have always a most marked influence in determining an unfavourable issue at a late period, and in an insidious form, as in the case alluded to, apparently depressing the vital power and inducing pysemia. I think the nature of the cases with which we have to deal in civil practice, as exemplified in the fatal cases of primary excision at the knee and elbow which I have recorded, serves to explain the difference from the great success in primary excisions in military practice for bullet- wounds ; but whilst we cannot consider such cases as mine as favourable for excision absolutely, I believe that their chances were at least as good as, I should say better than, after primary amputation in similar circumstances, and in less complicated cases decidedly preferable even as regards the risk to life. As to the cases in which the excision was performed for disease, the two in which the fatal result is least explicable, and where I certainly anticipated success from the conditions present, are the case of the man who died forty-eight hours after the opera- tion, apparently not rallying from the "shock." I have given the details, but as I confess I have never been able to satisfy my own mind as to the cause of death in his case, I shall not 3 B

The general conditions which most evidently determine the unfavourable issue areâ€”shock, loss of blood, gangrene of the stump, or pyaemia ; and, from my own experience, I would add the co-existence of other lesions, not in themselves very dangerous, and great comminution, especially longitudinally- fissured fracture of the bone or bones through which the amputation is performed ; and, lastly, certain moral causes reacting on and depressing the physical powers. Shock, or that peculiar effect of injury on the vital powers, mental and physical, with tendency to collapse, though difficult to define, is only too obvious in most cases of injury requiring amputation, to be overlooked as a condition unfavourable to the result, whether by depressing the vital powers so that reaction does not take place, or from the effects of over-reaction in a patient whose vital powers are for the time diminished. It may be accompanied and aggravated by htemorrhage ; but even without any loss of blood, the effects induced by the shock on the nervous system are always marked by extreme depression and * In an infant six weeks old, amputated in consequence of lisemorrliage from the tuniour.

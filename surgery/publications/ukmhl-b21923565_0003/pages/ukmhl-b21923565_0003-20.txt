648 OPERA TIONS. food, and not unfrequently from their previous habits, or from want of action in the wound. In private practice stimulation is not often needed, and I feel satisfied that the routine practice of giving stimulants in all cases of great operations is not only un- necessary but dangeroixs, as over-exciting the circulation, keeping up the pulse, and proving detrimental to internal organs. If the patient has a moderately firm pulse, and can take nutrient diet, the amount of wine or brandy he requires is very little, if any. Should the pulse keep high, or show a tendency to rise, the remedy of all others which I have found of most use as counter- acting this condition, and relieving the febrile state which accompanies it, is the tincture of aconite (Fleming's) in half-minim or minim doses, every three or four hours, watching its action carefully, and leaving off its use whenever the pulse lessens in fre- quency. During the after-progress of the case, when the tongue is clean, the use of quinine with compound infusion of gentian, and either dilute hydrochloric, nitric, or nitro-muriatic acid, will be found of use as tonics ; and in cases where there is any want of action in the stump, the exhibition of such tonics is often attended with marked benefit. In very weakly strumous patients, or where, from the nature of the disease reqmring the opera- tion, we dread pyaemia supervening, the muriated tincture of iron, and moderate doses of chlorate of potash, may be given; but should the iron produce nausea it must be abandoned. Of course the state of the bowels and the urinary secretion must be carefully attended to during the progress of the case ; and at first, shortly after the operation, the action of the bowels should be assisted by enemata to prevent straining; and, after ligature of great arteries, or in the larger amputations of the lower ex- tremity, the same precaution should be used at the period when the main ligatures may be expected to separate.

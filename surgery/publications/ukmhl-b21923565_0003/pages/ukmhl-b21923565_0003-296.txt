i LECTURE XCIV. Hernia Cerebri: its Nature, Causes, and Treatment—The Operation of Trepan : Instruments required for, and Mode of performing it ; how modified by the Nature of the Injury—General After-treatment—Brief Statement of the Cases where Trepan should be performed. Fungus, or Hernia Cerebri, is the term used to denote the fungoid protrusion which occasionally follows an aperture in the cranial vault, whether the opening has resulted from an opera- tion such as trepan, or removing loose portions of fractured bone, or has arisen from disease leading to death and exfoliation of the bone. If, as sometimes happens in the case of injuries, the dura mater or the brain itseK has been lacerated by the frac- tured bone, so soon as the bone is removed the pulsatory motion of the brain tends to project the brain substance through the lacerated membrane, and the aperture in the bone. In cases where the dura mater is entire, or merely punctured, the protru- sion occurs more slowly. The membrane is projected against the sharp edges of the trephine wound, or the irregular margins left after removal of some loose fragments of fractured bone. This gives rise to irritation, interrupted circulation, and at last slough- ing, of the dura mater, corresponding to the part whence the natural osseous support has been removed ; and then projection of the cerebral fungus gradually takes place. In some instances, as I have seen in gunshot fracture of the parietal bone, the dura mater, though not lacerated or wounded, has its vitality affected by the injury, and presents an opaque leathery appearance when the fragments of bone are removed; the sloughing, of the mem- brane takes place very rapidly, and a large though not very pro- minent fungus protrudes. (See Plate xlih. Pigs. 2 and 3.) I believe, however, that in most, if not in all cases of fungus cerebri, there are other causes in operation besides those men-

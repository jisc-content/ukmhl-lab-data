LECTURE LXXX. Comparative Mortality following Excision and Amputation in Upper and Lower Limbs, as seen from Statistics—Causes of the Mortality exemplified by Illustrative Cases—Instruments and Apparatus required for the Operation and After-treatment of Excision of Joints. The question of the comparative mortality in cases of excision of joints and of amputation can, I think, have reference only to these operations in the lower extremity. In the upper extremity a fatal issue after excision is very rare as com- pared with amputation. As regards my experience in my own practice, I find that out of 112 cases of excision of the elbow- joint I have lost only 6 cases. In 17 cases of excision at the shoulder-joint I have met with no fatal result; and in 8 cases of excision of the wrist I have met with no fatal case, but in two of these last, amputation of the forearm was required subse- quently. Of the 6 fatal cases of excision of the elbow, 2 died of acute pyaemia, 1 of pyaemia complicated with acute albuminuria. In one case, the patient, a young man, died of albuminuria five months after the operation. The symptoms began to develop themselves six weeks after the operation, and the wound of the operation was healed four weeks before death. The fifth fatal case resulted after the only primary excision which I have had an opportunity of performing, and the young man had sustained numerous injuries—namely, cerebral concussion and fracture of the ribs. He died the third day after admission into the hospital. In the sixth case—a very emaciated child with phosphaturia— the wound would not heal, amputation was performed, but he gradually sank exhausted. It seems to me that excisions of the upper limb are attended with less danger to life than any other operation of equal severity. In regard to these statistics of my experience in the

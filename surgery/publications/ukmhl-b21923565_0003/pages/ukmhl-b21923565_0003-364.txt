We have too little time to enter fully into the details of the numerous surgical diseases about the mouth. I shall therefore merely notice the more important points. The Lips are subject to various forms of ulceration, some simple, from mere local irritation, the effects of cold, or from disorder of the digestive organs. Such ulcers are generally of an aphthous character, and require little local treatment beyond pro- tecting them from exposure to fresh irritation. The constitutional treatment must depend on the predisposing cause. When speak- ing of syphilis, I stated that occasionally we meet with chancres of the lip, and mucous condylomata. These latter, when ulcerated on the surface, may lead to wrong diagnosis, as the local appear- ances very closely resemble those of certain forms of epithelial cancer of the lip, and therefore the surgeon requires to be cautious in his diagnosis, especially when the ulcer is present in young persons, in whom epithelial cancer is not common. In most instances the co-existence of eruptions, or the marks left by eruptions on the skin, and the state of the throat, will confirm his suspicions, if the ulcer be of a syphilitic character, and then the adoption of the treatment proper to that condition will speedily cure the local sore. The Cancroid and Cancerous Ulcer of the Lip is most fre- quently met with in the lower lip in old people, and the exciting cause is often traceable to long-continued local irritation, caused

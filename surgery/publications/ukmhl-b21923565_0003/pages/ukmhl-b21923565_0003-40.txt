664 OPERA TIONS. The external third of the subclavian artery is situated in what is termed anatomically the inferior external triangle of the neck, a space bounded internally by the outer margin of the sterno-mastoid, inferiorly by the clavicle, whilst the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid, passing obliquely upwards and forwards, forms the superior and outer boundary of the space. Super- ficially, the area of this triangular space is covered in by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia; whilst under the platysma we find the external jugular passing down to join the subclavian vein, and placed generally close to the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid, though not unfrequently it lies nearly over the middle of tlie space. Its position, however, can always be readily ascertained by pressure on the lower part of the neck, so as to make the vein distend. On dividing the deep fascia which binds down the omo-hyoid, we come upon a quantity of loose cellular tissue, containing numerous venous branches, such as the transversalis colli and others, running towards the subclavian vein. These venous branches generally coalesce to form a large trunk before joining the subclavian, and the large vein formed by their junction lies almost in front of, and in close apposition to, the subclavian artery. We have now arrived at the deeper plane of the triangle, on a level with tlie artery and the parts in immediate relation with it. The subclavian artery may be described at this level as situated in a deeper triangleâ€”the boundaries of which are, internally, the outer margin of the scalenus anticus ; externally, the scalenus posticus, the conver- gence of the scaleni forming the apex of the triangle, whilst the base and inferior boundary is formed by the first rib, on which the vessel rests. Contained within the limits of this deep triangle we find the nerves forming the brachial plexus superiorly, and inferiorly the subclavian artery. Crossing the area of the space near its apex is the transversalis colli or its branches, the posterior scapular and ascending cervical; lower down, the vein already mentioned, lying in front of the subclavian artery, pass- ing down to join the subclavian vein, which is situated lower down towards the chest, and barely resting on the tendon of the

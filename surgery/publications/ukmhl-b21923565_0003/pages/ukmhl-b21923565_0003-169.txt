781 GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. successful cases alluded to has the disease returned, though, several years have passed since the operations were performed. Amongst the miscellaneous cases of amputation, whilst some of them possess features of individual interest, they suggest but little in regard to general principles. I would merely notice the case of amputation for gangrene arising from diffuse popliteal aneurism, as one of those which, I think, unfairly swell the mortality of amputation statistics. So far as regarded the amputation, no case could have progressed more favourably, the stump had nearly healed, and the patient was sitting up in bed when he died in an instant from rupture of an aneurism of the aorta into the pericardium, a condition totally unconnected with the amputation. These general remarks on amputation have extended to greater length than I intended; but before concluding, I would, to prevent misapprehension, recapitulate, in the two following statements, some points which I wish you to keep in mind :â€” \st: In all ordinary cases the general rule holds good, that the smaller the amount of the body removed, the less will be the risk to life. But, in cases of primary amputation, where the bones are much comminuted or longitudinally fissured, I believe that amputation beyond the injured bone really diminishes the risk of pycemia ; and that in cases of malignant tumours of the shaft of a bone, amputation beyond the diseased bone is distinctly indicated, as it not only affords the greatest chance of immunity from the disease recurring, but actually diminishes the imme- diate risks. 2(1. That whilst, as a general method, I prefer a long and short flap, with a moderate amount of muscle, to form a covering for the bone, the muscular substance saved should never be great, as that adds to the risks of suppuration and pyaemia ; and the muscle should merely be preserved at that part of the flap cor- responding to the end of the bone. But in all cases of amputa- tion for injury or malignant disease, I consider that two equal

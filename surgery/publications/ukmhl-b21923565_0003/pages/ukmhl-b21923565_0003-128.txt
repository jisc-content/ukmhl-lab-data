OPERA TIONS. 742 only does the bone project in an extreme degree, but it terminates in a book-like process. This could scarcely result merely from the retraction of the other tissues. The practical deduction to which this leads us is, that in performing amputation on the young we should leave rather a redundancy of soft parts, so as to obviate the effects of the osseous development. These dissections, then, satisfied me, in the first place, that the muscular tissue preserved in stumps formed by the flap operation was useful in providing a thick layer or protecting pad, which did not disappear even after the lapse of many years; and, in the second place, that a certain degree of enlargement of the ends of the nerves in a stump was the inevitable conse- quence of their division, in whatever manner the operation was performed; the point to be attended to in regard to this being to cut them so high that they could not become involved in the cicatrix, or stretched over or adherent to the end of the bone, and to have them so deeply covered as to be less liable to be affected by atmospheric changes or external pressure. I was still further induced to give the preference to the flap operation by the condition in which I found those stumps that had been formed by the circular method. Nearly all of them that I examined were extremely conical, and had the bone adherent to the cicatrix, which latter was not unfrequently ulcerated; in the living subject, too, they were almost always excessively tender. At the same time, many of the stumps formed by the flap operation were very defective, and this was especially the case when the amputation had been performed according to the method of Vermale, by lateral flaps in the lower third of the thigh. In such a stump the bone projected towards, and generally adhered to, the cicatrix at the anterior point of transfixion, whilst the soft parts forming the flaps hung back from it. In many cases both of lateral and antero-posterior flap operation I found the soft parts so retracted as closely to resemble stumps formed by the circular method, and in several the bone projected the cicatrix, whUst in others the flaps seemed to have turned in upon themselves, leaving a deep cleft corresponding to

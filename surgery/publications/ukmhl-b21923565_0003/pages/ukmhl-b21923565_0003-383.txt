Diseases of the Jaws—Abscess of the Antrum of Higlimore : its Symptoms and Treatment—Abscess in Lower Jaw—Epulis—Cystic Tumours of Upper and Lower Jaws—Simple and Malignant Tumours of the Jaws—Excision of the Upper Jaw—Various Methods of performing the Operation—Excision of the Lower Jaw—Partial Resections—Disarticulation of the Lower Jaw—Excision of the Central Portion of the Lower' JaW. The upper and lower jaws are frequently the seat of diseased conditions which require oj)erative procedure for their cure. The forms of disease most frequently met with in the maxillary hones or their coverings are—ahscess of the antrum of Highniore in the upper jaw, or abscess in the body of the lower jawbone, with expansion of its structure; epulis, cystic and fibrous tumours, osteo-sarcoma and osteoma amongst the simple growths; and the different forms of medullary tumours, from those of fibroid or fibro-plastic structure to those of true cerebriform consistence, amongst the malignant growths. Tumours of the latter class are, unfortunately, much more common than the simple. Abscess of the Antrum is a very common affection, and, in genera], is easily diagnosed, although under some circumstances it .may simulate more serious disease of the upper jaw. The abscess is iisually the result of inflammation of the lining mem- brane of the cavity, caused by cold or the irritation from decayed teeth or stumps, and not unfrequently from the pivoting of artificial teeth leading to irritation. The symptoms are intense pain and tension felt in the part, the pain very similar to tooth- ache. There is considerable fever, then acute oedema of the cheek supervenes, and, on examining from the mouth, the mucous membrane is seen to be tense, and the anterior wall of the antrum is felt to bulge forwards, and has a peculiar elastic feeling to the touch.

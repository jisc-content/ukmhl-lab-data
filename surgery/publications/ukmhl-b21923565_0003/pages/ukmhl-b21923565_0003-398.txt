REGIONAL SURGERY. Fig. 28. 986 and indeed is, a comparatively easy operation. Biit, however performed, it is a very dangerous one, and the danger is pecu- , , liar; it consists of the risk of suffoca- tongue should he fastened to the inside of the lip or to a silver wire stretched between the teeth on each side of the section. In a case which I recorded in 1842, where I required to disarticulate the lower jaw of a woman, in whom the opposite side of the jaw had been previously removed, I determined to leave the sym- physis, to obviate the risk I have just mentioned; and, sup- ported as it was by the old cicatrix of the soft parts, it effectu- ally prevented it, and permitted a greater use of the incisor teeth than I had anticipated. (See Clinical Cases.) After operations for removal of portions of the lower jaw, the use of the simple apparatus first suggested to Mr. Listen by the late Mr. JSTasmyth of this city will be found of great service in preventing twisting of the remaining parts of the jaw. The ap- paratus consists of a case of caps fitted to the teeth of the upper and under jaw of the sound side. This is prepared before the operation, and then fitted on so as to retain the sound portion in position, and prevent twisting of the face. This apparatus is also useful in some cases of fracture of the jaw. tion from retraction of the os hyoides and tongue, when the attachments of the mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, and genio- hyoglossi muscles are divided from the bone. To avoid the immediate risk during the operation, we fix the tongue by means of a strong ligature passed through it near its tip, and held by an assistant. In most cases this suffi- ces, as the tendency to retraction gener- ally soon passes off We cannot, how- ever, trust to this, as fatal cases have occurred at a later period, and hence in in all cases the ligature through the

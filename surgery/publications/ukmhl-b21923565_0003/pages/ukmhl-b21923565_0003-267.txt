TREATMENT OF CONCUSSION. 8G3 blood when, from the shock to the nervous system, the circulation is depressed and irregular, and life trembling in the balance, would be very likely to turn the scale the wrong way. I know there are cases on record where venesection has been practised in the first stage of concussion with apparently immediate relief; and I can quite understand that in a case of concussion in which the right side of the heart was distended, venesection might, by reliev- ing the distended organ, benefit the patient; but the case would be marked by congestion of the veins of the neck. Besides, the risks are so evident and so great, that I think it safer to advise you to abstain from so dangerous a remedy. When reaction has fairly set in, absolute quietude must be enjoined, and prophylactic measures used to ward off over-excitement, and the effects which frequently follow concussion. Cold, by means of ice-bags or cold-water cloths, should be applied to the head, and hot bottles kept at the feet. The patient should be put on low diet, and the bowels kept freely open. Should the pulse become quick and hard, accompanied with headache, or very slow and laboured, with sluggish action of the iris, depletion should at once be em- ployed, either by venesection, or by leeches applied behind the ears. The patient should be carefully watched, and any abnormal conditions met by appropriate treatment.

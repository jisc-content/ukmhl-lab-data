CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 8i5 severe shock arising from the crushed arm, the dislocated hip, and the lacerated foot; the other, au old man, perished from the effects of the loss of a large quantity of blood previous to admis- sion. Secondary haemorrhage, which occurred in the amputation at the shoulder (No. II.), is by no means a common cause of death after primary amputations ; but as it has led to a fatal result in other cases of amputation at the shoulder-joint, it may be as well to examine into its probable causes in the case narrated. The artery had been tied well up from the margin of the flap, where all the tissues were apparently sound ; there seemed to have been no want of healthy action in the stump, as the greater part had united, and there did not seem to have been any great amount of suppuration even along the course of the vessel; yet the bleeding occurred at a very early period, and the vessel, little altered in appearance, seemed as if cut with a sharp instru- ment for about three-fourths of its circumference ; in short, divided by acute ulceration, presenting no appearance of internal clot or external plastic effusion. The nature of the injury, in this case, may probably account for the result, for the arterial tissue may have suffered from the dragging and twisting by the machinery, and thus had its vitality impaired to a much greater extent than would at first sight appear. When the injury necessitating amputation is direct, as a crush by machinery or the wheel of a carriage, the arterial tissue is not likely to be affected much beyond the parts injured; but when the limb has been dragged and twisted by machinery, as in this case, then, as I have said, the effect of the traction may have injured it much higher, and hence the more rapid ulceration caused by the ligature. I suspect, also, from what I was told, that the patient, feeling pretty well, had not been so quiet as was desirable, and he was being moved when the haemorrhage occurred.

878 INJURIES OF HEAD. must trust chiefly to the prophylactic measures recommended when treating of the effects of concussion; and to the active treatment of the early or acute stage of the inflammation which follows the contusion. In cases of chronic cranial ostitis follow- ing contusion, in which, from the attacks of headache and excite- ment, and the external 'tenderness of the scalp and bone, we sus- pect or ascertain that bone is the seat of inflammatory thicken- ing, depletion by leeches, or, better still, by incisions through the scalp over the affected bone, will be found to afford great relief and, if followed up by the use of a course of iodide of potas- sium, and, at a later period, by the application of repeated blisters, jiermanent benefit may be effected. In certain cases, where epileptic fits have followed contusion of the bone, and especially if there be marked tenderness on pressure, or a tendency to the fits being induced by such pressure, the operation of trephining the bone, with a view of removing the source of cerebral irrita- tion, has occasionally succeeded in effecting a cure; but it has frequently failed ; and, as the risk of a fatal issue is consider- able, I would not counsel you to have recourse to it except in severe cases, when the local irritation is well marked. Feactuke of the Cranium, even in its slightest form, is an injury attended with very great risk, because the existence of such a lesion indicates an amount of force applied to the cranium which would be likely to lead to serious results. It is well, however, to bear in mind, in reference to fractures of the cranial bones, that there is nothing peculiarly dangerous in the fracture itself, but that the danger is owing to the relation of the injured bone to the brain, and that this consideration is what influences our treatment of such injuries. Fractures of the cranium are classified according to their position or character. Thus, in reference to position, we have them divided into fractures of the cranial vault, and fractures of the base of the craniumâ€”an important classification practically, as the former division includes fractures of those portions of the skull which admit of direct surgical interference by operative

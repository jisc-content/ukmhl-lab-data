Excision of the Hip-Joint.—I have already expressed my objection to this operation, except in cases of advanced morbus coxarii;s, in which the parts are attenuated, and where the articular structures are disorganised, and the diseased head and neck of the femur are lying almost loose or partially lax in the cavity of an abscess, or are to be felt through openings from which pus has been discharged. In such cases, by freely laying open the sinuses over or along the posterior aspect of the great trochanter, and extending the incision upwards and downwards, and curving its extremities slightly forwards, or by converting the longitudinal into a crucial incision, by making a short trans- verse cut across it a little above the great trochanter, and dissecting the flaps from off the bone, the trochanter and upper part of the femur are exposed. The limb is then carried obliquely across the opposite one, so as to render the trochanter prominent. A bold firm sweep of the knife carried from the anterior to the posterior part of the trochanter upon its upper edge, and down- wards along the femur for two or three inches, separates the at- tachments of the gluteal muscles. When these are detached, the surgeon, by carrying the limb still more across the opposite one, and twisting it, will often be able at once to project and dislocate the diseased portion of the bone, so as to enable him to apply the saw and remove the trochanter and head and neck of the femur. If, however, the capsular ligament still exists, so as to require division, the operator should introduce his finger into

692 OPERA TIONS. The artery is next cleared from its vense comites and the nerve, the armed needle passed, and the vessel secured. In the middle of the leg the vessel is reached more easily, as the depth of the interosseous space has diminished, and also the bulk and depth of the muscles. The incision is similar to that in the operation just described—along the outer edge of the tibialis anticus; but here the surgeon must recollect that that muscle is narrower, and that the extensor of the great toe is the muscle in relation with the vessels externally. In other respects the steps of both operations are similar. The Posterior Tibial Artery is the direct continuation of the popliteal, and continues to descend a little to the internal side of the middle Line of the leg, resting upon the tibialis posticus and flexor communis muscles, which separate it from the pos- terior surface of the interosseous membrane, until it reaches the hollow or arch of the calcaneum, where it terminates in the internal and external plantar arteries. About eight or ten lines below its origin, the posterior tibial gives off a large artery, or, more properly speaking, subdivides into the posterior tibial proper and the peroneal or fibular artery. This latter is very often the larger of the two vessels ; in ordinary circum- stances the peroneal artery descends for about two and a half or three inches parallel to and on the same plane as the posterior tibial, but gradually gets covered by the mass of the long flexor of the great toe, and so passes out of sight, and ultimately ter- minates in anterior and posterior interosseous branches, com- municating both with the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and their malleolar branches. When the peroneal is the larger branch it takes the same course, but a little above the ankle it emerges from under the flexor of the great toe, and again joins the pos- terior tibial ; so that, however small that vessel may be in the upper part of the leg, it is always found of large size behind the inner ankle. The great posterior tibial nerve descends almost exactly in the middle line of the leg, so that it lies imme- diately external to the posterior tibial artery and its accom- panying veins, and internal to the peroneal artery—in other

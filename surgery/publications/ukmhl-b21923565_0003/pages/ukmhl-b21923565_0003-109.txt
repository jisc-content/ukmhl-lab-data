EXCISION OF WRIST. 121 extensor, and of that of the little finger, are then cleared from the inner part of the radius and groove on the back of the ulna, the edges of the inner incision being held apart to enable the surgeon to do so carefully. In clearing these last-mentioned tendons from the back of the carpus and metacarpus, I direct the assistant who has charge of the hand to bend it backwards to relax the tendons, and then insert my knife under the tendons, where I have cleared them above the wrist, turning the edge of the knife towards the bones, I cut downwards so as to clear the tendons and fibrous textures from the surface of the carpus and metacarpus to the required extent, without risk of division of the tendons. The next step in the operation is to separate the flexor tendons lying in front; and, from their com- paratively loose connections, this is readily accomplished by dissecting close in front of the radius and ulna at the outer and inner incisions, and then with the finger, aided by a few touches of the bistoury, the finger or handle of the knife can be passed between the tendons and the bones, whilst the hand is bent forwards to relax the textures. This having been effected, I pass a double fold of broad bandage between the bones and the soft parts on the back of the wrist, to draw them away and protect them during the section of the bones. I then introduce a straight grooved director (a large straight female lithotomy- staff answers the purpose) between the flexor tendons and the front of the radius and ulna ; along its groove the narrow saw is introduced, and the bones sawn through just above their styloid processes from before backwards, or, if more convenient, the director or a narrow metallic spatula being placed so as to protect the flexor tendons, the section of the bones may be proceeded with from behind forwards. The saw is next applied to the metacarpal bones of the fingers, immediately below their junction with the carpus. In some cases I clear the soft texture from the front of the bones, and then pass the narrow saw across the hand, its cutting edge directed to the metacarpus, and saw them through from before backwards. If an attempt be now made to dissect out the mass thus resected, it vfiW almost certainly fail, or

The Tonsils are subject to attacks of inflammation, wMcli may terminate in suppuration. There is great swelling in the throat, with difficvilty of breathing and swallowing, and much fever in proportion to the extent of the disease. The patient is often very much exhausted also, from want of food, and much depressed from the irritative fever which is present. All these symptoms may be relieved by making an opening early, if suppuration be suspected to be coming on, for the pus may form very deeply in the tonsil. In no case is there any danger in cutting into the tonsil; and an incision made to reach an abscess, even though the pus has not formed, can do no harm. It relieves the congestion of the parts, and in fact we often scarify the tonsil, just to modify the inflammatory action. We cannot of course feel fluctuation readily at an early stage of the disease in parts so deeply seated as the tonsil. A com- mon bistoury is the best instrument for gutting into the tonsil, and it should be passed directly backwards in the line of the second molar tooth, the edge being directed inwards, for it is important to remember the close proximity of the large vessels of the neck to the base of the tonsil. There is no danger, how- ever, to these parts, if the knife be passed fairly from before backwards into the abscess of the tonsil, and then carried upwards. The danger of non-interference in such a case is that the abscess may burst in the night, when the patient is asleep, and suffoca- tion occur. From the congested state of the parts, we may, and

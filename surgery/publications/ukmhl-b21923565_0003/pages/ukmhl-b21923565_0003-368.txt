REGIONAL SURGERY. 9G0 Fig. 18. Fig. ]9. The fissure may be single or double ; and it may be com- plete or partial in its extent. A complete fissure severs the whole lip, and extends up into the nostril (Fig. 18); a partial one divides the lip to a greater or less extent, in the same direction, without extending so far as the nostril. Whether there be one or two fissures, neither is ever situated in the middle line, but to one or other side of it; hence the term harelip does not accurately describe it. When there are two fissures, the groove below the columna of the nose is generally represented by an island or isthmus of sound skin, it being sometimes separate from, and sometimes continuous with, the septum of the noseâ€”generally the latter (Fig. 19). This is taken advantage of in operating, as I wUl afterwards show you. In addition to this, there is usually an irregularity in the alveolar process, corresponding to either or both notches in the lip. This deformity may assume the character of either a deficiency or redundancy, very frequently the latter. An inter-maxillary bone is frequently present, and projects at the fissure. Sometimes the alveolar process is divided, and a portion of it, with its corresponding tooth or teeth, turned curiously outwards, as if in adaptation to fill up the gap in the lip. The Operation for Harelip may be performed at almost any period of life ; but where you have a choice the preferable time is early infancy, or after the first dentition is complete, and the child two years old. As the lip, after being operated on, is apt to shrink upwards into a modified notch, marking the site of the original fissure, the great desideratum in connection with the operation is a lip free from this defect. With the view of effecting this, it

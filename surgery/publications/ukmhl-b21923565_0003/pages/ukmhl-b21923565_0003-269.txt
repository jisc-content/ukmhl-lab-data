INTRACRANIAL EXTRAVASATION. 865 and lead to syBiptoms, tlie character of wliicli will depend on the amount and site of the extravasated blood. If the extravasation be small in amount and situated in the brain substance, or on the surface of the brain, or in a thin layer within the arachnoid membrane, the symptoms at first may not be very urgent or marked, and any symptoms which have appeared may seem to pass off; yet the extravasated blood may, by exciting a chronic inflammatory action, lead to disease of the brain, and at a later period give rise to alteration in its functions, as evidenced by both objective and subjective symptoms, such as impaired vision, paralysis more or less complete of parts supplied by some of the intracranial nerves, loss of memory, or other mental disturbance, imbecility, or excitability. The cases in which the urgent symptoms following con- cussion mark most clearly the occurrence of intracranial extra- vasation, are those in which the meningeal vessels are ruptured. In such cases the force causing the injury has separated the dura mater from the cranial bones at the point where the blow was received, or at the opposite part of the cranium, by the contre-coup. The minute or larger vascular connections between the bone and membranes are ruptured, and pour out their contents. These press inwards the dura mater, and the corresponding hemisphere of the brain, caus- ing symptoms of compression. Such a case affords, of all others, the best example of compression; and following, as the symptoms do, upon those of concussion, the distinctive cha- racters and points of contrast between the two conditions are best studied. Suppose a case of concussion in which gradually the symptoms of Insensibility and collapse have passed off. Moderate

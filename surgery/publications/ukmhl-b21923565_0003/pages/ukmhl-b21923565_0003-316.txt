908 INJURIES OF SPINE. may occur without displacement of their bodies in consequence of direct injury. It has been proposed that in fracture or displacement of the vertebrce, giving rise to compression of the spinal cord, we should apply the trephine so as to remove the compressing cause ; but as Mr. Liston has well observed, " the spinal cord is generally displaced and compressed by the lower portion of the fractured body of the bones. One cannot easily comprehend what an operation is to effect in such cases." From my own observation of the state of the spinal marrow in fatal cases, I feel satisfied that in almost every instance the cord is not merely compressed, but its substance torn through or reduced to a pulp at the point of compres- sion ; and therefore, as its structure and functions are thus destroyed at the moment of the injury, removal of the compressing bone could not restore them. The only case in which the operation of trephining could possibly be of service, would be to elevate the broken fragments in a depressed fracture of the spinous processes and laminee of the vertebrte. But I would not expect much benefit from the operation, and would not recommend or perform it. The patient will have a better chance of recovery by the treatment already advised, than if we add a fresh lesion and source of irritation to the existing injury. Having now discussed the injuries of the scalp and cranium, it remains for me to speak very briefly of the diseases of that region. These areâ€”tumours of the scalp, or those arising from the cranial bones ; cirsoid aneurism of the vessels of the scalp; naevi, or vascular erectile tumours ; and cario-necrosis of the cranium. Tumours of the Scalp are generally of the benign class, and the different forms of encysted tumour are by far the most com- Fig. 7.

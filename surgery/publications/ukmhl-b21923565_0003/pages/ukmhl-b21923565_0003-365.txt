The characteristics of such ulcers are a warty and villous irregular surface, and extreme hardness of the base of the sore. They vary much as to extent, and the direction in which they extend. Thus, some are confined to a small space of the prola- bial surface, but the hardness involves the textures of the lip towards the chin, or angle of the mouth. Others extend very superficially along the length of the prolabium; or the surface and some depth of texture may be affected, whilst the skin and mucous membrane of the body of the lip may be unaffected. The Treatment is excision of the diseased part before the glands have become involved. There is no use in trying escharotics, as it will be found that even when the surface of the sore heals after destruction of the ulcer by such means, gland-tumours form in the submaxillary region, whilst their application is much more painful than the operation of excision. We must vary our pro- cedure according to the position, form, and extent of the disease. In the smaller and more defined cancroid ulcer of the lip we

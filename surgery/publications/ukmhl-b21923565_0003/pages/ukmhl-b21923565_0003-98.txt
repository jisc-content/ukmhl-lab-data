OPERA TIONS. 718 in some excisions, sucli as those at shoulder and hip; a saw with a movable back, and a blade eight inches long and three-quarters of an inch broad, the shifting back being so arranged that it is thrown off during sawing ; narrow saws of different lengths (Langenbeck's) which are useful in some resections, and are more efficient than the chain saw ; bone pliers of different sizes and forms ; gouge, and gouge forceps ; a pair Sir William Ferguson's lion forceps to grasp detached portions of bone, and give lever power ; a pair small necrosis forceps ; metallic spatulse to hold aside and protect the soft tissues during section of the bones ; artery forceps ; suture needles, and the other instruments needed in all operations. The apparatus for after-treatment consists of cushions or pads of lint, and different forms of splints, which are chiefly needed in special resections, and will be described when speaking of these. A small quantity of solution of chloride of zinc should be at hand to touch any parts of the diseased syno- vial membrane, which cannot be dissected off.

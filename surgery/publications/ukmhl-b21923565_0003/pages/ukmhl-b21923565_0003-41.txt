665 LIGA TURE OF SUBCLA VIAN. scalenus anticus, so as to leave a small space in which the costal attachment of the muscle is seen between the vein and artery. The supra-scapular artery and vein lie in close relation to the posterior surface of the clavicle. If we now consider the relation of parts in reference to guides to the third part of the subclavian, we find, first, that very generally the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid corresponds to the outer edge of the scalenus anticus, with sufficient accuracy to form a guide to the position of that muscle. Second, that the outer edge of the scalenus is in relation at its upper part with the nerves of the brachial plexus, and at its lower part with the subclavian artery which lies immediately behind it, close to its insertion into the first rib. That attachment of the scalenus anticus to the first rib is marked by a well-defined osseous promi- nence or tubercle. If we pass the finger from above downwards along the outer margin of the scalenus muscle to its attachment, we are guided to the tubercle on the first rib, and when the point of the finger touches the tubercle, the pulp of the finger must rest in contact with the subclavian artery, which lies in a shallow groove on the rib immediately behind and external to the tubercle. Thus we have a series of guides leading us from the surface to a fixed point in close relation to the artery, if it be in the normal position. The position aridjrelations of the middle and external portions of the subclavian arteries are remarkably constant, for although cases have been met with in which the artery ascended high in the neck, and then passed downwards and much further back than usual, or others in which the vessel perforated the anterior scalenus, and although there are also instances of the vein as well as the artery lying posterior to the scalenus anticus, or of the artery passing in front of the scalenus anticus, so as to be in close contact with the vein, yet such irregularities are very rare. In my own experience as an anatomist, out of many hundred bodies dissected in the practical rooms, where any abnormal dis- tributions of the blood-vessels were carefully watched for, I have

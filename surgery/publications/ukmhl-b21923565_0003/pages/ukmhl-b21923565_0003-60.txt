LECTUEE LXXVIII. Ligature of the Femoral Artery : in Lower Part of Scarpa's Triangle ; in Hunter's Canal—Anastomoses by which the Circulation is restored—Ligature of the Anterior Tibial Artery : of the Posterior Tibial Artery. From the point where the external iliac artery emerges from below Poupart's ligament into the region of the thigh, until it enters the popliteal space, by passing through the opening in the tendon of the adductor magnus, the vessel receives the name of femoral. The general course of the Femoeal Artery, if we include the commencement of the popliteal, is indicated by a prolonged and gently spiral line, which, in relation to the femur, descends from without inwards and backwards, then more directly down- wards, and lastly, outwards and backwards, winding round so as to gain the posterior aspect of the femur in the popliteal space. The common femoral artery, the direct continuation of the ex- ternal iliac, is always a very short trunk, not exceeding an inch and a half in length ; and, after passing from off the pubis, de- scends superficially, being merely covered by the integuments, superficial fascia, and the iliac portion of the fascia lata, and a variable quantity of fat and lymphatic glands lying on the fascia over the vessel In this part of its course the vessel rests upon the lower part of the psoas, having the mass of the iliacus muscle, which is here united with the psoas, in relation to its outer side. The anterior crural nerve is in this region deeply seated between the iliacus and psoas muscles, but soon becomes superficial, and lies about quarter of an inch, or rather more, to the outer side of the artery. The common femoral vein lies close to the inner side of the artery, and rests on the pectineus, a quantitj^ of cellular tissue intervening. The common femoral gives off superficial branches—the superficial epigastric, superficial circum- flex Oii, and superficial pudic. It then sends off the great pro-

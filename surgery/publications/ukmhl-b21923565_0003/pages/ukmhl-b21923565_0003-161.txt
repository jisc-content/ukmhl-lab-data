773 PYAEMIA. frequently met with, there than in private practice; but it is by no means confined to hospitals ; and from considerable experience and observation of this diseased state, I believe that its occurrence is much more determined by the state of the patient prior to an operation, or to depressing causes occurring afterwards, than is generally admitted; and that in cases of primary amputation, besides the more obvious depressing causes, certain forms of lesion specially conduce to its occurrence. Thus I have noticed that the risk of pytemia is always greatest in cases where the amputation has been performed through the continuity of the bone or bones which had been fractured. This is specially noticeable in primary amputation of the leg and upper arm, for railway and gunshot injuries. In these cases the fatality attending the operation is very great, whilst in cases where, from the severity and extent of the injury, we are forced to amputate beyond the injured bone at the shoulder-joint, or immediately above the knee, the success is greater. In cases of amputation at the shoulder, I am so satisfied of the diminished risk to the patient, that I feel relieved when the nature of the in- jury leaves no room for amputation through the injured humerus. In the fatal cases of primary amputation at the shoulder, the deaths were due to the effects of other injuries, and the great loss of blood in one case prior to the operation; but in my own practice I never saw a patient die from pyfemia after primary amputa- tion at the shoulder. As a general rule, the less of the limb removed, the less is the risk, but there are exceptions to all rules ; and in cases where a bone is much shattered, the risks of acute necrosis and osteo-myelitis attacking the bone of the stump, and so inducing pysemia, are so great as to warrant in many cases amputation at or above the neighbouring joint. The co-existence of other injuries not in themselves dangerous, such as simple fracture, or even contusions of other parts of the body, always exercise an unfavourable influence in cases of primary amputa- tion ; and, of course, when these injuries are more severe, the risk is greatly increased. In most cases of pyeemia the bone of

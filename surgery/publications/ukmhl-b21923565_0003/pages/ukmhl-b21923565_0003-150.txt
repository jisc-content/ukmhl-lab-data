OPERA TIONS. 762 of the greater amputatioBS which I have performed, and I shall now use it in trying to ascertain, or at least suggest, what are some of the causes influencing the results of amputation. My experience in performing amputation, though necessarily small in comparison with general statistics, is yet, I think, sufficiently large to entitle me to form some opinions on this subject; and I give them to you, along with some suggestions to assist you to elaborate the subject more fully with your own experience in practice hereafter. The following tables exclude all amputations of less magni- tude than those at the wrist and ankle joints. The first or general table gives the results of 403 amputations for all causes, and the information it affords is of the usual kind—namely, that out of a given number of cases of amputation so many recover and so many die. The subsequent tables show the results of the different amputations I have performed, under the heads of primary, secondary, and for disease, the last head being sub- divided so as to indicate the results of the operation in different diseases, and according to the situation of the disease. A glance at the results of amputations performed for different forms of disease will siiggest the object I have in view, to try to ascer- tain the probable causes of the greater mortality in certain cases, and how far these dangers are avoidable, or may be lessened.

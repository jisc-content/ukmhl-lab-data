737 EXCISION OF ANKLE-JOINT. about an incli above the malleoli. As the malleolar fragments have already been separated from their ligamentous attachments, a few touches with the point of the knife suffice to separate any remaining attachments, and the resected fragments are removed, either by the internal or external incision. As the soft parts are held apart, and the foot fixed, the upper portion of the astragalus comes into view, and the projecting articular portion is sawn off. Should there be any difficulty in doing this, the foot should be twisted, so as to project the astragalus laterally, to allow the section to be made with the narrow saw. All portions of diseased or injxired synovial structure should be removed, aU bleeding vessels twisted or otherwise secured, and points of suture introduced, and either closed at the time or left to be secured when all oozing has ceased. When there is much diseased synovial tissue, which cannot be dissected off, the surgeon should paint it over with a solution of chloride of zinc (1 part to 30). The limb is then placed on a light wire-splint, well padded and covered with gutta- percha tissue, secured and slung in the same manner as for compound fracture of the ankle, represented in Plate xvii. Fig. 13, only, instead of bandages, broad strips of adhesive or soap plaster may be advantageously used to secure the limb to the splint, and the use of ice-bags must depend on the circum- stances of each case.

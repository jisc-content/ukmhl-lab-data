832 AMPUTATION. strong fibrous periosteum investing the shaft on every side, and closed in at either extremity of tlie bone by the articular carti- lage of incrustation, the disease presented the utmost possible degree of anatomical limitation, and thus the best possible chance of complete removal. But to profit fully by this limita- tion of the disease, it was evidently necessary to amputate in the contiguity, and not through the continuity of the affected boneâ€”a rule which I consider of paramount importance in such cases. Hence the reason why I considered amputation through the trochanters inadmissible, although the bone seemed unaffected; for, in many cases where no perceptible alteration in the form of the bone can be detected, the disease will be found to be infil- trated into the cancellated texture, even of the neck and head of the bone; and there need be the less hesitation on this point, as I believe that, in cases of malignant tumours of the femur, am- putation through the trochanters is attended with quite as much danger to life as amputation at the hip-joint. I would here refer to the necessity which arose for applying a ligature to the femoral vein. The hsemorrhage from this vein continued after all pressure had been removed from the groin and abdomen, and as temporary pressure of its orifice, and other means, failed to arrest it, and as it returned whenever the pres- sure was removed, I found it absolutely necessary to tie it. I have frequently seen troublesome bleeding from the femoral vein in amputation of the thigh, but in general it stops when com- pression is made by applying the flap against the cut surface, when all pressure above is removed, and the stump elevated ; but here these means proved ineffectual, or, perhaps, I should rather say the weak condition of the patient rendered it necessary at once to check all loss of blood. I confess that my prejudices against tying veins are very strong, and this step in the opera- tion made me uneasy as to its effects ; but, as the history of the progress of the case shows, my fears were groundless, not a single bad symptom having followed ligature of the vein. In conclusion, the uninterrupted progress of the patient's recovery was most satisfactory. It is not often that even a

675 LIGATURE OF ULNAR ARTERY. the other vein to its outside. At the superior angle of the wound the nerve is separated from these vessels by a space which dimi- nishes towards the inferior angle, until they become in immediate contact. These vessels having been exposed, the artery must be insulated and tied. Ligature of the ulnar artery at the inferior part of the fore- arm becomes much easier. The two muscles, which, being in apposition superiorly, cover the artery and its accompanying veins, are in this region separated from each other for the space ~ of four or five lines, so that it is extremely easy to arrive at the artery. To accomplish this an incision of the skin must be made parallel to the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, but two or three lines external to it; the position of the pisiform bone, into which it is inserted, forms a sure guide to the tendon. Having divided the skin, the last-named tendon must be found, and the aponeu- rosis divided to the same extent as the incision of the skin. The opening having been made, the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, the nerve, and then the vessels, are exposed to view ; the artery is placed between its two veins, it is easily insulated, and its ligature accomplished.

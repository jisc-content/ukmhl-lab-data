903 CONCUSSION OF THE SPINE. From tlie anatomical arrangement of the spinal canal and its contents, the small size, form, and firmer consistence of the medulla spinalis, as compared with the brain, and from the arrangement of its membranes and vessels, especially the large size of the rachidian veins, it must, I think, be obvious, that if the medulla or its membranes suffer any direct lesion, its structure is likely to be implicated to a greater extent, and the bad effects produced are more likely to be permanent, or even progressive, than is the case in head injuries. Even injuries of the interspinous and other ligaments, may, from their close connection with the lining membrane, be followed by chronic affections of the spinal marrow. Concussion of the Spine may be caused in various ways, as by a person falling in the sitting posture, or backwards and striking the back against some projecting body, or by a person being suddenly and forcibly projected forwards, and then suffering from the violent recoil, as frequently happens in railway accidents. The symptoms produced will be more or less loss of motion, or sensation, or both, in the parts below the injured point. If the concussion be severe, and has affected the spine high up in the cervical region, life may be at once extinguished. More generally, however, the result is loss of power of the extremities and sphincter muscles, together with difficult respiration and priapism. If the case has been merely one of concussion, the symptoms after some hours begin to pass off and gradually disappear ; and if the patient be kept quiet, lying on the side or in the prone position, and cold applied to the spine by means of ice-bags when reaction sets in, no bad consequences may follow, if only the patient be very cautious for a length of time not to exert himself in any way. In other cases, if, after the original symptoms disappear, loss of nervous power again manifests itself, preceded by pain or uneasiness in the back, leeches should be at once applied, and the bleeding promoted by fomenting with sponges wrung out of hot water.

OPERA TIONS. 728 require a tedious and not very safe dissection ; but if the mass of the carpus and metacarpus be subdivided into smaller portions, each of these can be removed easily and safely. Ac- cordingly, after having sawn through the metacarpal bones of the fingers, I use the bone-pliers and cut the carpus upwards between the index-finger and thumb ; and again, in the same manner, in the line between ring and middle finger. I then seize the portions so marked out with a pair of strong forceps or hook to obtain leverage, and cautiously dissect the bones from the textures in front. The two internal portions having been removed, it merely remains to deal with the external third of the carpus. If the trapezium appears so far sound that I can leave it or its articulating surface with the thumb, I do so, as the usefulness of the hand is thereby much preserved. If not, then I snip off the articular end of the metacarpal bone, and remove that and the remaining portion of the carpus, and also the ends of the ulna and radius if not previously removed. I also leave the pisiform bone when not diseased, as the attach- ment of the ulnar flexor is thereby preserved. The resection being thus completed, the tourniquet is relaxed, and all bleed- ing points secured ; special care should be taken to secure small vessels deeply seated in the palmar region, as they may prove troublesome afterwards by distending the wound. I generally introduce the points of suture without closing them for some hours till all oozing has ceased. The hand and forearm are then placed on a splint so padded as to allow the hand to rest comfortably. Subsequently it is placed on a special splint fitted to the hand; the splint should be hinged at the wrist, so that after a time passive motion may be used. Of late, instead of bandaging the hand, I fix it with broad strips of adhesive plaster.

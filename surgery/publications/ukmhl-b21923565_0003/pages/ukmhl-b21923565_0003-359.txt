951 RHINOPLASTICS. woodcut (Fig. 11). The flap was taken from the forehead, and the columna afterwards formed from the upper lip ; the latter a mo- dification first used by Mr. Liston, and one of great importance in whatever method the nasal flap is formed. Albeit there was no chlo- roform in these days—the opera- tion, a tedious, and, I should think, a painful one—the applicants for improved appearance were numer- ous, for " pride feels no pain ;" and I well recollect on one occasion seeing three of these operations performed by Mr. Liston in one day, and two of the patients sit- ting with the nasal flaps hanging down, till the oozing ceased, whilst the third was undergoing the operation. But although I had the advantage of seeing the operations of a master-hand, I never was favourably impressed with the results; more especially as it always appeared to me that the peculiarlydis- agreeable expression, resulting from the cicatrisation of the large wound on the forehead, more than counterbalanced any improve- ment from the restoration of the nose. As years passed on, and I had opportunities of seeing many of the patients on whom these operations had been performed, this adverse opinion was confirmed, for the " renaissance," which had some appearance of a nose when first made, had almost in every case become " small by degrees," not " beautifully less "—in fact, degenerated into a sort of indefinite lump where a nose should be.

From this feeling,,! have never performed the rhinoplastic operation by that method, nor can I recommend it. But in cases where the

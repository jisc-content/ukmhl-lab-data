868 INJURIES OF HEAD. without apparent excitement of the pulse; but soon, as the escape of blood becomes more rapid from the restlessly excited state of the patient, sudden convulsions followed by complete compression result. In one fatal case, where the original injury was stated to be very slight, and where the patient could scarcely be made to see the necessity for any treatment, death occurred on the fifteenth day after the injury, preceded by excitement suddenly terminating in compression. On examination I found an enormous amount of blood effused, the greater portion of the mass being quite soft and evidently recent; whilst other portions, varjdng in consistence, showed that the extravasation had occurred at different times.* Connecting these post-mortem appearances with the train of symptoms observed in such cases, I have long considered the slow oppressed pulse and sluggish pupil, especially when preceded by fits of headache, and the sensation described by patients, as being like a "rushing sound or feeling" in the head, as indications for diminishing the force of the cerebral circulation, so as to prevent further extravasation. The means I use to ftdfil this indication are, depletion by means of leeches applied to the mastoid region ; venesection in severe cases, or where the patient is young and strong; cold applications to the head, and free purgation. In a great many cases, if leeches be applied to the mastoid region, when the pulse is first noticed becoming slow, after reaction has been established, they will be found sufficient, if combined with cold to the head and the use of purgatives; but if the symptoms threaten to reciir, the leeching should be repeated. In severe cases I have found most decided benefit from venesection, in alleviating the dull headache and tendency to coma, at the same time relieving the cerebral oppression, as evidenced by the slow, laboured pulse soon becoming more normal, and by the rapid improvement of all the other symp- toms. In young and robust persons I have repeated the bleed- ing with advantage ; but even in those of more advanced age or weaker constitution, it may be practised with perfect safety, if * See Clinical Cases.

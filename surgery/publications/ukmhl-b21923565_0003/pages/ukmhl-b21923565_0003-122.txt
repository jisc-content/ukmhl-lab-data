LECTURE LXXXIIL Amputation : Ends sought to be attained by it : Best Modes of fulfilling these— Anatomy of Stumps—Growth of Bone after Amputation—Advantages and Disadvantages of various Forms of Flaps, as advocated by Liston, Syme, and others. There are few operations which the surgeon is more frequently- called on to perform than Amputation, and none which require more consideration as to the best methods of operating, more care in the performance, and more attention in the after- treatment. Whilst, on the one hand, the term " Oppro- brium of Surgery," is singularly unsuitable as applied to an operation, which, by removing a disorganised or worse than useless part, so often snatches the patient from the very jaws of death, and restores him to health and comparative enjoyment; on the other hand, as it is an operation which necessarily entails mutilation, the surgeon is bound to use his utmost endeavours, not only to obviate the causes of danger to life, but also to avoid those conditions which are likely to interfere with the future comfort of the patient. He must not only remove the limb with safety to the patient, but he must also avoid the production of a painful or irritable stump. The formation of a good useful stump, effected with the least risk to life, being the object in view, the question to be decided is. What methods of operating enable us most surely and readily to attain it ? Having had a very considerable experience in performing amputations, and having, from an early period of my professional life, paid great attention to the subject, I trust the following remarks, founded on the results of my personal investigations and experience with regard to the different modes of operating, may be of some practical service. In deciding on the advantages or disadvantages of the differ-

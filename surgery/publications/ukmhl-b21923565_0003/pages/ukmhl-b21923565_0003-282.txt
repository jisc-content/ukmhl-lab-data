876 myURIES OF HEAD. 1 have, for the sake of description, taken typical cases of each ; but I stated at first, that we frequently meet with cases of severe concussion, in which the symptoms are not easily distinguished from those of compression. Thus, in some cases of concussion, the insensibility is very profound, and the pupils dilated, and the patient passes his stools and urine involuntarily. In other cases, we have the deep unconsciousness, together with convul- sions and strabismus. Such symptoms indicate pretty clearly that there is something more than mere cerebral shock; that there is either lesion of the brain substance, or that some extra- vasation has taken place at the time of the injury, and hence the mixture of symptoms of compression with those of concussion. In cases in which convulsions and strabismus are marked symp- toms, whether after concussion or fracture of the cranium, they indicate laceration of the brain substance, generally towards the centre or base of the organ, and the result is almost uniformly fatal.

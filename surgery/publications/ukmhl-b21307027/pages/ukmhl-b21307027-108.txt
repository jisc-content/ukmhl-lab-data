TURNERS ELEMENTS OF CHEMISTRY. Eighth Edition. Edited by Justus Liebig, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the University of Giessen, and William Gregory, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh. 1 vol. 8vo. \l. 10s. (See page 2.) Also, in Two Parts. Part I.—INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 15s. II.—ORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 15s. “ The present is, in short, the most complete and the most luminous system of Chemistry in the English language; and we know no one in France or Germany that comes near it.”—Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, Jan. 1, 1847. GREGORY'S OUTLINES OE CHEMISTRY, for the use of Students. By William Gregory, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the Uni- versity of Edinburgh. Second Edition, revised and enlarged. Complete in 1 vol. foolscap 8vo, 12s. cloth. Part I.—(Inorganic Chemistry), 5s. cloth. Part II.—(Organic Chemistry), 7s. cloth. “ This is beyond comparison the best introduction to Chemistry which has yet appeared. The directions for preparing substances are usually confined to the best method, so that brevity and selectness are combined. The size and price of this little work, as well as its intrinsic merits, commend it to every student of Chemistry.”—Lancet.

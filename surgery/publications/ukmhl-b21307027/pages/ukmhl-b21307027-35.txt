21 DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM. reality it may be traced upon the external surface of the levator ani muscle and the rectum, where, however, it is exceedingly thin and weak. Several openings exist in the triangular liga- ment, some of which serve for the passage of vessels, and others transmit the rectum and the membranous portion of the urethra. The opening which allows of the passage of the membranous portion of the urethra is situated nearly one inch below the The engraving represents the triangular ligament of the urethra where it fills up the arch of the pubis: the penis, and all the soft parts covering the bones, have been removed, as also the anterior lamina of the ligament, for the purpose of showing the situation of the glands of Cowper and the arteries of the bulb. In consequence of the rectum having been removed, the liga- ment presents the appearance of terminating inferiorly by a free border, which, in the natural condition of the parts, is not the case. The figures 1.1. mark Cowperâ€™s glands. 2. The posterior lamina of the triangular ligameut of the urethra. 3. 3. The tuberosities of the ischia. 4. The symphysis pubis. A little below this figure is observed a strong semicircular band of fibres, which is the sub-pubic ligament. 5.5. The dorsal arteries of the penis, or last branches of the internal pudic arteries. 6. 6. The arteries of the bulb. 7. The foramen or opening in the triangular ligament through which the membranous portion of the urethra passes.

INTRODUCTION OF THE CATHETER. 6G of the urethra. When this rotatory movement has been execut- ed, the handle of the catheter is to be depressed between the patient’s thighs, as in the ordinary method, so that its opposite extremity may follow the direction of the curve of the mem- branous and prostatic portion of the urethra. The chief diffi- culty in the execution of the Tour de Maitre consists in main- taining the point of the catheter perfectly steady during the rapid and sweeping movement of its handle, making it, as it were, the pivot or centre upon which the rest of the instrument revolves. The Tour de Maitre is most frequently employed when the staff is introduced after the patient has been bound in the position for the lateral operation of lithotomy. Introduction of a straight catheter.—When the patient is lying upon his back, which is the position for the operation of lithotrity in which straight instruments are most frequently em- ployed, the operator, holding the penis in the usual manner be- tween the fingers of the left hand, raises it until it forms a right angle with the trunk of the patient’s body ; he then introduces the instrument into the urethra, in a perpendicular direction, until its point reaches the sinus of the bulb, when he lowers the catheter and the penis together, and brings them down between the thighs of the patient until they are reduced into the hori- zontal position ; then, after first withdrawing the instrument about two or three lines in order to free its point from the sinus of the bulb, he pushes it gently onwards into the bladder, con- tinuing, if it is necessary, to depress still more the handle of the instrument, which will frequently facilitate the passage of the point along the membranous and prostatic portions of the canal. The natural obstacles which most frequently oppose them- selves to the passage of the catheter are, first, the lacunae of the urethra, and the sinus of the bulb ; after which comes the margin of the opening in the triangular ligament. When these are passed, the anterior border of the prostate gland, the orifices of its ducts, and the sinus pocularis, may all serve to obstruct the introduction of a small catheter, by entangling its point; and, lastly, the elevated ridge which marks the com- mencement of the neck of the bladder. It will be observed, that nearly all these natural obstacles to the easy introduction of a catheter are situated upon the inferior surface of the urethra,

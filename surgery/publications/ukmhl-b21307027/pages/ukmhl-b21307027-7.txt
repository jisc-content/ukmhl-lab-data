ADVERTISEMENT. The object of this work is to present the Student engaged in anatomical pursuits with a systematic plan, by which he may proceed in his dissections of the Perinseum ; and, at the same time, to induce him to connect the knowledge which he thus obtains of the anatomy of this region, with the study of the diseases occurring within its limits, and the surgical ope- rations which may be required for their relief. It is hoped, also, that the work may prove useful to those who, having quitted the schools, may still be desirous to keep up or renew their acquaintance with the anatomy of this important division of the human body. The lithographic plates, which serve to illustrate the work, have been engraved with great accuracy, after original draw- ings, carefully made from my own dissections. Of the wood engravings, the first is executed after a drawing made from the parts dissected; the second is copied from one of the plates in Sir Charles Bell’s "work on Operative Surgery; and the third is taken from an engraving in Scarpa’s memoir on the cutting gorget of Hawkins. I wish, also, to take this opportunity of acknowledging the assistance which I have derived, in the completion of this work, from a perusal of the valuable treatise on Surgical Anatomy, by M. Velpeau, the distinguished surgeon of the Hospital of La Charite at Paris. Thomas Morton. University College, 1st Oct. 1838.

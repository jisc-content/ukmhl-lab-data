THE INTERNAL PUDIC ARTERY. 53 pubis, the artery lies very deeply, being placed against the inner surface of the obturator internus muscle, the fleshy fibres of which separate it from the bone. Here the artery, with its ac- companying veins and nerve, arc inclosed in a dense sheath, which is formed by the splitting into two layers of the fibres of the obturator fascia. The artery when injected may be felt with the finerer about an inch above the lower edge of the tubero- sity of the ischium, where it is completely removed from the direction of the incisions which are made in the lateral operation of lithotomy, so that there is no chance of its being wounded in this part of its course. But when the artery has arrived op- posite the junction of the branches of the ischium and pubis, it approaches much nearer to the mesial line, and lies in the angle between the margin of the descending branch of the pubis and the triangular ligament of the urethra (as may be seen in the wood-cut at page 21), where it is in some degree overlaid by the crus penis. In this situation the artery has been frequently wounded during the operation of lithotomy, in consequence of the blade of the knife or gorget not having been directed suffi- ciently obliquely while making the section of the prostate gland and neck of the bladder ; for if the edge of the instrument is di- rected transversely outwards instead of being inclined obliquely downwards, it is difficult to conceive how the requisite opening can be made into the bladder without wounding the artery at this spot. When the internal pudic artery has been cut during the operation of lithotomy, and the haemorrhage that ensued was serious, the vessel has been secured lower down by means of a flexible curved needle introduced deeply into the ischio-rectal fossae, where it was carried round the vessel as it runs along the inner surface of the obturator internus muscle. Branches of ihe internal pudic artery. â€” In addition to the ramusculi which the internal pudic artery furnishes in the first and second parts of its course, it gives off several large and im- portant branches as it runs from the lesser sacro-sciatic notch to the under surface of the arch of the pubis; these arc as follows : 1. The arterice hcemorrhoidales externee are two or three in number, and spring from the trunk of the internal pudic artery as it is running along the external wall of the ischio-rcctal fossae; they pierce the obturator fascia immediately after their

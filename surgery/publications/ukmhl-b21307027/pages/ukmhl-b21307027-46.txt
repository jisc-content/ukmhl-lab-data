30 DISSECTION OF THE ORGANS OF THE PELVIS. of the scalpel. The pelvic fascia is a continuation of the same membranous structure which is called, where it lines the parictcs of the inguinal region, fascia transversalis, and upon the iliacus and psoas muscles, fascia iliaca: as it passes over the brim of the pelvis it is very thin and weak, and it is with great difficulty that it can be separated from the periosteum of the bones, to which it closely adheres. As the pelvic fascia descends behind the symphysis of the pubis, and upon the levator ani muscles, it becomes much stronger and is easily traced upon the sides of the bladder and rectum, upon which it is gradually expanded. The pelvic fascia is pierced by the several vessels and nerves which leave the cavity of the pelvis for the supply of the lower extremities and the genital organs ; each of these structures receives an investment or sheath from the fascia as they pass through it, which may be traced a short distance along their course. On each side of the symphysis pubis the pelvic fascia pre- sents two thick and strong processes, which extend from the bodies of the ossa pubis to the neck of the bladder, lying above the prostate gland. These processes are about an inch long, and have been named the anterior ligaments of the bladder; they connect some of the muscular fibres of the bladder to the posterior surface of the ossa pubis. Between the anterior ligaments of the bladder, the pelvic fascia presents a slight depression, which corresponds with the upper surface of the membranous portion of the urethra and prostate gland; underneath this depressed part of the pelvic fascia will be found the continuation of the dorsal veins of the penis, after they have passed through the triangular ligament to join the prostatic plexus. * When the pelvic fascia reaches tlSe neck of the bladder, it divides into two lamellae, of which the superior one is much the thinner, and ascends upon the muscular parietes of that organ, which it invests ; the othor end is much stronger and thicker, descends upon the prostate gland which it envelopes, as it were, in a perfect sheath, and may thence beâ€˜followed along the membranous portion of the urethra as, far as to the poste- rior margin of the opening by which that 'Canal passes through the triangular ligament, where it becomes continuous with the posterior layer of that structure.

DISSECTION OF THE PERIN7EUM. 2 which ought to be avoided, as they will interfere with the perfect display of the parts in the dissection which is about to be made. After the catheter has been introduced into the bladder, it should be allowed to remain there, while an examination of the prostate gland and the neck of the bladder is made from the rectum by means of the forefinger of the left hand introduced by the anus into that intestine. It will be found, as soon as the extremity of the finger has entered a little way within the anus, that the calibre of the rectum becomes suddenly very much enlarged; and this more particularly so in elderly subjects, and in those who have suffered in their lifetime from habitual constipation. When the palmar surface of the finger is directed against the anterior or upper wall of the bowel, that part of the catheter which rests in the membranous portion of the urethra will be readily distinguished, since the thickness of the structures that intervene between the finger and the catheter is very inconsiderable; at the same time, it will be readily conceived that the coats of the rectum are in very great danger of being cut in the lateral operation of lithotomy, unless the edge of the knife is carefully directed downwards and outwards, at the time when the membranous portion of the urethra is opened, previously to passing the knife along the groove of the staff into the bladder. Introducing the finger a little farther into the rectum, still keeping it applied against the anterior surface of the in- testine, the prostate gland will be perceived by its greater thickness, and by the sense of resistance which its firm and dense structure offers to the finger when it is compressed be- tween it and the catheter. By carrying the finger a little to the side of the mesial line, a much larger proportion of the prostate gland may be felt, which is owing to the greater size of its lateral lobes. Beyond the base of the prostate gland the catheter is again felt more distinctly through the thin coats of the base of the bladder; this is the spot that is selected by the surgeon for entering the trocar when he punctures the bladder from the rectum for the relief of cases of complete retention of urine, and in which the prostate gland is not much enlarged. In persons who are far advanced in years, the prostate gland

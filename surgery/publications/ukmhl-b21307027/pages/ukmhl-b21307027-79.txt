63 INTRODUCTION OF THE CATHETER. where it bends down in front of the scrotum. Holding the catheter in his right hand, lightly poised between the thumb and two first fingers, the surgeon introduces its point into the orifice of the urethra, and continues to pass the instrument onwards until the point reaches the bulb, which is about an inch below the arch of the pubes. During this time, the concavity of the catheter is directed towards the symphysis pubis, while the straight portion of it is held parallel with the front of the abdomen. The point of the catheter having reached the bulb, the position of its handle is now to be changed from the horizontal direction in which it has hitherto been held, until it has been brought into a perpendicular position, and thus forms a right angle with the axis of the patient’s body ; this movement of the handle of the catheter will cause its point to rise out of the sinus of the bulb, after which it may be safely pushed onwards through the open- ing in the triangular ligament of the urethra, and thus enter into the membranous portion of the canal. (See the annexed wood-cut, B and E.) By gradually depressing at this time the handle of the catheter a little more between the thighs of the patient, it will glide smoothly onwards through the remain- ing portion of the urethra into the bladder. The operation, as has been just described, may be divided into three periods, as follows:—In the first period, the point and curved part of the catheter are held in a perpendicular position while it is introduced along the urethra as far as the bulb, at the same time that its handle and straight portion are maintained in a horizontal position parallel with the anterior surface of the abdominal parietes : in the second period, the handle is raised from the horizontal into the vertical position; at the same time its point also rises a little, and is thus disengaged from the sinus of the bulb, and enters the membranous portion of the urethra, passing through the circular opening in the triangular ligament: in the third period, the handle of the instrument is still further depressed between the patient’s thighs, while the point con- tinues to ascend slightly, and, following the curve of the mem- branous and prostatic portions of the urethra behind the sym- physis pubis, enters the bladder. In this manner of introducing the catheter, it will be observed that the handle and point of the instrument describe each a curve at the same moment, the respective extent of which is

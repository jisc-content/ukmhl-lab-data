61 CHAPTER III. OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CATHETER. Among the number of those who are entering upon their studies in the schools, there are perhaps few to be found who are not ready to assert that they consider the introduction of the catheter as an operation of very trifling importance, and of such easy execution that they do not hesitate to undertake its performance with a perfect assurance of succeeding in their attempt: and although they are quite willing to admit that they are utterly unacquainted with the anatomy of the urethra, and the numerous structures by which it is surrounded, yet they possess, as they think, a sufficient ground for their opinion in the fact that they have already performed the operation many times without encountering any impediment. Nevertheless their success must be regarded as purely accidental, and un- worthy of the degree of confidence which is placed in it i and it would prove of much advantage if students could be early persuaded of the necessity that exists of diligently turning their attention to the examination of the structure and direction of the canal, along which they propose to introduce an instru- ment into the bladder. To a knowledge of the anatomy of the urethra should be added a frequent practice of the operation itself, and with this view every opportunity of introducing the catheter in the dead body ought to be taken advantage of; since by so doing the hand becomes accustomed to distinguish the different parts of the urethra, and the obstacles which they naturally oppose to the passage of the instrument; and thus are gained lightness of touch, and tact in adopting the best methods of avoiding these obstacles without doing an injury to the delicate lining membrane of the urethra, â€” acquirements which are of far more value and importance than all the information that can be de- rived from simply reading the descriptions of others. By so acting, any one, when he has to treat a case in which

Its acceptance as a standard it unavoidable ; for following closely in the straight path o f inductive Philosophy, the conclusions which are drawn from its data are incontrovertible. We can truly say, that wo have never risen from the perusal of a book with a more thorough conviction of the profound knowledge, extensive reading, and practical research of its author, and of the invincible power and importance of its reasonings and conclusions, than we have gained from the present volume.”—Silliman’t Journal.

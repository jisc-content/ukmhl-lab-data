32 DISSECTION OF THE ORGANS OF THE PELVIS. tissue of the pelvis, after the lateral operations of lithotomy; and hence the anxiety of many surgeons to avoid injuring it at this situation, while dividing the prostate gland with the knife or gorget. The incision or laceration of the prostate gland must extend beyond the base of the gland, and reach the base of the bladder, before infiltration of urine into the subserous cellular tissue of the pelvis can take place. The prostate gland is a firm fleshy body, placed in front of the neck of the bladder, which it embraces by its base or larger circumference. The figure of the prostate is heart-shaped, or, as is more commonly said, resembles that of a large chestnut; the base or broad part being directed posteriorly, whilst its apex, which is truncated, looks towards the arch of the pubis, from which it is distant about half an inch : here it surrounds the commencement of the membranous portion of the urethra. The prostate gland is somewhat flattened or compressed upon the superior and inferior surfaces, and is much more prominent on either side ; from which circumstance it is usual to describe it as consisting of two lobes,â€”the lateral lobes of the prostate, as they are called. In some subjects the posterior border of the prostate gland is more irregular in its outline than in others, and a small portion of its substance is found projecting between the vasa deferentia pre- vious to their entering the body of the gland: this has been described as another lobe, and is named the third or middle lobe of the prostate by Sir Everard Home, who first described it, and who considered that the retention of urine, which is so common in old men, was generally caused by a morbid growth of the third lobe ; an opinion, however, which is not universally adopted at the present day, since it has been frequently shown that the tumour which causes the retention of the urine alluded to, is a distinct growth, and wholly independent of this portion of the prostate. The prostate belongs to the class of conglomerate glands, as being composed of minute granules aggregated together by a very dense and strong tissue. Its ducts, which are very numerous, open into the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra, on each side of the verumontanum or caput gal/inaginis. It is by no means an unfrequent occurrence to meet with numbers of small calculi, of a dark brown colour, interspersed in the sub-

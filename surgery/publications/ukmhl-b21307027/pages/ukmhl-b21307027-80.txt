64 INTRODUCTION OF THE CATHETER. The engraving of the section of the pelvis represents the time when the handle of the catheter should be depressed in order to disengage its point from the sinus of the bulb. It is sometimes necessary to withdraw the catheter a few lines, and carry its point closer up along the superior surface of the urethra. Figure 1, is the bladder. 2. 2. The prostate gland : the vesicula semi- nales is seen behind the gland. 3. The rectum. 4. The cut surface of the symphysis pubis. A. The catheter introduced into the urethra as far as the bulb. B. The dotted line which indicates the direction in which the handle of the catheter is to be depressed in order to disengage the point from the depression of the bulb. E. The inferior margin of the opening in the trian- gular ligament of the urethra, and against which the point of the catheter frequently hitches. D. is another point at which the catheter is sometimes obstructed. very different : tliat is to say, the handle of the instrument de- scribes a segment, nearly one-half of a large circle, in the same time that the point travels more slowly over a segment of a circle of much smaller diameter.

Where it is in the power of the dissector to select a sub- ject, he will find it of considerable advantage to make choice of the body of a muscular adult who has died of some lingering disease; more particularly so when it is his intention to study with exactness the numerous and important vessels and fascim which are situated within the boundaries of this region. It is by no means an easy task to make even a tolerably satis- factory display of these structures when the subject is much loaded with fat. Previously to fixing the subject in the position which is best suited for the dissection of the perinseum, it is strongly re- commended that the introduction of the catheter both in the curved and straight forms should be practised, and the several inodes of effecting its introduction compared with one another; and also the most likely means of avoiding the natural obstacles which the many irregularities of the internal surface of the urethra and the structures that surround the canal are capable of presenting to the easy passage of the instrument. When the subject has been tied up in the usual position, with the thighs widely separated, it is frequently extremely difficult to introduce a catheter or staff without using a considerable degree of force, and running a great risk of lacerating the lining mem- brane of the urethra, and thus making a false passage ; accidents

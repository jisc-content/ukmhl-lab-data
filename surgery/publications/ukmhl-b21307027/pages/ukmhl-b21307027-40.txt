CHAPTER II. vSECTION I. DISSECTION TO EXPOSE, BY A LATERAL VIEW, THE ORGANS CONTAINED IN THE CAVITY OF THE PELVIS. An incision should be made, in the direction of the linea alba, from the upper part of the symphysis pubis to the umbili- cus, and another from the latter point to the spinous process of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The flap which has been thus marked out may be dissected from the peritonaeum, (which should remain intact,) and reflected downwards upon the thigh. As it is usual to perform the operation of lithotomy upon the left side, it need scarcely be said that these incisions should be also made upon the same side of the body. Detach now the peritonaeum from the iliac fossa, and expose the fascia which covers the iliacus interims and psoas magnus muscles ; trace this fascia over the brim of the pelvis as far as the neck of the bladder, and upon the rectum, where it becomes gradually weaker until it can hardly be distinguished from the subserous cellular tissue. Separate this, which is the pelvic fascia, and the fibres of the levator ani muscle, from their attachments to the left os innominatum, which may then be detached by sawing it across at a little distance from the symphysis pubis, and dividing the liffamento-cartilaarinous substance which forms the bond of union between it and the sacrum ; not forgetting to divide also the ilio-liunbar ligament. The bone, together with the obturator internus muscle, and the fascia that covers it, is to be removed altogether ; leaving, however, the spinous process of the ischium, with the fibres of the levator ani, which have their origin from it. While doing this, as much of the left crus penis and of the tri- angular ligament of the urethra is to be retained as is possible, by cutting the soft parts close to the branches of the os pubis and the ischium of the left side. In this stage of the dissection, besides the structures which have been already mentioned, some

3 DISSECTION OF THE PERIN7EUM. is not unfrcquently found to be much increased in size, and also to be almost surrounded, so to speak, by the rectum ; as the bowel, instead of lying simply underneath the gland, rises very considerably upon each side of it, and in such a manner as to invest it for two-thirds, and sometimes even more, of its circum- ference : this is a circumstance that is worthy of being borne in mind during the performance of the lateral operation of lithotomy upon aged individuals. It is by examining the prostate gland in this manner, with his finger introduced into the rectum, that the surgeon is en- abled to determine whether it is diseased or not ; and he is enabled by the same means to direct the point of the catheter with greater certainty in cases where the introduction of it has been rendered more than usually difficult by any injury or disease of the membranous and prostatic portions of the urethra. With the fingers introduced into the rectum, it is possible some- times to determine the weight and figure of a calculus more accurately than by any other means, and to facilitate the seizing of the stone by the forceps after the operation of lithotomy has been performed in cases where the calculus lies deeply behind the prostate gland in the bas-fond of the bladder. It is from the close connections that exist between the rectum and the membranous and prostatic portions of the urethra that the recto-vesical operation of ’lithotomy derives its simplicity and easy execution; though for other reasons, that will be noticed in another part of this work, it is an operation which has not been very favourably entertained by the pro- fession. Position of the subject. — When these preliminary steps have been taken, the catheter may be removed, and a full-sized staff introduced into the bladder; after which, the subject is to be fixed in the usual position as when the operation of lithotomy is about to be performed, which is done by bending the legs and thighs upon the trunk, and then tying the hands and feet together with bandages. The penis and scrotum are next to be tied up to the handle of the stafF, in such a manner as that they shall not obscure the view of the perinseum : the buttocks of the subject ought to be made to project a little be- yond the edge of the table upon which it lies ; and, if it should be considered to be necessary, they may be elevated a little d 2

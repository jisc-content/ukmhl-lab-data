46 DISSECTION OF THE ORGANS OF THE PELVIS. urethra is lined with a delicate mucous membrane, which is con- tinuous with that which lines the interior of the bladder ; it is naturally of a light colour, and presents, when the urethra is not artificially distended, numerous longitudinal folds or plicae. A number of small foramina are observable upon various parts of its surface, the greater part of which are placed along the inferior wall, and are also rather larger than the rest; they are the orifices of the little mucous crypts or lacunm of the urethra. These lacunae open very obliquely upon the surface of the urethra, and are directed from behind forwards; so that the urine, in its passage along the canal, passes over them with- out entering into their cavities. The mucous membrane of the urethra is easily torn ; but it is strengthened by a layer of con- densed cellular tissue, which is placed externally, and separates it from the other structures which surround the canal. In the prostatic portion of the urethra, the mucous membrane is addi- tionally supported by the firm structure of the prostate gland; in the membranous portion, by a layer of muscular and vascular tissue, and the sheath which it receives from the pelvic fascia. From the bulb to the external orifice, the erectile tissue of the corpus spongiosum surrounds it; though very little of this is found upon the upper part of the canal, except as it is passing through the glans. When the urethra does not open, as is usual, upon the ex- tremity of the glans penis, but upon some part of the under surface of the organ, the variety is called hypospadias ; this ab- normal state is much more frequent in its occurrence than that in which the urethra opens upon the dorsum of the penis, between the gland and the pubes, which deformity has received the appellation of epispadias. Before the bladder and urethra are removed, the levator ani muscle and the internal pudic artery should be examined as they lie within the pelvis, together with such of the branches of the internal iliac vessels as are connected with the urinary organs. To expose the inner surface of the levator ani, the bladder and rectum must be drawn downwards to the left side, and the pelvic fascia divided in the middle of the space between the point where it quits the side of the pelvis, and its reflection upon the sides of the bladder and rectum : by turning away on

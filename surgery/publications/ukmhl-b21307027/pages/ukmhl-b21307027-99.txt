Revised, with large Additions. 8vo. 15s. “Let him, though he know no characters hut those of his mother tongue, read through the book as well as he can, and we will answer that he will, at the close, find himself in the possession of much larger and clearer notions of general grammar, and especially of comparative etymology, than he would have supposed possible at the outset. He will find here an historical and analytical view, comprising the general ethnographical relations of the English Language, and that, too, in a much more readable form than he may imagine. At all events it will set him thinking, and, in whatever nook or comer of the kingdom or of the world his lot may be cast, observing too; for the very dialect of the province will acquire a new interest, and help him in his studies.” English Journal of Education.

57 THE UMBILICAL ARTERIES. THE UMBILICAL ARTERIES. The umbilical arteries form in the foetus the continuation of the trunks of the internal iliac arteries, and are during that period much larger than the external iliac arteries. These vessels serve to carry the blood from the body of the foetus back to the placenta, so that in their functions at least they more resemble veins than arteries. The umbilical arteries run along the sides of the bladder in a curved direction, the concavity of the curve being directed upwards; they extend from opposite the sacro-iliac symphysis to the umbilicus, where they emerge from the body of the foetus, and constitute a part of the umbili- cal cord, being coiled in a spiral manner round the umbilical vein. On reaching the placenta they terminate in numerous ramifications, which enter the substance of that structure. In their course within the pelvis, these vessels lie in the cellular tissue which covers the sides of the bladder; as they pass from the summit of the bladder to the umbilicus, they are placed be- tween the peritonaeum and the recti muscles, where they may be observed to form two prominent lines, one on each side of the urachus, when the cavity of the abdomen has been laid open by a transverse incision. After birth, that portion of the vessels which extends between the umbilicus and the sides of the bladder is gradually oblite- rated, and they assume the appearance of small but dense liga- mentous cords, which may tend in some degree to maintain the bladder in its natural position. Posteriorly a very small portion of the artery, now much reduced in its size, remains per- vious to the current of blood, which it distributes by several small branches to the inferior and lateral surfaces of the bladder. Thus the proportions that existed between the umbilical arteries and the external iliacs in the foetus become completely reversed in the adult.

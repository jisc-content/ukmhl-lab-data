DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM. 20 The skin of the penis is remarkably thin, and loosely adhe- rent to the subjacent fibrous structures, so that it readily ac- commodates itself to the varying states of the organ. Ante- riorly, the skin of the penis is continuous with the mucous mem- brane which is reflected from the base of the corona glandis upon its inner surface; the fold which is thus formed is named the prepuce, and the extent to which it covers the glans is very different in different individuals : there are some who cannot uncover the glans at all, which condition forms what has been named a congenital phymosis ; there are others, again, in whom the prepuce is so short that the glans is habitually un- covered, and between these two states innumerable varieties may occur. Thefreenum preeputii is the small duplicature of mucous membrane which retains the prepuce in its situation ; it is situated on the under surface of the glans. There is a small artery that runs in the substance of the frsenum ; this little vessel, when it has been divided in the operation for phymosis, should be either ligatured or cauterised, as large quantities of blood have been known to have been lost in consequence of a neglect of these precautions,* The cellular tissue which connects the skin of the prepuce to the mucous membrane is so extensible, that after an operation for phymosis, though every precaution possible may have been previously taken to make the section of the two surfaces of exactly equal extent, the edges of the incision become widely separated by the re- traction of the skin. Some surgeons recommend the use of the interrupted suture to bring the edges into contact with one an- other, while others prefer to cut away the whole of the mucous membrane that may yet remain undivided. The triangular ligament of the urethra, or deep fascia of the perinaeum, is a strong membranous structure which closes up the anterior part of the inferior outlet of the pelvis. It is attached on each side to the borders of the branches of the ischia and ossa pubis ; superiorly, it incloses between its layers the sub- pubic ligament, and is continuous with the periosteum which lines both surfaces of the symphysis pubis; inferiorly, this fascia has usually been considered as ceasing opposite the lower border of the transverse muscles of the perinseum, though in * I have known a patient lose as much as three pints of blood after an operation for phymosis, where this vessel had not been secured.

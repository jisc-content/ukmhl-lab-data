THE PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLES AND GENERAL LAWS OF THE SCIENCE. Foolscap 8vo, 5s. “The plan of the Letters is as simple and intelligible as their style. The author sets out with a general consideration of Chemistry; and of the rank to which it is entitled among the other sciences; treats shortly of chemical affinity and chemical equivalents, illustrating the symbols and formulte by which these affinities are expressed; explains the atomic theory; considers the relation of heat, light, electricity, and gravity to chemical force, and shows wherein these forces differ from what has been called the vital principle; and lastly discusses the transformations—fermentation, putrefaction, and decay—which take place in organic bodies when removed from the influence of vitality.’—Chambers’ Journal.

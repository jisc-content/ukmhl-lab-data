71 THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. This engraving represents the section of the left lobe of the prostate gland, which is made in the lateral operation of lithotomy. The parts have been dissected after having been separated from all their connexions, a. marks the incision, which, commencing in the membranous portion of the urethra, extends very near to the base or posterior edge of the left lobe of the pro- state gland, b. The left lobe of the prostate gland, b*. The right lobe of the gland. A slight projection in the posterior border of the gland marks the position and form of the third or middle lobe. c. The bulb of the urethra. Close behind are observed the two small granular masses named Cowperâ€™s glands, d. d. The crura of the penis, e. e. The vesiculaj semi- nales. /. /. The vasa deferentia. g. The ureter of the left side. There are three principal methods of cutting into the bladder for the purpose of extracting a calculus from its interior: viz. first, by an incision through the periuseum ; secondly, through the rectum; and thirdly, above the pubis. These various methods have been practised more or less extensively at different periods; though at the present day the two last-named are very seldom employed, and then only in consequence of some parti- cular circumstances. It is thus that the operation of lithotomy above the pubis is usually reserved for those cases in which the calculus is of too large a size to admit of being safely extracted

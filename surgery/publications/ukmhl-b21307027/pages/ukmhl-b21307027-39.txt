Between the vasa deferentia, a very small portion of the base or “ bas-fond” of the bladder is exposed to view, which is the point where the surgeon should enter his trocar, when performing the operation of puncturing the bladder from the rectum. This space will be observed to be ex- tremely small, so that considerable caution is requisite on the part of the operator to avoid injuring either the prostate gland which is in front, the peritonaeum which is behind, or the vesicular seminales and the vasa deferentia which lie on each side. In post-mortem examinations, the bladder, prostate gland, and greater part of the urethra may be removed from the body without causing any external disfigurement, and consequently without any violence to the feelings of the friends, who fre- quently object to the removal of valuable morbid specimens, only upon the ground of the unseemly appearance which might be given to the body of their deceased relative: the removal is effected by cutting out the diseased parts with a knife intro- duced into the rectum.

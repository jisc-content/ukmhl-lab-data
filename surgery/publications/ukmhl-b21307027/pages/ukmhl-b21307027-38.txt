DISSECTION OF THE PERIN/EUM. 24> tancc from the surface at which the base of the prostate gland usually lies, than can be acquired, perhaps, by any other means. b or this purpose, the triangular ligament must be divided by carrying an incision across from one tuberosity of the ischium to the other, passing between the bulb of the urethra and the rec- tum. In making this incision, Cowperâ€™s glands and the arteries of the bulb need not be injured. Those of the fibres of the levator ani muscle which descend upon the sides of the prostate gland and rectum must be also divided, in order that the lower part of the intestine may be depressed upon the coccyx. By a little dissection, the membranous portion of the urethra, and the mode in which it is nearly surrounded by the fibres of Wilson s muscles, when they exist, may be shown, as they lie m tl)e interval between the posterior surface of the triangular ligament and the apex of the prostate gland. Immediately be- hind these structures is the prostate gland itself, and the extent to which it may be safe to cut the left lobe of the gland in the lateral operation of lithotomy may now be determined; the in- cision in the adult can seldom exceed with safety an inch in length, and its direction should be obliquely downwards and out- wards, corresponding with the longest diameter of the gland. In making this dissection it will be observed how loosely the rectum is connected to the prostate gland and base of the blad- dei, a circumstance which will explain the frequent occurrence of those mistakes, mentioned by all writers upon lithotomy, in which the gorget or the forceps have been thrust repeatedly between the bladder and the rectum, and the patient allowed to die with a stone in his bladder that ought to have been extracted had the operation been properly performed. I have seen this happen once, in an operation which I witnessed while abroad; the mistake was discovered in time and corrected, after which the stone was extracted: the patient, who was a young boy, recovered very well. A little behind the base of the prostate gland are situated the vcsiculae seminales; and close along the inner sides of these will be found the vasa deferentia, as they descend upon the base of the bladder, in their course from the testicles to the point where they terminate in the prostatic portion of the urethra, rhey will be observed to converge towards each other as they approach the base of the prostate gland, where they are placed

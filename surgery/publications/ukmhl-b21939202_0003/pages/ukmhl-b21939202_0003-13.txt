•'5 You do not give facts in support of your opinion of the greater danger of chloroform ; but you give, what seems to me the true explanation of the cause of death under anes- thesia:— 'it is because the Patient was suddenly asphyxiated by an ignorant or inattentive administrator, who probably did not know what he was doing during the administration, and was watching the operator or the operation, instead of minding the pulse and respiration df the Patient.' Do you know any fatal case where the vapor was given by an inhaler which allowed a Patient to breathe fresh air ? In examining the published reports of fatal cases, — for 30 years or more, — I have only, as far as I remember, found one such case. It happened at M. Hospital in 1877. The Patient was an intemperate man of 27. In answer to my enquiry, Mr. S. sent me a full report, adding that he 'considered that fright, acting on a weak and fatty heart, had a good deal to say to the Patient's death; as he expressed a great dread of the operation before coming into the theatre at all.' The apparatus used in a fatal case is not always described. When mentioned, it is some kind of thing, — lint, towel, bag, — which does not allow respiration without the help of the administrator. This necessary help is not given by the < ignorant or inattentive administrator' whom you describe: and the death is set down to the chloroform, or ether, — not to the inhaler or the administration, both of which ought to be considered, before the vapor is acknowleged to be the cause of death, October 1889. STONE IN BLADDER. [M. M. C. 119.] In April, 1885, I saw the boy, whose case is mentioned. He continued in good health, without return of complaint. [M. M. C. 163,4.] In May, 1885, I was informed by the lady's son, that she continued in good health.

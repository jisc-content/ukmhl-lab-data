4 HYDROCELE. [M. M. C. 120,1]. The Patient, whose case is reported, died in December, 1889, at the age of 82 years, without return of the complaint. I saw him in 1883 ; cataract was then in progress in one eye. HYDROCELE. PARACENTESIS. A Medical Practitioner, 70 years of age, of rheumatic constitution, of active habits, and in good general health, observed a swelling of the right side of the scrotum, coming without known cause, and increasing for 12 or 15 months. Examination, in October 1886, by Mr. Sankey, Mr. Doyne and myself, left no doubt that it was a Hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis of the right testis.

After this third operation, the Patient went home in a carriage, in hope to avoid the inconvenience which followed the two former operations. But a similar train of symptoms followed, with a similar increase of size. In May, 1887, the Patient punctured the swelling himself, on rising in the morning. He estimates the quantity of fluid

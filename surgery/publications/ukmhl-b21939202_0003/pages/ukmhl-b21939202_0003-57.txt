47 not fail for want of funds under such receits. The large number of deaths is a melancholy fact. The cause of the deaths might be given in terms intelligible to English Sub- scribers. No explanation is given how it was that the 'debt of £260, brought over from last year,' (1891) was not paid out of the ' Cash at Bankers,' (£1,391) at the end of that year. The Lancashire Fund will soon disappear : for the Town Council of the City take charge of the cases of Fever, for which the Fund was given to the Infirmary. No notice appears in the Report of the Lichfield trust. 3 April, 1893. [M. M. C. 256.] To Sir H. A.—The only paper I have concerning the Infirmary is a printed copy of the case for Counsel in 1870. These notes I give from memory. In 1863 public attention was called to the want of accommodation for cases of Fever. The Mayor (Alderman T.) took an active part. Meetings were held, and a large sum of money was collected. This was paid to the Infirmary under the general belief that wards would be built for cases of Fever ; and that the Patients would be admitted without letters of recommendation. No written agreement was made, and no conditions were put into writing. The University gave £500, and the Radcliffe Trustees gave £500. Whether any conditions were attached to either of these gifts, I do not remember. In 1870 the Lancashire Fund (about £1,200,) was paid to the Infirmary under written conditions, — that so many beds, (6, I think,) should'be kept free for cases of Fever, — and the Patients to be admitted without letters of recommendation. The annual interest of this sum, if funded, would have given the right to recommend 26 In-Patients a-year. In March 1870 the Governors resolved to erect a building for Patients able to pay. Objections being made, the opinion of Counsel was taken; and an opinion was given against the proposed scheme. In 1876 the Governors refused to admit Patients with Fever, unless payment was made for them. Ladies

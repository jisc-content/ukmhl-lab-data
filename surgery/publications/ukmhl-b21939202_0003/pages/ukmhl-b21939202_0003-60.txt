50 borne in mind that the plan was altered after the work was begun; and that the walls of the ward were put upon foundations which were not meant for them. These things are all necessary and urgent. They will not take much from the funds. But, with other works,— equally urgent perhaps in the opinion of Governors taking part in the affairs,—they may call for some unexpected outlay; and ' where,' it has been said, ' are the funds to come from ?' They are to come, I answer, from where the funds of other Charitable Institutions have come. To this I add, what I told the Governors 40 years ago, — that there is not any instance of a General Hospital failing from want of funds. ' We have spent what we have had ; and we have made a good use of it,' — is all that the Governors of a Hospital need say. Funds will surely be provided. There is hardly room now for what is under- taken, the care of children under all forms of illness, and of the younger members of the University ; and the care of other persons, — whether 'objects of charity' or not,— under fevers of all kinds. The Founders never contem- plated these, when they built a house ' for the sick and infirm, being poor and real objects of charity'; and I say with confidence there is not space within the boundary- walls for the proper accommodation of such patients. 4 May, 1891.

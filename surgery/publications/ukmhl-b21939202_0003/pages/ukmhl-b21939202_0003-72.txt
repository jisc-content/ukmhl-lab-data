62 31 July, 1890. To the Same.—Notice of the death of J. R. A. was brought to me on Wednesday last, — without a statement of the nature of the injury for which he was admitted — or of the circumstances attending his death : nor was the name or residence given, of the persons who brought him to the Infirmary, nor other information by which I could obtain the particulars for registration of the death. The name of Mr. P. was given as ' Resident Medical Officer in attendance:' he did not attend the Inquest. By a letter from the Secretary, I understand it to be the intention of the Committee, that no information shall be given but what their subordinates think fit to give. I beg the favor of your informing the Medical Officers that, in future Inquests, — during the tenure of office by the present House-Surgeon, — it will be my duty to require the atten- dance of the Physician or Surgeon who had charge of the case, — and also of the Nurse or other person, present at the time of death. I regret much the necessity, under which it becomes my duty to depart from the advice given to the Committee by the Secretary of State, under which I have acted without a single exception, from the time that advice was given until now. 28 July, 1890. To the Rev. M. U. C. — Thanks for your letter, and for the trouble you have taken in writing. Your letter takes no notice of the fact that Mr. P. was in Oxford when the Committee had my letter of July 21 before them. You tell me nothing of any enquiry by the Committee into matters in that letter, — nor in others which I have at different times addressed to them : nor do I gather from your letter that there is any intention on the part of the Committee, to make their Servants give any help in the enquiry which I have to make. No suggestion has been made that there is anything unreasonable in what I ask, or any difficulty in giving it.

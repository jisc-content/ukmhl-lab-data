39 friends and neighbors, — not persons always ready to acknowlege what is constitutional as a cause of disease and death; and these, though slight, may help the Jury to form an opinion of the cause of death. In disease of the kidnies, — often obscure in the symptoms, — it will generally be found on enquiry that the Patient has been sometime under the care of a Medical Practitioner ; and that he, or his friends, have had warning of what may be the result of his symptoms. These are some of the causes of death, given in evidence before me by credible witnesses, — friends and neighbors of the deceased, — and found by the Jury to be from natural causes, — some of them, cases of sudden attack, or sudden death: — Disease of the heart, the lungs, the stomach, the kidnies, the brain; bronchitis, whooping cough, measles, spitting of blood, vomiting of blood, asthma, difficulty of breathing, cold and cough, consumption; inflammation of the lungs, the chest, the head ; fit of apoplexy, epilepsy, teething, convulsions, paralysis, giddiness, fainting ; dropsy, swelling of the legs ; diarrhea ; vomiting; constitutional weakness ; old age ; obstruction of the bowels ; exhaustion from pain in the chest, in the bowels, from continued, or excessive, drinking, from loss of blood from veins, from old ulcer, after over- exertion, after child-birth, after exposure to excessive cold, — to excessive heat. All, I think you will agree with me, 'sufficient' terms for the cause of death, — and intelligible. Excluding cases of death from violence and from acci- dental causes, and those from debauchery, and attributed directly or indirectly to excess in drink, there are some cases of death, — sudden and unexpected, — where the Jury have to find the cause of death, — or to name, (if they can,) the disease, or morbid state, without the help of scientific evidence. Most of them are from disease of some kind, — acute or chronic, — in the chest, . . the heart or lungs. Some few are from disease in the head, — the brain, or the blood-vessels supplying the brain and its coverings. In disease of the heart, death is immediate: the organ ceases to act, and life is at once at an end, — by 'syncope,'

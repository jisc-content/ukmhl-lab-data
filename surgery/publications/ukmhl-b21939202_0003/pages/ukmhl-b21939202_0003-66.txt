2 October, 1888. 5G home. As it was, I had to come back to Oxford on Tuesday for the purpose of holding the Inquest. The journey on that day, to and from Oxford, was caused by the neglect of the Officers of the Infirmary; and I am entitled to expect that the House should bear the expense. In March 1879, the Secretary of State, advised that the Officers of the Infirmary should readily conform to all legal requirements of the Coroner, and should render to him every assistance in the conduct of his Inquests; and in November 1883, the Committee, through their Secretary, expressed to me their intention of adhering to the direc- tions of the Secretary of State. 16 August, 1888. To the Same. — It is the duty of the Governors of the Infirmary to send me notice of the death of a Patient without unnecessary delay. It is also their duty to take care that the body is not opened without orders from me; and to see that all Officers of the House, who have knowlege of the circumstances, are in attendance to give evidence. The case of A. is the only case to which your letter refers. In that case, the names of Mr. S. and Mr. A. were given to me as the medical persons in attendance during life. It appeared at the Inquest, that neither of them was present when the body was opened for examina- tion ; and no one who was present at the examination attended to give evidence. 30 August, 1888. To the Same. — W. G. was admitted into the Infirmary, 21st September, and died, as I am informed, the same day, with symptoms of 1 Blood-poisoning.' A certificate of the cause of death, expressed partly in Latin and partly in Greek, was sent for registration. There was reasonable ground of suspicion that his death was owing to unnatural causes; and notice of the death ought to have been given to me.

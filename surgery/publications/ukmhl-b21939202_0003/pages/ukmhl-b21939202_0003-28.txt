18 the verdict was against the evidence, it is a case which happens sometimes, notwithstanding the care given by the Coroner. If an other verdict might have been found upon other evidence, you will do a public service by calling attention to the neglect of public duty in those who know of such evidence, and failed to bring it to the notice of the Coroner. It can not be too plainly brought to the knowlege of Prac- titioners that the purpose for which an Inquest is required is to find whether the death was from natural causes by visitation of God, or from unnatural causes at the hand of man; and that where an Inquest is required, it is an offence against the law to give a certificate for registration of the death. August 1892. — 'It is idle to hold Inquests,' said the President of the Society of Coroners, 1 when the information is withheld from us.' — To the Registrar General of Births, Deaths, &c. — On 30th June last, a Child named S., 4 years old, the Child of Parents living here, was taken with its Mother to B. When there, the Child was suddenly ill, and was seen at the Rail- way Station, — either dead or dying, — by Dr. C, who refused to certify. The body was brought home: a Certi- ficate was obtained from Mr. W. of Oxford, and sent to B. for registration. The Child is buried in Oxford. As the Coroner of Oxford, I venture to submit to you for enquiry, — why the Registrar registered a case of sudden death at B., — and upon whose information,— on the Certi- ficate of a Practitioner at Oxford, — whether the Certificate states that the Practitioner attended in the last illness, — and whether the case was referred to the Coroner. The Child was in its usual health, when taken from home. If not so, a question arises, whether the death was brought about by the journey to B. The case seems to be one in which, under the Coroners Act, it is compulsory to summon a Jury.

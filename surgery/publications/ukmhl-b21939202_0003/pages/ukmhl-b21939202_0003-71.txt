21 July, 1890. 01 that this was sufficient for the purpose of the Inquest. Let me remind them that the Law of the land has made the Coroner the judge of that. The question, — What particulars can be given ? — to make known the nature and extent of the injury, and the circumstances of the death, to persons who have not seen the Patient, and whose duty it is to make enquiry into the causes which may have brought about the death, would come properly, and in a more direct course, through the Medical Officers.

To the Same. — The arrangements proposed by the Resolution of the Committee, if acted upon honestly, as the wish of the Governors, will, I think, be found useful. Now and then it may happen that little or no inconvenience arises from delay; but in most cases it will be to the comfort of the friends, and to the convenience of all persons concerned, if the Coroner has notice, — with what- ever particulars are known, — as soon as can be after the death. In the case of A. F. W., who died on Thursday last, I received within two hours a letter from the House- Surgeon, telling me the hour of his death, without other information. When he was admitted, and for what com- plaint,— which of the Medical Officers had the charge of his case, — how he died and why, — the letter did not tell. I did not, — then or afterwards, — have from the Secretary, or other person, the printed paper with particulars, which has always been sent to me from the Infirmary until lately. I have been informed that, when the House- Surgeon gave his letter to the Porter, he told him not to give me any information about the case.

6 Observations de morbis Gallicis : I use the plural number, for there are many; and Hunter taught so. It was an early dream of my Master, Mr. Welbank, to have an opportunity to say something, — ad Clerum, — for Hunter, and for what he did on the subject. Late in life he lost the energy which would have held him to the work : he began to write, but he did not finish. He told me that he met Mr. Rose only once ; and that was in a case of the scaly form of disease, — the form steadily progressive, until mercury is administered, and invariably and rapidly superseded, and cured, under the exhibition of the mineral, — if properly administered, — without relapse, or re-appearance under any form (Med. Chir. Trans. XIII.). You do not mention Henry James Johnson. Mr. Welbank spoke of him favor- ably, and specially as a believer, — one of few, — in this form of Lues. If Hunter had lived, with the wish to give his opinions more fully, he might have added one more to the parts 'which we have not seen affected,' — the tongue. This I say on the authority of Mr. Welbank, to whom Mr. Abernethy communi- cated the opinion of Hunter, confirming it by his own observation; as Mr. Welbank did, in speaking to me. Mr. W. added that, if ever in doubt in a case, directly he saw the tongue affected, he was sure it was a case of what he called a ' mock disease.' When writing on these cases, I was in communication with Mr. Welbank ; and what I made public is written with his authority. 9 December, 1893. MEDIASTINAL TUMOR. In 1848, a laboring man from the country, about 35 years of age, was admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital under the care of Dr. Hue, complaining of pain in the chest, with shortness of breath, and general want of strength to follow his work as a gardener. The symptoms were not those of aneurism of any of the great vessels, nor was any important disease of the heart or lungs detected by auscultation.

70 brought to the knovvlege of the Committee by letters from me on 13th and 19th November 1883, and 9 September 1889. The Committee may be assured that sufficient notice shall be given, as heretofore. 13 September, 1892. To the Chairman of the Committee. — On Thursday last I held an Inquest on the body of T.

If the notice had been brought in proper time, the Inquest might have been held on Tuesday. The day of admission is stated in the notice to have been the 3rd (Friday). The witnesses at the Inquest said he was taken to the Infirmary on the 2nd (Thursday). The Nurse said it was by a mistake of hers, that the wrong day was named. I submit that it is the duty of the Officers of the House to see that the notice sent to me is correct in matters within their own knowlege. No ' Injury or disease' is mentioned in the notice; and the ' circum- stances of death' are given as ' fractured ribs,' leaving it open to question whether that injury was not received after the man was admitted. I am informed that permission was refused to my Officer to enter the House to see the Nurse for the purpose of obtaining the information which it is necessary I should have, that I may form an opinion what witnesses will be wanted at the Inquest. 13 February, 1893.

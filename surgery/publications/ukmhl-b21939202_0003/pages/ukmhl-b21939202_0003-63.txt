53 cases be given, with fuller particulars than those in the printed ticket sent to me. In the late case, the only description of the deceased was, ' Unknown, about 40,' — leaving it to be inferred that the sex of the Patient was unknown, as well as the name. Such information as this should be furnished; — When the Patient was admitted,— the time of death, and supposed cause : — if brought from a distance, the name and residence of the person who came with the Patient: — the Medical person by whose order the treatment was prescribed, — and which of the House-Surgeons, or Medical person acting as such, was in attendance; with some particulars of the case, which will readily suggest themselves to Medical Officers. I have also to request, — in cases where one of the Resident Officers has notice to attend, — that he may be in attendance at the time appointed^ that he may identify the body, when necessary ; and that the proceedings may not be delayed, while the Summoning Officer leaves the Court to fetch him. 19 November, 1883.

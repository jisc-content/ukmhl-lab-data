75 * * * A Brother Coroner, a Barrister, sending a copy of a Form of Order for moving a body, writes to me, — As in most cases I find it necessary to move bodies to the Mortuary, and as the friends and relations often object to such removal, I have had a Form printed, which I issue to my Officer whenever necessary. He is thus enabled to show an authority for the removal of the body, which generally prevents all opposition. This order I issue under the Public Health Act, 1875, Sect. 143, in regard to post-mortem examinations; and under the Common Law, and Sanitary Acts, as regards possession of the body by the Coroner, for the proper carrying out of his enquiry; and, as a Magistrate by virtue of his office, on Sanitary grounds. April 1893. The Lord Chancellor did not think it desirable to express an extra-judicial opinion on the point of law. But in his Lordship's opinion, the general rule should be, to leave the body where it is; — the removal only taking place on grounds rendering it proper, in relation to each particular case as it arises : — — Adding, further, in reference to letters which had been made public, that to enter upon controversial correspondence is not desirable in a Judicial Office. ■ 24 July, 1893. * * * * * * * # * Jfc * * *

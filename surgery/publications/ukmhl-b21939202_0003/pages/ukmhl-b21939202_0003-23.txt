13 THE COLLEGE OF SURGEONS. [M. M. C. II. 14.] To C. S. Esq. — The four questions in your letter are more easily answered on this paper, than on yours. The ' privileges' of those Members of the College who are Fellows have become so scanty, that they are hardly worth a thought. They can vote for Members of the Council: but they have ceased to elect them. I disapprove further degrada- tion of the Fellow's diploma. 1 The expenditure of the College-funds,' and all other affairs of the College, have always been ' controlled ' by Members of the College; and the business, I presume, is always done at a ' Meeting.' I know not what change is proposed. I disapprove of the attempt to deprive the Members of the College of this privilege : and I also disapprove the attempt to remove this, or any other business, to Members of any other College. A 'Member' of less than 'twenty years standing' can now be elected President or Councillor. I approve a change which will hinder a Member from being elected either President or Councillor, — unless he is a Fellow of the College, having received his diploma as Fellow before 1852, — or, if since, after examination only. I approve a change which will hinder a Member of the Council from being ' eligible for an Examinership,' unless he is a Fellow of the College, with a diploma as Fellow before 1852, — or, if since, after examination only. I also approve a change which will hinder any but Members of the Council from being Examiners: for I think that if a man ought not to be a Member of the Council, he ought not to be an Examiner. 22 April, 1889.

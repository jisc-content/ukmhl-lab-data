45 dying, in proportion to those received for treatment, — though less than in 1887, —is still large. The Report shows the continued receit of a large amount of money, — larger than is laid out on the yearly wants of the House. Like former Reports, it keeps out of sight the amount of cash in the hands of the Treasurer. The Lancashire fund is not named this year, — or in 1887, — among the Trusts, in the Statement of invested Capital. A debt of £202 is mentioned, — without showing to whom it is due, or for what; and no reason is given for its not having been paid from the Cash at Bankers, — £1,901 in 1887, and £716 in 1888. 15 April, 1889. To the Same. —Thanks for the Report, — for 1889. It must be satisfactory to the friends of the Institution to find that, — as in almost every year for the last 40 years, — the amount received in the year is larger than what is spent in the period. The accounts are printed in so many tables, in small type, and so complicated, that it is not easy to make out what is the case. Assuming the figures in the tables to be rightly given, it seems that £8,441 was received, while the payments were £7,115, — not taking note of a sum of £108, mentioned in a table not very clearly stated. The cash in the Treasurer's hands is not stated ; though £825 is said to be at the Bankers. The funded capital, which has been steadily increasing for the last 40 years, now stands at £62,000. The Report speaks of many improvements as being still wanted. Let me beg attention to the Dead-house. When first planned, it was not meant for permanent use : and it is not fit for the large number of bodies which are placed there. The Porter's lodge is close to it. I have heard that two Porters died within a short time of each other, under what is known as ' blood-poisoning.' Neither case was reported to me as Coroner; — though both ought to have been so reported. 28 April, 1890.

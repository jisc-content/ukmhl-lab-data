60 Coroner, — by force, if necessary, — from holding the Inquest, the Committee have not made public. 22 October, 1889. To the Chairman of the Committee. — Again I beg attention to the Notice sent to me of the death of a Patient, — A. T. Again I submit to the Committee, that I am entitled to expect that the Officers of the House should give a better description of the nature and extent of the injury, — and of the circumstances of death. I venture to point out for the consideration of the Members of the Committee that, when proper and full information is with- held, it leaves a doubt whether the Patient had that amount of attention, which should enable the Officers to give it ; and it creates a suspicion that there is something to be concealed. In the notice in this case, the Child is stated to have been admitted on the 15th inst. The fact is, the accident happened on the 16th; and the Child was admitted on the 18th. He died on the 23rd, at \ past 4, in the afternoon; and notice, of the death was not brought to me till after 10 o'clock on the 24th. The Secretary saw my Officer that morning at the Town Hall, before I had the notice; and he did not tell him of the Patient's death. 30 June, 1890. To the Same. — The absence of the Secretary, — suggested in his letter as the cause of delay, — did not hinder the persons in the House from sending notice of the Child's death, that day to the Parents. The messenger who took the notice might, at the same time, have brought notice to me, or to my Officer. What is wanted in case of a death is shown in the printed form of Notice: the Secretary has the Form, and he can supply it. In T.'s case, 5 words are given as the nature of the injury, and the circumstances of death. No kind of injury is described; and what is stated, — in 2 of the 5 words, — as being the circumstances of death, took place and had passed off, 2 days before the Child was admitted. The Committee give their opinion

46 To the Same. — Thanks for the copy of the Report, — presented by the Committee to the Governors. It tells no more than other Reports, of the sufficit. — The Subscribers to a Public Institution, expect a statement each year from those who take the management, showing in plain figures all that has been received, and all that has been spent. From the figures in the tables, — as well as I understand them, — it seems that a sum of £7,181 was received, and £7,325 spent: and that £712 remains as ' Cash at Bankers.' The Frewin money, — the annual interest of which is paid to the Physicians, — is shown in one of the tables. But there is not any mention of the Lichfield money, — of which about £200 is every year divided among the Physicians and Surgeons. In the tabular List of deaths, 31 are said to have been (in plain English) from want of breath, or want of blood. 24 March, 1891. To the same. — Thanks for the Report. The accounts are printed in the same confused mass of small figures of former years: and the sufficit, is not shown. The Frewin money, divided between the two Physicians, appears: but not the larger sum of Lichfield money, divided among all the Medical Officers. It is satisfactory that £8,261 was received, and only £7,530 spent. The funded Capital is £62,400 ; and the cash at the Bankers, £1,391. In giving the number of Patients during the year, it would be well to show how many were treated by the Physicians and Surgeons themselves; and how many by other persons, — the House-Surgeons, Pupils, and Nurses. The causes of death are not given with more exactness than in the last year or two; — 37 were from want of breath, 2 from mishap only. 31 March, 1892. To the same. —Thanks for the Report (of 1892). From the figures in the tables, it seems that the Receits were £8,976, and the Expenditure £7,589, with a good sufficit, £2,069, 'Cash at Bankers.' The Charitable Services will

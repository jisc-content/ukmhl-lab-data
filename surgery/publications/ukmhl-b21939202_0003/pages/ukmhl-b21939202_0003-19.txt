9 of Scarlatina again came out. The two Practitioners attended the child throughout the attack of Scarlatina, as they had done through the Small-pox. The child recovered favorably. British Medical Journal, November 1890. A BUTTON-HOOK IN THE INTESTINES. A case of a button-hook passing through the intestinal canal was under my care about twenty-eight years ago. A boy about 7 years of age, sitting at table in the nursery with his young brothers and sisters, was playing with an old button-hook. The wooden handle had long been broken off; only the iron part remained. The nursery maid told him to put it down. ' Sha'n't,' said the boy. Upon her going to take it from him, he put it into his mouth, hook foremost, and swallowed it at once. The mother reported the case to me, and asked what was to be done. I advised that all the motions passed by the boy should be examined, and that no purgative medicine of any kind should be given. Three or four days afterwards, I was told that the button-hook had been passed per anum without difficulty; and no further inconvenience was found. Lancet, January 1889. PHYSICIANS AND DOCTORS. [M. M. C. 404,5,6.] To DR. J. W. M., M.D., Dublin. —With this, I send a printed copy of a letter addressed by me several years ago to Dr. W.: neither he, nor any one else, has given an answer. My atten- tion has been recalled to the subject by your letter in the British Medical Journal. To you — as to every one who cares for the subject,— I submit that it is the rule of Society to call a Physician a 'Doctor,' and to address him as such, at all times, and on all occasions; and that it is a want of courtesy to do otherwise, in speaking, or in writing.

12 [M. M. C. 164.] Mr. J. F. CROOKES was of a Yorkshire family; and on the recommendation of an uncle, who was in practice at Barnsley, he was apprenticed to Sir William Lawrence, and served the minor offices of Dresser and House-Surgeon under him at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He was born in 1811; and he received a good classical and general education under private tuition, before entering on his proper professional studies. He was for some years one of the Surgeons to the Farringdon Dispensary; and discharged the duties honorably and efficiently, with attention and punctuality. A large and creditable field of work was then open to young and active members of the profession, affording opportunities for gain- ing skill and experience for themselves, and for occasional pupils, at a time when the Hospitals in London did not undertake the charge of Out-Patients. Mr. Crookes also acted generally as Sir William Lawrence's deputy in visiting prisoners at the Bridewell Hospital, to which Sir William was the Surgeon. Mr. Crookes's contributions to professional literature were confined to a single paper, referred by Sir W. Lawrence to the Medical Gazette, relating a case of tracheotomy, performed in the absence of Sir William Lawrence, upon one of the female prisoners, suddenly appearing in extremis, from laceration of the larynx and pharynx, while trying to swallow a sharp piece of a crust of bread ; and a case of restoration of the urethra in a woman, in one of the other Prisons. Mr. Crookes retired early from practice ; and soon after his marriage went to reside in Kent, among members of his wife's family, paying an occasional visit to his own relations in Yorkshire. He was a man of an active disposition, with a ready power of acquiring information, and he found for some years occupation in duty as an Officer of the Volunteer Artillery. He died at Folkestone, in August 1892, in his 82nd year.

It was his intention to rest at home, and to confine himself to the horizontal position ; and he adapted a well-fitting suspensory bandage as a support for the scrotum. While at breakfast, a messenger came, requesting his attendance at once at the house of a gentle- man living at a distance of 12 miles. It was a request he felt unable to refuse ; and he went, — taking what rest he could in the carriage, as he went, and came back.

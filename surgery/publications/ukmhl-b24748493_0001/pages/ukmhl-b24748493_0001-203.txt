192a SKIN DISEASES. narrow bony canals, along with small arteries ; these arteries contract in the initial rigor, but then dilate, and their abnormal size creates a pres- sure on the branches of the trigeminus and the sympathetic. The occasional result of the damage to the latter is the occurrence of a vesicular eruption on the skin. He thinks that when this has once oc- curred an accommodation takes place, in virtue of which a second attack of febrile dilation of the vessels does not irritate the vaso-motor fibres so as to cause the eruption. It is notorious, for instance, that in inter- mittent fever herpes only occurs once; as a rule, between the second and third cold fits. Here we are obliged to stop, our space being exhausted. We can only enumerate the following papers as the most important on skin diseases which have appeared : Virctaow, on molluscum contagiosum (' Virchow's Arch.,' xxxiii, i, p. 144). [Virchow regards the disease as a hyperplastic epithelioma, whose lobular glandlike structure is produced by over-formation in the epidermoid lining of the follicles. He inclines to agree with Bateman and Paterson, that the fat-like corpuscles which form the secretion of the epitheliomata are the vehicle of contagion.] Mosler, two cases of " hide-bound" skin ('Virchow's Arch.,' xxxiii, 3, p. 321, 1865). Fouquet, 011 urticaria tuberosa ('Berl. Klin. Woch.,' Aug. 7, 1865). [Fouquet has observed five cases of this rare dis- ease. It exclusively attacks women, and is intimately connected with the sexual func- tions, especially with pregnancy, lactation, &c] Purser, Dr. J. M., two cases of onychomycosis, with descriptions of the parasitic formations present ('Dub. Journ./ Nov. 1865). B. Wagner, case of parasitic disease of finger-nail3 ('Schmidt's Jahrb.,' 129, p. 178). Ripping, on cases of the same (ibid., p. 177). Betz, on the treatment of syphilitic paronychia. [Betz removes the nail, and" then firmly encases the whole finger, or toe, in stimulating plaster, and (in spite of the pain) does Dot remove this oftener than once a week.] Stark and Hallier, on the parasitic growths in favus and herpes ('Jen. Ztsch. f. M. u. Natw.,' 1865 ; ' Schmidt's Jahrb.,' 130, p. 27). Hebra, Ganeke, L. Landois, on phthiriasis [lousy disease] ('Wien. Med. Wochnsch.,' 17—19, 24, 25, 27—29, 1866). L. Landois, on the same ('Ztsch. f. Wiss. Zool.,' 1865). Hebra, on the same ('Wien. Med. Presse,' 31—36, 1865). Furneaux Jordan, on eczema of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea ('Lancet,' Jan. 21, 1865). [The author's object is to show that ophthalmia tarsi, granular lids, a peculiar swelling of the subintegumental connective tissue of the lids, lippitudo, strumous ophthalmia, certain forms of simple or catarrhal ophthalmia, keratititis and strumous keratititis, and certain ulcers in the cornea, are merely varieties of eczematous disease.] Hillier, on the lichen ruber of Hebra ('Lancet,' July 21, 1866). Milton, on the treatment of eczema (' Med. Times and Gaz.,' May 27, 1866). [Lowering means quite useless; arsenic only given in last stage; cod-liver oil is invaluable, and should be given for from three to six months; but iron is the best remedy, in the form of muriate.] Tilbury Fox and Purser, herpes circinnatus contracted from favus in the cat (' Med. Times and Gaz.,' Nov. 17, 1866). Balmanno Squire, psoriasis, in relation to pregnancy, lactation, and the puerperal state (' Med. Times and Gaz.,' July 7, 1866). McCall Anderson, on psoriasis and lepra (being part iii of ' Contributions to Dermatology.' Churchill, 1865, pp. 65). Eulenburg, on chronic pemphigus (' Berl. Klin. Woch.,' 34, 1865). Bergeron, on tinea tonsurans and favosa ('Ann. d'Hygiene,' Janv. 1865). Bryant, case of elephantiasis of the thigh and leg cured by ligature of external iliac (' Med'.-Chir. Trans.,' 1866), &c. &c. In concluding his task, the Editor of the foregoing " Eeporfc on Practical Medicine" begs to express his regret that certain circum- stances, over which he had no control, have prevented his making it what be could wish. The work was put into his hands verv late in the 12*

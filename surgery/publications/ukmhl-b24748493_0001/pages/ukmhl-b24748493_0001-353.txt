But the mortality after the operation is 3 per cent, greater than after amputation of the arm. The fifty-two preparations at the Army Medical Museum, illustrating this resection, indicate the fre- quency with which it is followed by secondary amputation or a fatal result. " Excision in the continuity of both bones of the forearm has a larger mortality than amputation of the forearm. " The specimens at the museum and the records afford emphatic argu- ments against formal excisions of the shaft of the femur. "With one exception, the few cases that recovered were those in which, after the removal of detached fragments, the least amount of operative inter- ference had been practised. " The mortality rate after excisions of the tibia and fibula is less than after amputation, as the statistics stand; but the number of cases in which the result is still pending is unusually large." .... " One of the registers of excisions is devoted to the cases of tre- phining after gunshot injuries of the cranium. The results are here recapitulated in a tabular form.

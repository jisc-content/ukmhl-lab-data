8 LYMPHATIC SYSTEM—ABSORPTION. Med. Vereinsch.,' Heft 3, p. 177), whilst admitting this, seems to regard them as essentially produced by a periodical increase and diminution of the capacity of imbibition of the protoplasm for water, which is occasioned by the varying dimensions of certain vacuolar that he has observed to be of constant occurrence in their interior. Mantegazza ('Gazetta Med. Ital.,' 1865) describes an instrument by which the number of red corpuscles in a cubic millimetre* of blood can be ascertained. He considers that in a healthy man the average number would be from 5,000,000 to 5,125,000; in a healthy woman, from 4,12 5,000 to 4,875,000 ; in extreme anremia, from 1,875,000 to 2,375,000 ; and in a plethoric woman the number was 5,500,000. Rosy or pallid cheeks, as abundance of other evidence shows, furnish no certain indica- tions of the relative amount of corpuscles present. Dr. P. L. Panum ('Virchow's Archiv,' Bd. 29, 1864, p. 481) found that the blood of newly born dogs contains a larger proportion of solids than that of the mother, the latter having in 1000 parts about 138 parts of solid residue, in the former proportions varying from 192 to 228 parts. An interesting observation on the pneumatology of the blood in disease has been made by MM. Estor and St. Pierre (' Memoires de la Societe de Biologie,' t. 1, ser. 4, p. 31, 1865), whohave shown that the venous blood returning from an inflamed part often contains twice as much oxygen as that on the sound side, and they attribute to this circumstance the brighter tint such parts possess. LYMPHATIC SYSTEM—ABSORPTION. As regards the origin and structure of the lymphatics, CKannuzzi ('Bericht. derKon Sachs. GesellschafbderWissenschaften,' 1865) describes the lymph-vessels in the submaxillary gland of the dog as commencing in fissures and splits of the connective tissue, of which the finest surround the acini of the gland. They open on the one hand under the connective tissue that bounds the acini, and on the other hand into spaces which surround the branches of the excretory ducts and the accompanying vessels and nerves. AVywodzoff ('Wien. Med. Jahrbiicher,' Bd. 11, 1, p. 3) found that the lymphatics of the lungs in the dog and horse originate as spaces in the parietes of the alveoli, destitute of proper walls. The lacuna? do not pursue the same course as the blood-capillaries, but frequently cross them. They first obtain a proper investment, viz., a tunica interna, on emerging from the alveolar walls, and the vessels are first supplied with valves after they have entirely left the pulmonary tissue. jST. Chrzonsczczewsky ('Virchow's Archiv,' Bd. 35, 1866 p. 174) maintains that the finer and more delicate lymphatics originate in the network formed by the anastomosing processes of the connective-tissue- celU. His ('Siebold und Kolliker's Zeitschrift f. Wiss. Zool.,' 15, 1865, p. 127; see also J. Dean in 'American Academy of Arts and Sciences,' 18^0) has particularly examined the somewhat irregular spaces or lurnina which are familiar to most microscopists as surrounding the blood-vessels of the nervous centres. He regards these perivascular spaces * A. millimetre is about l-25th of an inch.

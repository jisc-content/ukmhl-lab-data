1 REPORT ON T1IE PROGRESS OF PHYSIOLOGY AND THE ALLIED SCIENCES DURING THE YEARS 1865 AND 1866. BY HENRY POWER, E.R.C.S., M.B. Lond., XECTUBEK OX PHYSIOLOGY AT THE WESTMINSTER HOSPITAL. I>~ drawing up the following report upon the progress of physiology* histology, and histological chemistry, during the past two years, it will not be possible, in the limited space at disposal, to do more than notice some of the most important of the numerous papers that have been pub- lished in that time; and it is worthy of observation that, of these three sub- divisions of biology, histology, or the microscopical investigation of the tissues, has been most assiduously cultivated, and has received the greatest extension and development. The excellence and cheapness of the micro- scopes that can now be purchased both at home and abroad, the small amount of additional apparatus required for investigations of this nature, the abundance of material, the discovery of the remarkable preservative power of solutions of bichromate of potash and of chromic acid for even the most delicate nervous and glandular textures, enabling the observation of interesting subjects to be postponed to a convenient season, and the facilities which are afforded by the establishment of journals devoted ex- clusively to microscopical inquiries, for the publication of new and interest- ing facts, have all combined to open up this field of investigation in an hitherto unprecedented manner, which has certainly yielded, and will con- tinue to yield, fruitful results. Attention may here be briefly called to the introduction of the moist chamber by Recklinghausen, and of the arrangement proposed by Max. Schultze, by which the preparation under examination may be kept at any desired temperature (of which a descrip- tion will be found in the first volume of his ' Archives of Microscopical Science'), as being both valuable aids to microscopical investigation^ BLOOD. Commencing with the blood, as the natural and fitting introduction to the examination of the tissues which draw their nourishment from it,

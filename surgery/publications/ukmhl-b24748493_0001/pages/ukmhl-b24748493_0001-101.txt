From the subject of general paralysis of the insane there is a very uahiral transition to cases of cerebral sclerosis, with predominance of motor phenomena. Sclerosis affecting tlie Mental and the Motor Centres of the Nervous System. Dr. Urstphal* reports the history of 10 cases (and the post-mortem examination of 8 of them), in which the symptoms of advanced general paralysis were added to those of tabes dorsalis. In 7 of these cases mental disorder of an exalted type occurred at an early stage; in the other 3, on the contrary, the first mental symptom was intellectual feebleness, and this developed gradually into the deepest apathy, but in all the cases imbecility was finally developed. Of the 8 post-mortem examinations each revealed the existence of grey degeneration of the posterior columns of the cord ; but, oddly enough, Urstphal does not record the condition of the cortical substance of the brain in any. He seems to be of opinion that in some of these cases the disease was a true tabes dorsalis (not an original affection of the posterior columns of the cord), and secondary to the brain changes of general paralysis. Pathological anatomy has not yet afforded proof of the possibility of such an occurrence, though Joffe and Erlenmeyer have pronounced their opinion in favour of it; and it is remarkable that that most important symptom of tabes—the inability to keep the upright position with the eyes shut—is wholly wanting in general paralysis. Urstphal does not explain how it was that the mental symptoms in 7 of these cases were exactly those of common general paralysis. Professor "W. Zenkerf gives a remarkable case in which extensive sclerosis both of brain and spinal cord took place. The patient was a single woman, set. 30, whose father had been a drinker and died para- lysed. One of her brothers had already had an apoplectic attack, ghe had been healthy up to the commencement of this illness, which was 4 years before her coming under Zenker. At that time she was seized with violent spasms of the stomach, causing faintness and loss of con- * 'Allg. Ztsch. f. Psych.,' xxi, 361 ; 'Schmidt's Jahrb.,' 126, p. 117, 1865. t * Zeitsch. fur rat.

In neither had any vitreous been lost; in one, in which the inflammation did not commence till the 15th day, the hyaloid fossa bad not even been ruptured. It must be remarked that these statements give the power of vision that directly resulted from the operation, for in not a single case was a secondary operation required. In 7 of the cases the other eye had been lost after a previous cataract operation (3 by reclination, 4 by flap- extraction which had been followed by iritis).

173 DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. may occasionally exist without thrombosis, and often occurs without being followed by pya?mia. Pyaemia often exists without any evidence of phlebitis or thrombosis ; still oftener it occurs without any evidence that it has been preceded by either of these, or by any other affection of the veins. It has, therefore, not been satisfactorily shown that either phlebitis or thrombosis stands, in any especial or peculiar manner, in re- lation to pyremia, as cause and effect."

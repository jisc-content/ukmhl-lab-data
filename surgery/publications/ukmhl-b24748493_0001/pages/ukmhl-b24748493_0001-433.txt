F(KTUS AND NEW-BOItX INFANT. 421 Euptnre of a varix in the vagina. By Dr. Halfer ('Schmidt's Jabrb.,' 1S66).â€”Halfer's case was that of a multipara, who, during her preceding pregnacy, suffered from a large varix of the left leg. She was delivered naturally. Twenty-one days afterwards a gush of blood took place from the vagina. This recurred repeatedly, and caused death in five days. At the autopsy two rents were found on the pos- terior wall of the vagina leading to a burst varix; one extended under the pelvic fascia into a cavity filled with extravasated blood.

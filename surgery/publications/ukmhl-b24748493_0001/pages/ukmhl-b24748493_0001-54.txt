As it would be obviously impossible, with our limited space, to even glance at more than a few of the questions which have been raised by the cholera epidemics of 1865-6, it becomes necessary to make a selec- tion from the more important topics which have been discussed. Leaving to the department of public health the questions as to the material means of propagation, and the important discoveries in pro- phylaxis which have been made, we shall notice (1) some of the principal contributions to a settlement of the dispute as to the prevalence or non- prevalence of a regular stage of premonitory diarrhoea; (2) opinions as to pathology; and (3) the most important suggestions as to treatment. 1. Upon the question whether there is or is not, as a rule, a stage of premonitory diarrhoea, we shall take first the affirmative opinions. M. Guerin* has collected the statistics of the premonitory diarrhoea of cholera. He says that, in the epidemics of 1832, 1849, and .'853, experience has demonstrated the existence of a prodromic period, cha- racterised by diarrhoea, preceding the development of cholera from two to ten days. In London Dr. Burrows, in the report of the Council of Health, says that there was scarcely an exception in 500 cases. In the Hospital Val-de-Grace M/Levy found, in 142 cases, 95 in which there was premonitory diarrhoea, 41 in which the prodromata were gastric or ner- vous, and 6 only without prodromata. The Committee of Hygiene records 740 cases out of 974 as having premonitory symptoms; but complete information was not obtained'regarding all. In 1853-54 the Council of Health found on inquiry that of 5602 cases 4983 presented premoni- tory diarrhoea. The prevalence of premonitory diarrhoea has also been confirmed by M. Melier. Dr. Pantaleonif gives the results of his observations made during an epidemic of cholera at Borne in 1837, in which 10,000 persons perished in two months. Of 112 cases of well-marked cholera which came under his care (of whom 39 died), the cholera was preceded by diarrhoea in 106. The diarrhoea was sometimes of only 6 hours' duration, or even less ; but generally it lasted from 24 to 48 hours, or even several days. It was unaccompanied with colic or tenderness of the abdomen; but there were always anxiety and restlessness, which caused the attendants on the patients to imagine that they had pain. He says that he never had in his practice a case of the cerebral, nervous, typhoid, ill-defined fever which has been frequently observed to accompany or follow the stage of reaction. Where it was present in the patients of other phy- sicians large doses of opium and stimulants had been given during the algide period; but he does not attribute all the cases of cerebral fever to the administration of these drugs. He protests, however, against increasing the quantity of medicine in the algide stage, as it is not ab- sorbed, but accumulates, and, when reaction sets in, may act as a poison.

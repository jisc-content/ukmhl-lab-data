Of the other 225 cases, the hydrocele was on the right side in 107 and on the left in 118. "We can only notice very cursorily a few of the more striking points in the rest of Sig. Melchiorj's treatise. In the complete testi-funicular form (No. 4) he gives an instance of its having sent a prolongation up into the iliac fossa (as a " secondary " change from the primitive form), and alludes to an instance in which fatal peritonitis followed on the injection of this form of hydrocele. As to the scrotal testi-funicular (No. 5), he calls attention to its occasional large size, extending even to the pubes and penis, and to its frequent division into 2 parts (" hydrocele en bissac "). He says that, in examin- ing the bodies of 60 individuals from 45 to 80 years of age, he found in 4 a state of the tunica vaginalis which would admit of the complete testi-funicular form, and in 5 of the scrotal testi-funicular hydrocele. "With respect to testicular (common) hydrocele (No. 6), he gives an instance of the partial obliteration of the common cavity which may take place from the injuries by which this disease is occasionally caused. Cystic hydroceles of the cord form his next 3 divisions, and he shows that in rare cases more than one of these cysts may exist in the same cord. On p. 266 he lays down rules for diagnosing those cysts which are the unobliterated remains of the foetal process of peritoneum from those which are formed in obstructed hernial sacs or in the areola? of the cellular tissue. The complete funicular hydro- cele (No. 7) may, as he notices, extend so low down as to cover the testicle and (perhaps in the same subject) so high up as to project into the belly, where it ends in a rounded projection. Of this hydrocele and of the scrotal funicular, he distinguishes 3 grades as they proceed downwards in the scrotum, which is their natural pro- gress (peri-testicular), viz.—1. The testicle is covered only in front; and

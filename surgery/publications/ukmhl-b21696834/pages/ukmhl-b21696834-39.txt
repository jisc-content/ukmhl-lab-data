37 V.—Ovariotomy. By Dr Bennett and Dr Handyside. (From, the Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal, No. 167.) History of the Case previous to the operation. By Dr Bennett. Jessie Fleming, unmarried, aged 20, residing in Crail, was admitted into the Royal Infirmary under Dr Bennett, July 5, 1845, recommended by Mr Crabbe, Surgeon. She states, that eighteen months ago she first perceived a tu- mour in the lower part of the abdomen, deep seated in the middle of the hypogastrium. She remembers that she could push it aside in various directions without pain, and that at this time it was about the size of an orange. She can assign no cause for its ap- pearance. The tumour rapidly increased in bulk, until at the end of ten months the abdomen was greatly distended, so much so, that respiration and progression were rendered difficult. Para- centesis was now performed, and forty imperial pints of a viscid yellowish-coloured fluid were removed. The abdomen, however, again rapidly increased in size, and paracentesis was again had re- course to. The operation has now been performed six times, the intervals between each becoming less and less lengthened, and the amount of fluid, though always considerable, varying in amount. She says that immediately after every tapping a tumour can be felt about the size of a child’s head on each side of the abdomen; that these tumours (she thinks there arc two,) are moveable la- terally, but seem to grow from below. She thinks the one on the left side is larger and higher up than that on the right. Her ge- neral health has been little affected by the disease. A

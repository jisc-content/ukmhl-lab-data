by the absence of any softness or elasticity on the tumour being handled,—by the entire absence of any affection of the lymphatic glands in the neighbourhood,—by the soft parts and the integu- ment being freely moveable over the tumour,—and by the disease having shown no tendency to spread to and involve the integu- ment. On the last point it may be added, that some of the diag- nostic characters of the osteo-sarcoma, as distinguished from the osteo-encephaloma, (or true and originally malignant tumour of bone), are, that the former increases and spreads by continuity, being confined to the bone only, which becomes much expanded and attenuated, as was apparently the case in the tumour now under consideration;—whereas the latter, although it arises in the bone, yet does not confine itself to that tissue, but, after the part originally affected has become softened with- out much expansion, it extends and spreads more by contiguity than by continuity, so that, after having involved in its ravages all the various deep textures with which it comes into contact, it ultimately reaches the surface, the integument be- coming included in malignant ulceration. In the present instance, therefore, the appear- ances of the tumour favoured the opinion, that it, though now of a malignant nature, had origi- nated, and for some time advanced as an osteo- sarcoma,—the tendency to degeneration possessed by which having been increased, and its progress accelerated by the constant irritation of the tu- mour by the counter-irritants and rubefacients applied to it, and continued so long. On the muscles and other soft parts which la}r over the bone and tumour being dissected off, the disease presented the appearance represented in the accompanying sketch. On making a section of the tumour and bone, it was found to be of a somewhat peculiar nature, and to be different from what was to be expected from its external appearance. The shaft of the bone is entire, except near its middle, where it appears as if compressed by the tumour, which is external to it. The medullary canal is obliterated opposite to the bulk of the tu- mour, being filled up with apparently new osseous deposit; this, however, as well as the shaft of the bone, is more soft and sectile than natural. At about four inches from the lower epiphysis, the medullary canal is divided into lai’ge cells, in which sarcoma- tous substance has been deposited. The space also which in- tervenes between the walls of the cylinder, from the part surround- ed by the tumour up to the neck of the bone, is filled up with similar deposit. The section of the upper extremity of the bone

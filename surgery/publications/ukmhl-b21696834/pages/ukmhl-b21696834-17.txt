15 That tho dyspnoea arose from a spasmodic closure of the rima glot- tidis, and not merely from an inflammatory affection, is evident from the fact, that the dyspnoea was sudden and intermittent, having oc- curred without any previous affection of the larynx, or alteration of the voice, and also because there was no dyspnoea in the intervals between the fits; and farther, likewise, by the fact, that there was no affection of the voice, such as occurs in all inflammatory affec- tions of the larynx, whether acute or chronic. This consideration, indeed, is one of the chief points of interest in the case, from its showing how a Broncliocele may occasion dyspnoea to such an extent as to require the performance of tracheotomy, under circumstances too, where it has never, I believe, been hitherto performed. The operation of tracheotomy in this case was in itself both diffi- cult and uncertain, but no other alternative was left, except that of allowing, as must otherwise be done, the patient to die from as- phyxia ; and consequently, the operation was not only warrantable but demanded. The division of a portion of the Broncliocele, and the consequent profuse hemorrhage, were unavoidable, but at the same time, not necessarily attended by much danger; as pressure will be found in such circumstances, a sufficient hcemostatic, when it is firmly and methodically applied. The hemorrhage, however, in this case was rather salutary in its effects; as to it must be attributed the imme- diate, as well as the subsequent diminution in the size of the tu- mour, and the consequent removal or diminution of the pressure on the recurrent nerves, or on the trachea itself, which had given rise to the dyspnoea. The chief danger to be feared from the hemor- rhage in this case, was the entrance of blood into the trachea, and thence into the bronchi, as the depth of the former from the surface rendered the tube, which was the longest in common use, almost inefficient,—thus illustrating the great importance of having a tube of sufficient length for such cases ; as well as for others, where the parts over the trachea have become infiltrated and vascular. It is worthy of remark, that the tube was removed at noon, from there having been no return of the dyspnoea,—although the orifice of the tube had been intentionally occluded for some hours previously to its being removed. Moreover there was no recur- rence of the hemorrhage, an event which would also have con- necessarily suffer pressure from the increase of the tumour, either directly or througli the intervention of the trachea. That considerable pressure had been exerted on the latter, is evident, from its having been found forcibly displaced to one side, by that part of the tumour which embraced it so closely. The first efTect of this pressure would bo to irritate or stimulate the nerves, and thus to cause the spasmodic contraction of the muscles of the glotti.s, to all of which this nerve is distributed. Hence, closure of the •rima glottidis would result, giving rise to the croupy or crowing inspiration, with the difficult and prolonged expiration ; but after long-continued or severe pressure, tho op- posite condition—or paralysis of these muscles—would ensue, giving rise to sudden

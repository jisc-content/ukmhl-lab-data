DEPOPULATION 272 NATALITY AND disseminating information; and it is well that the facts should reach the people, without accompanying incitements to initiate the parents who have abandoned the responsi- bilities, not to speak of the happiness, of parenthood. Then, again, it would he well if the medical profession defined carefully the morbid consequences (if there are such) attach- ing to mari'iages voluntarily made sterile, and let these results be known to their patients. Information of the same kind might be given to the public by midwives and monthly nurses. There are ways in which an upward tendency in the birth-rate might be excited and fostered. There are, for instance, the legislative and fixed devices of giving abatement of income-tax to all fathers having families of more than .3 or 4 children or of ottering grants to the individual children in large families. In some way or other there might be an " endowment of motherhood" (Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1906, p. 1051). The evolution of a healthy public opinion on the subject could not fail to do good. Then, if it became clear that the birth- rate was rising, the preaching of eugenics would doubtless help to " improve the breed " by encouraging procreation by the fit and pre- venting it among the unfit. But it is to be feared that we are yet far from the days of a birth-rate going up by leaps and bounds, for it is doubtful whether any of the means suggested will prove efiicacious in stopping the downward trend for some years to come. But there are other ways in which the evil effects of a falling birth-rate may be lessened : we can attack the aggravations of diminished natality. We can try, for instance, to conserve the lives in utero which, under present circum- stances, run so many risks of never coming to the birth; in other words, we can endeavour to check abortions and still-births. The laws of antenatal life and health are beginning to be better understood, and it is known that parental alcoholism, that improper feeding of the pregnant woman, and that certain trades with their toxicological risks are specially dangerous to the unborn infant. The registra- tion of abortions and still-births, and perhaps of pregnancy {Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1907, p. 425), the prohibition of women working at certain trades during their pregnancies, the provision of pre-maternity hospitals for women suffering from the diseases of pregnancy, and possibly, as Havelock Ellis suggests, the establishment of a " State Department for the Unborn" might achieve much in preventing the present appalling wastage of antenatal life. Then, again, the prevention of eclampsia, of hyperemesis gravidarum, of chorea of the pregnant, and of other grave complications of gestation, founded upon a right understanding of the causation of these states, would save many foetal lives. The keeping alive of the prematurely-born infant by the perfecting of incubators and the devising of suitable methods of feeding would, of course, tend to lessen the high neonatal death-rate, and so for a time counteract the falling birth-rate. Further, and of the greatest importance, the spi-eading of knowledge as to the proper care and feeding of all new-born infants among all classes of the community could not fail to be most beneficial; the Huddersfield experiment might well be carried out on a large scale with advantage. The early notification of births now being widely adopted cannot do aught but good in enabling health visitors and others to get in touch with infant life before the ignorance or culpable carelessness of parents of a certain class convert it into early death. So, while it may not be possible yet to check the tendency to limit families, it may be quite practicable to save much life that is at present lost and so prevent the relative depopulation of our land and its fall to a secondary place among other nations.

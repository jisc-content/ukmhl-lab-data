MOMBERG'S METHOD OF ARRESTING HEMORRHAGE 266 death followed its use from the formation of a hsematoraa ; there ha^^e been instances of paral- ysis of the bladder and rectum, of ha3moptysis, of bleeding from the nose or bowel, and of per- sistent irregularity and weakness of the heart's action. The cardiac dangei- is perhaps the most serious, for the constriction by the tube always causes marked frequency of the pulse, the rate rising as high as 150 and even as 180 per min^^te. Gross and Binet {Lancet, i. for 1910, p. 1771) have recorded a fatal case in connection with amputation at the hip for tuberculosis of the knee ; the heart ceased to act when the tubing was taken off. Another fatal case was reported by Amberger {Beitr. z. klin. Chir., Ixvi. p. 46.3, 1910).

Von Noorden's "Oatmeal Cure."—Von Noorden advises a special oatmeal cure in certain cases of diabetes. He states that in many cases oatmeal is well borne in comparison with other carbohydrates. This only applies when oatmeal is given alone ; when added to a mixed diet it seems to have no special advantage. The oatmeal is given in the form of well boiled gruel or porridge, to which eggs, or vegetable protein, and butter are added. Brandy and strong black coffee are also allowed. The ordinary daily ration consists of oatmeal 250 grams (9 ozs.), 7 or 8 eggs, and (300 grams) 10 ozs. of butter. On this treatment some diabetics become free from sugar, although they remained glycosuric on a strict diet. Von Noorden dis- tinguishes three possible good results :—(1) Glycosuria disappears; (2) glycosuria diminishes; (3) glycosuria uninfluenced, or may even rise, but the assimilation of carbohydrate is im- proved, and acidosis is overcome. The cure is not always successful. Von Noorden advises it only in severe cases with acidosis. Why oatmeal is tolerated better than other carbo- hydrates is not known. Siegel reports good results, and Langstein treated a child of one and a half years thus with some success When first introduced, the oatmeal diet was given continuously for several weeks; now Von Noorden advises that it should be limited to three-day periods, each preceded by one or two " green days," interpolated in the ordinary regime of strict dieting.

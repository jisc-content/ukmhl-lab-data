237 LABOUR: POST-PARTUM HEMORRHAGE summarises very fairly the whole discission which has arisen regarding the method of treatment which has been so enthusiastically advocated by Le Page, when he writes : " Although inferior to direct compression of the uterus, pressure on the abdominal aorta is a method which is of undeniable value in post-partum haemorrhage. In exceptional cases it may be the most readily employed and the quickest means of effecting arrest, but that can scarcely be regarded as a sufficient reason, merely for the sake of uniformity, for attempt- ing to substitute it in all cases for methods which have not only proved their utility and efficiency, but are at the same time in accord- ance with the natural method and more scien- tific. The method has, undoubtedly, its value, and it is unfortunate that those who advocate it have taken up the position that it is the only means of arresting post-partum haemorrhage. They have done good service in emphasising its value, but have gone far towards defeating the object they had in view by their intemperate denunciation of methods which are not only theoretically superior, but which are the out- come of, and have stood the test of, long experience." If uterine compression be regarded as the method of checking post-partum haemorrhage which is generally to be preferred, it is essential that it be applied in the best way ; and it must be confessed that it is sometimes rendered ineffective by wrongly-directed manipulations. Fritsch {JDeidsche med. Wochensch., xxx. p. 19, 1904) has suggested a thorough method of exercising uterine compression in the rare cases in which the excitation of contraction of the womb is almost impossible : the uterus is brought forward in the abdomen by pressing both hands behind it; it is thus forced into an anteflexed position over the symphysis pubis ; into the depression behind it towels or pledgets of wool are packed; a binder is then passed round the abdomen and firmly fixed so as to compress the uterus against the symphysis and keep the pads m situ; and the binder is allowed to remain on for some hours till the vessels have thrombosed, and the danger has passed away.

Lacteol Tablets. — Tablets which produce lactic acid when added to fresh milk; they are recommended in the antiseptic treat- ment of autointoxication and catarrhal condi- tions of the intestine. Lacticaciduria. — See Eclampsia (Theories of Origiii). Lactimase.—A proprietary preparation designed to prevent putrefactive processes in the intestine ; it is stated to act by the pro- duction of lactic acid. See Lancet, i. for 1910, p. 307. Lactitia. — A proprietary infant food preparation made from buttermilk. See Report in Lancet, i. for 1909, p. 1465. LactO- bac i 11 b n e. — Metchnikoff's pre- paration for producing soured milk and nascent lactic acid which is recommended in various intestinal ailments; Cantlie (Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1910, p. 875) is of opinion that it is of little value in such tropical intestinal diseases as sprue and post-dysenteric states. For a detailed discussion of lactic acid therapy see Griinbaum, Tanner, Hewlett, Bryce, Harley, Sahli, and others in the British Medical Jourtial, ii. for 1910, pp. 1583-1593. See also the Lancet, ii. for 1908, pp. 1600, 1678. LactO Food. — A proprietary food preparation, described as " a malted food, containing in suitable proportions the nutritive constituents of milk." See Report in Lancet, ii. for 1908, p. 1374. Lactone Tablets. — A proprietary preparation which is described as a pure culture of lactic acid bacilli, and is active in producing buttermilk. See Lancet, ii. for 1908, p. 284. Lactose rum.—A serum of cow's milk prepared by Dr. Raoul Blondel, by coagulating milk with hydrochloric acid or rennet, and filtering off the whey through muslin and an Arsonval candle (under pressure of carbonic acid gas); it is thus sterilised at the same time ; the whey contains milk sugar and salts and the ferments of the milk (especially the oxydases); and when it is injected under the skin it causes an increase in leucocytosis, a fall of temperature (in fever), a discharge of uric acid, and a fall in blood pressure. Dr. Blondel has found it of service in pneumonia, and specially in the arterial hypertension of arterio-sclerosis. See Lancet, i. for 1909, pp. 1038-1040. LaiOSe.—A substance closely resembling

Nasvi.—The same freezing method with carbon dioxide as is described under Lupus Erythematosus has also been found very useful in the treatment of pigmented nsevi. The lesions, of course, require to have a longer application of the COo snow, so as to be frozen to a greater depth. The result is at first the formation of a bulla, which bursts and crusts ovei-, and when the crust falls off a fine scar is left. Should one application not have com- pletely removed the nsevus, the same treatment is repeated. Besides being of use in pigmented ntevi, good results have been obtained in vascular na3vi. The advantages of the method are its easy application, its painlessness, and the beauty of the scar which it leaves behind. Warts may also be readily treated by the same freezing method, the application being of such short duration, and made with such slight pressure, that no scar results. Nakayama'S Test.—A very delicate test for bile pigments in the urine : the urine is treated with barium chloride solution, and centrifuged, when a reagent consisting of alcohol, concentrated hydrochloric acid, and ferric chloride is added to the precipitate and the mixture heated to boiling-point, a bluish- green or green solution is got, which becomes violet or red on the addition of nitric acid. <See Webster, Diagnostic Methods, p. 316, 1909.

Falling Birth-Rate .... 269' Causes . . . . . .270 Effects 271 Treatme7it . . . . . .271 Literature 272: Until the close of the nineteenth centurj^ the question of natality or the birth-rate in its- relation to population had scarcely come to be pressing for any country save France; but with the beginning of the twentieth century has come the knowledge that a falling birth-rate is no longer a Gallic prerogative, but has become a common attribute of the civilised nations of the world. The tendency to limit families, and so to prepare the way for what has been called "race-suicide," has spread from the Latin to the Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon peoples, and from Europe to America and. Australia. The birth-rate of a country, formerly a matter of mild interest to the statistician and of self-congratulation to the politician, has suddenly come to be a question of national importance, and possibly of grave anxiety, to- the rulers of the land. When, from the stand- point of international relationships and of high politics, it became evident that a decline in the birth-rate of one country, with no such decline in a neighbouring state, might fairly be trans- lated into the terms of a condition of less readi- ness for defence on the part of the former and of greater preparedness and capacitj^ for attack on that of the latter nation, natality had at once secured for itself the position of a world- problem. As soon as it was realised that a fall of 1 or 2 pei- thousand in the birth-rate meant, for a large nation like France, the lack in the next generation of citizens capable of military service equal in number to an army corps, the gravity of the question of natality could no- longer be ignored. No sooner were the decennial census returns for Great Britain published than it became evident that there had taken place a serious fall in the birth-rate of this country. To this marked decline Dean Freemantle drew atten- tion in the Times (vide Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1901, p, 1630), and on it Stead commented in the Review of Reviews (xxiv. p. 14, 1901); the matter had clearly passed out of the sphere of medicine, and had become one of general interest. The Dean of Ripon pointed out that in a quarter of a centurj^ (viz. between the years 1875 and 1900) the birth-rate of the United Kingdom had fallen from 35 per thousand to 29 per thousand. For the popu- lation of i\\ millions inhabiting these islands there was, therefore, now an annual deficiency (at the present rate) of 249,000 babies. This was a more rapid decline than had taken place in France where the process had been slower

EDITORIAL T^OTE Ik accordance with the promise made in the tenth volume of Green's Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine and Surgery the first supplementary volume to that work now makes its appearance. Five years have nearly passed since the first volume of the Encyclopedia and Dictionary issued from the press, so that the present instalment may he regarded as the first of a series of quinquennial surveys of the whole field of medical practice, setting forth the notable advances which have taken place, and forming a reliable guide to the new methods of treatment which have come into use, and which seem likely to remain as permanent additions to oui" resources for healing disease and for alleviating suffering. The same plan of construction as was employed for the ten volumes of the Encyclopedia and. Dictionary has been used here.

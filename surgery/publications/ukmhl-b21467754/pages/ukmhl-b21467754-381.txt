Schmidt for the treatment of chronic constipation, consisting of flake agar- agar, with a small proportion of an aqueous non-bitter extract of cascara sagrada; it is believed to act mechanically, absorbing water in the stomach, carrying it on, and so making the intestinal contents soft, whilst the cascara acts locallj^ upon the intestinal mucous mem- brane ; it consists of brownish scales, and the dose is from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful once daily with food. See also Pararegulin, For Report see Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1910, p. 1725 ; Lancet, i. for 1910, p. 1545. Remineraiisation. — The replace ment of the lost mineral constituents of the tissues of the body (due to various conditions, including errors in dieting which produce demineralisation) by their addition to the food, in the form of calcium carbonate, mag- nesium oxide, magnesium chloride, iodine in organic combination. See H. Higgins, Lancet, i. for 1910, pp. 482-491. Renag'iandin. — This preparation is described as a concentrated natural solution of all the active principles of the suprarenal glands, standardised so that each drachm of the solution equals 5 grains of the fresh gland; it is specially recommended in various hasmorrhagic states. Renestypticin. — One of the many trade names for the active principle of the suprarenal gland. Residuum Rubrum. — The dried residue of ox blood, recommended in aneemia, scurvy, osteo-arthritis, etc. ; the dose is 5 grains thrice daily, and it is made up as 5-grain " tabloids " {Tabloid Eesidui Ruhri). Resistance.—As applied to red blood corpuscles this term means specially resistance to variations in the osmotic pressure of the blood and to haemolysis; it is the tendency which the red cells have not to shrink or swell -or undergo haemolysis. Riiabdonema Strong-yioides.— A synonym of Strongyloides intesthialis, one of the angiostomidffi ; Anguilhda intestinalis. Rheumatin.—A trade name for the salicyl-quinine ester; a colourless, almost in- soluble powder, recommended (in doses of 30 to 90 grains per diem) in acute rheumatism. See Fortescue-Brickdale, Weaver Remedies, p. 249, 1910. Rhinocuiin Cream.—A preparation, coming from Germany, for the relief of hay fever, which consists of a pure fatty basis and a non-poisonous local anassthetic. See Report in Lancet, ii. for 1909, p. 302. Rhinosporidia Kinealyi.—•S'ee Pro- tozoa {Spo7-ozoa). Rhythm, IModal.-<S'ee Heart, Dis- eases of {Nodal Rhythm). Ribbert's Theory. — A theory of tumour-formation, according to which cell dis- placement (cell-rest) is the first step, and the active growth which may follow results from diminished external resistance ; in accordance with this theory it must therefore be postulated that changes in the surrounding tissues abro- gating the restraining tissue tension precede the cell overgrowth. See Adami, Pathology, i. pp. 837-838, 1910. Ricketts' Organism.—Apleomorphic polar-staining bacillus alleged to be the causal agent in Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. See H. T. Ricketts, Journ. Amer. Med. Assoc., Hi. p. 379, 1909; Trans. Chicago Path. Soc, vii. p. 254, 1907-9. Riegei's iVIethod.—A test for chy- mosin (rennin), the second ferment of the gastric juice; the neutralised gastric juice (3 to 5 c.c.) is added to fresh milk (5 to 10 c.c), and placed in the incubator for fifteen minutes, and if distinct coagulation occur chymosin (rennin) is present. Riegei Test Meal.—A meal given in the middle of the day and consisting of about 400 c.c. of soup, 200 grams of beefsteak, and either two slices of white bread or 150 grams of mashed potato, with one glass of water ; it is removed at the end of three or four hours by the stomach tube, and is used to determine whether the gastric relations are normal or abnormal. See Webster, Diagnostic Methods, p. 50, 1909. " RiesenwuchS,"—Giant growth; this term is used not only in Germany, but also in this country for a number of conditions of overgrowth whose pathogenesis is obscure.

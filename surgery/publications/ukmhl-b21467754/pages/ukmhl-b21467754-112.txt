CESAREAN SECTION 80 was introduced by Frank in 1907 {Arch. f. Gynaek., Ixxxi. p. 46, 1907), and modified by Sellheim and others in 1908 {Zentralh. f. Gi/ndJc., xxxii. p. 133, 1908). The anterior abdominal wall is cut through by means of a transverse incision (down to the peritoneum) a few centi- metres above the symphysis pubis (the patient being in the Trendelenburg position); the peri- toneum is then sepai'atcd from the posterior sur- face of the bladder and from the anterior surface of the lower uterine segment, and fixed to the parietal pei-itoneum in the upper margin of the incision ; in this way the lower part of the uterus is laid bare, and yet the peritoneal sac is kept closed; a transverse cut is then made into the uterine cavity, and the child and placenta are extracted through it; and, finally, the uterine incision is closed with sutures, the parts restored to their normal relationships, and the abdominal wound closed. A plug of iodoform gauze may be used for drainage. The advantages claimed for this method are that it is done extra-peritoneally, that haemorrhage is slight, that there is no trouble with the intestines, that the risk of infection of the peritoneal cavity from below is much lessened, that there is an opportunity for the expulsion of the child and placenta by the natural eflbrts, that the chances of ventral hernia are lessened, and that the patient can rise earlier. Frank reported thirteen cases thus operated on, and in all of them the mother recovered. Sellheim {Zentralh. f. Gyniik., xxxii. pp. 133, 319, 1908) soon afterwards de- scribed five cases in which he operated extra- peritoneally, but with some alterations in the technique: he made a transverse concave in- cision (Pfannenstiel), but only carried it down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the fascia; then he split the fascia to the width of the skin incision; then the recti muscles were separated from each other and the peritoneum stripped of their inner surfaces, as also from the surface of the bladder (which had been distended with water so as to carry upwards the reflection of peritoneum). The cervix uteri was then opened into in the middle line by means of a longitudinal in- cision (not by a transverse one, as practised by Frank), the child and placenta were extracted, and the incision closed in the usual way. One of Sellheim's five cases died. Fromme, in Veit's Clinique {Zentralh. f. Gyniik., xxxii. pp. 301, 545, 1908 ; Berl. klin. IVochenschr., xlv. p. 147, 1908), also preferred the longitudinal incision, and reported seven cases; he, how- ever, divided the uterine peritoneum longi- tudinally and stitched it together again later, and thus avoided the lifting up of the bladder; in fact Veit's later method differed markedly from Frank's. Other modifications M'cre intro- duced by Baumm {Zentralh. f. Gyniik., xxxii. p. 451, 1908), Czyzewicz {ihid., p. 817), Doder- lein {ihid., xxxiii., p. 121, 1909), and Freund {ihid., p. 560, 1909). There had been all along a tendency to divide the peritoneum tempor- arily, making the operation a trans-peritoneal (rather than a truly extra-peritoneal) one, but Doderlein and Freund endeavoured to ensure an entirely exti'a-peritoneal approach by entering from the side. It is probable that other modi- fications will yet be introduced, for, at present, the operation is rather difficult. Sellheim's latest modification, delivery through a utero- ahdominal fistula, is a long and complicated operation, involving a great deal of prelimin- ary suturing of parietal peritoneum to skin and of uterine peritoneum to parietal peritoneum before the uterus is opened into. It will not I'eplace the ordinary conservative operation for uninfected cases, but it is very likely to prove of value in the perplexing class in which efforts have already been made to deliver, in which the child is still alive, and in which the ob- stetrician hesitates to employ the ordinary Caesarean section on account of the risk of giving the infection access to the peritoneum. It may also be found useful in cases of threat- ening rupture of the uterus and in blocking of the pelvis by neoplasms of the internal genera- tive organs.

Conclusions.—It is difficult to forecast the position which Csesarean section in its various forms is likely to occupy in the immediate future. At present there is undoubtedly a very strong tendency to extend its employment to a wide range of cases, and, if the trans-

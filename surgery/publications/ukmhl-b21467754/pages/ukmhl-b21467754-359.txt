301 PREGNANCY, MANAGEMENT OF maternity bed or beds should be strictly reserved for the reception of cases of morbid pregnancy ; if a patient suffering from one of the maladies of pregnancy pass into labour within forty-eight hours of her reception into the pre-maternity bed she shall not be regarded as a pre-maternity case, for, obviously, such a brief stay does not permit of any satisfactory attempt towards the efiective treatment of her malady; the pre-maternity beds should be placed in a ward by themselves, and should not be located in the ordinary ward used for the puerperal patients; a sister should be in charge of these beds who has a surgical and medical as well as an obstetric experience, for the nursing required will in most instances be more strictly medical or surgical than obstet- rical ; no attempt should be made to adapt the diet of puerperal patients for the use of the pre-maternity patients, for, as a rule, the latter require quite different food ; special case-taking forms should be used for the pre-maternity cases ; a special case-book should be kept in which every patient who has been in the pre- maternity bed for the period of more than forty-eight hours, for such cases, if successfully treated, will sometimes not remain in the hospital for delivery, e.g. retroversion of the gravid uterus at the third month; in pre- maternity cases special attention should be paid to urine analysis, to examination of the blood and of the blood pressure, to that of the nervous system, to ophthalmoscopic investigations, to a detailed and thorough examination of the signs and symptoms of pregnancy, including estima- tions and descriptions of the foetal heart and of the foetal movements. Then, with regard to pre-maternity wards or hospitals: the ward or hospital should be connected with the maternity hospital, but should not be included in it; the pre-maternity portion should re- semble more closely an ordinary general hospital in its construction and arrangement than a maternity hospital; the management of the pre-maternity should be kept as far as possible distinct from that of the maternity, the nursing, diet, regimen, and to some extent the medical treatment required being different; there should be a resident physician whose business it would be to take charge of the pre- maternity hospital, whilst the physician of the maternity hospital would make a daily visit; and the supervention of labour would always be the signal for the transference of a patient from the pi'e-maternity to the maternity hospital, her record would go with her, and would serve as a guide for diagnosis and treatment in the other part of the building. Suitable cases for treatment in pre-maternity beds, wards, or hospitals are pregnant patients suffering from albuminuria, heart disease, intractable vomiting, pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, anajmia and other blood disorders, and various nervous maladies (especially epilepsy, chorea gravi- darum, hystero-epilepsy, hysteria, and paralysis), diseases of the repi-oductive organs (such as retroversion of the gravid uterus, threatened abortion, pruritus and cedema vulvae, uterine prolapse, cystocele, vulvar inflammation and abscess, uterine myomata, and suspected ectopic gestation), and hydramnios and other condi- tions leading to over-distension of the uterus ; and cases of suspected hydatid mole, of placental htemorrhage, missed labour, or of antenatal death or deformity might with advantage be kept under observation. Further, patients who had suffered in past j)regnancies from habitual abortion, " habitual" foetal death or disease, habitual prematurity or post-maturity, or from eclampsia, might be dieted, kept at rest, or treated with medicinal means, etc., in future pregnancies in order, if possible, to prevent the recuixence of these reproductive disasters. Patients who have already had one or more eclamptic seizures are not so suitable for pre-maternity treatment; but even in them labour does not always supervene immediately, and purely medical treatment for a few days may be possible and may serve to save the mother's if not also the child's life (vide Journ. Ohstet. and Gyncec. Brit. Emp., xv. p. 98, 1909). Cases which are unsuitable for treatment in a pre-maternity bed or ward would seem to be infectious fevers occurring as complications of pregnancy and cases of insanity; cases of syphilis, gonorrhoea, and gonorrhoeal vaginitis and vulvitis might be dealt with if care were used to avoid infection ; alcoholism and dipso- mania, in the absence of delirium tremens, might also be admitted, but they would necessitate more watching and nursing than could be easily given. Pregrnancy, Physiolog:y of.â€”Since the beginning of the twentieth century many contributions have been made to our knowledge of the physiology of pregnancy, but it cannot yet be said that we have enough information regarding the inter-relation of the lives of mother and unborn infant to enable us to understand the maladies peculiar to pregnancy and to take adequate means for their prevention or cure. This is true in a very special way of eclampsia {vide ECLAMPSIA), and applies also to hyperemesis gravidarum, to jaundice in preg- nancy, and to chorea of the pregnant woman. For this reason there is no uniformity of belief regarding such means of treatment as the emptying of the uterus in the diseases which have been named, as well as in pregnancies complicated by heart disease, by pneumonia, by tuberculosis, and by epilepsy. But every contribution that is made to the better know- ledge of the physiology of pregnancy is of value, and no single work is of greater importance than that which has recently

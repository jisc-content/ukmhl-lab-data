MENSTRUATION, MORBID 262 time distribution being as follows :—first six weeks, 37; second six weeks, 62 : three to twelve months, 100; later. 4 ; and 31 were indefinite. Heil's general conclusion was, about half only of all women who are nursing their infants have absolute amenorrha?a ; he thought that the appearance of the menses during lacta- tion was not a reason for weaning ; and he was of opinion that menstruation, and not amenorrha?a, was the original normal condition with women during lactation. These observations must Ije taken into account in connection with the common j^ractice of weaning on the appearance of menstruation. Apparently ablactation is not so necessary in that case as has been sup- posed; and probably the supervention of another pregnancy is a far more pressing indication for \veaning, as Church has pointed out in an article on the risks of allowing lactation and pregnancy to overlap (Trans. Edin. Ohstet. Soc, xxviii. p. 204, 1903). 2. Dysmenorrhcea. — It was towards the close of 1896 that Fliess {Zentralh. f. Gyndk, xxi. p. Ill, 1897) made a communication to the Berlin Obstetrical and Gynecological Society in which he claimed that there existed a close con- nection between the nasal mucous membrane and menstruation. The forms of dysmenorrhcea in which the pain continued after the appear- ance of the Ijleeding had in a great number of cases their origin in the nose. This was not to be wondered at, for during menstruation regular changes occurred in the nose, and these con- sisted of swelling, increased sensitiveness to touch, a tendenc}^ to bleed, and cyanotic dis- coloration. These changes were most marked on the inferior turbinated bones and on the tubercula septi, and to these spots in particular the name of the " genital areas " of the nose might l)e given. Temporary' relief of the pain of dysmenorrhcea Avas obtained by applying cocaine to these "genital spots," and in some cases the relief was made permanent by cauter- ising the same regions. Since the publication of Fliess's article the subject has been investi- gated by manj^ obsei'vers, who have to a certain extent corroborated Fliess's statements, and found benefit to accrue from the nasal treat- ment recommended. It has been found to be diflicult to eliminate entirely the possil)ility of cure by suggestion. A. Schiff' (Wien. klin. Wochensch., xiv. pp. 57-65, etc., 1901) found that cocainisation of the tubercula septi relieved the sacralgia, whilst the abdominal pain was also benefited when the " nasal spots" on the inferior turbinateds were similarly treated. A few drops of a 20 per cent, solution of cocaine were applied on cotton-wool. In a smaller number of cases permanent relief followed cauterisation. A. Ephraim (Al/g. med. Centr.- Ztg., Ixxi. pp.229, 241, 1902) obtained good results in thi-ee-fourths of the patients whom he treated l)y cocainisation of the " genital spots." During the past six or seven years a considerable number of communications on this subject, and on the nearly allied one of the relationship between the nasal mucous mem- brane and the genital organs in the male, have appeared in current medical literature, and among these maj^ be named papers by Hall {Westminster Hosp. Rej>., xii. p. 65, 1901), Hey- mann (Verhandl. d. Gesellsch. f. Geburtsh. zu Leipz., p. 41, 1902), Jaworski and Iwanicki (Gaz. lek., 2 S., xxii. pp. 429, 456, 1902), Kronig (Verhandl. d.

Med. Assoc., li. p. 1077, 1908). Although the question cannot yet be regarded as definitely settled, it may be said that there is a considerable body of evidence in support of the belief in the existence of what may be called nasal dysmenorrhcea, and a certain amount of proof that local nasal treatment (by the appli- cation of cocaine to the "genital spots" on the septum nasi and inferior turbinateds) is bene- ficial in a large proportion of these cases. Of course it is well known that certain odours and perfumes stimulate the genital sense (see A. Hagen, Die se-cuelle Osphresiologie (Cliarlotten- burg), 1901, and others), and cases of priapism as a nasal reflex are not unknown (Hobbs, Gaillard's South. Med., Ixxxiv. p. 187, 1906); and these facts increase the likelihood of the existence of nasal dysmenorrhaea. Fui'ther, it has been shown by H. W. Freund {MonatsscJi. f. Geburtsh. u. Gynak., xx. pp. 210, 383, 1904) and others that nasal and pharyngeal changes are associated with the processes of pregnancy, labour, and the puerperium, as well as with the phenomenon of menstruation. Freund found that 66 per cent, of pregnant women had hyperaemia of the pharyngeal mucous mem- brane and hypertrophy of the turl>inatcd bones

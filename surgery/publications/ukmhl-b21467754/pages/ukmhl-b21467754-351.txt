Pituitrin. — A proprietary extract of the pituitary gland, said to contain the active principles of the infundibular part of that body; it is described as acting on the cir- culation similarly to adrenalin, as increasing nitrogenous metabolism, as affecting the heart similarly to digitalis and strophanthus, and as causing diuresis. Piutinol. — A proprietary preparation forming a reddish-brown fluid containing pine oils and sulphur dissolved in alcohol and glycerine; it is recommended for application as a sulphur bath in rheumatism, gout, and certain skin diseases. See Reports in Lancet, i. for 1910, p. 307 ; Brit. Jled. Journ., i. for 1910, p. 1298. Pia.g'ue.—In a paper entitled " Recent Researches into the Etiology of Plague in India," Col. Banner man, the Director of the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory, summarises the conclusions to which these lead in the follow- ing words:—1. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious, but being rare (less than 3 per cent, of all cases) plays a very small part in the spread of the disease. 2. Bubonic plague in man is not infectious, and is entirely dependent on the disease in the rat. 3. The infection is conveyed from rat to rat, and from rat to man, solely by means of the rat-flea. 4. Plague is usually conveyed from place to place by rat-fleas brought by people in their baggage or on their persons. The present epidemic of plague in India dates from the autumn of 1896 ; in China it had broken out two years previously. One of the features of the Indian epidemic which soon became apparent, was that in each locality it had a particular seasonal prevalence of its own: thus in Bombay, the epidemic occurs in the early months of the year ; in Poona, only 80 miles away, the disease does not appear till the autumn. As epidemic succeeded epidemic facts came to light which pointed to the existence of infected houses—such houses were most infective by night; they might become infec- tive even where standing empty; houses in close proximity became infective, although caste prejudices ensured that the inhabitants had no inter-communication. These and other facts suggest the idea of spread by animals, and the only animal that fills the role is the house rat of India. Notwithstanding the adverse criticism passed by the first Plague Commission on Simond's suggestion that the flea might communicate the disease from rat to rat and from rat to man, Liston rein- vestigated the subject, and placed the theory on an assured basis. Two species of rats are common in Bombaj^ —mus rattus, the black rat, and mus decii- mamis, the bi'own Norway rat. The former is the house rat proper; the latter lives apart from the people in gullies and sewers. They meet in the basements of houses. Mus decio- manus develops plague before mus rattus, but man is more likely to become infected by mus rattus, with which he is brought into more intimate contact. The fleas of rats (pnlex cheojns) are of a different species from those of man, hwt in the absence of rats this flea will take to other animals and even to man. In the stomachs of these fleas, taken from plague- infected houses, living plague germs are found. When rats die of plague the infected fleas leave them and begin to attack other animals— e.g. guinea-pigs—and transmit the disease to them ; thej' also bite man, and infect him. Bannerman considers that there is no evi- dence that rats spread plague by infecting food with their excreta, nor by contaminating the soil, suppositions which have both been entertained to account for the spread of the disease. Major Lamb, of the Second Plague Com- mission, writes, concerning the experimental transmissions of plague from rats to rats, monkeys, etc. :—"(«) Close and continuous con- tact of plague-infected animals with healthy animals, if fleas be excluded, does not give rise to an epizootic among the healthy animals. As the godowns [experimental huts] were never cleaned out, close contact includes con- tact with fajces and urine of infected animals. Close contact, even the suckling of young by plague-infected mothers, does not give rise to the disease. (5) Where fleas are present the epizootic, if it does start, varies in severity and rate of pi'ogress according to the season of the year and the number of fleas present. The season in which epizootics are readily produced experimentally, and spread rapidly, corre- sponds with tiiat of the plague epidemic, (c) An epizootic of plague can occur in a godown containing infected fleas without direct con- tact of healthy animals and infected animals.

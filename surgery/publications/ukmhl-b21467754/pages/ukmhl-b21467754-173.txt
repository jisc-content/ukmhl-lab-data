ECTOPIC PREGNANCY 135 is becoming more frequent cannot be easily determined ; certainly it is more often diagnosed. The following articles bearing chiefly on etiology may be named:â€”Fellner, Bp.rl. klin. therap. Wochensch., p. 76, 1904 ; ihid., Arch. f. Gi/naek., Ixxiv. p. 481, 1904-5; Fiith, Arch./.

Some varieties of tubal pregnancy which were at one time regarded as very rare and even unique are now known to be comparatively common. Some of these may be briefly re- ferred to. (1) There is, first, the occurrence of pregnancy in both Fallopian tubes at the same time ; cases illustrating this form of plural ectopic pregnancy, which may be called bilateral tubal gestation, have been reported by Kristinus {Wieyi. klin. Wochensch., xv. p. 1250, 1902), Sandberg and Burford {Journ. Surg. Gynec. and Obstet., xxvii. p. 482, 1905), and others; but, of course, it can never be quite certain that the two ^pregnancies were of the same age, and as a matter of fact, in several of the recorded cases they have definitely l)een shown to be of different ages (see Jayle and Nandrot, Bev. de gynec. et de chir. abd., viii. p. 195, 1904). It is very probable that these cases are generally instances of repeated tubal pregnancy ; thus in Haig Ferguson's observation {Trans. Edin. Obstet. Soc, xxiv. p. 37, 1899), the right tube con- tained a lithopsedion, while the left one showed a recent pregnancy of about three months. (2) Repeated tubal jjregnancy must, therefore, be reckoned as a second rare variety of ectopic gestation, as, indeed, a more frequent occur- rence than simultaneous bilateral tubal preg- nancy. Ferguson {loc. cit.) collected from literature between fifty and sixty such cases ; in most of them the second tubal pregnancy occurred on the opposite side, but this was not constant, for Taylor {Brit. Gyncec. Journ., xiv. p. 94, 1898) had noted an instance in which the same tube was the site of the second implantation. Saniter's observation is difficult of interpretation ; if it were repeated pregnancy in the same tube, then the relative size of the two embryos would indicate a difference in age of only one month ; but it may have been a twin gestation with a difference in the rate of development of the two ova {Zeitsch. f. Gehurtsh. u. Gyndk., Iv. p. 492, 1905). Since 1898 the number of records of repeated tubal pregnancy has been greatly increased, and in not a few instances the patient has been twice operated upon, twice by abdominal section {e.g. Dawson's case, Journ. Obstet and Gynmc. Brit. Emp., Hi. p. 301, 1903 ; Purslow, Trans. Obstet. Soc. Lond., xlvii. p. 181, 1906). In Kokmann's case {Zentralh. f. Gyndk, xxi. p. 1221, 1897) a normal pregnancy and labour intervened between the two tubal gestations. Two ruptured tubal pregnancies in the same patient within a year have been reported by M'Donnell {Aitstralas. Med. Gaz., xxvi. p. 287, 1907). (3) A third variety, which must still be reckoned as of great rarity, is the association of an ovarian pregnancy of one side with a tubal gestation of the other ; in Psaltoff's case {Ann. de yyn^c et d'obstet., lix. p. 376, 1903) the ovarian on the left side had an age of five years, while the tubal on the right side did not count more than five months. (4) Another variety is the presence of twins in a tubal gestation sac ; and the foetuses may be of the same or of different ages. Cases have been reported by Child {A^ner. Journ. Obstet., Iv. p. 94, 1907), Gos,ta {Ann. di ostet, i. for 1907, p. 185), Ferroni {Zentralb. f. Gyndk., xxvii. p. 275, 1903), Heinricius and Kolster {Arch. f. Gynaek., Iviii. p. 95, 1899), Le Dentu {Bull, acad. de med., 3 s. xxxv. p. 214, 1896), and Rutherford {Lancet, i. for 1907, p. 881). Under this heading may be placed the still more extraordinary occu'Tence of a double monster being found in a pregnant tube (Kirchhoff, Zentralb. f. Gyndk., xviii. p. 232, 1894). (5) What must surely be the i-arest of complications is a triple ectopic gestation, and yet a case has been reported by Krusen {Proc. Phila. Co. Med. Soc, N. S., iii. p. 292, 1901-2); and Michin has described an instance in which a simple pregnancy occurred in one tube and was fol- lowed two years later by a twin pregnancy in the same tube {Monatssch. f. Gehurtsh. u. Gyndk., xxii. p. 455, 1905). (6) A sixth variety is the simultaneous occurrence of intra- uterine (normal) pregnancy and extra-uterine (tubal) pregnancy. This cannot now be regarded as of great rarity, for Neugebauer has collected together 171 cases, including two seen by himself {Zur Lehre von der Zxvillingsschwangerschaft niit heterotopew, Sitz der Friichte (Leipzig), 1907). Further, the sub-varieties have been shown to be more numerous than was once supposed. For instance, the extra - uterine pregnancy which is discovered during or after the course of the normal intrauterine one may be of some years' standing; it may be what has been called a sequeste7-ed ectopic gestation, or one in which the foetus has died and been converted into a lithopaidion or adipocere ; and the extra-uterine sac may be a cause of delay and danger dui'ing the birth of the intra-uterine foetus. Another sub-variety is that in which the ectopic gestation is early

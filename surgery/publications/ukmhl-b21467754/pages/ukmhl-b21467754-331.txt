Nephritis, Treatment of.—In the dietetic management of nephritis the modern tendency is to favour reducing by every possible means the nitrogenous constituents of the food in acute cases, but to allow a more liberal diet than was formerly approved of in chronic parenchymatous and interstitial nephritis. Dr. J. M. Finny, in a recent paper on the subject, adopts the view of those who hold that it is a mistake to order milk ad libitum in acute nephritis; milk contains too much albumen and too much water—it is, therefore, a doubtful practice, as well as un- scientific, to endeavour, on the one hand, to save the kidney, whose function of secreting water by the glomeruli is in abeyance, and, on the other, to order four' or five pints of milk in the twenty-four hours, to add to the already overfull circulation. In very acute cases von Noorden believes it is best to give no nitrogen—nothing but sugar and water and fruit juice for from three to eight days at a stretch (often 200 to 300 grams of sugar daily). For less acute cases, milk combined with some such farinaceous food as arrowroot, cornflour, Benger's food, etc., should be given, and in every instance cream and sugar should be added. Von Noorden gives a sample of a daily menu containing a minimum of protein, yet possessing high nutritive value, as follows: — Milk, 150 grams; cream, 375 grams ; rice, 50 grams ; rusk, 50 grams ; butter, 50 grams; sugar, 20 grams; it contains 2900 calories. Such a diet is suitable for acute nephritis. In convalescence the milk is to be increased to 2| litres, and white bread, cereals, cream cheese, and a little egg and meal are added. Free libations of fluid, given with the idea of flushing out the kidneys, do more harm than good until the excretion of urine is fully re-established. In chronic nephritis, whether interstitial or parenchymatous, von Noorden allows a daily ration of 6 to 7 ozs. of meat, either red or white, in addition to the above. Any considerable deficiency of protein affects the general strength and nutrition of patients suff"ering from Bright's disease, even though the excretion of albumin may be temporarily diminished. He advises, however, that there should be an occasional interpolation of a period (7 to 14 days) of strict non-proteid diet. Chloride-free Diet.—Cases of acute and chronic parenchymatous nephritis, especially the latter, accompanied by dropsy, often improve rapidly on a diet free from chloride of sodiimi. The excretion of urine rises, the ojdema disappears, and, coincidently therewith, the albumin in the urine diminishes. The introduction of this method of treatment-— " dechlorination "—is due chiefly to the work of Widal and Javal, who have thrown much light on the salt-interchange of the body and the nature of ojdema. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that the almost universal practice of adding salt to food is necessary to health. Among uncivilised races there are many exceptions to the rule, and alleged instances of ill-health following privation from salt break down on scrutiny. The actual bodily require- 18

392 UTERUS, NON-MALIGNANT TUMOURS OF hysterectomy upon three sisters for fibroids of the uterus {Brit. Med. Joiirn., ii. for 1905, p. 924), and Macpherson Lawrie (ibid., i, for 1904, p. 357; ii. for 1907, p. 1342) operated upon four sisters, while a fifth was similarly treated in a hospital. But when we come to consider the question of heredity we must take into account the frequency of this neoplasm, for it is so common that the fact of its occurring in two or more of a family is by no means inexplicable, quite apai-t from family predis- position. Further, Doran's three patients were <ill above thirty years of age and were all un- married, so that even in this case Pinard's generalisation is of value. The prognosis of uterine fibroids is now held to be graver than it was thought to be some five or ten years ago. This is the result of the greater knowledge which has been obtained of the life-history of these tumours, made possible through more frequent operations. Doubtless in the past death was often ascribed to complications (pulmonary, renal, and cardiac) when it was really due to the uterine myoma. As far back as 1902 the late Dr. Cullingworth {Journ. Obstet. and Gynac. Brit. Emp., i. pp. 3-28, 1902) published an analysis of 100 cases of uterine fibro-myomata in which the con- dition of the tumours and the complications to which they had given rise were verified by operation. Of the 100 cases 89 had been operated on liy abdominal hysterectomy and '9 by myomectomy. Forty-six of the tumours were, so to say, healthy and typical, 2 were unusually vascular and had no capsule, and fifty-two had some form of secondary degenera- tive change. Among the last-named were 27 which showed oedematous and myxomatous change, 18 showing necrotic changes (either necrobiotic or infected), and 5 showing cystic and fibro-cystic degeneration; 1 was myxo- sarcomatous, and 1 was calcareous. Twenty- two cases had complications due directly to the tumour; there were serious peritonitic ad- hesions in 12, hydrosalpinx in 5, a twisted pedicle in 2, dilated ureters and hydronephrosis in 1, etc. The tendency to take a graver view of fibroids of the uterus was much strengthened by these statistics, and more recent articles further bear this out. Piquand {Ann. de gynec. â– et d'obsfef., 2 S. ii. p. 335, 1905) has investi- gated 175 cases of calcified fibroids; in a con- siderable number of these cases (111) no surgical interference took place, and many of the patients died from the fibroid ; 64 patients were operated upon and 12 died (18 per cent, mortality). Obviously, calcification of the fibroid, which was at one time the result hoped for, by no means saves the patient's life; indeed, the operation for its removal would seem to be a specially dangerous one. The " red degeneration " of fibroids has been shown to be due to thrombosis of the blood-vessels, and its occurrence pre- disposes to infection with septic organisms (Lorrain Smith and Shaw, Journ. Obstet. and Gynmc. Brit. Emp., xv. p. 225, 1909). C. P. Noble {Journ. Obstet. and Gynmc. Brit. Emp., X. p. 436, 1906) pleads for earlier operation, and bases his plea on the fact that degenera- tions or complications existed in 1550 out of the 2274 cases (68 per cent.), and that cancer and sarcoma of the uterus occur more frequently than is supposed as complications of fibroids. Piquand {Ann. de gynec. et d'obstet., 2 S. ii. pp. 393, 485, 565, 1905 ; Rev. de gynec. et de c/iir. abd., ix. p. 579, 1905) had also noted this association of malignant growths with fibroids, and had drawn the same conclusion from it; and Winter {Mo'natssch. f. Geburtsh. u. Gyndk., Ivii. pp. 8-66, 1906) thought that there was a direct relation between cancer and uterine myomata. All gynecologists, however, are by no means at one on this subject, and Haultain {Trans. Edin. Obstet. Sac, xxix. p. 173, 1904), for instance, was of opinion that malignant disease was but slightly predisposed to by fibro-myomata, and might be looked upon merely as a coincidence; at the same time, the volume of evidence in favour of the fre- quency of the association of the two morbid states is considerable. Another risk run by the woman who has a fibi'oid growth of the uterus is axial rotation of the tumour or (what is still more dangerous) of the whole uterus. Haultain {Trans. Edin. Obstet. Soc, xxx. p. 197, 1905) has recorded two such cases, and others have been reported by Boursier {Sem. gynec, x. p. 329, 1905), Bland-Sutton {Trans. Obstet. Soc. Lond., xlvi. p. 149, 1905), Lacou- ture {Journ. de med. de Bordeaux, xxxvi. p. 364, 1906) , Cameron {Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1905, p. 714), Pichevin [Sem. gynec, xi. p. 209, 1906), Schultze {Samml. klin. Vortr., N. F., No. 410, 505, 1906), Gayet {Lyon med., cix. p. 272, 1907) , Berard {ibid., ex. p. 374, 1908), Grosse {Gaz. med. de Nantes, 2 S. xxvi. pp. 241, 261, 1908) , Pellet {Normandie med., xxiv. p. 255, 1908), Schulte {Gynaek. Rundschau, ii. p. 729, 1908), and Connell {Journ. Obstet. and Gyncec. Brit. Emp., xvi. p. 184, 1909). When all these risks are borne in mind, it is not wonderful that gynecologists, instead of being afraid to remove the myomatous uterus (as they were some fifteen years ago), are now afraid to leave it unoperated upon. The treatment has varied little during the past few years. The sub-total or supravaginal form of hysterectomy is still the operation of choice, although conservative gynecology demands the performance of simple myomec- tomy (hystero-myomectomy) as often as it is possible to get the neoplasm away without too great a risk. It is becoming customary, also, to try to save one or both ovaries unless these are markedly pathological. It is true that ovarian cysts have sometimes developed after

IV EDITORIAL NOTE " Acute Abdomen," Adams-Stohes's Disease, Addiment, Adenomyoma, Adrenalin, Adrenin, Aeropathy, Agglu- tinogens, Ail- Hunger, Alanin, etc., the reader will find modern medical terms which are constantly being met with in the current literature of his subject, and he will be able, in many cases, to replace a vague notion of their meaning with a clear, concise, and correct conception, which cannot fail to aid him in his study of the weekly and monthly journals to which he has access. It may be of interest if the number of articles— short, medium, and long—in this and in the previous volumes of the work be given here in a tabular form :— Articles. Vol. Scope. Long. Medium Short.

Aba-Zym 96 193 965 1,254 Totals . 705 1061 11,331 13,097 As in previous volumes of tlie Encyclo'pedia and Dictionary, the articles have been written by special- ists in the various departments of medicine, and the more purely dictionarial part of the work has been under editorial supervision. Some illustrations may be given of the way in which this supplementary volume may be turned to the best account. Let us suppose that the reader comes across the expression " infundibidur extract" in his professional reading ; he refers to the fourth volume of the Encyclopedia and Dictionary, but finds no such heading there, for the sufficient reason that the term is younger than the volume ; but now. if he will turn up his supplementary volume, he will discover the name at once, and will be referred to Pituitary Gland, where he will find an account of the action of extracts of that gland (part of which is called the infundibubun, a fact which at once explains the above term) and an indication of the diseases in which they are believed to act beneficially. Again, he may hear a brother practitioner praising or dis- counting the action of some new remedy or pro- prietary preparation ; if he does not find it in its alphabetical place in the first ten volumes, he will in all probability discover it in the supplementary volume, along with such references as will enable him to form an estimate of the opinions which have been expressed regarding its value. Again, he may be listening to an article on some novel aspect of medicine which is being read before a medical or surgical society, or he may be attending post-graduate lectures ; if some years, have elaj^sed since he took his medical qualification, he will probably find terms in constant use which are unknown to him, and indeed may feel almost as if he were listening to a new language {e.g. in the matter of immunity and its theories) ; here, again, this quinquennial volume will facilitate his progress and help him to keep abreast with the times or regain lost ground. Yet again, the reader may wish to have the latest know- ledge regarding therapeutic methods and operative procedures so that his conscience may rest satisfied that he is discharging his full duty to his patients ; at the same time he does not wish to run after every new plan, knowing well that in this way much time may be lost and many fair hopes cherished only to be blighted ; in this work he will find the opinion of specialists provided in order to remove him at least one stage further off the chance of failure and disappointment. It is believed that the numerous illustrations will elucidate, and even in some cases supplement, the text, especially in connection with the details of novel operative procedures. J. W.

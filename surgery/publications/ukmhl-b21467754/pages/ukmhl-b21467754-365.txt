307 PREGNANCY, PATHOLOGY OF be transformed into the grave type and run the course of acute yellow atrophy of the liver. The prognosis, therefore, should always be doubtful. The presence of twins in the uterus (as in the immediately fatal case recorded by IBertino) or of diseases of the blood help to determine hepatic inadequacy in pregnancy, and so change a simple jaundice into the grave type. When the symptoms are well established, ]ieither medical nor obstetrical treatment is of much avail. The hepatic complications of preg- nancy have also been discussed by Biauer {Zentralb. f. Gynak., xxvii. p. 787, 1903), Charles {Journ. d'accouch. (Liege), xxvii. p. 73, 1906) , Kehrer {Arch. f. Gynaek., Ixxxi. p. 129, 1907) , Lulle {Journ. de med. de Paris, 2 s. xviii. p. 201, 1906), Rudaux (Arch. gen. de med., i. for 1905, p. 1191), and Hofbauer (Med. Klin., v. p. 239, 1909). Renal Disorders during Pregnancy.—In addition to their relation to ECLAMPSIA (q.v.), the kidneys may be at fault in pregnancy in other ways. The movable kidney, for instance, may become impacted in the pelvis during pregnancy. Von Guerard {Monatssch. f. Geburtsh. u. Gyndk., xvii. p. 1160, 1903) has recorded such a case : the patient suffered from a fall on the nates, followed by great pain ; a tender mass impacted in the pelvis was dis- •covered on examination ; it was thought to be ovarian, and was reduced under anaesthesia; two months later the same conditions were redeveloped; the abdomen was opened, the tumour (the right kidney) was reduced, and both the Fallopian tubes were ligatured; the patient aborted three hours later. Pyelitis and pyelonephritis may occur as complications of pregnancy. Cumston [Journ. Obstet. and Gyncec. Brit. Emp., viii. p. 221, 190.5) has ably summarised our knowledge on these maladies and has recorded a personal observa- tion of persistent pyuria in which decapsulation of both kidneys was performed but without saving the patient; prior to decapsulation the uterus had been emptied (the gestation was at the sixth month), and, prior to this, ovariotomy had been performed successfully at the fifth month. Opitz {Berl. klin.-therap. Wochensch., p. 1357, 1904), Fournier [Btdl. Soc. d'ohstet. de Paris, viii. p. 9, 1905), Rudaux (Clinique {Bruxelles), xx. p. 522, 1906), Bar and Daunay (Bull. Soc. d'obstet. de Paris, ix. p. 136, 1906), and Esselbruegge (Med. Fortnightly, xxxiii. p. 17, 1908) have made contributions to this •department of the pathology of pregnancy. There have been several important articles on glycosuria in the pregnant state, amongst which may be named those by Rudaux (Cliiiique, i. for 1906, p. 281), Jackson and Torbert (Boston Med. and Surg. Journ., clii. p. 159, 1905), Brook {Trans. Obstet. Soc. Lond., xlviii. p. 192, 1907), Loviot (Rev. d. mal. de la nutrition, 2 s. ii. p. 173, 1904), Eshner (Ajuer. Jour^i. Med. Sci., cxxxiv. p. 375, 1907), and AVilliams (Amer. Journ. Med. Sci., cxxxvii. p. 1, 1909). The Goulstonian Lectures on the influence of pregnancy upon certain medical diseases and of certain medical diseases of pregnancy by Dr. Herbert French (Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1908, pp. 1029, 1100, 1165) are worthy of special consideration ; pyelonephritis and the fevers are specially dealt with. Preparator.—In immunity this term has been employed as a synonym of ambo- ceptor or immune body. Pressor.—Stimulating or exciting, e.g. pressor nerves, are those whose stimulation excites increased vasomotor activity, pressor bases are chemical substances whose retention in the body raises the blood pressure; the antonym is depressor. On pressor bases, see W. Bain, Lancet, ii. for 1909, p. 365 ; i. for 1910, p. 1190. Probilin. — A trade name for phenol- phthalein (q.v.). Proctoclysis.—The giving of rectal saline injections. ProlaminS.—Gliadins or alcohol-soluble proteins; simple proteins insoluble in water or absolute alcohol but soluble in relatively strong alcohol and other neutral solvents ; hordein from barley and zein from maize are prolamins. Propagrative Part.—The name given by Berry Hart to that part of the animal or plant body which is not the soma ; in the adult it is the sexual gland, and in the zygote (fer- tilised ovum) it is the primitive germ or sperm- cell mass. See Berry Hart, Evolution and Heredity, p. 38, 1910. Propepsin.—Pepsinogen, the zymogen which is secreted by the peptic glands, and which is converted by free hydrochloric acid into pepsin. Prophase.—The first stage in mitosis (indirect cell division) during which the nuclear chromatin forms a skein and then divides into chromosomes, the nuclear membrane dis- appears, and the amphiaster appears in the cytoplasm. Propion. — A hypnotic of the ketone group; it is not highly spoken of. Proponai (see also Drugs, Recent).— A hypnotic drug chemically closely allied to veronal and resembling it in its action; the dose is from 2 to 8 grains, and, as it is easily

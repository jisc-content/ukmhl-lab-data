The more closely the natural process of suckling is studied, the less probable does it appeal' that any really satisfactory substitute will ever be found. At the same time, some advances in artificial feeding have been made. Digestion of Casein of Milk.—The views of Van Slyke and Hart are now generally accepted here and in America. The essential point brought out by their work is that the amount of digestion which milk requires depends on the activity of the gastric juices. In the stomach of the newly-born infant it probably undergoes comparatively little diges- tion, and passes quickly into the bowel, where- as in older infants it offers considerable resistance to digestion. Milk stands alone among foods in possessing this quality, which results from the reactions of casein towards rennin and hydrochloric acid. In explaining these reactions the nomenclature of Van Slyke and Hart will be followed. Casein is a proteid which contains phosphorus, and exists in milk in combination with lime as calcium casein (otherwise known as casein- ogen, etc.). On entering the stomach calcium casein is acted on by rennin, hydrochloric acid, and pepsin. Rennin and pepsin exist in the gastric juice from birth ; hydrochloric acid appears soon after birth. Rennin can only act on calcium casein if (as is normally the case) ionisable calcium salts are present in the milk plasma. (To digress for a moment from the main argument, we may here state that the effect of sodium citrate in inhibiting rennin action depends on the power of the citrate to diminish the ionisable calcium.) The first action of rennin is to convert the soluble calcium casein into insoluble calcium para- casein, a soft curd which, in the absence of hydrochloric acid, is not further affected by pepsin, but passes readily into the intestine. If, however, free hydrochloric acid be present in the stomach, it reacts with the calcium paracasein and converts the latter into free paracasein, which is a firmer curd, and is digested by pepsin. If the hydrochloric acid be present in larger amount, a further reaction ensues, paracasein hydrochloride being formed from the free paracasein. This is a denser curd than either of its precursors ; it, also, is digested by pepsin. Several matters of practical interest arise out of the above statement as to the digestion of milk.

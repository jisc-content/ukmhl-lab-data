ECTOPIC PREGNANCY 134 port from the specimen shown by M. von Stranch (/oc. cit., supra), in which the tube showed a deep depression on the outside corre- sponding to the attachment of the placental pedicle on the inside ; and the occasional occur- rence of intussusception of the tube (Mainzer, ZentraJh. f. Gyndk., xxvii. p. 921, 1903 ; Kermauner, Beitrdge zur Anatomie der Tuhen- schtcangerscliaft, 1904) shows that the tubal muscle is active. The exact mechanism of tubal abortion, however, can hardly lie regarded as satisfactorily settled. When complete tubal abortion takes place it is probable that in most cases the tube returns to its normal state and the hfematocele disap- pears gradually. The occurrence of incomplete abortion, however, causes a continuance of the signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy, and the patient probably is sooner or later submitted to operation.

Of the many theories which have from time to time been advanced to explain the occurrence of ectopic gestation, some, such as external or internal wandering of the fertilised ovum, may be dismissed as insufficient to explain the facts, whilst others, such as puerperal atrophy of the tubes (favoured by Diihrssen) and the presence of kinks, must be regarded as very doubtful. Some years ago inflammatory changes in the tube were regarded as the most probable causal agency, and it must still be admitted that salpingitis and ectopic pregnancy coexist too often to be explained away (Ker- mauner, Werth, Gottschalk, and others) ; the increase in the connective tissue of the tube which follows the occurrence of inflammation in an indirect way supports this view. Never- theless, the prevailing theory at the present time seem to be that of antenatal modifications of the tube or the persistence of fostal conditions. It is doubtful, perhaps, whether there is much probability in the view put foi'ward by Freund in 1888 that spiral windings of the tube (the persistence of an infantile state) are of etiological importance ; but the more recent theory of im- plantation of the ovum in a tubal diverticulum (antenatal or acquired) or in an accessory tubal ostium cannot be easily dismissed, and has warm supporters in Micholitsch, Fellner, and Fiith. Indeed the occurrence of diverticular implanta- tion cannot be denied, and the only difference of opinion which can arise is with regard to its being the cause or only one cause of ectopic gestation (Heinsius). There is a general con- sensus of opinion that the chief cause is delay in passage of the ovum through the tube; it may be caught in an accessory ostium or in a diverticulum ; it may be obstructed by a polypus or a spiral folding of the tube; it maybe hin- dered by inflammatorj' adhesions ; or it may have grown to such a size as to prevent its easy transmission. Webster's theory of decidual re- action (1895) as the determining factor cainiot be said to have been strengthened by the dis- covery of genuine cases of ovarian pregnancy. If only a tissue derived from the MuUerian ducts has the power of growing a decidua, then, unless it can be proved that MuUerian tissue may invade the ovaries, it l^ecomes impossible to account for gestation occurring in these glands. Another argument against this atav- istic theory of origin of tubal pregnancy is found in the absence of any animal which nor- mally has tubal pregnancies. It may, however, be found that another theor}^, as j^et little heard of, may be of some importance—the view, namely, that the condition of the ovum itself has some effect in determining the position of its implantation ; the ovum, for instance, may be too large to get through the tube (vSippel) ; twin ova may impede each other's progress (Hitschmann and Lindenthal) ; the ovum maj^ have reached at an earlier date that stage of development in which it can attach itself by the destructive action of its trophoblast, or its progress may have been delayed till that stage was reached (Sippel, 1901); or, again, the ovum may be pathological, and, on that account, maj' adhere more readily to the tubal mucosa. In favour of the last-named theorj' is the observa- tion that the ovaries which have supplied the ova of ectopic pregnancies have frequentl}^ been found to be themselves pathological {e.g. cystic). It cannot, however, l)e claimed for any one theory of etiology that it satisfactorily explains all cases or meets all difficulties. Whether, as has been maintained by Seeligmann {Zentralb. f. Gyndk., xxxi. p. 98-5, 1907) ectopic gestation

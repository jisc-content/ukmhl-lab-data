VENESECTION 397 certainly is contra-indicated in young children, in old people (especially the weak and de- bilitated), in hsemophilia, in grave anaemia, and in marked aortic regurgitation. Burwinkel, however, thinks it may be safely performed in children, the amount of blood withdrawn being 10 c.c. for each year of the child's age. In ordinary cases, in adults, the amount to be withdrawn varies from 6 to 10 or 12 oz., and may in exceptional instances be more. A still wider field for blood-letting seems to be opened up by Dreyer's work, and by Knud Schroeder's researches on its effect upon patients suffering from enteric iever or para- typhoid fever, and upon animals immunised by injections of cultures of Bacilhis coli and Bacillus typhosics; in both instances blood- letting (3 to 20 oz. being taken in the case of the patients) was followed by a rise in the specific agglutinating power of their serum. These results (clinical and experimental) may serve as the scientific explanation of the bene- fits which some physicians have seen following venesection in acute diseases.

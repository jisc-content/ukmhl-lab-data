18 ACCOUCHEMENT FORC^ in which the cervix has been taken up, but in which the convulsions cannot be controlled in other ways, may possibly continue with advan- tage to be treated by emptying the uterus by this method. But, as Ballantyne (Trans. Edin. Obstet. Soc, xxix. p. 99, 1 903-4) pointed out, it is an " exceptional remedy for exceptional con- ditions." Its distal end is a powerful dilator ; at its proximal end, therefore, must be a sensitive hand, an observant eye fixed on the indicator, and a brain alert to note the degree of resistance which experience has found to warrant continued dilatation. " It is an instrument to be worked with the head rather than the hand." The performance of, accouchement force by the knife may take the form of rnulliple deep o-rviral incisions, or that of vaginal Ccesarean section. For both these methods obstetricians are indebted to Diihrssen (see Winckel's Hand- hnch der Geburtshiilfe, B. iii. t. i. p. 609, 1906), although Acconci's claim of pi'iority has been accepted by some. Superficial cervical incisions are no novelty in obstetric practice; but deep incisions were first practised in a systematic way by Diihrssen in 1890 (Arch. f. Gynaek., xxxvii. p. 27). They were four in numberâ€” an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral, and they ran from the margin of the os to the utero- vaginal junction ; they were made with a pair of angular scissors, and it was found to be advantageous to clamp the cervix with long catch-forceps on each side of the incision (De Lee, Internal. Clinics, 16 s. i. p. 147, 1906). The operation thus introduced has been fre- quently practised, more especially in cases of eclampsia and accidental haemorrhage ; it should be restricted to the cases in which effacement of the cervix has already been secured, and the incision should be closed with sutures immedi- ately after the birth is completed. The danger is extension of the cuts during extraction, with consequent conversion of a cervical incision into a uterine rupture. Partly on this account, and partly for other reasons, Diihrssen in 1895 described and recommended the operation of vaginal Casa.rean section or vaginal hysterotomy (to use a less aml^iguous designation), and in 1896 published his work on the subject {Der Vaginale Kaiserschnift, Karger, Berlin). Several years, however, elapsed before the opei'ation was received with any favour; indeed, it was hardly known among English-speaking obstetri- cians till Stamm, in November 1903 (Arner. Journ. Obstet., xlviii. p. 595, 1903), and Munro Kerr, in January 1904 (Trans. Edin. Obstet. Soc, xxix. p. 68, 1903-4), introduced it to American and British practice respectively. But during the preceding years there had been several Continental contributions to the discussion regarding the value of and indications for this new obstetric procedure. Recommended at first in cases of cancer of the cervix uteri in pi-egnancy (Diihrssen, Zentralbl. f. Gynlilc, xxi. p. 942, 1897; Mittermaier, ibid., xxii. p. 5, 1898; SeifFart, ibid., xxii. p. 121, 1898; and others, ibid., xxiii. pp. 572, 670, 816, 856, 1287 ; xxiv. pp. 69, 933, 1357, etc.), it was ere long extended to other morbid states, such as eclampsia, hyperemesis gravidarum, serious heart disease in pregnancy, and indeed to all those states in which rapid emptying of the gravid uterus was called for, and in which the cervix was undilated and not easily dilatable. In 1901, for instance, Diihrssen (Zentralbl. f. Gyndk., xxv. p. 33, 1901) was using the vaginal Csesarean section in eclampsia; in 1902 Jahreiss (ibid., xxvi. p. 919) employed it in two cases of eclampsia; whilst Bumm (ibid., xxvi. p. 1417, 1902) used it in chorea, nephritis, heart disease, eclampsia, cancer of the cervix, and for the induction of premature labour in thirteen cases, with one maternal death. Ehrendorfer (Zen- tralbl. f. Gyndk., xxvii. p. 483, 1903) employed it in hyperemesis gravidarum; Riihl (ibid., xxvii. p. 1044, 1903) brought it into action in marked rigidity of the cervix; and further cases of eclampsia treated in this way wei-e reported (ibid., xxvii. pp. 488, 1367, 1903). It would, perhaps, more quickly have attracted the atten- tion of obstetricians had it not been that about this time (1903) accouchement force by means of the Bossi dilator was highly favoured; perhaps, also, Diihrssen did not practise modera- tion in the way he stated his arguments. But since 1903 no obstetric operation has been more extensively discussed. Thus the Zentralblatt far Gyndkologie for 1904 contained fourteen original articles by Riihl, Westphal, Ahlfeld, Diihrssen, Kroemer, Steffeck, Maly, Kermauner, Hammerschlag, Kronig, and M'^anner; and its sphere was extended so as to include placenta prsevia. Uthmoller (ibid., xxx. p. 306, 1906) performed the operation in private practice for eclampsia; andZarate (i62W., xxxi.p. 1625, 1907) did it for the first time in South America, the indication being laryngeal stenosis. In other countries contributions appeared from the pens of Webster (Amer. Journ. Obstet., xlix. p. 810, 1904) , Bacon (ibid., 1. p. 488, 1904), Jerie (Casop. lek. cesk, xliii. p. 1168, etc., 1904), Miller (New Oii. Med. and Surg. Journ., Ivii. p. 551, 1904-5), Mainzer (Deutsch. med. Wochensclir., xxxi. p. 266, 1905) , Strauss (Med. Eee. (New York), Ixvii. p. 417, 1905), C. Van de Poll (Med. Weekbl, xi. p. 575, 1904-5), H. D. Fry (Surg. Gynec. and Obsfet., i. p. 58, 1905), Fabre (Lyon med., cvii. p. 604, 1906), Bar (Ilev. gen. de din. et de ihc'rap., xxi. p. 769, 1907), Bi'ewis (Scot. Med. and Surg. Journ., xxi. p. 226, 1907), Knvnicki (Przegl. lek., xlvi. p. 471, 1907), Saks (Medycyna, xxxv. p. 644, 1907), and H. D. Fry (Amer. Journ. Obstet., lix. p. 202, 1902). Indeed, had it not been for the discussion which arose in regard to pubi- otomy, and which diverted obstetric interest in another direction, the operation of vaginal Cffisarean section might still have been the

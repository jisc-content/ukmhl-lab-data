PUERPERIUM, MANAGEMENT OF 318 a,larin." The cause for alarm has been provided by Fromme's recorded case. It may be found that a careful combination of systematic exercises in the horizontal posture •during the early days of the puerperium, with rising not at the third, but about the seventh or eighth day, will give the best method of managing the puerperium ; and Ballantyne has, during the autumn quarter of the past two years (1909- 10), used such a combination- treatment at the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital in more than 200 cases. Pu I motor.—A means of resuscitating by artificial respiration persons apparently dead from drowning, carbonic acid, gas poisoning (in mines), chloroform poisoning, etc. ; it is known as the " Draesfcr " Automatic Pulmotor. Purdy's Method. — The use of the centrifuge in determining the amount of chlorides, phosphates, sulphates, and albumin in urine. See Webster, Diagnostic Methods, pp. 186, 193, 199, and 259, 1909. Purdy's Solution.—A modification of Fehling's solution for the quantitative estima- tion of glucose in urine. The formula is : chemically pure copper sulphate, 4,752 grams; potassium hydrate, 23,500 grams; strong CP. ammonia (sp. gr. 0'88), 350,000 c.c.; glycerine, 38,000 c.c. ; and distilled water q.s. ad 1,000,000 ■c.c. See Webster, Diagnostic Methods, p. 283, 1909. Purg'a.tin.—A purgative drug, the diace- tate of anthrapurpurin (trioxyanthraquinone), forming a tasteless powder insoluble in water but soluble in alkaline solution ; its ingestion is followed by the appearance of a reddish-brown pigment in the urine ; the dose is from 8 to 15 grains; it is also known as purgatol. See Fortescue-Brickdale, Newer Remedies, p. 74, 1910. Purg^atol.—See PURGATIN. Purg'elin.—A trade name for phenol- phthalein (g.v.). Purg^ella..—A trade name for phenol- phthalein {q.v.). Purg^en.—A trade name for phenol- phthalein {q-v.). Purg^O.—A trade name for phenol- phthalein (q.v.). Purg'Ola.de.—A trade name for phenol- phthalein (q-v.). Purg^ylum.—A trade name for phenol- phthalein (q.v.). Purinometer.—An apparatus for esti- mating the amount of purins in urine. Purins {see also Artbrio-Sclerosis ; Diet (Purin-Free)).—-The purin bodies are diureides, substances consisting of two un- modified or modified urea molecules, linked together by an acid nucleus, and in the case of the purin bodies in particular the linking molecule is an oxi-acid with three carbons in series. They are all derived from purin (C5H4N), or have it as their nucleus (Adami, Pathology, i. pp. 375 flf., 1910). The most important of them is uric acid, whose con- stitution (as above described) may be thus represented :— 0 H—N—C 0 = 0 0—N—-H II >C = 0; H—N—0—N<—H or more briefly- HN—00 I I 00 0—NH^ I II HN—0—NH^ CO. Uric acid is really trioxypurin ; and other purin bodies are purin itself, which may be represented thus:— N = OH HO C—NH. II II > N—0 — N ^ and dioxypurin or xanthin :• HN—CO o'c 0—NH. I II > HN—C— N <^ CH, CH. Then there are purins which act as diuretics, and which are derived from xanthin by the introduction of methyl (OH;j) groups. There is, for instance, dimethylxanthin, which is theobromine or theophylline (theocin) accord- ing to the relative position of the methyl groups in the molecule. There is also trime- thylxanthin or caflfeine. These purins along with certain double salts of theobromine {e.g. agurin, diuretin, etc.) have been used as diuretics. See Theobromin, Theophyllin, Theolactin, etc. The purins are supposed to play a large part in the production of gout, and it is interesting that from them so many valuable diuretic drugs should be obtained. Pycnometer.—An instrument for deter- mining the specific gravity of liquids such as urine and blood (Gr. tux^o's, thick) ; it is weighed

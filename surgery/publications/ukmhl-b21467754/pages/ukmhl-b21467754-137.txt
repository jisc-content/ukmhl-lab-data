CHOREA 103 to obviate this risk the following rules must be adhered to:—(1) Enough bicarbonate of soda must be given along with the sodium salicylate to keep the urine alkaline. For this purpose it is customary to give twice as much bicarbonate as salicylate. (2) Constipation must be pre- vented ; the bowels should act freely every day. (3) Careful watch should be kept for any symptoms of salicylate poisoning, especially for a peculiar deep inspiration resembling the " air- hunger " of diabetes. If this occurs, the salicy- late should be stopped, and the bicarbonate increased. For a child aged six to ten years Lees advises that the dose should be at first 10 grs. of salicylate with 20 grs. of bicarbonate ; after two or three days the quantities should be raised to 15 grs. and 30 grs. respectively, and after another two or three days to 20 grs. and 40 grs. Ten doses are given in the twenty-four hours —two hourly by day, three hourly by night. The unpleasant symptoms occasionally caused by salicylate on adults—deafness, singing in the ears, delirium—are rare in childhood. Vomiting- is sometimes troublesome, but may be overcome by intermitting the treatment for a day or two. Heart failure is due to rheumatic dilatation of the left ventricle, not to the drug, and " general depression " is usually absent. In many cases this method of treatment yields extremely good results : the choreic move- ments speedily cease, and the patient puts on weight steadily. The risk of acid intoxication, which undoubtedly exists, can to a very large extent be prevented by attention to the re- action of the urine and the state of the bowels. It is, however, obvious that these large doses of salicylate can only be used with safety if the child is under constant medical supervision; " air-hunger " may develop rapidly, and unless it is at once recognised and the salicylate with- drawn, disaster may follow. In a discussion on the subject at the British Medical Association meeting of 1903, the late Dr. Ashby confessed that he was afraid of giving such large doses as Dr. Lees recommends, and thought that more moderate doses—40 to 60 grs. daily—would do as much as the large ones, with less risk. Langmead has reported a series of cases of acid intoxication from sodium salicylate. The urine of the patients contained acetone and diacetic acid (nitro-prusside test) ; oxybutyric acid was not examined for. The main facts are as tabulated :— Case. Age. Dose of salicylate per 24 hours. Total quantity of salicylate before acidosis developed. Duration of treatment.

(1) Hippus. This is often difficult to detect, because the rapid jerking movements of the eyes allow a constantly vary- ing amount of light to fall on the retina, and in consequence the pupils perpetually alter in size. True hippus, however, can sometimes be ob- served. (2) The movements of accommodation are sometimes asymmetrical, particularly when the pupils are unequal, one pupil contracting to accommodation while the other remains dilated. (3) Contraction to light and accommodation unequal on the two sides. (4) Variable irre- gularity of the pupils, one being larger than the other at one time, and smaller at another. (5) Eccentricity of the pupils. Similar ocular changes have also been described by R. W. Philip. Septicemic Chorea. —Sachs reports two fatal cases of acute chorea with endocarditis and septicaemia—staphylococcus aureus in one case and streptococcal in the other : several other cases seen in hospital and private practice are referred to. He proposes the following classifi- cation of chorea :—(1) Chorea with no evidence of any infection. (2) Rheumatic chorea. (3) Chorea gravidarum. (4) Senile chorea. (5) Septicsemic chorea.

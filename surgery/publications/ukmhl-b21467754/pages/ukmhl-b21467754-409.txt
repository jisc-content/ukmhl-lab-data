SURGERY, ASEPSIS IN 351 sterilised gauze or lint, soaked in carbolic solu- tion (1 in 60), is placed in position and kept there by waterproof tissue and bandage until the time of the operation, when it is removed and the skin surface again gone over with ether and one of the alcoholic antiseptic solu- tions (mentioned above) and dried by sterilised pledgets. Of recent years the tincture of iodine method has been coming to the front. It was em- ployed by A. Grossich of Fiume in 1908 (Vor- Idujige Mitteilung. Zentralbl. f. Chir., xxxv. p. 1289, 1908), and F. J. W. Porter {Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1909, p. 332, 1909) reported favourably upon it, using a 10 per cent, spirituous solution. Professor von Eiselsberg of Vienna was making use of it in 1907 {Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1909, p. 439). Waterhouse has written on this subject {Lancet, i. for 1910, p. 1063; Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1910, p. 61). He found some years ago that soaking catgut (as it came from the manufacturer) for a week in a solution of 1 part of iodine to 500 of equal parts of rectified spirit and water sufficed to make it sterile; thereafter he combined the washing of the skin with soap and water and the painting of it with tincture of iodine, but did not get better results than with ordinary methods ; then he suspected that the prelimi- nary washing with soap and water might pre- vent the tincture of iodine penetrating between the swollen epithelial cells. So he abandoned the washing with soap and water and simply painted the skin with an alcoholic solution of iodine. At first he used unnecessarily strong solutions (8 or 6 per cent.), and finally he decided on a 2 per cent, solution in rectified (not in methylated) spirit; sometimes tincture of iodine was used, and occasionally a 2 per cent, solution of iodine in chloroform. By this method the preparation of the skin of the opera- tion-area is begun much nearer the time fixed for the operation, a great saving of labour to the nurse and a sparing of the feelings of the patient. Of course the skin is shaved and washed first; then time enough to allow it to dry elapses ; then the iodine solution is painted on; two hours later, when the patient is on the table, the painting is repeated ; the surgeon may then begin his operation. There are two slight inconveniences: the skin is rendered more vascular, the wound bleeding more than usual; and knives are a little blunted ; but the ad- vantages are many and obvious. Other pre- parations of iodine have been used ; thus A. J. Wallace, after abandoning iodine acetone (on account of its irritating, pungent odour), found iodine-dichloride-ethylene solution (248 per cent.) to give excellent results, especially in abdominal work {Practitioner, p. 501, April 1910; Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1910, p. 1288). J. Lionel Stretton, who had in 1909 {Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1909, p. 368) reported on 57 operation cases in which the skin was prepared by being painted with tincture of iodine (B.P.) without previous bath, scrubbing, or shaving, gave details of 291 further cases in 1910 {Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1910, p. 1350). Many recent contributions have been made to the subject, including articles by Routier {Bull, et mem. Soc. de chir. de Paris, n. s., xxxiv. p. 1251, 1908), Walther {ibid., xxxv. pp. 345, 394, 1909), Estor {Montpel. med., xxviii. p. 553, 1909), Gley {Presse mid., xvii. p. 506, 1909), Jewett {Med. Bee, Ixxxi. p. 271, 1909), Lucas- Charapionniere {Journ. de mid. et chir. prat., Ixxx. p. 561, 1909), Grekow {Arch. f. klin. Chir., xc. p. 1073, 1909), Ortali {Gazz. d. osped., XXX. p. 1258, 1909), Pichevin {Semaine gynec, xiv. p. 361, 1909), Stone {Surg., Gynec, and Obst., X. p. 216, 1910), and others. Preparation of the Operator.â€”The prepara- tion of his hands is the operator's chief con- cern ; but before that matter is discussed, it may be M'ell to refer to two or three other things. There seems to be no doubt that the surgeon should wear a sterilised cap of linen or gauze; and it is a wise precaution for the anaesthetist to do the same, as instruments or ligatures which are being handed to the operator may come in contact with the head of the man who is giving chloroform. Whether a face mask should likewise be worn is an open question ; but a fair compromise may perhaps be found in covering the mouth with a gauze pad which can be tied over the ears and back of the neck. The coat, waistcoat, and collar are removed, and a waterproof apron (without sleeves) is put on ; over this the operator wears a sterilised jacket, coat, or gown, the sleeves of which can either be i-olled up to the elbows or fastened at the wrists. Some enthusiasts wear rubber boots which have been steamed, but Treves and Hutchinson {Manual of Operative Surgery, i. p. 33, 1909) place this procedure alongside of the reported precaution which one surgeon is said to have taken of having his carriage wheels washed over with ether and carbolic solution! All are agreed that whether the operator intends to wear gloves or not his hands should be most carefully cleansed. The plans re- commended in the Encyclopedia and Dic- tionary of Medicine (Vol I. p. 293, 1906) are still in common use; but some operators {e.g. Stretton, Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1910, p. 1351) are feeling their way towards a pre- paration of the hands with some chemical agent such as tincture of iodine which shall cut short the long and elaborate scrubbings and soakings in vogue. If iodine be used, the stain can be removed by washing in a 3 per cent, solution of carbolic or a 1 per cent, solution of cyllin. Here may be given the details of scrubbing and disinfecting the hands of operator, assistants, and nurses as employed by Kelly of Baltimore.

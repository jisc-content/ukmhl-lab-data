393 UTERUS, NON-MALIGNANT TUMOURS OF the removal of the fibroid uterus, and Broun (Amer. Journ. Obstet., lix. p. 307, 1909) has ascribed these tumours to the disturbance of the circulation following hysterectomy; hut it is not generally felt that the danger is a great one. Frequent performance of the sub-total hysterectomy has led to a simplification of the procedure, and a lessening of the mortality directly due to the operation. In 1903 Haul- tain {Trans. Edin. Obstet. Soc, xxviii. p. 128, 1903) reported 42 cases of uterine myoma treated by myomectomy or by hysterectomy (panhysterectomy in 3 cases, supravaginal in 28) with 1 death (in one of the panhysterectomies); in 1905 his list contained 120 hysterectomies with 3 deaths (ibid., xxx. p. 105, 1905), and in 1906, 203 supravaginal operations with 2 deaths (Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1906, p. 233); and he has recently {Trans. Edin. Obstet. Soc, xxxii. p. 121, 1907) put on record 30 cases of cervical fibroids removed by abdominal hysterectomy with 3 deaths. Other operators have been able to report similarly good results, and Noble (Kelly and Noble's Gynecology and Abdominal Surgery, i. p. 711, 1907) has gathered together statistics which show that supravaginal hystero- myomectomy has a mortality, in uncomplicated cases, of 1 per cent., in average cases of from 2 to 4 per cent, and in seriously complicated cases of 10, 20, or 30 per cent. ; that myo- mectomy in strictly selected cases has a mortality of about 3 per cent., and of about 5 per cent, when the selection is not so strict; and that total hysterectomy may be said roughly to be nearly twice as dangerous as the supra- vaginal operation. Thus, in Kelly's clinic there were 306 myomectomies with 14 deaths '(4'5 per cent.), and 691 hysteromyomectomies with 22 deaths (3-1 per cent.). Werder {Amer. Journ. Obstet., liv. p. 736, 1906) had 118 operations with 1 death, Webster 100 with 3 deaths, Bland-Sutton 100 consecutive hysterec- tomies for fibroids with no death {Journ. Obstet. ■and GyncBc. Brit. Emp., xiii. p. 328, 1908), and Noble 115 with no death at all (the 115 opera- tions consisting of 104 abdominal sections and 11 vaginal myomectomies). This is a marvel- lous achievement of gynecology: it is not much more than twenty years ago since Keith abandoned hysterectomy for Apostoli's electrical method of treatment on account of the mortality of the former procedure, and now hystero- myomectomy has a mortality as small or smaller than Keith himself obtained in his wonderful ovariotomy lists. In this relation Vanderveer's article on evolution in the history and treatment of uterine fibroids {Amer. Journ. Obstet., lix. p. 169, 1909) may be studied with interest. So much has the attitude of the profession altered in respect to uterine fibroids that C. H. L. Reed {Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1906, p. 1197) has made the general statement that the menopause is a poor surgeon, and that the only safe place for a fibroid of the uterus, however small or large, however soft or hard, however recent or old, is outside the patient's body. The only cases in which operation may be postponed or omitted are those in which the tumour does not cause bleeding, or exert pressure, or exhibit signs of infection or malig- nancy, or which has ceased to grow. Of course, the presence of a complication which would make operation as dangerous as the tumour would also lie a cause for consideration, delay, or abandonment of operative interference. There are still unsettled questions, e.g. the advisability of early rising after operation for fibroid tumours (see Brothers's article in the Medical Record of New York, Ixxi. p. 476. 1907 ; and C. Hartog's in the Zentralb. f. Gyndk., xxxi. p. 1610, 1907), the method of closing the abdominal incision (through and through sutures, or by layers), the direction (vertical, transverse, curvilinear) of the ab- dominal incision (see Maylard, Brit. Med. Journ., ii. for 1907, p. 895), and the fate and value of belated ovaries (Bland-Sutton, ibid., ii. for 1908, p. 10 ; Doleris, Ann. de gyne'c. et d'obstet., 2 S. iv. p. 641, 1907); but the broad principles of the operation are all well established, with the result that what was a dangerous procedure in 1896 has now a mortality (in the hands of practised gynecologists) of less than 2 per cent. Uterus, Prolapsus and Retro- deviations of.—No very marked advances in the treatment of uterine displacements fall to be recorded as having been made during the past five or six years since the articles in the E^icyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine (VII. p. 384 ; X. p. 327) appeared. In 1904 Bantock {Trans. Edin. Obstet. Soc, xxx. p. 34, 1904-5) wrote in defence of the pessary as a means of treating uterine displace- ments ; and challenged the statements made by Macnaughton Jones and Giles {Med. Press and Circ, N. S. Ixxvii. p. 439; Ixxviii. p. 1, 1904) as to the dangers of such supports, and the allegation that they were necessary evils. He spoke in strong terms of the " mania for surgical interference which characterises the present-day gynecology," and was of opinion that "for a case of uncomplicated retroversion in which the uterus is perfectly mobile and capable of being raised into its normal position, either bimanu- ally or by means of the sound . . . the only legitimate treatment is that by a properly adapted pessary." He thought, also, there was a prospect of cure in a large majority of the cases; and he preferred Britannia or white metal as the material out of which the pessary should be made, for the shape could be easily altered and retained, the presence of an irritat- ing muco-purulent discharge was indicated by blackening of the metal, and it was easily

BLADDER, FEMALE 63 formation of a vesico-vaginal fistula well in front of the cervix in the anterior vaginal fornix (vaginal cystotomy); the bladder is to be distended first, and the operation carried out with the patient in the knee-chest position, the incision being made from the vaginal aspect with the aid of sight. The inconvenience re- sulting from the urinary incontinence, which necessarily accompanies this procedure, may be obviated, as Hunner {op. cit.) suggests, by the tub-bath with constant bladder irrigation. In very severe cases excision of the diseased mucous membrane may be required. Among recent contributions to the literature of cystitis in the female the following articles may be named :— 1.

Blastoma. — The term hlastoma (Gr. ^AacTTos, a bud) has had at least two different meanings given to it. At one time it meant a neoplasm (granuloma) produced by the action of a germ or micro-organism, but nowadays it is used to signify a neoplasm arising from cells of the embryo, or rather of its chorionic sac or of the antecedent germ, included in the tissues of the individual. Of late Adami (Pathology, vol. i. pp. 650, 667, etc., 1910) has given it a wider significance still, for he regards all autonomous tumours (neo- plasms proper) as being of two kinds, the teratomas and the blastomas. This extension depends, of course, upon the acceptance of the view that all these tumours are due to the aberrant growth of cells (totipotential or uni- potential) of the individual. Since the terato- mata constitute a comparatively small group, it follows that the blastomata comprise most the tumour growths. The teratoma is dis- tinguished from the blastoma as developing from totipotential cells, i.e. from cells capable of giving rise to the individual, from cells, that is, which possess the power of giving origin to cells of every order. Such a totipotent cell is, of course, the impregnated ovum, but others are found in the primordial blastomeres, in the primitive germinal area cells, in the "growing point" cells of the germinal area, and in the germinal blastomeres. The blastoma develops, on the other hand, from a unipotential cell, a cell which represents only one tissue, and Adami places the long list of ordinary tumours (papil- lomas, epitheliomas, adenomas, carcinomas, endo- theliomas, neuromas, fibromas, lipomas, chon- dromas, osteomas, myomas, angiomas, sarcomas, etc.) under the heading of the blastomas or blastomata. He has had, however, to concede a third (intermediate) group or division, which he terms the teratoblastomata, to include certain " mixed tumours," in whose substance all the three layers of the blastoderm are not repre- sented ; these are derived, according to the theory, from pluri- or multi-potential cells, i.e. from cells capable of giving rise to some of the tissues which normally arise from one or tAvo layers of the blastoderm. Outside these groups of tumours proper are the cysts, which really have nothing in common with the neoplasms except the solitary fact that they cause swellings. The relations of the blastomas to the teratomas and teratoblastomas are set out in the following schematic arrange- ment by Adami ^ (op. cit. p. 667). L Teratoma: a tumour derived from cells capable of giving rise to all the tissues of the individual (totipotential cells). A. Twin teratoma (geminal or heter- ochthonous), e.g. foetal inclusion. B. Filial teratoma (or autochthonous), due to the segregation and sub- sequent growth of totipotential cells of the individual. (1) From non-germinal blasto- meres, e.g. epignathus, congenital sacral tera- toma. (2) From germinal cells: (a) from aberrant germinal blastomeres, e.g. spor- adic teratoma of cran- ium, etc.; (b) from un- reduced ovarian and testicular germ cells, e.g. ovarian and testi- cular teratomas. IL Teratoblastoma : a tumour (autochthon- ous) derived from pluri- or multi- potential cells of the individual; a mixed tumour. A. Diphyllic, containing derivatives of two germinal layers, e.g. certain pai'otid and renal mixed tumours. 1 This differs from the scheme given by the same writer in 1901 (vide Brit. Med. Journ., i. for 1901, p. 623).

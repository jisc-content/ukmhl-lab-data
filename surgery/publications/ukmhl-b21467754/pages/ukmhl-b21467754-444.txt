384 TYPHOID FEVER states that the mortality with his serum has been only 4-3 per cent., as opposed to a mortality in the other Paris hospitals of 177. Diuresis.—Gushing and Clarke,'^^ and other American physicians la,y great stress on giving large quantities of water to typhoid-fever patients. They urge the patients to drink 4 ozs. of water every quarter of an hour, and try to give from 8 to 14 pints in the course of twenty-four hours. Marked polyuria is established as a result of this copious drinking. Both the severity and the mortality of the disease are said to be diminished under this treatment.

Tyramine. — A vaso-constrictor sub- stance, having the formula CoH^NO, found in the watery extract of ergot; it is also a de- composition product of tyrosin its action resembles that of adrenin but is slower and weaker; the dose hypodermically is grain. See Fortescue-Brickdale, Newer Reme- dies, p. 130, 1910. Tyrosinase.—See Ochronosis. Ultramicroscopy. — a method of examining minute bodies in which no light reaches the eye of the observer except the rays which are reflected from the object looked at; there are various plans for carrying out this principle, such as the dark-ground con- denser with a central stop, the Siedentopf ultramicroscope in which the direct rays transmitted through the object are cut oft" in the objective, etc. See Paul Gastou's work, V Ultramicroscope, Paris, 1910. Unna-Tanzer Stain. — An orcein stain for elastic tissue, e.g. in sputum. Uramine.—A trade name for urotropin. Ur-a-SOi.—A formaldehyde derivative, which acts as an intestinal antiseptic. Ureonfietei*.—An instrument used for the estimation of urea in urine, e.g. the Dore- mus ureometer or its modification by Hinds; the hypobromite of soda solution is used, and the amount of nitrogen evolved when it comes in contact with the urine is measured, and the urea estimated in accordance therewith. See Webster, Diagnostic Methods, pp. 210-212, 1909. Ureters, Surgery of.—The surgery of the ureters is of comparatively recent develop- ment. Experience has shown that the ureteral tissues unite well when sutured, and, in conse- quence, a number of surgical procedures— suture, anastomosis, and implantation of the ureters into other viscera haA'e come into vogue. Ureterotomy.—When an impacted calculus is present, it may be removed by incision and subsequent suture of the ureter. Brewer {Amer. Journ. Med. Sci., May 1908) recom- mends an 8-inch incision parallel to Poupart's ligament, splitting of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and division of the internal oblique and transversalis. The peri- toneum is then separated from the iliac fascia and side of the pelvis. The wound in the ureter is sutured with chromic catgut. As some leakage of urine may occur, it is advisable to drain. Woolsey (Annals of Surgery, 1909, xlix. p. 674), in dealing with calculi in the pelvic ureter, thinks it is advisable first to localise them exactly by opening the peritoneum and palpat- ing the ureter. The peiitoneum is closed before proceeding further with the operation. In con- sidering the question of operation in ureteral calculi, the calculus should be given a chance of being passed, provided it is not too large, has not been long impacted, and that there is no infection. The size and progress of the calculus are determined by X-rays. Rubber drainage tubes are dangerous on account of the possibility of their eroding large vessels ; cigarette or rubber tissue drains are preferable. Suttire of Ureters.—Wounds of the ureters may be unavoidable in pelvic operations, especially when it is bound to its sheath by inflammatory adhesions, or infiltration of new growth. When it is completely divided, and a channel for the escape of urine remains, a fistula, which has little or no tendency to cure, develops. On the other hand, as the result of division, the ureter may be occluded, which causes dilatation above the block, and con- secutive injury to the kidney substance. The urine from a cut ureter is liable to infiltrate the planes of cellular tissue in the pelvis, or to escape into the peritoneal cavity, according to circumstances. When the ureteral canal is perAaous, longitudinal incisions heal readily, with little escape of urine into the tissues. Apart from actual division at the time of operation, the ureter may be injured hy the

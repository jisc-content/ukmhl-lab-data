Having concluded the consideration of the pathology of the different forms of aneurism, and the general principles on which our treatment of them is to be conducted, I now proceed to speak of special aneurisms, or aneurisms of particular arteries, commencing with those of the neck and upper extremity. Aneurisms of the Innominate Artery are not uncommon, but owing to their anatomical relations and peculiarities, they are seldom suited for surgical interference. These conditions render the diagnosis difficult, and the treatment uncertain. We cannot be quite sure that the innominate artery is affected, and the aorta not; and, even should we tie the vessel on the distal side of the aneurism—namely, the right carotid and right subclavian—which is the only treatment possible, there is not very much chance of the disease being cured. Then an aneurism of the innominate artery seldom exists without a portion of the arch of the aorta being involved in the disease. Thus the chances are that the disease will be aggravated rather than relieved by our interference. Still a cure has been obtained occasionally. Mr. Wardrop once tied the right subclavian and right carotid arteries at different times for aneurism of the innominate, and with a successful result. The only chance we can give the patient is to tie the vessels on the distal side of the aneurism. First, tie the right

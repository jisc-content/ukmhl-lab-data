274 DISEASES OF BONES. from disease or injury. We see this well exemplified in the cases termed " cario-necrosis" of the tarsal bones, where, under excited action increasing the imperfect plastic exudation, the denser shell dies rapidly, and exfoliates, whilst the looser cancellated part loses its vitality more slowly, presenting at some points the molecular disintegration or ulceration, at others deposition of new material, leading to the condensation of the texture, as described by Professor Goodsir. In some cases we have this also exemplified in a general disease of the shaft and epiphyses simultaneously, as in the specimen of the femur already alluded to. As to practice, these views will modify our prognosis. Thus, whilst they show why the diseased condition is generally more persistent and intractable when it occurs in the cancellated texture, they also point out how, in some cases of caries, by a process of molecular death, the imhealthy surface of bone may occasionally be disintegrated, thrown off, and so a cure be obtained. They explain the reasons why the cure in strumous necrosis of the shaft is generally so tedious, and often imperfect, even after the removal of all sequestra, and also the tendency to affections of the articulations supervening both from direct extension of disease and from constitutional diathesis. Lastly, they show us the necessity for patience in the treatment after the re- moval of large sequestra, and for the careful and persistent use of constitutional remedies.

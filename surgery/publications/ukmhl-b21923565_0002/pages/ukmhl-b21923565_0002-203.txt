Fractures and Dislocations of the Lower Extremity—Dislocation of the Hip- Joint—On the Dorsum Ilii—Into the Sciatic Notch—Into the Obturator Foramen—On the Pubis—Diagnostic Symptoms and Methods of Treatment. We shall now proceed to discuss tlie fractures and disloca- tions of the lower extremity, commencing in this instance with the dislocations :— *The Dislocations of the Hip-Joint are four in number— two backwards, one downwards, and one forwards and slightly upwards. The two first are dislocation upwards and backwards on the dorsum of the ilium, and backwards and slightly upwards into the greater ischiatic notch. We shall consider these in the order of their frequency. In dislocation of the head of the femur on the dorsum of the ilium, the knee and foot are turned inwards, the trochanter is felt further back and higher up than usual, and the head of the femur lies on the dorsum of the ilium. This is the most common of all the dislocations of the hip. There is shortening of the injured limb to the extent of one or two inches at least. The knee is inverted, the foot rests on the upper part of the tarsus of the opposite foot, and there is a great bulging at the hip from the projection of the trochanter. There should be little difficulty in diagnosing this dislocation, as there is only one fracture for which it can be mistaken, and that is more likely to be confounded with a dislocation of the head of the femur into the ischiatic notch. Dislocation of the head of the femur into the greater ischiatic notch is somewhat rare. It sometimes occurs as a secondary dislocation when we are reducing the one already spoken of, or

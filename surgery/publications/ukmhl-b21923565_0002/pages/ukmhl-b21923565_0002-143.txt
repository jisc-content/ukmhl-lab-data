345 FRACTURE. different directions from the action of other nuiscles. In fracture of the neck of the femur the foot has a tendency to fall outwards ; this is not owing merely to active muscular causes, but also to the normal condition, for when a person is lying down the limb falls to the outside naturally ; and in cases of fracture, when the continuity of the bone is broken, the same tendency exists, though somewhat increased by certain muscular causes. In the general treatment of fracture, the retentive ap- paratus should be so applied that we can examine the parts from time to time, without displacing the splints or moving the limb. For this purpose the splints are generally put on with a sheet or slip-knots, for if we use the continuous roller, we must undo the whole apparatus whenever we want to examine the Hmb. At first the patient should be put on low diet, and opiates and febrifuge remedies administered to allay any pain or fever; but we should take care not to disturb him much by giving purgatives. We should keep the bowels open by diet rather than by medicine, for any undue moving of the patient is always injurious. After a time we should give better diet than usual; in some cases stimulants are necessary. Many sur- geons adopt the plan of putting up fractures in starch or plaster- of-Paris at first, but I have great objections to this, for when it is used we cannot examine the limb readily when we want to do so. Besides, when we set the limb, and pu.t a starched bandage on it, it fits very well at the time, but as the swelling diminishes the bandage becomes loose, and we cannot tell what is going on beneath. The starch bandage looks very pretty, but when it is taken down we may find that the fracture is by no means so well set as if the more simple apparatus had been em- ployed.

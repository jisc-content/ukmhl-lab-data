TREATMENT OF GELATINOUS DEGENERATION. 311 of cases which have been operated on. Again, by careful ex- amination of the general health of such patients, we will often, by delaying operation and preparing them, give our operations a better chance of success ; and we will also be guided as to the nature of the operation to be performedâ€”as, for example, in deciding between excision or amputation. In regard to disease of the lungs, unless the disease be far advanced, we ought, as a general rule, to operate. I believe that the joint-disease is a source of great irritation and debility, and that by amputation we relieve the patient of a diseased condition, procure rest, allow nutrition to be carried on, and so arrest, or at least palli- ate, the lung-disease. I have so frequently seen consumptive patients, who were suffering from gelatinous degeneration of the knee, regain strength and flesh, with marked amelioration of the chest-symptoms, after an operation, that, as I have said, unless the disease be very far advanced, I never hesitate to give the patient the chance afforded by amputation, and the recoveries in such cases from the operation are usually very rapid. As to the dread which formerly existed, that the local disease acted as a sort of counter-irritant, and that its removal would be followed by more rapid development of the disease of the lungs, I can only say, that after a very considerable experience in such cases, I have always found amputation followed by amelioration, not exacerbation, of the chest-affection. I recollect one patient, a man who had suffered from tubercular phthisis for several years, who came under my care ; he had cavities in the apices of both lungs, and occasional smart htemoptysis. Besides ex- amining the chest myself, I had him carefully examined by the physicians of the hospital, who agreed with me in thinking that the advanced stage of the chest-disease, and his extreme debility, contraindicated operation, and I declined to accede to his request to amputate the limb. He left, and went to another hospital near his home, where he induced the surgeon to take off his limb ; and eight months afterwards, he presented himself to me, looking in pretty good condition, and, as he said, with less cough and spitting of blood; and he lived for two or three

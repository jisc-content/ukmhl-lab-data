FRACTURE OF SCAPULA-. 371 in confining the movements of the bone by a bandage, placing a pad in the axilla, and keeping the arm close to the side. In fracture of the acromion there is generally drooping and round- ing of the shoulder, with a want of power in raising the arm ; it is generally merely the point of the acromion that is broken off. The treatment consists in placing a pad in the axilla, and keeping the arm fixed to the sideâ€”the same apparatus as is used in most fractures about the shoulder-joint. There is a fracture of the scapula which occurs, though very rarely, and which is difficult to diagnose from dislocation at the shoulder. This is fracture of the neck of the scapula, or fracture through the glenoid cavity detaching almost all that part of the bone. This fracture was first described by Sir Astley Cooper. In it the shoulder presents a square appearance, and a cavity is seen below the acromial arch, just as in dislocation of the shoulder. The elbow projects from the side, and when we raise the arm and draw it out the dislocation disappears. The existence of this fracture is denied by some, and one of Sir A. Cooper's supposed cases was proved after death not to have been fracture of the scapula at all, but an oblique fracture through the head of the humerus. The fracture, however, really does occur, though it is very rare; for I had a case in hospital where the body was examined after death, and the scapula was found to be broken through the neck of the glenoid cavity (Plate xv., Tig. 1).* The treatment is the same as in fracture of the neck of the humerus or of the clavicle: place a pad in the axilla, and fix the scapula by a broad handkerchief or bandage, keeping the arm slung and the elbow bound to the side. The fracture unites readily enough, and leaves a useful arm. * See Clinical cases at end of Section.

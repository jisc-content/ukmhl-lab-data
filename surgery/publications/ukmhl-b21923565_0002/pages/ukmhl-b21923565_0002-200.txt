396 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. days. The same treatment is applicable to dislocations of tlie fingers. Feactures of the Metacarpal Bones are generally easily detected, though in some cases they are rather obscure, especially if only one bone has been broken, and more particularly if that be the metacarpal bone of the ring or middle finger. In such a case we have crepitus only when we press on the particular bone which is broken, because the other metacarpal bones act as lateral supports and keep it in position. Fracture of the meta- carpal bone of the little finger is very easily made out. The best way of putting up these fractures is to make the patient grasp a ball of soft worsted or tow in his hand, and then bandage up the hand in that position. The neighbouring bones act the part of splints. In certain cases we require to keep the hand straight, and then we apply a splint in front along with a bandage. In two or three weeks the fracture is completely united and no deformity results. Compound fractures of the fingers generally require ampu- tation on account of the accompanying laceration of the joints, tendons, and soft tissues. Fractures and other injuries of the bones of the cranium and face, and those of the spine and trunk, I shall reserve for con- sideration under the head of Eegional Surgery, as the compli- cations arising from the implication of important organs are in these injuries the features of greatest interest.

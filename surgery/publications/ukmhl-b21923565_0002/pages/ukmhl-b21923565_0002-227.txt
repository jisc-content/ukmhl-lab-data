EVULSION OF THE PATELLA. 417 bandage, whicli will keep tlie parts in position quite as well as any special apparatus. Evulsion of the Ligamentum Patell.^: is a rarer accident than fracture of the patella. Some say it may be mistaken for fracture, but in the rupture of the ligament of the patella the whole bone is drawn up in front of the thigh, and with it a portion of the ligament, while, in the fracture, the lower fragment is always distinct and movable. Immediately after the acci- dent happens a good deal of swelling occurs. There may be a slight projection of the upper part of the tibia, but it is not movable, and cannot be mistaken for the lower fragment of the patella. This injury seems to arise from violent action of the extensor muscles of the thigh. The patient, by a violent effort, tries to save himself from falling, and the knee at the time being bent very forcibly, the violent contraction of the quadri- ceps extensor causes the evulsion of the ligament of the patella. The treatment of this injury is exactly the same as that of fractiire of the patella, though it is a little more troublesome. Because in it we have no two fixed points to bring together, and therefore we must employ a little lateral pressure. The limb is placed on an inclined plane, and slung and bandaged as before, but here we require to take care to prevent the liga- mentum patellae from forming a new adhesion laterally. In fracture of the ]Datella there is not this risk. The parts must be kept in very accurate position, and the limb on the inclined plane, for at least seven or eight weeks, which is longer than is necessary in fracture of the patella. In fact the limb ought to be kept in the straight position by means of a splint or starched bandage for some time afterwards, so as to prevent any muscular action affecting the newly-united parts. 2 E

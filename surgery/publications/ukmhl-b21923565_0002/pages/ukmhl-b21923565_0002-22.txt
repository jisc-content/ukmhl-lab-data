The long splint applied in a case of fractured femi^r. The sheet fixing the limb to the splint is f)artially ixndone to show its mode of application, and the position of the lateral Gooche's splints. Fig. 2. Inclined plane used in cases of fractured patella. Figs. 3 and 4. Fracture box apparatus, composed of two narrow pieces of wood and small sheet. Fig. 3 shows the apparatus partly ap- plied ; Fig. 4, A lateral view of the leg when the apparatus is completed. Fig. 5. Comminuted fracture of tibia, put up on Liston's double inclined- plane splint. Fig. 6. Back-splint apj^lied, in a case of fracture near the ankle, to prevent retraction of foot (Dupuytren's method).—In this figure the back- splint alone is shown, but I generally use narrow pasteboard splints, with foot-pieces, in addition. See page 423. Fig. 7. Fracture of both bones of leg, treated with lateral pasteboard splints. Limb laid on outer side, with the knee flexed. Fig. 8. Stirrup-splint applied in a case of fracture near the ankle, to pre- vent retraction of the foot. Page 422. Figs. 9 and 10. External appearances, and skeleton view of parts concerned in Pott's fracture. (Eeduced by photograph from Pott's original work.) Fig. 11. Front view of Pott's fracture treated with Dupuytren's splint, showing the inclination given to the foot when the apparatus is adjusted.

SECONDARY HEMORRHAGE. 537 likely to withstand the action of the ligature till permanent haemostatic changes have occurredâ€”or the soft parts around the vessel being so injured that sloughing and recurrence of bleed- ing are likely to take place. I have already alluded to a case of ligature of the axillary for bleeding from the brachial in a burn of the arm. This example will be found in the Clinical Cases* appended to this section. In all cases, the bleeding point must be secured above and below by ligatures or needles. In some cases, from peculiar circumstances, amputation may become imperative. We must not, however, proceed to heroic measures too hurriedly. I have known slight bleed- ing occur in a case of ligature of the femoral some days after the ligature had separated, in which, by leaving the wound exposed without compression, the haemorrhage ceased, and never recurred (see Clinical Cases). In cases where arteries are opened into by diseased action of the neighbouring textures, it is often impossible to detect the bleeding point, even though we may suspect it. In these cases we must trust to pressure, or, if that cannot be borne, then we must tie the arterial trunk higher up. This may suffice ; but it may fail, as in the case of Mr. A. T., recorded in the Clinical Cases. * Page 594.

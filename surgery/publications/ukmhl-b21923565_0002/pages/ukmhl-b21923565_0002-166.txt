364 INJURIES OF JOINTS. Compound Dislocations are very dangerous accidents, more so indeed than even compound fractures, with which they have many features in common. In some favourable cases, in young persons, by immediate reduction, closing the wound accurately, and applying carbolic oil covered with gutta percha, or varnish- ing over the wound with collodion, or similar medium, so as to exclude all external sources of irritation, and by adopting the ice treatment recommended for wounds of joints, together with care- ful after-treatment, we may save a useful limb. In most cases, however, either primary resection of the joint, or amputation, if the surrounding textures be much injured, requires to be per- formed. In patients above middle age I believe amputation to be the safest plan ; but the surgeon must judge of the conditions in every individual case. I would refer you to what I have already said on the subject of wounds of joints, and lacerated, contused, and gunshot wounds, as bearing on this subject, and as enabling you to decide on operative or other measures in the treatment of compound luxations.

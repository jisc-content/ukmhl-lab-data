565 VARICOSE ANEURISM. circumscribed false aneurism, so that the analogy does not hold. The only two cases I can find, in which the Hunterian method was tried, proved fatal. One occurred in the practice of the late Sir Wm. Lawrence. In it gangrene supervened, amputation was resorted to, and the patient died. The other, a case of varicose aneurism in the popliteal region, resulting from gunshot wound, is recorded by Dr. Dorsey, of Philadelphia. In that case the femoral artery was tied, and fatal secondary haemorrhage took place. In a case which came under my own care lately, after full consideration of all the circumstances, I operated by placing ligatiires on the femoral, both above and below the aneurismal tumour, without opening the sac, so as at once to avoid interfer- ence with the vein, and to cut off the disturbing influence of the retrograde current of arterial blood, and so favour consolida- tion of the contents of the sac. The plan answered my fullest expectations, and I believe it to be the proper procedure in varicose aneurism of the femoral, and even in the brachial, although, as I said, in that region the risk of the ordinary opera- tion is less. The principle of the procedure is to tie the vessel above and below the aneurism, so as to prevent either direct or retrograde blood-current interfering with coagulation and obliter- ation, whilst we avoid interference with the vein, which we cannot do if we open the aneurism, as the vein communicates with it.

Eracture of the Neck of the Humerus.—This term is usually applied to fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. Frac- ture through the anatomical neck is comparatively rare, and generally occurs in the form of diastasis in young subjects before the epiphyses are fairly connected with the shaft of the bone. An inter-articular fracture does, however, occasionally occur in adults. In fracture of the surgical neck we have the humerus shortened, the elbow slightly tilted from the side, and a depres- sion formed a little above the insertion of the deltoid muscle. The shoulder is rounded, and there is often some degree of swell- ing, which adds to this appearance. If we pass the hand from the acromion .process downwards, we feel the head of the hume- rus in its place, and then lower down we feel the depression above the insertion of the deltoid. The head of the bone is kept A^ery nearly in position by the capsular muscles. The shaft of the bone is very much displaced, its axis being altered by the tilting outwards of the lower portion. The upper part of the broken shaft is drawn in towards the axilla and chest by the action of the muscles attached to the bicipital groove—namely, the pectoralis major, the latissimus dorsi, and the teres major. The deltoid stiU further assists this displacement by drawing the shaft upwards. The fracture is therefore attended with shorten- ing, great distortion, and loss of power in moving the arm.

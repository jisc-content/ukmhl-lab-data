LECTURE LXXI: Traumatic or False Aneurism : Diffuse and Circumscribed ; Nature, Progress and Treatment—Aneurismal Varix : its Definition and Diagnosis—Varicose Aneurism : Symptoms and distinguishing Features—Treatment of tlie two Conditions founded' on the Patliology of each. A Traumatic or False Aneurism is iiotHng more or less than that which results from a wounded artery. When a vein is implicated as well as the artery, the symptoms are to a certain extent modified. The most common form is the Diffuse false aneurism; the blood becomes diffused among the tissues, forming a sort of flattened mass over the course of the vessel, which communicates to it a feeling of pulsation. The blood continues to be poured out for some time, so that the effusion is generally considerable, causing the limb to be swollen and painful. A false aneurism may also be circumscribed. For example, if the wound in the artery be small, and if pretty firm compression be applied at the time, the blood does not escape in large quan- tity or with great force into the limb, but gradually forms a sort of tumour, the cellular tissue becoming condensed and thickened so as to form a rounded sac, which completely circumscribes the effused blood, like the sac of a true aneurism, and in some parts of the body the anatomical disposition of the surrounding struc- tures assists this limitation. A circumscribed false aneurism in some degree approaches in character to true aneurism, in so far as the limitation favours consolidation of its contents, when the force of the proximal blood-current is intercepted or diminished. The treatment which I consider the best in all cases of ordinary false aneurism, whether diffuse or circumscribed, with the exception of certain circumscribed false aneurisms of the

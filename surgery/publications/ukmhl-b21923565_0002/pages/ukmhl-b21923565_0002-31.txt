INJUKIES & DISEASES OF SPECIAL ORGANS. DISEASES OF BONES AND JOINTS. LECTURE XXXV. Diseases of Bone, their Natiire and Modifications—Explanatory Sketch of the Ana- tomical Structure of Bone, viewed in relation to its Pathology—Acute Ostitis and Periostitis—Local and Constitutional Symptoms and Complications. In bone, as in all other tissues, diseased action is modified by texture. The short and flat bones of the body—excepting those of the cranium—are composed chiefly of cancellated texture, enclosed in a thin fibrous shell. They therefore, as well as the articular extremities of long bones—on account of their loose structure— undergo morbid changes, somewhat analogous to those of the soft tissues. The cranial bones have a very dense table internally, a tolerably dense one externally, and an intermediate medullary and vascular striicture, the diploe. These therefore closely re- semble the long bones' as regards their anatomical structure and pathological changes. The shaft of a long bone is composed of a very hard fibrous structure externally, which encloses a tubrJar cavity termed the medullary canal. On the exterior of such a bone we observe a number of small grooves or lines. If we look Avith a low magnifying power at a section of it, these broken lines are seen to be the oblique openings through which vessels pass from the periosteal surface into the dense texture of the bone. This dense texture of the shaft is very complex. In it are seen the Haversian canals conveying blood-vessels; and also canaliculi, which serve to convey the blood-plasma to the lacunte. This structure is

516 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. in my own possession, and to several of my dissections of the arteries of stumps, which are contained in tlie Anatomical Museum of this University. By looking at the preparations referred to, any one may satisfy himself that, even when there is a large extent of artery without any collateral branches to interrupt the process, the actual extent of obliteration seldom exceeds an inch and a half or two inches ; showing that this is all the space which nature absolutely requires for the safe closure of an artery after ligature. Having thus compared the usually received statement with the actual facts of the case, I would now call attention to the practical bearing of these facts. It has been said, that as a portion of artery which gives off many collateral branches is unfavourable for ligature, so, on the other hand, a vessel which gives off no collateral branches for a long distance is placed in the most favourable circumstances for the operation ; as, owing to the great extent of obliteration, there will be little risk of secondary lisemorrhage from the impulse of the retrograde circulation. Now it is perfectly true, that if an artery be tied at a part where several branches arise in close juxtaposition with each other, there will be a great risk of secondary haemorrhage; because, owing to the force of the retrograde circulation through the anastomoses, oblitera- tion never passes heyond the nearest collateral branch. If we dismiss, as incorrect, Dr. Jones's statement that the obliteration always extends up to the next collateral branch, then it will be perceived that the truth of the second proposition above mentioned does not follow, because the absence of collateral vessels does not necessarily increase the extent of obliteration beyond certain limits, whilst in other respects it may prove in- jurious. I think it is not difficult to show, that in vessels near the heart the risk of secondary hfemorrhage be greater in an artery which gives off no collateral branches than in one which does, because, if these are not so near each other, or so near the place of ligature, as to interfere with the essential parts of the process of closure, they will be positively useful in breaking the direct force of the current of the circulation.

486 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. would not excite adhesive inflammation. He also pointed out distinctly their bad effects in destroying the vasa vasorum of the artery, by insulating it too much, and by the profuse suppuration induced by large foreign bodies in the neighbour- hood of the vessels. Strangely enough, his very dread of ex- tensive suppuration seems to have led him to inculcate as useful a meddlesome interference which would have been almost as mischievous as that which he condemns. Tor at page 161 we find the following passage :—" It is obvious that every possible means should be employed to prevent the extension of this ulcerative process; hence, we should guard against the ac- cumulation of pus about the extremity of the artery, by such pressure as the parts may conveniently bear; by placing the limb in such a position as will allow a ready exit to the pus ; and in some instances hij the application of a sponger Had he simply restricted himself to the second part of his plan—namely, attention to position—or at all events completely omitted the last, his advice would have been more in accordance with his own general views. The views of Dr. Jones regarding the small round ligature were soon very generally adopted and acted on in this country. But, curiously enough, about the same time, and apparently without having seen Dr. Jones' writings, the celebrated Scarpa published his memoir on aneurism, advocating very opposite practice in the ligature of arteries—reviving, in point of fact, the almost exploded views which had previou.sly given rise to the use of the p)resse-artere, and the other measures adopted by the older surgeons to prevent division of the arterial tunics by the too firm constriction of the round ligature. In speaking of the ligature as applied in cases of aneurism, he says, " By the ligature of the great arteries as a radical method of cure of aneurism, / do not mean a noose, ivith ivhich the artery is con- strieted cireularly, hut I wish to he understood to speak of a pressure made hy a ligature of convenient breadth upon the artery, hy means of luliicli its two opposite sides are hrought into muhicd and firm contact, without the noose resting or pressing strongly

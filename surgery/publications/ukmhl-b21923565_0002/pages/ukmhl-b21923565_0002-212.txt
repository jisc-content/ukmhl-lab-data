Fracture of Neck of Femur—Intra and Extra Capsular—Diagnosis and Modes of Treatment—Fractures of Shaft of Femur at different parts—Directions and causes of Displacement—Treatment. Fracture of the neck of the femur, or separation of the head of the bone from the trochanters, occurs in a variety of ways, and may be caused by comparatively slight force. The fracture may be completely within the capsule of the joint, and it is then called intra-capsular. Or it may occur external, to the reflection of the synovial sac, and also in a great measure beyond the principal attachment of the capsular ligament, in which case it is called extra-capsular fracture. Or it may partake of both characters, being partly intra and partly extra capsular. The subjects of it are generally persons well advanced in life. The general symptoms of this fracture, whether intra or extra capsular, are very similar after a time, so much so that there is some difficulty in making out distinctly whether it is intra or extra capsular. If the case be seen immediately after the accident has been sustained, there are diagnostic symptoms which hel^) us to distinguish the two injuries. We have shortening of the limb, eversion of the foot and knee, swelling about the trochanter, and great projection in that region.* These symptoms occur in all cases of fracture of the neck of the femur, whether intra or extra capsular, after some time has elapsed, say from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. But in a purely intra-capsular fracture the symptoms are at first much less marked. There is eversion of the foot and knee, but there is very little shortening of the limb, not more than half-an-inch or so, and there is not much swelling at the hip. Sometimes it is very difficult to elicit crepitus. This is due partly to the depth at which the bone

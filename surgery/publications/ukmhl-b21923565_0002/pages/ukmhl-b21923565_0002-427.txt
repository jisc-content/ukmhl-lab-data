CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 603 isolated by the suppuration around it. At the same time, to form a correct view of the treatment adopted, it is necessary to keep in mind all the circumstances of the case; for the previous debilitated state of the patient, from the long-continued irrita- tive fever, the subsequent profuse discharge, hectic, and general exhaiistion, together with the disorganised and altered condition of the structures of the affected part of the limb, were all com- plications requiring to be carefully considered in deciding on the measures to be adopted when the secondary haemorrhage occurred. I have said that I suspected that the bleeding might come from the fibular artery, from the relative position of that vessel to the diseased bone and the unhealthy suppuration around. Hence my first object was to try and secure the vessel directly at the bleeding point. But, on examining the exposed surface, which the extensive incision in the leg readily admitted of, there was no jet of blood or other indication to guide me, while the altered condition of the structures in the wound, the matting together of some parts, and the sloughy condition of others, caused me to desist, as I felt that, under such circum- stances, without some direct indication of bleeding, a tedious dissection would be required to reach the vessel, with no certainty of reaching it at the open point; and, after all, my surmise as to its being the fibular artery might be wrong. Again, if an opening in the vessel were found, its coats might be so xmhealthy as not to hold a ligature above and below the opening. The subsequent dissection of the limb proved the difficulties of direct ligature to be even greater than I had antici- pated. The portion of the vessel where the opening existed was surrounded by an encysted abscess, and had only bled indirectly into the wound ; hence the reason that no jet could be observed on removing the pressure on the femoral when examining the wound. The arterial tunics, where they were isolated, were so soft and sloughy that they would not have held a ligature for a few hours, if at all ; whilst immediately beyond the isolation the whole track of the vessel was so

Fractures of the Clavicle—Symptoms and Causes of Displacement—Treatment— Dislocations of Clavicle—At Sternal Extremity—Secondary Dislocation from Disease of Spine, and Operative Measures required for its relief—At Acromial end—Appearances somewhat resembling Dislocation at Shoulder Joint—Pro- gnosis and Treatment—Fractures of Scapula—Fracture of Neck, simulating Dislocation into Axilla—Treatment. The Clavicle may be broken at different parts, according to the direction of tbe force which causes the injury, but the point of all others where it usually gives way is just a little to one side or other of the middle of the bone. When fracture occurs at this part, the displacement is very marked. The outer end of the sternal portion of the bone projects, and appears to be drawn upwards. The shoulder falls down, and is drawn forwards and inwards towards the chest, so that the axillary space is diminished in size. The patient generally keeps the arm semi-flexed, and supported by the opposite hand. The slightest movement of the shoulder causes intense pain. The patient can usually make out the diagnosis of the injury himself The symptoms, then, are— projection of the outer end of the sternal portion of the bone, depression of the acromial end, falling-down of the arm, and pain on movement of the parts. The causes of these symptoms are first and principally the weight of the arm bearing on the scapula and the acromial end of the clavicle, and so dragging down the outer fragment. The internal, or riding end of the bone, is little, if at all, displaced ; it remains equipoised between the clavicular attachment of the sterno-mastoid above, and the clavicular fibres of the pectoralis major and the rhomboid ligament beneath, so that the muscular forces are nearly balanced. The muscles attached to the scapula and humerus—the pectoralis major and minor, the latissimus dorsi, teres major and subclavius—tend to drag the

In speaking of the diseases of veins, I pointed out the necessity for bearing in mind their anatomical and physiological condi- tions. The same remarks apply with even greater force to the arterial system, in reference to the injuries and diseases to which it is liable, and to operations or other methods of treatment. The points which I should wish briefly to recall to your minds on this subject are—Isf. The structure of the arterial tube, and its function and source of nutrition. 2d. The cellular sheath of arteries, and its connection with the vessel. Sd. The peculiarities of the arterial circulation in reference to anastomosis. For our present purpose, it will be sufficient to consider the artery as consisting of three tunics:—a. The internal serous or villous coat. b. The middle elastic fibrous or mixscular coat. c. The external fibro-cellular coat. The villous or serous coat presents a smooth free surface, and is covered with a slight moisture. Its smoothness favours the circulation of the blood through the artery. This lining membrane passes into the capillaries, and into every branch of the artery, and so long as it remains entire the circulation will in a great measure be uninterrupted. A very slight lesion, how- ever, at any point of the lining membrane, will lead to an inter- ruption of the circulation, and gradually to obliteration of the

557 ANEURISM. sider tliat if the arteria inuominata had been tied, a fatal result would soon have taken place. If it had been a case of ordinary- lateral aneurism, the cure would probably have been perfect, but the aneurism was a fusiform one, and therefore less amen- able to treatment. Under similar circumstances, I would again resort to this plan of treatment, which was just Brasdor's opera- tion of tying the vessel on the distal side of the aneurism, with the addition that we also removed the source of the attraction of the blood to the parts beyond the tumour, and so gave a greater chance of consolidation to the contents of the sac.

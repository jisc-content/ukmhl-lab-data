POPLITEAL ANEURISM. 587 aneurism; and therefore, when these symptoms are present, we ought carefully to examine the limb, so as to see whether or not an aneurism exist, and we must not be careless in trusting to the history, or too sure that the injury is only rupture of some muscular fibres. As regards malignant growths in this neighbour- hood, the appearance of the tumour and the history of the case should enable us to form a correct diagnosis. In a case of erectile tumour, or aneurism by anastomosis as it is called, the symptoms may be so identical with those of true aneurism as almost to prevent us from being quite certain as to the true nature of the case till we cut down upon the growth ; but this form of disease is very rare in the popliteal space, while in the position of the posterior tibial or peroneal arteries, where it is more common, the true aneurism is very seldom met with. As regards the Treatment of popliteal aneurism : If we see the patient in the early stage of the disease, while the tumoiir is not very large, and whilst the contents of the sac are perfectly fluid, unless the disease threatens to go on very rapidly, it is well to give the patient some rest before operating. We should employ means to hasten the formation of the coagulum within the sac, and so favour the application of the ligature afterwards. The reason why I advise this practice is, that in the fluid state of the aneurism there is no obstruction to the collateral circulation into the sac, and if we tie the artery in this stage, the blood would likely get into the aneurism again by these collateral branches, and by its disturbing force prevent coagulation of the contents of the sac. While there is no coagulum within the sac, the col- lateral branches easily re-establish the circulation in it, and between it and the ligature. A period of rest, therefore, shordd be enjoined in this early stage, before operating, whilst we em- ploy flexion of the limb, and also compression over the artery where it lies in Hunter's canal, so as to prevent any risk of rup- ture of the aneurismal sac during the flexion. The method of carrying out the treatment by flexion in cases of popliteal aneu- rism is as follows :â€”A close-fitting stocking or slipper is placed ou the foot, and to it is fixed a piece of tape or strap ; round the

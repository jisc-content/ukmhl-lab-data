292 DISEASES OF JOINTS. tain rest of the parts and promote absorption. At this stage the use of iodide of potassium internally is of great service in prevent- ing those chronic changes of texture which are apt to arise from exuded lymph. After a time, passive motion at first, and then gradual active motion of the limb, should be encouraged, and the vs^arm douche used to tlie joint and neighbouring parts, followed by friction with the hand. In those cases of articular inflammation known as gonorrhceal rheumatism, active depletion is rarely indicated, but in other respects the general indications are similar to those already stated. If the patient has been using balsam of copaiba or cubebs in any form, these remedies must be abandoned and other means used to allay the urethral irritation. In such cases we generally try, by means of warm bathing and other measures, to restore the urethral discharge temporarily. When acute or subacute inflammation attacks the joint of a strumous person, our prognosis, as I have already indicated, is less favourable, as chronic changes of a scrofulous character are apt to supervene on the irritation so excited. In such cases the use of dex^letion by cupping or leeching must be very cautiously employed, if employed at all, for we must keep in mind that there is in such constitutions little reparative power, and hence we should avoid the withdrawing of blood from the system. In some few cases, however, where the pain is intense and the inflammatory action violent, the local abstraction of a small quantity of blood may serve to check the disease at less expense of vital power than would be sustained if the symptoms were allowed to progress. As a general rule, however, we restrict our treatment to perfect rest, anodyne applications, and the con- stitutional remedies already indicated.

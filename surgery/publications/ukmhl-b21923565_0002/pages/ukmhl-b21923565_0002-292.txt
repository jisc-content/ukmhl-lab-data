LECTUEE LXIIL Artificial Hemostatics—Importance of the Subject—Historical Sketcli and Review of the Principal Opinions which have been held regarding the Ligature of Arteries. In my last lecture I spoke of wounded and torn arteries, and ex- plained the processes by which nature arrests bleeding in such cases, constituting what is termed natural hjemostatics. I also alluded briefly to certain means used by the surgeon to assist nature and promote the arrestment of hjEmorrhage. The subject of Artificial Hemostatics is one of the most important in surgery, and requires to be very fully brought be- fore you. The use and effects of the ligature as the means most commonly adopted hitherto for arresting haemorrhage, and still most generally practised, come first to be considered, and it will be well that I commence by giving you a historical sketch of the princix^al opinions which have been held regarding the essentials to the obliteration of an artery by ligature. I believe that a knowledge of the previous history of such investigations is absolutely necessary for their further successful prosecution, and this is too much neglected in the present day. In many depart- ments of surgery there is a constant tendency of circumstances to revive, with slight modifications, doctrines and practice formerly inculcated, but which had been abandoned as imperfect or bad. Now, a knowledge of the history of the subject, by showing what were the comparative advantages and imperfections of such exploded doctrines and practice, and how far the objections which had formerly led to their disuse were well founded or the reverse, or how far these could be met by certain modifications, would do much to prevent the revival of what had on good grounds been abandoned as dangerous or useless. Such know- ledge may, on the other hand, serve to point out the causes of

ANEURISRI. 545 paratively equal dilatation of the vessel, the blood sweeping off any coagulum from tlie walls of the sac; but as the lining mem- brane becomes irregular from the deposition of atheromatous matter, and assumes the granular appearance formerly alluded to, the blood-particles tend to become arrested, partly on this account, and partly owing to the diminisliing force of the blood- current brought about by the establishment of the collateral circulation. In the saccular or lateral true aneurism, the different steps of the process are very well illustrated, and the tendency towards a successful issue is much more considerable than in the fusiform variety. Here, from the greater irregularity of the internal sur- face of the sac, particles of fibrine readily attach themselves, so as to form a clot; the determination of the blood to the colla- teral branches is also well marked ; and, as the sac increases in size, its cavity is more and more removed from the influence of the current in the artery, so that a degree of stagnation ensues, which is extremely favourable to the occurrence of coagulation. This, in the first instance, takes place at the parts of the sac most distant from the circulation, and it goes on until a large mass of clot has accumulated. After a time the colouring matter of the clot becomes absorbed, and at last we find the sac of the aneurism filled with a mass of decolorised coagulum arranged in strata, and partly connected with the lining mem- brane by means of an exudation of plastic lymph. The natural cure is thus all but completed, and it would be completed in many cases were it not that the continual agitation of the blood, at the mouth of the sac prevents entire coagulation, and by-and- by tends to undo the work which has been accomplished. It breaks down the clots already formed, and once more exposes the sac to dilatation and enlargement, which may steadily pro- ceed until rupture takes placeâ€”a result the more likely to occur if the force of the blood in the sac be not greatly abated by the establishment of the collateral circulation. In the fusiform aneurism, as has been already remarked, these changes take place less perfectly, and it may be added 2 N

LECTURE LXVIL Changes in the Collateral Vessels and their Anastomoses after Ligature—The Apparent Formation of new Vessels in such Cases—Effects produced in neigh- bouring Stractures by these Changes—Their accompanying Symptoms—Sum- mary of the Effects of the Ligature. One of the first effects of the ligature of an artery, and one "vvhich has been admitted by all investigators to be of constant occurrence, is the distension and enlargement of the collateral vessels and of all their anastomoses. This effect is easily explicable by mere physical lav/s, for it is obviously the result of the general law which regulates fluids—that they pass in the direction where there is least resistance. Hence, it is obvious that the current of blood propelled through the canal of an artery, when it meets with the complete obstruction caused by the constriction of the ligature, is of necessity forced upon the collateral vessels through their anastomoses with the artery tied, on the cardiac or proximal side of the ligature. As the pressure of the blood in these collateral vessels is equal in all their ramifications, the consequence is, that their branches which communicate with the artery on the distal side of the ligature also become distended and empty themselves into the canal of the artery beyond tlie deligated point, thus indirectly re-establishing the circulation in it. But whilst the physical cause of this effect is evident and admitted by all, there are many points connected with it, and the uses which nature makes of this change for effecting the process of obliteration, and for carrying on the obstructed circulation by new channels, which are of great interest. I believe that its effects upon organs in the vicinity of the artery tied, will, if carefully examined, also serve to explain some phenomena occurring after the ligature of particular arteries which have been referred to other causes.

2 G LECTURE LIX. Club-Foot—Classification of the different Forms—Former Methods of Treatment —Subcutaneous Tenotomy—Necessity for After-Treatment by Apparatus— Talipes Equinus—Talipes Calcaneus—Talipes Varus and Talipes Valgus— Causes of Deformity and Treatment of each. The various forms of Club-Foot constitute the largest and most successful field for the practice of orthopedic surgery. In a course of lectures such as this I cannot enter into all the plans of treatment adopted ; but will state as succinctly as possible the nature of the deformity, the general principles to be attended to in regard to treatment, and describe the methods of operating I have found most simple and efficient in my own practice. Club-foot is usually classified under four primary forms:—1. Talipes Equinus ; 2. Talipes Calcaneus ; 3. Talipes Varus ; and 4. Talipes Valgus. Other varieties depending on the combina- tion of the features of the primary forms, such as Talipes Equino- Varus, are mentioned, but in most cases of talipes varus the heel is drawn upwards ns well as inwards. The different varieties of club-foot used to be treated princi- pally by various forms of mechanical apparatus, such as boots of different shapes. In some cases tenotomy was performed by cutting through the skin as well as the tendons. Subcutaneous tenotomy was introduced comparatively recently. This is a most important operation, for we can by it remove many kinds of deformity; we should not, however, trust entirely to the division of the tendons, which is merely a means to an end. There is, generally, some altered condition of the articulations and bones, as well as of the tendons, which requires to be remedied ; and properly applied mechanical apparatus is therefore necessary, if we wish for a complete cure. In a case of talipes varus, for example, when we divide the tendons in fault, we can bring the

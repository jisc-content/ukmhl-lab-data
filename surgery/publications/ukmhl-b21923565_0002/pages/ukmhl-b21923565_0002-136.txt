LECTURE XLVI. Injuries of Bones and Joints—Definitions of the terms Fracture, Dislocation, Dia- stasis—Diagnostics of Fracture and Dislocation in general—Classification of Fractures—Simple Fracture—Process of Union—Eeduction and Coaptation— Various causes of Displacement—Retentive Apparatus. Having discussed the diseases of bones and joints, I now proceed to the consideration of the injuries to which tliey are liable. In treating of fractures and dislocations, whether generally or spe- cially, I make it a rule to treat of them together instead of separately. This at first sight might seem to imply a want of arrangement, but in reality it is the best method, as it enables the teacher to bring more fully before the student the points of similarity and dissimilarity between fractures and dislocations, and by force of contrast to impress them with the importance of the conditions of greatest value in reference to diagnosis and treatment. A fracture may be defined as a solution of continuity in any bone ; a dislocation is an abnormal separation of the articu- lar surfaces of two bones from each other; diastasis is a term used to denote a solution of continuity between the epiphysis and shaft or body of a bone, an accident which occurs in young persons. In all these conditions there is, of course, a displace- ment, but the term dislocation is in surgery restricted to the displacement of the articular end of a bone from its correspond- ing cavity or surface. There are certain general symptoms present in aU fractures. First, distortion and shortening of the limb, with some swelling and pain; unnatural mobility at the site of the fracture when the surgeon tries to move the limb; also crepitus, or a peculiar crackling sensation, caused by the opposed surfaces of the broken bone grating upon each other, which is considered as the pecu-

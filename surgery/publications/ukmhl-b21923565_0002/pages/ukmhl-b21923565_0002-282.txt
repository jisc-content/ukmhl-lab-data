470 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. hsemorrliage. Often at one point of the affected vein, a small, red, irritable spot appears on the skin, or in an ulcer over the vein, without much suppuration taking place. - Without much warning this gives way, and when the patient is going ahout, profuse haemorrhage, of a very dangerous character, may take place suddenly. If the patient continu.e in the erect or semi-erect position, it may even prove fatal, because it is not merely the blood from below that is escaping, as in vene- section, but the whole superimposed column of blood above the opening flows out, so that the right side of the heart is rapidly emptied, and fatal syncope ensues. The flow is rapid, both from the proximal and from the distal side of the opening. The treatment of such a case is very simple. Place the point of your finger on the bleeding orifice, lay the patient in the re- cumbent position, raise the limb a little, and apply a bandage from below upwards, over a compress placed on the bleeding point, and you at once arrest the haemorrhage. Sometimes abscesses form in or around a varicose vein. These must be opened freely, like any other abscess. In the fibrinous phlebitis, the vein is blocked up both above and below the abscess, so that there is no danger of hfemorrhage when the abscess in the vein is opened. In the radical cure for varix by the needles, it has been said that there is no risk of phlebitis supervening, but this is not strictly correct, for I have seen such cases. "Whilst this opera- tion is much freer from danger than any of the other methods of radical treatment, it is not absolutely without danger, for phlebitis does occasionally follow the operation.

Formerly, when tlie circulation, was not understood, and when the pathology and tendencies of the disease were less known, the treatment was without any fixed principle. One of the earliest methods consisted in applying direct pressure upon the tumour, with the view of preventing its growth, and finally obliterating it if possible. When this failed to effect a cure, the surgeon laid open the sac, turned out its contents, and tied the vessel above and below, just as is done now-a-days in cases of false aneurism. This, however, was found not to be a very successful mode of pro- cedure, for the diseased and friable condition of the artery at the seat of the ligature often rendered its application difficult, and, in the subsequent process of its separation, secondary htemor- rhage was very apt to ensue. Surgeons, therefore, wisely de- voted tlieir attention to the methods by which nature effected her cure. In the medical treatment of aneurism, Valsalva first recognised this natural tendency, and in a certain degree fol- lowed out its indications. To diminish the force and frequency of the circulation, he had recourse to frequent depletion, and also the use of antimony and other depressants. The patient was kept perfectly quiet, and his supply of nourishment was gradually reduced to the minimum necessary to support life. These extreme depressing measures, however, were soon given up as ineffectual,—indeed, when carried beyond a certain point, the principle was erroneous. To obtain in the natural process of cure a firm coagulum, a certain amoitnt of blood should be

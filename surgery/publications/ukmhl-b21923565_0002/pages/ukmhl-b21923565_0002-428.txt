604 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. incorporated with adherent lymph as even to defy its separation to any extent, by careful dissection, when removed from the limb. What probability, then, would there have been of treat- ing the vessel by direct ligature ? As to the method of indirectly controlling the bleeding, by weakening the general circulation through the limb, by ligature of the superficial femoral, no one can be more impressed than myself with its uncertainty, as compared with direct ligature, owing to the free anastomoses in the thigh and around the knee, above the bleeding point. But when, for the reasons above stated, the latter could not be adopted, I considered it right to give the patient that chance, rather than amputate, as I had seen it succeed in cases of a similar character. I had likewise, by somewhat similar means, successfully arrested hsemorrhage from ulceration of the brachial from sloughing, after a severe burn, by tying the third portion of the axillary artery. It is true that in that instance I at the same time applied ligatures above and below the wound of the brachial; but these ligatures separated by iilceration on the fifth day, so that, except for the ligature of the axillary artery controlling the circulation, bleeding would have recurred. Hence I felt warranted in trying it in this case; and, indeed, there was little room for hesitation, for the patient was so sunk from the recent bleeding, as to put immediate amputation out of the question ; and, as oozing was still going on and direct pressure had failed, something required to be done. There can be no doubt, I think, as to the generally admitted propriety of giving preference to direct ligature above and below the opening in all cases of wounded arteries, as a great general rule, and it is one which can scarcely be too much insisted on; but at the same time we must keep in mind that there are exceptions to this, as to all other general rules, and that much must depend upon the state of the vessel opened. If its coats are diseased and sloughy, if their vitality and that of the surrounding parts be impaired, as after extensive unhealthy suppuration or severe burns, then direct ligature, if trusted to

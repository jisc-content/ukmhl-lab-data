CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 433 good ; but he was rather pale, and suffered occasionally from dyspepsia, apparently depending on an inveterate habit of smoking ; whilst the small amount of local or general excite- ment caused by any of the operations performed on the arm, would argue a want of energy in the vital powers unfavourable to repair. Still, there was nothing so marked in the state of his general health as sufficiently to account for failure of union, and I think it is to the nature of the local injury in this case that we must look for the explanation. It will be observed that the humerus was broken across at two points, and that the fracture was the result of direct violence of a kind likely to inflict great injury on the surrounding soft parts. The upper fracture united readily and completely, but the very consolidation at that part would diminish the free cir- culation through the medullary Haversian structure, and, con- sequently, impair the vitality of the portion of the shaft between the two fractured points, whilst the bruising of the soft textures would be likely to impede the periosteal supply of nutrition, and thus the lower fracture would be placed in most unfavourable circumstances for union. Secondly, as regards the treatment, the simpler measures at first adopted proved quite inefficacious, apparently producing scarcely any local excitement whatever. In deciding on resec- tion of the ends of the fractured bone, I determined to remove no more than the rounded and atrophied ends, and to do so with as little disturbance of the parts immediately surrounding the bone as possible. Having often observed, in cases which had come under my notice, in which resection had failed, that fully two inches, or even more, had been removed, it always seemed to me, that not only the amount of bone thus removed, but also the great denudation required to effect its removal, was sufficient to account for the failure, besides increasing the risk of severe constitutional disturbance. Hence I adopted the plan described, by which I was enabled, by using the bone-pliers, to complete the section without insulating the humerus, except the mere portion to be removed; whilst the bone so divided would more 2 F

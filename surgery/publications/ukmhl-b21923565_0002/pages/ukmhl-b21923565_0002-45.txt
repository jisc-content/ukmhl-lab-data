CHRONIC PERIOSTEAL ABSCESS. 251 toms are very severe, we may trepan, though the diagnosis be doubtful, for even if there be no matter little harm is done, and much good may result from the relief of tension. In the true chronic periosteal abscess we should not open the abscess unless the case has advanced very far before we see it. Whilst there is still a good deal of thickness covering the parts, and when there is merely a pinkish blush on the surface, a blister should be applied over the abscess, and afterwards the part dressed with warm water lint. Under this treatment the swelling gradually becomes less and the matter is absorbed. I do not believe in any great absorption of purulent matter, but certainly in this form of abscess it does occur, for I have seen many cases of periosteal abscess disappear under the action of a blister, and the use of iodide of potassium. In these cases there is an alteration in the constitution of the secretions, such as the urine, showing that some organic matters are being eliminated. Such an abscess should certainly never be opened until we cannot possibly help it. If the abscess bursts, the opening should be enlarged to allow the free escape of the matter. If we do open the abscess, we find tliat the edges of the wound become everted, the gelatinous mass which forms the principal part of the collec- tion becomes sloughy, the surface of the bone becomes exposed and is rough, brown, and granular, not unlike what it is in caries or ulceration of bone. If the abscess opens itself, or if it has been opened, the opening should be enlarged so that the bone may be seen. A piece of lint covered with the powdered red oxide of mercury should then be applied on its surface. This acts as a stimulant without being a caustic, it destroys the vitality of the weak surface of the bone, which is thrown off as a granular discharge, and leaves a healthy surface below.

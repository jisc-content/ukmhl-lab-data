LECTURE LXV. Review and Appreciation of the different Opinions discussedâ€”Eesnlts of the Author's original Investigations. A REVIEW of tlie history of the ligature, which has formed the subject of the two preceding lectures, will be found instructive, as showing the gradual progress of any great doctrine towards perfection, although all the principal facts in the process may have been long known. When we look at the principles laid down by Dr. Joues as the results of his investigations, and for which he has received so much credit, it will be found that the great service he performed consisted not so much in pointing out any new fact observed in the process' of obliteration of an artery, as in scientifically investigating the siibject as a whole, ascertaining in a great measure the re- lative value of the different parts of the process, and drawing from his experiments sound practical deductions as to the causes of secondary haemorrhage, and as to the best means of procuring obliteration. Each part of the process on which he insists had formerly been noticed, as we have seen, by one or other of his predecessors. Thus, the division of the internal and middle coats of the vessel had been fully pointed out by Desault, Bichat, and by the late Professor John Thomson; but the two former had regarded it rather as an imperfection than as tending to pro]note adhesion in its simplest form, whilst to Professor Thomson we believe Dr. Jones was indebted for being directed towards this inquiiy. The coagulum within the artery, its shape and supposed value, had formed the subject of the extended investigations of M. Petit. From overrating its value, as the one essential, he had overlooked the other and more important parts of the process, and so was led to erroneous

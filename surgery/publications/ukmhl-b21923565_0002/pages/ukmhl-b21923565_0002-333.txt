EXTENT OF OB LIT ERA TION. hVl and in obviating its impulse upon the deligated part of the artery. Perhaps my meaning will be better understood by referring to particular arteries. Let us, for example, compare the case of ligature of the common carotid artery with that of the external third of the subclavian. Here we have two vessels, both in the vicinity of the centre of the circulation, but I believe, cccteris paribus, that there will be less risk of secondary haemorrhage in the case of the subclavian than in that of the carotid, because, in the former, there is sufficient space free from collateral branches to admit of the process of firm closure of the artery, in other words, there is as much space as nature generally uses for obliteration ; whilst the direct aortic impulse on the deligated point and the newly formed structures is diminished just in proportion to the number and size of the branches given off from the subclavian on the cardiac side of the ligature. The current of blood passes into these branches, where it meets with no resistance, instead of beating against the recent adhesions in the newly-obstructed part of the artery. The common carotid, on the other hand, presents an example of a long arterial tube giving off no coUatei'al branches. In it therefore, when tied, the deligated point is exposed on its proximal aspect to the full and direct force of the cardiac im- pulse ; whilst, on its distal side, it receives the collected force of the blood poured into it from the retrograde circulation through the various branches of the external and internal carotids and their anastomoses. For these reasons, and from observation of the fact stated with reference to extent of obliteration, I have come to the conclusionâ€”That, whilst a very short space between the col- lateral branches is unfavourable for ligature, a very long extent of artery without branches is not necessarily so favourable, in vessels near the heart, as a moderate space, say from an inch and a half to two inches according to the size and position of the artery, with collateral branches on either side of the ligature; as the presence of these branches is useful in diverting the impulse of the circulation from the deligated point.

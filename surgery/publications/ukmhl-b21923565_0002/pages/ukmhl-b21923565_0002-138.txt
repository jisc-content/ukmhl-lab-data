340 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. or droops, but in almost all other fractures shortening of the limb occurs. There are also special symptoms in particular fractures. If the ends of the fractured bone be overriding each other, there will be no crepitus. In fractures of the neck of the femur there is often no crepitus, when the parts are widely separate, and it is only by bringing the ends of the bone into contact that we can elicit it. In dislocation of the humerus it is not uncommon to feel a slight crepitus on moving the limb, owing to the osseous attachments of muscles being partially torn off by the force causing the dislocation, but, as a rule, there is no distinct crepitus in dislocation. Such are the general appearances of, and differences between, fractures and dislocations. Fractures are divided into several kinds :â€” Simple, where the bone is merely broken across trans- versely or obliquely at one point. Comminuted, where the bone is broken into fragments. Compound, where there is a wound caused either by the bone bursting through the soft parts and appearing externally, or caused by the force which produced the fracture wounding the soft parts down to the broken bone. It is, in fact, a wound of the soft parts com- municating with the fractured point. The mere exist- ence of a wound in the immediate neighbourhood of a fracture does not necessarily make it a compound fracture, unless the wound commu.nicates more or less directly with the point fractured. Compound comminuted, where there is a wound communi- cating with the fractured bone, the bone itself being shattered into fragments. In simple and in comminuted fractures there is no solution in the continuity of the integument, and no external wound. In the compound and in compound comminuted fractures there is an external wound communicating directly with the fractured bone. In SIMPLE FKACTUEES, as a rule, the injury is caused by the

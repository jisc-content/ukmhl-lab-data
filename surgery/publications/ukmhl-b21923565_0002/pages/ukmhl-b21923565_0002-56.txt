262 DISEASES OF BONES. uot felt. After the cautery has been applied, lint soaked in cold water, or a Kttle weak aqua ammoniee is used to allay the pain ; then poultices are applied until the slough separates; subsequently, some slightly stimulating dressing—such as resinous ointment— is used to keep the sore open for some time. As I have already intimated, great care must be paid to the constitutional treat- ment, by attention to the state of the digestive organs, and by tonic and nutrient regimen and diet to invigorate the general health. After some time, varying from two to three months, if the pain and uneasiness have disappeared, we permit the patient to move about cautiously; but before doing so, a Kght spinal support, very carefully fitted, should be used, so as to prevent the weight of the part of the body above the disease pressing injuriously on the affected vertebrae. I am very averse to so-called " sup- ports " in weak limbs or lateral curvatures as a general rule, but in this disease a well-made light support, resting on the pelvis and supporting the body by rests under the armpits, is essential to the treatment and admits of the patient using the lower limbs without risk. In cases where suppuration has occurred before we see the patient, the cautery can hardly do much good. The abscess should be opened by the exhausting syringe, or with the trocar and canula with the tube under water, as described in the lec- ture on suppuration (page 30). If the suppuration diminishes, then the cautery may be of use ; but, as I have already said, the chances of successful treatment at this stage are very small. All we can do is to maintain rest in the prone position, and try to keep up the patient's strength, in hopes of arresting the diseased action. I have taken this dangerous form of deep-seated caries as an example of the method or principles of treatment to be pursued in all cases in which the carious bone is beyond the reach of direct surgical interference.

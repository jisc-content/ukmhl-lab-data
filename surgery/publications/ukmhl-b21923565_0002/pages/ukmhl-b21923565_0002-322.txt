503 IIMJURIES AND DISEASES QF BLOODVESSELS. But besides this, I think the external effusion of plastic lymph, when its uses in the process are fully examined, will be found to be of itself sufficient to oppose a barrier to the occurrence of secondary ha3morrhage. The effusion of plastic lymph on the exterior of the artery is a part of the haemostatic process which my own experiments have shown me to be of great value, as tending to prevent secondary haemorrhage, and as supporting and favouring the changes in the interior of the vessel. This has hitherto been very little attended to, and its true value overlooked; I therefore wisli to enter more fully into a consideration of its gradual forma- tion, and what appears to me to be its use in the process of obliteration of an artery. Even so early as forty-eight hours after the ligature has been applied, we find that the lymph effused from the vessels of the sheath and neighbouring parts has enveloped the exterior of the artery, and begun to consolidate around and contract adhesions to the arterial parietes : that the mass of lymph extends for some distance above and below the ligature pressing upon the vessel ; and on a section of the vessel being made, the lymph is found j)rojecting into and filling up the groove formed by the ligature. At ninety-six hours, the plastic matter has become still further organised. It is firmer in structure and inseparable from the cellular coat of the artery, with which it is evidently incorporated, and a section of it shows it sending distinct bands of plastic matter from the part of the vessel below, to that above the point tied, as well as filling up the groove formed by the thread. If the vessel be examined when the ligature is separating, the lymph around it is found still further contracted and con- solidated, and the portion projecting into the groove formed by the thread is found to have completely filled up the space from which the ligature has passed, forming the medium of union between the divided ends of the vessel. The knot of the ligature is found enveloped in a sort of cup-like cavity or cyst, and the ends of the ligature are enclosed in a tubular sheath of firm lymph, whilst the section of the vessel shows that the portion

386 INJURIES OF BONES AND JOINTS. head of the radius backwards or forwards the head of the bone has a great tendency to slip out again after it has been reduced. It is articulated in such a way, that before dislocation can take place the annular ligament must be torn, and the lateral liga- ments also partially or entirely separated. These ligaments take a long time to unite ; and if the patient begins to move the arm too soon, the head of the bone is almost sure to slip out. Hence, after this dislocation, the arm must be bandaged as it is in cases of fractures of the condyles, and kept quiet for a longer period than is generally necessary in other dislocations.

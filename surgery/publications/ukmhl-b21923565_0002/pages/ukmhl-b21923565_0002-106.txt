DISEASES OF JOINTS. 310 often the best method of treatment; for an anchylosed joint in the upper extremity leaves a comparatively useless arm—cer- tainly a much less useful one than remains after the joint has been excised. In the arm we can get rid of all the diseased parts without much shock to the patient's general health. In the knee-joint also it is well not to wait too long before operating, for when abscesses begin to form round the joint, the case is less favourable; and so, when there is much disorganisation of the articular textures, we operate before the patient's health has suffered much. I believe that most cases of gelatinous de- generation in the knee are not well suited for excision. The operation does not seem to me to answer so well here as in some diseases of the articular ends of the bones; in most cases the general health of the patient is not so well suited for the operation, which requires considerable strength and involves a long period of convalescence. Moreover, I have found that even cases where excision of the elbow or wiist joints has been performed for gelatinous disease never go on so favourably as cases where the operation has been performed for what looks like more extensive disease. This form of diseased action seems to be of a low type, and connected with a very marked strumous diathesis, and the curative process seems to be very slow; hence, besides the risks of pytemia incidental to all operations in debilitated constitutions, it is often complicated with pre- existing disease of other organs, or a predisposition to diseased conditions, which are very liable to develop themselves during the progress of the disease, or after operations, such as excision or amputation performed for its removal. The complications most frequently met with are—disease of the lungs, kidneys, and occasionally, though much more rarely, disease of the membranes of the brain, or tubercle in the brain-substance. In drawing attention to such complications, I do not mention them as contraindicating operative procedure, but because I 'believe that by careful attention to the state of such patients, we may often be enabled to check the development of some of the con- ditions mentioned, when they arise during the after-treatment

* LECTUEE LV. Fracture of Condyloid Extremity of Femur—Displacing Causes—Treatment— Description of the method of using the Long Splint and Double-Inclined Plane in the different Fractures of the Femur—Fractures of the Patella— Displacing Causes—Method of Treatment—Evulsion of the Ligamentum Patellae—Its Diagnostic Appearances—Nature and Treatment. In fracture of the lower end of the femur, near its condyloid ex- tremity, the displacement is very characteristic. The lower fragment is invariably drawn backwards behind the upper, which remains very nearly in its natural position. In some cases from the action of the tendon of the adductor-magnus, the upper end of the lower fragment is thrown a little outwards. When the fracture is close to the condyloid portion of the femur, the lower part is bent directly back towards the leg. The cause of this displacement is the action of the gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles, which are attached to the lower part of the femur, dragging it back towards the leg. These muscles are not counteracted by any of the extensors in front, as the latter all pass over the joint. When the fracture is very low down, the small lower fragment is bent back on the leg to such an extent that it is very difficult to bring it in line with the upper part of the femur. In treating this fracture, the great point is first to bring the parts as nearly as possible into apposition. In order to do this, we generally require to put the patient under chloroform, so as to overcome all muscular resistance and enable us to model the broken parts accurately together. We then stretch the leg downwards and press the lower fragment upwards, so as to bring it into contact with the shaft of the bone. A padded splint is tlien placed behind, but the pad must not press directly into the popliteal space, lest it interfere with the circulation.

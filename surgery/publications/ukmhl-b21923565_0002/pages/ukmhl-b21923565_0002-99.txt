303 MOVABLE CARTILAGES. the cellular tissue ? Why not extract it completely when cutting down upon it? The plan of cutting down upon the cartilage and removing it has no disadvantages which the other has not, and is much simpler. With due care no air can enter the wound, and no source of irritation is left, and I have repeatedly operated in this last mentioned way with success. At the same time, there is no class of operations that I have a greater dread of than the apparently simple one of removing a loose cartilage. The case may go on most favourably, and then, when the patient is almost well, inflammation and suppuration may set in, and amputation be ultimately required. Mr. Listen, I know, had a great dislike to such operations ; he always recommended the palliative treatment instead. The operation itself is a very simple one ; but still I would always try the palliative method before removing the cartilage. In the subcutaneous method of operating we must be sure that the cartilage is quite loose and not attached by a pedicle. In the affection of the semilunar cartilages before mentioned, the palliative treatment, by fixing the joint and giving rest, is the only one that can be had recourse to ; and in many cases of movable cartilage also, the palliative treatment is perhaps the best.

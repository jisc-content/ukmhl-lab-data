032 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. the varicose. In a simple traumatic aneurism of the femoral artery in the middle region of the thigh, where some time has elapsed after the injury, the dense aponeurotic structures, confin- ing the wounded vessel and extravasated blood in a narrow space, assisted by the condensation of the surrounding cellular tissue resulting from ]plastic effusion, serve to form an amount of limitation and circumscription almost equal to the sac of a true aneurism, and to favour consolidation of the blood-clot; so that when the force of the direct blood-current is shut off, gradual consolidation and obliteration take place, as in cases of true aneurism. In traumatic varicose or arterio-venous aneurism, on the other hand, whilst we may have similar limitation as regards the surrounding parts, we must keep in mind that through the interior of the sac there is a communication more or less free with the large femoral vein; so that the retrograde current of blood will meet with no resistance in that direction. Complete consolidation of the contents of the sac could scarcely be looked for, and as the collateral circulation enlarged, the retrograde current would become stronger, and in all probability the diseased condition would be re-established. The plan generally adopted in varicose aneurisms at the bend of the arm I have already indicated as being inapplicable in the thigh ; for if surgeons avoid operating in the usual manner for ordinary traumatic aneurisms of the femoral, from dread of injury to the vein, what is only a risk in that case becomes a certainty in varicose aneurism ; because in it the artery and vein already communicate in the sac ; opening the sac, therefore, implies more or less interference with the vein, and would be followed by the usual bad results. Careful consideration of these circum- stances induced me to adopt the plan of tying the femoral artery above and below the sac, in such a manner as to avoid opening or injuring it, by the operative procedure which I have described in the case. By doing so, I trusted that all retrograde arterial circulation would be obviated, that coagulation of the contents of the sac would take place, and that the wound of the vein communicating with the sac would thus be closed, and the

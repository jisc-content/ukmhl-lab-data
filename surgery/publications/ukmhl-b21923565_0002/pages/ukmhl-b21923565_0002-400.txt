Aneurisms of the Bracliial Artery ; True and False ; Treatment—True and False Aneurisms of tlie Radial and Ulnar Arteries ; Treatment; Case—Inguinal Aneurisms—Aneurisms of the Gluteal, of the Common Iliac, of the Femoral, of the Popliteal Ai'teries—Symptoms : Diagnosis and Treatment proper to each. True Aneurism of the Brachial Artery is seldom or never met with. The treatment of such a case, should it occur, would consist either in tying the brachial some little distance above the aneurism, or in applying compression by means of a ring-tourniquet, to exercise direct compression on the artery above the aneurism, whilst the collateral circulation would be left free. False Aneurism of the Brachial used to be very frequent, when venesection was considered a universal panacea, not only for the cure but also for the prevention of disease, and when the healthy as well as the sick had themselves bled at certain periods of the year. In those days the operation was performed by gardeners, farriers, and others, with the result of supplying the surgeon with numerous cases of false aneurism at the bend of the arm, arising from puncture of the brachial artery. In the present day false aneurism at the bend of the arm is almost as rare as true aneurism in that locality. In fact, we rarely meet with it now, and almost never as the result of venesection. When present, the diagnosis is easy enough, but the appear- ance of the aneurism will differ according to circumstances. If the wound of the artery has been large, and the blood widely diffused, we have a flat irregular pulsating tumour, hard towards the circumference, and softer and with more pulsation near its centre. In one case which I saw, where the wound of the artery resulted from a stab, or rather a cut with a sharp triangular-

MA NEC'S INVESTIGA TIONS. 499 blood into lamellated tissue extends tlirougli tlie siiccessive layers of the entire substance of the coagulum ; but previously to the central portion having reached this degree of vital organisa- tion, red-coloured strife apj^ear in those parts which are nearest to the artery. These seem to be absorbent vessels, which slowly and imperceptibly take away the colorific principle of the blood, for the purpose of throwing it into the course of the general circulation ; and when this substance no longer exists, the strire lose their colour, become solid and much more resisting than before, and ultimately terminate in forming the basis of the fibrous web into which the coagulum is always changed. It is probable that each filament is formed of an obliterated vessel." M. Manec then proceeds to show the necessity of such a coagulum being present at the separation of the ligature. " During the period that inflammation is extending upon the surface of the artery, it also penetrates to the centre of each of its extremities ; but, as in this point it meets with the inflam- mation which has already taken place in the divided lips of the internal and middle membranes, its intensity is here in- creased and suppuration ensues ; and thus the adhesion uniting these parts to each other and to the base of the coagulum is always destroyed. It hence appears that the means which nature primarily employs for obliterating the vessel entirely disappears ; and at this time the coagulum and its union with the internal mevibrane offer the only preservative against consecutive hcemorrhages. The positive necessity, therefore, of the presence of a coagulum of considerable size to render the operation successful is evident, whether it shall have been performed on an artery of a large or middle size, as, for example, the crural and brachial."

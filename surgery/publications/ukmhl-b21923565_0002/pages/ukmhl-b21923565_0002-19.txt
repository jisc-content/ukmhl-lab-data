EXPLANATION OF PLATES. DISEASES OF BONES AND JOINTS.—Plate XL—Page 237. Fig. 1. Acute Necrosis of Tibia.—The limb, which was amputated on ac- count of secondary disease of the knee-joint, was minutely injected with vermilion size. The sketch shows the extremely vascular and thickened and fleshy state of the periosteum, contrasting with the white surface of the dead bone. At one point, where a scale of the external shell of the bone has separated with the periosteum, the underlying bone is seen to be highly vascular. (Sketched, from nature, by Mr. Livesay.) Fig. 2. Natural process of extrusion of a large sequestrum of the tibia. The extent of extrusion here shown was accomplished in sixteen years from the commencement of the disease. Tlie deformity of the limb from solid ccdema and deposit of new bone is well exemplified. (Sketched, from nature, by Dr. John Smith.) See Lectures. Fig. 3. Specimen of the condition termed ulceration of cartilage. The synovial membrane is iinaffected. The cartilage of incrustation is in process of ulceration, and the subjacent osseous articular surface is exposed, in a highly vascular and inflamed state. (Drawn on stone from nature.) Fig. 4. Knee-joint, exhibiting the strumous degeneration of the synovial membrane. The morbid deposit has invaded almost the entire synovial surface, covering in the articular cartilaginous surfaces, except at one or two points, and at one part has caused iilcera- tion of the cartilage, and exposure of subjacent bone.

The sequestrum is seen imprisoned and bridged over by the deposit of new bone. It was removed by dividing it with cutting-pliers, and removed in two pieces so as to save

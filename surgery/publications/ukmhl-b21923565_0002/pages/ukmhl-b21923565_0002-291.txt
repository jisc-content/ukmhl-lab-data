479 STYPTICS AND CAUTERY. cautery should be applied at a red heat only, not at a Avhite heat, lest the slough should separate too soon. It impah-s slightly the vital functions of the coats of the vessel at the injured point, a clot forms, and the circulation is arrested. But these methods are all imperfect; they are apt to cause suppuration and slough- ing, and so produce secondary haemorrhage; therefore, in all cases of wounds of arteries, the best plan is to tie the vessel above and below the wounded point with a couple of ligatures, or to employ acupressure by passing neeedles under the vessel. The reason for using a double ligature is on account of the free anastamoses between the different arteries. If we only tie the vessel above the wounded point, we partially arrest the bleeding for a time, but afterwards it comes on almost as profusely as before by the retrograde circulation from the distal opening of the vessel.

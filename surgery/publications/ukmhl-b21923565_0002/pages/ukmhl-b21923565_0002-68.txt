DISEASES OF BONES. 272 power, and we will find that a large proportion of it is composed of fine white spiculse, evidently deprived of vitality, and about to be separated from the living bone. But it is said tliat the progress of the two diseases is different; that necrosis is amenable to treatment, whilst caries is incurable. Let us examine, for a moment, into this opinion, as to the peculiarly incurable nature of " caries" in comparison with necrosis.' I apprehend that all that is meant is just this, that the actually carious portion is incurable, and of this there can be little question ; the part so diseased must either be thrown off by nature, or artificially removed ; but wherein lies the difference between it and necrosis in this respect? The part actually necrosed is also incurable, and it, too, must either be thrown off or removed before a healing process begins; at the very most, the difference is, that the carious surface possesses some slight degree of vitality, which renders the process of exfoliation or disintegration by molecular necrosis slower, and is rather a modification of diseased action from the structure of the cancellated bone in which it occurs, than a different disease. But then it may be said that there is more meant by the incurability than this, for we see that "caries" in the articular extremities of bones leads to such exhausting disease as to de- stroy the patient, or necessitate amputation or resection, much more frequently than "necrosis." This is simply to say, that from the relative position of the diseased portion of bone, general disease of the articular structures is induced, and so the patient's life endangered and severe operations necessitated. As regards the distinctive definitions, that caries implies an ulcerated surface of bone, possessing a low degree of vitality, sufficient to prevent its being thrown off, but insufficient for undergoing any healthy action, whilst necrosis indicates complete death of the affected portion,â€”these may be correct etymologically, as indicating different stages or degrees of diseased action, or rather the action and its result, and I have no objection to the terms, as used for that purpose; what I wish is, to ascertain whether

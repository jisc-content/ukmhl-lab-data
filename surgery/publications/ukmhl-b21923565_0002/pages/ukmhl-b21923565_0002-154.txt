A FRA.CTUKE generally unites in from five to six weeks. The consolidation of the bone is then pretty perfect, though the deep-seated part of the fracture is never completely consolidated till about seven weeks after the injury. Up to that time the union of the deeper part of the bone is not complete; it is still soft, and would yield readily if any weight or pressure was put on the limb. There is most danger of this yielding in fractures of the lower extremity, and hence starch bandage or other retentive apparatus should be applied after the removal of the splints. In fracture of the femur I never remove the long splint in less than seven weeks, nor allow the patient to use the limb for some time after. I have seen cases in which gradual yielding of the bone took place, and deformity occurred, from bearing weight on the limb, and this especially occurs in the young, where the bones as well as the uniting medium are still soft. In the forearm we often remove the sj)lints at the end of three or four weeks, so as to prevent any stiffness in the articulations in the neighbour- hood. We require to allow a certain amount of passive move- ment to prevent thickening, or adhesions of the tendons to their sheaths, but the patient must still be careful not to use the limb

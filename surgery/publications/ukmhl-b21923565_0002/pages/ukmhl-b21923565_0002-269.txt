The peculiar anatomical characteristics of the veins and arteries must be considered in reference to wounds and diseases of these vessels, so that we may understand how their diseases arise, and what are the principles of the treatment to be adopted. The coats of the veins differ from those of the arteries in two respects, first, in the want of the middle fibrous or muscular coat, which gives to the artery its roundness, contractility, and firm- ness, and to a certain extent its propelling power. Secondly, in the valvular arrangement of their lining membrane. The veins, however, have, like the arteries, a firm fibro-cellular external coat, and also a lining membrane, with intermediate connective areolar texture. In certain diseases we find that the areolar texture between the lining membrance and the external coat becomes very much thickened by effusion of plastic lymph, so that the venous coats, which are naturally very thin, become much firmer. A vein has not the uniform roundness of an artery, biit is irregularly distensible, and on injecting it we notice irregular sac-like dilatations, caused by this unequal dis- tension, and at certain parts are little nodulated points marking the position of the valves. An artery has for its function the propulsion of the blood

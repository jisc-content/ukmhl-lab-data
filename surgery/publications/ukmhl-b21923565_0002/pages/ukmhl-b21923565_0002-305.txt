LECTURE LXIV. Historical Sketch continned—Investigations of Sir Astley Cooper, Travers, Law- rence, and Hodgson—Teniporaiy Ligatures—Sir Charles Bell's Views—Double Ligature and Section of Artery, as recommended by John Bell, Abemethy, and Maunoir—Manec's Views. Many investigations were undertaken with a view to test the correctness of the principles advanced by Dr. Jones, and to determine, if possible, points which the results of some of his experiments seemed to indicate, and which, if correct, would remove what still appeared to be imperfections in the ligature. To mention those who took part in these investigations and discussions, would be to enumerate the names of almost every scientific surgeon of the time, and would tend to little use. The names of Hodgson, Lawrence, and Travers, stand pre-eminent among those who adopted the views of Jones ; whilst amongst the advocates of the broad ligature, we find along with Scarpa, Paletta, Crampton of Dublin, Eoux, and most of the French surgeons. The doctrine that obliteration was caused principally by the adhesive inflammation induced by the presence of the ligature, with or without the division of the arterial coats ; that this adhesion was complete within a certain time after the application of the ligature—which subsequently became not only useless but the principal cause of danger in consequence of exciting extensive suppuration in ulcerating its way out—led the advocates both of the small and broad ligature to investigate at what date adhesion was so far completed as to ensure obliteration, and whether the ligature might not then be re- moved so as to prevent ulceration taking place. In England this question was fully investigated by Sir Astley Cooper and Mr. Travers, tlie latter of whom made a series of experiments on the ligature of arteries, the results of which were published iu

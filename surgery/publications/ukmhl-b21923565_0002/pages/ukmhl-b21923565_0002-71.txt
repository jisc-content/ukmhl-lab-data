LECTURE XXXIX. Treatment of Necrosis, before, during, and after tlie separation of sequestra— Mode of conducting operations for Necrosis—After treatment—Question of amputation—Rachitis or Rickets—Mollities ossium. Whilst lecturing on acute and chronic ostitis and periostitis, I described fully the remedial measures necessary to fuliil the in- dications of treatment of the conditions which terminate in death of the bone. When the more acute action has been subdued, and when the irritative fever which accompanies it has somewhat subsided, and hectic has supervened, the treat- ment is at first limited to securing absolute rest of the limb, by laying it on a wire splint suspended from a cradle, and to careful watching so as to notice and evacuate early any abscesses which may form. We apply charcoal poultices or warm-water dressing sprinkled with carbolic acid solution or chlorinated soda lotion to the surface, to correct foetor. The patient's strength should be supported by means of nutrient diet and wine or other stimulants, according to circumstances, and the use of muriated tincture of iron in small doses. We must wait patiently until the sequestrum or exfoliation becomes loose and separated by nature, to effect which, as I have already said, several weeks at least are required. After the lapse of five to six weeks, we may examine with the probe, to ascertain if the dead portion be loose or loosening; but this should be done as seldom as possible, and no force used. It is sometimes difficult to be sure whether a sequestrum is still attached to the living bone— not fairly thrown off; or whether it is merely fixed by some process of substitute bone, or by irregularities of its deep surface caught by corresponding irregularities of the living bone. This difficxdty in diagnosis is most likely to occur in. internal necrosis, and if the sequestrum be flat. Where there are two or

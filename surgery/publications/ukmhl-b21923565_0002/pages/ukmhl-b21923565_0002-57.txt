LECTURE XXXVIIL Necrosis, Idiopathic and Traumatic ; Acute and Chronic ; Superficial and Inter- nal ; Partial and Complete—Outline of the changes and appearances ob- served at the different stages of the diseased action—Local and constitutional conditions which tend to modify that action—the Necrosis of scrofulous patients and its relation to Caries. Necrosis, or death of bone, corresponds to mortification of the soft parts. It may result from external violence either destroy- ing directly the life of the bone, as in some cases of fracture, especially gunshot fractures, or so injuring the surrounding tex- tures, that the vitality of the bone is affected secondarily, and so impaired that portions of it die and exfoliate; as we fre- quently see happen in severe injuries of the scalp, or in cases where the bone is extensively denuded of periosteum. Necrosis, however, very frequently arises idiopathically, as a result of inflammation of bone, and generally in patients of the strumous diathesis, more especially when there is also a rheu- matic complication. Necrosis, as a result of inflammation of bone or periosteum, is seen in its most marked form when the dense texture of the shaft of a long bone is affected ; and the progress of the diseased action can perhaps be most readUy studied in the acute form in which it occurs in young persons. The symptoms and mode of invasion of that form I have already spoken of in my lecture on acute ostitis and periostitis. In these cases there is diffuse and violent action, not allowing time for the dense texture of the affected bone to open out, so as to accommodate the size of the Haversian canals to the distended blood-vessels, or permit of these readily relieving themselves by effusion. The plastic exu- dation which occurs fills up the Haversian canals, presses upon and interrupts the capillary circulation, and further extends to

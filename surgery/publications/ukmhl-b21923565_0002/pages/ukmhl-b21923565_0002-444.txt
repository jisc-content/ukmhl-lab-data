620 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. but it took place in both cases about the tenth day, and resulted from the animals struggling violently with other dogs. Trom the statement as to the quantity of blood lost, however, it seems in this case either to have proceeded from the superficial femoral itself, or from ulceration of some dilated branch. I have seen the patient several times since he left the hospital; and when I last saw him, he had improved very much in his general health, so as to give me hope that his life may be prolonged for several years, whilst there is scarcely a trace of hardness or swelling at the site of the aneurismâ€”a result satisfactory, as vindicating the operation under such very unfavourable con- ditions.* In H.'s case, I attribute the recurrence of the aneurismal condition to the fact that the operation of tying the superficial femo- ral was performed while the sac was large and its contents so en- tirely fluid as to admit of the free retrograde circulation into its cavity through the articular branches arising from the diseased part of the vessel. I believe that one condition favourable to success is, that there should be a certain amount of coagn^tion within the sac before ligature, so as to obstruct or diminish the more direct ana- stomoses into its cavity, and thereby get rid of a disturbing force and favour consolidation. But in this case I was compelled to operate early during the fluid state, on account of the rapid in- crease in size of the aneurism, and its threatening to become diffuse. The recurrence of pulsation after it had been so much diminished by pressure and rest, and the sudden enlargement of the aneurismal tumour after remaining quiet so many months (I had seen the man only a week before, and there was then no perceptible change from the state in which he left the hospital), are circum- stances not easily explicable. As to the collateral vessel, which seems to have been the principal cause of restoring or keeping up the aneurismal state, I think the effects of compression of the femoral at different parts of its course prove that it must have been the anastomotica magna. In considering the question of a secondary operation, when He died suddenly tliree years after the ojieratioii.

LECTURE XL. Diseases of Joints : liow modified, according to the structure afTected ; whether Osseous, Cartilaginous, Fibrous, or Synovial, etc.—Acute Idiopathic Inflam- mation of Joints : Causes ; Symptoms ; Pathology and Treatment. Owing to the variety of textures "which enter into, or are con- nected with, the structure of articulations, you will easily under- stand that their diseases are both numerous and complicated; and whether they be regarded as to their effects on the useful- ness of the limb or the state of the general health, or both, they demand great attention from the surgeon, in reference to their diagnostic symptoms, pathology, and treatment. In investigating the symptoms and pathology of diseases of joints, as bearing on diagnosis and treatment, we must carefully bear in mind the peculiarities of the anatomy, and the greater or less degree of vitality of the different structures entering into the formation of the joint. The anatomical peculiarities of the arti- cular extremities of bones have been already noticed; but besides these peculiarities, as compared with those of the shafts of bones, we must here bear in mind their relation to the articular cartilage which encrusts them. This structure, finely organised, in one sense—for the purpose of protecting the osseous texture and admitting of free smooth motion—is of very low organisation as regards vitality. So far as the most careful modern investi- gations go, it presents neither vessels nor nerves in its intimate structure. Its nutrition seems to be entirely derived from the plasma attracted by its cells from the loops of capillaries which ramify on the surface of the articular ends of bones in connection with it. In such non-vascular structures the vitality is not only low, but also closely bound up with the condition of the neighbouring textures on which they depend for

TREATMENT OF PHLEBITIS. 463 is perfect rest, the application of leeches along the course of the inflamed vessel, and of acetate of lead and opium fomenta- tions to the part. If it be a wounded vein, poultices should be applied over the wounded point. If there be any bogginess or tension, free incisions should be made. In the diffuse form of the disease, we generally require to give stimiilants very early to support the patient's strength. In the febrile stage, opiates must be given. Formerly calomel and opium used to be given; but this remedy would probably cause absorption of any plastic effusion which might have taken place, and so prevent the disease from being localised, hence it would be more likely to do harm than good. In cases where the patient is not plethoric, muriated tincture of iron, in 15 or 20 drop doses in water, every four hours, is often very beneficial. In a great many cases, how- ever, in spite of remedies, the symptoms continue till the joint- affections come on. Secondary abscesses and pyaemia supervene, and a fatal issue occurs. In fibrinous phlebitis the local treatment is like that of ordinary inflammationâ€”leeching, punctures or incisions, and fomentations. If any abscesses form in the vein, open them without any hesitation ; for, if you neglect to do so, the pus will break down the barrier surrounding it, and serious consequences will result from the passage of the piu'ulent matter along the vein into the general circulation. After opening such abscesses in or over inflamed veins, the use of warm-water dressings and support by the many-tailed bandage, and absolute rest, form the principal indications of treatment.

CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. G33 venous circulation restored to its natural channel. So far as the artery is concerned, my expectations have been fulfilled, and the aneurism is thoroughly cured ; but judging from the present appearance of the limb, some slight obstruction to the venous circulation would seem to exist, and, though not productive of any inconvenience at present, will require to be remedied by the iise of an elastic stocking to support the returning column of blood, and so avoid any tendency to varix. From a full consideration of the general principles on which the method of operating which I have described is founded, as well as from the successful result of the. case narrated, I feel satisfied that it is the proper mode of procedure in cases of varicose aneurism. In closing, I would merely advert to the sudden and unex- pected invasion of peculiar and serious constitutional symptoms so late as the nineteenth day. I do not pretend to speak decid- edly, but my first impression when I received Dr. Dunsmure's letter was, that some small detached portion of the contents of the sac had found its way into the vein, and given rise to throm- bosis, although the favourable termination of the symptoms scarcely warrant that idea ; and, possibly, it was mere febrile disturbance, due to some irregularity in diet.

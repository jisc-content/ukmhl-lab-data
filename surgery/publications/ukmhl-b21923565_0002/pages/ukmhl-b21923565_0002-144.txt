Transverse and Oblique Fractures—Comminuted Fracture, dangers, treatment— Compound Fracture—Importance of considering the kind of force causing tlie Injury—Question of Primary Amputation—Eisks of Pyaemia and Gan- grene—Question of Secondary Amputation—Complications in Fracture. If a fracture be transverse, there is very little displacement, and no difficulty in keeping the fragments in position. In oblique fracture, the greater the obliquity of the fracture the greater is the difficulty of treating it. There is a constant tendency for the broken surfaces of the bone to glide upon one another, so that extension and counter-extension are necessary to keep them in accurate contact. Oblique fractures always give great trouble to the surgeon, and require great care and attention in treating them. To keep up a certain amount of extension, and prevent lateral movement, are the general indications of treat- ment. In some fractures, as that of the patella, all that need be done is to keep the limb on an inclined plane, and so obviate the displacing causes, and to apply a bandage so as to keep the fragments as close together as possible. In other cases of fracture the double-inclined plane is necessary, but this will be more fully treated of under special fractures. In the comminuted fracture the bone is broken up into more than one portion. Even in the simple comminuted fracture, where there is no injury of the soft parts, the danger and difficulty in treatment are much greater than in the simple frac- ture ; and the greater the amount of comminution, so much the greater are the dangers and difficulties of the case. Wlien the bone is broken into a number of small fragments, it is very difficult to keep them all exactly in position, or indeed to

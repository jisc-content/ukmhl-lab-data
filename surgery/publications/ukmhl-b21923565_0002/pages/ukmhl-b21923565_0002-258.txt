DISEASES OF MUSCLES AND TENDONS. 448 so as to enable the surgeon to keep the head back, and the face towards the side opposite to which it formerly looked. This is done by gradually tightening the lateral straps or bandages, so as to give the necessary inclination. In some cases both sterno- mastoids are contracted, and the head bent forward. In such cases both require to be divided; but in many of these, some of the other structural alterations alluded to are present, as well as contraction of the muscles, and then the operation does not much improve matters. Division of Contracted Tendons at the Knee-Joint is generally had recourse to as an accessory to other operations for contracted knee, such as the breaking up of anchylosis, or the excision of the knee where there is great contraction, to enable us to place the parts in good position. When required, the subcutaneous division of the tendons should always be the preliminary step in the operation, as their section is then more easily and surely accomplished. In dividing the outer hamstring muscle, the biceps, it should be divided near its fibular insertion, where it is narrowest; and in doing this, care must be taken to avoid the peroneal division of the great sciatic nerve, which lies in close proximity. The mode of introducing the tenotome, and stretching the tendons to be divided, is similar to that advised in section of the sterno-mastoid. After division of these tendons, in cases of contracted knee-joint, the joint is gradually straightened by the screw-lever splint re- presented in Plate xx. Fig. 2.

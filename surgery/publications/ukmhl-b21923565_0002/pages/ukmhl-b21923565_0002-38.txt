LECTURE XXXVI. Chronic Periostitis and Ostitis—Symptoms, Progress, and Pathology—Natural and morbid terminations, as Eesolntion, Supiraration, and Necrosis—Treat- ment of Acute and Clironic Periostitis and Ostitis—Of Necrosis and Suppur- ation of Bone. The symptoms of Clironic periostitis and ostitis are much the same as those of the acute form of inflammation of bone. They are slower in progress, and are otherwise slightly modified by the diseased action being less violent. There is generally a good deal of dull aching pain in the part, attended with a feeling of tension. This pain is always deep-seated and more localised, not so much diffused, as in acute ostitis. Every now and then there is an exacerbation of the disease. All the symptoms be- come more intense at these times, and then the pain, tension, and other symptoms, are very similar to those of the acute form. The febrile symptoms are not so intense in chronic periostitis, for though sometimes there is a good deal of symptomatic or irritative fever, there is almost never the great constitutional disturbance which attends the acute inflammation of bone. There are two circumstances which mark the peculiarity of the inflammation of the osseous texture both in the acute and chronic forms—namely, the exacerbation of the pain, which comes on whenever the patient gets warm in bed, and a similar result after he takes food. This symptom is the result of the excited circu- lation, and consequent distension of the bloodvessels in the unyielding texture of the bone. Both acute and chronic ostitis frequently terminate in necrosis. In the chronic form there is more time for the dense osseous texture to open out and allow the congested vessels to relieve themselves, and the diseased condition is thus so far modified. In a bone affected with chronic inflammation, the Haversian

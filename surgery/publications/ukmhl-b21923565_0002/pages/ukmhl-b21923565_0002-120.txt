LECTURE XLIV. Treatment of Morbus Coxarius, as exemplifying the treatment of ulceration of cartilage in general—Question of excision and amputation of different joints —Chronic Rheumatic Arthritis ; its history, pathology, and treatment— Hysterical affections of joints. In Morbus Coxarius, as in all other joint-diseases, the first and most important part of the local treatment consists in securing perfect rest of the affected joint. When the hip-joint is affected, that object must be attained by keeping the patient in the re- cumbent position, and the long splint must be applied so as to fix the movements of the trunk, and also of the knee and ankle joints. For this purpose I generally employ the bracketed splint shown in Fig. 4, Plate xiii., as it prevents pressure on the affected part and permits the use of local applications. The rest must be maintained for at least six or seven weeks, perhaps much longer, for in many cases the spKnt requires to be persistently retained for eight or nine weeks. If any local irritation exists, it should be soothed by the application of warm or anodyne fomentations ; and by these means, together with those which are necessary for the restoration of the general health, and which consist in the administration of good nourishing diet, cod- liver oil, and occasional tonics such as quinine or chalybeates, we may, in a great many cases, cure the disease in the earlier stage without any further treatment. The great disadvantage in the use of the long splint is, that it interferes injuriously with the general health of the patient by preventing him from getting plenty of fresh air, and at least passive exercise. Still, in the earlier stage of the disease, the risk from the patient's being con- fined to bed is less than that which would arise from using greater freedom. In order to compensate for the wants just indicaled, the bedroom must of course be well ventilated, and

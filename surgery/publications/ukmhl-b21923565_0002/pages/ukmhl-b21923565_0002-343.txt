Figure 6 of the same Plate represents a very good example of LECTURE LXVIII. Torsion—Principle on wliicli it is founded first introduced by M. Amussat—His Metliod of Operating recently revived as a Substitute for the Ligature—Acu- pressure as introduced by Sir J. Y. Simpson—Different Metliods—Wire Compress. Consecutive Hemorrhage ; Reactionary and Secondary—Causes and Treatment. Torsion, as a means of arresting htemorrhage, is founded on the observation of the natural hfemostatic process, which prevents bleeding from contused or torn arteries, and to which I have already adverted. The method, as the name implies, consists in imitating the accidental occurrence, by artificially twisting the vessel after it has been drawn out from the surrounding parts. M. Amussat was the first who tried to introduce torsion as a general method to be applied to all arteries divided in opera- tions, and laid down certain principles on which it should be performed. A very obvious objection to the method was, that in drawing out the artery from the surrounding tissues, and twisting it so as to rupture its inner coats, the tractile and twisting force employed was likely to separate the vascular connections of the artery with its sheath, consequently to impair its vitality, and lead to sloughing and secondary hfemorrhage. To obviate this risk, M. Amussat used two pairs of forcei)S— one pair with sharply grooved points to seize and twist the vessel, whilst with otlier forceps, which had flat smooth blades, he fixed the artery close to the soft parts, so as to prevent the act of torsion affecting the vessel beyond.. The effect produced by this plan is not always exactly the same, but, as a general rule, the two internal coats are ruptured, and more or less inverted, so as to project into the canal of the vessel, whilst the external coat is twisted so as to form a mechanical obstacle to the escape of blood, as represented in Figures 4 and 5, Plate xxiii.

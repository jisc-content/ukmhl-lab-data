As I have now described at some length the injuries of arteries, and natural and artificial hfemostatics, I proceed to bring before you the diseases of the arterial system and their treatment. Acute arteritis is a disease, the existence of which is still problematical. In the neighbourhood of wounds, or other sources of irritation, limited portions of the arterial walls may present the usual appearances of inflammatory action, si:ch as depositions of pus or plastic lymph within their tissues; but, as to the existence of general or extensive inflammation of the arterial coats, arising from ordinary idiopathic or constitutional causes, pathologists are not yet agreed. There is the same doubt regarding the existence of any general chronic arteritis of a simple nature, though it is becoming more and more probable that irritative action, partaking somewhat of the inflammatory character, is closely connected witli the production of certain of those degenerative changes, the evidences of which are found so commonly in the walls of arteries on post-mortem examina- tion. These degenerations, which are important to the surgeon as well as the physician, are three in number — namely, the fatty, the calcareous, and the waxy,-—the first two being closely connected in their nature and mode of origin. We need say little about the waxy, as it comes more especially within the province of the physician. It is a disease very frequently found in association with the syphilitic or other wasting dyscrasiae,

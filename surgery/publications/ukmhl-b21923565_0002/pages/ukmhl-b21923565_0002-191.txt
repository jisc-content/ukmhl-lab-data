We shall now consider the fractures occurring in the bones of the forearm, and first those of the ulna. Fracture op the Olecranon Process of the ulna is gene- rally the result of direct violence, the bone snapping across just at the middle, or nearer the point of that process. The resulting displacement is very marked. The portion broken off from the shaft of the ulna is dragged upwards by the action of the triceps muscle, leaving a distinct interval between the broken surfaces. If the arm be kept nearly straight, the interval is less visible ; but if it be flexed the gap becom.es widened, and leaves a well- marked space between the broken ends of the bone. The amount of separation will depend on the extent to which the internal lateral ligament of the elbow-joint is detached from the bone. Some of its fibres are attached near to the point of the olecranon, and if these fibres are not torn through, the inner side of the upper fragment will be kept pretty nearly in contact with the shaft of the ulna, and will not be dragged upwards by the tri- ceps. This portion of the internal lateral ligament used to be called tlie ligament of Sir Astley Cooper, who described it in his

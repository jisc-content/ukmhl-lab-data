Dislocations of the Knee-Joint are not common; when they do occur, the force causing the injury is "generally such as to necessitate amputation, for the popliteal vessels are usually much injured. In some few cases we do meet with dislocation of the condyles of the femur from the tibia without serious complication, and then our treatment is limited to attempting to reduce the dislocation and save the limb. In the first instance, even though the circulation behind the knee may be interrupted, we cannot be sure the popliteal vessels are injured, for the condyles of the femur may be pressing on them so as to stop the circulation temporarily. Lesion of the vessels does generally occur in tliis injury, but not necessarily so, and when the dislocation is not compound, that is, when there is no opening into the knee-joint, we should always try to reduce it. After the reduction the circulation should be restored at the ankle, and if it does not return soon after the pressure has been removed and the shock has passed off, then lesion of the popliteal vessels has probably occurred, and the question of amputation has to be considered. In compound dislocation we generally find the popliteal artery and vein twisted and torn from the great amount of force causing the injury, whilst there is often a considerable

POPLITEAL ANEURISM. 589 liave seen of it, I do not like the treatment by compression for popliteal aneurism, as it is uncertain in its results, and is attended with danger from sloughing and from gangrene, which may supervene. I consider that ligature of the femoral is far preferable to it. The only case in which I should adopt the treat- ment by compression at all would be in the fusiform aneurism, or in the early stage of saccular aneurism, when the contents of the sac are fluid. Flexion, along with slight compression, may be of use in the beginning of the disease, when the aneurism is still fluid, but if there be any amount of coagulum within the sac I should prefer ligature of the artery as soon as the patient was in a fit state for the operation. True aneurisms of the arteries of the leg are exceedingly rare, but erectile tumours sitxiated on the course of these arteries very closely simulate the symptoms of true aneurism. In cases of false aneurism in this region the general diagnosis is easy enough, but it is often difficult to know certainly which artery is wounded, or whether more than one vessel is im- plicated. Thus a deep stab from the fore part of the leg may wound not only the anterior tibial, but perforate the interos- seous membrane and wound the posterior also. Or a wound in- flicted from the posterior aspect of the leg may reach the anterior tibial, or, if high up, may divide the peroneal as well as the posterior tibial. On the other hand, none of the main vessels may be wounded, but the aneurismal swelling may arise from a wound of the large sural arteries. For these reasons, as regards the treatment, I have no hesitation in advising you always to adopt the direct method. Apply a tourniquet to command the circulation, and dilate the wound freely, so as to see distinctly the injured vessel or vessels, and tie above and below the wounded point.

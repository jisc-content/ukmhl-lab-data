MORBID CHANGES. 243 resisting textures. First, the effusion takes place into the loose tissue between the femur and the quadriceps extensor femoris, and is so limited. Next, the strong fascial textures resist the exuda- tion from the vessels, which gradually relieve themselves into the loose cellular tissue between the skin and fascia, and then the acute oedema supervenes long before there is any marked tension. In some cases, if the diseased action be not so severe, and if the patient be tolerably healthy—of the rheumatic rather than the strumous diathesis—the rapid death of the part may not take place, but the exudation will be poured out into the soft parts, and between the bone and the periosteum, where it can be more easily effused. This will give rise to alteration on the surface of the bone, and when the excited action has been subdued, its effects are seen in a deposition of new bone on the surface, as in tlie specimens before you. Where the diseased action goes on more slowly, the morbid changes also take place in a modified form. The inflammation affects different parts of the bone, which becomes irregularly shaped from the deposition of new osseous matter here and there. It may even be deposited in the interior, so that the bone becomes solid. In very acute cases, the death of the bone may take place through nearly its whole extent, but this is very rare, and strictly speaking never occurs, for there are always certain portions separated along with the periosteum, leaving nuclei for the formation of new bone.* Such are the symptoms of acute periostitis and ostitis. We should bear in mind that, in scrofulous patients especially, the fever which supervenes upon the symptomatic is almost con- stantly of the irritative type, and frequently complicated with diseases of other organs, especially of the kidneys and pericar- dium. * See Plate xii.

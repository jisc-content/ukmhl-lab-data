The Dislocations of the Akkle are two. One in whicli the bones of the leg are thrust forwards, while the foot is drawn back- wards. The other, in which just the opposite displacement occurs, the bones of the leg being thrust backwards, and the foot drawn forwards. The former injury is the more common of the two. It very closely resembles fracture of the malleoli, with retraction of the foot; but on careful examination we find, that the malleoli are entire, and the tibia and fibula unbroken, show- ing that there is no fracture, but simply dislocation with lacera- tion of the ligamentous textures. A very great amount of force is required to cause this injury, and it is much more com- mon to meet with the fracture than with the dislocation. When the injury does occur, however, it is easily enough recognised and treated, and it is less troublesome as regards the after-treat- ment than the fracture is. When you are about to attempt to reduce the dislocation, put the patient under chloroform, so as thereby to get rid of the opposition of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Then extend the foot, and counter-extend the bones of the leg, pushing them backwards at the same time if they are dislocated for- wards. In this way the dislocation can generally be very easily reduced, and once reduced, there is little or no tendency to dis- placement recurring, for the malleoli, which retain the astragalus in position naturally, are kept on eitlier side of it; but to avoid

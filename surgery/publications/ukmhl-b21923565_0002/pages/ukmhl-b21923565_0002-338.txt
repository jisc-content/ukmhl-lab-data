522 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. only portions of vessels previously existing, and it will be best done by tracing the manner in which this appearance occurs. In dissecting one of my preparations after ligature of both vertebral and carotid arteries, I was struck by the appearance of one of these supposed new vessels arising from the lower portion of the left carotid just below the obliterated point, ascending parallel to it, and again terminating in it immediately above the obliteration, and having no apparent communication with any other vessel. I did not even then feel satisfied of its being a new formation, because I had noticed during the dissection that it passed upwards upon the vagus nerve, and hence, although I could trace no other branches communicating with it, I suspected it to be merely a portion of one of the vessels of the sheath. That the opinion I then entertained was correct I have since had decisive proof Before proceeding to dissect the anastomoses after ligature of both carotids in another case, I first threw in a very fine-coloured size-injection, which was followed up by one composed of wax and varnish, so as to insure the injection of the most minute inosculations. As I had anticipated, the real nature of the short communicating vessels between the ends of the obliterated artery was then very readily made out. On both sides of the neck in that preparation a branch of the ascending cervical artery was seen to pass upwards along the course of the vagus lying between it and the carotid artery, more closely attached to the nerve but sending off twigs to both. Immediately on the cardiac side of the obliteration there was a very large inosculation between this ascending vessel and the vasa vasorum, and a similar anas- tomosis occurred immediately above the obliteration, and then the ascending artery became much smaller, and was gradually lost upon the vagus. Now it appears to me pretty evident that, if I had not taken the precaution I have mentioned, in injecting the vessels with size before throwing in the wax, the appearance would just have been similar to those in the former preparations. In other words, only the larger portion of this anastomosis would have been injected, and it would then have

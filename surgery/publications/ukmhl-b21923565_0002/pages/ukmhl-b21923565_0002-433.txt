CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 609 Bemarhs.â€”On dissecting the limb, the brachial artery was found to be torn across at the point corresponding to the fracture of the humerus ; a sharp point of the bone seemed to have caused the injury. There was some extravasation along the course of the vessel on the inner side of the arm, but it was limited and flattened by the fascia, so that there was not much apparent swelling during life. The occurrence of lesion of an artery in cases of simple fracture is not common, but the foregoing case, and that of Mr. B., show that it may occur ; and this risk forms one of my objec- tions to the use of the stucco or starch bandage in the early stage of fracture. Had such treatment been adopted in this case, the gangrene would have spread unnoticed till too late to admit of successful interference. 2 E

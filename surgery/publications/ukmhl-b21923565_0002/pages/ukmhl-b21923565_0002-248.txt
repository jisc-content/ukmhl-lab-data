As wounds of muscles have already been considered in the Lectures on Wounds, I shall now confine my remarks specially to EuPTURE OF Muscular Fibre, and Eupture and Division of Tendons. Partial rupture of the fibres of a muscle is not an uncommon accident. For example, when a person unaccustomed to much exercise attempts some violent exertion or pedestrian feat, or when a person stumbles and makes a sudden effort to prevent himself from falling, he may rupture muscular fibres. The sensation is as if he had received a blow on the part, say the back of the leg, which is most commonly affected, and he walks lame at the time. After rest the part feels stiff, and the patient is unable to walk without great pain. In some cases we may notice a slight discoloration at the ruptured point, though not generally so, for it is usually the deep-seated fibres of the muscles which give way. Sometimes, however, we find an indentation at the part from the very first. In the latter case symptoms show clearly what has happened, and there is little difficulty in the diagnosis of these injuries, in any case, if we examine the limb.

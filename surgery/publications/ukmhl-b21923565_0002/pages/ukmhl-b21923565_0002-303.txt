APPLICATION OF THE BROAD LIGATURE. 489 artery into complete and firm contact, not forgetting, however, that he compresses a portion of living solid." " Over the first knot he will make a second, likewise a simple one ; in making the simple knot, the surgeon is enabled to calculate the force which he employs in constricting tlie artery, which he cannot so well ascertain when he employs the double or surgeons' knot as it is called." " Having made the ligature on the artery, he will cut away the ends of tlie ligatures on a level with the skin, or will bring them towards the upper angle of the wound, and cover them with a bit of linen ; he will cleanse the wound from blood, and wash it with tepid water." He will then fill the bottom of the wound with soft lint, and cover the lips of it with a pledget of simple ointment, and place over it a compress retained by the six-headed bandage." Then, after directing the more immediate after-treatment of the patient, he goes on to say : " The insulation of the super- ficial femoral artery with the point of the finger passed behind and under that artery, corresponds nearly to the space which the two ligatures, placed near to one another, ought to occupy ; therefore, from not destroying more of the cellular substance which binds the artery to the neighbouring parts, than is necessary for placing the two ligatures, the artery continues to receive its nourishment and life immediately above and below the place of the ligature ; which is an inestimable advantage both with regard to the inflammatory course which the artery must pass through at the place of the ligature and near to it, and with regard to the desired effect depending on this inflam- mationâ€”I mean, the adhesion of the opposite sides of the tied artery to each other." Again, in speaking of ligatures of reserve, he says, " I think that, far from doing good, the placing at the upper part the so-called ligature of reserve rather does harm; for this ligature destroys a great tract of cellular sub- stance, and insulates the femoral artery more than is necessary." It seems difficult to reconcile Scarpa's views regarding the necessity of insulating the artery only in the least possible degree with his advocacy of his rules for securing and tying the vessel.

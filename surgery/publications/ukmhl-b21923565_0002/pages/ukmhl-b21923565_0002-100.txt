LECTUEE XLIL Diseases of Joints continuedâ€”Chronic Strumous Disease or Gelatinous Degenera- tion. Frequency during the period of Youth. Mildness of its Earlier com- pared with its Later Symptoms. Local and Constitutional effects. Its general Pathology and Treatment. Its Complications, and the considerations which should influence our Treatment'in connection with them. The term White Swelling was formerly used to express all joint-diseases of a clironic character. It is now understood to denote a constitutional form of disease affecting the synovial mem- branes, to which we give the name of Gelatinous Degenera- tion, or Fungus Articull This diseased condition occurs almost always in the young; seldom, if ever, for the first time, above middle age. In those cases, therefore, where it does occur in advanced life, we generally find that there has been a similar attack in early youth. The disease may assume the chronic character from the very commencement, in which case its onset is very insidious, and the symptoms are slight and vague. Or it may follow immediately on an acute attack, in which case the symptoms undergo a marked alteration in character. The swell- ing becomes less diffuse and more bulging ; and, although elastic, becomes gradually more boggy to the feel. The pain becomes greatly diminished, and the symptomatic fever gradually lessens. Gelatinous Degeneration may attack any joint in the body, but those most frequently affected by it are, the knee, the elbow, and ankle. I shall therefore take the knee-joint as an illustration, and the low chronic form of the disease, as it is by far the most common. For the first month or so the patient occasionally complains of a very slight degree of pain or uneasiness, he is a little lame, or rather awkward in his gait, from an instinctive desire to save the limb. The pain gradually increases, especially towards night,

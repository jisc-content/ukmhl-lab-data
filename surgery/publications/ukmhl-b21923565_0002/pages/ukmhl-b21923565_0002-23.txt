xvii EXPLANA TION OF THE PLA TES. Fig. 12. Side view of same apparatus. Fig. 13. Compound dislocation of ankle treated on the wire splint, slung, and ice-bags applied on each side of joint.—The wire splint is very simple, and can be bent to any angle rerpiired. DISLOCATION.—Plate XVIII.—Page 397. Fig. 1. Dislocation of the femur on the dorsum ilii, or dislocation upwards and backwards. Fig. 2. Dislocation into the ischiatic notch. Fig. 3. Dislocation on the pubis. Fig. 4. Dislocation downwards into the obturator foramen. Fig. 5. Appearances in a case of fracture of the neck of the femur. REDUCTION OF DISLOCATION.—Plate XIX.—Page 401. Fig. 1. Mode of reducing dislocation on the dorsum ilii. Fig. 2. Reduction of dislocation in the ischiatic notch. Fig. 3. Method of reducing dislocation in tlie obturator foramen. Fig. 4. Mode of reducing dislocation on the pubes. Fig.. 5. Reduction of dislocated humerus by pulling the arm over the heel placed in the axilla. INJURIES AND DISEASES OF MUSCLES AND TENDONS.— Plate XX.—Page 448. Fig. 1. Method of dividing the sterno-mastoid for cure of wry-neck. See page 447. Fig. 2. Liston's screw lever-splint, used for straightening contracted knee- joint. See pages 298 and 448. Fig. 3. Apparatus used in treating ruptured or divided tendo Acliillis.— This apparatus is also iised in tlie treatment of popliteal aneu- rism by flexion. In this latter case the bandaging of the calf of the leg is omitted. Figs. 4, 5, and 6, exhibit the deformity termed talipes equinus, and Mr. Liston's ajjparatus used after division of the tendo Achillis. Figs. 7 and 8. Two views of a child's foot afi"ected with talipes varus. Fig. 9. Operation of subcutaneous tlivision of the tendo Achillis. Fig. 10. Talipes valgus. The foot lies nearly in the position which it does in Pott's fracture. Figs. 11, 12, 13, and 14, exhibit the foot-piece recommended for the treatment of varus or valgus, as seen from the jilantar aspect.

Nearly akin to diseases of the joints proper are those affec- tions in which the hursce mucosoe are involved. We shall, there- fore, consider the diseases of burs£e before entering on the subject of fractures and dislocations. Burste are met with, in various parts of the body. They are sometimes placed deeply, in situations where muscles or tendons glide over each other or over the osseous structures underneath, and sometimes subcutaneously, where they are interposed be- tween the skin and prominences of bone. The texture in the interior of the bursa is like that of the synovial structure; it is perfectly smooth, and secretes a small quantity of fluid. Nor- mally, the bursa is composed of a very delicate texture, and around it, and forming its covering or capsule, is fibrous tissue. If we take the bursa met with over the patella as an example, we find the sac to be pretty regular in form, with a thin fibrous texture forming its outer covering, and lined by a fine, smooth, syno- vial structure, which secretes a fluid like synovia, but somewhat more limpid. The object of the bursa is to allow of free move- ment between the surface of the patella and the textures which pass in front of it, and also between the tendon and the skin. In other cases a bursa lies between strong muscular fibres or the aponeurotic texture lining muscles, or over the tuberosities of bones near articulations, such as the great trochanter of the femur. Thecal bursee are also met with, arranged along the sheaths of tendons in an elongated form, as at the wrist-joint.

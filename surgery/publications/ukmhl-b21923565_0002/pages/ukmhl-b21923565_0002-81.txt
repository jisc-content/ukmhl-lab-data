FRAGILITAS OSSIUM. 285 characterised by great brittleness. A certain degree of fragility occurs naturally in old age. This is due to the altered relative proportions of animal and earthy constituents of which bone is composed at that period of life. That condition is much aggra- vated by the co-existence of certain forms of diseaseâ€”such as rheumatism. It may also occur purely as a consequence of disease, and that at any period of life. In these cases the bone assumes a friable condition, and may snap across from the slight- est cause, even from the simple action of the muscles, constituting in that case what is sometimes termed spontaneous fracture. In cancerous affections this fragility is often present, consequent upon the deposit of cancerous matter in the structure of the bone. When fracture does occur under these circumstances, union is always slow and imperfect, if indeed it take place at all. The Treatment must be preventive and palliative, for we cannot avert or arrest the alterations in the osseous tissue. The diet must be nutritious, and the patient cautioned against making any exertion lest fracture should occur. The fractured parts must be kept at perfect rest.

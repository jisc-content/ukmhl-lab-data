REVIEW OF VARIOUS OPINIONS. 503 essential, and indeed no one now doubts that the adhesive process between the coats of an artery, and consequent oblitera- tion, may be effected without division of the internal coats of the vessel. This fact, however, by no means proves the correctness of Scarpa's doctrine as to the use of the broad ligature, for experience has shown that the complete division of the internal coats of the vessel by the small ligature really involves no risk, whilst, in respect to other points admitted by all parties, its advantages are incontestable. Laying aside, then, the advantages gained or risk incurred by the division of the internal coats, we find that both Scarpa and Jones agree as to the two great essentials necessary to obliteration of an artery :â€”\st, The excitement of inflammation, causing effusion and adhesion between its coats ; 2d, The preservation of the vasa vasorum as the source from which the arterial tunics are to receive their nutrition, and that vitality on which will depend the ability of the vessel to undergo the changes necessary in the process of obliteration. Both Scarpa and Jones seem to consider the clot as merely incidental. The expressions I have quoted from Sir Charles Bell's writings seem to indicate that, in his opinion, the formation of a coagulum within the vessel was essen- tial to cause obliteration. Manec is decided in expressing his opinion as to the clot being absolutely essential, for he states that his experiments led him to believe that the ulcerative process necessary for the separation of the ligature extends to and destroys the recent adhesions between the internal coats. And in the passages I have quoted he has pointed out carefully the successive steps in the formation and gradual organisation of the clot. Having now presented a pretty full statement of the principal opinions at present held regarding the changes induced on an artery by the action of the ligature, and what parts of the pro- cess are absolutely essential, I shall next proceed to give you the results of my own experiments on this subject, and the views which these have led me to adopt as to the parts of the process absolutely essential to safe obliteration. I shall also state in

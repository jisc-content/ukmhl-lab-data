NECROSIS. 271 specimen of incipiemt necrosis of the popliteal surface of the femur, we find the affected part of a brownish colour, of more granular appearance, and more friable than natural, but still possessing some vitality; and making allowance for the natu- rally denser texture, not much unlike the surface of bone exposed in articular caries. Again, in advanced stages of articular caries itself, we often find large exfoliations or sequestra of the cancellated structure separating, constituting necrosis. In certain bones, especially the lower jaw and tibia, we meet with what has long been termed molecular necrosis: that is, the dead surface gradually becoming dis- integrated, and being thrown off in particles so minute, as to be almost imperceptible, until the whole diseased portion is eliminated and a healthy surface left. In cario-necrosis, as it is termed, we have a combination of the two conditions in the different textures of the same bone, showing that it is the texture which modifies the diseased action. Thus, in the bones of the tarsus and carpus, the cancellated portion presents the appearance described as caries, whilst the denser fibrous lamella is completely dead and exfoliating. We meet with this condition also in some rare cases in the shaft of long bones, where the bone has undergone chronic alteration of structure, and has become opened out in texture, so as somewhat to resemble cancellated bone, and presents an unhealthy friable appearance with small patches of exfoliation at different points, and scarcely any attempts at repair or deposition of new bone. I have a very perfect specimen of this rare form, which occurred in a lad whose case I have already adverted to. Another very rare specimen in my possession shows the effect of diseased action simultaneously affecting the whole extent of the femur, from the hip to the knee-joint, in a young girl; here the form of disease, as depending on structure, is beau- tifully seen, the dense shaft has been rapidly deprived of vitality, whilst the head and condyles are in a state of cario- necrosis. Lastly, let us return to the ordinary carious articular surface, and examine it more closely with a low magnifying

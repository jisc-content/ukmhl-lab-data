The condition termed Varix consists in dilatation of the veins, with impairment or destruction of the function of tlieir valves, rendering them incompetent to support the column of blood. Other neighbouring veins become secondarily involved, till at last the limb affected with the varix has its veins distended and tortuous, and forming nodulated masses at different points. Between the tortuosities of the veins we generally meet with portions which are less affected or even healthy. The vein most frequently affected with varix is the internal saphena. At first there is dilatation, and rounded projections corresponding to the position of its different valves, and gradually the vein becomes thickened and tortuous. On examining a vein in this condition, we find the valves shortened and thickened, as a consequence of alteration of the lining membrane, which forms the projecting portion of the valve. Varix is most frequent in the lower extremity, but is occasionally met with in the arm, arising from some peculiar cause, such as the pressure of an aneurism or other tumour on the veins of the arm, and also in some diseases of the chest and of the heart. The disease likewise occurs in the hfemorrhoidal veins, and then constitutes what are called heemorrhoids or piles, which are originally a varicose condition of these veins. Any cause which obstructs the returning venous circulation may lead to varix. It is stated to be more frequent in the left

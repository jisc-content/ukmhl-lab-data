502 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. to what are the best means of producing the same effects, than a difference of opinion as to the cause which he considered essential to obliteration. Both Jones and Scarpa point to the adhesive inflammation between tlie internal coats of the vessel, excited by the ligature, as the principal caiise of permanent obliteration. And both insist equally on the value of the vessels of the sheath, (the vasa vasorum) as the source of the vitality of the artery, and consequently on the necessity of avoiding all unnecessary injury of these vessels. It is true that those who advocated Scarpa's plan of the broad ligature, in opposition to that of the small ligature recommended by Dr. Jones, seem to point to the division of the internal coats of the vessel described by Jones as the main difference and the principal point to be avoided. But Scarpa himself, when, speaking of the broad ligature, whilst he insists upon the integrity of all the coats as one advantage, also points out what he considers another advantage—namely, the preservation of the vessels of the arterial coats from undue constriction—and is accordingly very particular in his directions as to tying the vessel sufficiently tight to flatten and bring its internal surfaces into contact, but not so tight as to constrict the vasa vasorum or divide the coats. From what has been stated, the fallacy of Scarpa's practical deductions would, I believe, have been more readily recognised, had Dr. Jones and his followers, instead of insisting on the division of the two internal coats effected by the small round ligature as one of the essentials to obliteration of the vessel, contented themselves with pointing out that this result of the small ligature effected adhesion of the divided surfaces in its simplest form; whilst, from causing little disturbance of the sheath, the small ligature better preserved the integrity of the nutrient vessels of the artery; and that these advantages greatly overbalanced the supposed risk of dividing the internal tunics. Though all ligatures, even the broad ligature of Scarpa, pro- duce division more or less complete of the internal coats, still there are sufficient facts to prove the statements of Bichat and Scarpa, and their followers, that this is not absolutely

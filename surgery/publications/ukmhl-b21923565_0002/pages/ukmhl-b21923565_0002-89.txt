In traumatic inflammation, arising when a joint is wounded by a puncture or incision, the local symptoms are not severe at first, and there is little or no constitutional disturbance. At the end of thirty-six or forty-eight hours, however, pain comes on and spreads over the joint, which soon presents a considerable amount of swelling and tension. Tlie wound may ulcerate and break open, allowing some synovial fluid to escape, which so far relieves the tension ; but the in- flammation still proceeds, and general swelling of the limb occurs. This is accompanied or followed by great constitutional disturbance. The pulse rises in frequency, and becomes altered in character. Eigors of greater or less severity come on, and succeed each other rapidly, and the fever presents a truly irritative character. The secretion flowing from the wound becomes unhealthy and purulent, and abscesses begin to form in the cellular tissue around the joint and between the muscles. There is much excited action; but great debility present at the same time. In a great many of these cases the result is fatal; the irritative fever proceeds, and the patient dies with symptoms of acute pysemia. Occasionally, however, the patient may struggle through and recover. The old plan of treatment consisted in the application of warm fomentations and active depletion. These means may arrest the more acute symptoms, but they are seldom of much efficacy^

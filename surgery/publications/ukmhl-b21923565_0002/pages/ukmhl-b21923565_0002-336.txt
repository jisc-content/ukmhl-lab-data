620 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. expect from examination of preparations made at a later period. This increase of the general vascularity is constant, and I have proved it not only by dissections of minutely-injected parts, but also by observing the great difference in the amount of bleeding which takes place on cutting down upon one carotid artery some days after the opposite vessel had been secured. In the normal state of parts there is scarcely any bleeding, whilst in the cases where one of the arteries has been previously tied, the general arterial hasmorrhage is very copious, and vessels of the skin and other tissues often bleed per saltuvi. At a later period, from the fourth to the eighth week, the vascularity be- comes less general, and the more direct collateral inosculations are now found to be very considerably enlarged, sometimes to three or four times their natural size ; whilst their parietes are tender, more easily torn, as if thinner in structure in consequence of distension. The vessels which are then principally enlarged are the primary and direct collateral arteries, and their anastomoses, and some of the secondary collateral inosculations, as those com- municating with the vasa vasomm, and the neiirilemmal vessels of the larger nerves accompanying the artery which has been tied, or existing in its immediate vicinity. At this period the cir- culation has been completely re-established, filling the tied vessel above and below the obliterated point; and, as 1 have elsewhere stated, not only beyond the collateral inosculations on either side, but also between them and the part tied, where there is a long portion of the artery without collateral branches. After a still greater lapse of time, the primary and direct anastomoses form generally the only remarkable vessels, and even they, I am led to believe from my own observations and dissections, gradually decrease, with the exception of perhaps a few of the most direct. At least they certainly do not increase in size after the eighth week ; for in the preparations I have dissected at a considerable period after ligature, the anastomoses, with two or three excep- tions, were not so large or numerous as in similar dissections where the animal had been killed at the end of six or eight Aveeks after tlie arteries had been tied.

ANEURISM. 543 gradual dilatation and bulging of the external fibro-cellnlar coat. In the Fusiform Variety the diseased condition of the artery is that of general fatty degeneration, which soon causes it to lose its elasticity and power of reacting upon and pro- pelling the blood. It therefore gives way before the pressure of its contents, and at the weakest part a dilatation takes place, which gradually assumes an ovoid or fusiform shape. By-and- by the internal lining coat of the artery becomes roughened by little masses of atheromatous and calcareous deposit, which form beneath it, and in course of time give a coarse granular appear- ance to the interior of the sac. This is generally a very un- favourable form of aneurism, for there is in most cases the same diseased condition which produced it existing throughout tlie whole arterial system, though to a less extent than in the par- ticular artery affected. The following points are important as characteristic of this variety ;â€”the vessel dilates with compara- tive slowness; the aneurism is, as a rule, easily emptied of its contents by pressure; the pulsation is very distinct and very equal; and there is present in it a hridt of a peculiar kind, different from that heard in other varieties ; the vessel above and below the dilated point is generally thickened, but is still able to react upon the blood passing through it; the lining mem- brane is in the first instance smooth, and the tendency of the blood to coagulate on its surface is small, for the cavity is not very much dilated, and the current of blood passes through it in a direct and continuous stream. In the Lateral or Sacculated True Aneurism we have ulceration of the two internal coats of the artery, and gradual dila- tation of the outer or fibro-cellular coat. This aneurism generally arises from some atheromatous or earthy deposit taking place between the internal and middle coats of the vessel, which leads to irritation of the part, and ultimately, as already described, to ulceration. Probably the increased amount of friction from the current of blood to which the atheromatous patch is exposed may be one of the causes leading to ulceration of its lining

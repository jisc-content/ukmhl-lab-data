Fractures of the Shaft of the Humerus are of very com- mon occurrence, and, as a rule, very easy of diagnosis. They are generally accompanied by a marked shortening and distortion of the limb, and, in most cases, crejoitus can be readily elicited. When the fracture occurs between the insertions of the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi above, and the deltoid below, the dis- placement is almost always in one direction. The two former muscles draw the upper portion of the bone towards the chest; whilst the latter, acting on the lower portion, draws it upwards and partly outwards, so that it lies to the outer side of the upper part of the bone. In such a case no special treatment is required ; all that is necessary, after adjusting the fracture is to apply well-padded splints on the outer and inner sides of the arm (Plate xvi. Fig. 7). The arm should be flexed at right angles, but the elbow unsupported by the sling, so that the upper arm may be allowed to hang straight down. If this treatment be maintained, there will be no great danger of displacement recurring. When the fracture happens near the middle of the humerus, the displacement differs in different cases, being gene- rally regulated by the direction of the obliquity, so that, if the fracture be transverse, there is often little or no displacement. In an oblique fracture the fragments glide in one or other direction, according to the direction of the oblique surfaces, so that the muscles by their contraction simply produce short-

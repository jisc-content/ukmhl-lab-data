LECTURE XXXVII. Ulceration of bone—Caries, definitions ; patliological appearances ; prognosis ; treatment—Acute Curvature of the Spine, a result of deeply-seated Caries —Early manifestations and later symptoms of tlie disease—Treatment by constitutional measures ; by mechanical appliances. Ulceration of bone may take place as a result of inflammation as in the softer tissues, but it is attended witb peculiarities arising from the structure of bone, and from certain constitutional conditions under which it is most liable to occur. The exudation thrown out in the dense texture of inflamed bone interferes with nutritive action, and hence, when ulcer- ation of bone has taken place, even in its simplest form, the healing process is slower than in the softer tissues. In cases, however, where there is no constitutional predisposing cause, simple ulcer of bone heals favourably. For example, when, from some local injury, abrasion of the periosteum has oc- curred, followed by inflammation and superficial ulceration of the bone, or when chronic ulcer of the soft parts over a superficial bone, as the tibia, has led to ulceration—under proper treatment, as by simple water-dressing or some slightly stimulating lotion, in such cases the surface granulates, a fibrous texture covers it in, and the soft parts close over it by secondary union. Again, in cases where pressure from a tumour or aneurism has led to ulcerative absorption of neighbouring bone, the diseased action is arrested so soon as the pressure is removed ; there being no special cause in the bone itself preventing the healing pro- cess. These may be taken as examples of simple ulceration of bone, and they should be carefully distinguished from the form of ulceration termed Caries. Unfortunately, that term has been very indiscriminately applied to all ulceration of bone, without much regard to the pathological conditions ; and some of

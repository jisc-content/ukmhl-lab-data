UlSeration of Cartilage—The Characters, Symptoms, Progress, and Pathology of the Disease—Distinctions between Ulceration of Articular Cartilage and Gela- tinous Degeneration—Primary and Secondary Affections of Cartilage : Danger of confounding them with Disease of Osseous Textures—Aids to Diagnosis— Morbus Coxarius : its Manifestations, Progress, Diagnosis, and Pathology. The cartilage of incrustation, although an organised struc- ture, is endowed with but feeble vitality, and is thus all the more liable to become affected by disease. It is of a firm, durable consistence, by which property it is well fitted to protect the articular surfaces from the tear and wear of ordinary action. It has an elasticity which adapts it for meeting the contin- gencies arising from concussion, and its surface is smoothly polished so as to lessen friction and ease the motions of the joint. In its intimate structure it is destitute of nerves and bloodvessels, and it therefore possesses little vitality and no sensibility. Thus, it is admirably adapted for its functions, which are chiefly of a protective kind, and for which the simple qualities of resistance and endurance are mainly requisite. What little nutrition is required for the maintenance of such a low type of structure, the cartilage derives second-hand by im- bibition from the tissues in its neighbourhood; and on the integrity of these, therefore, does its soundness depend, so that when they are involved in disease the cartilage is apt to become implicated secondarily. Sometimes, however, the cartilage is the seat of the primary affection, when it becomes diseased inde- pendently of the neighbouring textures. Ulceration of the cartilage was described as a special form of disease by Sir Benjamin Brodie, though it was formerly known by the general term of white swelling, one of the stages of which ii was supposed to be. Brodie pointed out that there were

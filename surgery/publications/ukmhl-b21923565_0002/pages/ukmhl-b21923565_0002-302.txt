488 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF BLOODVESSELS. of tlie muscle of the fascia lata, wliicli covers the course of the superficial femoral artery; then, with another stroke of the bistoury, with his hand free and unsupported, or on a furrowed probe, he will divide along the thigh and in the same direction as the external wound the thin aponeurosis just mentioned, and introducinrj the forefinger of his left hand into the bottom of the incision, he will immediately feel the strong beating of the superficial femoral artery, and this, without the necessity of removing the internal margin of the sartorius muscle from its position, or at least very little." " With the point of the forefinc/cr of the left hand already touching the femoral artery, the surgeon will separate this artery from the cellular substance which ties it laterally and posteriorly to the contiguous muscles ; making the point of the same finger pass gradually under and behind the superficial femoral artery (supposing the surgeon has not enormously large fingers), he will raise it alone from the bottom of the wound, or, when it cannot be avoided, along with the great femoral vein." " If it is along with the femoral vein, holding the artery and vein thus raised, and almost without the wound, the surgeon, with a bistoury or spatula, or simply with the fingers of his right hand, will cautiously separate the vein from the artery, only in the space corresponding to the point of the finger which supports the artery." " He will then pass behind the denuded raised artery a large-eyed crooked needle, with a blunt point, carrying in the eye near to the point two waxed ligatures each composed of six threads." After this the surgeon will withdraw the forefinger of his left hand, on the point of which he kept the femoral artery raised from the bottom of the wound, and will proceed to the ligature of the artery." " He will stretch the two extremities of the tapes, in order to place them near each other ; he will then make with each a simple knot, and before tightening it on the artery, he will place between it and the knot a small cylinder of linen rolled up, six lines in length and three in breadth, over which cylinder he will tighten both ligatures with a simple knot, and with such a degree of force as he thinks necessary to bring the opposite sides of the femoral

52 Isas been suggested by one of our friends, and favourably received. The course of proceeding we have adopted may be tedious; it may be some time before we can ac- complish the changes we have in view, or we may not be able to bring about any effectual alteration. It would be in our power to convince the public that our motives are not selfish, but that our object is to elevate our pro- fession by advancing the sciences on which it is founded, and thus increasing its claims to respect. The Members of the College of Surgeons, exclusive of the council, might form an association for what has hitherto been hardly attempted, the cultivation of the medical art in the most comprehensive sense of that term, on scientific principles, as a branch of experimental knowledge, without any reference to the doctrines of the schools. To form a Museum of pathological anatomy for illustrating the changes which disease produces in the structures of the body; to bring together the results of their experience in hospital or other practice, for the pur- pose of shewing how changes of structure occur, how their formation is indicated, and how they may be re- moved; to publish these from time to time; and to form a comprehensive medical library, would be the purposes to which such a society might direct its labours, most usefully for its members, for the profession, and the public. The united efforts of the numerous active and enterprizing surgeons in London, and in all parts of England, when directed to such objects, could not fail to accomplish results of the highest importance in the neglected department of general pathology, as well as in the more limited sphere of surgery strictly so called.

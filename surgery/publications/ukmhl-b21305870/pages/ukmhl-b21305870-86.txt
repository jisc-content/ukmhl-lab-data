74 required, in order to be admitted to the degree of Doctor Medicine. This entitles me to a similar rank in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and would ena- ble me to become a Fellow of the College of Physicians, were I disposed to discontinue the practice of surgery. I commenced the study of anatomy and surgery in 1815, and having-followed, during five years, the courses of lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and attended during the same period the prac- tice of the Richmond hospital, I received, in 1820, the diploma of Member of that body; on which occasion I submitted to two public examinations. I have since had the honour to be admitted a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. In the year 1822, I went to Paris, in order to improve myself further, and with the repeatedly-avowed intention of subsequently establishing myself in London as a teacher. I spent three years there as the pupil of such distinguished characters as M. M. Blainville, Beclard, Laennec, Dupuytren, &c. &c. and during the same pe- riod was employed in teaching to a considerable class of British students, anatomy, physiology, pathology, and surgery. I should further observe, that those who honoured me by being my pupils were not ordinary stu- dents, but men far advanced in their studies, seven- eighths of them, at least, being Doctors of Medicine, or Members of Colleges of Surgeons. With such testimonials, therefore, and such oppor- tunities of acquiring a knowledge of my profession, I confidently trust the Court will deem me competent to teach anatomy and surgery. If they require a further test of my ability, I shall willingly submit to a public examination. I now most respectfully beg leave to state, that I conceive my case to be a* worthy of exception

43 at which, and the persons by whom knowledge shall be communicated, they are not unreasonable either in the number of studies or the time required to complete them. All that the foregoing resolution requires, can be accom- plished in rather less than sixteen months; that is the time necessary for three winter courses of anatomical lectures; the two winter courses of dissections occupy only seven months. Undoubtedly it is of the greatest consequence;â€” it is absolutely necessary that the surgeon should be thoroughly conversant with the structure of the human body; but why require that he should attend three courses of lectures on anatomy ? You know, Gentlemen, that anatomical knowledge cannot be gained from lec- tures; you must know', that all your information on this subject has been acquired, not in the lecture room, but in the dissecting room. To learn the structure of the human frame, is an affair of the hands and the eyes, not of the ears. An anatomical lecturer sometimes has an audience of two or three hundred students, or even more. To how many of these can he actually shew the parts on which he is lecturing? Perhaps to twenty, and to them only in a very imperfect manner. The repeated and deliberate examination, in various points of view, neces- sary to the comprehension of an intricate structure, the questions and answers arising out of imperfect under- standing, are quite incompatible with the plan of lec- turing. What should you think of teaching carpentry or watchmaking by lectures? It has indeed been, and it still is a prevalent notion, that anatomy is to be taught by lecturing; but I beg to state to you, that, in my opinion, it would be most favourable to the diffusion of anatomical knowledge, to abandon that course altogether. I think it, indeed, a delusion on the public, to attempt

In all the public courses of medicine and surgery, an examination of the enrolled students is held by the seve- ral professors every half-year, in presence of one or more of the other office-bearers of the University. In order to be admitted to examination for a degree in medicine, the candidate must produce certificates of having acquitted himself respectably in three semestral examinations, of having completed his fifth year of study, and of having publicly treated within the last half-year two patients in the clinic for internal diseases, the cases of which patients he must at the same time present to the faculty, written in Latin. He who aspires to the degree ofMagister Chirurgiee, a rank analogous to that of member of one of our Col- leges, is obliged to follow nearly the same course of study as the candidate for a degree in medicine. It is different in regard to the common civil and country surgeons, as they are called. These study only two years ; and so far from being required, are scarcely admitted to attend the lectures and clinic of Professor Von Hildenbrand, or the lectures in Latin of Professors Prochaska and Hart- mann. Neither in Austria, nor, so far as we have seen, in any part of Germany, is this class of surgeons respect- able. They are inferior to the officiers de sante of France, still retain the helmet of Mambrino, and execute at once the duties of barbers and surgeons.

The candidate describes the surgical anatomy of the parts, lays down the indications for the operations, r .-r-'-'r iir».r^r TTBT ■ _

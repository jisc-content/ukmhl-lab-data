So would Mr. Cruiksbank, the author of the admirable history of the absorbents; so would that indefatigable and accom- plished anatomist, the late Mr. Wilson ; so would the present able professor of anatomy and surgery to our College, Mr. Bell, up to the time of his being appointed surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital. If I were to place in contrast with those who would have been thus pro- scribed, a list of the individuals who would have been favoured and honoured, the absurdity of the regulation would be rendered so apparent as to excite your contempt and derision, unless the injury to science and to the cha- racter of our country should rouse the stronger feeling of indignation. Let me observe further, that the practice which has hitherto prevailed, of confining the teaching of anatomy to hospital surgeons, and which the hospital surgeons, who compose the Court of Examiners, are now endeavour- ing to establish exclusively and enforce rigidly, must have been the principal cause of the low state to which ana- tomical science has fallen in the country of the Hunters, of Hewson, and of Cruikshank. The urgent and impera- tive duties of the hospital surgeon do not leave him the time required for adequately cultivating and properly teaching anatomy ; he therefore restricts his instructions to the points of principal consequence in relation to sur- gery, and too often excuses his neglect of the rest by representing them as unimportant, thus sanctioning in his pupils a habit of superficial and imperfect study. All the parts of anatomy are so intimately connected, that it par- ticularly requires to be studied as a whole; no one organ or system of organs can be thoroughly understood, with- out a general insight into the frame. Hence, when many parts are slurred over or neglected, because they are un- /

119 of Mr. Hunter; as is proved by his hand-writing in many parts of them. The transcript must have appeared to the Curators, and must be allowed, by every one, to contain a very excellent and perfect account of Mr. Hunter’s views and opinions in the formation of his collection; though it must also appear very deficient in the explana- tion of the individual preparations. “ No one, however, supposed until within a short time, that Mr. Hunter left any other writings of importance, explanatory of his collection, than the before-mentioned two catalogues. “ On the completion of the Museum, and the admis- sion of visitors, the want of a descriptive catalogue was soon felt and expressed; and the Board of Curators, in the year 1813, prepared a printed syllabus, to gratify scientific inquirers. “ The Curators also consulted Dr. Shaw, who, at the instance of the Board, prepared a third catalogue of ob- jects in the department of natural history. “ A descriptive catalogue of the preparations, which was earnestly desired by the trustees, has ever been a desideratum of great interest and consideration to the Board of Curators, as may be seen by its minutes. “ The Board regarded Sir Everard Home, as execu- tor of Mr. Hunter, to be the person most proper, and best qualified to undertake the task of preparing the cata- logue; which he repeatedly engaged to do. “ At length, in 1816, it was proposed that all the Curators should become joint labourers, in this great work ; when Sir Everard Home declared, that it was his special duty, and that he would admit of no participation in its performance. The result of his labours was the production of a Synopsis, which, doubtless, the members of the Council have perused.

15 deemed less important by the Court of Examiners than the school he attended and the professors who taught him? Let us consider, gentlemen, the qualifications neces- incorrect, so far as Glasgow is concerned, and in learning that that University is not less fortunate in possessing the means of practical anatomical study than in the talents and reputation of its able ana- tomical teachers. I can assure your Correspondents that I do not yield to them in respect for the names of J. and A. Burns, of Jeffray, Patti- son, Mackenzie, and Monteath.

That the representation in the text is correct, so far as Edinburgh is concerned, is clearly proved by the strong and competent testimony of Mr. Lizars. In the prefaces to the second, fourth, and ninth num- bers of his anatomical plates, he laments the want of subjects in Edin- burgh; he comments indignantly on the public authorities, accusing

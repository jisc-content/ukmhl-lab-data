26 fusion of useful knowledge. This reasonable hope has not been realized. Even the members of the College have only a very limited access to it. During eight months of the year, it is closed; and for the remaining four months it is open to the general body of the pro- fession only twice a week, and for four hours on each of the days. Could you believe, Gentlemen, that the Court of the College have refused permission to have drawings taken of the specimens, and that to a public teacher of the highest scientific character, who gives one of the most important courses of lectures delivered in this island, and sufficiently evinces his zeal in the cause of science, by keeping regularly in his pay a draftsman, whom he sent from Scotland to London for this very pur- pose? Surely the Court must have forgotten, that they hold the collection only as trustees for the public; that it is not their own private property; and that unless it be available for such purposes, it possesses no utility what- ever. In order to employ the Museum advantageously, the general body of members should have daily access to it, at reasonable hours: they should have liberty to examine the preparations, and make drawings of them. The collection should be thrown open to all members of the medical profession who come from other countries. In short, to scientific persons, whether natives or foreigners, should be allowed the freest access, and the most en- larged use, of the Museum, subject to those regula- tions only, which its safety requires. In other countries too the public at large are allowed to visit occasionally such collections, which are thus rendered useful, not only for the more enlarged purpose of advancing science, but also as a means of exciting a taste for natural know- ledge, and awakening and gratifying rational curiosity on subjects most important and interesting to every indi-

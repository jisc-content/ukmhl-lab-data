Ill America, as they are ail formed upon the same model-â€” ********* * ********** Your obedient and obliged servant, J. P. To Wm. Lawrence, Esq. Whitehall Place. The course of lectures in the university of Maryland continues for four months, commencing on^ the first of November, and terminating on the last of February. The medical professorships are seven in number, viz. anatomy, surgery, chemistry, practice of medicine, insti- tutes of medicine, materia medica, and obstetrics. Daily lectures are delivered on the four first subjects: those on the institutes, materia medica, and midwifery, are given only three times a week. The anatomical lectures are not confined to the healthy structure of the parts, but embrace likewise the changes produced by the operation of disease. Those morbid changes are amply illustrated by the preparations in the valuable museum which was left to Professor Pattison by the late Allan Burns, and by many others, which have been added to the collection since the death of that anatomist. Before a student can present himself for examination, he is required to attend two courses of lectures on ana- tomy, surgery, chemistry, and practice of medicine; and one course on materia medica, midwifery, and the insti- tutes of medicine; but, as gratuitous admission is granted to all the lectures, after an attendance of two courses, the majority of students attend three years at the university, before they present themselves for examination.

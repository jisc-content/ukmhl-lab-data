The course of study described above may be followed at Paris, Strasburg, or Montpellier; and the Faculty of Medicine, at each of these places, is empowered to exa- mine candidates and grant degrees. The course of study is the same, whether the person means to practise medi- cine or surgery; and there is only one degree, under which any branch of the healing art may be practised. There is an inferior description of medical practi- tioners, called “ officiers de sante,” who are not obliged to study more than three years, and who practise under certain restrictions. It is not necessary for them to re- sort to Paris, Strasburg, or Montpellier; they may pursue their professional studies at what are called the secondary schools of other cities. They are examined, before being admitted to practice, by commissioners from one of the Faculties of Medicine, who visit the secondary schools for that purpose at stated periods.

6 Anatomy, one course of Surgery, and one of Dissections, as specified. “ By order: “ Edmund Belfour, Secretary. “ 19th day of March, 1824. “ Candidates are to observe that Tickets of Admission only, will siot be received as Certificates or Evidences of attendance.*” * The Court of Examiners, by whom this regulation was made and published, consisted of Sir D. Dundas W. Norris, Esq. T. Forster, Esq. Sir Everard Home Sir Ludford Harvey Sir W. Blizard Sir A. Cooper J. Abernethy, Esq. W. Lynn, Esq. H.

The revised and corrected edition, on which the latest labours of the learned body have been bestowed, is still more contemptible as a literary production, and rather more confused and obscure than the original.

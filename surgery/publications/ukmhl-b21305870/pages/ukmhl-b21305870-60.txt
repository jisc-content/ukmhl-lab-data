48 that the public do not set so high a value on this kind of learned ignorance as themselves. It is not our province, Gentlemen, to consider the education of physicians; let us allow them to be the best judges of their own affairs. If they determine that a knowledge of surgery is not only useless but even injurious to them, be it so. You will, I am sure, agree with me that a surgeon ought to under- stand medicine thoroughly; and that, in proportion as his knowledge of the whole science is more extensive and accurate, will he be better prepared for the particular duties of his own department. The denomination of pure surgeon, which some so highly value, has become rather a term of ridicule and contempt. It implies, not a higher, but a lower degree of knowledge and utility. Pure! free from what? From all knowledge of medi- cine! If we wish to deserve and retain public respect, let us reject the imputation of such purity. After receiving a general medical education, different persons may be led by taste, convenience, or various other considerations, to select one part of the profession rather than another; this is a matter of subsequent choice, and ought not to regulate scientific education. In large communities it may be advantageous to patients and to the progress of science, that the established distinctions in the profession should be maintained, provided there is no anxiety to draw the line very narrowly. Indeed, the latter attempt, which is in itself absurd, and grounded on no principle of utility, is very little likely to be encou- raged by the public, on whom it could only operate as a limitation of choice; preventing them, on many occasions, from having recourse to that professional assistance, in which they might be disposed to confide. Let us hope then, Gentlemen, that the notions of the College, respecting surgical education, will no longer

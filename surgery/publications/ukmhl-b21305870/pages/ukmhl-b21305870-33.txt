21 to me, that persons sincerely desirous of improving the means of anatomical instruction, and having no other motive in view, would never have proposed to limit the right of teaching it to Hospital Surgeons. The duties which devolve on these gentlemen, if rightly performed towards the patients and the students, require the devo- tion of a great portion of their time. Again, it generally happens, as might reasonably be expected, that hospital surgeons enjoy extensive private practice. Hence the surgeon of a large hospital is by no means the individual best fitted for teaching anatomy : without considering ability or the power of imparting knowledge, his other important duties do not leave him the command of time necessary for the purpose. As an instructive commen- tary on the policy of this very regulation, I may observe, that they who have been most distinguished among us for anatomical knowledge, and on whom the character of the country, in respect to this science, must depend, have all belonged to a school, which would have been abso- lutely proscribed by its provisions; which, in short, could never have existed, had this enactment been in force. William Hunter, the greatest character whom England has produced in human anatomy, and inferior to no man in any country for the variety and extent of his contribu- tions to anatomical and physiological science, and for that combination of genius and acquired knowledge, which have caused his name to be venerated wherever these sciences are held in respect, could not, under the present laws of the College, have founded the school which has immortalized his own name, and reflected so much credit on his country. His pupil and associate, Mr. Hewson, who has shewn, in his valuable contributions to anatomical science, and particularly in his discovery of the absorbing vessels in birds, that he had imbibed the spirit of his great

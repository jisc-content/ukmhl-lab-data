132 Was the destruction of these papers perpetrated before Sir Everard Home had completed his own vo- lumes on comparative anatomy, and finished his numer- ous contributions to the Royal Society? Were any of the destroyed papers on the subjects, which Sir Everard has treated of ? Does Mr. Hunter’s will contain any directions for an act of destruction, so injurious to the cause of physio- logical and surgical science, which he ever shewed the greatest anxiety to promote; and calculated to lessen so considerably the value of the collection, the arrangement and completion of which seem to have been latterly the great objects of his life? Had he communicated any such wish to his nephew and executor, Dr. Baillie, or to any other person ? Did Sir Everard Home ever mention to his co-executor, or to any other person, his promise to destroy these manuscripts ? If he felt the obligation so imperative, as to supersede all the public considerations which so powerfully forbade the act, why did lie delay it from the time of Mr. Hunter’s death (1793) to the year 1823? a delay which, from the uncertainty of health and other contingencies, might very probably have frustrated the performance of the promise. Did SirE. Home, before doing the deed, consult with his co-executor, Dr. Baillie ? Did he do it before or after the lamented death of that amiable, upright, and honour- able character? If before, how long before ? If after, how soon after? The exact date of the conflagration is important in many points of view; no doubt it can be furnished, since it is understood that the quantity of papers destroyed was so great, that the escape of burning fragments from the chimney caused an alarm of fire, in consequence of which the dwelling of Sir Everard was actually entered by the firemen.

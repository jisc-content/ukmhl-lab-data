That the regulations, first promulgated and acted upon in 1823, prescribing the course of study required of candidates for the diploma, contain provi- sions of the most oppressive character, injurious to the rights and property of individuals, calculated to increase the expenses and difficulties of acquiring surgical know- ledge, and to serve the private interests of the examiners, by whom they were made. In proof of this statement the three following regulations may be adduced : 1st. fi Candidates for the diploma will be required to produce, prior to examination, certificates of having re- gularly attended three winter courses at least of ana- tomical lectures, and also one or more winter courses of chirurgical lectures, and of having performed dissections during two or more winter courses/’ Thus certificates of attendance on summer courses of anatomical and sur- gical lectures and dissections are no longer received, although such certificates had always heretofore been admitted indiscriminately with those of winter courses; and lecturers inferior to none in established reputation for ability, knowledge, and usefulness, had been in the habit of teaching anatomy during the summer to large classes of pupils; and although such opportunities of employing in anatomical pursuits the five months of com- parative leisure and longer day-light, from May to Oc- tober, must be advantageous to all zealous students, and Moved by W.

33 study pursued by the pupils, not only shew that there is not the smallest excuse for the course adopted by the College, but place in a strong light the injustice of such an exclusion to the surgeons of these hospitals, implying, as it obviously does, that they are unable to impart in- struction ; its injustice to country students, whom it dis- courages from employing valuable means of information ; and the injury it is consequently calculated to inflict on the profession and on the public. The Court of Ex. aminers have imparted to us, in these regulations, their notion of what renders an hospital worthy of confidence as a source of surgical information ; it must â€œ contain on an average one hundred patientswhether medical or surgical, or, if mixed, in what proportions, they have omitted to particularize. The hospitals of Leeds, Man- chester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, contain between one and two hundred patients; and I believe that very few, if any, of our county hospitals, fall short of the number required by the College rule. These es- tablishments receive accidents, cases for operation, and surgical diseases of all kinds, and thiis present ample opportunities of studying all parts of surgery. In these great fields of experience, some of the distinguished ornaments of our profession have gained that practical knowledge, which has laid the foundation of their fame, and has enabled them to enlarge the boundaries of our science. In many instances anatomical instructions are given to the students, and these, in some cases, are gratuitous; clearly proving,that the surgeons are neither incapable of affording instruction, nor less disinterestedly zealous than their London brethren, in furthering the education of their pupils. The ordinary term of study is three, four, or five years; generally the latter; and the pupils are all dressers. Without wishing to disparage D

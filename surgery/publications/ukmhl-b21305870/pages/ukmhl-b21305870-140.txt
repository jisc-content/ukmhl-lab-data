during the last twenty-six years, (1). For this modest assumption, no other proof is offered, than their own assertion. They advert, however, to the “ more extended education,” which they have progressively required of candidates for the diploma; which “ mainly” contri- buted to the advancement of surgery. It will be seen, by reference to the table, (Appendix, No. 18), that the course of study required by the College, and the exami- nations instituted by them, are much more confined than in any of the various instances comprised in that compa- rative view; they appear very defective, even in com- parison with the necessary qualifications for the lowest rank in the military and naval medical service, and with those required of persons intending to practise as apo- thecaries. (See the Comparative View ; p. 89.) What can have been that original education, in comparison with which the council describe the present narrow and defective system as “ more extended,” speaking of it as an improvement attained by the several steps of a slow progression? Lastly, “ the council believe that not any persons, except the Court of Examiners [that is, themselves under another name] are able to judge cor- rectly “ respecting the fitness or unfitness of those who undertake to teach anatomy and surgery,” (5).

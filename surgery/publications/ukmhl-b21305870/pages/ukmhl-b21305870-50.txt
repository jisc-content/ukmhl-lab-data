The medical clinic in the general hospital at Vienna, consisted of two wards, each containing twelve beds;* and that of the illustrious J. P. Frank at Pavia did not contain more than twenty. The surgical clinic at Vienna consists of fourteen beds, eight for males, and six for females ; f and that for dis- eases of the eye, of twenty-four. } Thus, Gentlemen, the great men, whom I have cited—and the annals of our profession contain no names more deservedly venerated than those of Richter, Scarpa, Von Hildenbrand, Frank, and Beer—instead of estimating1 the advantage of the student in a direct ratio to the number of patients sub- mitted to his observation, have considered it most con- ducive to his instruction to limit his attention to a few cases, making each of these a study, carefully investi- gating the history, symptoms, and causes, shewing the nature and seat of the affection, and the changes pro- duced in the suffering organs, pointing out the dis- tinctions and the probable course and termination of the * “ There can be nothing,” says the very intelligent observer, to whom we are indebted for a description of the Vienna medical school, “ we think, more certain, than that to be really useful, a clinic must consist of a small number of patients. In a clinic, the patients are not to be merely seen, but to be observed; not to be observed by a man of experience merely, but their symptoms and treatment to be made the subjects of investigation by those, who are yet unaccustomed to the practice of medicine. The clinical visit ought not to surpass the space of an hour. Now, in that space of time, it is impossible to visit more than twenty-four patients. Frank had rarely above eighteen in his clinic at Pavia.”-— Quarterly Journal of Foreign Medicine and Surgery, vol. i. p. 48. t Ibid. p. 171. t Ibid. p. 176.

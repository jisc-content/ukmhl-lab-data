20 abilities and the knowledge acquired by long study and practice, in teaching anatomy.* Another recent case will shew you that the ambiguity of this unintelligible process may be found very oppres- sive. Mr. Kiernan is a gentleman, who has devoted him- self for some years, with great zeal and success, to the study of anatomy and surgery, both in this country and in the most celebrated schools of France and Italy, with the express purpose of becoming a teacher, for which employment he has shewn himself admirably qualified. He was informed at the Coliege, that his certificates would not be received. He procured a strong testi- monial of his qualifications, grounded on personal know- ledge, from three of the surgeons of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, where he had studied for a long time. Of the other three surgeons, two refused to sign this document, because his intended establishment in the neighbourhood of the hospital would be disadvantageous to their interests as teachers; and the third was not sufficiently acquainted with Mr. K. to concur in a representation resting on per- sonal knowledge. A second application, thus supported, met with the same peremptory refusal as the first. In order to appreciate this decision, let us compare the chances of information from an hospital surgeon with those which can be afforded by a person, who, like Mr. Kiernan, exclusively devotes himself to teaching ana- tomy. This occupation is not so simple and easy as some persons may suppose: it requires, at least, much time and patience, especially if the students, whose instruc- tion is undertaken, and whose money is received with that understanding, are numerous. Hence it appears * Mr. Bennett’s statement of his own case will be found in file Appendix, No. III.

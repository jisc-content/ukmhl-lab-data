41 ha^e befitted the character of a scientific body, in con- formity with the spirit of the age, they have busied them- selves in framing new restraints for a liberal profession just when the present enlightened government are daily evincing their anxiety to give the freest scope to the talent, industry, and enterprise of the country;—at a period when every effort is made to remove the trammels that have so long impeded the progress of internal trade and foreign commerce, and to set free manufactures, the mechanic arts, and even handicraft. Inquiring into the mode of examination pursued by the College, we naturally come to the important subject of education; respecting which I shall only observe, that on its right direction depends, not only the advancement of surgical science, but the utility of the profession, and the respectability of its members. In laying down the course of study which is required of those who present themselves for examination, the Court of Examiners have given us their notion of surgical education. A document emanating from such an authority, and designed as a guide to the profession, claims our close attention. I shall take the liberty of reading to you the College re- gulations on this subject, and then of making a few remarks on them. “ Candidates for the diploma will be required to pro- duce, prior to examination, certificates— “ 1st. Of having been engaged six years, at least, in the acquisition of professional knowledge : “ 2ndl}\ Of being twenty-two years of age;—And, according to the above resolutions (referring to some previous resolutions); “ 3rdly. Of having regularly attended three winter courses, at least, of anatomical lectures; and also, one or more winter courses of chirurgical lectures.

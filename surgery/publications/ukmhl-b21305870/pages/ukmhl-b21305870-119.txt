107 1. Practical Surgery, by Professor Kern. 2. Practical Ophthalmology, by Professor Beer. 3. General Patho- logy, Therapeutics, and Materia Medica, by Professor Herrmann. 4. Special Therapeutics of Internal Diseases, by Professor Raimann. Such are the ordinary lectures on medicine in the University of Vienna. Those indeed of Professors Von Hildenbrand, Kern, Beer, and Raimann, are delivered in the General Hospital. For none of the above lectures is any fee paid by those who are enrolled as students in the University. The expense of enrollment is fifteen paper- guldens half-yearly, which at the present depreciated state of the Austrian paper-money, is about nine shil- lings. For the lectures and clinic of Professor Beer, strangers pay twenty-five paper-guldens yearly. The lectures of Professors Herrmann and Raimann are de- signed for candidates in surgery, and are seldom attended by students of medicine. The following are accounted extraordinary lectures: I. Diseases of Women and Children, by Professor Boer. 2. Philosophical and Physical Knowledge neces- sary for Surgeons, by Professor Pissling. 3. Duties of those who attend the Sick, by Professor Schmidt, For these lectures a small fee is paid. Those of Pro- fessor Schmidt are delivered on the Sunday evenings. The lectures of Professor Prochaska on Physiology, and of Professors Hartmann and Von Hildenbrand, are given in Latin : the others in German. The students of practical anatomy carry on their dis- sections in the University. To foreigners, subjects are supplied at the price of seven paper-guldens. They are brought from the General Hospital, but are not so plenti- ful as in the dissecting rooms of Paris. All dissection in the General Hospital is at present strictly forbidden ;

But that which begins in October, is called by the lecturers themselves, according to their advertisements in the newspapers, the “ autum- nal course,” and that which commences in January, is uniformly denominated the “ spring course.” You see, therefore, that the candidate cannot comply with the law ; there is no winter course of lectures for him to attend. If it should be answered, that the meaning of the Court will be understood by students and by the profession, in spite of their own document, I shall readily admit it, observing only that they, who presume to regu- late professional education, ought at least to be able to express their own meaning clearly in a composition of a few lines. This regulation, however, requires a closer examination; it will be worth while to investigate its nature and objects a little more narrowly. As the winter is most favourable for dissection, it has been customary to employ that season for teaching, not only anatomy, but also the various other branches of medical education. You must know that the subjects, to which the student is obliged to attend, are so numerous, that he cannot ad- vantageously embrace the whole at one time; his mind would be distracted with their multiplicity and rapid succession.

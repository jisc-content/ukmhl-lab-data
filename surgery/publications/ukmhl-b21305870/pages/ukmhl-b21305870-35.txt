23 important to surgeons, because no operations are per- formed on them, because medical practitioners can dis- pense with an intimate knowledge of them, we cannot be surprised if the mutilated remains of the science should excite only a feeble interest, and all enthusiastic feeling should be extinguished both in teacher and learner. Hence the disgraceful contrast between our own country and the continent, in the recent and present state of ana- tomy. While the science has been extended, and its literature enriched abroad by the Mascagnis, the Cal- danis, and the Scarpas, by the Soemmerrings, Walthers, Prochaskas, Reils, Tiedemanns, and Meckels, by the Bichats, B6clards, and Cloquets, we can hardly mention a single Englishman whose name is known as an ana- tomist beyond the shores of the island : we have not only no new contributions to the science, but not even a single original standard work worthy of the present state of knowledge; so that for any thing beyond guides to the dissecting room, English students must resort to the anatomical literature of France, Germany, and Italy. If the monopoly of anatomical teaching, which the College are now attempting to establish, in favour of the hospital surgeons, should be enforced and rendered permanent, it will be calculated to perpetuate this disgraceful state of things, and, if possible, to sink the science in this country to a still lower state. Gentlemen, you will not have failed to observe that the rule, which requires attendance on an hospital in London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow, or Aberdeen, tacitly excludes the certificates of all the provincial hospitals in England, and of all similar establishments in all other parts of the world. This proscription conveys a most injurious reflection on the surgeons of our county hospitals: having the pleasure of being acquainted with

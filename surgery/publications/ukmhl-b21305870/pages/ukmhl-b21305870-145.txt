131 square? Was not Mr. Clift well acquainted with their existence and contents? If the “constituted authori- ties” of the College knew nothing about them, m iglit they not have known, if they had inquired? and must they not necessarily have known, if they had undertaken the formation of a descriptive catalogue, as soon as they became possessed of this invaluable scientific treasure, or even immediately after it had been arranged in its present situation? If we should entertain the same doubt, which the council have so clearly expressed, re- specting the promise alleged to have been made to Mr. Hunter, various points immediately suggest themselves, as matters of inquiry; and the questions are such, as that body can have no difficulty in answering. What was the nature, amount, and state of these manuscripts? The mechanical labour of writing out so many volumes was a great sacrifice of time; and this must have been severely felt by one, whose avocations were so numerous and important, as those of Mr. Hunter. To take this trouble, to preserve the papers thus written, to collect and bind them up into volumes, affords no indication of a wish that they should be destroyed. The very nature of the subject precludes the possibility of the ordinary mo- tives for such an injunction; and the desire which Mr. Hunter constantly manifested, to communicate freely to the public all the results of his labours, raises the strong- est presumption against his having devoted to destruc- tion these valuable papers. As Mr. Hunter’s death was sudden, the promise must have been exacted at some pre- vious period, and not under the prospect of dying; so that we are presented with the irreconcilable contradic- tion of the greatest care being taken to preserve papers, and directions given for their destruction by the same in- dividual, at one and the same time. k 2

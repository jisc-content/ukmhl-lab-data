8 desired explanation. We find that the soundness or unsoundness of knowledge depends on the season of the year in which it is acquired, and on a certain accidental circumstance in the situation of the individuals who im- part it. Sound anatomical and surgical knowledge is that gained in the winter season, and derived from the surgeons or physicians of London hospitals, or from per- sons teaching in a school recognized by the medical es- tablishment of certain hospitals, or from the appointed professors of anatomy and surgery in the Universities of Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen.

So much for the object they wish to attain, the “ promotion of sound chirurgical knowledgewe then come to the evil they propose to avoid, viz. “ practices which have a contrary tendency.” Practices which have a tendency contrary to sound knowledge! What can be the meaning of this phrase? Common persons would have supposed it unfavourable to knowledge to restrict the study of anatomy and surgery either in time or place, especially in a country like England, where the neces- sary means of the former pursuit sometimes cannot be procured at all, and are never attainable without difficulty and great expence -but the authors of the regulation are of a decidedly contrary opinion. In short, Gentle- men, we can collect nothing from this preamble, except the alternative, either that a complete confusion of ideas must have prevailed in the heads from which it emanated, or that the objectionable nature of the contemplated measures was so strongly felt by their authors, as to suggest the necessity of covering them by a decent pre- text; and this miserable attempt at giving reasons was thought better than nothing.

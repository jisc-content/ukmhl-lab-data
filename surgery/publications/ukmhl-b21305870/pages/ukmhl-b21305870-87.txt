75 to the operation of the bye-law, as that of two-thirds of the teachers now recognized in London, who do not conform to its provisions. They are acknowledged in consequence of having been teachers prior to its pro- mulgation. I have also a similar claim, having begun teaching in 1822. It is further said, that their certificates having been admitted by the Court before the bye-law was passed, gave them an indisputable right to the con- tinuance of that privilege. 1 take the liberty of stating two exceptions, in the cases of Mr. G—— and Mr. S . The first of those gentlemen gave certificates* it is true, but it was merely by procuration from bis brother, during the illness of the latter. Had he given them in his own name, the objection which the Court certainly at first made to admitting them, after the passing of the bye-law, would have been wholly inapplicable. Mr. S — commenced teaching but four months prior to the promulgation of the bye-law, and therefore could not have given any certificates. Still both those gentlemen are now recognized by the Court. The ex- ception in their favour is fully warranted by their abilities and attainments; but it is an exception which, I submit, I am fullv entitled to share. •/ Such are the claims I have to urge upon your atten- tion; and the only objection that can be offered, viz. that of my not being a member of your college during the two first years I lectured in Paris, is rendered perfectly nu- gatory by the fact, that the Court of Examiners admitted the certificates of private teachers, members of the Irish College, equally with those of the English, before the existence of the present bye-law. I have now to state, that the College having last year interfered to prevent Mr. Canning from procuring me, and the English students in Paris, an establishment there.

li tomical season, would proceed just on the opposite prin- ciple. The comfort and convenience of students, as well as their progress in knowledge, would be much more effectually consulted by diffusing over the whole year the opportunities of receiving instruction, and re- cognizing the fitness of the summer for that purpose. What reason can be assigned for giving lectures in the winter, rather than in the summer? Although the former season is better suited than the latter for dissection, it is often necessary, and still oftener convenient to students, to employ in anatomical pursuits some portion of the greater comparative leisure and longer day-light which are afforded in the five months between April and October. Sometimes a sufficient supply of subjects cannot be procured during the winter season ; or the student may be disabled by illness. Hence summer courses of anatomical instruction have been opened in London of late years ; and the opportunities thus afforded have been eagerly embraced by large numbers of stu- dents, especially by many whose time and pecuniary means have been limited. The great obstacle to ana- tomical pursuits, from the difficulty of procuring sub- jects, and the heavy expences to which students of surgery are unavoidably exposed, must be increased by this strange novelty of requiring that every thing should be done in the winter, and this obvious attempt to de- stroy the very existence of summer anatomical classes. Finding in the nature of the subject no justification of such an attempt, but every reason for an opposite course of proceeding, we are at a loss to account for the deter- mination of the Examiners. Some will find a sufficient, if not satisfactory, ground of their conduct, in the cir- cumstance, that they are nearly all interested, either personally or by their relations and near connexions, in

122 opened to the profession, and why it cannot be for some time, admitting the completion of that catalogue to be of such paramount importance as the Council deem it to be. It may be further observed, that the study of com- parative anatomy had been formerly so little prosecuted in this country, that, though many persons were con- sulted, none could aid in giving a description of the in- dividual preparations in the Hunterian Collection. The Conservator has, however, for a considerable time been engaged in such researches and inquiries, as have enabled him, not only to give an exact account of each prepara- tion, but also to explain Mr. Hunter’s intentions in the formation of his collection ; and the more the time of the Conservator shall be occupied in explaining the contents of the Museum to visitors, the longer, necessarily, must the completion of the catalogue be retarded. With respect to the library, it’s formation has been the act of the College, and is intended to aid the profes- sional inquiries of it’s members, for which purpose it will, when in a proper state, be opened. It may be added, that of the numerous applications made by members, for permission to refer to publications therein, every one has been most readily complied with; and the same may be observed of applications to examine and to make drawings from preparations in the Museum. With regard to the supposed indignity offered to the members at large, by their being admitted to the theatre by a door at the back of the building; the Council,-— aware that any want of respect to it’s members would be a failure of respect to the institution itself,—did not ima- gine that umbrage would be taken by such an arrange- ment; at the same time, they regret that the present con- struction of the building precludes the practicability of an alteration.

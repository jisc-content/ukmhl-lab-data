In re- quiring three courses of lectures, and two of dissections, the College are not only contributing to the maintenance of a pernicious mistake, but quite inverting the natural order in point of importance. One course of surgical lectures, and twelve months’ attendance on the practice of an hospital, must be considered a very moderate allow- ance; even although the lectures should possess the im- portant quality of being delivered in winter, and the hospital should have the advantage of being situated in one of the “ recognized schools.” Thus, Gentlemen, anatomy and surgery compose the short catalogue of col- lege studies; certificates of having spent sixteen months in attending anatomical and surgical lectures, performing dissections, and attending an hospital, are the easy con- ditions of admission to an examination. If the qualifica- tions of the candidate be confined to the slender stock of knowledge which such a course of study can bestow, the Court would act very unfairly in subjecting him to a severe examination. But a much longer time, and ampler range of studies, are necessary to give to surgeons that kind and amount of knowledge, which the state of sci- ence, the interests of the community, and the respect- ability of the profession demand. Have you ever heard, Gentlemen, of physiology? It is not mentioned in the College list of studies; an omission the more remarkable, as having been made in the very precincts of the magni- ficent temple, consecrated by the genius of Hunter, to physiological science. Have you ever heard of patho- logy? of the changes produced by disease in the various structures and organs of our bodies, of the alterations in the living actions,of the causes that produce such changes, of the agents and circumstances capable of arresting them

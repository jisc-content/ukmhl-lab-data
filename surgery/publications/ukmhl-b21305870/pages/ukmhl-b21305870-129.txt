115 APPENDIX, No. XIV. Royal College of Surgeons in London. Observations in Refutation of Charges, publicly made by certain Members of the College, against it’s legally constituted Authorities. It is asserted, that the College lias not performed those duties for which it was incorporated. That this assertion is unfounded, will be acknow- ledged by all reflecting and unprejudiced persons who compare the present state of surgery throughout the country, with that, which existed when the College re- ceived its charter, in 1800; for it appears that the in- 1. creased respectability of the profession, may be prin- cipally attributed to the acts and regulations of the College.—This advancement may be mainly ascribed to the more extended education which has been progres- sively required of the candidates for it’s diploma,—to the zeal and talents of it’s professors in displaying and communicating, by public lectures, a scientific know- ledge of the subjects connected with the healing art,— and to the labour and time devoted to the explanation of the contents of it’s museum, by which a strong desire for increase of knowledge has been excited. i 2

78 nuary his apprehensions were realized ; the French stu- dents, instigated by interested individuals, commenced a clamour against the English, on the supposed scarcity of subjects. At length their hostility proceeded so far, that the French authorities interfered ; they compelled the English to surrender the private dissecting rooms they had previously hired at a great expense in the public establishment, and required them to pursue their labours in conjunction with the French students. This was diffi- cult, as they were exposed to great inconveniences; and positive insult finally precluded its possibility. Thus was the English class in Paris, (originaiiy formed by Mr. Bennett, at a sacrifice of much time and great labour) broken up, and thus was he deprived, by the conduct of the council of the College of Surgeons, not only of a considerable income, but of what was of more import- ance to him, the opportunity of pursuing his studies in such a school as Paris. In September 1825, Mr. Bennett, finding all his hopes crushed in Paris, came to London, and addressed the foregoing letter to the Court of Ex- aminers. He confidently anticipated that, as individuals of high rank and great wealth, their honour and honesty would prompt them to make some requital for the cruel injury they had previously inflicted on him. They have, however, rejected his application—their motives for doing so, they have not thought proper to communicate to him. » • i /

94 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS seem that there was a special polypus instrument, consisting of a forceps at one end and a rugine at the other. After describing extraction by means of a knife and scoop he says: ' If, however, any part of the tumour be left behind, we take another polypus eradicator (frepov noKviro^va-T-qv), and with the end of it (ztt&kijlov avrov fvorrjpfoi)) bring away what remains, by stretching, twisting, and scraping it strongly.'

The classical usage is vulsella, -ae, feminine. I shall follow custom and use the modern term when using it as an English word. The myzon, or tumour forceps, was a toothed instrument of the dissecting forceps type. Ducange says it takes its name from the shells which are called ixvtCKol, vulgo fj.vbia (mussels). It was used whenever it was desired to make

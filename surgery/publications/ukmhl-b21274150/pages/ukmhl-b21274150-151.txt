BONE AND TOOTH INSTEUMENTS 135 doubtedly bone levers, it is quite possible, from what Galen says, that they may also have been used for levering out teeth. The smooth end also corresponds to the description of the meningophylax, so that it is possible it may have been used in that capacity also. Bone Forceps. Greek, oardypa. Galen (x. 450) says, in comminuted fracture of the skull we must make a way for the lenticular with the bone forceps (bia rrjs ovraypas); and in depressed fracture Paul (VI. xc) says: f If the bone is strong it is first to be perforated with the drills called abaptista and the fractured bone is to be removed in fragments, with the fingers if possible, if not, with a tooth forceps or a bone forceps' (dbovrdypa rj oardypa). Soranus (lxiv. p. 366) says that in impaction of the foetal cranium the head may be opened with a sharp instrument and the pieces of the skull removed with tooth or bone forceps (dbovrdypas rf oo-rdypas). Aetius copies this (IV. iv. 24) and so does Paul (VI. lxxiv). An excellent specimen of the sequestrum forceps was found in the house of the physician at Pompeii, and is now in the Museum at Naples (No. 78,029). It isformed of two crossed branches moving on a pivot. The handles are square, the jaws are curved, and have across the inside of them parallel grooves which oppose each other accurately (PI. XLIII). It is classed in the catalogue as an instrument for crushing calculus of the bladder. This is, however, not a manipu- lation which is described by the ancients. The only case in which splitting of calculi is referred to is in Celsus, and then a chisel is used. Varix Extractor. An instrument, apparently a forceps, for extracting varicose veins in segments is mentioned by Galen:

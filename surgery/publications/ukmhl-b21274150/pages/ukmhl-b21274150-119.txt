BLEEDING CUPS 103 useful about the head, where bronze ones would be difficult to remove, and also in the case of nervous persons who dread the flame. Bronze and glass cups may be used without flame like horn ones if a hole is bored in the summit and the air sucked out, and the finger or a piece of wax is applied immediately (Oribasius, Collect VII. xvi). Aristotle in his Poetics discusses various tricks and arts of authors and among these he mentions the riddle of which he gives as an example: avhp elbov nvpl xa^Kov in avepi KoKkijaavra ' I saw a man who had glued on a man bronze by means of fire ' the reference being to a bronze cupping- vessel (see also Mayor's note to Juvenal xiv. 58). The cups mentioned by Hippocrates are also of bronze. The earliest written references are thus to bronze cups worked by fire. Ethnological research would indicate, however, that horns worked by suction represent the more primitive form. A good number of cups have come down to us. There are fourteen in the Naples Museum. There are two prevalent or usual types, one conical, and the other flatter and more rounded. The largest cup known is in the Athens Museum. Attached to it had been a chain 20 cm. long to hang it up by. It is 16 cm. in height, and was found in a tomb at Tanagra. This cup with its chain and attachment is shown in PL XXXIII. In the British Museum there is one of bronze, 4 inches high and of the elongated conical shape. It was found in Corfu (PL XXXIV). One in Naples of similar shape has a ring attached to its summit as the Athens specimen had (PL XXXV). There are four very small cups in the museum at Mainz. These are 2-5 to 3 cm. in height and 3 to 3-5 cm. in diameter. Two of these are shown in PL XXXVI, figs. 1, 3. There are ten cups of glass in the Athens museum. They are of the general shape of the Mainz cups, but vary in height from 4 cm. to 6-8 cm. and in the Scottish National Museum of Antiquities there are two cupping-horns which correspond

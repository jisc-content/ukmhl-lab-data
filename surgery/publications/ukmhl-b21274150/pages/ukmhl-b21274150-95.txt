79 PEOBES is seen in PL XIX, fig. 1. This specimen is in the Naples Museum, and was found along with the spatula shown in PL XIX, fig. 2. The handles of each are of bronze, the scoop and spatula parts are of silver. Vulpes describes these as a lancet for drawing blood and a spoon for collecting and examining the same. It is impossible to regard an instru- ment of silver as a cutting instrument. These are for mixing and spreading medicaments. A large spoon of a peculiar shape from the Naples Museum is seen in PL XIX, fig. 3. It is of silver. The handle, which is of ivory, is ornamented with spiral carving, and the end bears a ram's head. Another interesting little shovel from the same museum is of bronze, and carries the head of Minerva Medica on the end of the handle (PL XX, fig. 5). We may here include the large double spatulae of the type shown in PL XX, fig. 1, which represents a specimen from Naples. A similar one was found in the outfit of the Paris surgeon, and Scultetus shows precisely similar instruments in use in his time for applying the stiffening to the bandages, &c. for setting fractures. The Eomans probably used theirs for a similar purpose. Tongue Depressor. Greek, yXodo-o-oKaToyps. To open a quinsy Aetius says (II, iv. 45) : ' If the patient is adult, seat him and make him open his mouth, and depress the tongue with a spathomele, or a tongue depressor, and open the abscess with a probe or a needle knife.' In excision of the tonsil Paul (VI. xxx) bids us seat the patient in the sun and depress the tongue with a tongue depressor (ykiiicraoKaToyu). PL XX, fig. 6 shows one of six bronze tongue depressors, burnished like small mirrors, from the Lepine collection (Vedrenes, Celse). Uterine Sound. The uterine sound is frequently mentioned by Hippocrates

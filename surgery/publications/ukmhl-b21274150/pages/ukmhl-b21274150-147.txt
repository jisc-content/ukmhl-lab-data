BONE AND TOOTH INSTEUMENTS 131 Galen (xviii. 331) mentions these 1 knife-shaped' saws: ' For in this way each does not become so exactly smooth as with sword-shaped saws (naxaipooT&v npiovoiv)' There is an example of this form of saw in the Guildhall Museum, London. Trephine. Greek, rpvTiavov, Trpuaiv, TTpicov \apaKTos, x0LVLK^i opdonpionv; Latin, modiolus. The ancient trephine is referred to by Hippocrates, who mentions a saw {-npi(av and irpiaav yapaKros) having a circular motion (iii. 374): ' In trephining you must frequently remove the trephine, on account of the heat in the bone, and plunge it in cold water. For the trephine (-npiu>v), being heated by the circular motion (irepiobov) and heating and drying the bone, burns it and makes a larger piece of bone exfoliate than would otherwise be necessary.' And again: ' You must saw the bone down to the meninges with a serrated trephine (irpCovL xpv xaPaKT§ eju/nyuW), and in doing so must take out the trephine (irplova), and examine with a probe and by other means along the track of the trephine ' (7repi£ Kara rr\v ohbv rov upCovos). In injuries to the head in young people (iii. 371) he mentions a small trephine (crpuKpbv rpvnavov), so that apparently several sizes were available. Hippocrates, we have seen, uses the words npmv and -npLuv xaPaKTo$ to denote I the trephine. Galen always uses but in his Lexicon | he gives two other words, viz. opOo-npiovi and irep-qr-qpL^, ostensibly from the works of Hippocrates: ^OpOoTTpiOVl Tjj XOLVLKibi, TT€pr]Tr)pL(i>—Tpvndvid tw tvdei kch 6^€t, eon yap /cat erepov f) XOLVLKLS. These terms do not, however, occur in any extant Hippo- cratic writings, unless, as seems possible to me, the latter term Tr€pr]Trjp[(a be a var. led. for the obscure word rpvykr)-

CHAPTER VII CAUTERIES Cautery, Greek, Kavr-qpiov, KavTrjp, Kavr-qpCSiov crihripeov; Latin, Ferrum candens. The cautery was employed to an almost incredible extent in ancient times, and surgeons expended much ingenuity in devising different forms of this instrument. A consider- able number of these shapes are definitely mentioned. The cautery is nearly always spoken of as made of iron. Bronze becomes too soft to act well as a cautery, so that even the earliest references to the cautery in the authentic Hippo- cratic writings refer to cauteries as ' the irons ' (a-tbripia). It is true, of course, that in special cases bronze was used—and Priscianus recommends a cautery of gold or silver for stop- ping haemorrhage from the throat (Logicus, xxii)—but iron was the usual thing, and in spite of the enormous numbers of cauteries which must have existed only a very few have come down to us, as the iron has perished. The cautery was employed for almost every possible purpose, as a ' counter- irritant ', as a haemostatic, as a bloodless knife, as a means of destroying tumours, &c. The following passage is interesting as showing its appli- cation in two of these capacities (Aet. IV. iv. 45): ' I put the patient lying on her back, then I incise the sound part of the breast outside the cancer and burn the incision with cauteries until the eschar produced stops the flow of blood. By and by I incise again and dissect the depth of the breast and again burn the incision; and often repeat the same, both cutting and cauterizing to stop the haemorrhage, for then the danger of a rush of bleeding is avoided, and after the amputation is completed I again burn all the parts to desiccation. The first cauterization is for the sake of stopping the haemorrhage, the second for eradi- cating all traces of the disease/

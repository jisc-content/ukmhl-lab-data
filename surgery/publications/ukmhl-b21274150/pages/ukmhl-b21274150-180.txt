164 GRAECO-KOMAN SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS Band of Antyllus. In the interesting dissertation which Oribasius gives on the subject of phlebotomy (Med. Collect vii) he states that Antyllus directs us to apply a ligature of two fingers' breadth round the arm when going to let blood at the elbow. He says that they are mistaken who affirm that the same effect may be produced by applying the band below, for the veins will not then swell even if the arm be fomented. When going to bleed at the ankle the ligature is to be applied at the knee. When the blood does not flow well he advises us to slacken the bandage if too tight. This is the famous 'band of Antyllus '. It is mentioned also in the pseudo-Hippocratic treatise on Ulcers (iii. 328): ' When you have opened the vein and after you have let blood and have loosened the fillet (jaiviav) and yet the blood does not stop.' Paul also mentions the band, including one round the neck when the veins of the forehead are to be opened for ophthalmia. So far as we know the fillet was nothing more than a plain strip of linen or some such material, but DenefFe, commenting on two bronze fibulae which were found in the grave of the surgeon of Paris, conjectures that they may have been used to fix the fillet in venesection. I give figures of these after DenefFe, but it seems to me that these buckles are more likely to have belonged to the straps of a portable instrument-case of canvas or leather which had disappeared. One is a neat little heptagonal fibula, 2-8 cm. in its widest part, with a tongue 27 mm. long (PI. LII, fig. 2). The other fibula is in the form of a penannular ring, formed by a two-headed serpent curved on itself so that the two heads look at each other, separated from each other by a space of a few millimetres (PL LII, fig. 8). Opposite the heads there is a small rectangular opening to receive the end of the strap. There is no tongue.

26 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS which, to extract the stone. An example of this is seen in the box of scalpels from Athens (PL IV). The Blade. For the study of the different varieties of blade we have at our disposal first of all the specimens that have actually survived. Of these the largest number are to be seen in the Naples Museum, but a considerable number are to be found scattered over various museums. An ex voto tablet found on the site of the temple of Aesculapius on the Acropolis at Athens shows a box of scalpels, among which are some interesting forms (PI. IV). The scalpels, it will be noted, are arranged head and tail alternately. A few varieties are actually described in detail in the classical authors, and, by piecing together other references to parti- cular instruments and drawing inferences from the various uses to which we find them put, we are able to describe a surprisingly large number of forms. The sixteenth-century writers, such as Pare, and seventeenth-century writers, such as Scultetus, illustrate with great confidence many of the cutting instruments mentioned by ancient writers, but it is easy to show that in several instances they are wrong, and, therefore, I have drawn on them as little as possible. As a basis of classification we may select the following points about the blade. The form may be straight or curved. There may be only one cutting edge or there may be two, and the point may be sharp or blunt. We shall examine combinations of these in the following order : I. Blade straight— (A) Cutting on one side only (a) sharp-pointed, (b) blunt-pointed. (B) Cutting on two edges (a) sharp-pointed, (b) blunt- pointed. II. Blade curved— (A) Cutting on one edge (a) sharp-pointed, (b) blunt- pointed. (B) Cutting on two edges, sharp-pointed.

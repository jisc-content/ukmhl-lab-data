85 PEOBES however, a few dissecting maimbrioli as separate instru- ments not designed to carry scalpel blades. Three were found together in the grave of the surgeon of Paris. There are also two in the museum of St-Germain-en-Laye, and one in the Museum at Mainz. We may take as types two from the find of the oculist Severus in the St-Germain-en- Laye Museum (PI. XX, figs. 3,4). They consist of elongated leaf-shaped blades carried on hexagonal handles, and are exactly similar in appearance to a scalpel handle, except that they do not carry a slot for the insertion of a blade. Curved Dissectors. Greek, vhpoKrjXLKov Koirapiov. On the cure of hydrocele Paul (VI. lxii) says : * "When the fluid is in the tunica vaginalis we make the incision where the apex of the tunica makes its appearance, and, separating the lips of the incision with a hook, and having dissected off the fascia with the hydrocele specillum and the scalpel (l^viAevCcravres rw re vhpoKY)kiK(p KoirapicD not t<5 o-jatAto)), we divide it through the middle with a lancet' Treating of the excision of varices (VI. lxxxii) he says : ' Having separated the lips of the wound with hooks, and dissected away the fascia with curved hydrocele specilla, and laid bare the vein and freed it all round' (vbpoKrjkLKois €TTtKa/X7T€(rt KoirapCoLs). A curved dissector from the find of the oculist Severus, now in the Museum of St-Germain-en-Laye, has a neatly ornamented handle with a small hook at one end, and at the other it curves first backward and then forward to join a small leaf-shaped dissector 3 cm. long and 1 cm. in its greatest breadth (PI. XXIII, fig. 2). Sharp HooTcs. Greek, ayKurrpov, ayKvpojxrjXr}; Latin, hamusy hamulus acutus. Hooks blunt and sharp are frequently mentioned in both

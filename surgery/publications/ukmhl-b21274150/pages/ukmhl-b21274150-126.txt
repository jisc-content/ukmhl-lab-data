110 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS and the space which is in the tube being emptied something else is of necessity drawn in, and since there is no other space than the mouth of the tube the liquid at and near it must of necessity be drawn into it. 'Again when we wish to inject some liquid we put it into the tube AB and taking hold of EF and pressing in the tube CD we press out as much as we think necessary.' Note that Hero's description does not tally with the drawings which accompany the edition of his works which we possess (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 3, 4, 5). These show an instrument with a piston formed by a plug at the end of a rod, whereas Hero says the piston is to be formed of a second tube fitting inside the first. This is interesting, be- cause it is much easier to get a well-fitting piston in this way than in the other ; and this principle has been reverted to in many of our best hypodermic syringes and in some of the best air pumps, such as Edwards's. Ear Syringe. Greek, uTeyxyT-qs, (Ltlkos kKvctt^p ; Latin, oricularius clyster. The ear syringe is very frequently referred to by both Greek and Latin writers; in fact, Celsus uses the term so often to denote a syringe for a large variety of uses that it is evident that it is almost a general term for any small syringe. In addition to its use in washing out the ear in cases of foreign bodies, impacted cerumen, &c. he uses it to wash out the foreskin in balanitis, to syringe fistulae, to wash out the bladder through a lithotomy wound, &c. In cases of foreign bodies in the ear he says : Sternutamenta quoque admota id commode elidunt, aut oriculario clystere aqua vehementer intus compulsa (VI. vii). Aetius and Paul tell us it was used to wash out the vagina, and Paul says it might be used to make injections into the bladder. Oribasius says : ' We use flushing with an ear syringe in abscess of the

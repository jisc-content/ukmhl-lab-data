82 GBAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTRUMENTS is to have fumigations for five or six days till the cervix is softened. After these fumigations, dilators (irpoo-Oeroiv) made of pieces of very smooth slipping pinewood are to be introduced into the cervix. There were six of these. Each was six finger breadths (4-2 in.) in length. They ended in a point, and each succeeding rod was larger than the preceding one; the largest being of the diameter and shape of the index finger, being smaller at one extremity than the other. They should be as round as possible and with no splinters. Before being introduced they were smeared with oil. First the point was gradually intro- duced by rotating the dilator and pushing it simultaneously till it entered for a distance of four finger breadths (2-8 in.). After the first rod was introduced it was withdrawn and replaced by a larger one. During the after treatment a leaden tube filled with mutton fat was left in the uterus at night, while through the day one of the pine dilators was used. PL XX, fig. 2 shows a specimen from Pompeii, which Vedrenes regards as a uterine dilator. It is hollow, and is ornamented to resemble the head and body of a snake. Metal Dilators mounted on handles of wood. Hippocrates (i. 473) mentions a variety of dilator made of tin or lead, and hollow behind for mounting on a wooden handle: 1 After douching and fumigation, dilate, and, if necessary, straighten the cervix with a dilator of tin or lead (rfj /xrjAr] rf? Kao-o-LTepLvri 7] fj.oXv(Bhaivr]), beginning with a fine one, and then a thicker if it be admitted, until it seems to be in proper position. Dip the dilators in some emollient. The dilators are to be made hollow behind, and fitted round rather long pieces of wood and thus used.' This evidently refers to a portable set of dilators, each capable of fitting on a common handle, like Fritsch's, Peaslee's, or Lawson Tait's of modern times.

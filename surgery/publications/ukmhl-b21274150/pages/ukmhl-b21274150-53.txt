37 KNIVES In Soranns (Bib. II. xviii. par. 59, p. 359, ed. Bose) there occurs mention of an instrument for puncturing the membranes where they do not rupture spontaneously : Xopiov be jJiT] ava<TTOfioviJLâ‚¬vop KCLTiabi Ttpoo-eyovT&s bicupeLV ri baKTvkio irpoKOLkavavTa ri /txepoy. The Latin version of Moschion has: Folliculum verum non ruptum ante digito impresso formantes locum phlebotomo sollicite dividimus omnibus praedictis post encymatismis utimur (xviii. 10, p. 83, ed.

However, we cannot accept this as conclusive evidence that the katias was the same as the phlebotome, as I have already pointed out that this version of Moschion is a late retranslation into Latin of a G-reek translation of the original Moschion. "While the meagre references to the katias point to its having been a similar instrument to the phlebotome, it is by no means certain that the instruments were identical.

Diut. i. 2): ' We abstract blood from the nostrils, and for this purpose push into them a long instrument named Kareidbwv, or the one called the scoop' (Topvvq). In a note to his edition of Celsus, Lee says Aretaeus ' invented an instrument having at the end a blade of grass, or made like a blade of grass, which was thrust into the nostrils to excite an haemorrhage in some affections of the head. This instrument is named KaTtiahiov, from Kara and da a blade of grass \ I have shown, however, that Soranus, who wrote a century before Aretaeus, used the term, and a comparison of the various forms in which the word appears seems to me to point rather to a connexion with KaOCrj^t, one meaning of which is ' to let blood \ The next writer who mentions it is Aetius (II. iii. 2, and again II. iv. 14), where he refers to

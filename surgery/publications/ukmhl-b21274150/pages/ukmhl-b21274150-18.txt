2 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS edition by Erinerins with a Latin rendering (1859-64), and an excellent translation of the genuine works of Hippocrates by the world-famous Dr. Adams of Banchory (Sydenham Soc. Trans., 1849). The best edition, however, is the edition of Kuehlewein, begun in 1894 and at present in course of publication by Teubner, Leipzig. The later volumes have not yet appeared. For the portion of the text which is not contained in the first two volumes of Kuehlewein I have relied on the edition of Kuhn for most of the readings, although occasionally those of Van der Linden or Foes are to be preferred. The references given are to the volumes and pages of Kuhn's edition, but in this edition indications are given of the corresponding localities in the other editions so that cross-references to these can easily be made. There seems to be a different arrangement in different editions of Foes, for Liddell and Scott say the references in their Lexicon are to the pages in Foes but they do not correspond in any way to the pagination of the edition before me (Frankfort, 1595). Aulus Cornelius Celsus is the next writer we have. His system of medicine in eight books is a marvel of lucid arrangement, and his beautiful style makes it a pleasure to read any of his works. The seventh book gives a most interesting review of the surgery of the Alexandrian School. He describes many instruments in detail, although he names fewer special instruments than some of the Greek writers as the Latin language lends itself less well to the formation of compound words than the Greek does. To take one example only, Celsus has practically one word for all varieties of forcepsâ€”vulsella, while the Greeks use many compounds like hair forceps (r/Hxo-Aa/3is), flesh forceps (o-ap/co-A.a/3oj), tooth forceps (dbovrdypa), stump forceps (piC&ypa). Indeed, in the case of the two latter words Celsus falls back on Greek to express himself. Celsus was first published in 1478. Another edition is that of Targa, 1769. The editions before me are those of Daremberg, published at Leipzig in 1859,

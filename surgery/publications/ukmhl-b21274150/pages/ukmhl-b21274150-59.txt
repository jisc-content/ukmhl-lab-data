43 KNIVES the end of the blade, so that it might be rocked upon the stone without chipping as a pointed blade would do. I think the above explanation provides an instrument corre- sponding to a legitimate interpretation of the text and at the same time suited for the operation indicated (PI. VIII, fig. 5).

A special instrument for perforating the foetal cranium is mentioned by Soranus (II. viii. p. 366): Et he fJitCCovos rov KefyakLov vTrapxpvTOs f) o-tyrjvuxns airoreXoLTo, hta TOV efJLfipVOTOfAOV Tj 70V TTokvTTLKOV <TlTa.0LOV KpVTtrOfJiivOV /X€Ta£u Xiyavov kol rov pLCLKpov baKTvXov Kara rrjv h'Oeaiv. c If the head be too big, the obstruction may be removed by the embryotome, or the polypus knife, concealed between the index finger and the thumb during its introduction.' The other authors who recommend this unpleasant opera- tion use mostly the polypus-scalpel or the phlebotome, and hence we may conjecture that a straight two-edged blade was considered the most suitable. The embryotome figured by Albucasis is of this shape (PI. VIII, fig. 7), as is also the cutting part of the perforators of more modern times— fortunately now obsolete. Probe pointed blade with two cutting edges. There is in the Orfila Museum, Paris, a fine little two- edged bistoury of bronze with a probe point (PI. VIII, fig. 2). It is a relic of the Roman occupation of Egypt. Its use must remain a matter of conjecture as we have no written description of such an instrument. It is perhaps a fistula knife. II A.

In extirpating warts Paul (VI. lxxxvii) says we put them on the stretch with a vulsella and extirpate them radically with a scalpel shaped like a crow's beak or a phlebotome

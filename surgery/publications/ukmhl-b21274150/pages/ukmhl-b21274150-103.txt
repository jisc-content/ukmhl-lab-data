PEOBES 87 Similarly Celsus (VII. xxviii) says: At si caro increvit, necessaria est recta linea patefacere; turn ab ora, vel vulsella vel hamo apprehensa, tamquam habenulam excidere. In dissection, many of the manipulations which we perform with the dissecting forceps were performed by the ancients with sharp hooks. PI. XXIV, figs. 1-5 represent specimens from various sources; some simple, others combined with another implement. Blunt HooJcs. Greek, rvfykayKivrpov; Latin, hamus retusus. Aetius (Tet. III. i. 13) says: ' Whatever adhesions there are of the lower border of the lids to the tunics of the eye, we must put them on the stretch with a blunt hook (â„¢$AayKioTpa>) and with a ptery- gotome free the adhesion.' In Aetius (Tet II. iii) we see the blunt hook used in the same way as we use an aneurism needle, except that the ligature is not introduced with it, but with another needle. He says we transfix the lips of the incisions with two hooks and gradually dissecting with the scalpel we free the vessel from the underlying fascia. Then with a blunt hook (Tv<j)\ayKi(TTpov) placed under the vessel we raise it up from the depth, and beneath it when raised we place a two ply thread by means of a needle, and doubly tie and cut between. Paul says: ' Exposing the vessel with dissectors we must raise it up when it is separated all round. If it be small, having stretched and twisted it with a blunt hook, we may divide it through in such a way as to remove part of it. But if it be large we must apply a double ligature under it with a needle, either a piece of raw flax or some other strong thing' (VI. v). The ' eyed hook' is mentioned by Galen in describing the dissection of the spinal cord: 'E^Se^erat 5e kclI x^P^ fithovrjs dyfaorpG) Siarp^ra) yevicrQai

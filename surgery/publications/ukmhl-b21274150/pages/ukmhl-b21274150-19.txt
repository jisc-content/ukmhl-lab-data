3 INTEODUCTOEY and Vedrenes (Paris, 1876). The latter contains illustrations of a considerable number of specimens from Italian and French museums. Eufus of Ephesus (98-117 a. d.) has left little to interest us for our particular purpose, as he merely mentions, without describing, a few instruments, all of which are already known to us from other sources. The best edition is that of Daremberg, Paris, 1879. A Latin translation of his works will be found in Medicae Artis Principes (Stephanus). Aretaeus of Cappadocia has left us a work on Acute and Chronic Diseases. He has few references to instruments, but such as they are they are interesting, as he names some which are given by no other author. He has a tantalizing allusion to a work by himself on surgery which has not been preserved. There is a fine edition of the text, with an English translation by Adams of Banchory, in the Transactions of the Sydenham Society. Galen (130-200 a. d.) was a most voluminous writer, much of whose work remains and teems with matter of interest to us. Much information about instruments is to be gained from even his purely anatomical writings. The most accessible edition is that of Kuhn (20 vols., Leipzig, 1821), but it is slipshod in the text, and even more so in the translation, which is in Latin. Oribasius (325 a. d.) wrote an encyclopaedia of medicine, which is called Svvaycoyal 'Iar/n/catâ€”Collecta Medicinalia, in seventy books, only about one third of which remain. This is the most interesting of his works from our point of view, but he has left also a synopsis of the encyclopaedia called 2vvo\jns, and a sort of first aid manual called EviropLo-ra. I have used the edition of Daremberg and Bussemaker (1851-76). Soranus of Ephesus has left us a most valuable treatise on obstetrics and gynaecology, which, though written only for midwives, contains many interesting references to instru- ments such as the speculum, uterine sound, cephalotribe, B 2

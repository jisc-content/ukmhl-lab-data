Make the feathers even at the tips and tie the ends with a very fine thread, and anoint with much rosaceum. Also place the patient on her back on a couch, and place a pillow under the loins, and, the woman's thighs being extended and separated, insert a sound and turn it to this side and that till it project.' In all these cases there is no special instrument desig- nated as being used for a uterine sound, only the spathomele (v-nd\€LiTTpov) and the olivary probe named. With both of these we have met before. However, I have thought it of historical interest to cast these passages together.

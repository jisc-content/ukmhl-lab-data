32 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS 1I push in the ' long scalpelfor thus I describe the one with two cutting edges meeting in one at the tip.' "What Galen means by irpofirjK^s when applied to an instru- ment he has himself explained in a note on the chapter by Hippocrates on the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder. He applies it to instruments long in proportion to their breadth (see p. 118). The knife referred to here is a large strong instrument, for it is intended for cutting through the lateral processes of the vertebrae. Phlebotome.

Although venesection is one of the most frequently men- tioned operations, and although the phlebotome is one of the most frequently named instruments, we have no passage giving even the most meagre description of this instrument. It is assumed that its appearance would be familiar to every- one, since phlebotomy was so common. Celsus tells us that every one old and young was bled. Sanguinem, incisa vena, mitti, novum non est, sed nullum paene morbum esse in quo non mittatur novum est (II. x). The operation continued just as frequent all through the Eoman period, and the writings on venesection are very voluminous. Galen has three treatises on the subject. The operation was performed in exactly the same way as at the present day, and the lancet was apparently the same as that figured in modern instrument catalogues, viz. sharp-pointed, double-edged, and straight. A consideration of all the various operations to which the phlebotome was put bears this out. The following passage from Hippocrates shows that there were various sizes of the phlebotome : Tot? ye fxa*)(cupLois ofecrt Set xpyaOaL kcli 7rAareo-t, ovk eVt itavrw ojuotcos i:apayyek\op.€vi ktA.

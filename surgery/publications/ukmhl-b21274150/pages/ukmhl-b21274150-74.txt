PL XI, figs. 5 and 3 show single olive probes for the appli- cation of semi-solid medicaments. The former is from the outfit of the oculist of Rheims, in the Museum at St- Germain-en-Laye; the latter, more highly ornamented by spirally twisting the stem, is from my own collection.

The following passage from Theodoras Priscianus refers to its use for applying ointment to an affected part:

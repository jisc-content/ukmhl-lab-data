SYEINGES 115 Paul says 1 Some apply a tube (kclXciuCo-kov) round about the barbs' (VI. lxxxviii). Celsus (III) mentions a narrow tube of this sort for drink- ing water through in cases of nocturnal thirst. Paul (VI. xxiv and III. xxiii) says that foreign bodies may be sucked from the ear with a reed. Quill. Greek, tttlXov. Galen (x. 1011) says that warts may be extracted by means of quills of feathers. Paul quotes this (VI. lxxxvii) : Â£ Some, among whom are Galen, advise us to scarify round the wart with the quill of a hard feather, such as those of old geese or of eagles, and to push it down so as to remove the wart from its roots. Others do the same with a copper or iron tube.' Aretaeus says a quill may be used for blowing powder into the pharynx (408, vol. ii).

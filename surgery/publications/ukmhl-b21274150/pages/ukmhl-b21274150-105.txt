89 PEOBES Scribonius Largus (xxxix) says : Ad auriculae dolorem et tumorem sine ulcere prodest herbae urceolaris aut cucurbitae ramentorum sucus tepens per strigilem in foramen auris dolentis infusus. The strigil varied much in size and shape. A common form was a sickle-shaped instrument, the circular part being hollow and semicircular on section, and admirably adapted for warming and pouring oil and other medicaments into the ear as above described. PL XXV, fig. 1 shows a small strigil from my collection. Spoon for applying astringent liquids to the uvula. Greek, (TTa(f)vkâ‚¬7:dpTr]s. In his description of the medical treatment of diseases of the mouth Paul (III. xxvi) says: ' When the uvula is inflamed we must use the gargles recommended for inflammation of the tonsils, and those of a moderately astringent nature, such as the juice of pome- granate, applied by means of a spoon or the instrument called the " uvula medicator " 5 (o-Tatyvke-ndpTov). It is evident that it is quite a different instrument from the staphylocaustus (q. v.), which we are specially told had more than one hollow and was a grasping instrument like a forceps. The present instrument is for applying liquids, and was apparently of the form of a spoon. Fabricius describes and figures such an instrument. It is a small round spoon with a long handle.

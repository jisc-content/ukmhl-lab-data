CAUTEEIES 117 Cautery Knife. Greek, Â£vpa<$>iov. Paul on several occasions mentions the use of the cautery knife. In radical cure of hydrocele, as an alternative to the excision of the sac by the knife, he explains how it may be done with the cautery, and says, 1 Afterwards, when the whole is laid bare, we stretch it with hooks and remove it with a sword-shaped cautery (p.ayaip(t)Tu> KavrrjpL)1 (VI. lxii). Galen, speaking of cancer, says, * Some use heated razor blades (gvpaQCois), at once cutting and burning' (xiv. 786). Trident Cautery.

Vulpes describes an instrument of bronze which he con- siders to be a trident-shaped cautery. It was found along side an instrument which I take to be a phlebotome. If it is for the purpose described above by Paul it is unusual in being of bronze, and it must have lost a good part of its teeth. Olivary Cautery.' Greek, irvprjvoeihhs Kavrr\piov. Malignant polypus of the nose is removed, says Paul (VI. xxv), with olivary pointed cauteries {nvprjvoeibh kclvtti- piov); and again, quoting Leonidas, he says empyema may be opened in the same way (VI. xliv). The special cautery which was, used fore aegilops' (fistula lachrymalis) was probably an olivary pointed cautery, as the cautery recommended by both Scultetus and Pare for this is an olivary pointed one. Paul (VI. xxii) says, 1 Some after excision of the flesh use a perforator, and make a passage for the fluid or matter to the nose, but we are content with

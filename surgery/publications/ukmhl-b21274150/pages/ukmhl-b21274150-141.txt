BONE AND TOOTH INSTRUMENTS 125 not be wounded, being in contact only with the flat part of the lenticular, and if it be adherent anywhere to the cal- varium the flat part of the lenticular removes its adhesion without trouble. And behind it follows the incisor or lenticular itself, dividing the skull, so that it is impossible to discover another method of operating more free from danger or more expeditious.' The earliest illustration of the lenticular I have been able to obtain is that given by Vidus Vidius (PI. XL, fig. 2). It evidently is the same instrument as that described by Galen. Hammer, Greek, a-cpvpa; Latin, malleolus. I have already quoted passages where the hammer is referred to as being used in cranial surgery. Paul says: 'When you apply the flat part of the lenticular to the meninges divide the skull by striking with a small the hammer/ and again in using gouges, ' strike gently with hammer (o-tyvpa) to avoid concussion of the head' (VII. xc). Paul and Celsus describe a method of extracting foreign bodies from the ear by laying the patient on a board and striking the under side with a mallet. Pare mentions a hammer made of lead, and Fabricius describes one padded with leather, but neither of these is described by the ancients. There is, however, a Roman hammer of lead from ; the excavation at Uriconium in the Shrewsbury Museum. Block. Greek, Hlkottov, a butcher's block.

In describing the plastic removal of a portion of the scrotum Paul (VI. lxvii) says: * Leonidas, laying the patient on his back, cuts off the redundant portion upon a chopping block of any kind of

PEEFACE vii companion of my wanderings among the continental museums. I have also to thank my father, John Milne, LL.D., for much help at many different points. The expense of visiting the museums in the North of France and of obtaining photographs of the instruments in them has been borne by a grant from the Carnegie Univer- sity Research Fund. This monograph was presented as the thesis which forms part of the examination for the degree of M.D. of the University of Aberdeen, and it was successful in gaining ' Highest Honours.'

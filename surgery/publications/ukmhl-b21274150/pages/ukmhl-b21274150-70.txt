54 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS (I. viii. 21, ed. Eose) he uses the transliteration pyrena meles. But this is African Latin. A probe without enlargement at the tip was called aTtvpr]voixr\k7) or airvpoixrikr]. The ear probe is frequently referred to as belonging to this class. These probes without nuclei were specially adapted for wrapping round with wool to apply medicaments, or wipe away discharge. The size of the nucleus varied in different varieties of probe, but was pretty constant in each particular. It was largest in the probe known as the spathomeleâ€”a combination of spatula and probe which was in extremely common use for pharmaceutical purposes. The nucleus of this probe was such a well-known object that it is frequently referred to as a standard of size and shape. Galen (ii. 898) says: * In the cervix uteri is the foramen by which the woman both passes the monthly flux and receives the semen of the husband. By it also the foetus leaves the womb. It is marvellous how it varies in size according to circum- stances. "When the woman is not pregnant it admits the nucleus of a probe or something slightly larger' (irvprjva pJkv Here Kiihn translates irvprjm by 1 acuminatum capitulum specilliwhich is incorrect. It is an olivary enlargement, not sharp point. In Paul (VI. xc), we have the nucleus given at the measure of distance between the perforations by which a bone was surrounded preparatory to its excision by means of chisels: ' the space between the perforations made by the drills should be the breadth of the nucleus of a probe ' (to juij/cos nvprjvos). Aetius (III. i. 16) says in volvulus the sphincter ani is so contracted that the nucleus of a probe cannot be got in. Paul (VI. xxi) says that in couching a cataract we must enter the couching needle a nucleus breadth from the iris. Besides its use as a sound the nucleus was frequently used as a means of applying medicaments, either in the form of ointments or dry powder, to affected parts.

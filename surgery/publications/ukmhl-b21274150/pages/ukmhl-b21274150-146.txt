130 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS It is best to have several for every thickness of the cal- varium ; for thicker bone longer are required, for thinner bone shorter.' Paul (VI. xc) says : ' But if the bone is strong it is first to be perforated with that kind of perforators called abaptista (TtepiTpv-nrio-avTzs a(3cnTTL(TTOL$ rots Xeyofxtvois), which have certain eminences to prevent them sinking down to the membrane, and then with chisels we remove the bone not whole, but in pieces.' The illustrations of drills given from Vidius (PI. XLII) are really abaptista. Saw. Greek, 7t/hW, fxa^aipcoros itpicav (as if from ixa\aLp6a)); Latin, serrula. The saw is very frequently mentioned in the description of operation on bone. Celsus (VII. xxxiii), in describing the amputation of a gangrenous limb, says : Dein id serrula praecidendum est, quam proxime sanae carni etiam inhaerenti: ac turn frons ossis, quam serrula exasperavit, laevanda est. And Paul says that in amputating a gangrenous limb the flesh ought to be retracted with a band lest it be torn by the saw. Saws were also used in cranial surgery. Hippocrates frequently mentions a saw (irpiwv) in this con- nexion, but it is evident that he means the trephine, as he describes its circular motion. Paul, however, makes it quite clear that he means flat cranial saws, for he mentions both saws and trephines in one paragraph: "Hbrj Kal tq)v TTpLOvuiV re kol \oivLKihmv x^tpoupytat, kt\. ' The method of operating with saws and trephines is condemned by the moderns as a bad one' (VI. xc). PI. XLI, fig. 3 shows a surgical saw from the British Museum (No. 2,328). It is of bronze, and measures 112 mm. long, 3 cm. broad at one end, narrowing to 23 mm. at the other. There are surgical saws of steel in the Naples Museum. Many of the saws extant are for use as' frame' saws. Others have the saw portion continuous with the handle, like a knife.

In Celsus the instrument appears under the term corvus. In describing the opening of the scrotal sac in the operation for the radical cure of hernia he says: Deinde earn ferramento, quod a similitudine corvum vocant, incidere sic ut intrare duo digiti, index et medius, possint (VII. xix). Vulpes (Tav. VII, 3 and 4) figures two curved bistouries from the Naples Museum. They have lost their tips. Both are of the same shape, but one has the blade slightly larger than the other. The handles are of bronze, the blades of steel. A good example is seen in the Athens scalpel box (PI. IV). A powerful variety so strongly curved as to resemble a small billhook was found in the Eoman hospital at Baden (PI. IX, fig. 5). The handle is of ivory, the blade is of steel, and there is a mounting of bronze. Pterygium Knife. Greek, iTTepvyoToiios 6 ; Latin, scalpellus. Paul (VI. xviii), quoting Aetius, II. iii. 60, says that there were two methods of curing pterygium. In the first the pterygium was raised by a small sharp hook, and a needle carrying a horsehair and a strong flaxen thread was passed under it. Tension being made on the thread by an assistant, the operator sawed off the pterygium towards the apex by means of the horsehair. The base of the pterygium was then severed with the scalpel for the plastic operation on entro- pion. The second method consisted in dissecting away the pterygium (stretched as aforesaid with a thread) with the instrument called the pterygotome {jiTepvyoroix^) care being taken not to injure the lids. Aetius (II. iii. 74) says that adhesion of the sclerotic to the lid may be separated by means of the pterygotome. Paul (VI. xxii) in empyema of the lachrymal sac dissects

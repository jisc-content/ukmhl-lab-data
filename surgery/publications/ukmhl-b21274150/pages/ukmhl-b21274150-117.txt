CHAPTEE VI BLEEDING CUPS, CLYSTERS, ETC. Bleeding Cups. Greek, o-tKva, Kvados ; Latin, cucurbitula. The extraction of blood by means of cups has been practised from remote antiquity. The Hindoo Vedas mention it, and it is interesting to note that one of the methods was to apply a gourd with fire in it, for both the Latin cucurbitula and Greek oikvcl signify a gourd. The usual theory as to its action was that in a diseased part there was a vicious irvtvfxa which required removal. Celsus (II. xi) thus describes the different kinds of cups : Cucurbitularum vero duo genera sunt; aeneum, et cor- neum. Aenea, altera parte patet, altera clausa est; cornea, altera parte aeque patens, altera foramen habet exiguum In aeneam linamentum ardens coniicitur, ac sic os eius cor- pori aptatur, imprimiturque donee inhaereat. Cornea per se corpori imponitur; deinde ubi ea parte qua exiguum foramen est ore spiritus adductus est, superque cera cavum id clausum est, aeque inhaerescit. Utraque non ex his tantum materiae generibus, sed etiam ex quolibet alio recte fit. Ac si cetera defecerunt, calieulus quoque, aut pultarius oris compressions, ei rei commode aptatur. Ubi inhaesit, si concisa ante scalpello cutis est, sanguinem extrahit; si integra est, spiritum. 'There are two kinds of cups, bronze and horn. The bronze is open at one end and closed at the other, the horn, open at one end, as in the previous case, has at the other end a small foramen. Into the bronze kind burning lint is placed, and then the mouth is fitted on and pressed until it sticks. The horn one is placed empty on the body, and then by that part where the small foramen is, the air is exhausted by the mouth, and the cavity is closed off above with wax, and it adheres in the same way as before. Either may advantageously be constructed not only of these varieties of

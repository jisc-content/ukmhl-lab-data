114 GBAECO-BOMAN SUBGICAL INSTRUMENTS dare; supraque idem medicamentum iniicere, donee ad cicatricem plaga perveniat (VII. xxviii). A similar tube is recommended by Celsus and Paul for insertion after operations on the rectum and vagina. Hippo- crates (ii. 244) and Paul (VI. xxv) direct a leaden tube to be inserted in the nostril after the abstraction of nasal polypus. After dilation of the cervix uteri a hollow tube was put in to keep it open. The tube was also filled with medica- ments which were intended to have a beneficial effect on the interior of the uterus. The fullest description of this is given by Hippocrates (ii. 799). After describing the dilation of the womb with graduated dilators, he says : ' It is necessary to insert a leaden tube, similar in shape to the largest dilator but hollow so as to contain substances, and the width of the bore will be the same as that used for ulcers, in order that the mouth of the tent may be smooth and do no damage, and it will be prepared like the wooden dilators. When the tent has been prepared fill it with rubbed down mutton fat, and when ready extract the wooden dilator and insert the leaden one.' This leaden dilator is referred to over and over again by Hippocrates. There are in the Naples Museum three of these metal tubes. They are of bronze. One is 18 cm. long, 14 mm. wide at one end, narrowing gradually to 6 mm. at the point (PI. XXXIX, fig. 1). Calamus Scriptorius. Greek, ypcxfriKbs K&kafios; Latin, calamus scriptorius. The writing pen reed is frequently referred to as an implement of minor surgery. Alexander Trallianus (IV. viii) says that a calamus scrip- torius whose joints have been removed may be used as an insufflator. Celsus (VII. v) says that when a weapon buried in the flesh has barbs too strong to be broken with forceps they may be shielded with split writing reeds, and the weapon thus withdrawn: Fissis scriptoriis calamis contegenda, ac, ne quid lacerent, sic evellenda sunt.

The etymology of the word would indicate a blade of the shape of a weaver's spattle, the two edges running into one at the point. Heister (i. 651) and Ehodius (Commentar. in Scrib. Larg. p. 46) agree in making the spathion a large two-edged scalpel, as also does Scultetus, who says of it : Scalpellum ancipitem esse utrimque acutum et in superiore parte paulo latum, qui in extremitate sua in unam cuspidem coiret (Arm. Chir. Tab. II, fig. 1). We shall see that one variety of spathion—that for detaching nasal polypus—was certainly of this shape. B,hodius (loc. cit.) says the hemispathion is a small variety of the spathion. An instrument in the Louvre has two blades of this shape at either end of a round handle ornamented with rolling grooves (PL VIII, fig. 8). Polypus Knife.

Afterwards turning the instrument end for end (avTio-Tptyavres) we bring out the separated fleshy body with the scoop' (t5 KvaOCo-Kio). This description reminds us very forcibly of Celsus's account of the operation : Ferramento acuto modo spathae facto, resolvere ab osse

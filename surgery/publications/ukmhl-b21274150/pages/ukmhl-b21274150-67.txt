CHAPTER IV PROBES GrKEEK, p-far], Koitapiov, inraXenrTpov, vttclXg lttt pis; Latin, specillum. This is a very comprehensive class. The original specil- lum was no doubt a simple sound. Varro thus defines the specillum : ' Quo oculos inunguimus quibus specimus specil- lum est. Graecis /x^A.?/ dicitur.' Thus it meant a probe or sound. fxriXr] is probably derived from an apple or fruit, from the olivary enlargement at the end of a sound.

It is connected with Ko-navov, 'pestle,' K<ynavi(TTr\piov, ' mortar,' and KoiraviCo), ' bray,' and Ko-rndpiov, a medicament pounded in a mortar (Dioscorides, iv. 190).

Thus Paul (VI. lxxviii), in quoting a passage from Hippocrates, substitutes Konapiov for the word /jwjAtj, which Hippocrates uses to denote the sound used for exploring a fistula. Throughout this chapter, in which the word occurs ten times in all, Briau translates it by ' manche du scalpel \ although the whole context shows that a probe is meant.

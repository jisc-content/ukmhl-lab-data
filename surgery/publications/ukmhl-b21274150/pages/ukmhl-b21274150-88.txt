72 GEAECO-EOMAN SUBGICAL INSTEUMENTS stone, or the shell of the cuttlefish, or fig-leaves, or the surgical instrument called blepharoxyston' (8ia rod flkecpapo- £v<ttov KaXovfJLtvov, III. xxii). Heister (vol. i. tab. xvi. p. 591) figures the blepharoxyston as a spoon-shaped instrument burred on the convex side. There is in the Orfila Museum, Paris, an instrument of similar form. It consists of a handle with an olivary point at one end, and at the other a plate with transverse ridges. This agrees well enough with what we know of the classical instrument. It was found in Herculaneum (PI. XYI, fig. 1). Styli and Styloid Specilla. Greek, ypacpiov, ypatydov, ypafyis; Latin, stylus or stilus. The difficulty of deciding as to whether any particular instrument is a surgical or a domestic article is often well illustrated by styloid instruments. In the British Museum several types of instrument will be found classed among surgical instruments, and a series of exactly similar articles will be found repeated among the styli used for inscribing and erasing characters on wax tablets. As even the writing stylus was occasionally used for surgical manipulations we are justified in looking on all styloid instruments as poten- tially implements of minor surgery. The claims of any doubt- ful instrument to be considered as once having been one of a surgeon's tools must be decided on such grounds as the circumstances of its discovery. Galen (xii. 865) says teeth may be extracted with the stylus (ypa(f)€iu> av6.\afie) or with the finger. Hippocrates (i. 46) thus describes the method of extrac- tion of the secundines: 1 Place the patient on the obstetric chair and, leaving the cord uncut, place the child on two bladders filled with water and puncture each of the bladders with a stylus (ypcKpiy) so that the water may slowly flow away.' The writing stylus, then, from the fact of its being at hand and of suitable shape was occasionally, perhaps often, used as a surgical instrument.

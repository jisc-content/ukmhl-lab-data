The apolinose described by Hippocrates (iii. 132) is directed to be made of crude flax (u/jloXivov), the strands of which were stronger than those of dressed lint. This also is what Paul used for the deligation of arteries. Galen alludes to sutures of wool, and Paulus Aegineta in the operation for ectropion says : 'Afterwards we unite the divided parts with a needle carrying a woollen thread, being satisfied with two sutures.' We have no mention of catgut being used for this purpose, though that substance was early known to the Greeks. The Homeric harp was strung with catgut. In fact xÂ°Mi the term for harp-string, simply means intestines. Paul used a woman's hair in a needle to transplant hairs in trichiasis (VI. xiii). Horsehair was used to raise a ptery- gium in Paul VI. xviii, but it is not mentioned as being used for suturing wounds. Serves Fines. Greek, byKTrip ; Latin, fibula. Celsus (V. xxvi) in describing the closing of wounds says: Nam si plaga in molli parte est, sui debet, maximeque si discissa auris ima est, vel imus nasus, vel frons, vel bucca, vel palpebra, vel labrum, vel circa guttur cutis, vel venter. Si vero in came vulnus est hiatque, neque in unum orae facile attrahuntur, sutura quidem aliena est; imponendae vero fibulae sunt; ayKrrjpas Graeci nominant; quae oras paulum tamen contrahant, quo minus lata postea cicatrix sit. 1 Suture is indicated if the lesion is in a soft part, espe- cially in the lobule of the ear, or the ala nasi, or the forehead, or cheek, the edge of the eyelid, or the- skin over the throat, or the abdominal wall. But if the wound is in a muscular part and gape, and the edges cannot easily be opposed, suture is contraindicated, and fibulae (Graece ayKTrjpas) are to be used in order that the cicatrix afterwards may not be wide.'

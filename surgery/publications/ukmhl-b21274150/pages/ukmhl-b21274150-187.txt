171 Etui, etc. them were the remains of sticks of collyria which they had contained. The term collyrium includes in classical writings not only liquid but also solid applications. Collyria were often moulded into sticks for portability, and liquefied with water, wine, white of egg, &c, as required. These boxes which have come down to us are exactly similar to the case shown in PL LIII, but they are on a smaller scale. Slabs for preparation of Ointment. In the Eoman provinces small rectangular slabs are occasionally found which have evidently been used for rubbing medicaments upon. Some have also their edges worn by the sharpening of scalpels. As they are rarely of the stone of the country in which they are found they have evidently been manufactured in Italy and carried by their owners on their travels. They are rather rare. There are two in the museum at Naples. One was discovered in Herculaneum which is 13 cm. long and 8 cm. broad. A cylindrical instrument case is adherent to it. The edges are bevelled on its upper surface. One of similar size and shape, but made of white marble, was found in the grave of the surgeon of Paris. It shows by the hollowing out of one of its edges that it has been used for sharpening scalpels. There are two in the Archaeological Museum at Namur. They are of black marble. They measure 11 cm. by 7-5, but a bevelling of -75 cm. all round reduced the top surface to 9-5 cm. by 6. One of these was found along with surgical instruments in a second-century cemetery at "Wancennes near Namur. There is one of a dark-coloured stone in the museum at Chesters, Northumberland. A small specimen of my own is shown in PI. LII, fig. 4. Similar small slabs, engraved with oculists' names and the names of drugs to serve as seals, have been found in considerable numbers, but these oculists' seals have already an extensive literature of their own.

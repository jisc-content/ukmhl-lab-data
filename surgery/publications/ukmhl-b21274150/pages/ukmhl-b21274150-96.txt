80 GBAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTRUMENTS for correcting malpositions of the uterus, and dilating and applying medicaments to the interior of the cervix. After falling into disuse in the middle ages it was reintroduced by Sir J. Y. Simpson, only to disappear once more almost entirely from sight. I have already referred to Galen's statement that the non-pregnant os is of such a size that it will just admit an olive-pointed probe (p. 54). Hippocrates (ii. 836) directs us to treat hysteria by dilating the cervix, first with an ointment probe and then with the finger.

Soranus (II. x) describes plugging for uterine haemor- rhage by means of the sound : Kal Tpvcfrepbv 'ipiov kvL tivi t&v elprifxevoiv \vku>v hia(3po\ov ftia haKTvXov rj /xrjA?)? -napevriQia-Qto rw arofxarL rrjs varipas.

Hippocrates (iii. 34) alludes to applying medicament to the internal os with the sound : ' Grind the pulp of colocynth, &c, arid rub it up with honey and smear it on the sound (irepi pLrjkrjv) making the consistence such that it can enter the os and always be pushed beyond until it has penetrated to the interior of the uterus. When the medicament has liquefied extract the sound, and again in the same way apply elaterium.' If pus collect in the uterus post partum, or after abortion or from any other cause, it is good practice to pass a sound (p.rjXrjv viraXcLiTTpiba) into the cervix (i. 471). In another place we are directed to draw off gas in the uterus by fomenting the whole body and the uterus with vinegar and water, warmed specilla being afterwards inserted (fjLijXas bLCLTTVpovs tfifidWovTa). Again we find the sound applied to correct malposition of the uterus (iii. 140): ' When the semen is extruded on the third day and the

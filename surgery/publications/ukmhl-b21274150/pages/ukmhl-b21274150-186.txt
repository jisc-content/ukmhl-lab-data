170 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS Box for Scalpels. Among the ruins of the Temple of Aesculapius on the top of the Acropolis at Athens there was found a marble donarium or votive tablet, which represents a box of scalpels flanked by a pair of bleeding-cups. The box reminds one of a modern box for mathematical instruments, being divided into a top and bottom half, each of which contains instruments separated from each other by small blocks. There are three instruments in each half and they are arranged head and tail. Five are scalpels of different shapes; the sixth has a curved cutting instrument at one end and at the other a lithotomy scoop. The size of each half of the box is 9 x 18 cm. outside measurement, and 7 x 16-5 cm. inside. See PL IV. A similar box is seen in a marble tablet in the Capitoline Museum at Eome. Here the instruments are different. Ointment Boxes. Among the instruments of the surgeon of Paris was a box which Deneffe regards as a portable unguentarium. Unlike the medicament boxes it is not divided into compartments and the lid lifts off instead of sliding in grooves. It is 83 mm. long, 45 wide, and 35 deep. A line running round the middle of the box divides it into two equal parts and shows the division between cover and box. On the top is a little ring attached by a little pyramidal eminence 1-5 cm. high by which the cover was lifted off. Several circular ointment boxes, some containing medica- ments, are to be seen in the Naples Museum. Collyrium Boxes. A large number of cylindrical boxes containing sticks of medicament have been found in Pompeii. In the find of the oculist of Eheims there were five cylindrical boxes, all of the same size and shape. They were 14 cm. long and 12 mm. in diameter. The covers are 35 mm. high. In

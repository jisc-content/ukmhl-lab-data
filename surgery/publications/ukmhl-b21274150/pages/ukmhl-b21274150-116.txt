100 GRAECO-ROMAN SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS codices omit rw alixoppoihoKava-rrj, and Cornarius and Dale- champs reject the words r<5 alp.oppo'ihoKav(TTr\ f) rw otck^vAo- Kavarrri as superfluous and interpolated. Apparently they were'unaware that both instruments were forceps of similar principle but different lengths, and quite suitable for putting a haemorrhoid on the stretch. The reason why these instruments are preferred, for this purpose, to the staphy- lagra is apparently that not being toothed like the latter instrument they would be both less painful and less likely to cause bleeding. Pharyngeal Forceps. Greek, 6 at<av6o(36kos. Paul (VI. xxxii) describes a forceps for removing foreign bodies from the pharynx: c Prickles, fish-bones and other substances are swallowed in eating and stick in different places. "Wherefore such as can be seen we are to extract with the special fish-bone forceps ' (rots IbCm aKavdofiokois Trpoo-ayopevopLevoLs Z^kKOjiev). This is the only reference to the acanthobolus I have met with, and it gives us no information as to the appearance of the instrument. It is noteworthy, however, that Paul in his chapter on the removal of spiny bodies from the pharynx is copying Aetius, and the instrument Aetius names is an epilation forceps. He says ' bones stick near the tonsil or back of the pharynx and can be seen, and if a considerable part projects out of the tonsil it can be removed with an epilation forceps (rptxoAa/3up)'. A forceps of the epilation type, but angled in its length, is figured by Vedrenes. It was found in Pompeii. This forceps is eminently suitable for pharyngeal work (PI. XXXII, fig. 1). Albucasis figures an acanthobolus with an up-and-down, not lateral, move- ment.

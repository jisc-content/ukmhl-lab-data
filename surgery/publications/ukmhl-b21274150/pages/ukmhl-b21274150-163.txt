GYNAECOLOGICAL INSTBUMENTS, ETC. 147 breadth. Was it a broad, spoon-like scoop, or was it a book- like instrument ? That tbe latter was the case is proved by the following passage also from Celsus (VII. xxvi): Nonnunquam etiam prolapsus in ipsam fistulam calculus : quia subinde ea extenuatur non longe ab exitu inhaerescit. Eum, si fieri potest, oportet evellere vel oriculario specillo, vel eo ferramento quo in sectione calculus protrahitur.

It should if possible be extracted either with an ear probe, or with the instrument for the extraction of calculus in lithotomy.' This shows that the scoop must have been quite a narrow instrument, or it could not have passed into the urethra. It must have had very much the same appearance as the modern ' Ferguson's Scoop '. We have two extant specimens of the ancient lithotomy scoop in the Naples Museum, one of which is shown in PL IV; and in the marble ex voto tablet in the Athens Museum, to which I have already referred, there is a representation of a manubriolus curved so as to serve as a lithotomy scoop (PI. XLVI, fig. 2). Eufus of Ephesus mentions this form of scalpel handle. Lithotomy Forceps. Was there a forceps for extracting calculus from the bladder ? The sixteenth-century translation of Aetius (IV. iv. 94) by Cornarius has the following passage, under the treatment of calculus in the female : Et tunc paululum supra pudendi alas, quo loco calculus occurrit sectionem facito et per calcularium forcipem ex- trahito. The original Greek of this part of Aetius has not yet been published, but from a pretty intimate knowledge of Cor- narius's methods I have a strong suspicion that' calcularium forcipem ' may be a free translation of \i6ov\k6s, as in the following passage in Paul: ' Sometimes from the pressure of the finger or fingers at the anus the stone starts out readily at the same time as L 2

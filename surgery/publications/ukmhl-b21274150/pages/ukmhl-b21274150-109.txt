FOECEPS 93 forceps a variety with quite narrow blades was used, as Paul (VI. xxiv) tells us that stones, &c. may be removed from the ear with epilation forceps (r/Hx°^a/3«p)> an(^ again in fracture of the nose Paul (VI. xxiv) says that splinters of detached bone are to be removed with these forceps. We have several forceps of this type. There are in the Naples Museum three, one from Pompeii, two from Herculaneum (Deneffe). One from my own collection is shown in PI. XXVI, fig. 2. The points are narrow and rounded. A very interesting form is seen in PL XXVII, fig. 4, which shows a forceps in the Thorwaldsen Museum, Copen- hagen. It is 12 cm. long, of which 6 cm. of the upper end are solid and round. The remainder of the length is occupied by the blades of the forceps, each 5 mm. broad, except for 12 mm. at the extremity, where it expands into a leaf-shaped portion, 10 mm. broad in its broader part. These leaf-shaped expansions oppose each other accurately, and on the narrow part of the blade above them there slides a rectangular catch which serves to clamp the blades and fix them like the jaws of a vice. The surgical epilation forceps is, as we have seen, usually a simple instrument. Occasionally we meet with a forceps combined with some other instrument. These are, as a rule, toilet articles. A pocket ear-scoop and epilation forceps combined was found in Paris. Precisely similar articles of steel may be bought in chemists' shops to-day. Another has a small unguent spatula combined with a forceps, while others carry olivary probes. There are several of these in the St-G-ermain-en-Laye Museum (PI. XXVII, figs. 5, 2). One from Melos, in the Athens Museum, has a porte- caustique. Polypus Forceps. Greek, noXvirogvarris. Galen (Med. Sec. Loc. xii. 685) alludes to the method of extraction of polypus from the nose by means of a forceps (heira Aa^StStoj efatpet), and from what Paul says it would

Paul (VI. lxii), describing the radical cure of hernia, says : ' "Wherefore having heated ten or twelve cauteries shaped like the Greek letter r (ya\nxozihGiv KavT-qpcov) and two cautery knives, we must first burn the scrotum through with the re- shaped ones, &c.'

Cauteries of nail shape are also referred to by Hippocrates in the treatment of recurrent dislocation of the shoulder: ' Raise up the skin.

138 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS ohovraypas). Paul (VI. xc) says that in fracture of the skull the fragment is to be surrounded with perforations by the drill and finally separated with chisels, the chips being removed with the fingers or with tooth forceps, bone forceps, &c. (obovrdypa rj dvT&ypa). Again in ch. lxxxviii he says that if the shaft of a weapon imbedded in the flesh be broken off, the weapon may be extracted with a tooth forceps or a stump forceps (dbovraypas t) pi(dypas). Tooth Elevator. In a note on a passage in Hippocrates describing the lever for replacing the protruding end of a fractured bone, Galen mentions an instrument for levering teeth. He says the instruments for levering the bone are of the same size . as the instrument for levering teeth (xviii. 593). As we know from Paul (VI. cvi) that these bone levers were seven or eight finger breadths in length, we may take this as the length of the tooth elevator. Tooth Scalers. Greek, Â£v<rrripiov, a-pukiov, crixikiuTov (sc. opyavov); Latin, scalper medicinalis. Paul (VI. xxviii) mentions a small raspatory used for removing tartar from teeth : 'The scaly concretions which adhere to teeth we may remove with the scoop of a specillum, or with a scaler (fforrj/oiG)) or a file.' Scribonius Largus (Comp. liii) mentions an excavator : Itaque cum etiam exesus est aliqua ex parte, turn non suadeo protinus tollendum, sed excidendum scalpro medici- nali, qua cavatus est, quod sine ullo fit dolore, reliqua enim solida pars eius et speciem et usum dentis praestabit. Marcellus conveys this passage entire (De Med. xii). Paul (VI. xii) says supernumerary teeth may be cut down with excavators (tG>v ayxiA-icorwi/).

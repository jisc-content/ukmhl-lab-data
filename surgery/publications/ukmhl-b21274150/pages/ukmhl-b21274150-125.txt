SYEINGES 109 Nasal Syringe. Greek, piveyyvrr)?; Latin, rJiinenchytes. A special nasal syringe with a double tube is mentioned by Aretaeus (ed. Adams, vol. ii. 459). The medicament is made into liquid form and is injected by means of a nasal pipe. The instrument consists of two pipes united together by one outlet so that we can inject by both at one time, for to inject each nostril separately is a thing which could not be borne. Galen also mentions a nasal syringe (ptyeyx^s), though he does not describe it (xi. 125). Scribonius Largus also mentions it : Per nares ergo purgatur caput his rebus infusis per cornu quod rhinenchytes vocatur (Compositiones, vii). Aspiration Syringe and Sinus Irrigator. Greek, ttvovXkos. Galen (xi. 125) says : ' In cases of sinus he uses a tube of bronze or horn with a straight bore, or otherwise the instrument called the pus extractor (ttvovXkov), which has a wide bore. But if you inject rosaceum into the former (i. e. tube of bronze, &c.) it will not pass through the syringe (ttvovXk<2), so that in that case a pipe of wide bore is to be fixed to a sow's bladder.' This passage shows that the pyulcus differed in principle from the syringe formed by fixing a bladder on a tube. Hero (De Spiritalibus, c. 57) shows that it was a syringe formed of a cylinder of metal with a well-fitting plunger. Hero says: 'And the instrument called pyulcus works on the same principle. ' For a long tube AB is made, to which let there be fitted another CD, and let C, the end of it, be closed by a plate. At D let it have a handle EF, and let the mouth of the tube AB at A be blocked by a plate furnished with a slender syringe GH, perforated. * When therefore we wish to draw out pus, applying the extreme mouth H of the little syringe to the place in which the pus is, by the handle we draw the tube CD outward,

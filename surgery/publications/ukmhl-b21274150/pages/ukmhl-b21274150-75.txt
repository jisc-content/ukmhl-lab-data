PEOBES 59 Si veluti carbunculus innatus fuerit, lycium cum melle contritum suppono frequenter per diem et spathomela temptante (Euporiston, xxvii). Aetius (II. iv. 16) directs a particular medicament to be rubbed in and to be scraped off after a moderate space of time with a spathomele (tt) a-naQoixri\rj). The spathomele was used by painters for preparing and mixing their colours. The very large numbers in which they are found would indicate that their use was not confined to medical men. Although the nucleus of the spathomele was too large to admit of its use as a probe for small lesions, it is evident that in exploring large cavities it must have been a valuable instrument. Galen (ii. 712) says: ' In small bodies the opening into the torcular Herophili may not be large enough to admit a spathomele nucleus, and therefore we must try some of the other olivary probes or even an ear probe, and cut alongside it.' Priscianus alludes to plugging the nares with it: Prius spathomeles extremo in baca molli lana obvoluto glebas sanguinis e naribus frequentius purgare nos convenit, post lana identidem obturando perclaudere (xiv). ' First of all we must frequently wipe away the clots of blood from the nose with the end of a spathomele wrapped on the' berry' with soft wool, and then occlude it by plugging with wool in the same way.' From Leonidas (Aetius, VI) we learn that it was used as a tongue depressor. He says: ' In inflammation of the throat in adults seat the patient, open his mouth and depress the tongue with a tongue depressor or a spathomele, and open the abscess with a scalpel or a needle-knife.' The following passage from Galen shows that it was used as a substitute for the meningophylax (q. v.): 'Having separated the pleura from the rib and placed a thin meningophylax or a flat spathomele (<n:adoixr\k'r)v irXaraav) between the ribs, and taking care that you neither

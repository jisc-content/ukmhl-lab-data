ETUI, ETC. 169 Portable Probe Cases. The spatulae, sounds, hooks, and forceps were carried about in a cylindrical case of bronze. Several of these etui have been found containing instruments. They average 18 cm. in length and 1-5 cm. in diameter. The lid lifts off. One in the museum at Lausanne was found in a Roman conduit at Bosseaz and contained a cyathiscomele of the usual type (Bonstetten, Recueil des Antiqq. Suisses, pi. xii, figs. 11 and 12). A case exactly similar to the above con- taining a cyathiscomele and a toothed vulsellum was found in the Rhine Valley. Another case of the same kind was found at Bregenz. It contained a long ligula, a spathomele, a cyathiscomele, and a double olivary probe. In the Naples Museum are four of these cases, three of which were found in Pompeii and one in Herculaneum. One of these is a plain cylindrical case 18 cm. long and 1-5 in diameter. It contained instruments (PL LIII, fig. 1). Another case is ornamented with raised rings. It was found in the House of the Physician, and contained six specilla of different kinds and a vulsellum. A third is of similar size and shape, but it is considerably destroyed by oxidation, and it is adherent to a rectangular slab of black stone which had been used for mixing medicaments. Through the cracks in the case there may be seen the probes which it contains. The case from Herculaneum is a plain cylindrical case 19 cm. long and 2 cm. in diameter. Lately, several other cases have been found in Italy which are placed in the Naples Museum. One in a fragmentary condition showing its contents is seen in PL LIII, fig. 2. In the Musee de Cinquantenaire, Brussels, there is one of these cases which was brought by M. Ravenstein from Italy. It contained three instruments all of silver, a cyathiscomele, a grooved director, and a plain double-ended stylet. It is 18 cm. long and 1-5 in diameter. A fragment of a similar case was found in the Roman I Hospital at Baden.

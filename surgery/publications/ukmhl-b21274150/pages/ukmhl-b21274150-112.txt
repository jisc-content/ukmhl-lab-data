96 GRAECO-ROMAN SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS Extant specimens of the vulsellum are common. A simple variety is formed by folding a plate of bronze on itself, as in PI. XXVIII, fig. 1, which shows a specimen in the British Museum. The jaws are finely toothed. More usually the myzon is formed by sawing a plate of bronze partly along its midline as in PI. XXIX, fig. 2, which is taken from the find of the oculist Severus. An interesting variation is seen in the specimen shown in PI. XXVIII, fig. 3 which is from my own collection. The line of junction of the jaws instead of being in the median plane is sloping. The object of this arrangement is not quite clear. A small variety of the vulsellum is referred to by Aetius : ' Epulis we seize with a small vulsellum and excise with a small scalpel' (fj znovXls /xt;5ioo-KeAAa> airoTadeia-a eKTtfxvecrOoo <j/xiXapt(i) o-Te^a), vii. 24, 25). We have one or two of these instruments. They remind one of fixation forceps. I illustrate one in PL XXIX, fig. 3. It is from the Mainz Museum. There are four similar ones in the Frankfort Historical Museum. The specimen shown in PL XXVIII, fig. 2, from the Naples Museum, is inter- esting as being stamped with the name of the maker, Acachcolus. We have now to consider an interesting variation pro- duced by extending the extremity of the blade to one side so as to increase the width of the blade (coudee type). This is a rare type. PI. XXIX, fig. 1 represents one of two from the find of the surgeon of Paris. It is 17 cm. long, and the legs of the forceps are 8 mm. wide. The jaws debouch to one side at an obtuse angle for a distance of 2 cm. and end in a fairly sharp point. The jaw is thus increased to 2 cm. in breadth. They are finely toothed. They are concave internally and convex externally. The other forceps was 14-5 cm. long and 8 mm. wide. The Museum at Naples has a forceps of this type, but having a sliding ring to fix the jaws after they have been applied (PL XXIX, fig. 4).

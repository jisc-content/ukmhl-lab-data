47 KNIVES we know nothing. It is mentioned by Paul as a special scalpel for excision of the uvula : * "Wherefore, having seated the patient in the sunlight and directed him to gape wide, we seize with the uvula forceps or a common tenaculum upon the elongated part and drag it downwards and excise it with the instrument called the uvula knife (<rra(/>t;A.oro/uto), or the scalpel used for the plastic operation on the eyelid ' (VI. xxxi). The knife figured by Albucasis as used for the purpose is a small curved bistoury (PI. IX, fig. 4). "We have no other means of determining its shape.

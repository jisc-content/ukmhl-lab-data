40 GRAECO-ROMAN SUBGICAL INSTRUMENTS oportet. Ubi abscissus est unco ferramento extrahendus est (VII. x). These passages, especially that from Paul, show that like the majority of Roman instruments the polypus scalpel was a double instrument, with a sharp-pointed leaf- shaped blade at one end and a scoop at the other.

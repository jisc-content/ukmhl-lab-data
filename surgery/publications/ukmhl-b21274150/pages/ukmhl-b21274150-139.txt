BONE AND TOOTH INSTEUMENTS 123 VI. xliii). In using the chisel as an osteotome one chisel was often placed behind the bone to steady it while it was being struck by another in front. This method of applying two chisels, which is only described by the Greek authors, is always referred to by the phrase e/cK07reW avTi0zT(ov. q The following passage from Galen fully describes the manipulation (ii. 687): ' Separate off thejnembranes adhering to the bone, which being properly done, divide the bone of the rib by means of two chisels placed in opposition to each other secundum artem' (<Wi/3aAAofxei>(02; bvolv dAArjAois €kkott4cov g>s %6os). The following passage from Paul shows the chisel used for a similar purpose: 'If part of the clavicle is broken off and unconnected, and if we find it irritating the parts, we must make a straight incision with a scalpel and remove the broken portion and smooth it with chisels (hi cKKoirioov), taking care that the instrument called * meningophylax' (q. v.), or another chisel, be put under the clavicle (ixriviyyofyvkaKos rj €T€pov €KK07reo)s) to steady it' (VI. xciii). The phrase hi €K/co7reW <Wi0eVoozj, which Paul uses in describing the treatment of a fistula leading to carious bone, is translated by Briau—'a l'aide de tenailles tran- chantes'. It does seem here, and occasionally in other passages, as if the phrase might suggest' cutting forceps', but we have no knowledge of such an instrument being used by surgeons in classical times, and the passages from Paul and Galen show that only two chisels are meant. We may compare the passage on extraction of the foetus in Paul (VI. lxxiv), where he directs a second hook to be fixed on opposite the first (/ecu clvtlOztov rovrw bevrcpov). Gouge.

Celsus never does so by any special name, although it is evident

78 GRAECO-ROMAN SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS on one shaft. Brunner (loc. cit.) figures a number of ligulae from the Swiss museums. These he names specilla oricu- laria, although admitting that they are only domestic articles. I have shown, however, that the specillum oricu- larium is a well-defined combination of scoop and probe. Plate XVIII shows a variety of ligulae from various sources, some simple, some combined instruments. Figs. 4, 5, 8 are most typical forms. Some of this simple type are two feet in length. They are often overlaid with gold. Fig. 7 shows a ligula which has so been treated. It carries a small fork on which to poise a pellet of semi-solid medicament. Spoons for measuring, preparing, and pouring medicaments. A type of spoon not uncommonly met with has a round bowl about 2 cm. in diameter, and a handle of about 10 cm. long. Usually they are of bronze; but occasion- ally they are of silver, and a considerable number in bone were found in the Roman Hospital at Baden. They are for measuring medicaments, heating them, and removing them from unguentaria, &c. They are often found alongside the glass unguentaria which contained the salves. They were also used for religious purposes. Similar spoons with pointed handles are common in finds of domestic articles. The sharp end is for extracting shell- fish, &c. A larger variety of the unguent spoon has a spout to assist in pouring the contents. This variety is rather rare. PI. XIX, fig. 4 is from the British Museum. The bowl is 2-5 cm. in diameter and the handle is 15 cm. long. The handle is round, and it has a small ringed ornamentation at its end and one close to the bowl. The bottom has been thinned out with heat, and there is a small perforation visible in it. A similar spoon was found in the grave of the Paris surgeon. Traces of medicament remain on it. This type is probably intended for warming salves and pouring them into the eye and other affected parts. Another variety

46 GKAECO-BOMAN SUBGICAL INSTBUMENTS hairs which, are normal, extending from canthus to canthus and penetrating only the depth of the skin. Afterwards we make the incision called the crescent-shaped, beginning at the same place as the former and carrying it upwards to such a height as to enclose the whole superabundant skin and ending in like manner as it did. Thus the whole skin within the incision will have the shape of a myrtle leaf. Having perforated the angle of this portion with a hook we dissect away the whole skin. Then washing away the clots with a sponge we unite the lips of the incision with three or four sutures' (VII. viii). The use of the scalpel for the plastic operation, therefore, was to make an incision in the eyelid in such a way as to enclose a leaf-shaped area and to dissect off the skin sur- rounded by the incision. Albucasis figures it as a small but fairly broad blade with a rounded cutting tip (PL IX, %â€¢ 3). It must have been a small scalpel to suit the operation described, and to make the dissection indicated it must have been sharp-pointed. It is contrasted to some extent with the pterygotome by Paul, and we saw that the ptery- gotome was narrow and sharp-pointed. These various references to its use are in agreement with the supposition that it was of the shape figured by Albucasis. I have considered it here because the question of its shape is rather hypothetical, and therefore it seemed best to consider it close by its confrere the pterygotome. "We may recall the fact that in the grave of the third-century oculist Severus several tiny scalpel handles were found. These were probably handles for these two ophthalmic scalpels, but un- fortunately only a trace of the steel remains. Vedrenes, in his edition of Celsus, figures an instrument from Pompeii of a shape which we are accustomed to associate with eye work (PL IX, fig. 6). Uvula Knife. Greek, arcujyvXoToiAOV.

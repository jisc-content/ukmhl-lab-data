73 PROBES I give a figure of a stylus in silver, beautifully oxidized, which was found at York while making excavations there in constructing the railway (PL XVII, fig. 3). PL XVII, fig. 6 shows an instrument which is figured by Vulpes (op. cit.) as a specillum. Personally, I think its highly ornamented form shows that it is rather a domestic article, but, as no information is available as to the sur- roundings among which it was found, we can only say that its shape fits it equally well either for writing or minor surgical manipulations. Grooved Director. Although we have no actual description of a grooved director, we have many manipulations described in which such an instrument would be used nowadays. For example, in describing the treatment of fistulae Celsus says: In has demisso specillo ad ultimum eius caput incidi cutis debet (VII. iv). 'A director being inserted into them down to their termination the skin ought to be incised.' It is interesting to find that we have at least one grooved director extant to prove that this instrument was known to the Romans. It is in the Section of Surgical Antiquities of the Musee de Cinquantenaire, Brussels, and it was dis- covered, along with several other surgical instruments, in a surgeon's case of the usual cylindrical form. It is 15 cm. long, 2 mm. in diameter. A deep groove runs for 6 cm. from one end. The other end terminates in a small button. It is of silver, as also were the other contents of the case. It is possible that grooved specilla may have been in quite common use, but may have been made of wood or tin, and have therefore not survived; because we learn from Galen's Manual of Dissection that probes which were used as directors in dissecting work were generally of wood, such as boxwood, so that they might not chip the scalpel (ii. 711).

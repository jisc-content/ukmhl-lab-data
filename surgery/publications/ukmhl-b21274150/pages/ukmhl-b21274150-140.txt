124 GEAECO-BOMAN SUEGICAL INSTBUMENTS that many of the manipulations he describes as being performed by the * scalper', his general term for chisels of all kinds, could only be performed with gouges and not with flat chisels. The gouge was a favourite instrument of Galen's, especially in injury to the skull. With it he re- moved pieces of fractured bone from the skull. He also used it to groove a path for the vertical cutting instrument called the lenticular (q. v.). He calls it a ' hollow chisel' (t&v Koikoav iKKOTtioov ovs Kal kvk\Â£(tkovs ovoixa^ovcriv, X. 445). Paul (VI. xc) says : c And if the bone be weak, naturally, or from the fracture, we cut it out with gouges (o-kvAio-kwtois), beginning first with the broader ones, and changing to the narrower, and then using those which are probe-like, striking gently with the mallet to prevent concussion of the head.' The gouge is still familiar to us. Lenticular. Greek, (paKutros. The lenticular of the ancients was a vertical chisel cutting on one edge and struck on the other by a hammer, while the end carried a rounded button, which being smooth did not injure the brain (Pi. XL, fig. 4). It takes its name from the lentil-like (QaKotTos) shape of the button. Galen had a high appreciation of it, and gives a full description of its principle (x. 445), which is transcribed by Paul (VI. xc): ' The method of operating with a sort of incisor called lenticular is greatly praised by Galen, being performed without drilling after the part has been grooved all round with gouges.' Wherefore he says: ' If you have once exposed the place, then applying the chisel, which has at its point a blunt (rounded), smooth, lentil-shaped knob, but which longitudinally is sharp, when you apply the flat part of the lenticular to the meninges divide the cranium by striking with the small hammer. For we have all that we require in such an operation, for the membrane, even if the operator were half asleep, could

A small variety of the blunt hook is mentioned by Celsus, Galen, and Paul. Of the extraction of foreign bodies from the ear Celsus says : Sin aliquid exanime est, specillo oriculario protrahendum est, aut hamulo retuso paulum recurvato (VI. vii). Paul says that if stones of fruits, &c. fall into the ear they must be extracted with an ear scoop, a hook, or a forceps. Both types of blunt hook are represented by extant speci- mens ; see PI. XXIII, figs. 3, 4. These remind us of our aneurism needles, and it is interesting to note that Galen (ut supra) speaks of an ' eyed hook'. The instruments shown in PL XXIII, figs. 2, 4 we might look on either as curved retractors or dissectors as they are half sharp. PI. XXV, fig. 2 shows a hook of crotchet-hook type combined with a scoop. It is from Herculaneum. The Strigil Greek, fvorpa. Latin, strigil. It seems to have been a common method of applying remedies to the auditory canal to warm them in a strigil and pour them in with it. Galen frequently mentions this. In Med. Sec. Loc. (xii. 622) he says: ^ Having warmed the fat of a squirrel in a strigil, instil it. Celsus (VI. vii. 1) says: In aurem vero infundere aliquod alimentum oportet quod semper ante tepefieri convenit; commodissimeque per strigilem instillatur. Marcellus (IX. 1) says: Conteres et in strigili calefacies, et infundes, et lana occludes aurem.

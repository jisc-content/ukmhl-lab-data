50 GEAECO-EOMAN SUEGICAL INSTEUMENTS We have also two references in Paulus Aegineta. He says some of the moderns effect a cure of warty excrescences on the penis by a pair of shears (\jra\Cbi, VI. Iviii), and dealing with relaxation of the scrotum he says that An- tyllus, having first transfixed the superfluous skin with three or four ligatures, cut off what was external to them with a pair of sharp-pointed shears or a scalpel (tyakibi tiraKiJLu rj 07x1 A??), and having secured the parts with sutures he effected healing with the treatment for recent wounds. Shears are very common objects in museums. Some are of bronze and some are of steel. Judging from the relative numbers in which they have been preserved it would seem that the steel shears far outnumbered the bronze. In PL X, fig. 5 is shown a bronze pair from the Naples Museum, found in Pompeii.

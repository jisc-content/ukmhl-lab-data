GYNAECOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS, ETC. 155 Cephalotribe. Whether or not the instrument last described was used also for the operation of cephalotripsy, or whether there was a special instrument, we cannot say, but it is certain that the operation of crushing the head and delivering the child without removing the bones was practised.

Then to some part of it fix on a traction hook and make traction, and the legs becoming straightened out we get it away.'

The cephalotribe figured by :Albucasis is not essentially different from his cranioclast see PL LI, fig. 4). Midwifery Forceps. Had the Greeks and Romans a forceps for extracting the :hild alive ? Probably not. We have no mention of any uch instrument by Soranus or Paul, both accomplished ibstetricians, nor can any description of such an instrument >e found in the voluminous pseudo-Hippocratic works on yomen. Adams, in a note to Paul,(lII. lxxvi,)says that jhough the Eoman and Greek writers do not mention the orceps, Avicenna does so, and he says that a forceps was dug p in the house of an obstetrix at Pompeii bearing a con- iderable resemblance to the modern forceps. The only j assage I have met with in the slightest degree supporting he notion that the ancients ever delivered the child alive dth instruments is one in the pseudo-Hippocratic treatise We Superfoetatione, where we are told that:

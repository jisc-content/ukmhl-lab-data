From the fact that emery is found in Naxos one might conclude that the Naxian whetstone was of emery, but a few lines before the passage quoted from Paul he has already mentioned the emery: *H 5e <jp.vpis pvTTTiKrjv Uxovaa hvvap.iv dhovTas (r/xr/^et. {The emery having detergent powers cleanses teeth.' Galen makes the Naxian stone a variety of ostracites which was apparently marble formed of shells. One of the marble ointment tablets had, we saw, been used as a whetstone, but the whetstones for which ISTaxos was famous must, if not emery, have been some variety of shale or slate.

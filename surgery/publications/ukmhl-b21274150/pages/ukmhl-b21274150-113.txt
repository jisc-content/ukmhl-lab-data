FOECEPS 97 This angled type of forceps may be the one referred to by Paul in his description of the plastic operation on the eye- lid for trichiasis (VI. viii), when he directs us to raise the redundant skin of the lid with a fixation forceps and cut it off with a scalpel (/3Ae(/>apoKaro)(({> /uvSup, tovt <k<JTi "npds Ti)v ir€pL<p€p€iav tov fiXecpapov kfryaTuriAtvod avareivavTts to irepLTTov hip\xa. o-jouAto) airoKo-nTovo-i). It may be noted that this coudee type of forceps has considerable affinity with the type of forceps presently to be described for strangling haemorrhoids and the relaxed uvula, the only essential difference being that the blades are not crossed here. Uvula Forceps. Greek, o-Ta<f)vXaypa. In Aetius (II. iv. 12) we have an interesting description of the amputation of the uvula by first crushing it in a forceps so as to prevent haemorrhage and then cutting it off: 'Then inserting a vulsellum and making traction on it, the uvula crusher (tt)v o-rafyvXaypav) is fitted on about the middle of the uvula or a little below it, and then it is pulled and twisted (by the vulsellum). By the torsion it becomes lifeless and, as it were, snared off; it curls up, becomes livid and comes off without much effusion of blood. Where- fore it is well to wait some time and hold it till the patient can stand it no longer, and then cut it off—the cut being made close to the vulsellum but nearer the tip than to it.' The arafyvXaypa therefore corresponds in its action to a pile-crusher. This instrument I believe to be represented by the type of forceps shown in PI. XXX, fig. 1. It is in the British Museum. The two branches of the forceps cross like scissor blades, and at their ends the jaws are formed in such a way as to project forwards and enclose a cavity 1 cm. deep and 18 mm. long. Over all the forceps is 18 cm. long. The jaws are finely toothed. There is in the same museum another instrument similar in all respects except that it is 1 cm. shorter, and that in each blade, which is 16 mm. long (PL XXX, fig. 2), there is a small hole near the proximal end. A posterior view of a similar instrument is seen in MILNE H

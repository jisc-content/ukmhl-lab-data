Early Egyptian writings refer to rectal enemas : numerous prescriptions, including several for nutrient enemas, are given. Oribasius gives us many interesting particulars about enemas (Collect. VIII. xxiv). The amount necessary is less for men than for women. In any case the largest amount is three heminae (rpds kotvXol), the smallest one hemina (a small half pint). In dysentery and other cases where the parts would be easily hurt, and where a prompt evacuation was required, cannulae with the opening placed in the side were used. Cannulae with the opening in the end of the instrument were used where a large evacuation was desired to be brought down from the higher parts. To destroy ascarides, cannulae with a circle of small holes placed laterally were used. * From ch. xxxii we learn that the injection pipe varied in length also, for Oribasius says that in making injections into the rectum for affections of the bladder (e. g. to excite expulsion of urine in cases of retention), the tube (to Kepas rod KXvarripos) ought to be short. In the case of nutrient enemas Mnesitheus says the tube ought to be extremely long, and in admitting an injection one ought to keep up compression of the empty part of the clyster because it often happens that the injection returns from the rectum unless this is done (Oribas. viii).

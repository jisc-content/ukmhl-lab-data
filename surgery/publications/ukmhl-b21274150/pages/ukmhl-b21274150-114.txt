98 GRAECO-ROMAN SUEGICAL INSTRUMENTS PL XXXI, fig. 1. It is from the find of the surgeon of Paris. A similar specimen is in the Mainz Museum. PL XXXII, fig. 3 shows a smaller specimen from the Naples Museum. It is 11 cm. in length. A large powerful variety with a different arrangement of the handles is seen in PL XXXI, fig. 2 from a specimen in the Antiquarian Museum at Basle. It is 20 cm. long. A forceps which I take to be a staphylagra occurs on the coins of Atrax in Thessaly (circa 400 B.C.). The forceps stands alongside a bleeding cup. The object of the holes in several of the specimens is to permit the insertion of a cord to bind the jaws firmly to- gether, and thus keep up the strangulation of the part for some time, as Aetius directs. The application of a ligature in this way would, of course, not be possible while the instrument was applied to the uvula, but the following passage from Leonidas (Paul, vi. 79) shows that the uvula crusher was also used to clamp piles in the same way: ' Having seized the haemorrhoids and held them there for some time with the uvula crusher (o-Ta<pv\aypq) he cuts them off with a scalpel.' In such a case the application of a cord to clamp the jaws together would be a distinct convenience. The short variety is more suitable for external operations, as for haemorrhoids; the long variety for manipulations in the throat. Hippocrates mentions the uvula crusher as one of the instruments necessary for the outfit of the physician (i. 63). Forceps for applying Caustic to Uvula. Greek, ora^vAoKawnjs. A remarkable variety of forceps, of which there is only one extant specimen (which is in the Vienna Museum) is shown in PL XXXII, fig. 2. It is formed of two branches which cross and are fixed by a rivet near the middle of the instrument. The jaws are 3-5 cm. long, concave internally,

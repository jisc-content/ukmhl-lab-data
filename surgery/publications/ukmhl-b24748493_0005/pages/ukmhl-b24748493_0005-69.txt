CEREBROSPINAL MENINGITIS. 61 history of the epidemic of dengue in Madras in 1872. After touching on the historical part of the subject, he states that the prevalence of the affection was much greater than that of any other epidemic, for many years, in the district of Madras with which he was connected, especially during the months of August, September, and October. The oldest patient was about So years of age, the youngest about two months. Males and females fell ill in about equal numbers; all ranks were alike attacked. The essential symptoms observed in the last epidemic were pyrexia of a continued type and short duration, wry often exhibiting a remittent or intermittent type; pain, swell- ing, and redness of the joints, and in severe cases pain in the muscles and bones; an eruption, not invariably present, resembling several of the exanthematic type, seen mainly on the face, neck, chest, and hands, baving a duration of from 12 to 72 hours, followed always by desqua- mation; and headache, not always present. The sequela? were found to be convulsions in children, and in a few cases in adults; permanent pain, stiffness and swelling of the joints, pericarditis, general paralysis md amaurosis in one case, and amaurosis in two others ; diarrhoea and lysentery, debility, conjunctivitis, derangement of the brain, abortion, [n some few cases there was a relapse after a complete apyretic in- ;erval, extending sometimes to many months. The writer considers ;he period of incubation to be from three to five days. " The exciting lause is a specific contagion propagated by human intercourse." The )aper concludes with some remarks on its diagnosis and treatment.

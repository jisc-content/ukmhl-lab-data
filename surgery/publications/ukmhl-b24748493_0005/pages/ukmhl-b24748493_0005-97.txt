87 VARIOLA— GOITRE—PELLAGRA. four times the normal amount of sulphate of lime, which increase he conceives to be due to a storing up of the salt in the tissues due to over great muscular action. This latter view is opposed by Larrey (ib. 733), who lays stress upon the mechanical effect of neck-stocks, &c, the exposure of the neck to cold while the body is heated, and the use of cold water; to this communication Bergeret makes answer (ib.). F.Garrigou ('G-az. Hebd.,' 1879, 270), after comparing various districts in the Pyrenees in which goitre and cretinism are endemic, concludes that the affection occurs exclusively in regions whose soil contains magnesia, and that the mountain water holds in solution the primary cause of this disease—probably a salt of magnesia in combination with a special organic substance.

The papers lately published on pellagra are but a continuation of the discussion between Gemma, Bellini, Balardini, and Lombroso as to the origin and etiology of this affection. Balardini, from his experi- ments on fowls, had insisted upon diseased maize as its cause; this view is strongly opposed by the first two writers, whom Balardini again answers; while Lombroso, in opposition to both sides, asserts his own theory to be still the right one (cf. last 'Bienn.

ENDOCARDITIS. 161 are the severe general constitutional disturbance, and especially the pyrexia. He has repeatedly found vibrio-like bodies in this affection. E. King gives (' Path. Soc. Trans.,' xxiv, 40) a case of extreme aortic stenosis iu a woman, set. 55. She had had a severe attack of rheumatic fever at the age of 33, followed by another five years later, but had not complained of any cardiac symptoms till half a year before death. The apex of the heart could be felt in the seventh intercostal space, and the area of dulness was greatly increased. There was a loud, coarse, and unusually long systolic murmur everywhere over the pre- cordia, and considerably beyond. The dyspnoea at times was very urgent, 8he had frequent fainting-fits, and died suddenly while sleeping. The pericardium was found to be universally adherent. On slitting open the aorta down to the level of the valves the aortic opening was found to be almost completely occluded by a calcareous mass which was merely perforated near its centre by an orifice barely admitting a Xo. 6 catheter, and so effectually overgrown by vegetations that water would not pass either from the aorta into the ventricle or vice versa without considerable pressure. The walls of the left ventricle, which was dilated, measured ten lines in their thickest part. The mitral and tricuspid valves, though slightly thickened, were compe- tent ; the liver was nutmeg and cirrhotic, the kidneys contracted.

Aufrecht (' Die chronische Broncho-pneuinonie (Lungenschwind- sucbt) und die Granulie, (Tuberculose),' Magdeburg, 1873, pp. <;6) bases his conclusions on 100 autopsies of patients dying of phthisis. In 92 of the chronic cases the lungs were free from tubercles and showed only broncho-pneumonic deposits in the apices. In four cases miliary tubercles were present without any remains of any antecedent local inflammation. In a small number of cases the two forms occurred together. The broncho-pneumonic form consists in a deposition of white blood-corpuscles in the small bronchi and alveoli, frequently with consequent destruction of the exudation and the infiltrated part. The disease commences very often without any symptoms except those of anaemia. Aufrecht does not hold Niemeyer's views on the subject of haemoptysis, though it may be attended with the results described by the latter in a very few cases ; he has observed only two cases of the kind, and looks upon it only as a consequence of an existing broncho- pneumonia ; but he allows that haemoptysis, by the presence of blood in the lower lobes especially, may set up fresh points of broncho-pneu- monia, particularly when the free movement of the lung is prevented by thickened pleura. Of catarrh at the apices he does not make much account, thinking it also a consequence of chronic deposits. On the other hand, a lobar pneumonia of the apex or an attack of catarrhal pneumonia in childhood may be the starting-point of the affection, and in these cases there are certain predisposing causes, hereditary and other. Broncho-pneumonia may end, only in a very few cases, in recovery; generally its course is badâ€”(1) through the eruption of a miliary tuberculosis, to which, following Empis, he gives the name "granulia;" or (2) in the shape of a galloping phthisis, &c, the production of rapidly dying deposits, in a course of one to three months ; or (3) most frequently, by the chronic extension of the process, which may drao- on through a period of forty or fifty years. As to the histological elements found in the tubercle granulation, be agrees to some extent with Klebs

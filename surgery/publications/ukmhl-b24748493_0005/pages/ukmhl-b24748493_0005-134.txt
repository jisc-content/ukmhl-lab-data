M. Roth (' Anatomischer Befund bei Spinaler Kinderlahmung,'' Yirch. Arch.,' lviii, 263) gives the case of a child, aet. 2, who had had partial paralysis of the lower limbs, and died eventually of diphtheria. The para- lysis and wasting were most marked in the right leg, and under the use of electricity there was some improvement in the course of a year. He gives a full description, with a plate, of the pathological changes found. The lumbar enlargement of the cord was but slightly developed, the anterior roots of the cauda equina of a marked grey colour, flattened and atro- phied. On section the anterior grey horns were of a dusky greyish- white colour, and indistinctly marked off from the lateral columns. The ji latter themselves were grey. Sections of the hardened cords showed I the presence of inflammatory matter about the anterior horn for a I length of about 30 mm, through the lumbar region on the right side,

A longitudinal section of the tibia showed that the cartilage was homogeneous, without a trace of bone-nuclei. The shaft had a moderately strong and hard external layer, from which several small compact stripes ran into the spongy substance. The limit of ossification between cartilage and bone was very sharply marked, but the characteristic layers of cartilage-cells along the border of ossification were absent. The small cells found in other parts of the cartilage had more the appearance of connective-tissue-corpuscles, and were further on lost in a layer of fibrous tissue between the cartilage and the bone, which was con- tinuous with the inner layer of the periosteum ; this was thinner in one place than another, and in other spots entirely absent, so that bone and cartilage lay in direct contact; but even in this situation the layers of cartilage-cells were Avanting. The centrum of the shaft showed cretified cartilage with cells like large bladders. The periosteum was normal. The author poiuts out the differences between this case and one of true rickets. P. Bouland (" Recherches anatomiques sur le Rachitisme de la Colonne vertebrale," ' Compt. Bend.,' lxxviii, 564) concludes from measurements he has taken that curvature of the spine is not always due, as is frequently said to be the case, to a relaxed state of the ligaments. His observations were made on children between the ages of two and sixteen months, the majority, though slight, being in the female sex. He thinks that the conditions found in rickets may be referred to three principal types, according as the inter-articular cartilages alone, these and the vertebrae, and both cartilages and vertebrae, together with the ligaments, are involved. Increase in the proliferation of the cartilage-cells is the most marked microscopic appearance. Z. J. Strelzof. "Rachitis," 'Untersuch. aus dein Path. Inst, zu Zurich,' 1872, pp. 52. F.

The symptoms he arranges under three > heads (a) Degeneration of the supra-renal bodies, shown in various j degrees of cheesiness or more or less extensive cretification. (b) } Various pigmentations of the skin and mucous membranes, con- | sisting in a deposit of pigment in the cells of the epidermis, and very i rarely in those of the coriuin.

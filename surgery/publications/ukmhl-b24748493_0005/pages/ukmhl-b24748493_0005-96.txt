Med.,' 1874, 17) writes on an epidemic outbreak of goitre in the garrison of St. Etiennein the summer of 1873, due, he thinks, to insufficient nourishment of the men affected. The officers and non-commissioned officers, who had better food, escaped com- pletely. The utter uselessness of iodine, employed externally and internally, was remarkable, while by far the greater number of cases recovered under rest and improved rations. Bergeret ('Compt. Bend.,' lxxvii, 7.31) writing on this same epidemic, and arriving pretty much at the same conclusion, refers to the view confirmed by observations carried on in Saxon-les-Bains, and in the neighbourhood of St. Leger, that the essential cause of goitre is the presence, to any large extent, of the sulphates of lime and magnesia in the drinking-water. Up to 1835 goitre and cretinism were common among the population of the first locality, but both affections have recentlv diminished, and the children of the present generation present no symptoms of either. The cause of this is to be found in the fact that they have ceased to drink water containing these salts. During the epidemic at St. Etienne, in which 250 cases occurred, he found, on analysing the urine during the affection, an increase to the extent of 1 I have placed these two affections together here simply for the sake of ron- venience.â€”A.

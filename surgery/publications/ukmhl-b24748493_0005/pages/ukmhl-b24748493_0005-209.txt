199 PARASITIC SKIN DISEASES, ETC. habitants of towns: of 100 Parisians 95 presented the latter, and only r the former affection, almost all who did have it coming out of the country. It was generally agreed that favus is rarely transmissible from one human being to another. Horand ('Lyon. Med.,' xiv, 165) showed to the Societe des Sciences Medicales at Lyons a girl, set. 15, who had contracted favus from a cat; it affected the outside of the wrist, the back of the hand, and the clavicular region of the left side, and the upper and anterior portion of the right arm. There seems to have been some difference of opinion as to whether the disease was favus or herpes circinatus, which was settled bv microscopical examination in favour of the former. Another person in the same house exhibited the same eruption; and the source of contagion was traced to a cat of two months old, covered with scabs, which had probably taken it from a cat said to be in the same con- dition. Horand adds another set of cases in which a husband and wife caught favus from a rat. Conche (ib., 489) showed to the same society a rat on which the favus eruption had been " spontaneously developed." Simon ('Arch. f. Derm.,' v, 303) also continues further observa- tions on the occurrence of the same affection in mice.

Pincus (" TJeber plotzliches Ergrauen der Haare," 'Deut. Klin.,' 1873,9) publishes two cases, written down for him at his own request, of sudden change in the colour of the human hair to grey. The first is that of a Dr. M., in Berlin, who had sent his wife and daughter to Salzbrunn, and in the first letter which brought him any news of thern learnt the death of the latter. Only a few hairs kept their original brown colour. The second case was that of a young man, between 30 and 35 years of age, who plunged into the water to save a child, and on bringing it to shore dead recognised it as his own; his hair immediately turned grey and remained so.

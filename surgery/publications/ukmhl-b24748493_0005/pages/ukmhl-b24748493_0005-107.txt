Med. Woch.,' 1873, No. 27) on " The Etiology of Scurvy." He is convinced that it should be classed among the infectious diseases, by the side of intermittent and "tvphus" fevers. Among other grounds he gives for his belief he asserts that the afiection predominates in regions which are well known to be breeding places of the infectious diseases, often occurring simul- taneously with them ; that it repeatedly breaks out after the use of bad meat or water, after living in atmospheres loaded with the products of decomposition, and in circumstances which all stand in direct relation to the progess of putrefaction. Whatever be the specific poison, as yet unknown, its entrance into the system is by the mucous membrane of the respiratory or digestive passages. The question whether scurvy is a primary blood-disease or not cannot be settled on our present grounds of knowledge. H. Molliere (" Eecherches clmiques sur la Nosographie du Purpura hsemorrbagique et des Affections petechiales," ' Lyon Med.,' siv, 331) has collected ten cases, for the most part occurring under his own obser- vation, in which purpura was combined with the most varying conditions, standing in no relation whatever to one another.

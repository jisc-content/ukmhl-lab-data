174 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. (litters only in intensity from, that occurring in chronic dysentery and diarrhoea ; and in a second paper (" Contribution u l'Anatomie patho- logique de la Dysenterie Aiguij," ib., 687) he thinks that this opinion is confirmed by the autopsy of a soldier who died on the twenty-third day of acute dysentery. The mucous membrane in this case was almost everywhere destroyed. What remained showed as dark red islets, only partially adherent to the subjacent tissue. These islets consisted of Lieberkiihn's tubes, irregularly disposed, atrophied, dilated, and pressed upon by the intermediate fibro-vascular tissue. The network of blood- vessels between the tubes was immensely developed, and all its branches, large and small, gorged with red and white blood-cells. Alongside of the blood-vessels were large collections of pus-cells. Kelsch found no trace of the closed follicles, and concludes that they suppurate together with the layer of tissue in which they lie. He holds that the morbid process commences in this layer (vascular zone of Dollinger), and that the changes in the mucous membrane (epithelium and crypts of Lieberkiihn) are secondary, and he thus easily accounts for the desquamation of the mucous membrane, which is the fundamental anatomical characteristic of acute dysentery. The paper concludes with some remarks on the condition of the ileum in acute and chronic dysentery, the nephritis said to occur in the disease, and on the stools. Both papers are accompanied by excellent illustrations. B. Wenzel (" Zur Behandlung der Ruhr," ' Berl. Klin. Woch.,' 1873, 57 5) uses injections of ice-water in all recent and acute cases of dysentery, whether their character be slight or severe ; in bad cases he employs them every two hours. He seldom finds it necessary to give opium. In old and recurring cases of chronic dysentery this plan of treatment fails. Amelung ('Zur Behandlung der Dysenterie,' ib., 125) obtains great success from carbolic acid, which he continues every two hours till the bloody and slimy character of the stools disappears, and they become more natural. 1 Cersoy, " Considerations pratiques sur la Dysenterie aigue," 'Bull.

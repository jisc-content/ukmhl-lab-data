Inoculability of Tubercle. Rindfleisch is reported at length (' Berl. Klin. Woch.,' 1873, 68, 81) on the subject of tuberculous inflammation. After stating that the results of experiments on animals, by proving that cheesy masses of any sort can set up miliary tubercle, so far take away from the latter its specific character, and degrade it to a product akin to connective tissue, he lays down that there is a special form of inflammation which goes on to caseation—the specific product of a constitutional diathesis. It is characterised histologically by the formation of more or less cir- cumscribed infiltrations of connective tissue, the microscopical appear- ances of which he describes minutely. The symptoms of this tubercu- lous inflammation he classifies as, 1, primary affections of various organs with the character of phthisis or ulceration. 2. Secondary affections, through local infection ; miliary tubercles of the lymphatic system and connective tissue, with scrofulous tumours of the lymph- glands. 3. Tertiary affections—infection of the entire organism : miliary tuberculosis of the different organs, developed pre-eminently in the small vessels. Fatal cachexia and hereditary diathesis depend upon the absorption of the softened cheesy masses, the diathesis ex- hibiting itself as a reproduction of vascular tubercles or as scrofulosis. He sketches the process as it occurs in the lungs, where it commences as a tuberculous infiltration of the wall of the small intra-lobular branches of the bronchi. O.Bollinger ('Arch. f. Exp. Path. u. Pharm.,'i, 356) has made three series of experiments on 10 carnivorous animals (7 dogs and 3 cats), and 9 herbivorous (7 goats and 2 sheep). In the first series he made

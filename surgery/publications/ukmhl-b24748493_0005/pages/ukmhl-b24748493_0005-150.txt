140 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. pericardium. The right lung was completely carnified and pushed up against the vertebral column. Nothing is said about any opening I between the lung and the pleura. It. Nelson records ('Lancet,' 1873, i, 767) an interesting case of rupture of the lung with hajmothorax. A gunner, set. 40, was engaged in digging a trench when he was suddenly buried by a mass of loose gravel. The most marked symptoms during life were intensely loud bronchial rales, great dyspnoea, and after a few days complete dulness, with absence of respiratory murmur, over the whole right side. The patient died on the tenth day. There was no external wound or ecchy- mosis of the chest-walls; the right pleural cavity contained twenty- five ounces of dark fluid blood ; the right lung was one fourth its normal size, firm in consistence, and contained only a small quantity of air. A transverse rent about i\ inch long, extended through the pleura pulmonalis and for a short distance into the substance of the lung on the external surface of the middle lobe. The costal pleura was un- injured, and there was no fracture of the ribs. The left lung was emphysematous in a most marked degree, the air-vesicles in its upper third being ruptured and formed into cavities as large as a hazel-nut. The bronchial tubes showed signs of subacute inflammation, and were choked with frothy mucus. The surface of the heart was coated with a recent deposit of lymph. The other organs were healthy. Under the heading of " albuminous expectoration " (' De l'Expectora- tion albumineuse apres la Thoracenteses Paris, 1873, pp. 85), Terillon has collected 21 cases in which, as is not uncommon, paracentesis of the chest wall and the sudden removal of the effusion was followed by acute serous effusion into the alveoli of the lung. Two of his cases died from oedema of the lung. He found this " albuminous expec- toration " to occur from ten minutes to half an hour after the operation. A discussion as to the cause of the phenomenon is continued by writers, references to whose papers are to be found in the biblio- graphy below. Numerous papers in addition on the same subject may be found in the 'Union Medicale' (vols, xv, xvi, &c. See also review of the subject, ' Gaz. des Hop.,' 1873, 377).

178 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. case of a woman, set. 59, in whom during life the liver dulness was entirely absent. She had also ovarian tumour and ascites. After repeated paracentesis she died, and the liver was found to be reduced to half its size and dragged upwards and backwards. A tumour which had been supposed to be the liver was found to consist of the greatly thickened omentum. Leopold ('Arch. f. G-ynakol.,' 1874, vii) gives a similar case, said to be the seventh recorded of " descensus hepatis." This occurred also in a woman, a>t. 54, in whom the thinness of the abdominal walls helped to make the diagnosis clear. "Report, &c, of Autopsy of the Siamese Twins" (with woodcuts), 'Brit.

Affections of the Spleen. W. Mosler (' Virch. Arch.,' lvii, 1) writes on the action of cold water on the spleen. He gives a sketch of the literature on the sub- ject, commencing with Currie (' Medical Reports on the Effects of Water, Cold and Warm,' London, 1805), and adds the results of his own experiments on animals and the history of five clinical cases. He concludes that applications of cold water to the abdomen cause a marked decrease in the size of the spleen, not only in its normal con- dition, but also in chronic and acute enlargements of the organ, whether recent or of some standing. He points out that in addition to having the same advantages as quinine in this manner, it has disadvantages in chilling the body, &c. He recommends that the use of cold water, whether as baths, ice bladders, or the cold douche, should be combined with quinine, the combination of the two having a better effect than the use of either separately. In chronic cases of enlargement he uses chinoidine, as cheaper. C. C. Eitchie records (' Lancet,' 1873, ii, 6) the case of a boy, vet. i\, of rickety habit, in the left side of whose abdomen a swelling had been noticed at the age of fourteen months. On examination a solid tumour, somewhat globular in shape, uniform on the surface, and with a diameter of <\ by 4! inches, could be distinctly felt occupying the left hypochondriac, umbilical, and left iliac regions. It did not move with respiration or palpation, but during deep inspiration a dis- tinctly rounded edge could be made out. The urine contained alhumen and blood-casts.

SYPHILIS—PARASITES. 105 G. G. Gascoyen, "Vacciuo-Syphilis," 'Lancet,' 1873,1,219. Robinson, on same, ib. ib., i, 321. Fox, " Alleged Vaccinal Syphilis," ib. ib., ii, 659. Animal Parasites. C. W. F. Udhe gives further tables of the number of swine killed in the principality of Brunswick, and those found to be affected with trichina?. From Easter 1869 to 1871 (' Virch. Arch.,' lvii, 528), 12 out of 183,543 were found to contain these parasites, i.e. 1 in 15,295; between Easter 1871 and 1872 (ib., lviii, 325), 7 out of 93,707 were so affected; and between Easter 1872 and 1873, 19 out of 92,605 (ib., lix, 160). A. Petri (ib., lvii, 296) also gives another table of all (6^^) the swine killed at Rostock during 1872. Trichinae were found in none. He remarks that of 622 sides of bacon imported thither from America 11 contained the pai-asites. Of 5836 killed during 1873, in the same place (ib.. lix, 538), 3 only were infested by trichina?. In the ' Fourth Annual Report of the Board of Health of Massa- chusetts ' (1873), p. 454, is an account of the occurrence of trichina disease in a family in Framingham, in that state, in December, 1872. The sausages (made from a pig, raised with care by the owner) had been frozen, and were very slightly cooked, so that the heat had not penetrated the inner parts. The owner, his wife, and a son of fifteen, after eating them, were all affected with swelling of the eyelids, fol- lowed by swelling of the whole face, and, a few days later, swelling of the legs and feet, violent pains in the legs, arms, shoulders, and back, and, in the case of the first patient, diarrhoea. Specimens of the salted, nnsmoked ham were found to contain very numerous unencapsuled trichina?. Three cases in which symptoms of trichiniasis occurred after eating half-cooked pork are given in the fifth annual report of the same board (p. 523). Klob ('London Med. Rec.,' 1874, 444) found the muscles of a man a?t. 73 crammed with trichina?, most of them in the calcified condition. The patient had died from marasmus. Knoch ('Virch. Arch.,' lix, 528) relates the occurrence of trichina? in a family of seven persons in St. Petersburg. The ham and sausages of which they had eaten gave no decided results on examination, but portions of muscle taken from the arm of one of the sufferers showed the parasites already encapsuled. S. Coupland showed (' Path. Soc. Trans.,' xxv, 262) specimens of muscles from a case of trichiniasis. The patient, a man, ast. 23, had been admitted into hospital for bronchitis and phthisis, of which he died in a fortnight. All the voluntary muscles, even those of the eje- ball and the tensor tympani, were most thickly crowded with encysted trichina?, the cysts being all calcified. One grain in weight of a muscle of the thigh was found to contain 180 of the cysts. It is most pro- bable that the man contracted the disease nine years before, in New York, as during his stay there for eighteen months he had an attack of "enteric fever," of which he almost died. C. Weatphal ('Berl. Klin. Woch.,' 1873, 205) records the follow- ing:—A boy, aged 17, waa attacked, at the end of May, 1872, with

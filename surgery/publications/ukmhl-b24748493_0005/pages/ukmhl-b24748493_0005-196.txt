Arch.,' xii, 326) has remarked in cases of jaundice, arising from various causes, whether accompanied or not by fever, the occurrence of casts in the urine, in greater or less number, and apparently in direct proportion to the intensity of the jaundice. These casts were generally hyaline, carry- ing formed elements or nuclei, and sometimes covered with epithelial cells of a yellowish tinge. The occurrence of so-called fibrinous casts was exceptional, nor were red blood-cells or albumen found in the urine. Gr. Johnson ('Lancet,' 1873, ii, 812) has noticed a temporary al- buminuria, without casts, in healthy persons, after prolonged cold bathing. H. Eichorst (' Bcrl. Klin.

REPORT ON PHYSIOLOGY. brata. The endoderm has in all metazoaries the same anatomical value. For the study of the origin of the essential organs of generation M. v. Beneden selected zoophytes, in which animals the ectoderm and endoderm persist almost unaltered throughout the whole course of evolution. He finds that the ova in Hydractinia and Clavaare only the modified cells of the endoderm, which the testis develops at the expense of a cellular bud which proceeds from the inner face of the ectoderm. The male organ arises from the nervous or animal layer ; the female organ pro- ceeds from the intestinal or vegetative layer, and fecundation consists in a simple mixture of ectodermic elements with a product of the endo- derm. Moreover M. v. Beneden has shown that every sporosac origin- ally contains within itself the rudiments of an ovary and of a testis; and if this observation be associated with the researches of Waldeyer on the Vertebrata and the established fact that all animals possess an endoderm and an ectoderm, the conclusion is forced upon us that every animal is primarily hermaphrodite. In accordance, however, with the development of one or the other, the testis or ovary remains in a rudi- mentary condition. Histology. Various papers have been written upon the histology of the different tissues. Amongst the more important are those of Lowe1 on the struc- ture of the connective tissue, who finds that all fissures and lacunae in the connective tissues are serous cavities. Spina 2 and Ditlevsen 3 on the structure of tendons, Deutschmann 4 and Hertwig5 have written on the development of elastic fibres in reticular cartilage. Deutschmann considers that they are developed from the cartilage cells as a whole, including both the capsule and the contained protoplasm. They first appear as very fine stria? which gradually increase in size. This seems to be the view of Hertwig also. Cartilage. Hitzmann5 gives an account of the cellular elements of bone and of the structure of hyaline cartilage with the changes occurring in them in inflammation. See also Ch. Bobin's6 ' Observations comparatives sur la moelle des os.' Kolliker 8 describes the mode in which Howship's lacuna? and absorp- tion cavities are formed in bone, and is of opinion that they result from the action of certain large protoplasmic cells, termed osteoclasts, which possess several nuclei, and are probably the descendants of the proper bone-forming cells or osteoblasts.

519 BREAD. M. Dubrunfaut1 also proposes to make rancid animal fats, such as suet, dripping, &c, edible by depriving them of their odour. This may be done by raising them to a temperature of 2840—3020 Fahr., and intro- ducing small quantities of water, which during its conversion into vapour deprives the fat of all unpleasant odour. Animal fats deprived of their peculiar and characteristic odours are not unknown in English commerce, and are sold as butterine, &c. Bread.—Drs. H. Eulenburg and H. Yohl3 draw attention to tho adulterations practised on the Continent upon bread by mixing it, not only with alum, as was until lately the custom in this country, but also with copper sulphate (blue vitriol) and zinc sulphate (white vitriol). In bread purchased in Holland the ash amounted to so much as a-oi, 5*36, and 4*69 per cent., whereas pure bread was found to contain only 1 "07 to 1*5 per cent, of ash. This indicates a large amount of mineral adulteration. The ash was found to contain aluminium in some cases, in others copper, and in others, again, zinc. Such breads would not pro- duce the ordinary symptoms of poisoning by salts of the respective metals, but would cause digestive troubles. Happily the public analysts in this country, appointed under the statute of 1872, have been able to detect in English bread no worse ingredient than alum, which during the process of baking is decomposed into insoluble aluminium phosphate and an alkaline sulphate. 1 Ibid., loc. cit. 2 'Archiv der Pharm./ quoted in 'Ann. d'Hyg.,' xl, p. 225.

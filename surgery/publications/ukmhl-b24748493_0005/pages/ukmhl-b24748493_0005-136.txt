Gafl'ky (' Ueber den ursiichlichen Zusammenhang zwischen chronischer Blei-intoxication und Nierenaffectionen,' Berlin, 1873, pp. 30), publishes a case of lead colic occurring in a woman employed in a paper factory, whose business it was to stamp paper patterns with a lead hammer. She suffered from albuminuria, which disappeared on an attack of colic, and from this fact he attempts to show that in chronic lead-poisoning there is some change in the vaso-motor nerves of the abdomen, especially in the fibres of the sympathetic of the splanchnic nerve, by means of which an albuminuria saturnina may be caused. He gives two other cases in which, in the course of chronic lead- poisoning, nephritis occurred without any appreciable cause, and in- clines to the opinion that the former affection may be a predisposing cause of the latter. M. Leidersdorf ('Wien. Med. Ztng.,' 1873, 561) records a case in which the same question finds a different illustration. A house- painter's assistant, a year previous to his death, had suffered from lead-colic. During life his urine was free from albumen, and though death occurred from convulsions and coma, his kidneys were found to be perfectly healthy, putting deatli from uramiia out of the question; in addition there was anaemia and oedema of the brain, without any change in its tissue or in the meninges. Lead was found in small quantities in the urine and the brain-substance. Troisier and Lagrange (' Gaz. Med.,' 1784, 62) give the history and microscopical examination of the brain, half the spinal cord, and the liver, of a tinman, set. 46. The substance used by him in his work consisted of four parts tin and one part lead. He gave up work a year before his death, which occurred through some organic affection of the stomach, and during that time presented no symptoms of lead-poison- ing, though a lead gum-line was visible to the last. The organs named were examined as described in the text; the brain contained a mo- derate quantity of lead, the liver only traces, and the cord, so far as it could be recognised, none. O. Berger ("Ein Beitrag zur Lehre von der Encephalopathia satur- nina," ' Berl. Klin. Woch.,' 1874, 122) gives the case of the wife of a

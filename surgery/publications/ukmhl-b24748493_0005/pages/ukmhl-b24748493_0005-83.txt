Enteric (Typhoid) Fever.1 Alix (" Note sur les typhiques observes aLongwy," ' Gaz. des Hop.,' 1873,505) is bold enough to affirm, judging from his observations made among the French troops at Longwy during the late Franco-German war, that typhoid and typhus are identical, and only varying grades of one and the same disease. B. Rath (' Beitrag zu Aetiologie der Berliner Typhus-Epidemie im Jahre, 1872,' Berlin, 1873, pp. 31), in an account of the epidemic of typhoid at Berlin in 1872, which was fatal in 1214 cases, the popula- tion numbering about 800,000 persons, and the whole mortality being 28,191, shows that when the soil-water stood at its highest the mor- tality from typhoid was least, the disease being most fatal when the former was at its lowest level. This agrees with what had been ob- served before. At the same time he does not think that the increase in the epidemic, especially the increased mortality in the autumn, is to be referred entirely to the emanations from the low-standing soil- water ; it is more probable that an infected water-supply had a large 8hare in its extension. F. Kiiehenmeister ('Zeitsch. f. Epidem.,' 1874, i, 1) describes a small epidemic of typhoid in 1872-3 in Rheinhardtsdorf, a town on the left bank of the Elbe, in Saxon Switzerland. It was confined to houses whose water supply passed through the sewage of a house in which the first case, probably introduced from without, appeared. 1 The liteTatnre on this subject for the last two years is so extensive, ns the sub- joined bibliography shows, that I have been compelled to omit abstracts of papers by English writers, and place them all withotit exception among the references, as they are more easily referred to than foreign papers.—A.

The child was born at the full time, and the parents noticed in it later a weakness of the right side, loss of power in the right hand, and dragging of the right leg, which was shorter than the left. The child could not speak, or only produced a few indistinct words with difficulty, but its intelligence and hearing were perfect, so that it was not in the condition of the deaf and dumb. When it cried its voice was loud and clear. Examination of the mouth and larynx showed only some abnormal length of the framum linguae and slight paresis of the palate. The writer looks upon the affection here as one entirely due to an intra-uteriue origin and congenital, and remarks that this case does not agree with the view that the central organ of speech is situated in both sides of the brain, though most developed on the left side; if that were so, this child, whose left brain was affected, ought to have learned to speak so far as the right was concerned, but such was not the case.

General papers on Pulmonary Pathology. H. Nothnagel (' Centralbl.,' 1874, 209) has produced results analo- gous to those obtained by Brown-Sequard (see last • Report,' 108). After injuring, even with a needle, a certain point on the upper sur- face of the brain in rabbits, he finds, as a special change among several others, haemorrhages in the lungs, sometimes so intense that the whole lung-tissue is almost filled with blood. Jehn (ib., 340) refers, in connection with the above paper, to the extensive exudations of blood into the alveoli in lunatics, which appear to be due to diapedesis. In five autopsies (one case of melancholia, one of mania, three of paralysis) there were found in both lungs extrava- sations of bright red, apparently purely arterial blood, some dissemi- nated, others covering large portions, and in one case, with the exception of a few normal islets, universal. Portions of the affected parts floated beneath water. The bronchi were free. The microscope showed the alveoli almost completely filled with red blood-corpuscles. There were no changes in the vessels or the lung-tissue itself. The brain in these cases showed sometimes no change, in others old and recent mening- itis, diffused redness of several convolutions, and in two cases capillary apoplexies of the cortical substance. During life there were no sym- ptoms of any affection of the lungs. A. Ollivier ("De l'Apoplexie pulmonairc unilateral dans sesrapports avoc l'Hcmorrhagie cerebrale," 'Arch. Gen.,'xxii, 167) gives three

127 LEAD-POISONING, ETC. master-potter, aged 43. For years she bad suffered from unilateral headache; she had aborted five times, had lost five children in infancy, and had had lead-colic four times. Her family, all engaged in pottery, were exposed to tho vapours of lead, and almost all had at one time or other bad symptoms of lead-poisoning, accompanied by cerebral disturbance of some kind or otber (apoplexy, hemiplegia, &c). The patient berself had hemiplegia, due, probably, to rupture of some cerebral vessel; and the writer thinks that a congenital tendency to brain mischief was combined here with a special affection of the brain arteries set up by the lead, to produce this rupture. Some papers are included in the bibliography below with reference to the manner in which lead finds its way into drinking-water. Elgnowski, ' Zur Casuistik der Bleilakinungen,' Berlin, 1873, pp. 32.

A fortnight later she presented marked redness of the left half of the face, neck, and chest, accompanied with dimness of vision, loss of memory, difficulty of speech, &c. All the symptoms, which the writer refers to an affection of the left sympathetic, disappeared under the employment of elec- tricity. A. Eulenburg ('Berlin. Ellin. "Woch.,' 1873, 169) records two cases in which he traces the symptoms to an affection of the same nerves. The first is that of a young man, set. 26, who suffered from mydriasis and imperfect accommodation of the left eye, with periodic pains in the left forehead, accompanied by coldness and decreased temperature of the left ear as compared with the right. The glands on the inner border of the left sterno-cleido-mastoid were swollen, and probably pressed on the first cervical ganglion. The second case, that

SYPHILIS. 103 tion, and for the hardness of its hase and edges. The cases in which no mercury was given show that it may last for some months before it heals. After healing it leaves a dusky brown scar, very different from that of vaccination. The paper concludes with remarks as to its treatment, and warning to the vaccinator as to his choice of vacci- nifers. T. Bryant gives ('Med. Times and Gaz.,' 1874, i, 476) two cases illustrating the occurrence in children of syphilis inherited from the fathers, the mothers not being affected. Giinzburg ('Wien. Med. Woch.,' 1873, No. 19) discusses the mor- tality of artificially fed syphilitic children, and the frequency of infection on the part of dry nurses, as compared with that on the part of mothers who suckle their own syphilitic offspring. O.Bollinger ('Virch. Arch.,' lix, 341) has noticed in hares certain nodules of various size seated chiefly in the genital organs, which he thinks are due to syphilis. Microscopically they consist of a fatty debris in the centre, with round and giant cells in a reticulum at their circumference. E. Bassereau, ' Origine de la Syphilis,' Paris, 1873, pp. 49. A.

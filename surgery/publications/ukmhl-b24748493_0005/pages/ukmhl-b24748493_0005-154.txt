144 ItEPOItT ON PflACTICAL MEDICIKE. Cornil writes ('Gaz. MeM.,' 1873, 185) on changes in the elastic fibres of the lung. The patient was a youth, ait. 18, who died Avith symptoms of gummata of the skull and dura mater, and had gummata of the sternum and broncho-pneumonia. A large portion of the upper and some part of the lower lobe of the left lung were indu- rated, without being completely hepatized. There were nowhere any tubercles or cheesy deposits. On section these portions of lung had the character of advanced lobar catarrhal pneumonia. Microscopic exami- nation in the fresh state showed that most of the alveoli were filled with an exudation composed of pus-corpuscles and more or less granular epithelial cells. The bundles of elastic fibres were thick, rigid, and easily broken. Sections of the hardened lung-tissue only served to prove that the lesion of the fibres, characterised by their swollen appear- ance, their altered refraction, their hardness and friability, coincided in this case with a retrogressive period of the catarrhal pneumonia and a partial atrophy of the capillary vessels.

Orth (" Zur Kenntniss der braunen Induration der Lunge," ' Virch. Arch.,' lviii, 126) found in a case which presented the so- called brown induration of the lungs after mitral insufficiency, that the capillaries, and even vessels of a larger calibre, were filled with the same more or less brown pigment. It occurred in the interstitial tissue and in the cavities of several alveoli, within large nucleated cells (lung-epithelium). Injection of a pulmonary artery did not pass into several of these pigment-containing vessels, whether in the lung- tissue or in the capillary loops of the alveoli. The pigment itself ex- isted partly as amorphous granules and flakes, partly as roundish bodies, which on the addition of potash swelled up, took on a yellowish colour, and looked like altered blood-cells. As in some sort compensating for the hindrance to the circulation caused by this plugging, were found long unbranching vessels, which seemed to occupy by preference spots in which a large number of capillaries had been rendered impervious, partly in the larger septa, partly in the walls of the alveoli. The con- dition described supports the older view, according to which, besides

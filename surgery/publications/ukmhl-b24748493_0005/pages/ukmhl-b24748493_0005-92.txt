The gums, buccal mucous membrane, and hard palate, are not affected in scarlet fever; the lips become red and fis- sured in severe cases ; the nose also is generally unaffected (in opposition to what occurs in measles). The larynx, in some rare cases, may be the seat of a primary affection (croup, diphtheria). L.

Woch.,' 1873, 59,3) several cases of ne- phritis after scarlet fever. In the first there was oedema without the presence of albumen or casts in the urine. Three days later the child had an uraemic attack, and his urine, withdrawn by a catheter, was loaded with albumen and granular casts. The autopsy showed intense parenchymatous nephritis. The second case, a child, set. 6, had a slight attack of scarlet fever, and a fortnight later had oedema of the face, scanty urine, with abundant albumen, blood-cells, and " lymph-cor- puscles." Gradually the urine became normal, but a few days later again became largely albuminous. Henoch noticed in the case of three children that their urine, which contained only traces of albumen, became loaded with it after fits of temper and crying; and in another child that after a purgative the urine in the morning was free from albumen, though it contained a certain amount of it in the evening. He found parenchymatous nephritis post mortem in a case in which no albumen had been found during life. He puts the question whether under these circumstances there occurs a nephritis without albuminous urine, or dropsy without nephritis ; and remarks that partial oedema, especially of the feet, may be only a symptom of debility, without nephritis. In one of his cases there was a suppression of urine for seven days, when the patient died from an uraemic attack. He looks upon the following as tolerably certain appearances to be found in autopsies of scarlet fever cases:â€”Broncho-pneumonia; fatty degene- ration, especially of the right heart; fatty liver; and swelling of the intestinal follicles and the lymphatic glands.

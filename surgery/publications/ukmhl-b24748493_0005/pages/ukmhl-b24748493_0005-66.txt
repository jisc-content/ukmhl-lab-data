56 REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. depths, some entirely superficial; their margins were slightly under- mined ; the skin in their neighbourhood was swollen and pigmented, and several small hard knots were found in the subcutaneous tissue beneath them. On microscopical examination the papilla) of the skin surrounding them were enlarged, their vessels dilated, and the con- nective-tissue cells pigmented. Numerous wandering-cells were seen in the walls of the vessels and the sweat-glands. Numerous small tubercles were found in the bases and margins of the ulcers and in the skin surrounding them. They were made up of giant-cells, with numerous processes, nuclei and epithelioid cells. In some places these cutaneous tubercles seemed to lie close under the epidermis. The small subcutaneous knots mentioned above gave the same appearances, as did also an examination of the inguinal glands, the luugs, and intes- tines. After referring to another case, in which he found the same giant-cells in the skin of a woman, aet. 50, with well-marked sequela? of syphilis and tuberculosis of the apices of the lungs, the writer thinks it probable that scrofulous ulcerations of the skin are due very often to tuberculosis.

REPORT ON PHYSIOLOGY. 12 Popoff,1 Orth,2 Hiller,3 Schafer,4 Martini,5 Billroth," Heiberg,? and Paschutin.8 Mr. A. H. Garrod9 finds that the length of the cardio-sy stole, or interval between the commencement of the systole and the closure of the aortic valve in each cardiac revolution, is constant for any given pulse rate, and that it varies as the square root of the length of the pulse beat only. He finds, also, from the sphygmographic trace at the wrist, that the length of the sphygmo-systole, or interval between the opening and closing of the aortic valve in each cardiac revolution, is constant for any given pulse rate, but varies as the cube root of the length of the pulse beat. By measurements of sphygmograph tracings from the carotid in the neck and the posterior tibial at the ankle Mr. Garrod shows that the length of the sphygmo-systole in those arteries is exactly the same as in the radial. The period occupied by the ventricle in elevating the pressure of the blood in its interior to that of the blood in the aorta, which may be calculated from the above, he terms the " syspasis." Its length is found to be constant for any given pulse rate, but to decrease very rapidly with increase in rapidity of the heart's action, becoming nil when that reaches 170 per minute. Mr. Garrod describes a double sphygmograph for taking simultaneous ti'acings of two distinct vessels, as the radial and posterior tibial. The results of experiments made with this instrument show that there is an appreciable acceleration of the movement of the pulse wave as it gets farther from the heart. Dr. Galabin,10 after commenting on the variety of opinion that exists in reference to the cause of the several waves that appear in sphygmographic tracings, proceeds to describe the two secondary waves seen in the descending stroke. The first of these he terms, with Mohamed, the tidal wave; the second, the dicrotic wave. The first he regards as the result of the inertia of the instrument, the second he refers to the inertia of the arterial walls.

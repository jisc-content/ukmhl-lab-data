REPORT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. by THOMAS STEVENSON, M.D. Lond., F.E.C.P., LECTUEEH. ON CHEMISTEY AT GUY'S HOSPITAL; MEDICAL OFFICEE OF 11EALTU FOB ST. FANCEAS. Mortality Statistics. H. Eulenberg1 contributes some valuable observations on statistics of mortality which are well worthy of perusal by those interested in the subject. He proposes a form of death certificate to be signed by the medical attendant which will, we fear, however valuable it might prove, not be speedily adopted in this country. We need only say that it occupies more than an octavo page, and includes twelve questions, many of them embracing several heads. Sanitary State of Paris and Metz during the Siege of 1870â€”71. M. Bouchardat2 furnishes a paper on this topic. He had the advantage of himself witnessing the siege of Paris, and his son that of the siege of Metz. The details with regard to Metz are very meagre, whilst those relating to Paris are full. In Metz the deaths among the civil population rose steadily from 43 in the week ending August a8th, 1871, to 166 in the week ending October 30th. In the succeeding week they fell to 34, the average number of deaths during the preceding eleven weeks of the siege having been 101 per week. We exclude for obvious reasons the deaths among the military. Barracks and Permanent Camps. Dr. Angel Marvaud 3 contributes an exhaustive essay on barracks aud permanent camps, and their hygienic arrangements, embodying much of the experience gained in the late war and in the siege of Paris.

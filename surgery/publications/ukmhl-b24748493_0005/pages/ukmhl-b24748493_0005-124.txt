The medullary substance of the brain was thickly- studded with minute spots of miliary sclerosis. There were also less numerous semi-transparent bodies, which, unlike the former, took the carmine dye. The minute vessels of the brain were largely dilated and contained blood-globules. The spaces round them contained in many parts blood-crystals. W. Hannes, * Ein Beitrag zur Lelire von der Aphasie' (two cases in men, ast. 50 and 41, recovery), Breslau, 1873, pp. 33. C.

11 BLOOD.—CIRCULATION. demonstrates that normal arterial blood does not contain as much oxygen as it can take up. The blood of the carotid of a dog contains l6*3 per cent, of 0 ; if the animal be made to breathe oxygen the propor- tion rises to 23 "3 per cent., whilst blood saturated with oxygen by agitation contains 26-8 per cent. See also Haro1 and P. Bert.2 Nedsvetski3 has observed very minute spherical bodies in the blood, capable of execut- ing movements of locomotion and of undergoing changes in their form. He has named them hsBmocoeci. M. Eouget4 has given a very full account of the development and structure of the blood- and lymph- capillaries. His observations have been made upon the larvae of various species of batrachians under the influence of woorara, and on the embryonic structures of the sheep, rabbit, dog, and cat. He found that solid protoplasmic processes are thrust forth from pre- viously existing blood-vessels and lymphatics. The points of adjoin- ing processes meet and fuse, and thus form the rudiment of a new capillary, which, by continuous growth, elongates, but still remains impermeable. After a time vacuolar form in the process, and it thus becomes hollow. The young capillaries in the batrachian larva soon acquire a perforated sheath, composed of pigmented cells, the cells being, in fact, modified white corpuscles charged with pigment, which have wandered out of the vessel, and have, so to speak, settled down like parasites upon the vascular wall, because they there find a plentiful supply of food.

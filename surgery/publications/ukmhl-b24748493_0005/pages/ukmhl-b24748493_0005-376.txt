REPORT ON OPHTHALMOLOGY. both from the discharge of cases considered to be cured, and from the admission of fresh cases or of relapsed cases which had been discharged too soon. I have taken as data for comparison the proportion of child- ren at different dates who were quite free from discharge in their eyes, and the proportion who had the largest quantity of discharge these being headed the ' worst' cases. The first uniform and complete record of these particulars was made on the 4th August, 1873, the establishment having been in working order about eleven weeks • the last was made on the 20th April, 1874. I quote only a part of them. Bow Branch Ophthalmic School. Date. Total number of children under care. Quite free from discharge. Worst cases. (Cases with most discharge.) Number. Per cent, of total.

A large number of relapses took place, of which the following numbers give an imperfect record : 1874. January 24 | 218 51 23 1 G. [ 28 The per-centage of ' worst' cases was therefore doubled, and the proportion of mildest cases decreased by one third. Treatment was now resumed and kept up till the end. 1874.

It should be added that the character of the cases marked * worst' was as a whole milder towards the end of the term than at the earlier dates in 1873. Almost all the 'worst' cases on 20th April were extremely chronic and rebellious to treatment. A good deal has been said and written in various quarters about the amount of success which has attended the Bow scheme. I shall, perhaps, not be passing beyond the limits of my subject in giving a short additional statement of my view of the matter, with the intention of reconciling certain apparently conflicting facts. The Bow Branch School was eminently successful in proving that Mr. Critchett's suggestion was a practicable one, and that a large number of children suffering from such a degree of ophthalmia as to need isolation, and in most cases local medical treatment, can by such treat- ment, combined with dietetic and other hygienic improvements, be kept as a rule practically well, and able to go through very nearly the same amount and kind ef education as healthy children. It also had the positive result of keeping up to a large extent the normal educatioual course of a number of children, who but for this plan would have been subject to the usual infirmary life of these schools with its many evils.

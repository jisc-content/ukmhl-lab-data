S., i. 126) on chronic interstitial hepatitis with hypertrophy, insisting that in some cases, certainly rare, we have to deal, not with a transitory period of hyper- trophy, but with a special affection. Among other facts he has noticed a dilatation of the capillaries in a large number of the liver-lobules. The history of several cases, with autoj)sies and plates, is given. V. Cornil (" Note pour servir a l'histoire anatomique de la Cirrhose hepatique," ib., 265) has also found the same dilatation of the capillaries iD connection with dilated interlobular vessels, in this affection, to such an extent sometimes as to form a true cavernous tissue. The capillary walls were greatly thickened, the liver-cells atrophied. (See also ' Gaz. Med.,' 1873, No. 49, and 'Bull, de l'Acad. de Med.,' 1873, No. 44.) J. \V. Legg, writing ('St. Barth. Hosp. Eep.,' viii, 74) on the pa- thology of cirrhosis, states that the nuclei of the connective tissue intervening between the islets of liver tissue are (1) irregular, (2) linear, and (3) clustered together. The cells are one fourth of the natural size, oblong, spindle-shaped, oval, or ovate. He believes that the liver-cells themaelveB take part in the general formation of con-

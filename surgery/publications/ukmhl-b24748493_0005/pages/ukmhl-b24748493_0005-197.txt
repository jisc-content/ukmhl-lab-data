187 KIDNEY-AFFECTIONS; URINE, &C. a man suffering from granular kidney, found for six days an abundant sediment, composed almost entirely of hyaline casts, with others more or less granular, of very unusual size. Most were one line, several even two lines, long, of the thickness of a scalp-hair. Some showed a double contour or were split into two arms. They were coloured yellow by iodine, destroyed rapidly by alkalies'and nitric acid, and very slowly by acetic and hydrochloric acids, while a weak solution (i to 4) of sul- phuric acid had no effect upon them. The quantity of casts gradually decreased, and lymph-cells and epithelial cells in large numbers replaced them. C. H. Ealfe draws ('Lancet,' 1873, i, 87a) the following conclusions from his observations as to the amount of blood diffused in urine in hematuria:—1. That a smoky brown colour is imparted to urine when blood is present in quantities of 1 part in from 1600 to 400. That a cherry red colour is given when 1 part in 350 to 200 is present. That a dull maroon red is given when 1 part in 150 to 100 is present. In more concentrated solutions the colour assumes a deep chocolate brown. 2. That the quantity of blood which gives to urine these distinct colours is much less than has been hitherto supposed. Drawings are given in the ' Lancet' (1873, i, 56) of the haomatozoon found by T. R. Lewis in chylous urine and in the blood of persons suf- fering from chyluria in Calcutta. One of the patients, a woman about 35 year3 of age, of pure English parentage, had laboured under chyl- uria for sixteen years, with occasional periods of apparent cure. ILematozoa were present in blood taken from all parts of the body and i in the urine. She died from diarrhoea, and after death numerous hcernatozoa were found in the renal artery, renal veins, and every part of the kidney. Though this parasite has been found in from fifteen to • twenty persons affected with chyluria, and no case has occurred in ' which it has been absent, Lewis does not refer all cases of chyluria i to this cause.

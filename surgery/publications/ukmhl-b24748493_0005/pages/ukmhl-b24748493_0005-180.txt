Klin. Woch.,' 1873) gives a case of strangulated diaphragmatic hernia in a man, set. 25. Percussion during life gave tympanitic resonance from the fifth left rib downwards to the xiphoid cartilage. After death the left lung was found covered by the stomach, which was distended and had carried with it through the left and posterior portion of tbe centrum tendineum, the large omentum, and almost all the transverse colon. The lung was in a state of atelectasis. The writer refers to other cases of the same kind, and thinks that the diagnosis, certainly difficult, may be made by a careful physical examination of the chest and abdomen. In traumatic cases the signs may be mistaken for those of pneumothorax. Kiekokl publishes (ib., 1874, 249) two cases of children, aged about 6 months, in whom he found the so-called Meckel's diverticulum given off from the ileum, near the caecum. Its calibre was less than that of the intestine ; in one case it hung free in the abdominal cavity, in the other it was attached to the mesentery by a fibrous cord. Before death both children, as also a third of the same family, whose body was not examined, had had vomiting and irregular stools. There were no signs of intestinal inflammation. V. Biaggi records (" Sable intestinal," ' Press Med. Beige,' 1874, 153) the case of a woman, set. 35, suffering from dyspepsia, who for several months passed with her stools soft and friable concretions of the appearance of chalk, and composed of a mixture of inorganic salts, organised debris, and numerous small calculous masses of singular forms and aspect. A. Laboulbene writes on the same subject ('Arch. Gen.,' xxii, 641). H. B. Sands ('New York Med. Jour.,' xx, 195) exhibited to the New York Pathological Society four small faecal concretions, dis- charged from an abscess following peritonitis, and due to ulceration of the vermiform appendix, in a man, set. 41.

16 plied with more blood tlian is siifllicient for their nourishment; on this account there are collateral passages, by which the blood can be transmitted from the right to the left side of the heart, without circu- lating through tlie lungs. Opening into the left auricle from the right, is an aperture, named the foramen ovale, by which a certain quantity of blood goes from the right to the left auricle, without entering the right ventricle; and originating at the root of the pulmonary artery, and terminating in the aorta, is a vessel called the ductus ai-teriosus, by which some of the blood which passed from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, is diverted towards the aorta, instead of circulating through the liuigs: thus the blood of the right auricle is divided into two streams, and that too of the right ventricle. The blood that is brought to the left auricle by the foramen ovale and pulmonary veins, is driven into the left ventricle, and from thence into the aorta, to be distributed to the different structures of the body. It is then returned by the umbilical arteries, to the placenta, in which organ the blood loses the deteriorating quality which it had acquired in the circulation through the fcetus, and is again rendered fit for nutrient purposes. At or near the ninth month cf pregnancy, the child attains a sufficient degree of vigour to live ex utero, it therefore is emancipated from that cavity, partly by its own efforts, but more particularly by a stimulus exerting those of the mother.

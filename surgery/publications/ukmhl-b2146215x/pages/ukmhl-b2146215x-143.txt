119 There are twelve pairs of dorsal nei'ves; the first lias ah eady been disposed of. The remaining eleven make then- exit from the canal, through the vertebral foramina; and after forming ganglia with the sympa- thetic, each nerve divides into an anterior, and poste- rior branch, to supply the muscles and integuments of the parietes of the chest and spine. The anterior branches of the lumbar, and sacral nei-ves, form the Crural Plexus. The principal branches sent off from this plexus, are, 1- Nervus Spermaticus Extemus, 2 Cutaneus Superior, 3 Glutaeus Superior, 4 Inferior, 5 Pudicus Communis, 6 Obturatorius, 7 Cruralis, 8 Sciaticus. The sciatic nerve divides, about half-way down the thigh, into 1â€” Nervus Fibularis, 2 Tibialis, which are distributed to the leg and foot. By showing the situation, and course of the nerves of the pelvis, and lower exti'eraity, we may

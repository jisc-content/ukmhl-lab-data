276 formis to the junction of the pubes, and then another lioni the umbilicus obliquely, upwards and outwards, over the cartilages of the ribs; this last incision is in the direction of the obliquus externus abdominis. This muscle is to be carefully dissected in the course of its fibres, and the student will find that they run inwards and downwards to terminate in an expanded tendon, or aponeurosis, the attachments of which towards the iliac, and pubic regions, must be particu- larly attended to. The first attachment to be noticed, is that of the aponeurosis to the anterior superior spi- nous process of the ilium; from this point, the tendon is extended to the inner extremity of the pubis, form- ing Poupart's ligament; and at the pubis, the tendi- nous fibres separate so as to leave a triangular aper- ture, which is called, the external abdominal ring. The other implantation of this muscle, which forms Gimbernat's ligament, will be mentioned when we enter on the particular Anatomy of hernia. We have said, that the muscles of one side of the abdomen meet those on the other, at the linea alba; this line, therefore, is another point into which the external oblique inuscle is inserted. Having reflected the integuments, and exposed the whole of the obliquus externus, the student must observe the umbilicus, the linea alba, the lineae semi- lunares, and linea; transversales. The umbilicus, now and then, yields so as to.cause visceral protrusion. The linea alba is formed by the interlacement of the apo-

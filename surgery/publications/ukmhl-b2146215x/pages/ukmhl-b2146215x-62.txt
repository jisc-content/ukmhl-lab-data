38 bedewed with its synovia, or secretion; it is classed amongst the most vascular structures of the body, for by coloured size injection, it can be rendered uniformly red. The arteries which are distributed to it, tenni- nate in two ways, viz.—in veins, and exhalents; the former to return the superfluous quantity of blood, the latter for the synovial secretion. The use of the synovia is to lubricate the articulating surfaces, for facilitating their motion upon each other. Besides the synovial membrane, we find the cartilages which tip the extremities of the bones of the joint; they are smooth, white, and extremely elastic; not very vascular, hence endowed only with a weak living principle. Within the knee-joint, there are ligameiits, connecting the heads of the bones; but the knee and hip aie the only articulations which are furnished with internal ligaments. Without, or on the exterior of the joint, how- ever, there is always one, or more ligaments; when only • one (a capsular), the deficiency is made up for, by means, which additionally strengthen this ligament; thus, in the shoulder, and hip-joints, the expanded tendons of muscles contribute much to increase the strength of the capsular ligament; but in the latter, we find the ligamentum teres, in addition to that circumstance; and in the former, the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle runs tlirough the cavity of the joint. - .'iiiii The ligamferits, like tWfcaitilagcs, are ^^ut spa- ringly organised. ■ ' ' ' •

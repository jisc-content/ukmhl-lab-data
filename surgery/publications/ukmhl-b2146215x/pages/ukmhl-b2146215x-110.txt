86 divided surfaces. In a little time, the surfaces adhere through the medium of effused lymph, and the calibre of the vessel is obliterated to the collateral branches, above and below the part on which the ligature was applied. When the artery is sealed, the thread is disengaged from its connections with the vessel, by ulcerating through the external coat. Dr. Jones considers the division of the internal, and middle coats, by the ligature, as an essential part in the operation; and that without it, the vessel could not be obliterated. This, however, has been contra- dicted by that excellent Surgeon, the late Mr. Allan Bums, of Glasgow; and Mr. Charles Bell combats the opinion of Dr. Jones on this subject, in his *' System of Dissections," published in 1809. It is certain, that tke immediate effect of a romid ligature, is the division of the muscular, and membra- nous tunics of the vessels; but that this is essential to obliteration, may, I think, be justly doubted; for we know, that a degree of pressure, which prevents the flow of blood through the artery, is sufficient to excite that adhesive inflammation which will end in an obliteration of its calibre; but that the obliteration is expedited by the injury which the ligature inflicts, there can be no question. In passing a ligature, we should take care to exclude every thing but the vessel; and to use as small

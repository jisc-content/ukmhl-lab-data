In mild hepatitis, there is an augmented secretion of bile; in a very acute attack, the formation of bile is suspended; and the stools are white, or clay coloured. The same happens with regard to the urine, in neph- ritis, &c. These effects of different degrees of inflam- mation, all secreting organs experience ; the remarks here emitted, will, therefore, allow of extensive appli- cation, and wiU serve to simplify the nature of certain dropsies, and the treatment which they requii-e. The Nervous System, which is next to be considered, exercises an absolute controul over all the fiinctions which we have hitherto described. The muscles, which are the active organs of loco-motion, are subordinate to it. The stomach cannot digest; the heart cannot beat; and the secreting organs cannot separate their fluids from the blood without it; indeed, it has the supreme dominion over all the functions of animal life, and its existence is the most striking distinguishing character between animal and vege- table substances.

341 pelvis, and ai-e implanted into the bones of the leg, as the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and biceps, act on the lower fragment, and give rise to the signs, which mark a fracture of the shaft of the bone. The patella is liable to be broken from the same causes as the olecranon ulnae, viz.â€”the action of mus- cles, and external force. If the fracture be transverse, the upper portion of the bone is di-awn upwai-ds by the action of the rectus femoris muscle. In fiactures of the bones of the leg, the lower fragments are acted upon by the gastrocnemii, and peronei muscles, and cai-ried backwards and outwards. Seeing that the displacing agents in fractures of the thigh, and leg, are the flexor muscles of the knee, and the extensor muscles of the foot; there can be little doubt as to the position which we should give the limb in fractures of the thigh and leg. In fracture of the shaft of the femur with displacement, we should relax the flexor muscles of the knee, in order to reduce the fragments, and we should presei-ve the semiflex position afterwards, in order to keep them reduced. In fractm-e of the bones of the leg, the gastrocnemii must be put in a state of relaxation, and kept so by retentive means, during the whole of the cui-e. I am aware that this practice is objected to by some Surgeons, paiticularly by the French, who advise an horizontal posture of the limb; but I saw nothing in the Pari-

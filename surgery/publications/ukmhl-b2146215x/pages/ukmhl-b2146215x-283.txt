255 is weakened, or destroyed, by over-distension; or that the action of the lymphatics is much under the influ- ence of the circulation; to whichever conclusion we come, the practical inferences are not materially diffe- rent, so far as dropsies are concerned. Such information as this, and coming from so respectable an authority, will have the effect of alter- ing our views with regai'd to effusions. We can no longer refer them to either increased secretion, or diminished absorption operating independently. In dropsy from active causes, there is not only an increased secretion, but also diminished absorption; and to cure in this case, we must bleed. Bleeding has recently been highly extolled, as a remedy in effusions; but it is in effusions from the above causes only, that it can do good, when they are of a passive nature; as in cases whei'e there is a want of energy, it must do harm. In di'opsies fr-om debility, an opposite indica- tion is necessary; and if we succeed in fulfilling it, the accumulated fluid will soon become absorbed, the equilibrium of exhalation and absorption be restored, and the parts again resume their healthy function; but this happy termination can only be expected, when thei'e is no organic disease. Serum is not the only fluid which may lodge in the chest; pus, and blood, have been discovered in many cases. The presence of pus most commonly results from the bui'sting of an abscess of the lungs;

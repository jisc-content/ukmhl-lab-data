60 Jeft auricle, and left ventricle, we find the bicnsped valve; and between the left ventricle, and root of the a.ajta, are the three valvulae serailunaj'es. The mecha- njsm of these membranous structures bespeaks a beautiful adaptation of means, to the fulfilment of an end which could not be dispensed.with. They some- times become ossified; this desti'oys theu' function, and, in time, proves fatal to the individual, who is the subject of this morbid change. The heart is admirably constructed in all its parts, and so clear are the uses of its structural arrangements, as to tell at once the purposes of this important organ. It vdll appear extraordinaiy, then, to all who know the anatomy of the heart, that the circulation of the blood remained undiscovered so long as it did; but the astonishment must cease, when we reflect, that the true anatomy of this organ was npt accurately known; and that the discovery of its ' function was almost contemporaiy, with that of its real mechanism, and structiu-e. The assistance which Anatomy lends to Physio- , logy, is forcibly illustrated by the important fruit of -Harvey's industry, and observation. One of the principal circumstances Avhich led him to detect the coiu-se of the current of blood, was an examination of the manner in which the valves ai-e disposed. Other Anatomists, before him, shewed an imperfect know- ledge of some of the facts, which he afterwai-ds eluci-

66 A feeble pulse is indicated by the vessel striking the fingers feebly, and being easily obliterated by prcssui-e. The reverse of this is a strong pulse. The pulse is full, or small, according to the diajneter of the artery. A liard pulse is a resisting pulse. When tense and resisting, the pulse is wiry; so called from the impression of the artery on the fingers. This descrip- tion of pulse usually accompanies the phlegmasiaj, and active liaemorrhages. A soft pulse is an indi- cation of debilit}'. The pulse is regular, when the same interval of lime takes place between the pulsations, and when Ihe pulsations mamtain the same character. An irre- gular pulse is the reverse of this. The pulse is intermittent, when some pulsations , are wanting; and when the pulsations themselves vary in strength, and character. These are the most important varieties of the pulse. Some authors have enumerated many more; *^'and Galen has described thirty-six different kinds. ^' iOur judgment in the treatment of disease is often ^' founded on the state of the pulse; it is one of our " most certain guides; but it must be admitted by the IPathologist, that it now and then deceives him.

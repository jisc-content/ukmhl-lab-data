ON THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Bffgre making insulated views of the groin, inside of the. thigh, ham, leg, and foot, I shall give some prefatoiy remarks on the bones, joints, and mus- cles of the lower exti-emity. The thigh -bone is the longest and largest cylin- drical bone in ihe body. Above, it is received into the acetabulum of the pelvis; below, it is articulated with the tibia, and patella. Its remarkable parts are, the head, neck, great ti-ochanter, little ti-ochanter, linea aspera, and condyles. The hip-joint is like the shoulder, an orbicular one • but the acetabulum, formed by the ilium, ischium, and'pubis, is much deeper than the glenoid cavity of tbe scapula.

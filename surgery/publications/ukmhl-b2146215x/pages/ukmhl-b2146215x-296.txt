There are some important nerves in the chest, to which the student must attend; they are the par vagum, grand sympathetic, phrenic, and intercostals. The par vagum, sympathetic, and phrenic nerves, are more or less connected by filaments; hence the extreme sympathy, which exists between the heart, Jungs, diaphragm, and stomach, in health and disease. The par vagum are nerves of very considerable importance, and have more engaged the attention of Physiologists than any other pair. The experiments made upon them by Haighton, Dupuytren, Le Gallois, Philips, Brodie, and other modern Physio- logists, are highly interesting. These nerves contri- bute to supply the phai-ynx, larynx, hc;u-t, Imigs, oesophagus, and stomach, with nervous energy; we

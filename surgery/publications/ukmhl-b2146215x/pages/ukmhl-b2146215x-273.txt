In the performance of all operations, we wish as much as possible to avoid an eifusion of blood, as its presence obscures the parts to be divided by the knife; hcemon-hage is one soui-ce of that intimidation which evei-y youug operator feels, and of which, experience alone can perfectly divest him. The student has already seen, that the external jugular vein runs superficially; without care, this vessel, or some of its larger branches, may be cut in making the incision through the integument. The trunk of the vein is not endangered in the majority of subjects, as its course is obliquely outwards; but there is usually a pretty considerable branch, which Fyfe calls, the " anterior jugular," which ascends between the trachea and inner edge of the sterno mastoid mus- cle, and this ought to be avoided by the knife; but there are frequent varieties in the distribution of venous branches throughout the body; therefore we must ti7 to make them apparent by distension, which is done by pressing on the main tnmk, so as to inter- cept the current of blood towards the heart. There is another portion of the neck, which the student has to dissect, viz.â€”the triangular space

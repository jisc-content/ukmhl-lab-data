340 The benders outwards are, the perouei, and ex- tensor longus digitorum. The toesj like the fingers, can be bent, extended, abducted, and adducted. The flexors and extensors are named according to the toes which the supply. The abductors are, the abductor pollicis, abductor - minimi digiti, and interossei anteriores. The adductors are, the adductor pollicis, traus- versalis pedis, and interossei posteriores. Let us now see how these muscles produce the ' signs of fractui-e, when the solution of continuity in the bones is complete. ' " ' •»•.-! When the cervix femoris is broken through, the limb is shortened, because the muscles which take!*: their origin from the pelvis, and are inserted into, orsii near the ti-ochanter, pull the lower portion of the bone' upwards; and the toes are turned outwards, principally from the rotators outwai-ds, being more powerful than!'> the rotators inwards. When the fracture happens below the ti-ochanters, there are various muscles both above and below ih& ~ seat of accident. There are some attached to the femur tliroughout its whole length, and from being connected with both fragments, would not occasion much displacement; but those which arise from the

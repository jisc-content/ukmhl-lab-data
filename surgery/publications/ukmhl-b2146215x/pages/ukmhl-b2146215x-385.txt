355 '""Without kuowing- the orig-inal seat of the testes; how the peritoneum covers theii- anterior surface; and how the same membrane sends a process through the internal abdominal ring; it is not possible to under- stand the manner in which the tunica vaginalis, and timica vaginalis reflexa are formed. The student is much perplexed by finding, in dif- ferent Anatomical Works, diiferent names given to the membranes connected with the testis. Some writers call the close tunic, the timica albuginea; and the reflected one, the tunica vaginalis. Others regard the timica albuginea as a distinct structure, and not derived from the peritoneum; that it is the proper covering of the testis ; and that the septulas, or parti- '^'tions, which we meet with in the body of the gland, ''hetween the blood-vessels and seminiferous tubes, are 'processes of it. I am inclined to admit this as being •' really the case; therefore the testis vckj be said to " have three tunics; two close, and one reflected; and - they may be named, for distinction sake, tunica pro- ■pria, tunica vaginalis testis, and tunica vaginalis i'reflexa ; and these names, we shall take the liberty of adopting. The testis, then, in abdomine, has a par- tial investment from the peritoneum, besides its proper coat; the gland descends to the abdominal ring, car- rying with it the tunica propria, and tunica vaginalis testis. At the ring, it finds a cul de sac, or pouch of peritoneum, which is protruded, before the testis, into the scrotum, and forms the tunica vaginalis reflexa.

With regard to the lower extremities, no absorbent glands exist below the ham; nor are there any between the ham, and the lower row of inguinal glands ; there- fore, no swellings in the intermediate situations can be glandular. Any initation of the foot may occasion a tumefaction of the inguinal glands, in which the absor- bents, which accompany the great saphenous vein^ terminate. Bubo, from the absorption of the syplii>-. litic vims, is seated in the upper row of the inguinal glands; this distinction is of practical importance. When the testes are attacked by a malignant disease, the malignancy is communicated to the glands of the loins. In cancer of the uterus, the iliac, or lumbar glands, or both, will become affected. The state of the mesenteric glands, in the disease called tabes mesenterica, and the symptoms attending it, are explained elsewhere. We have thus followed the routes which poisons take, to enter into the mass of blood; and have eluci- dated many of the healthy and morbid phenomena of the absorbent system. Having traced the chyle and lymph to the circu- lating mass of blood, we are naturally induced to speak next of the Sanguiferous System; includ- ing a set of organs, by which the nourishment is conveyed to the different stnictui es of the body.

G3 the internal principally supplies the pelvic viscera; the external passes luider Poupai-f s ligament, to the lower extremity. This is a general idea of the distri- bution of the ai-terial system. The arteries terminate in six ways, viz.—in anastomosing with other branches; in veins; in the excretoj^ ducts of glands; in exhalent vessels; 'in cells; and in colom-less, or serous branches. In their course, from their origin to their terminations, some branches pass off from the trunks, at acute angles; others more obtusely. After making their angles,' and flexions, they rmi, for the most part, inl stiaight direction; with the exception of such arteries as supply parts which are subject to be stretched, or where a conti-ivance is necessary, in order to break the force of cii'culation; thus, in the lips, uterus, and brain, they take a toi-tuous, or serpentine course. An artery is a tube composed of coats; which coats have vasa vasorum, lymphatics, and nerves. They are three in number, arid named, the ceUular, or elastic, the muscular, and the membranous. It is to the first coat, that an arteiy owes its ability to retain a cylindrical form, when cut across. The Veins are those vessels which return the blood of the arteries back again to the heart. They arise from two sources, viz.—from the extremities of arteries, and from cells; and terminate in the aui'icles of the heart. The veins of the head, neck, and upper

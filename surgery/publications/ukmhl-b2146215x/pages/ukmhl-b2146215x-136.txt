112 the pons Varolii; the crura cerebri; the crura cerebelli â€¢, the fourth ventricle: the corpora olivaria; the corpora pyramidalia; and by a vertical section of the cerebel- lum, we produce an appearance, which is called the arbor vitJE. I shall refer the student to works pro- fessedly anatomical, for the more minute anatomy of the brain. Of the uses of the individual prominences of the cerebral organ, we cannot, as yet, boast of any posi- tive knowledge. From the optic nerves taking their origin, in great measure, from the thalami nervorum opticorum, these bodies have been considered, by Physiologists, as particularly subservient to the visual function; but, in the "Archives Generales de Mede- cine," for June, 1823, there is a Paper, by M. M. Foville and Pinel-Grandchamps, in which, the authors assign another function to them. At a Meeting of the "Academic Royale de Medecine," they related the case of a female, who had laboured for several years under a complete paralysis of the upper and lower extremities of the left side. An old extra- vasation was found in the right hemisphere of the brain, in the medullary space, outwai-dly^ between the thalami optici, and corpora striata; and equally affect- ing these two parts. M. M. Foville and Pinel-Grand- champs presented this fact to the Academy, as con- finning their previous observations, that the seat of motion in the upper exti-emities, is placed in the tha- lami, and that of motion m the lower, in the corpora striata.

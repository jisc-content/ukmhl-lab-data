208 den, Sharpe, Walker, CMieValief-; inxl't^ie a'pititxiif^of some Medical Men, that the disease is constitutional, and therefore, that the removal of the enlarged gland is doing- nothing, Mr. Grainger states the method of operating which he has adopted, and used in a great number of cases with invariable success. The instru- ment which he employs, is a double silver tube, about three or four inches long, according to the age of the patient from whose throat the tonsil is to be removed; through this, a well annealed silver wire is to be di-awn so as to leave a noose at one end, of such a size as to enable the Surgeon to pass it easily over the enlarged tonsil; and the wire is to be tightened daily, untQ tlie tumour falls off by strangulation. But it wonld appear by note D, in the Appendix to Mr. Pattison's Edition of Burns' Work, that there is no necessity for allowing the Avire to remain about the neck of the tumour, until the period of separation; and Mk is certainly tiaie, as a few hours must be sufficient to destroy its life. Mr. Pattison mentions Dr. Physick's plan of removing the tonsil, which is the same as Mr. Grainger's, with two exceptions, viz.â€”his using soft pure iron wire instead of silver, and removing the insti-ument twenty-four hom-s after its application. The mode of disengaging the Avire is simple, nothing more being necessary than to push a portion of it back through the canula, until the noose is so much enlarged as to slip over the tonsil.

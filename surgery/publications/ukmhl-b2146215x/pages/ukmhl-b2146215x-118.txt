94 Very many serious diseases owe their existence to a deranged state of the biliary secretion. It may be in a deficient quantity, when the functions of digestion and defaecation will suffer; or may be in excess, as in yeUow fever, and in that fatal disease called, cholera morbus; but in these disorders, it is acrid in property, as well as redundant in quantity. The bile may be prevented from passing into the intestines, in which case it will become absorbed, and by entering into the mass of blood, produce jaundice. The obstruction may be temporary, from the pressure on the ducts by suxrounding viscera, as in jaundice from pregnancy; but it is more lasting often in cases of obstruction from a biliary calculus. Biliary calculi are not unfrequentiy found in the gall-bladder, without giving any signs of their existence during life; but if one, or more, should pass into the ducts, very painfiU and dangerous consequences may follow, ■j.' . '''"Biliary concretions are proposed to be arranged under four classes. ""' In the first class, is that kind of gall-stone which has a white colour, and a chrj'stallized, shining, lami- nated, sti-ucture; it is soluble in oil of tuiTentine, and piire alkalies; and of an oval form. 2dly.—That kind which is polygonal, or roimd in its formation, and of a light greyish brown colour.

35G Nothing can be more simple to understand than this, and when understood, it is easy to comprehend the nature of cong-enital hernia, and hydrocele in children. It is clear, that after the testis has carried Avith it the peritoneum which was at the ring, a communication will exist between the cavity of the abdomen, and that of the elongated sac, constituting the tunica vaginalis reflexa; but, naturally, this commimication does not long remain, for an adhesive process usually takes place, by whicb the neck of the' sac is closed; this, though commonly, is not, however, constantly the case; and a default of this kind gives rise to the dis- eases before mentioned. Between hernia congenita, and other herni£E, there is this difference; in the foiv*. mer, the tunica vaginalis reflexa forms the hernial sac^ in the latter, the sac is produced by a gradual stretchfC ing, or elongation of the peritoneum, from the pres^ siire of the protruded viscera: and between hydi-ocele in children, from the above stated cause, and the com- mon hydi-ocele at a more advanced age, there is this difference; in the former, there is a communication between the cavity of the abdomen, and that of the timica vaginalis reflexa; but in the latter, the tunica vaginalis reflexa is a bag without an opening. In tbe hydrocele of childhood, and of adult age, the effused fluid occupies tbe same situation, viz.—the tunica vaginalis reflexa; and the testis, with its tunica vagi- nalis testis, is behind the serous collection. a) There is a variety of congenital liernia produced,

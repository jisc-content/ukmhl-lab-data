262 But in phthisis from a specific cause, the case is quite different; the disease is dependant on inherent detects, and without eradicating these, all attempts at cure will be inefficient; in such a case, it is obvious, the operation can do no good. The distinctions established are, in a practical point of view, of exti-eme importance; and expose, I think, in a striking manner, the probable efficiency, and inefficiency, of Dr. Carsoii's proposal. The lungs are closely applied to the inner surface of the ribs, and this will lead the student to reflect on the dangerous effects of wounds of the chest, and the consequences of fractures of the costs. If a sharp instrument be tlu-ust through the intervals of the ribs, it must, almost of necessity, wound the lungs, and the probabUity is, that the person will die fi-om hcemon-hage. The blood wiU not flow through the aperture which has been made in the parietes, but into the cavity of the thorax; for on aii- being admitted, the lungs will recede. If a rib be fi-actured in a pointed manner, and the sharp fragment be forcibly di-iven inwards, it may tear through the pleura pulmonalis, and peneti-ate the lung; a lacerated wound of this kind is not commonly suc- ceeded by much hoemorrhage, but there will be another eflect, which is almost constant, viz.-em-

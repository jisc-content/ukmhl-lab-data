That friction by any oint- ment is likely to do good, no one will doubt; as it is a powerful means of exciting the action of the absor- bents, but I should place more confidence on mercurial than iodine ointment; and as absorption may be pro- moted by combining internal medicines with topical applications, I should have more dependence on small doses of calomel, than on either burnt sponge, pr iodine. The practicabUity of extirpating the thyroid gland when so enlarged as to interfere with respiration, and deglutition, is a point to which much consideration has been given. The use of the knife has been depre- cated by some Surgeons, on account of the terrible hoemorrhage which would succeed, and certain it is, that without precautionary measures, this would offer an insuperable objection.

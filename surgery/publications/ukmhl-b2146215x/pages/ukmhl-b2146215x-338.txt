308 It is of the orbicular, in other words, of the ball aud socket kind. The glenoid cavity of the scapula is shallow, the head of the os humeri large; hence they ai-e not so closely fitted to each other, as the caput fenioris is to the acetabulum. It is this cii-cum- stance, in a great measure, which gives to the shoul- der-joint its great extent of motion, and to it is owing its liability to dislocation; for great freedom, and great strength of articulation are not compatible with each other. The shoulder-joint has-a capsular ligament only; this, however, is sti-engthened by the aponeu- rotic expansions of the muscles of the scapula. The tendons of the supra spinatus, infra spiuatus, subsca- pularis, and teres minor muscles, are spread upon the capsular ligament; and but for this, the os humeri would be much more frequently dislocated than it is. What serves additionally to prevent this accident, is the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle, which passes through the joint on its fore part. lii the dry bone the glenoid cavity is very super- ficial, but in the recent subject it will be observed to be less so; for around the edge of the cavity a liga- mento-cartilaginous substance projects, by which the socket is deepened the eighth of an inch or more It is contended by some Surgeons, tbat the os ^''humeri may be completely dislocated in four direc- tions, viz.-upwards, downwards, forwards, and back- wards, but Su- Astley Cooper mentions the three last

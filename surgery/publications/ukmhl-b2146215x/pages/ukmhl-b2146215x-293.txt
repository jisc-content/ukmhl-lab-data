2G5 From the arch of the aorta arise tliree consi- ilerable vessels, viz.â€”the arteria innominata, the left carotid, and the left subclavian. The left subclavian vein crosses the roots of the vessels, but more espe- cially those of the left carotid, and the arteria innomi- nata ; the b'achea lies between the tvfo carotid arteries, and behind the arteria innominata. The student should pay particular attention to the situation of the arch of the aorta, and the vessels which originate fi-om it; for the arch or curvature is the fi-equent seat of aneiu'ism. When the tumour is large it presses forwards on the upper bone of the sternum, and extremities of the first ribs, and will frequently cause an absox-ption of these structm-es. It presses backwards on the trachea, and oesophagus, hence the difficulty of breathing and deglutition in cases of this kind. There are no positive signs by which incipient aneurism of the arch can be delected, but when the tumour becomes large, it will extend upwards so as to manifest itself by pulsation above the sternum. An aueurismal swelling of tlie curvature, has on this account, been mistaken for aneiu-ism of the arteria innominata, and of the left subclavian ai-teiy. The heart is pretty closely in contact with the surface of the pericardium; a penetrating wound in the caidiac region, therefore, would scarcely iujui-e the latter without the for nier. Wounds of the peri- cardium and heart, are mortal; but not immediately

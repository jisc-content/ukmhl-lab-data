178 compression, in consequence of a rupture of blood- vessels, effusion, or suppuration. The symptoms of compression are very similar to those of concussion, with these exceptions; the pupils of the eye are usually more affected, the pulse is slow and labom-ing-, and the breathing stertorous. Com- pression may arise from any cause which produces an enci'oachment on the brain, as depression of bone, extravasation of blood, effusion of lymph, or the formation of matter; but these causes do not necessa- rily give birth to symptoms of compression. The summaiy of the practice, in the different injuries of the head, is as follows :â€” In case of concussion, with, or without fracture, depletion, with the common auxiliary means, must be had recourse to, after the depressed state of the system, immediately consequent on the violence, has gone off. In case of compression, from simple fi-acture, with depression of bone, full bleeding must be em- ployed; should the symptoms not yield, the fragment must be raised. In case of compression, from compound fr acture, with depression of bone, we are advised immediately to trephine.

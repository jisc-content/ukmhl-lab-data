150 membrane. The nose is divided into two nostrils, by the septum narium; and in each nostril aie elevations, formed by the spongy, or turbinated bones, which afford an extensive surface for the expansion of the lining membrane. This membrane is supplied with the first paii- of nerves, which take their origin from the anterior lobes of the brain. They are called the olfactory, and their numerous filaments are sent through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to be distributed to the pituitary membrane, which is the seat of the sense of smell, and the som-ce of the mucus of the nostrils. The Physiology of smell is more simple than that of seeing, and hearing. From certain bodies, are constantly escaping small particles, whose motion is influenced by the air. This, in passing through the nosti-ils to the lungs, applies the odorous effluvia to the pituitary membrane; and the impression thus niade, is transmitted by the olfactoiy nerves to the brain. This sense is an important one, and contributes much to the gratifications, and pleasures of life. The fourth of the senses, is the sense of taste, a faculty which resides in the papillae of the tongue. The Tongue is divided by Anatomists, into base,

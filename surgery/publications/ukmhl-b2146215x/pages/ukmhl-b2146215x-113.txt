A.—The organs of loco-motion are the bones, joints, and muscles. In the bones, we find an oily substance, which is called marrow; it is secreted by the membrana medul- laris, or that vascular membrane which lines the can- cellated structure of bone. On analysis, it is found to consist of pure marrow, albumen, gelatin, a peculiar extractive matter, and water. In the moveable articulations, we find the eapsu-'' lar ligament lined by a very delicate membrane of extreme vascularity, and called the synovial mem-' brane. It secretes the synovia, which lubricates the articulatory surfaces. Synovia is composed of albu- men, gelatin, mucilage, water, and a small quantity of the muriate of soda. With the tendons of certain muscles, there are connected hursse mucosae. They are furnished with a synovial membrane for secreting a fluid, N

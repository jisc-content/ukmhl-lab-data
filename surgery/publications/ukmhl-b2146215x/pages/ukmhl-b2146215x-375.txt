In a former part of the volume, we described the abdominal muscles; but we did not particularize on their connections at the groin. To do this, will be the present object. If an incision be made from about three inches below the umbilicus, to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium; and another from the commence- ment of this incision, perpendicularly to the sym- physis pubis; we include a portion of integument, under which, are the parts concerned in inguinal and crural hernia;. To display these parts, another inci- sion in the integument is required, from the centre of the transverse one, directly downwards, to about three inches below the groin; two flaps of skin will thus be formed, and these flaps are to be carefully dis- sected from the condensed layer of cellular membrane underneath, and reflected; the inner towards the linea alba, and symphysis pubis; the outer towards the spine of the ilium, and the outer part of the thigh. The condensed membrane, Avliich is now seen cover- ing the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, Poupart's ligament, the spermatic cord, after emerg- â€¢2 V

334 Astley Cooper, is the absence of ossific action in the head of the thigh bone, from being separated from its cervix; its life being then solely supported by the ligamentum teres, which has only a few minute vessels ramifying from it to the head of the bone. May we not, with propriety, add a fourth, viz.â€” the age of the patient? Fractures of the cervix femoris occur, in eight cases out of ten, in persons far advanced in years, and we know that the littie vitality of bone, in old age, often proves a preventive to re-union in any situation. Sir Astley Cooper's opinion, then, is dii-ectly opposed to that of Desaidt, and other Siu-geons; he maintains, that re-union has never happened in his practice, when the fracture is witliin the capsulai- lio-ament, and retains no connection with the trochanter mljor On the other hand, we find distinctly stated in the sixth case of Desault, that a fracture through the middle of the neck of the thigh-bone, was united, without deformity, on the forty-fourth day. Sir Astley Cooper believes that re-union can take place in the second and third species, but not m the first This belief may certainly lead to the error which M Roux apprehends, viz.-that those supposed to be ,./^7m. the ligament will be left to themselves; those witJiout it, only, being capable of consolidation.

It would occupy too much space to notice the Author's opinions on the nature of the diseases he treats; hut there are some points so relevant to the subject of the muscles, that I cannot refrain from giving them a place in this volume. Amongst other causes, he mentions debility of the muscles as one of the most frequent forerunners of distortion; he says " the muscles, whose office it is to support the vertebrae, may be so weakened by want of exercise, as to become incapable of performing their functions. When this takes place, the vertebra, and the ligaments which bind them together, yield to the superincumbent weight, for they are alFeeted in a secondary manner, by the same causes that have pro- duced debility in the muscles." I cannot make up my mind to think that muscular or general debility, is sufficient to produce a lateral cm-vatiu-e of the spme, miless conjoined to an indul- gence in certain malpositions of the trunk; this alone, as Mr. Shaw admits in another part of the Volume, may occasion distortion, even though the person were at the time in good health, but they would operate in an increased degree in ill health : or in the weak con- dition that generally follows fever or measles. When we exercise certain muscles, we increase the power of those muscles ; when then we indulge in inclining the body to one side, I can easily conceive that the acting muscles would in time gain such an ascendancy

22 • Bone is the hardest and strongest structure in the body, and its functions recj^uii-e that it should be so. We should suspect, from a superficial examination of this substance, and from its resisting, for ages, the decomposition which dead organic matter usually vmdergoes, that it is not an organised structure,—that is to say, not possessing arteries, veins, nerves, and absorbents; but injection proves that it is vascular; and the phenomena of disease inform us, that it has nerves and absorbents. But there is, superadded to these and its animal substance, an earthy material, upon the presence of which depends its peculiarity in solidity, weight, and strength. Before mentioning the composition of bone we will advert to its origin, and the process of its formation; two very interesting physiological inquiries. Its origin is to be sought for in that state of existence, when an impenetrable mys- tery hangs" over all the operations of nature, and when human scrutiny cannot detect the secret changes which are taking place in organising matter. In the early period of conception, all the systems of the body are, to our observation, homogeneous; the bones, the muscles, and the other organs, are all apparently of the same nature; and imtil the formative faculty gives to each part its peculiar character, we are at a loss how to distinguish them. We may call the first condition of the foetus, mucous; therefore, bone, at its origin, may be said to be in a mucous, or gelatinous state. A degree of firmness, which it soon acquires, enables us to detect it from surroimding parts; as it changes

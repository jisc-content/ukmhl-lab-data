266 so in all cases, for Portal mentions an instance of a soldier who lived fifteen days: the wonnd in this case could not have communicated with either of the cavities. The heart is liable to the same diseases as other organs, but its function peculiarly predisposes it to preternatural dilatation; enlargement therefore is one of the most common morbid conditions of this organ. With the exception of carditis, we are not in posses- sion of any iirfallible means of forming a diagnosis of the diseases of the heart; that is to say, of distinguish- ing one disease from another, by the prevailing symp- toms; and it is so often sympathetically affected as to perplex the judgment of practitioners. Palpitations, frequent faintings, and ii-regixliu-ity of the pulse, are chaiacteristics of troubled circulation; but whether they arise from a disease of the heart itself, or of the vessels, or of the pericardium, or of the lungs, or of the diaphragm, or of the stomach, or of more distant parts; it is not always easy to determine. No diseases are more liable to he confounded with each other, than those of the heart and lungs; the functional relations which subsist between these organs, is such, that one of them cannot be materially deranged in structure, without the other being more or less affected. When the heart is diseased, the function of respiration suf- fers ; and when the lungs are disordered, circulation is embai-rassed. How desirable would it be then to possess a test of the actual seat of disease.

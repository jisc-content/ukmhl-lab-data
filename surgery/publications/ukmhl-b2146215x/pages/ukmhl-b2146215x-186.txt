The reticular is found in situ- ations where a considerable degi-ee of motion is neces- sary ; the adipose occupies parts where the motion is limited. The great distinction between the two is this: betwixt the cells of the former, there is a free communication, as observed in cedematous, and em- physematous swellings; but the cells of the latter do not at all communicate; each cell is a distinct glandu- lar part, and like to other secretuig organs, exceed- ingly vascular.

28 iveiglit, and even to the pressure of sitrrotinding parts. A partial existence of this disease gives rise to distor- tions, often of vital importance to the female sex. We have a proof of the presence of earthy matter by the foregoing experiments; but another circum- stance will corroborate the fact. If we examine a bone after it has been submitted to the process of calcination, its brittleness will clearly evince that the earthy material alone remains. An alteration, analo.- gous to this, occms in the disease, called fragilitas ossium; here, the bone is rendered fragile, in conse- quence of the animal and saline substances not existing in theii' due and natural proportion. In neither of the experiments, whether to show the eaithy or animal material, is the shape of the bone altered; thus we see how intimately the two substances ai-e blended; how essential is their accurate combination; and how '"^iseless the one is without the other. Anatomy, Phy- -'feiblogy, and Pathology, in these instances, as in others, ^^teciprocally assist in the elucidation of healthy and ■'forbid phenomena. All the bones of the body are covered with a membranous structure, named periosteum, which is in" immediate contact with their external surface: like other membranes, it is separable into laminae. During the periods of ossilication, and reparation of '^'^iiijiu-ies in bone, this membrane is crowded with blood- ■-^Vessels; but in a natural state-;, it is not vascular,-and

62 are, the right cavities of the heart, the puhnonary artery, and its ramifications, and the radicles and trunks of the pnhnonary veins; those connected with the latter, are, the left auricle, and ventricle, the arteries, and the veins. The Arteries are the vessels, which convey the blood from the heart, to the different structures of the body. They originate in two main trunks, viz.â€” the pulmonary artery, and aorta; the pulmonary arteiy arises from the right ventricle of the heart, and is distributed to the lungs; the aorta springs from the left ventricle, and divides, and subdivides, into branches, which go to all the other organised parts of the body. After its origin, the aorta forms a curvature, or arch, from wliich part, vessels pass off to the neck, head, and Upper extremities. It then descends on the left of the spine; and whilst in the chest, sends off the mtercostal, oesophageal, and bhronchial branches. After emerging from the thorax, it begins to supply the abdominal viscera; some of its branches are azygous, or single'; others are in pairs. The single branches arc, the cajliac, the superior, and iiiferior mesenteric, which are distrii buted to the stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, and iiitcstiues. The double branches are, the diaphrag- matic, the renal, the spermatic, and the lumbar. At the fourth, or fifth lumbar vertebra, the aorta bifhr- cates into the common iliac arteries. Each common iliac subdivides into an internal and external branch ; t

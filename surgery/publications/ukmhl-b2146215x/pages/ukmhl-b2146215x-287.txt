259 sion of the ribs, and the ascent of the diaphragm; the ribs fall in consequence of the intercostales ceasing to act, and by the contraction of the sterno costales, and the five paii-s of muscles of the abdomen, aided occa- sionally by the longissimi dorsi, sacro-lumbales, and quadi-ati limiborum muscles. Tt is to be remembered that the diaphragm is the principal agent in both parts of respiration, when the function is executed in a natural maimer. In ordinary breathing, it is but feebly assisted, even by the intercostales ; and it is only when respiration is exceedingly laborious, that the other muscles attached to the ribs ai-e called into action. The lungs are accurately fitted to tlie cavity in which they lie, as well in expiration, as inspii-ation; this results from the elastic property of these organs. They are kept distended by the pressure of the atmos- phere; but on puncturing the chest, air wUl rush into the cavity, and then by the pressure on oue side being counter-balanced by pressure on the other, the kmgs collapse, because the elastic power can now act with- out resistance. A practical deduction has lately been drawn fi-om this knowledge by Dr. Cai-son, of Liver- pool, and he has applied it to the treatment of the most fatal of all diseases, consumption of the lungs. In an advanced state of phthisis, vomicaj, or ab- scesses; ulcerations, and other morbid appearances, are found in the substance of the limgs.

NECK. The complicated Anatomy of the Neck, and the serious operations which are occasionally performed on this pai-t, render it imperative that the student should pay particular attention to it. He must accu- rately observe the coverings, the fascia, the muscles, the blood-vessels, nerves, and glands. The cutaneous muscles, veins, and fascia, must be traced; the mus- cles must be examined in their relation to the arteries; the arteries, veins, and nerves, in relation to the muscles, and to each other; and the absorbent and salivary glands in their relation to the trunk, and branches of the carotid. Before beginning the dissection of the neck, he should examine the prominent parts of the thi-oat through their natural covering; and by drawing lines, should familiarize himself with the relation of the muscles to the important blood-vessels and nei-ves. In studying the relative Anatomy of the neck, a great thing to be attended to is the position of the head. When the head is placed parallel to the horizon, all the hard parts are more distinct, and the distance between the chin and sternum is, of course, less than when the head is turned back. In either position, however, the OS hyoides, the thyroid cartilage, the cricoid cartilage, and the trachea may be felt. The most important cir- cumstances in the Anatomy of the neck, are the course and connections of the carotid arteries. We know,

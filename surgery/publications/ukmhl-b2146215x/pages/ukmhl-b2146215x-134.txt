110 Gall and Spurzeim's anatomical researches have induced them to come to the following conclusions; that the cincriteous and medullary substances of the brain, are inseparable, the one from the other; that the former is the matrix of the latter; that the medulla is composed of white fibres, which converge towards certain points, named, commissui-es; and that these commissures are the media of communication of the fibres of the opposite sides of the brain; in all this, I see no inconsistency, and nothing but what we may suppose to be tnie; but the doctrine is in its infancy, and if not well founded, will be sure to experience the fate of other anatomical opinions, equally plausible at the period of their birth; but foiuid untenable by the searchers after truth. We have stated, that Gall and Spurzeim believe that the cortical part of the brain is the matiix of the medullai-y; and consequently, of the nerves. Pro- fessor Tiedemann, who has made many interesting researcbes in the Anatomy of the brain, is opposed to this opinion. He says, that the cortical matter is formed after the medullary; and that the origui of the ^spinal and cerebral nerves, are visible before the least trace of the former can be observed. There are many other points, in which Anatomists disagi-ee; we should therefore, as yet, be very cautious in inclining our minds to any particular docti-ine. The brain is usually divided into three parts,

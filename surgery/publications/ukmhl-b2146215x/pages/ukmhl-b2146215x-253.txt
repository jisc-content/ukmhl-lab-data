227 It is i^ot requisite that I should point out the cases in which the ligature of the carotid aitery may be required; for information on that subject, I cannot refer the student to a better work, than Mr. Hodgson's " Treatise on the Diseases of Arteries and Veins;" nor need I enter on the minute history of the operation, as Cooper's " Surgical Dictionarija work which is, or ought to be, in the possession of every student, gives it in detaU; but on the disease which oftencr calls for its performance than any other, viz -.â€”aneurism, I shall make a few general observations, which will apply to this disease in all situations. The arteries are organized like the other struc- tures of the body, hence are liable to the same morbid /changes. They may inflame; thicken; become ob- literated by adhesion, as the sequela of inflammation; suppurate; ulcerate; and die. But besides these dis- eases, arteries are more than other structures subject to an osseous deposit in their coats, by which theii- function is interfered with; and aneurism is pecuUar to them, unless the dilatation of veins in varix, niay be regarded as a similar disease. An aneurism may be briefly defined a pulsating tumour, having a communication with the interior of an artery; how it is formed, however, is a matter of controversy amongst Pathologists. In some cases, it no doubt consists merely in a preternatiu-al yielding of the coats of the vessel; whilst in others, one, two, or

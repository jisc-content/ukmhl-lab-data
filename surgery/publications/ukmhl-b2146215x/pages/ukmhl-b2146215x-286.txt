258 fore it would not be prudent to ijerform it; when in the lungs, the propriety is rendered less (questionable, by the theory of Dr. Carson, to which we shall pre- sently adA'ert. Having inquired into the natural, and most com- mon morbid conditions of the j)leura, we shall now notice the relative position of the organs of the thorax and the effects of respii'ation on the walls and contents of the chest. The heart is observed not to be in the median line, but inclining to the left side. To show how the lungs lie, they should be inflated, when it will be seen how perfectly they adapt themselves to the figure of the cavities, so as to leave between their surface and the parietes, no vacuity; this is the state in Avhich they are during life o.nd health. Respiration is their function; and consists of two parts, inspiration, and expiration. In inspiration, the chest is expanded on all sides, in consequence of an elevation of tlie ribs, and a descent of the diaphragm, produced by the contrac- tion of the intercostales, levatores costai-um, and diaphragm; assisted occasionally by the sterno mas- toidei, subclavii, sen-ati, pectorales, and latissimi dorsi muscles; but in order that the tlu-ee last sets of muscles act, the shoulders must be fixed.

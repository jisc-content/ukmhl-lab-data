151 body, ami apex; the base is fixed to the os Iiyoides ; but the apex is moveable. The substance of this organ is muscular, and the covering of it is the continuation of the lining membrane of the mouth. On the surface of the tongue are seen numerous small eminences, which are called papillae; some of them are much larger than others. They are divided into tlu-ee classes; those near the base ai-e named, the pa- pillje capitatae; those in the centre, the papillae mediae; and those at the apex, the papillae minimae; they appear to be the terminations of the nerves; the first class excepted, vehich ai-e supposed to be merely mucous glands. In the tongue, there are three sets of nerves, viz.â€”the lingual, the glosso phaiyngeal, and the gustatory. The lingual is believed to be the nei-ve of motion; the glosso pharyngeal, the nerve of secretion; and the gustatory, the nerve of taste; there is, how- ever, a considerable intermixture between the sets. The arteries, veins, and nerves, of one side of the tongue, are separated from those of the other, by the longitudinal line, called, the Raphe linguae. The sense of taste resides in the papillae mediae, et minimae. How sapid bodies act on these eminences, is a question which Physiologists cannot satisfactorily answer. Some consider that their action is chemical; others think, that it is mechanical; but as it is neces- saiT to the perfection of this function, that the sub-

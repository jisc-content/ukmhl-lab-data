267 Percussion of the thorax may enable us now and tlien to detect the presence of fluid in the chest; but it can do no more, and even in this, it is often deceptive. M. Laennec, an ingenious and skilful French Physician, and a pupil of the celebrated Corvisart, has recently proposed a new method of distinguishing the different diseases of the heart and lungs, by means of an acoustic insti'ument, which he calls the " Stethos- cope," of the use of which, a veiy favom able report has been made, by a committee of the Institute, com- posed of M, M. Portal, Pelletan, and Percy. The origin of the idea was this; M. Laennec was consulted in 1816, by a yoimg female, who had some general symptoms of a disease of the heai-t, and in whom the application of the hand, and percussion, gave no satisfactory results, on account of her embonpoint; recollecting the well-known acoustic phenomenon, that if the ear be applied to the end of a beam, one hears distinctly the scratch of a pin at the other end; he imagined, that a useful hint might be drawn from this property of bodies. He took a sheet of paper, and formed a roll of it well secured, of which he ap- plied one end to the region of the praecordia, and placing the ear at the other end, he was as much sur- prized as gratified in hearing the heart beat more clearly and distinctly than he had ever done, by the immediate application of the ear. This discovery led him to make a series of experiments at the Hosjiital

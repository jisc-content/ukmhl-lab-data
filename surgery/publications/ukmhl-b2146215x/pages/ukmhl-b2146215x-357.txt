327 formed by the bifurcation of the common median vein. On the median cephalic, and median basilic are seen some filaments from the external and internal cutane- ous nerves, and under the median basilic lies the bra- chial ai-tery, but separated irom it by an intervenmg fascia. The artery, vein, and median nerve are on the inner edge of the biceps tendon. It will be evident to the student after examinuig; the relation of the cutaneous veins to the artery, that there is some danger in opening the median basilic vein without care, because the artery is beneath it; but as varieties are constantly occurrmg in the branching off of the superficial veins, and in the com-se of the brachial artery and its division, it is never prudent to bleed in either of the veins without first ascertaining whether any artery is in danger of being wounded. In two of the subjects received into my dissecting-room last winter, there were vaiieties in the distribution of the arteries of the arm. In one, the brachial arteiy divided into the radial and ulnar branches a little below tbe axilla; the radial branch descended behind the median basilic vein, taking the same course that the brachial artery ordinarily does. In the other, the bifurcation took place about the middle of the ai-m, and the radial branch passed do^vnwards, immediately by the side of the cephalic median, and quite as super- ficial as the vein. Here a wound of the radial artery would have been endangered in bleeding from what is commonly the safest vein, because it is very distant

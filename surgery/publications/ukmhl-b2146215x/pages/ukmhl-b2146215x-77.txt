The origins, course, terminations, and pecu- liarities, of the absorbents and their glands, should be well understood; for otherwise, the functions, and morbid phenomena of the absorbent system cannot be explained. The absorbent vessels have three grand fimctions to perform, viz.â€”to can-y the nutritious matter into the mass of blood; to prevent effiisions in the circum-- scribed cavities; and to model the gi'owth of the body by removing superfluous parts. It is a law in nature, that all living bodies are constantly undergoing renovation, and decay; the blood-vessels are perpetuaUy depositing new materials; ajid the absorbents ai-e as perpetuaUy engaged in removuig the old. No solid, or fluid, can exist a great length of time, without a change: this is the state of living parts, whilst the operations of the system are under the influence of healthy action; but what takes place if the equilibrium, or balance between the function of renovation, and that of removal, be destroyed? If the transmission of nourishment be prevented, and the absorbents continue to act, emaci- ation must follow. If the blood-vessels perform their functions of deposit, and the lymphatics cease to

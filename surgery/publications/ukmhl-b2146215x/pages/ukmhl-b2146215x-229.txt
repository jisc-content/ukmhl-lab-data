On the Mouth.â€”In the anatomy of the mouth, I shall comprehend the space situated before, and tliat situated behind the curtain of the palate; ths former cavity is the mouth, commonly so called; the latter is usually named the fauces, or top of the throat. I shall call them anterior, and posterior cavities of the mouth, The boundai-ies of the anterior cavity when the jaw-bones are closed, are these; the roof is formed by the palatum durum; the floor by the tongue, and its connections; the anterior and lateral parts, by the alveolar processes, teeth, and gums; and the posterior part by the velum pendulum palati, vel palatum molle. All these parts (the alveolar processes and teeth excepted) are covered by the lining membrane of the mouth, which is similar in sti-uctm-e to the common integument; this is proved by its being occasionally alFected with the same specific eniptions as the skin, In order to gain a distinct view of the anterior cavity of the mouth, the student should make an in- cision from each angle of the lips, towards the articu- lations of the lower jaw, then by separating the two jaws; the tongue and its connections, and the 50ft palate will be fully exposed.

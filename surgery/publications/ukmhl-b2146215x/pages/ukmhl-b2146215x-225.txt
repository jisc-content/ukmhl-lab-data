199 The projections formed by the ossa spongiosa and all the boundaries of the nostrils are lined by the vascular pituitary membrane, which insinuates itself into all tJie cavities which communicate with the nosti-ils; thus the Iming membrane of the frontal, sphenoidal, ethmoidal, and maxillary sinuses, and the ductus ad nasum, would seem to be productions of it. There are two circumstances connected with the pituitai-y membrane, to which it will be well to advert, viz—its disposition greater than that of other mucous membranes, to give growth to polypous tumours, and to bleed. There are thiee common kinds of polypi of the nose, viz.—the fleshy polypus, the malignant poly- pus, and a third kind, which is merely an elongation or prolapsus of the mucous membrane. The first and second ai-e morbid productions; the tliird is a mere relaxation of the membrane. Epistaxis, or hcemorrhage from the nose, is often a salutaay efibrt made by nature, to relieve an over- distended state of the vessels of the brain; in this case, when the bleeding is within moderate limits, it is clear that it is better to encom-age, than to suppress it.. But hcemorrhage from the nose, is sometimes conse- quent on general relaxation; when, of course, it is prudent to check it at once, and to prevent its recur- rence by improving the general health. With the mode of plugging the nostrils, (an operation requii'ed when common means fail,) every student is familiar. S.

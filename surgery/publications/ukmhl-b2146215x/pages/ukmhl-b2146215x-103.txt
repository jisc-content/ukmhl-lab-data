79 of the glottis. AVhen the rima glottidis is narrow, the tone emitted is acute ; Avhen expanded, the tone is jrrave; and Avhen the air passes tlirough, without pro- ducing a tremor of the parts, the result is a whisper. The larynx is the organ of the voice ; but the instru- ments of speech, are the soft palate, the tongue, the lips, and other parts connected with the mouth and nose. But of all these, the tongue is the principal organ; for without it, we could not ai-ticulate any of the vowels or consonants distinctly. The great num- ber of small muscles, which compose the tongue, give to it a great variety, and great celerity of motion; and in the act of utterance it rapidly, and readily, applies itself to the different parts of the mouth. The sympathetic functions of the lungs are, cough- ing, sneezing, sighing, yawning, hiccup, and laughing. Coughing may be occasioned by any cause, which in-itates the sensible membrane which lines the trachea and larynx. It consists in a violent expii-ation, accompanied by a contraction of the trachea, and glottis, by which the air is expelled from the lungs, through the wmd-pipe, with a great force. A cough is, generally speaking, symptomatic of some morbid affection of the respiratory organs ; but it is not neces- sarily so, for it is often an attendant upon diseases of other viscera, and, therefore, merely sympathetic. A cough is not unusual in dyspepsia, and almost -always pi-esent in hepatic disorders.

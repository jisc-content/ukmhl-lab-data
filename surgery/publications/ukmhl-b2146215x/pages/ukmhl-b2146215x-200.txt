176 tm-es should be avoided; and notwithstandiiif? lliat excellent Surgeon, Mr. Pott, assents to their einploy- itient, for uniting certain lacerated wounds of the scalp, most surgeons of the present day object to them; on account of their being both dangerous, and unneces- sary. Tliree years ago, I saw an extensive laceration of the integuments of the forehead; in which case, the Surgeon was induced to retain the edges of the wound in contact, by sutures. On the day after the accident, the patient complained of considerable pain in the head; the edges of the wound were swollen, and much inflamed; an evaporative lotion, and leeches were applied to the temples; but in spite of these means, the inflammation of the scalp extended. The Surgeon prudently withdrew the ligatures; after wliich, the inflammation subsided, the pain of the head left, and the patient's convalescence was progx-essive. When we ai-e called to a patient in an insensible state; and, on enquiry, find that he has received a violent blow on the head, we tiy to ascertain, by means of a probe (if there be an external wound) whether the bone has suffered. We succeed, perhaps, in finding a fissme; but we are not to conclude, that the fissure has caused the symptoms, if they be those of concussion only; but if we discover that a portion of bone has been depressed, and symptoms of com- pression exist, then it is quite fair to suppose that the depressed fragment of bone is the cause of those symptoms; even if the depressed portion be small.

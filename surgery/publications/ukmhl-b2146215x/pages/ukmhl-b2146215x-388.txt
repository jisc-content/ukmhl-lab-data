358 ner in which the ujiper part of the thigh is shut out fi-om the ahdomen. By turning down the abdominal muscles, and peritoneum, and passing the finger under Poupart's ligament, he will find what is called the crural opening, which gives passage to the artery, and vein of the groin. The opening is not free, except at the inner side of the vein, and tliis is the part at wliich the protnision takes place in femoral hernia. The crural opening, or ring, is bounded, above, by Poupart's ligament, which is here called^ the crural arch; on the inner, or pubic side, by the ligament of Gimbernat, which presents to the finger a sharp edge; on the outer, or iliac side, and behind, by the psoas magnus, and iliacus muscles, and the fascia which covers them. The artery, and vein, are inclosed in a funnel-like sheath, which is formed, on the fore part, by the fascia transversalis ; and on the back part by the fascia iliaca, the membrane just mentioned as giving a covering to the psoas magnus, and iliacus internus muscles. The arteiy is on the iliac, and the vein on the pubic side of the crural ring. In femoral hernia, as in inguinal, the peritoneum forms the sac; the student may easily convince himself that this is the case, by separating the peritoneum from the inner surface of the abdominal muscles, and examining the manner in which it passes over the ring; and he will find, that no viscus can enter the crural ring Avithout cai-rying the peritoneum with it. If this membrane be

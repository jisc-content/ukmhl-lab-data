235 parts mentioned, must be observed: it will be found' that the internal carotid is deeper seated than the external, and separated from it by the styloid process of the temporal bone; that the extenial runs close to- the tonsil gland; and that there is an intricate an-ange- ment of stiiictures about the angle of the jaw. The internal carotid artery sends off no branch until it enters the skull; but the extenial begins imme- diately to supply the neighbourmg parts. The place of origiii of its branches frequentiy varies; but the following aie usually found to arise from it:â€”The superior thyroideal; the lingual; the facial, or extetr nal maxiUary; the ascending phaiTngeal; the occi- pital ; the temporal; and internal maxiUary. These different branches must be followed, ajxd their relations accurately noted. The parts about the basis, and angle of the jaw, cannot be well described; it is by dissection only, that a knowledge of them can be obtained. The student will then learn, how the sti-uc- tures of this portion of Anatomy aie intermixed; and that to remove a tiimour from this pai-t, is a serious operation, unless conducted with caye, and anatomir cal skill. The student is now to go to the central porr tion of the neck, in<;luding the trachea, oesophagus, and their connections. Above the trachea is the ps hyoides, to which the muscles of the tongue are attached; below the os hyoides is the thyroid carti^

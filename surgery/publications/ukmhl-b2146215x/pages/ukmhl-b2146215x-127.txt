103 The aqueous humour occupies the chambers of the eye, or that space situated between the cornea before, and the cajisule of the ciystalline lens behind. The vessels of the iris are supposed to secrete it. This fluid is a very powerful solvent; but chemical analysis goes no way towards explaining the reason of it; since it is nothing more than albumen, gelatin, water, and a little common salt. The crystalline lens is a solid substance; but we are in the habit of classing it amongst the humours of the eye. A fluid, however, is contained in its capsule. The lens refracts, and transmits the rays of light to the vitreous humour. The vitreous humour forms the greatest part of the eye; the crystalline lens is received into a depres- sion on its anterior surface; and posteriorly, and late- rally, the retina is expanded on it. It is composed of a watery fluid, enclosed in cells; and the whole is sunnounted by a membrane, called, timica hyaloidea vitrea, vel aranea. The vitreous humoor collects the rays of light, in their transmission fi'om the lens to the retina. The pigmentum nigrum is secreted by the vessels of the choroid coat. Its use is to absorb the rays of light, which, if admitted to the retina in superfluous quantity, would cause confusion in vision.

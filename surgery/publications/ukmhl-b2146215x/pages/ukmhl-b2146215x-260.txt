234 lower aud middle regions of the neck, the student wUl pursue the course of the ailery towards the angle of the jaw, where it usually divides into two considerable branches, the internal, and external carotids; the internal enters the foramen carotidnni, to sui)ply the anterior part of the brain; the external furnishes branches to the neck, face, and scalp. With resjject to the place where the diyision of the common carotid takes place, it now and then varies, but generally it is said to divide opposite to the upper margin of the thyroid cartilage, a transverse line then drawn from this point, will be our guide to the seat of bifurcation. Before tracing the external carotid, and the branches which arise from it, the following parts of the basis of the jaw must be sought for: the inferior portion of the parotid gland; the digastricus, and the muscles which take their origin from the styloid pro- cess of the temporal bone; the submaxillaiy gland; absorbent glands; the mylo hyoideus; the hyoglossus, and the other muscles of the tongue; the sublingual gland; and the ducts of the salivaiy glands. The stu- dent is next to follow the nerves of this part, viz.â€”the glosso pharyngeal, the lingual, the nervus accesso- ritts Willisii, &c.; and deeper seated, he will find the par vagmn, and great sympathetic emerging from the cranium. The relative position of the external and internal carotids, with regard to each other, aud to the

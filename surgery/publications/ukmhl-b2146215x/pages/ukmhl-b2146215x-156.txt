132 are th6n, other parts composing- the retiua, besides the j)ulpy expansion of the nerve. The tunica sclerotica, the tunica choroides, and the retina, are the three perfect coats of the eye; The sclerotica is considered by some writers, to be a continuation of the dura mater, a thick membrane which lies immediately under the skull; and the cho- roides, a continuation of the pia mater, a fine thin tnembrane, which adheres closely to the brain. Galen, and all the old Anatomists, believed that the tunica sclerotica was a continuation of the dura mater; but most modern Anatomists do not think so ; nor do they believe that the tunica choroides is the product of the pia mater. The sclerotic coat is very much thicker and stronger than the dura mater, and there is nothing but the extreme vasculai-ity of the two membranes, that can identily the tunica choroides with the pia mater. The humours of the eye are three, viz.â€”the aqueous, the crystalline, and the vitreous^ The aqueous humour occupies the chambers of the eye; its source is the vessels of the iris. The clu-ystaUine lens, although commonly called a humoui-, is a solid double convex substance. Its anteiior surface, however, is more flattened than its posterior, which is received into a depression of the vitreous humour. The lens is confined in its situation

â€¢24 rossificalion; bnt in the irregular bones (as the vertebra?), there are several. If we examine a child at birth, the osseous system will be found extremely imperfect. The bones of the bead are more numerous than in the adult subject, and -very loosely united by means of membrane. When we carry our observation from the head of the child to the other bones, we see how incompletely they are ossified. The vertebrae are, in a great degree, cai-tila- ginous; only here and there are spots of ossific matter visible. The sternum is made up of pieces of bone, deposited in, and surrounded by cartilage. The edges of the bones of the pelvis ai-e tipped with cartilage. The tlu-ee bones of each os innominatiun, and the different pieces of the sacrum, are separated by inter- vening cartilages. The cylindrical bones are incom- plete; theii- ends are cartilaginous, and all their pro- cesses the same. Thus the osseous system at birth is very imperfect; although some of the bones are almost completely formed, seven, fourteen, twenty-one, and even twentj'-eight years will elapse, 'ere all the bones of the body attain theii- ultimate formation. At the twenty-first year, they are said to have finished their longitudinal growth; hence at this age, man arrives at his full statuie; but the bones increase laterally from that period up to the twenty-eighth or thirtieth yeai-, when not only the bones, but all the other struc- tures of the body are supposed to an-ive at their acme . of symmetry and perfection.

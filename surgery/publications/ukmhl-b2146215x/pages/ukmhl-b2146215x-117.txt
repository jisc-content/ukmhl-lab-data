93 tubuli for conveying the secreted fluid to its main cxcretoiy duct. But in tlie blood-vessels of the liver, there is this peculiarity; whUst other glands .are sup-, plied with arterial blood o«///,/this organ receives,, in addition to it, a lai-ge quantity of venous blood, through the medium of the vena - portae, a considerable vessel formed by the union of tjiose. veins which return the blood from the other chylopoietic viscera. It is supposed by many Physiologists, that the blood earned ta the liver by. the hepatic artery, is intended merely for the nourishment of the gland,, and that, the blood of the vena.portae is only for the biUary secretion; but a case related by Mi-. Abemethy, in tlie f Philosophical Transactions," proves that the blood of the ai-tery is subservient to both functions, The subject of the case referred to, was a child, in whom the vena portae terminated at once in the vena cava iiiferior, without approaching the liver; yet the child was well noui-ished; and, on examination after death, bile was found both in the gall-bladder and intestines. ■! The bile is carried from the liver by the hepatic duct; to the gall-bladder, by the cystic duct; and to the intestines, by the ductus communis choledochus. The uses of this fluid aa-e to assist in the chyliferous process, and to excite the peristaltic action of the intes- tines. It is found to consist of a resinous matter, albumen, salts of soda, lime, and oxide of iron.

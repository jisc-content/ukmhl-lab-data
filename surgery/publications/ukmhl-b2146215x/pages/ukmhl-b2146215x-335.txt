305 confined to the walls of the abdomen merely, we have less to fear than if the instrument had penetrated the cavity; for in this case the peritoneum would be injured, and most probably some of the viscera; but we are not too hastily to pronounce a favoui'able prog- nosis, even in Avounds not communicating with the cavity. If the integument only be incised, or punc- tured, the accident is trivial, and need not excite any alarm ; but when the aponeuroses of the abdominal muscles suffer, the case is alarming, as we know that injiu'ies of tendinous structures are not easily repaired. The issue may be inflammation, suppui'ation, and sloughing; if matter forms, it will burrow behind the aponeuroses, and we can now easily predict the conse- quences unless an exit is given to it by an artificial opening. The sti'ucture then of the anterior part of the parietes of the belly, renders the event of wounds of this part more dangerous than superficial wounds of the chest, and of almost equal danger with those of the coverings of the cranium. If the instrument has pierced the peritoneum, (and the viscera, by good fortune, have escaped injury), we have to apprehend, in addition to the preceding effects, that the peritoneum will inflame ; and that the inflammation will spread from the lining to the reflected portions of this membrane : we have here very formi- dable circumstances to combat; but these circum- stances are still more serious, vv^hen complicated with visceral wounds, fbr they may give rise to extravasa- '2 Q

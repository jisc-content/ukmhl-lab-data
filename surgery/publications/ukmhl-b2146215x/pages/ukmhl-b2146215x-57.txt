The bones of ihe' tace are united to those of the cranium, by the ti-ansverse, sphenoid, ethmoid, and zygomatic sutures; and to each other by sutures, named after their situa- tion,- and by concretions of substances, the lower jaw excepted, which has a moveable articulation. The student is much puzzled by a multiplication of the names of the sutures, in the way that some anatomists have adopted. I have endeavoured to simplify the study of them as much as possible; taking care at the same time not to waive any important point. The Trunk of the skeleton is composed of three pai-ts; the spine, thorax, and pelvis. The Spine is a column of small bones, twenty- four in number; and called vertebrae, from the Latin word, verto. They are divided into three classes, named cervical, dorsal, and lumbar. In the first class, there are seven bones; in the second, twelve; and in the third, five. The increase in size of these bones is gradual, from the first cervical to the last lumbar vertebra. The spinal column is articulated above, with the condyles of the os occipitis; and below, with the base of the'sacrum. Its form is curved; in the neck, it ! F

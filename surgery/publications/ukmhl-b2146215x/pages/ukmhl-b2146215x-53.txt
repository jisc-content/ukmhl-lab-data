29 all the vessels which injection shoAVs in it, ai'c not lor its nourislunent, as some of them go to supply the bone which it invests; it is principally by meaais ot vessels that the periostenm adheres to the bone. It has absorbents and nerves; but unless under the influence of disease, this structure is not endowed with a great share of sensibility. The periosteum serves two important uses, viz.— to give firm attachment to the muscles; and to sustain Ihe^branches of blood-vessels going to the bone. The membrana medullaiis lines the cavities, or . cancellated sta-ucture of bones. It is exceedingly 5,vascular, and secretes the marrow, which is said to be of the same use to the bone, as the fat is to the soft parts. Formerly, the diseases of bone were regarded as '<,f a peculiar kind, in very few respects resembling ■ those of the soft pai-ts; an error resulting from the ignorance of the Ancients, with regard to the true structure of this substance. Observation and chemistiy have, however, removed this obstacle to improvement : in Pathology. Seeing that bone is furnished with blood-vessels, absorbents, and nerves, we cannot be sm-prised at their liability to inflammation, and its consequences, viz.—increased exhalation, or effusion; suppuration; lUceration; and mortification. Seeing too, that an animal and earthy material enter into its

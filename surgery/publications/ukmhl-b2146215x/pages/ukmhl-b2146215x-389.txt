359 pushed by the finger between the vein, and pnbic side of the sheath, we produce an artificial hernia, and if the sac thus produced be distended with hair, the student may proceed with the dissection below Poupart's liga- ment, and observe how the hernial protrusion stands in its relation to other parts. Under the common integument, at the upper part of the thigh, we find the fascia superficialis, which we have already described as covering the inguinal glands j if this fascia be raised, we expose the fascia lata, which uniformly surrounds the muscles of the thigh, below the enti-ance of the vena saphena into the femo- ral'vein; but above that point, there are irregular appearances in it. The fascia lata is commonly said to consist of two portions ; an iliac, and a pubic; the former portion is attached to nearly the whole of Poupart's ligament, and has a crescentic edge, called the falciform process; the latter, which is much ' thinner in structure, is attached to the anterior edge of the pubis, and covers the muscles of the thigh which arise from that bone, viz.—the pectinaeus, and °'a.dductores. It is coutimied behind the femoral ves- ' isels, and unites with the outer portion. A little below ' Poupart's, or Fallopius' ligament, we see an oval opening, where the fascials defective, it is occupied by cellular membrane and lymphatic glands: on removing these, a part of the femoral vein is brought into view, and at the lower part of the oval space, the vena saphena major is observed, entering the femoral vein.

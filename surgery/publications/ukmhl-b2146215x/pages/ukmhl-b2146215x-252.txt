Mr. Burns mentions the case of a Avoman who had a tumour of the magnitude of a walnut on the side of the neck, which had a strong pulsation, owing to the action of the carotid under- neath ; several who saw it, and who satisfied them- selves with a supei-ficial examination, firmly heUeved it to be aneiu-ism, but it proved to be nothing more than an enlai-ged gland. Mr. Burns thinks that some of the reputed cases of aneurism in which spontaneous recovery took place, had been merely glandular tu- mours placed over the course of a large artery, and receiving an impulse from the vessel beneath. It is not only in the neck that an enlarged gland in the coiuse of an artery, may lead to a dangerous diagnosis; therefore we should carefully examine the â€¢swelling before giving a positive opinion as to its nature. The pulsation may ai-ise not only from the gland being situated over a lai-ge artery, but fi-om a branch of an artery passing over the tumour. To discriminate between aneurism and the former case, the tumour should be puUed forwards, so as to be removed from the sphere of action of the arteiy; on doing this, all pulsation will cease if the tumour be merely glandular. To decide betAveen aneurism and the latter case; if aneurism, the pulsation is general; if a glandiUar tumour, the pulsation is only partial, or confined to a particular part of the swelling.

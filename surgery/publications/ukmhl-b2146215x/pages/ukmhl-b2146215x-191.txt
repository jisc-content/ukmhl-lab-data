At first, all men feel more or less anxiety, however gi'eat their anatomical knowledge may be; and often, this continues tlu'oughout their professional life. I shall here give what Richerand, a distinguished operative Surgeon of the French School says, on this subject, and as the j^assage comprehends what I wish to impress on the mind of the student, viz.—how confidence is most likely to be acquii-ed, I shall, with his words, conclude these introductory remarks.

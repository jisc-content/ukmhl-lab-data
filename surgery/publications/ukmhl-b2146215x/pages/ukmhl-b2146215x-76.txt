52 their functions. There are two facts in favour of the musculai-ity of these vessels; lirst, the power which they have, of accepting, or rejecting the fluids which are offered to them; proving that their action is not dependent on mere capillary attraction; and secondly, the increased energy of their function, on the appli- cation of such stimuli as-excite the activity of muscular parts in general. The inner, or third coat is the strongest; and to it, is owing the superior strength of the absorbent vessels, in comparison with the strength of veins; the former being able to bear a column of mercury, under which, the latter woidd immediately burst. The three tunics are furnished with arteries, veins, absorbents, and nerves. By coloiu-ed size injection, the arteries may be shown; besides which, disease proves to us theii- existence; for when an absorbent is inflamed, we see a red line indicating its course, and resulting from a turgid state of its parietal vessels. The presence of absorbents is more conjec- tural; but that of nerves is manifested by the acute- â€¢ ness of the sensibiHty of these vessels, when in an inflamed state. Absorbents have valves, like veins; but in the former, the valves are universal; in the latter, they are limited to the veins of the extremities, and to pai-ts where pressure may interfere with the circulation of the blood. The valves are directed towards the

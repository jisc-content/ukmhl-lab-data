In the abdomen, near the trunk of the cceliac artery, we see the semilunar ganglion. Between the cceliac and superior mesenteric arteries, are several small ganglia, named, tlie cceliac ganglia. Near this part, we find numerous nervous filaments, crossing and re-crossing each other, and forming a compli- cated net work, which has been called, the solar plexus; fi'om this point, branches go olf to the prin- cipal viscera of the abdomen and pelvis, and each set of branches is termed a plexus; thus, we have the hepatic plexus; the superior mesenteric plexus; the renal, or emulgent plexus; the spermatic plexus ; the inferior mesenteric plexus; and the hypogasti-ic plexus. There is scarcely a part in the body, that may not be drawn into a sympathetic consent with this dif- fused and beautiful system of nerves. Its junctions, by means of ganglia, with the cerebral, and spinal nerves, offer an easy solution of this fact. Th'^e nerves which go off f rom the spinal mar- row, are thirty-one pairs, which are divided into nine

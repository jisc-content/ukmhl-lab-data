120 explain some of the painful sensations which women experience in the progress of parturition. The nerves are the auxiliary instruments of sen- sation, and voluntary motion; but the manner in which these functions ai-e performed is still doubtful. An interesting theoi^ has recently been advanced by Mr. C. Bell, upon the functions of nerves; I shall present it in brief to the reader. The common opmion entertained is, that the nerves are a series of tubes, which transmit to the different structures of the body, a power, which is secreted by the brain ; but as Ana- tomy cannot demonstrate the nei*ves as tubular, Mr. Bell thinks, that the theory is not compatible with our real knowledge of the structural arrangement of nei-ves. Many parts are more abundantly supplied with nerves than others, and it has been supposed that this was necessary, because they stood m need of a more bountiful provision of nervous energy; but Mr. Bell is of opinion, that the hypothesis is fallacious. He says, however perfect the enjoyment of any sense, or however exquisite the fmiction of any part may be, one nerve is sufficient to bestow the power; that, for one pui-pose, no more than one nerve is requii-ed; and that the accumulation of many nerves to augment the power, or improve the fmiction, is as untiue in fact, as it is unphilosophical in theory. When a part is supplied with many nerves, it is for the pui-pose (Mr. Bell thinks) of enabling the organ to perform many offices, or to connect it with different operations of the

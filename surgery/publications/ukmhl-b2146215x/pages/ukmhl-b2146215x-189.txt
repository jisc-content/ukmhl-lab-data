ON RELATIVE POSITION; oil MEDICO-CHIRURGICAL VIEWS OF THE HUMAN BODY. After the general description of the human body, which has been given in stiict physiological order, it is proper to consider the grouping together of parts; and thus to describe their support and con- nections. This constitutes the study of Relative Posi- tion; a subject which has an influence on all the steps which are taken, in the planning and performance of the different operations of surgery. We have seen that there are different systems of parts in the human body; but to study them sepa- rately, is only admissible, as introductory to other im- portant points; afterwards, the student must observe the relations which they have to each other, and the manner in which they are linked together; for it is principally by observing them united, that he will gain the knowledge which can render him competent to practise his profession with success and safety.

2 S 3^r The stiuleut Is to traee the subclifvian artery on both sides of the neck, as the difference in origin occasions varieties in the course, and length of the vessels. To obtain a vicAV of its first part, the clavi- cular portion of the sterno cleido must be raised; the par vagum will then appear before the artery, and just behind the sternal extremity of the clavicle; anterior to the artei-y, is the subclavian vein; and connected with the vein and artery, are the recurrent nerve, thoracic duct, and other important parts. The artery on the right side arises fi'om the arteiia innominata; it is more superficial than the left, shorter by the' length of the arteria innominata, and more direct in its course. The left takes its origin irom the arch of the aorta, it passes, first vertically upwards, and then suddenly bends outwards; but the course of both arteries is the same, after they have passed between the scalenus anticus, and medius muscles; each arteiy then begins to descend to the axilla, having the plexus of nerves above and rather behind it, and the subcla- vian vein before, but separated from the artery by the scalenus anticus muscle. Having emerged from under the clavicle, the subclavian loses its name, and becomes the axdlaiy arteryr Having studied the relations of the subclavian ' aiteiy, and the branches which are sent oflP fi-om it, viz,â€”^the internal mammary, the superior intercostal, the vertebral, the inferior thyroideal, the supra sca- pular, and the cervical, which are very variable in

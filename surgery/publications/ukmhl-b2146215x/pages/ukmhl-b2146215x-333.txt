303 being nearly horizontal, becomes preternaturally curved. On the contrary, the uterus, instead of rising, sometimes falls, as in prolapsus and inversio uteri, in which cases the urethra is dragged in a direc- tion downwards. Other circumstances may occasion a distoition of the urethra, as malformed pelvis, extreme corpulency, &c.; the cause must lead us to suspect the course which the urethra has taken, and the introduction of the catheter performed accordingly. A side view of the pelvic viscera in the female is to be obtained in the same way as in the male; the urinary bladder is to be inflated, and the vagina and rectum stuffed with hair, or tow. The student will observe the ureter on the left side; the bladder, behind the pubes; the uterus, its appendages, and vagina, behind the bladder; and the rectum, posterior to the whole. In this view of parts, the remarkable inflec- tions of the peritoneum will be very apparent. The urethra will be observed to be about one inch in length, and in its course under the arch of the pubes, to describe a slight ciu-vature, the concavity of which is upwards. The meatus urinarius, or external opening, is situated just under the symphysis pubis, and a little above the orificium vaginae. At its extre- mity, it has a button-like projection, which, in the the living subject, is perceptible to the touch; but in

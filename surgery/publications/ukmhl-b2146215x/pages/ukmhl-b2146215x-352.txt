322 tlieir origin aiid course; the next points for considerai tion are, the practicability of passing a ligature about it, and the cases requiring the operation. The safety of cutting down upon the artery, in order to tie it between the heart and scaleni muscles, is to be ques- tioned, on account of the proximity of the vessel to many very important parts; but that it may be tied without much risk, after it has passed the scaleni muscles, many successful cases bear witness. The exteiTial incision is to divide the skin imme- diately above the clavicle, from the outer edge of the clavicular portion of the sterno cleido muscle, to the margin of the clavicular insertion of the trapezius. On the edges of this incision being sepai-ated, the fibres of the platysma myoides will be exposed; these are to be cut through with caution, lest the external jugular vein, which lies immediately under it, should be wounded; the jugular vein is, by means of a blunt hook, to be di-awn to the outer side, the celliUar mem- brane carefully separated with the handle of the scalpel, and the artery felt for, which has the cervical nerves of the axillai-y plexus above, and the subclavian vein below it. The vessel lies deep, and therefore some difficulty has occasionally been experienced in passmg a ligature about it; this has induced Desault, Mr. Ramsden, and other Surgeons, to conti-ive instru- ments, by which this part of the operation may be facilitated. Not very long ago, Mr. Weiss, an inge- nious surgical instrument-maker in the Strand, con-

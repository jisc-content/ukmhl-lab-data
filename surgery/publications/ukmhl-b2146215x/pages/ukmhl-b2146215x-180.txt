156 We have examined all the organs neccssiary to the support of life; but as death is the certain conse- tjuence of life, the human species would soon bc-jome extinct; if there were not functions subservient to its continuance. There are few persons who attain the age of three score years and ten, because there are many causes which have a tendency to curtail the thread of human life. The desire of longevity (as Willich observes) seems to be inherent in all animated natui-e; and particularly in the human race. It is intimately cherished by us tlu-oughout the whole of our existence, and is frequently supported and sti-engthened, not only by justifiable means, but also by various species of collusion; but, in spite of the desire, how few there are who live to be old; partly from, causes of our own creation, partly from casualties, and pai-tly from diseases to which the different periods of life pecu- liarly predispose us. In infancy, the convulsions attendant on dentition, hydrocephalus, the hooping cough, the measles, scarlet fever, and small-pox, commit great havoc ; thus, it has been computed that one-half of the children born in London, die under the age of two years and three quarters; and in Man- chester, under five; but the mortality of the infantile period of life has been greatly diminished by the dis- covery of the immortal J cnner. In the middle stages of life, infiiimmatory dis-

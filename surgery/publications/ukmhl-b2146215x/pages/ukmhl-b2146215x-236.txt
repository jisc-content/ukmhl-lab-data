210 fauces, and of the praclicability of passiiiij a prop'.-rly curved bougie, or hollow flexible lube, into the laryux, and pharynx, from the nose; this knowledge is of gi'eater unportance, as it respects the former, than the latter operation, because in a case of sus- pended animation it supersedes the necessity of la- ryngotomy, or tracheotomy ; as a tube cannot be made to enter the larynx from the mouth, but may, under all circumstances, be introduced with facility from the mouth into the oesophagus. But to perform these operations, the Surgeon must be well acquainted with the mechanism of the Jjarts concerned in deglutition. After a poition of food has been masticated, it is formed into a bolus, and placed on the dorsum of the tongue; in swallowing that morsel, the tongue recedes in the mouth, the effect of which is to press the epig- lottis down upon the opening of the glottis, and thus to prevent the food from entering the trachea. The tongue then is the preventive agent, and of this we can readily convince ourselves, by cai-rying it back- wards, and forwards : in the former case, the epiglottis falls flat on the rima glottidis; and if we di-aw the tongue from the mouth, the epiglottis is raised, and the orifice of the glottis exposed. When it is our wish to pass a tube from the right nostril into the trachea to inflate tlie lungs, our first aim must be to open the larynx, this is done by pulling the tongue from the mouth; but if we want to pass a tube from the nose, or mouth, into the pharynx, we should push the tongue back to prevent the possibility of its

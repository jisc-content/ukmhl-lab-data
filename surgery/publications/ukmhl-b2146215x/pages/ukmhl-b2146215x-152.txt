128 on the same appearance as tlie- iris, ami presaits the same arrangement of particles. 3.â€”In most birds, and in many of the mam- malia, as in the quadi-umanous and canine animals, numerous nei-ves can readily be demonstrated pro- ceeding to the ciliary muscle, and distributed through- out its substance. Ligaments, on the coutrarj', are very spaiingly supplied with nei-ves. If the ciliary ligament be really muscular, it may be accessary to such a fimction, by changing the situation of the crystalline lens. The globe of the eye is made up of coats and humours, and certain appendages to each. It is nearly spherical in form; indeed, would be exactly so, if the sphere were not interrupted by the gi-eater convexity of the transparent cornea. The humours, and the other delicate pai'ts of the eye, are enclosed in a dense membrane, called, the tunica sclerotica; anteriorly, it receives the cornea, which is ti-ansparent, and may, by maceration, be separated from the sclerotic coat; posteriorly, it is pierced by the optic nei-ve, which enters at the iimer part of the optic axis; this axis being defined by drawing a central line fi-om the anterior to the poste- rior surface of the eye.

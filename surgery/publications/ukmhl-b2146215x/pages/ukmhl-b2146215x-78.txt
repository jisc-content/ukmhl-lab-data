absorb, an excessive growth, and a tendency to .effiision, will be induced. When the exhalations in the dilferent circumscribed cavities, and cellular mem- brane, are greater than the power of the lymphatics can overcome, dropsical accumulations must take place; producing, in the head, hydrocephalus; in the chest, hydrothorax; in the abdomen, ascites; and in the cellular membrane, anasarca. The preceding remarks will serve to illustrate the uses of the absorbent system, in preventing a preternatural increase of solids, or fluids; thereby in averting disease, and modelling the growth of the body. But the absorbent system is an efficient means, in tte hands of the Physician, and Sui'geon, as it can be made subservient to the cure of disease. The lacteals are the most limited part of this system; their use is, to transmit the chyle from the intestines to the thoracic duct. The lymphatics, constituting the major part, arise from three sources, viz.â€”the extenial surface of the body, and cellular membrane under the skin; from the different cavities, as the head, thorax, abdo- men, and pelvis; and from the surfaces and substance^ of all the organs of the body. We know the property^ which mercury, and some other medicines, possess,, of augmenting the action of the ijiternal absorbents; hence, we employ these remedies in many diseases;^ but we can best excite the energy of the lymphatics^. by administering medicine through the medium of cutaneous friction. The surface of the .body is

Ill it must not be believed, that any one can be a good Physiologist without being a good Anatomist, for the two sciences are mutually dependent; it is therefore absolutely necessary, that they should be studied in conjunction. But the ultimate object of these useful pursuits, is hot to be attained without combining Pathology with them ; for this is the grand focus, in which the enlightening rays, which emanate fi-om Anatomy and Physiology, converge. Anatomy, alone, is important W'the Painter, and Sculptor, as it enables them, ac- curately, to delineate the varieties in the contour of the limbs, and trunk, caused by the action, or repose of muscles; united to Physiology, it displays the most interesting views to the mind, and tends, in a great dte'^eeV 't6 expand the scope of the understanding; but if these were all the uses of Anatomy, the science ivduld not have merited one half of the attention which has been bestowed upon it by those who have assidu- ously' cultivated it, from the earliest ages of the world. In competition with Pathology, every other ap- plication of Anatomy is, comparatively, insignificant; for what eaithly possession is there, we value so much as liealth? Hence, what can be equal to that science

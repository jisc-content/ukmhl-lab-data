131 U-actiou and dilatation, the most prevalent, and pi^o- bable opinion is, that it is in part, if not wholly .nuscula.-. Some have supposed, that the dimumtxon and expansion may be explained by the changes which the vascular structui-e of the iris experiences from saaiguineous determination; thus, when the retina is impressed with a too vivid light, blood is determined to tie iris in an increased quantity, by which the vessels are distended, and the aperture of the pupil encroached on; but when the stimulus is withdiawn the blood recedes, and the pupil resumes its original size Blumenbach thinks, that the dilatation and con- ti-action neither depend on muscularity, nor vascularity, but on a " vita propria;" to which term it is not easy to attach a precise meaning. Analogy, and the cir- cmnstances which affect the pupU, must inchne us to the opinion, that the iris is muscular; after death it, like all the muscles of the body, is in a state of relax- ation, the pupU is consequently dilated; and when, from other causes, muscular action is suspended, or ^veakened, we find the state of the iris to correspond. Under the choroid coat, is the third tunic, which is called the retina, it embraces, as it were, the vitreous humour. To say, that the retina is the expansion of the optic nei-ve, is not anatomically correct; for minute researches have shown, that the nervous pulp is situated between two timics; the external one, named, tunica Jacobi, in honour of the discoverer; the internal, the timica vasculosa; there

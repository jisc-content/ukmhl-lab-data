74 in quantity by respiration, and that the Carbonic acid gas is increased. In Blumenbach's Physiology, there is a note, giving the results of some experiments, made with, a view to determine how long an animal can breathe the same air without dying. For these expe- riments, three dogs were obtained, of equal size and strength. To the trachea of the first dog, a bladder was tied by means of a tube, and this bladder con- tained about twenty cubic inches of oxygen gas; the animal died in fourteen minutes. In the second case, the bladder was filled with atmospberic air; the animal died in six minutes. In the thii-d, the carbonised air, expired by the second dog, was employed; and the animal died in four minutes. On examining the air of the bladder, after each experiment, it gave the com- mon signs of carbonic acid gas, viz.â€”it extinguished flame, and precipitated lime fi-om lime-water. Find- ing, tben, that carbon is emitted fi-om the hmgs, and oxygen consumed, it is certain that we cannot remain any great length of time in a confined place, without suflPering inconvenience, and even death, if the stay be protracted beyond a certain period; because the atmosphere is deteriorated, by being surcharged with a gas, which is destructive of animal life. It is natui-al, then, to ask, how the air is again purified? From what sources the oxygen is obtained? and by what process the carbonic acid gas is destroyed? We may briefly answer these questions, by stating, that the salutary renovation is principally owing -to the vegetation of plants. Priestley proved by

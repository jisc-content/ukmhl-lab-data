298 near which, the ducts of the vesiculae seminales, vasa deferentia, and prostate gland open. It is necessary that the cui-vatures of the urethra should be known; also the situation of the dilated and contracted parts of it: the curvatures, in order that we may give to a catheter the proper bend; the dilatatibns and contrac- tions, in order to avoid mistaking a natural for a morbid straightening of the passage, an error which has occasionally happened. We might with propriety make, in this place, some observations on the inti-o- duction of the catheter, sound, and bougie; but in a general way, the operation only requii-es a know- ledge of the Anatomy of the ui-ethra, to ensure its easy accomplishment. If a comparison be made between the pelvis of the male, and that of the female, obvious differ- ences will be seen, both in capacity and form. The ilia are more expanded in the latter, the brim is more oval, the cavity more capacious, and the outlet larger; but the depth of the pelvis is less in the female subject than in the male. In an obstetilc point of view, it is necessary to bear in mind the depth of the pelvic cavity in its different parts; behind, it measures in the standard pelvis, from five to six inches; anteriorly, about two inches; and laterally, from three inches and a half to four inches. In the dimensions given of the brim, cavity, and outlet, the student shotild consider whether it is under-

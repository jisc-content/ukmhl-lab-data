287 If we have studied the characteristics of inflam- mation in general, we shall seldom be at a loss in detecting its presence; but inflammation of certain organs offers varieties which must be understood. The state of the pulse is in most cases a criterion; but there are exceptions to this rule. In gastritis and enteritis the pulse is unlike to that in hepatitis; in the two first, it is small and frequent; in the last, tense and strong; but in both these cases, copious depletion is indicated. The pain too varies according to the seat of inflammation, particularly in such organs as the liver, and lungs. When the investing membrane is affected, the pain is much more acute, than when the parenchyma, or substance of the organ, is the seat of disease; the unyielding and compact nature of membranous structure is probably the cause of this fact. In parenchymatous inflammation the pain is dull and heavy, and this is the symptom which marks the difference betvveen it, and inflammation of the envelo- ping membrane. ' A change of structure in the mesenteric glands, accompanied by obstruction, is productive of a morbid phenomenon, of much importance to be known. We have said, in another part of the volume, that the lacteals, in theii- course from the small intestines to the thoracic duct, pass through these bodies; it is obvious then, that if they should be disorganized, and obstructed by disease, the nourishing product of the

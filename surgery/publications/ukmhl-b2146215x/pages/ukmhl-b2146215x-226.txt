The principle is to close not only.,tl\e JU)tei;ioi;, but the jposterior opening. ■- To plug up the posterior narine aperture, a ,,,ptheter, bougie, or probe with a piece of string, at- tached to its extremity, must be passed along the floor of the nostril, until it appears in the fauces behind the curtain of the palate. The string is then to be laid hold of by means of along diessing forceps, and drawn out of the mouth. A dossil of lint or sponge is to be tied to it, and by withdi-awing the bougie from the nosti-il, the plug will be carried to the posterior aper- ture ; this will prevent the escape of blood backwai'ds. ,^The anterior opening is then to be well closed; and thus the blood, confined in the nostril between the two plugs, coagulates, and mechanically obstaructs the bleeding vessels. The pituitary membrane of the nose is also called Schneiderian membrane, because Schneider first ac- curately described it. The ancients believed that the membrane was perforated in different places, in order to give exit to the mucus of the nose, which they erroneously thought wss secreted by the glandulai'- like body which occupies the sella tm-cica of the ■ sphenoid bone, and in conformity to that supposition, they named it " Glandula Pituitaria," a name still ..retained; but the fact is, that there is no direct com- ^ munication by any such apertures, for the small body 'mentioned has nothing to^dOimtli;the; mucu^,,o^ .th^

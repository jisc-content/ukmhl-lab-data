295 rectum, and attaches this portion of intestine to the venter sacri, by a process called meso-rectum. The neck of the bladder, then, and inferior part of the rectum, are not covered with peritoneum; there is left a triangular space, the apex of which is formed by the prostate gland, and the sides by the vesiculae seminales; it is in this space that we puncture the bladder from the rectum, in retention of urme, where less formidable means have been had recourse to with- out effect. The opening is made in a dependent situa- tion, and without the risk of wounding the peritoneum. The perinaeum is now to be dissected. In reflect- ing the integuments, the student must pay attention to the dense fascia of tlus part, which is the cause of the disti-essing consequences of a suppuration in perinaeo, and explains why abscesses, in this situation, are so mucti disposed to become fistulous. When matter forms, it cannot easily determine itself to the surface, on account of the great thickness of the anterior wall of the abscess; the pus, therefore, burrows amongst the loose cellular membrane, and gives rise to extensive mischief. To obviate this effect, it is required that we should make an early opening with a lancet. Having exposed the muscles of the perinaeum, the arteries, the bulb of the m-ethra, the membranous por- tion of the canal, the prostate gland, and the connec- tion of all these parts to the rectum; the student must apply his Anatomy to surgical purposes. He must

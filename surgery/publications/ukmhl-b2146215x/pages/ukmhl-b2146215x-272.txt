246 adviseable to push the foreign body into tlie stomach ; or if adviseable, it may not be practicable to do so: in the former case, we must endeavour to draw it out; and in the latter, the operation of cesophagotomy affords the only chance of saving life. If the relation of parts in the space bounded by the trachea and oesophagus on the inner side, and the inner edge of the sterno cleido on the outer, be recollected by the student, he will have no difficulty in stating what are the parts to be avoided by the knife; the carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and par vagum, are shielded by the condensed celliUar sheath which surrounds them. There are two arteries in danger of being Avounded, viz.â€”the infe- rior thyroideal, which is a branch of the subcla- vian; and the superior thyroideal, wliich is sent off from the external carotid. The first of these arteries bends behind the sheath of the vessels, and passes in an oblique direction upwards, towards the inferior portion of the thyroid gland, on which it ramifies; the course of the superior thyi-oideal artery has an equal degree of obliquity downwaids, but it is more tortuous than the inferior; it expends itself on the upper por- tion of the thyroid gland; but neither of these vessels need be interfered with, for the one is below, and the other above the place of the incision ; besides fm-ther safety is given by our discontinuing to use the cutting edge of the knife after the deeper seated pai-ts have

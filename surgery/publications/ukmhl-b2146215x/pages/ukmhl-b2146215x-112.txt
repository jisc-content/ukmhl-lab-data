88 braiies, In these organs, the lu-rangeraent pt^ the secreting apparatus is simple. The arteries terminate in two ways; in pores, and veins. The fluid secreted by the capillai-y vessels, exudes through the pores; and the veins return the superfluous quantity of blood. Of the second kind, are those small glandular bodies contained within the mucous membrane of the different passages; and we may class with them the sebaceous follicles; here the secretory appai-atus is less simple. Between the terminations of the arteries, and the commencement of the veins, there is an arrangement of parts, more nearly approaching to that of complex glands. Of the third kind, are those glands which, con- stitute some of the important organs of the body; as the salivaiy glands, the liver, the pancreas, the Iddnies, the testes, and the mammee. In these organs, the pai-enchyma is peculiai-Iy complicated; because the fluids which they secrete, are of a compound nature, and some of them differing essentially fi-om the blood. The screted fluids of the body may thus be classed, in conformity with the organs to which they respec- tively belong: A. —The fluids of the organs of loco-motion. B. _The fluids of the serous membranes of the tlu-ee grand cavities. C. —The fluids of the digestive organs. ,

325 In the operation of taking up the axillary artery, tlie iirst incision is to be commenced about an inch from the sternal end of the clavicle, and carried to- wai-ds the coracoid process of the scapula; some of the clavicular fibres of the pectoralis muscle are to be subsequently divided, the cellular membrane under- neath pushed aside with the handle of the scalpel, and by the same means the artery exposed. We have now to consider the connections of the artery, in the depth of the arm pit, a pyramidal cavity occupied by blood vessels, nerves, absorbent glands, much fat, and cellular membrane. Tn this space, the artery will be seen surrounded by the plexus of nerves, and most difficult to reach, without injury to other parts. In the tj'ing of this vessel, and the extirpation of glands from the axilla, the operations are to be ex- ecuted with as little use of the blade of the knife as possible, after the incision through the integument has been made. When the artery has passed the tendons of the pectoralis major, and latissimus dorsi muscles, it takes the name of brachial artery; which vessel de- scends on the inside of the arm, to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the ulnar and radial branches. At the upper part of the arm it is covered anteriorly by the coraco brachialis muscle, but dm-ing the rest of its course, it lies on the inner edge of the biceps, accompanied by the brachial vein, sometimes

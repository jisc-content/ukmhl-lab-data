340 ing from the ring, and the upper part of the thigh^ is called the fascia supcrficialis. It is a structure not confined to the groin; but here, and in other portions of the bodj', it is thicker, more membranous, and deserving of particular notice, from its relation to herniae, and suppurating buboes. The fascia superfcialis is to be separated from the aponeurosis which it covers, and reflected in a similar way to the skin; this will expose the glisten- ing tendon, its tennination in Poupart's ligament, the upper portion of the fascia lata of the thigh, and the inguinal glands; and the student will easily under- stand, after observing the situation of the superficial fascia above the inguinal glands, why it is, that abscesses in tlie groin ai-e long in bm-sting; for the fascia thickens from pressure, and oiFers great resis- tance ; and why, if allowed to open spontaneously, a sinuous ulcer is often left, Avhich is troublesome to heal. The common skin, and fascia just described, are then the superficial parts of the inguinal region. J The portion of aponemosis, which stretches from the superior spinous process of the ilium to the sym- physis pubis, is next to be examined. It is called Poupart's ligament, and at its pubic extremity, there is an opening, formed by a separation of the tendinous fibres, and named the external abdominal ring, in contradistinction to another aperture, by and by to be described, which is the internal ring. If the student

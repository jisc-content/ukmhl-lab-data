133 by a capsule, which is most probably derived from that of the vitreous hiunoui'. The thii-d humour of the eye, is the vitreoils, which forms the principal bulk of the globe; its con- sistence is gelatinous, from its being made up of cells and water, which are surrounded by a capsule, named, the tunica hyaloidea, vel aranea. At the edge of the crystalline lens, this tunic is said to divide into two laminae; one lamina gives an anterior covering to the lens ; the other passes behind it. By this separation of the membrane, a canal is formed, called the Petitian canal, which may be inflated by meatis of a blow-pipe. These are the principal facts jconnected with the coats and humours of the eye. The arteries of the appendages of this organ are the internal angular, or nasal; the rami lachrymales; and muscular branches; those of the tunics, are the arteria centralis retinae, and the ciliary branches. The arteries terminate in veins, and some of them in exhalent orifices. The nerves are, the motor oculi; the nervus patheticus; the opthalmic branch of the nervils trigeminus; and the optic, which expands into the retina.

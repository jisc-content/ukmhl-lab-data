1-25 levator raises it; the depressor directs it towards the o rouiid; and to give degrees of obliquity to it, there Ire two oblique muscles. The four first of these muscles are, by some Anatomists, called the " recti when they act iu succession, the eye is rolled in its socket; but when all are inaction at the same time, the globe is fixed. Mr. C. Bell communicated to the " Royal Society," in 1823, a Paper on cei-tain motions of the â€¢eve, which have hitherto been undescribed. Thus, every time the eye-lids are brought together, to cover the globe, the eye turns iipwai'ds; Avithout which motion, it woidd not be properly moistened, nor the particles of dust removed from its surface. Dm-ing sleep, the ball is turned upwards, so as to lodge under the superior lid. These movements are rapid and involuntary, while others are under the govern- ment of the will; and for the purpose of directing the eye to different objects. Hitherto, both the oblique, and the straight muscles, have been regai'ded as volun- tary ; but Mr. Bell maintains, that the oblique are for the performance of the insensible motions; and the recti, for those mider the command of volition. That the functions of these muscles are inseparably con- nected with the retina, and cease to act when it becomes insensible, while the obliqvie muscles come into play, and di'aw the pupil upwards, beneath the upper eye-lid. Hence that turning of the eye-ball which we witness in sleep, in fainting, or in death, is but the indication of insensibility.

3W ligament. And thirdly,, that species v(here the l>one^ is broken through the ti-ochanter major, beyond its ^ juiiction with the cei-vix femoris. Between the three j kinds, he makes this important distinction; in the first, no re-union will take place; hut the two last will admit of union, like fractures of other bones. Sir Astley qualifies the opinion that he has given, by say- ing, that if, in the first place, a bony union ever does happen, it is an exti-emely rare occm-rence, and that he has not yet met with a single example of it. The reasons which he assigns for the absence of ossific imion in the transverse fracture the capsular,. ii'f ligament, are these: '.ist;=^The want of proper apposition of the bones; _, for if-the broken extremities, in any part of the body, ^ be kept much asimder, ossific union is prevented. 2ndly.â€”The want of pressure of one bone upon the other, even where the length of the limb is pre- served: This will operate in preventing union, in cases Tvhere the capsular ligament is not torn, in con- sequence of the secretion of a quantity of fluid into the joint, from increased determination of blood to the capsular ligament; this distends the ligament, and thus entirely prevents the contact of the bones, by pushing the upper eiid Of the thigh-bone, from the .^^ acetabulum. ^^ T^^ T^iaifrdJ^^d^'priMi^iiJariea^n'^^ 3UO

.313 Ibllowing" remarks on their conjoint actions mnst be attended to. From the manner in which the clavicle and scapula are articulated, it is obvious that they can be raised, or depressed, pulled forwards, or drawn back- wards. The muscles which raise them are, the levator scapulae, and the superior fibres of the trapezius; those which depress them are, the pectoralis minor, sub- clavius, and serrattis magnus; and they serve to pull them forwards. Those which di-aw the scapula, con- sequently the clavicle backwards, are, the rhomboidei, and transverse fibres of the ti*apezius; and by its influence ou the os brachii, the latissimus dorsi would contribute rather powerfully to produce this motion. These four actions may be called direct, because there are specific muscles to perform them; but there are others of a combined nature; that is to say, requiring for their performance, a combination or alternation of forces; thus, if two opposite muscles act at the same time, the clavicle and scapula would neither be drawn in one direction, nor in the other, but would be inter- mediately fixed, if the actiug muscles be equally anta- gonized: the conjoint actions of muscles produce what may be called compound movements. If there be an alternate action of muscles, the bones jjartially revolve upon their axis; the scapula is i-aised by the upper fibres of the trapezius and levator scapulae, and depressed by the serratus niujor anticus; thus, these muscles are rotators of the scapula. 2 R

123 of the eye, and connects the appendages with the globe. The hichrymal apparatus consists of the gland, pnncta, caruncle, sac, and ductus ad nasum. The gland, which is situated in a depression behind the external augular process of the os frontis, secretes the tears, which are carried fi-om. it by meBz^s of several small ducts, which open on the surface of the tunica conjunctiva. The teai's, after moistening tlie surface of the eye, are dii-ected by the carmicle, or thai; small red body seen at the inner comer, into the puncta lachrymalia, whicht erminates in the lachi7mal sac; and from this sac the tears are conveyed into the nose. Although the laclirymal gland is allowed by all Physiologists, to be one source of tliis fluid, which lubricates the eye, Portal thinks that it is not the only one; for he believes that the arterial extremities of the tunica conjunctiva exhale a part of it. He says, in his Anatomy, " Nous ne nierons pas qv? utie partie de la liqueur lachrymale, ne provienne du corps, ou de la glande lachrymale; nous dirons cependant que c'est de la conjonctive que decoule la plus quantite de cette Jmmeur: elle Â«' ejf^hale des extremiUs arterielles, et est reprise en partie pas les vaisseaux hjmphatiques, ou ahsorbans: Ze' reste coiile dans les points lachnjmaux, d' ou elle parvient dans le nez." That the tunica conjunctiva is an absorbing and secreting membrane, is very probable; but that the fluid which it secretes, is analogous to that of the jachrymal gland, we have no proof. If M. Portal means to off'er as such, that " an increased sensibility

219 power, as to be inefficiently antagonized by the mnscles on the opposite side of the vertebral column; and that the spme Avonld thns be laterally curved, and remain so until means ai-e employed to equalize mus- culai- action. By Physiology we are taught, that the spine is kept erect by the equal and regulai- action of the muscles, situated on each side of the vertebrae; if then the spine is bent laterally, the action of the muscles cannot be equal, and that to render them so, must be one of the indications of cui-e. Mr. Grant of Bath, communicated to the late Mr. Wilson, that he had proposed to remove the late- ral incm-vation of the spine, by placing a weight on the head of the patient, on the principle of causmg a regular and equal action of the vertebral muscles. The practice struck Mr. Wilson as founded on just physiological principles, and he soon made a trial of it with a success which exceeded his most sanguine expectations. Mr. Wilson tried the plan in many in- stances during the last sixteen years of his life, and in no one instance, where it was properly persevered in, did he find it to fail in preventing the further pro- gress of the disease ; and in many it effected a perfect cure, at least so perfect, that no deformity was per- ceived, nor inconvenience in other respects suffered. The weight to be carried, must of course, be re- gulated by the age and strength of the patient.

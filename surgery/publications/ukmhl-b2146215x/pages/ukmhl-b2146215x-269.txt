243 roideal aitenes aiise by a common truuk from the rio-ht subclavian artery. The vessel creeps up the side of the ti-achea, lower than the gland, and when it has reached the front of the wind-pipe, it divides into two branches. It is well to beai- the possibility of these maldistributions of the arteries in mind, as it enforces the necessity of care, and tliat in the operation of ti-acheotomy, it is safer to lay down the knife after the crucial incision has been made, and to expose the rings of the trachea with the fingers, than to run the risk of being aimoyed by an unexpected hcemorrhage. If a vessel be wounded, of coiu-se it must be secured by ligature, before an opening be made into the wind-pipe. The presence of foreign bodies in the trachea, is not the only case which may require either of these ope- rations. In the Thiid Volume of the " Transactions of the Association of Fellows and Licentiates of the King's, and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland,'' there is an account of a case of cynanche laiyngea, by R. Carmichael, Esq. in which ti-acheotomy was per- formed with success; and in the Seventy-seventh Number of the " Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal," there are two instances related by IMr. Lis- lon, in which the same operation was required, and fully succeeded. One was a case of cedema glottidis, a disease described by Bayle; the other, a case in which the lai7nx was paralized by a blow, and where

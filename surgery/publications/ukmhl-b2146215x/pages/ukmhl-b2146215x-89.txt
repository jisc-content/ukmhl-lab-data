The veins, as well as the arteries, are subject to inflammation, obliteration, ulceration, suppiu-ation, mortification, and to the deposition of calcareous matter, in their coats. The heai-t is the principal agent in the circulation of the blood; its nmscular structure gives it a power superior to that of any other agent. Its actions are two, viz.â€”a diastole, or dilatation; and a systole, or conti-action. The right aiuicle derives its blood from the veins, and contracts upon it; and whilst this aiu-icle is receiving blood from the general system, the left auiicle is receiving blood from the lungs; thus, the actions of the auricles are synchronous; tthey dilate, and conti-act together, and the ventiicles do the same. The arteries contribute a share of power to the systemic cii-culation, for if they did not, the blood could not arrive at its ultimate desti- nation ; the vis a tergo influence not being sufficient, to accomplish it. Some Physiologists, howevei*, deny that these vessels are endowed with any other power than that of elasticity; and they say, that this is the only auxiliary agent which they lend to the circidation of the blood. Berzelius is of this opinion, and many moderns believe it to be ti-ue; but I Avould, in addition to the evidences of the inherent action of vessels, afforded by local inflammation, and the phe^ nomenon of blushing, mention the variety of circu- lation observed in cold blooded animals. In fishes; the heart, as in the frog, consists of a single amicle

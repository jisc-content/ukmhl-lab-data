129 Under the sclerotic, we find a black coat, which is named the tunica choroides. It is seen to com- mence at the optic nerve, and to end at the liga- mentum cUiare, which, with true deference to Dr. Knox, seems to me to be nothing more than compact cellular tissue. The choroid tunic was supposed by Jluysch to consist of two lamina ;^ but modern minute Anatomists have exposed this mistake, by cUscovering thfit the laminated appearance ai-ises from a difference in the dii-ection of the external and internal vessels of this membrane; those which are situated externally, run vorticosely; but those internally, have a disposition parallel to each other. The tunica choroides is a secreting membrane; its secretion is a black fluid, named, pigmentum nigi'um, wliich absorbs the super- fluous rays of light. In tlae race of men, called, Albinos, this pigment is wanting; and so it is in the oAvl, and some animals; in which cases the eyes appear red, in consequence of the blood-vessels being visible; and such men and animals can see better in a weak, tlian in a strong light. To the ligamentum ciliare is attached the iris, >vhich floats in the aqueous humour, and divides the eye into two chambers; the anterior chamber is bounded by the cornea before, and the iris behind; the posterior chamber has the iris on the fore part, and the ciystalline lens posteriorly. The anterior surface of this curtain-like membrane, is of different colours, in different individuals; and sometimes

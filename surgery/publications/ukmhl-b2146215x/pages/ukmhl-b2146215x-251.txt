225 iioni, which is a branch of the lingual; and on laying open the sheath, the carotid artery, and internal jugulur vein, will come into view ; and between them, or rather concealed by them, is the par vagum. The artery is on the inner side of the vein. The sheath in which these parts ai-e included, Avill be found, on exami- nation, to have a septum, or division, between the artery and vein; so that in the operation of tying the carotid, that pai-t only of the sheath must be opened, which lies immediately over the artery. Let the student now observe the artery, vein, and nerve, as situated with regard to the neighbouring parts. Below the point where the stemo cleido, and omo hyoideus muscles cross each other, he will find the sheath, concealed by the sterno cleido, omo, and sterno hyoideus muscles; above the point of decussa- tion, it is covered by the skin, platysma myoides, and fascia only. On the imier side, ai-e the larynx, thjToid gland, ti-achea, and oesophagus. On the outer side, in the middle of the neck, is the sterno cleido mas- toideus muscle; and behind it without the sheath, are, the inferior thjToideal artery, the longus colli, and rectus capitis major muscles; and these are the soft parts in the vicinity of the sheath of the carotid. For a great part of its course, the carotid ai-tery is accompanied by small absorbent glands, which, from forming one coimected chain, are called glandulas 2 F

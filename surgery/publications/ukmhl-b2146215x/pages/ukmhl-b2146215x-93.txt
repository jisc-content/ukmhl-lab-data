69 The Lungs, (an essential appendage to the cir- ciUating- system,) are situated in the thorax, one on each side the heart; the left lung is composed of two lobes; the right, of three; and the inclination of the heiu-t 'to the left side, is the reason assigned for the diilerence in the number of lobes. The structures which enter mto the composition of these organs ai-e, the bronchia;, or ramifications of the trachea; air cells of great minuteness; two sets of arteries, the pulmo- uionary and bronchial; two sets of veins, correspond- ing with the arteries; absorbents; and nerves; these different parts are united together by a fine reticular texture; imd the whole is suiTounded by the pleu- ritic membrane. The lungs are quite free in the thorax, except at the lower, and posterior parts; where they ai-e con- fined, in some measure, by the pleura; and their figure is conical; like the cavity in which they are contained. By forcible inflation, we can distend these organs to a very great extent; but tliis will give us no just con- ception of theii- state in natural inspiration; and they are never completely collapsed; for it is impossible to deprive them of all the air wliich they contain. The lungs perform the important function of respiration; the effects of which are, a change of colour in the blood, and the production of animal heat. They are, too, accessary to the formation of the voice ; and coughing, sneezing, sighing, yawn-

293 r, The fossse of the ilia are occupied by the iliaci iuterni muscles; and each iliacus tendon passes over the fore pait of the pelvis, to be implanted into the trochanter minor of the thigh-bone. On the inner side of this muscle, is seen the psoas magnus, which arises from the sides and ti-ansverse processes of the last dorsal and four first lumbar vertebrae, and descends to be inserted into the ti-ochanter minor. The iliacus internus, and psoas magnus, ai-e covered by a thin aponeui-otic membrane, named, the fascia iliaca, which will be spoken of at another time, as contributing to form the sheath of the femoral vessels ; and over this membrane, we find the peritoneum. In addition to the use which these muscles have in bending the thigh On the trunk, they aiford a cushion-like support to the ifltestines, and the gravid uterus in the female, lujjioii riyd V/Certain arteries, veins, and nerves, must now be V Noticed. The common iliac arteiy and veui are seen l.at the inner edge of the psoas muscle; they soon divide into the internal and external iliac branches. alb <LThe student should observe the situation of the common iliac, which has been tied by Dr. Stevens. This operation might be rendered necessary by aneu- - rism of either of the branches of the internal iliac, or of i the -trunk of the external iliac, when the tumour . extends to the origin of the vessel. On the iliacus internus, aud psoas magnus, are

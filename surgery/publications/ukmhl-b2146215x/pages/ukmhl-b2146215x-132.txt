But the question agitated amongst Physiologists is, on what principle does nervous energy depend? We cannot answer; and, with humility, must confess that it is a blank in human knowledge. A recent attempt has been made to substitute another method of dissecting the brain, for the mecha- nical one which has long been pm-sued in anatomical schools. The reformers in this branch of Anatomy, ai-e Gall and Spurzeim; and in some particulars, the peculiarities of their researches, are entitled to our attention.

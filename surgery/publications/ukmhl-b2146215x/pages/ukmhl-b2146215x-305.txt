277 nem-oses of the opposite muscles; it is, therefore, the general point of insertion. The liueae semiliinares are formed by the union of the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus, to the aponeuroses of the obliquus internus and transversalis. The lineae transversales are three or four lines, which intersect the recti muscles, and not to be distinctly seen until the anterior part of the sheath of these muscles has been laid open. The student is now to reflect the external oblique muscle towards the linea alba, and underneath he will find the obliquus internus vel ascendens. Some of the fibres of this muscle take an oblique com-se upwards, others proceed almost ti-ansversely across the abdomen, and others descend obliquely towards the pubis. The muscle is inserted fleshy into some of the ribs, and •tendinous into other parts; but the expanded aponeu- rosis in front has this peculiarity; when it reaches the linea semilunaris, it splits into two laminae; one lamina ■goes before the rectus muscle, and under the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique, to the linea alba; the other layer passes to the linea alba, behind the rectus, excepting at the inferior portion of this muscle, where the whole of the tendon is found on the anterior part of the sheath. Under the obliquus internus, the student will find the fibres of the ti-ansversalis passing from the internal surfaces of the cartilages of the inferior libs, the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, the crest

198 other instrument be passed along the floor of the nostril) will be thus situated with regard to surround- ing parts. Below are the palatine processes of the superior maxillary bones, and the ossa palati, by which the cavity of the nose is separated from that of the mouth; on the inner side is the septum naiium; on the outer side, are the processes of the bones which form the floor; above, is the projection of the inferior spongy bone, which presents to the probe its concave surface; the space thus bounded, is the inferior divi- sion of the nostril, and it is here (below the inferior spongy bone) that the ductus ad nasum terminates. Above the inferior spongy bone, we find another space which is the middle division of the nostril. It is bounded below, by the convex surface of the lower spongy bone; on the outer side, by the superior maxil- lary, and the os planum of the ethmoid bone ; on the inner side, by the septum; and above, by the superior spongy bone; this middle space is more contracted than the inferior. Into it open the frontal, the sphce- noidal, and some of the ethmoidal sinuses; also the maxillary sinus, called, the antrum Highmorianum. Above the superior spongy bone, is the upper division of the nostril; here we find the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone above; the superior spongy bone on the outer side; the septum on the inner; and below, there is a contmued fissui-e to the floor of the nostrU. Into this upper space open some of the ethmoidal cells.

31 of the exti-emities;â€”the spherical, or those of the carpus and tarsus ;-and the iiregular, or those of the spine. This classification is determined, not by the form entirely, but by the manner in which ossifi- cation proceeds in the different bones. The demonstration of the bones should be com- menced with those of the cranium and face; and then, in succession, we should examine those of the spine, thorax, pelvis, upper extremities, and lower extre- mities ; enumerating theii- situation, connexion, figure, processes, foramina, general character, and uses. But, to consider the bones individually, (though necessary at fii-st) is not of so much real importance to the Sm-geon, as to study them relatively, and combined; for we must seek for the parts formed by their union, and affording lodgment to soft organs. It is obvious, that very little importance can be attached to our knowing the bones of the head and face, in an isolated state; but when joined together, they form elevations, and depressions, that must be attended to. If we were to join two or three vertebrae, we could have no correct idea of the extent of the motion, and the mechanism of the spine; because, between any two of the bones, little or no movement is allowed; but the whole, when joined, are capable of extensive motion. To explain the mechanism of the chest, we must examine it in its totality; and the same obtains, with regard to the functions of other parts of the osseous system.

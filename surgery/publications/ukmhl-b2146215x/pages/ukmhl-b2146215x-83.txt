59 due, and regular execution of its function; hence, a difference is made in the thickness of the parietes of the different cavities of the heart. The right, and left auricles have thin muscular walls; but they possess a sufficient degree of power for the purpose required, viz.â€”that of sending the blood into the right and left ventricles, which are close at hand. The parietes of the right venti-icle are more slender than those of the left; because less force of con- tractility is demanded, to ti-ansmit the blood through the lungs than to propel it, (as the left ventricle does in great measure), throughout the arterial system. An examination of the structures of the cavities of the heart, will assist us in explaining how the sides of each are approximated; how the blood is expelled; and how a retrogade coui'se of this fluid is guarded aigainst. The course of the blood is determined by the mechanism of the valves. The valves are flood-gates, which permit the passage of tlie blood in one direction oidy. They are thus named: the valve between the vena cava inferior, and the right auricle, is called, the valvula Eustachii; that, at tlie termination of the coronai-y vein, the valvula semilunaris; that, between the right auricle, and right venti'icle, the tricusped, or mitral valve. The three valves at the root of the pul- monary artery, are named, from their figure, the valvular semilunares. Between the pulmonaiy veins, and the left auricle, there ai'e no valves. Between the

335 Now it is to be allowed, that there is no posU.ve mode of determining- the exact seat of the fraeture and that the different species may be confounded. Seeing this, aU fractures of the cervix should be treated after the same manner. The ti-eatment should be, to bring the fragments, as much as possible, in coaptation, by extension and counter-extension, and to keep them in that state by retentive means. To fulfil this last indication, we must form an effectual opposition to the motions of the pelvis on the tWgh, the thigh on the pelvis, the lee on the thigh, and the foot on the leg, by means of splints properly secured. In the French Hospitals fractures of the cervix femoi-is are as attentively treated and watched, as fr-actures of the body of the femur, from a conviction that the one unites as readily as the other- we must attribute the success of Desault's cases to this attention; and, perhaps, the frequent failures in this country, to the negligent practice which is engendered by our entertaining an opposite opimon. The thio-h-bone terminates in two condyles, which contribute to form the knee-joint, which, like the elbow is of the hinge-like description, and susceptible of flexion and extension only. The bones which com- pose it are three, viz.-the femur, tibia, and patella. The ligaments are, the external and internal lateral; the posterior ligament, the capsular and Ugamentum patells ; into this last the rectus, crurseus, and vasti

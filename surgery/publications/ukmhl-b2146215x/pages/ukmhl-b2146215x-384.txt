354 When the oblique species of hernia is strangu- lated, the seat of stricture may be, the external ring, . the internal ring, or the neck of the sac; but the most common seat is the external ring. The second kind of inguinal hernia is the direct, or venti-o-inguinal. In this case, the intestine, or epiploon, or both, do not take the course of the inguinal canal, but pass directly through the external abdominal ring; and in this case, the cremaster mus- cle does not give a timic to the sac.

The liver is much larger in the child than in the grown up person, in the former it is situated in the middle tlivision of the belly; in the latter it occupies the left hypochondrium. The position of the urinary bladder too is different; its elongated form causes it, Tvhen distended with lu-ine, to rise considerably out of the pelvic cavity; but all these variations gradually disappear by the progress of age. Having premised thus much on relative position, I shall now proceed with a description of the parietes of the abdomen; the disposition of the fibres of the five pairs of muscles, and the parts formed by their aponeuroses, as linese, ligaments, &c. There are five pairs of muscles on the anterior and lateral parts of the abdominal cavity, which are named according to the direction of their fibres. A line,' drawn from the ensiform caitilage to the sym- physis pubis, in the course of what is called, the iinea alba, denotes the line of demarcation between the muscles of the opposite sides. To begin the dissection, an incision should be made through the integument, from the ciu-tilago ensi-

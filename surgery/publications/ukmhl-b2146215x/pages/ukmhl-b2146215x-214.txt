Those of prac- tical importance are the supra-orbitar; the infra-or- bitar; the facial, already alluded to ; and the dental branches. The supra-orbitar is a branch of the first branch of the fifth pair, and called the ophthalmic. It emerges firom the foramen supra-orbitai-ium to be distributed to the skin and muscles of the forehead.

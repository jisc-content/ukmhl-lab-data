144 water conducts tbem to the pulpy expansion of tlic- auditory nerve. Sound, like light, mzty be collected to a point, and thus its audibility is increased; on this principle, whis- pering galleries are eoiistructed; and this property of sotind suggested the invention of the " stethoscope " of Monsieur Laeiuiee^ an instrument employed for exploring the nature of thoracic diseases, and Avliich has recently been proposed by Lisfranc, as a useful method of distinguishing the seats of fractures. We shall allude to this instrument in a futui-e part of the voiluine. Sound like light, too^ inay be reflected • of which an echo is an illustration. The above cii-cum- stances connected with sound, viz.—its media of con- veyance; its concenti-ation; and its capability of reflection, are all, more or less, concerned in the Physiology of the ear. The trumpet-like opening of the auricle, is well calculated to receive the sonorous rays; and by its irregularities, they are directed on the principle of reflection, to the meatus auditorius externus, by which they are amassed into a naiTOW compass, and there- fore, strike with force on th6 membrana tympani, which they set in motion. But to produce the neces- sary oscillation of this membrane, there must be a cun-eut of aii- behind, as well as before it; and this is

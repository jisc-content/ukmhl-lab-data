196 inner; it is lined by a vascular and secreting mem- brane, and terminates under the inferior spongy bone. The introduction of a probe into it, to examine the nature of obstructions, is an operation which the student should practice. There is a complaint, the nature of which we should be at a loss to define, if we did not know the route which the teai-s take in escaping from the surface of the eye. The disease is called, " fistula lachry- malis," and is caused by an obsti-uction in the ductus ad nasum, either from viscid mucus, or a thickening of its lining membrane. The first symptom which denotes it, is a trickling of tears over the cheek. If the proper treatment be neglected in this stage, an inflammation will supei-vene, and the probability is, that matter will form, and a true fistula be established. There are, then, three stages; the first consists of simple obsti-uction; the second, of inflammation of the lining membrane of the sac, and duct; and the third, of suppui'ation, and ulceration: this last stage consti- tutes the true fistula lachrymaUs. The treatment depends on the stage of the disease; but a passage for the tears into the nose must eventually be made; and if the natural one cannot be restored, in consequence of its contracted state, we must make an opening into the nose thi-ough the os imguis, which, in neglected cases. Nature herself will often effect, by the ulce- rative process. For much valuable information on fistula lachrymalis, the reader may consult Pott's

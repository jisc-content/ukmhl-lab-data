And 4th.—The maxillary neu- ralgia, when the dental branches are aiFected. For the cure of neuralgia, or tic douloiu-eux many remedies have been proposed, the cai-bonate of iron is recommended by Mr. Hutchinson, and its use has been highly extolled by some practitioners who have tried it; but there is nothing so much entitled to our confidence, as the division of the trunk of the affected nerve, even this has fii-equently failed to do more than to give temporary relief, because the divided extremities re-unite, and the nerve resumes its function. The re-union has been disputed by some Physiologists, but that it really happens, is fiilly proved by the results of Dr. Haighton's interesting experiments on the par vagum, an account of which may be seen in the Eighty-fifth Volume of the " Phi-

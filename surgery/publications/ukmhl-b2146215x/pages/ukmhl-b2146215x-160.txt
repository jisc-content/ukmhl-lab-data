13G quences of certain defects in the conformation of this organ. Some people are short-sighted; this arises from ihe cornea, or ciystalline lens being too convex, which circumstance will have the effect of collecting the rays of light to a point, before they aiTive at the retina. Others again, particularly aged persons, are long- sighted; this resiUts from a too great flatness of the eye, occasioned by au absorption of a part of the hwnours; in which case, the rays do not converge at the retina. It is easy to prescribe the means of reme- dying these defects when the causes are known ; in the former case, we wish to give a greater divergency to the rays, which is done by a concave glass; and a greater convergency, which is required in the latter case, is produced by a convex one: thus, a knowledge of the causes of short and long-sightedness, and an acquaintance with the effects of concave and convex lenses, lead us to the adai>tation of remedies proper for each of these cases. It will be evident, from the sketch which we have ^iven of the Physiology of the eye, that every thing ^hich obstructs the entiy of the rays of light must interfere, more or less, with the fiinction of this orffan The cornea transpai-ens may become opaque from acute opthalmia, by which a dense lymph is often exti-avasated on its smiace, or between its lamina; or fi-om a cicati ix, left by an ulcer, or wound ; or fi-om staphyloma. By these causes, tlie rays of hgbt .vUl be pitially, or wholly prevented from entermg the

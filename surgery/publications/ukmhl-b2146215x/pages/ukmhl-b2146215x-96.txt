72 which are a base and caloiic, or the matter of heaf; the base, or acidifying principle, of the oxygen, unites with the carbon of the blood, and forms carbonic acid gas, which passes oflp in expiration; thus explaining, why more carbon is present in expired, than in inspired air. From being deprived of its carbona- ceous principle, the blood changes to a florid red colour, in which state we find it in the left cavities of the heart and arterial system. But another purpose is fulfilled by tliis chemical decomposition of the oxygen of the atmospheric air, viz.—the production of animal heat. The natural heat of the body is about 96° of Farenheit, and this obtains equally, whether man inhabits the climate where mercury freezes, or where the sun has almost a scorching power; climate, there- fore, does not aifect the internal temperature of our bodies; this arises from the lungs performing a regular and uninterrupted operation upon the oxygen inspired. We have already spoken of the way in which the base of the oxygen is disposed of; viz.— in combining with the carbon to form carbonic acid gas; the other part, or caloric, goes over to the arterial blood in a latent state; but, in the circulation, it becomes sensible, and equally maiiitains the tempe- rature of the body. The meaning of latent, and sen- sible heat, will call for further elucidation. There are two opinions concerning the nature of heat; according to one, it in the property of matter^

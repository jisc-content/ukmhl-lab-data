These ffcweral remarks on the distribution of the arteries, veins, and nerves of the lower extremity, wiU prepare the student for what we are about to say on the grouping together of parts, in detached views of the groin, inside of the thigh, ham, leg, and foot. The groin is a veiy important part of the Anas toray of the body, and one of peculiar interest to the Sui'geou, from being connected with hemiae, and from being the situation of the main artery of the lower extremity. Every student who has merely read of the parts concerned in inguinal and crural herniae, justly thinks the subject difficult and embarrassing, and almost despairs of ever knowing what Lecturers, and Anato- mical Writers m-ge as indispensable. But I will encourage the pupil, by assm-ing him, that there is no point in surgical Anatomy more simple, and that the perplexity which he feels, arises from his substituting

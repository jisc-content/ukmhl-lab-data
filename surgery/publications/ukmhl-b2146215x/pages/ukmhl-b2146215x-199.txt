175 a very little of the bone is exposed to violence. But the ossa parietalia are only defended by the scalp, tendon of the occipito frontalis, and pericranium; and, in comparison with the other bones (a portion of the temporal excepted) they are thinner, and therefore not capable of resisting any -violent injury. Whether the faculties of the mind reside in a part, or in the whole of the cerebral organ, is a question which the present state of Physiology cannot determine; but that they have their seat within the cranium, seems to be proved by the effects of injuries, and diseases of the brain. A man receives a blow on the head, the concussion of the brain susj)ends its functions; the man falls, and loses all sense, and voluntary power. The same happens in a fit of apo- plexy ; but here, the cause is compression, not concus- sion. The effects of a blow on the head are not always severe in proportion to the violence with which the blow was struck. A slight blow will sometimes lull; and other cases occur where a severe one has occa- sioned merely a temporary stun; the difference arises, in a general way, from the seat of Injury ; some parts of the head being better defended than others, as we have already shown. For a blow on the head to kill, it is not necessary that the brain should immediately suffer. A simple woimd of the scalp may termi- nate fatally, in the way we have mentioned; the chance of this fatal termination is considerably enhanced by mal-treatment of the woimd; thus, liga-

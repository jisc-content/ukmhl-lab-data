357 by a partial obliteration of the passage of communica- tion between the abdomen and the scrotum ; thus, the obliteration may not commence at the internal ring, but in the inguinal canal, leaving a pouch, into which, intes- tine, or epiploon, may easily insinuate itself; this pouch is gradually elongated, and in such a hernia, we find another sac, under the tunica vaginalis reflexa. The late Mr. Hey, of Leeds, to whom the Profession is as much indebted as to almost any man, was the first, I believe, who described this variety of hernia; it is not, however, of very frequent occurrence, -■^ib ■ .r.i. 'iWe will now give the Anatomy of the parts con- cerned in femoral, or crural hernia, some of which are the same as those of the inguinal species. This hernia takes the coui-se of the vessels of the thigh; therefore, the fascia superficialis and Poupart's liga- ment are equally concerned in both inguinal, and ciTiral herniae. • i Femoral hernia is a disease which more fre- quently happens in the female, than in the male sex; because the ligament of Poupart is more extended, owing to the greater breadth of the pelvis. The Ana- tomy of the parts ai-e, therefore, better shown in the female, than in the male subject. Before he proceeds farther with the dissection, than he has already done, in showing the Anatomy of ino iiinal hernia: the student should observe the man-

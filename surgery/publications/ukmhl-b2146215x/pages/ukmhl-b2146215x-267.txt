m for reaching it, vrouhX be that recommended by Mr; Coleman; not, however, for tjie purpose we are now considering-, but for artificial respiration. It is, to divide the thyroid cartilage by Â£i longitudinal incision ; an union of which, afterwards, is said to be as com- pletely effected, as if the trachea itself Avere cut; this operation is called laryngotoiuy. If the body had freely passed into the wind-pipe, and from being of a rounded form was capable of beuig carried up and down in that jJassage by the air, I think traclieotomy would be preferable to laryngo- tomy, and my gi-ound of preference is founded on the experiment of Favier, related by Burns, which is, that when a pea was faii'ly put into the trachea of a dog, and an opening made into the wind-pipe below the thyroid gland, the pea was raised by the force of the air expelled from the limgs, and thrown out by the wound; and this took place as often as the foreign substance was put into the wind-pipe. This might happen fi-om the proximity of the opening to the bronchi; but the pea would not, I presume, have so readily made its exit through an apertm-e in the larynx, as the edges would not be so far separable without danger, as the divided rings of the trachea are ; and independent of this circumstance, the body would be more likely to escape during a forcible expi-, ration, as it would meet with no obstruction until it arrived at the rima glottidis. 2 H

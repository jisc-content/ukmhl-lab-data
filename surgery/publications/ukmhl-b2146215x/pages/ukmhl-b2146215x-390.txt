.360 In Works on Ilenxiae, the portions of the fascia lata are much dwelt on, and I shall refer the student to them for a more minute description. The student may now examine the sheath of the vessels, a part of which, is not covered by the fascia lata; he will then dissect the deeper seated parts about the crural ring, and observe its boundaries. The parts, then, which are concerned in femoral hernia are those which are connected with the passage of the vessels from the abdomen to the groin. The coverings, which the hernial sac has, are, the common skin, the fascia superficialis, and the fascia propria of Cooper. The seat of stricture, when strangulated, may be the edge of Poupart's ligament, Gimbemat's ligament, or the mouth of the sac. I shall only make two or three more observations, which are suggested by the importance of knowing the Anatomy of the parts concerned in hernia, in the application of trusses; in the taxis; and in the operation. We learn, by the Aaiatomy of the inguinal species of hernia, the situation where the pad of the ti-uss should be placed, in order to produce a radical cure, viz.—not over the external, but the internal ring; for the mouth

104 Between the skin and cartilages of the ear, there are very many small bodies, called, cei-uminous glands, which secrete the ivax. In the internal ear, we have the water of tJie lahyrinthy which is supposed to be secreted by the membrane which lines the concha, vestibule, and semicircular canals. It sei"ves as a medium for trans- mitting the rays of sound from the membranes of the foramen ovale, to the sensible expanded pulp of the auditory nerve. A deficiency of either of the above secretions will alfect, more or less, the auditoiy function. There is a mucous secretion in the nostrils, formed by the mucous glands. Its use is to defend the papillÂ£e of the alfactory nei-ves. In catarrh, the secretion is increased. All the cavities which communicate with the nostrils, ai-e lined by a membrane, furnished with the same secretory apparatus as the pituitary membrane of the nose. The fluids of the mouth are the saliva, and mucus; the former has been already mentioned; the latter is secreted by the tonsils, and other mucous glands. *

71 and this is reducible to matter of fact; but to render this intelligible, I must first speak of the nature and composition of atmospheric air. The air of the atmosphere which surrounds us, is composed of three gases, besides heterogeneous matters. The gases are, oxygen, nitrogen, or azote, and carbonic acid, and in one hundred parts, they are usually found in the following proportions : of oxygen, about 22 pai-ts; of nitrogen, 77; and of caa-bonic acid, about one; but Mr. Dalton thinks that there is not one per cent of carbonic acid gas. This is the air we inspire. But on analysing the air expired, instead of one of car- bonic acid gas in 100 parts, we find much more; and the oxygen proportionally diminished. Dr. Henry observes, in his " ELEMENTS or ExperimentaI/ Chemistry," that when the state of the expired air is examined, a quantity of oxygen is found to have dis- appeared, equal to the carbonic acid gas which has been formed. Now, as carbonic acid has been proved to contain its own bulk of oxygen gas, it follows, that all the oxygen which disappears in respiration, must have been expended in forming this acid. A chemical change, then, has been effected; and to that change may be attributed the alteration in the colour of the blood. It would appear, that the atmospheric air in the lungs becomes decomposed, on the principle of chemical affinity: that when the carbonised or venous blood is exposed to its action in the lungs, a portion of the oxygen is resolved into its constituent pai-ts,

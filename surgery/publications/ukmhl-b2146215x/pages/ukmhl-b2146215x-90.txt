66 and ventricle; the ventiicle opens into a bulb, or pedicle, from which, the branchial, or artery of the gUls, takes its origin. The blood, after circulating through the minute vessels of the gUls, arrives at the aorta; and by this main tnink and its branches, it is sent to the different parts of the body; here, therefore, it is scai-cely possible for the heart to communicate its impulse to the general arterial system. It is in the muscular and elastic coats of arteries, that the power resides, which assists in propelling the blood onwards. The veins, too, have an inherent principle of action; less in degree, however, than the arteries; but as the column of blood in them is supported by valves, less is necessarj'. In the ai'teries, and veins, there is always a column of blood, which is forced forwards by the action of the heart, aided by that of the ai-teries and veins. The capacity of this column is sometimes small, aiid some- times great; the diminution and increase correspond with the systole and diastole of the left ventiicle, from which circumstance are chiefly derived the phenomena of the pulse. The Pulse is the effect of the action of the heart upon the blood; Avhich action causes an elong- ation, as well as a dilatation, of the artery in which the pulse is felt. The pulsations at the wrist do not take place at the same moment of time, as those of the carotid, and other arteries near the heai't; the interval is long, or .short, in proportion to the

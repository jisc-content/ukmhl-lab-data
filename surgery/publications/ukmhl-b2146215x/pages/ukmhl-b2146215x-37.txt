15 cavity by entanglement before the os tinese is sealed up; aiid—2clly. To secrete, or form, the maternal paa't of the placenta. The embryo in utero derives its nom-ishment fi-om the mother; its Life is almost Vege- table, many of its organs being of no nse. It has eyes, ears, a nose, and a month, but they ai-e useless. The lungs perform no function, nor do the digestive or°-ans. There is a cii-culation, but singiUarities exist in^thc organs which execute it. The placenta, which is the mediiun of commiuiication between the parent and her offspring in utero, is composed of two distinct pai-ts, the one named maternal, the other foetaJ, and between the two, there is a structui-e, either vascular or cellular, but whether the one, or the other, or both, is still doubtful. The blood passes from the mother to the placenta by the uterine arteries, and from thence to the navel of the child, by the umbiUcal vein. Having entered the child's body at the navel, the blood is carried by the umbilical vein towards the liver, Avherc it separates into two currents; one passes into the substance of the liver by the venae portae, the other goes to the vena cava by the ductus venosus, and . eventually both currents amve at the i-ight aui-icle of the heai-t. In the adult subject, the blood is sent from the right auricle into the right ventiicle; from the right venti-icle to the lungs, by the pulmonaiy artery; and from the limgs to the left auricle, by the four pulmonary veins; but in the foetus, the cfrculation is different. As the child does not breathe, there is no reason why the organs of respiration should be sup-

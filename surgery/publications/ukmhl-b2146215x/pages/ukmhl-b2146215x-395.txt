The crural nerve is so far removed from the artery, as not to be at ail in danger. When the external iliac, or upper portion of the femoral artery is obstructed, the blood passes into the lower extremity, principally, by the following branches. The internal iliac artery gives off the glutajal, which communicates with branches of the femoral and pro- funda ; also, the ischiatic and obturator, which anas- tomose with the circumflex branches of the profunda fempris â€¢, and there are other collateral passages : by these means, the cumulation is sufficiently established for present purposes, and becomes free, in time, by the gradual enlargement of the inosculating branches. Sir Astley Cooper has published a minute accovmt of the anastomoses of the aa-teries at the groin, in the Fourth Volume of the " Medico-Chirurgical Trans- actions.'''' 1.;. Popliteal anemisra, or aneurism of the popliteal artery, is treated by the application of a ligatm-e to the femoral artery, about the middle of the thigh, where the sartorius muscle crosses the vessel. The artery is enclosed in a sheath of condensed cellular membrane, accompanied by its vein. The ope- ration of tying the femoral artery, for popliteal

83 life, the solids and fluids of the body are constantly imdergoing changes : there is no durability in either, for each solid and fluid is continually acquiring new matter, and losing a pait of that which is old and useless; the sources of addition are the chyle and blood; and those of abstraction, the excretions. If a part sustains an injury by a cutting instrument, and the divided surfaces of the wound be placed in contact, adliesive matter will be eflftised; and this will be the uniting medium. But if there be a loss of substance, lymph is secreted by the vessels of the part, the neighbouring arteries &c. will shoot into it; the lymph wiU thus be endowed with life, the void filled up, and at length the injury repaired; these are illustrations of the processes by which all structures are restored, that are restorable, viz.â€”adhesion, and granulation; and blood is the source from whence these modes of reparation ai-e derived. The condition of this fluid depends, in great measm-e, on the energy of the powers of digestion; but it may be altered in its properties, by disease. The alterations which the blood undergoes by disease, is an inquiry well deserving the attention of the Pathologist, and Chemist. Amongst other thmgs worthy of notice, is the colour of this fluid imme- diately on abstraction from the vessel. The colour is

3 characterized its infancy. If actual Anatomy be withdi-a^vn from the auxiliaries to the heahn^ art, Empiricism wiU soon usm-p the throne of Science; and the bodily afflictions of mankind wUl be lett to blind chance alone for their termination. Anatomy is the science of Organization; the means of learning it are Dissection and Observation and these mnst go hand in hand. If our knowledge of man were Umited to his exterior, Therapeutics would experience almost as little improvement from the study as if we viewed an automaton, to which motion and gesture were given by concealed mechanical contri- vances. It is the province of Dissection to develope flie secret springs of action, and to discover the organs which support life, it is therefore the foundation of Physiology; and as an acquaintance with the natural structure, arrangement of structure, and the fimctions of structm-e, is necessary to enable us to detect dis- eased structure, and diseased ftmction of structure, it must follow, that Anatomy and Physiology are the basis of Patiiology. How incongruous and absurd would it be to suppose, that a man could discover an inaccuracy in the movements of a watch without know, ing the proper arrangement of parts in that interesting piece of mechanism; or that he could rectify the im- paired machinery of a steam-engine, if ignorant of the adaptation of the parts on which the operation of that master-piece of human ingenuity depend. Not more so than either, would it be to beUeve, that the Physician

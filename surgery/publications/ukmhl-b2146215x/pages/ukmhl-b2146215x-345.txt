315 The motions of the wrist are, flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. The flexor muscles are on the anterior part of the bones; the extensors, on the posterior part; the Ibl'tors, on the radial side; and the adductors, on the ulnar side of the fore-arm. The thumb can be moved more extensively than the fingers, but not in more directions. The mot^ons of both are, flexion, extension, abduction, and ad- Auction. , The student is now to apply what he has learnt â–  :,:^f the actions of muscles to the explanation of those .Zigns of fraettn-es which are ftunished by deformity of ,,tlimb, or displacement. When the clavicle is broken, we discover the "nature of the accident by observation on the form of the shoulder, and by passing the fingers along the body of the bone, which will present an irregularity ; this is occasioned by the extremity of the internal fragment projecting above the external one; it is not, however, the inner, but the outer fragment that is dis- placed, and Anatomy tells us why it is so. Above the inner portion, is the attachment of the sterno cleido mastoideus muscle, and opposite to it, below, is the origin of a paxt of the pectoralis major. If either the clavicular poition of the sterno cleido, or that of the

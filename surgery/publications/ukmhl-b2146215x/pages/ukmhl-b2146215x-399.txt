369 neal, iustoad of being- expended at the ankle, was continued over the dorsum of the foot, and supplied the place of the anterior tibial vessel. This discovery induced a belief, that in the case above related, the arteries were mal-distributed in a similar way, and was applied to explain the reason why the bleeding was not checked, when the anterior tibial was tied. This explanation, however, is not so satisfactoiy, as that the avterj was fed by anastomosing branches; for the mal- disti-ibution mentioned, must be extremely rare, since I camiot find an example of the same variety in any Anatomical Work. .,, The Author here concludes his volume, which has far exceeded the proposed limits ; but he has been almost imperceptibly carried forwards, by the impor- tance of the subject. After all his labour, however, he cannot flatter himself, that the work is complete in its arrangement, or in its execution ; but he submits it to professional candour, and avows his willingness to avail himself of any suggestion that may improve it, or further tend to facilitate the acquirement of that knowledge, which has a direct influence on the hap- piness of mankind. 2 z

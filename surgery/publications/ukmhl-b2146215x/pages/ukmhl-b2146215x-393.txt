The appella- tion given to each species, is derived from the situa- tion in which the protrusion takes place. Thfe mdsf important relation of the Anatomy of the gioin to surgery, is, perhaps to be awarded to hernise; but aneurism of the external iliac artery, or of thte femoral, high up, is another subject which ■demands an intimate knowledge of the parts contained in this region of the body. -jjniviii an anem-ism of the external iliac artery, it is nectessary to pass a ligature about the vessel above the seat of disease. To do this, the Surgeon must know how the ai-tery runs, and how it is relatively placed Avith regard to other parts. The internal abdominal ring is situated at a pointy midway between the ante- rior superior spinous process of the ilium, and the spinous process of the pubis. Behind this opening, is the external iliac artery; on the inner side of the arteiy, is the vein; and on the outer side, is the ante- rior crui-al nerve. The vessels are contained in a sheath behind the peritoneum. To reach the artery then, it is clear, that an inci- sion must be made above Poupart's ligament; that the aponeurosis of the external muscle must be raised; that the spermatic cord, and margin of the internal

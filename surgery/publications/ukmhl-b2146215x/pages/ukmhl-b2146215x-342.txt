312 understand the actions of muscles -without a previous knowledge of the mechanism of the joints ? Certainly not; he must therefore avaU himself of the means which eveiy dissecting-room affords, to gain the necessary preliminary information. Before commencing the dissection, the stu- dent should familiarize himself with the relation of the hard to the soft pai-ts. He can easily trace the clavicle from its sternal to its scapular extre- ,mity. Behind the clavicle, is the first rib, over which the subclavian artery passes; and in a depression under the scapular end of the collar-bone, the artery may be compressed so as to command the circulation of the blood in the arm. The acromion scapula? is superficial. The head of the os humeri may be felt by â– tlie fingers, in the axilla, when the ami is raised. The condyles of the os humeri, and the olecranon ulnae are prominent points at the elbow-joint, and the styloid processes of the radius and ulna, at the wrist. By knowing the natural situation of these hard part-s, the student acquires the means of detecting injuries of joints. I do not think it necessai^ to give a description of the origins, insertions, and individual uses of the muscles of the extremities, for it cannot be expected that this volume should supply the place of a JNIajiual of Dissections, for the aim of it is different; but after the student has exposed and dissected them, the

300 the head to the chin, which is from five inches, to five and a quarter. A line drawn from the forehead to the upper part of the occiput, will measure about four inches and a half. The shortest line is iiom the pro- tuberance of one parietal bone to the other, which is not more than three inches, It will be obvious by this comparison of the admeasurements of the pelvis, and the child's head, that there is ample room for the latter to pass through the apertures of the former, without the least com- pression of the bones; but how is the delivery accom- plished when the pelvis measures, from sacrum to pelvis, very much less than natural ? Dr. Merriman tells us, in his " Synopsis of Dif- ficult Parturition;'' that Dr. Osborne, who took great pains in investigating the best method of proce- dure in cases of distorted pelvis, considers that a foetus, at full matmity, cannot pass alive, if the dimensions of the pelvis, from the pubes to the projection of the sacmn, be only two inches and three quarters; and Dr. Clarke, of Dublin, says, that three inches and a quarter, from the pubes to the sacrum, is die least diameter through which he has known a full-grown foetus to pass entire; but as it has been ascertained by Dr. Hamilton, that children have been born living, through a pelvis in which this diameter was " mani- festly under three inches," it is necessai7 that practi- tioners of midwifery should be very much upon their guai-d against being deceived in their estimate of the

We may finally state, with respect to the Patho- logy of the ear, that the difficulty of cure is in propor- tion to the depth of the malady; if supei-ficial, it may be relieved, or removed; if deep, the chances are very much against our being able to do any good by cither medical or siu'gical means. For the ti-eatmeut of diseases of the ear, the student should consult the works of Mr. Saimders, and JMr. Curtis, on the affections of this organ. The third of the five senses, is the sense of smell; the acuteness of which is in proportion to the deve- lopement of the nostiils.

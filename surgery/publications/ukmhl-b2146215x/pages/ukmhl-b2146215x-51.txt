27 of bone. If a bone be sawn through, it wUl be found to consist of an external, and compact structure, which is caUed the shell of the bone, and of an internal, and cellular structui-e, named cancelli. Bone is not inorganized, as the facts abeady stated must convince us, for it is susceptible of injui-y, and has, within itself, the means of repai-ation, which is not a property of inorganic matter. Like to other structures, it has blood-vessels, nerves, and absorbents; but, in addition to these, it has an animal and earthy matter; the former consisting of what chemists call gelatine, the latter, principally of carbonate and phosphate of lime, which are secretions, and regularly deposited in the form of fibres; it is in the first substance, that the blood-vessels are found. Experiments and disease show, that an animal matter is a component part of bone; by chemical means, we can remove the earthy, .without interfering much with the animal substance. After subjecting a bone to the action of muriatic acid, diluted with water, it is rendered flexible, and can easily be twisted into any shape; tliis is owing to a chemical decomposition, the earthy part of the bone quitting the animal, in consequence of its greater affinity for the acid, by wliich the solidity of the bone is destroyed. In the disease called moUities ossium, a similar change takes place. In this extraordinary affection, all the calcareous matter is, from some unknown causje, absorbed; and from the secreting vessels ceasing to renew the supply, the bones lose their solidity and strength, yield to the superincumbent

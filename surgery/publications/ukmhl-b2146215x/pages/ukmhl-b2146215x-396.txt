366 aneurism, has been so frequently jperformed, as to leave no doubt on the mind, as to the efficacy of the treatment, and its freedom from danger. Th6 usual auastomosmg vessels are, the profunda and its branches, which communicate with the rami muscii- lares, and other branches of the femoral artery ; also, with the articular arteries of the popliteal. When the femoral artery is obliterated to the profunda branch, which is sometimes the case, even when the ligature is applied on the vessel low down, the rami perfdi rantes of the profunda femoi-is, and' the rami arlict^i lares of the popliteal, are the channels which'tli^ blood takes, to arrive at the lower jjart of the litnb. *'^^ In the dissection of the ham, wfe Md;''ulilSr the skin, much cellular membrane; and then a strdfag fascia which binds down the vessels and nerves of thi^l partiijwljich .ar& embedded in much fat, and celhila^^ membrane. The nerve first appears ; and close to the bone are, the popliteal artery, and vein. The ham- strings are formed by the tendons of the flexor mus- cles of the leg. The branches of the popliteal artery are, the superior external and internal, and the infe- rior external and internal articular ai-teries; and the arteriae surales, which are spent chiefly on the head St the gastrocnemius externus muscle. The articular anf- teries freely communicate with each other, and witil' the recurrent tibial, and by these, the circulation "i^' carried on, after the course of the blood in the itiaili^ trunk is stopped. . ^ i > -"-t-'

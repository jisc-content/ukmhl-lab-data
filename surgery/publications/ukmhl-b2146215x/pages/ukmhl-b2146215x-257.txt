231 here more doubtful, than when one of the carotids is tied, and the reason will by and by be explained. The brachial, and its branches ; the intenial iliac ; the ex- ternal iliac; the femoral, and its divisions, may be operated on with safety; but whether the arteria inno- minata, and the aorta, can be tied with impunity, is questionable. Modern surgeiy, however, seems to be so aspiring, as to stand at nothing; and what can tend better to prove this assertion, than the bold opera- tion undertaken by Sir Astley Cooper, in 1817 ? This Sixrgeon dared even to pass a ligatm-e about the aorta three-fourths of an inch above its bifurcation ; but the ui-gent circumstances of tbe case fully justified so des- perate a measure. Dr. Mott, in America, has also distinguished himself by passing a ligature on the arteria imiominata, for a case of aneurism of the sub- clavian artery, where the whole vessel was found so diseased, that the Surgeon had no alternative, but to tie the common trunk. This was a bold operation, and the performance of it evinced, on the part of the Surgeon, great confidence in the resources of nature; but the confidence was warrantable, and why ? Mr. Burns tied the arteria innominata, on the dead subject, with two ligatures, and cut across the vessel in the space between them, without hurting any of the surrounding vessels. Afterwards, even coarse injections, impelled into the aorta, passed freely by the anastomosing branches into the arteries of the right arm; filling them and all the vessels of the head

281 neura, at the posterior surface of the recti muscles. —Its reflection over the fundus of the bladder. c.—Its ascent on the rectiun, leaving a pouch between the bladder and rectum, d.—Connexion with the sacrum, and reflection on the walls of the pelvis. e.—Over the sigmoid flexure of the colon, which is bound down to the venter of the left ilium. /.—A portion passing forwards over the small intestines, and after giving a covering to them, returning to the spine to form the mesentery, g.—Its reflection on the descending colon, h.—On the anterior siu'face of the kidney, i.—The membrane running forwards to the transverse arch of the colon, to form the posterior layer of the meso-colon. h.—Posterior layer of the descending portion of the bag of the omentum. I.—The same continued upwards, making the anterior layer of the ascending portion of the bag of the omentum. m.—Its covering to the anterior surface of the stomach. n.—The anterior layer of the omentum minus, o.— Reflection over the convex surface of the liver, p.— On the concave surface of the diaphragm, q.—Its descent on the posterior surface of the recti muscles to meet at (uj, where the larger bag of the jjcritoneum terminates. To demonstrate the smaller bag, the omentum minus must be broken through, we shall then expose the posterior surface of the stomach, the posterior surface of the arch of the colon, the duode- irum, and tlie pancreas. The posterior layer—r.—-of the omentum minus is to be thus followed. —Its contmuation over the posterior surface of the stomach, 2 N

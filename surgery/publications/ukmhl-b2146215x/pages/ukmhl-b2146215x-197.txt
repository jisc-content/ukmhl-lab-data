173 transverse siitm-e. It is covered by the common inte- gument, wliich is here called, the scalp; but though common integument, as Pott observes, injuries done to it, by external violence, become of much more consequence than the same kind of ills can prove, when inflicted on the common integuments of the rest of the body; a circumstance arismg from its connec- tions -with important parts. Growing from the scalp, are, the capilli, or hafrs of the head, which, like the other hafrs of the body, ai-e inorganized sti'uctures, that is to say, not alive; but they proceed fi-om bulbs which possess life, and a power of secretion. Having reflected the scalp, we find on its porterior surface the tendon of the occipito frontalis muscle, that muscle which produces the transverse wrinkles of the forehead; and immediately covering the bones of the cranium is the membrane called perici-anium, but which in other situations is named periosteum. The pericranium firmly adheres to the cranium, by means of blood-vessels passing fi-om the one to the other, and by insinuating itself into the sutures, and there meeting with corresponding insinuations of the dura mater, or external membrane of the brain. These communications between the external and internal parts of the head, explain pathological facts of not unfrequent occurrence, viz.â€”how slight injuries, or erysipelas, of the scalp, and pericranium, terminate lutally, by producing inflammation of the brain. It is on this account, that we would prohibit the applica- tion of a blister to the scalp in phreuitis.

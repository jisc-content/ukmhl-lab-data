.336 muscles are inserted, which muscles act on the tibia, and produce the extension of the leg upon the thigh. Internally, we find the alar and cinacial ligaments, and some transverse ligamentous bands uniting the two semilunar cartilages. As there are no massy soft parts surrounding this articulation, we can readily discover the alterations jjroduced in it, by accident and disease. The superficial nature of the knee-joint predis- poses it much to dislocation, and from being more ex- posed to violence from falls, than any other articula- tion, this accident is not of unfrequent occurrence, the patella, however, is oftener displaced from its situation, than the tibia is from the articulatory surfaces of the femur. The leg consists or two bones, tlie tibia, and fibula; the tibia is articulated with the femur above, and with the asti-agalus below. The fibula is aiticu- lated above with the tibia, therefore is not at all con- nected with the knee-joint. At the ankle-joint we find three bones, the tibia, the fibula, and the astra- galus. The tai-sal bone, called astragalus, has an articulatoiy surface for each of the bones of the leg Scarcely any other motions are allowed at the ankle, besides flexion and extension. Although this articulation is rendered exceedingly strong by cajjsular and other ligaments, it is, next to llie shoulder-joint, the most liable to dislocation; and

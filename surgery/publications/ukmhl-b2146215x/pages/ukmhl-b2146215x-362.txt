332 to whether re-union takes place >y hen the fracture is within the ligament, had scarcely heen expressed amongst the Hospital Surgeons of this country; but the French Surgeons and ourselves have always been at variance on this question. The arguments, however, on this branch of Pathology, ai-e so conflicting, as we shall presently show, as to make us cautious in vindir- . eating, in a positive manner, either of the opposite, opinions. ' i"" Desault states his full conviction that fractures, of- , the cervix femoris, occurring in a healthy constitution,, will unite, on the average, in about forty days,, and,^- ; generally without deformity. In the " Parisian Chi- rurgical Journal^'' published mkny years ,ago..by Desault, who was then Principal Surgeon ;to,i^he ^ .

Let us now oppose to this opinion, the observa- tions of Sir Astley Cooper, whose experience has not fallen far short of that, which Desault himself enjoyed.

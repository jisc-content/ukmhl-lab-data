309 only ; if the first, or dislocation upwards should hap-- pen, it must undoubtedly be complicated with fi-acture of the acromion process of the scapula, seeing tha that process advances considerably over the vipper pai-t of the joint. The arm consists of one bone, the os humeri, Avhich has a rounded head above; and an irregular extremity below, formed by the projecting condylesj and the articular surface for the ulna, which is be- tween them. The other remarkable points of this bone are supposed to be understood by the student. The elbow-joint is of the hinge-like description, and capable only of flexion and extension. The hume- rus terminates in an articidatoiy surface, on which the ulna plays; and on the outer side of the ulna, is the radius, or other bone of the fore-arm, the head of which is applied to the extreme point of the external condyle of the humerus. The ligaments of the elbow- joint are strong; there is an external lateral, an inter- nal lateral, an oblique, and a capsulai-; besides these, there are ligaments connecting the radius to the ulna. The movements of the former bone on the latter are called, pronation, and supination; pronation, when the palm of the hand is turned downwards; supina- tion, when turned upwards. The elbow-joint is also strenthened by the tendons of muscles; thus behind, we find the expanded tendon of the tnceps, which is attached to the olecranon process of the ulna; and on

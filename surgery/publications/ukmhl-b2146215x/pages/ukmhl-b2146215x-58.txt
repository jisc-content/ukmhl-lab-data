34 projects forwai-d; in its descent through the thorax, the curvature is backward; and in the loins, forward again: thus its figure has been compared to the italic f. Between the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar verte- brae, and even amongst the vertebriB of each class, there are differences, or peculiarities, which must not be overlooked. The fii-st cei-vical is called the atlas, and is nothing more than a bony ring. The second is named the dentata, fi-om its having a toothlike process. The thii-d, foui-th, fifth, and sixth, resemble one another. The seventh is like a dorsal vertebra. The transverse processes of the seven vertebrae of the neck are perforated with a hole; the holes of the six superior ti-ansmit the vertebral arteries to the brain; that in each transverse process of the seventh is for the transmission of a vein. The student will readily discover the peculiarities in the rest; and will find no difficulty in accounting for their effects on the degrees of motion in the different parts of the spine. The movements of the spinal column are freest in the neck; next, in the loins; and lastly, in the dorsal vertebra;. The articulation of the vertebrae to the ribs laterally, and the locking together of theii- spinous processes, are the causes why they are least moveable in the b'ack. The dorsal vertebrae form the back part of the Thorax, and pa.ssing forwards from them are the

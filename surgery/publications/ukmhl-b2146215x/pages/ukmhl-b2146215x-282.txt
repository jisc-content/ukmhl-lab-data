254 The proximate causes assigned for dropsies in the different parts of the body, arc, increased secretion, and diminished absorption. When more fluid is poured out by the exhalent vessels of the pleura, than natural, although the absorbents are as active as in health, it is obvious that the fluid would accumulate, from the balance of exhalation and absorption being destroyed. On the other hand, should the exhalation be in its due quantity, and absorption by any cause be diminished, it is equally obvious, that the result would be similar. This is the view which Patholo- gists have taken of the nature of dropsies. But some modern experiments on the mechanism of absorption, by the ingenious French Physiologist Majendie, may tend, by their result, to overthrow this kind of reason- ing on the proximate causes. From a series of well- conducted experiments, he has been led to infer, that the veins and arteries, both large and small, are en- dowed with an absorbent power; that absorption depends on the capillary attraction of the vascular walls; that the more numerous the vessels, the more rapid is the absorption; and that distension, or ple- thora, weakens the absorbing power, and if conside- rable, entirely suspends it. The results of the experiments, which will be found detailed in the First Number of the " Journal de Phijsiologie Experimentale," are exceeding inter- esting ; and prove, either that the blood-vessels ai-e endowed with an absorbent power, and that that power

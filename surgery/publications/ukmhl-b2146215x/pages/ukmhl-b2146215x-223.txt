197 Treatise oa the subject, Scarpa's Work, and Ware, " On the Epiphora," &c. As the student will not be able properly to exa- mine the sti-uctures of the globe of the eye, in a sub- ject on the dissecting table, I have introduced remarks on the Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology, of this organ, in another part of the volume. Nose, and Nasal Cavities.—The external figure of the nose is pyramidal; its divisions are into radix, dorsum, alae, and apex. Internally, we find two cavities, called, the nosti-ils; one nostril is sepa- rated fi-om the other by the septum narium, and in each are observed eminences and depressions. The Anatomy and Physiology of this organ are described elsewhere; but we have to consider certain relations which it has to other parts. If a probe be passed along the floor of either nostril, the instrument will appear behind the soft palate; thus, a commimication exists between the nose, and the fauces. This knowledge involves important points of practice, viz.—the introduction of a tube into the trachea, for the purpose of inflating the lungs in cases of suspended animation, or into the oesophagus, for injecting fluids into the stomach, or drawing fluids from it, or into the Eustachian tube, to clear it from obstruction. To these points of practise, we shall recur presently. The probe (or whatever

The nails and hairs are the appendices to the skin; and like the cuticle, ai'c inorganized, and insen- sible substances; the former are secreted by a glandiUar sti'uctures; the latter grow from roots or bulbs, situ- ated in the cellular membrane, under the skin. According to the experiments of Mr. Hatchctt, hair consists of gelatine, and coagulated albumen; besides which, it is said to contain oils, ii-on, oxide of manganese, lime, silica, and sulphiu-. We have now considered the five species of sen- sations, which convey information to the mind, viz.— seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching. The two first of these senses are produced by means of media, which modify the impressing agents; but for the three last, it is required, that the object be brought into contact with the organ to be impressed; thus the odorous particles must be applied to the pitu- itary membrane, in order to be smelt; saj)id bodies must come in contact with the tongue, in order to be tasted; and tactile bodies, with the skin, in order to be felt.

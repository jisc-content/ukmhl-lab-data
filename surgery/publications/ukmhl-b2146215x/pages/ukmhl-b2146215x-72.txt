48 the liver, anil pancreas; by which the bile, and pan- creatic jnice are discharged from their respective organs. There can be no doubt that these fluids are the agents of chylilication; although it has been dis- puted by some Physiologists, whether the former has any thing to do with the chylifiant process. The celebrated Blumenbach thinks that the bile separates itself into two portions, a serous, and resinous; and that the foi-mer probably mixes with the chyle, and is carried back to the blood, whilst the latter combines with the faeces, and acts as a stimulus to the peristaltic motion of the intestines. The ingenious, and industrious French Physiologist, Richerand, entertains a similar opinion. After speak- ing of the combined pancreatic and biliar}' fluids, as serving to penetrate the chyme, to render it fluid, to animalize it, to separate the chylous fi'om the excre- mentitious pait, and to precipitate whatever is not nutritious; he says,â€”" in brmging about this separa- tion, the bile itself seems to be divided into two parts; its oily, coloured, and bitter portion passes along with the excrements, sheathes them, and imparts to them the stimulating qualities necessary to excite the action of the digestive tube. Its albuminous and saline particles combine with the chyle, become incor- porated to it, are absorbed along with it, and return into the circulation." How the separation is effected, Richerand confesses his ignorance. He thinks that this act of the Animal (Economy is as mysterious and inexplicable as the action of the brain, in producing thought; a phenomenon, which many Physiologists

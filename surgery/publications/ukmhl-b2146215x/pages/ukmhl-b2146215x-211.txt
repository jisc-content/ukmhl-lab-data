The student will learn from these remai-ks, 1st.—^That the side on which the angle of the mouth is deformed, is not the diseased side; the muscles draw the comer upwards, from not being antagonized, or opposed; and 2dly.—That when there is a loss of muscular power, in the left arm and leg, the cause may be suspected to occupy the opposite side of the brain. There is no law in Pathology more general, than that the paralysis of the parts below the neck, is situated on the side opposite to that of disease in the brain; but still some exceptions to it have been men- tioned. M. Bayle, an eminent French Physician, has re-published the cases of Morgagni, and others, where pai-alysis occurred on the same side as the cerebral lesion. He attempts to explain these cases, by saying, that some fibres are found not to decussate, but to continue from the brain to the spinal marrow, or from the spinal maiTOw to the brain. This fact, so amply proved and demonsti-ated by Gall, offers, he thinks, the only rational solution which we yet possess of the exceptions to the general rule in question. Having carefully dissected the muscles, the stu- dent will observe their connections with other parts; particularly with the parotid duct and nerves. The parotid duct will be found, on carefully removing the fat, which is usually deposited between 2 A

158 lular membrane, and the fibres of the cremaster muscle. From the testis the cord ascends; passes through the external abdominal ring; traverses the inguinal canal, or that oblique space between the two rings; and enters the abdomen through the foramen, in the fascia transversalis. On arriving at this point, the different component parts of the cord are seen to separate ; the vas deferens descends to the neck of the bladder, and the ai-tery, veins, &c. pass upwaids. The excretory duct of each testis, is named the vas deferens, it descends to the vesicula seminalis, a con- voluted body lying at the under and lateral part of the urinary bladder ; and terminates with the duct of the vesicula seminalis, in the urethra, at a process of the lining membrane, called caput gallinaginis, vel veru- montanum. The vesiculae seniinales are the reservoirs of the semen ; but some Physiologists have assigned to them other purposes. The penis is composed of three bodies; the two corpora cavernosa above, and the corpus spongiosum below; in this last body is the ui-ethra, or outlet for the urine, and semen. The corpora cavernosa, and corpus spongiosum are-covered by a continuation of the common slun, which forms anteriorly a loose fold, called, the prae- putium. These parts ai'c plentifuUy suppHed with arteries, veins, absorbents, and nerves.

maxilla can be rotated, as in the act of grinding- the food. The ligaments of the lower jaw are the capsu- lar, external lateral, and internal lateral. The move- ments of which it is susceptible in the human body, are, downwai-ds, upwards, forwai-ds, backwai-ds, and laterally inwards, and outwards. When the lower jaw is closed, the glenoid cavities are observed to be accurately filled by the condyloid processes; when slightly depressed, the latter will be seen to quit the former in a partial manner, and to press against the small elevated points on the forepart of the cavities. If still more depressed, they will mount over the elevations alluded to, and slip under the zygomatic arches; this will illustrate how disloca- tion happens from yawning, or violent laughing, in which acts, the condyles are easily dislocated, when a spasmodic action seizes the muscles connected with the jaw. As organs connected with the face, we shall now describe the Relative of Anatomy the eyes, nose, and mouth. Eye.â€”In a former part of the volume, we men- tioned the structures which enter into the composition of the eye, and the changes which this organ under- goes by disease. In this place, we shall explain the surgical Anatomy of the appendages, particularly of the lachrymal apparatus. 2 E

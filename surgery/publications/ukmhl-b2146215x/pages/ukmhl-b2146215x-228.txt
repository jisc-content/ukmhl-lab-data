202 outer, or molar wall is thick; the intier, or nasal, is exceedingly thin. We have already said, that the antrum^ as well as the other sinuses of the hones of the head, is lined by a membrane similar to the pituitary; the office of which is to secrete a mucous" fluid to bedew their surfaces. Shotild this fluid be secreted in too gl-eat abundance, by the reflection of the membrane which covers the fi-outal, the sphenoidal, and the ethmoidal sinuses, or the nostrils, we can easily conceive how the superabundance is got rid off, as it can be evacuated by the nose; but when the secretion is in excess in the antrum, the mode of escape is not so easy- True it is, that a communication exists witfr the nose ; but the opening is smdl, and its mechanism such, as to offer a valvular obstruction. Mr. Burns says, " Urine might as readily regui-gitate from the bladder along the ureter, as fluid pass fi-om the antrum into the nosebut, perhaps, the analogy is here carried too far; yet it is certain, that when by disease, or accident, the membrane becomes swollen, or thickened, the obstruction is complete. When there is a preternatural accumulation of fluid, whether mucus, or pus, in this cavity, we are not to expect that that mucus, or pus, will find an exit by the nose; how then is it to be discharged? It is to be done by forming a new passage, by extract- ing one of the grinding teeth, and perforating from its socket into the antrum. After the matter is thus dis- charged, the disease of the membrane, if it be of a-

302 The bladder is situated in the fore part; the rec- tum, in the back part; and the internal organs of generation, between the two; and this intervention of the vagina, uterus, and its appendages, constitutes the principal difference between the pelvic viscera of the male, and those of the female. The reflection of the peritoneum may be followed over the bladder, as in the male subject. When it reaches the inferior pail of that organ, it ascends over the anterior face of the vagina and uterus, leaving a sort of pouch between the bladder and the womb; it ihen expands, to form the ligamenta lata, in which the fallopian tubes and ovaria are involved; and afterwards it gives the pos- terior face of the uterus and vagina a covering. The membrane then ascends upon the anterior face of the rectum, and spreads into two lateral folds. Between the uterus and rectum, a pouch is formed, similar to that between the bladder and womb, but it is much more distinct. The student wUl now understand a difficulty occa- sionally occurring to the passing of the catheter, viz.â€” a diversion of the urethra from its natural course. From the attachments between the viscera of the pelvis, by peritoneum, it is plain, that any thing which could cause a change in the natural position of the womb, would also tend to alter more or less the posi- tion of the bladder. When the uterus, dui-ing gesta- tion, rises in the abdomen, the bladder is earned upwards, and forwards; hence the urethra, instead of

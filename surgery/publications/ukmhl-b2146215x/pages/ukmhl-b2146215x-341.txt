311 ligaments. The digital joints have a capsular, and lateral ligaments. About the wrist, there are bursas mucosae, con- nected with the sheaths of tendons ; the disease, called ganglion, consists in a preteraatural accumulation of the natural secretion of the lining membrane of the bursa; and the carpus is a part of the body where this disease more commonly occurs, than any other. We are to be careful not to mistake one of these swellings for anemism. Mr. Burne has given a case in the Sixty-seventh Number of the *' Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, where this happened. The tumour was situated precisely in the course of the radial artery, it had an evident and general pulsation, and entirely disappeai-ed on the application of firm pres- sure; but on the removal of the pressure, it re-assumed its former size. Mr. Burne, and other Medical Men, pronounced it an aneurism. Subsequent examination, however, convinced them that the tumour was a ganglion, and that its gradual enlargement had raised the arteria radialis from its natural situation; the latte^ being found, on an attentive inspection, to pass over the swelling. These are the prefatory remarks which I deem essential prior to entering on the muscles, blood- vessels, and nerves. They may appear to the student as premature, as he cannot examine the joints until the muscles are removed; but I would ask, can he

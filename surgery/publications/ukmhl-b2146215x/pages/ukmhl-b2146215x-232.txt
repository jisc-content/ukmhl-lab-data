206 artery was wounded; but on referring to Portal's " Cours W Anatomie Medicale" I find the case related in a note Vol. HI. Page 183 ; (Burn's extract being taken from Vol. IV. Page 509.) The Pro- fessor's words are, " Un conseiller de la cour des aides fut atteint d''une violente esquinancie par Vin- flammation des amygdales; on crut reconnoitre uii abces dans Pune d^elles. Un chirurgien habile vou- lut d cet effet, Vouvrir avec le pharyngotome; mais it le dirigea si mal, ou Iart ere tonsillaire etoit si grosse, qa'ayant ete ouverte, il survint une hemorrhagie qui fut bientot mortelle:'' Thus it would appear, that we have not merely to apprehend the danger of open-l ing the carotid, but that the tonsil artery when wounded, may (if enlarged) give rise to fatal hoemor- rhage. In the generality of cases, however, we need have no dread of that extent of bleeding from the ton- sil arteries, which the actual cauteiy camiot suppress; but it is of vital importance that the operator should carefully avoid the carotid; this he may do by not dii'ccting the poiut of the bistouiy in the line of the angle of the jaw, but to pierce the tumour in front, and cai-ry the instrument directly backwai-ds. But in openiug a tonsillitic abscess, tx-ausfixing the blood-vessels is not the only gromid of feai-, another is suffocation from the discharge of its con- tents into the trachea; this has happened under the management of eminent Surgeons, who, for praise- worthy motives, have given publicity to the direful.

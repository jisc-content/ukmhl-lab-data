1" from objections in all its bearings; yet, a« affordmg the fundamental distinctions of Physiology, xt is regiuded as the most perfect system of the schools. After obsening that Life is " V ensemble des fonc^ Hons qui resutent a la Mortr which cannot be consi- dered as a definition of the thing itself, Bichat points out two remarkable modifications of this principle;-^ oftc common both to Vegetables and Animals,-the other, peculiar to Animals. Upon these distinctions be founds a classification of our functions; those which jwe have in commoji with Vegetables, he calls the 'tiinctions oi Automatic ox Orffanic Life, from being common to all organised matter. Those, on the other hand, which are proper to Animals, he names the fiinctions of Animal Life. By the organic iunctions only, an existence could be supported, because they are sufficient for vital purposes, from being subser- drient to nutrition and secretion; but the relation -which Animals have to external objects, renders it necessary that they should have the functions of Ani- mal Life, such as Seeing, Hearmg, Smelling, Tast- ing, and Touching, the power to reflect, to judge, and to will. It is true, Bichat gives us no real infor- imation on the principle of Life, nor does any other Physiologist; but that has not proved a barrier to the investigation of its laws. Buchan, the author of « BiONOMlA," remarks,—" the cause of gravitation ^remains unknov#n, but ignorance of that cause has been found no bar to the improvement of Physical Astronomy, which, founded u^on the acknowledged

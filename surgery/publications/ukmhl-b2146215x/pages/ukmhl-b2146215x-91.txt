67 distance of the vessel from the heart; the reason of which is obvious. At the adnlt age, in a state of health, the pulse is equal, regular, and has a mode- rate degree of power; but age, temperament, stature, and disease, occasion varieties in it. At birth, the nimiber of jjulsations in a minute, are about 140.—At the age of twelve months, 120.— At the age of two years, 110.—At the age of three years, 96.—At the age of seven years, 86.—At puberty, about 80.—At the adult period, 75.—And at sixty years of age, about 60. Persons of a sanguine temperament have gene- rally a quick pulse. Those of a melancholic tempe- rament, a slow one. Women have usually a quicker pulse than men; and dwai-fish than tall persons. In disease, the pulse is often much affected. The pulsations may be fi-equent, or slow; weak, or strong; full, or small; regular, or irregular; or intermittent. k f requent pulse is characterised by the pulsations being more numerous than they ought to be, in a given time. A slotv pulse is the reverse of this. In certain inflammatoiy diseases, and in those attended with much constitutional irritation, the pulse is fi-e- quent. In nervous fevers, and diseases of debility, the pulse is generally slow.

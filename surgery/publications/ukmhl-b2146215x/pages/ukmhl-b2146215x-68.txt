The muscular system is as litde liable to disease as any system of parts in the body; but it fm-nishes us with many signs of disorder in other organs. In vigorous and healthy persons, the muscles are firm; but in weak persons, they are soft and flabby. Theii- power is, in a general way, in proportion to their bulk; but a remarkable fact is obsei-vable in certain cases of lunacy, where the power of muscles seems to be extraordinarily increased. In fevers of low type, the power is much diminished; and in paralysis, it is altogether destroyed. Cramp consists in a spasmodic contraction of one or several muscles; this painful affection, when attendant on labour, is to be referred to the pressure of the child's head on the nerves distributed to the muscles of the tliigh. There is a species of cramp called tetanus, which is exceedingly dangerous. ^Tetanus is an involuntary and almost constant.con- c traction of all, or some of the muscles of the body, -while the senses are unaffected. It may be either idiopathic, or symptomatic. In most instances, it succeeds to punctured, and lacerated wounds, espe- cially when tendons and nerves are involved in the injury, and in these cases, the disease is often fatal..

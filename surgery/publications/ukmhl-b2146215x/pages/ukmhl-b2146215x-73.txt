49 have cousidered, as exceeding tlie power of matter. The experiments recently made by Mr. Brodie, and pnblished in Braude's, and other journals, are capable of settling the point of dispute, respecting the eflfects of the bile in the process of digestion, Mr. B. was disposed to think, that the bile is intended to convert the chyme into chyle, by a chemical change: but to ascertain whether he was right in this, he completely obsti-ucted the flow of bile into the duodenum, by a ligature on the ductus choledochus. The ligature, and the consequent want of bile, completely, and â€¢invariably, prevented the changing of a single particle of chyme into chyle; a process Avhich takes place at the entrance of the duodenum, and never higher than the pylorus; no chyle could be traced in the intestines, or in the lacteals; but both of these were filled with a fluid like the chyme, which became thicker as it proceeded, and at the termination of the ilium, it was '(juite solid, though not like faeces. The office then ^f the bile, is to convert chyme into chyle; and to act as the natural stimulus to the peristaltic action of the intestines. When the process of chylification is completed, two functions are set up in the intestinal canal; the one is, absorption of the nutritious part of the food; the other, dejection, or the evacuation of the residuum, or excrementitious portion, peranum: the former is accomplished by the lacteals; ihe latter, by the vermicular action of the intestines.

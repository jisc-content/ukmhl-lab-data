51 vegetable food is more proper than animal, for patients laboiu-uig under puti-id, and some other diseases. If healthy, and wholesome articles of food be taken, every morbid condition of the chyle must be owing to an undue action of the organs concerned in preparing it. We must, therefore, look to the diges- tive organs, and rectify their functions, 'ere the chyle can be improved in its properties. The next system, which is most intimately allied, in a physiological point of view, to the digestive, is the Absorbent System, which is composed of the absorbent vessels, and their appendages, called glands. The vessels are divided into lacteals and lymphatics; the former take their origin from the inner surface of the small intestines, as we have already stated: the latter arise from almost every surface, substance, and cavity of the body. The two sets of vessels pass through their respective glands, and at length unite to form trunks, which convey the chyle, and lymph, into the circulating mass of blood. The absorbents are supposed to have three coats, like the arteries and veins; but the delicacy of their structiu-e defies an accurate demonstration of them. They are named, elastic, muscular, and membranous. An absorbent vessel will not retain a cylindrical form when cut across; hence, the elastic coat must be weak. The existence of a muscular tunic is to be inferred from

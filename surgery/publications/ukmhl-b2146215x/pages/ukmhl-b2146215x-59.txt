35 seven tweuty-four ribs, twelve on each side. The uppermost proceed to the sternum, and by means of cartilages are joined to that bone; hence called true ribs. The fxve inferior on each side, do not reach the sternum, and on that account are named, false, or floating ribs. The dorsal vertebrae, behind, the sternum, before, and the libs, lateraUy, constitute the conical cavity, called thorax, which contains the heart, lungs, and other important parts. There are differences to be observed amongst the Ribs. Some ai-e more curved than others; their diminution in cm-vature being gradual, from the first to the last. From the first to the seventh, the ribs increase in length; and from the seventh to the twelfth, they decrease. The first rib is articulated only with the first vertebra of the back. The eleventh and twelfth have no tubercles, and the last, no fossa for the intercostal vessels and nerve. The Pelvis is a cavity, formed of bone; poste- riorly is the sacrum; at its apex, the os coccygis; and on the sides, and in front, are the ossa innominata. Above, it is expanded; beloAV that, contracted; then expanded again, to foi-m the cavity; and this termi- nates in an inferior opening, called the outlet. It contains the bladder, rectum, and other organs. Each Upper Extremity is composed of the shoulder, arm, fore-arm, and hand.

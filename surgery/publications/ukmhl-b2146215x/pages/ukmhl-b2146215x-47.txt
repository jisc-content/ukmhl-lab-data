"23 from a mucous to a cartilaginous state; and cai-tilage is the nidus in which the calcareous, or earthy material is deposited; the bones of the head excepted, where the nidus is membrane. The process of ossification now begins to be cognisable to the senses, and may be watched in its progress, to its full completion. The commencement of the third, or osseous state, is mani- fested by some changes which the cartilage or mem- brane undergoes. Vessels carrying red blood are seen running towards the ossifying points; the cartilage assumes a yeUowish hue; and bony fibres may be seen shooting in a longitudinal, or radiated course, accord- ing to the kind of bone in which the process is observed. In flat bones (as those of the cranium), there are two points of ossification, viz.—the centre, and the edge; the fibres from the centre shoot off in a divergent manner, to meet those which ]^roceed in a convergent direction, fi-om the circum- ference of the bone. The late Mr. Gibson, of Man- chester, was the first to describe, satisfactorily, the ossifying process in the bones of the cranium, and he published an ingenious paper on this subject, in the Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester. In the long, or cylindrical bones (as those of the limbs), there are three ossifying points, viz.—the body of the bone, and the two extremities; the latter are called epiphyses. In the spherical bones (as those of the carpus, and tarsus), there is only one point of

253 the spine on the internal surface of the lung (d), adaj^t- iug itself to the irreg-ularitics of the lobes. It then passes over the pericardium (e e); then on the inter- nal surface of the right lung (f); afterwai'ds on the external face of the same lung (g); and finally, on the right wall of tlie chest (h), to terminate behind the sternum where the reflection was begun. Thus the pleura is a complete bag without an apertui'e, and all the viscera of the chest are situated exterior to it. The mediastinum anterius contains the thymus gland, and cellular membrane; the mediastinum posterius en- closes the important parts, marked, F. G. H. and I. It is to be remembered that the pleura adheres closely to the walls, and organs of the chest, and that it is represented as separated irom them, merely for the sake of clearness. We have said, that the pleura is a secreting mem- brane, and that the fluid, or halitus, which it gives out, is for the purpose of preventing adhesion between its surfaces. During life and health, the exhalation, and absorption of this fluid are equal; thus the pleura is an absorbing, as well as an exhaling surface; and its fluid is never in excess; but inflammation materially affects the secretion; when excessive, the secretive function is susjjended, and then the surfaces of the pleura costalis, and pleura joulmonaris, adhere; when the inflammation is mild, the secretion is increased, and this is one of the causes of hydro-thorax.

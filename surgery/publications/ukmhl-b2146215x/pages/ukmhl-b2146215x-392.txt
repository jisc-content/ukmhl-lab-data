There is no surgical disease upon which more labour has been bestowed, than hernia. To recommend the student, therefore, to read aU the Works that treat on it, would be to impose a task on him, which would require almost a long life to accom- plish ; but he will not do justice to himself, if he neg- lects the perusal of certain modern Works, as those of the present century; amongst which, we must consider Cooper's, Scarpa's, and Lawrence's, as possessing su- perior merit. â–  ^ mi) ^f" I have not entered on the diseases with which herniae may be confounded; the contents of the sac; the nature of the reducible, irreducible, and the sti-an- gulated states of herniae; and the anomalous circum- Ttances which may present themselves; as information on these subjects must be derived from the souices referred to, n noii?

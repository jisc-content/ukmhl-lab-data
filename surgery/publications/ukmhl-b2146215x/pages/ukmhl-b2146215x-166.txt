142 covered with a valve; but this is not generally admitted. Although an aperture is not natural, an unentire state is not incompatible with the function of the membrana tympani; provided there be sufficient of it left to retain the chain of bones in their situa- tion ; but if these be displaced, deafness follows ; because the vibration cannot be continued. Beliind the membrana tympani is a cavity, called, the drum of the ear; across which, from the posterior surface of the membrane just mentioned to the mem- brane of the fenestra ovalis, is extended a chain of small bones, named, malleus, incus, os orbiculare, and stapes; with these, smaU muscles are comiected, by whose action the bones are moved, and the mem- branes, with which they are in contact, rendered tense, or lax M.Majendie considers these muscles as the instruments which tighten and relax the membrana tympani; but in a Paper, published in the <^ Jou.'nal i PMjsiologie Experimcntaler on this subject he shows, that muscular conti-action may be replaced by elasticity. He found, on examining the orga^zatiou of the eaa-, from the monkey downwards, that the muscles disappear, and are substituted by n.egul^ spherical bodies, of which one is comparatively lar e, belonging to the malleus, and the other much smaller, elected with the stapes. These bodies, Majendie has denominated, from theii-properties ->^'P^:^^ tnues r they are considered as acting by elasticity in keeping the membrane of the tympanum, and that the fenestra ovalis, in a state of tension.

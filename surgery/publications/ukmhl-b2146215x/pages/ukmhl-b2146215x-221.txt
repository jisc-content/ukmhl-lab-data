Nothing is more easy than to evert the eye-lid; it is to be done by means of a probe, which is pressed npon the upper surface of the lid, whilst the Surgeon, laying hold of the eye-lashes with his finger and thumb, draws them upwards. The next part of the appendages of practical importance, is the lachrymal apparatus, which we have described in a former part of the volume. The situa- tion of the sac, and duct must be well studied. The lachrymal sac, lodged on one half of the os unguis, is bounded above, by the tendon of the orbicularis muscle, and below, by the edge of the orbit.

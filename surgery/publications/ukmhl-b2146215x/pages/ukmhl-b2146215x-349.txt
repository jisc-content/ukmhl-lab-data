319 muscles wliich are likely to act on the broken portions, and which, if not relaxed, will prevent ihe easy coap- tation of the fraj^-ments, and the retention of them when coapted; this rule must indubitably be the best in all cases. We cannot put all the muscles in a state of repose, therefore must be content to command the most powerful; and then, by means of splints and banda^-es, to conti-oul the action of the rest. It is not only required of the Surgeon to set a fracture, but to guard against future derangement, which, in oblique breaches of the hone, is sure to happen without proper management. '^i ' Muscles, too, are the agents of displacement in dislocations, and in all cases they offer an obstacle to reduction. The muscles resist, and not the ligaments, for they are generally torn through. In reducing a dis- located bone, we relax the most powerfiil muscles, and fatigue, by unremitting extension, those which cannot be relaxed. One of the laws of muscular irritability is, that a state of rest must succeed to a state of action ; a muscle may be tired, but not if we allow alternate action and repose ; hence the injudiciousness of using sudden jerks in the reduction of a dislocated limb, and the necessity of keeping up a steady and continued extension. The student is now to dissect the arteries, veins, and nerves of the upper extremity, and to observe

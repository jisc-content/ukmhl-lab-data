100 tiiple phosphate, or amraoiiiaco magnesiaii phosphate; and oxalate of lime. Those composed of uric acid, arc known by their being laniiaiated, and having the ajipeai-ance of box-wood. Those composed of the tiiple phosphate, are white and fiiable; breaking between the fingers with the greatest ease. And those of the oxalate of lime, have an irregular sui-face; from which circumstance, they are named the mulben-y calculi. But there are some calculi composed principally of the phpsphate of lime; and others, of the carbo- nate of lime; hence, Dr, Henry has adopted the following classification, which seems to him, sufficient for every pvu'pose of arrangement. 1st.—Calculi which are chiefly composed of uric acid, or uj-£vte of ammonia. 2diy.—Calculi piincipally [composed of the am- niouiaco magnesian phosphate. 3aiy._Calculi consisting, for the most part, of phosphate of lime. 4tliy._Calculi containing, principally, carbo- nate of lime, StWy—Calculi which derive their characteristic property from oxalate of liuie.

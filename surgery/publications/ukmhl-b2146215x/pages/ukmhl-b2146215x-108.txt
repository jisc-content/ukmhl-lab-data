84 red, in inflammatory disorders; of a dark appearance, in adynamic affections; almost black, in scurvy; and very pale, in diseases of debility. There is a work yet left for the Chemist to accomplish ; which is, to ascertain, by analysis, the changes which different diseases effect in the properties of this fluid. We have seen that there are two orders of blood-vessels in the body, viz.â€”arteries, and veins. They differ from each other in the deusitj^ of their struGtui-e, and in the rapidity with wliich the blood ciiculates in them. The movement of the blood in the arteries, is much quicker than that in the veins; because the heart gives a much stronger impulse to it in the former vessels; and this is one of the soui-ces of greater danger from wounds of arteries. When called to a person who is. suffering fi'om haemorrhage, we should first ascer- tain whether the bleeding proceeds from a woxmded artery, or a wounded vein; observation on the coloui- of the blood, and the manner in which it flows, wiir soon enable us to determine this point. Arterial blood is scarlet; venous blood is quite dai-k; blood fi'om an artery issues per saltum, but that from a vein rushes in an even, unbroken stream. The importance of discrimination is great; for if an axtery, and vein of the same size were wounded, the one would require a ligature, but the bleed- ing in the other might be commanded by means of pressure. If a wound be inflicted in a' small

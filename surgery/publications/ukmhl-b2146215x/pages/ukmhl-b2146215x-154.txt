While examining the eyes of the soldiers in the garmson. Isle of Wight, an individual presented himself with the iris of the right eye of a grey, and that of the left, of a light green colour.

Dr. Smith found that the left had only changed to a green colour within the last seventeen months, from the consequences, it was supposed, of a severe blow. The posterior surface of the iris is dark, and radiated; the radii are named the ciliary processes. Sir Everard Home, in his " Croonian Lecture on the Anatomical Structure of the Eye" mentions, that he has ascertained, by the microscope, the radii to be eighty in number; and that in the interstices between them are bundles of muscular fibres, which pass from the capsule of the vitreous humour, to the capsiile of the lens. In the centre of the iris, is an opening, called, the pupil, which is round in the human subject; hori- zontal, in grazing animals; and vertical, in those of the cat kind.

296 reflect on the infiltration of urine in the ceUular mem- brane of the perinaeum, as being not an unfrequent cause of death after lithotomy; he must consider the parts to be cut in the lateral operation for stone, and the stages of the process; the new proposal, by M. Sanson, of cutting from the rectum into the bladder, which operation he calls the "recto vesical"; the operation of punctm-ing the bladder, from the rectum, for the discharge of urine in case of unmanageable obsti-uction in the natural pa:ssage; the nature of fistula, in periuajo; fistula in ano ; diseases of the rectum; and the treatment which they respectively require. Another examination of the pelvic viscera may now be made, by separating the left os innominatum at the sacro iliac junction, and sawing through the pubis, at a little distance from the symphysis; by thus removing one side of the pony pelvis, we obtain a lateral view. When the bladder is partially inflated from the ureter, and the rectum stuffed with hair or tow, the relation of these parts to others, will be more clearly seen. The ureter will be observed descending to the bladder; the vesicula seminalis lying neai- its cervix; the vas deferens passing downwards; the prostate gland sm-rounding the neck of the bladder; the mem- branous pai-t of the uretlu-a beyond it; and the tui-n- ings of the peritoneum can now be easily traced over the bladder and rectum.

348 be carefully cut, and pushed upwards with the haudle of the kuife, a thin fascia will be seen linings the posterior surface of the latter muscle; it is the fascia transversalis of Cooper. Below, it is .firmly attached to Poupart's ligament, and the pubis; and passing upwards, we find it between the posterior surface of the transversalis, and the peiitoneum. In this fascia, is the internal abdominal ring, by wlxich the cord leaves the abdomen. The tendons of the internal oblique, and transversalis, are not then perfo- rated for the passage of the cord, for the opening is in the fascia above mentioned, and the tendons io£i these muscles form, as it were, an arch over the corddl In tracing the cord, the student will observe it, in what is called the inguinal canal, viz.—that space between the two rings; that it is here situated behind the apo«i neurosis of the external oblique; and that it jjasses* under the edges of the internal oblique, and trans4o versalis muscles. At the internal abdombial rin^jfv (which is not a well defined opening, without breaking down the cellular membrane about it,) the spermatic cord is formed; and behind the ring is the peiitoneum, which lines the abdominal cavity; it is important to bear this in mind, as it explains the nature of the hernial sac. In the dissection, the student must observe thev epigastric artery. It arises from tiie external Uiac- and passes upwards, and inwards, towards the rectus muscle ; it is situated a little on the inner side of the

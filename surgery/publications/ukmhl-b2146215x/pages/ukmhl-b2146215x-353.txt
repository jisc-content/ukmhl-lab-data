323 structed au instrument, on a principle suggested by Mr. Kirby, an eminent Surgeon in Dublin. An idea of it cannot easily be conveyed in words; therefore, the plate of it, which is given in many Journals, must be consulted. Mr. Travers, and Mr. Brodie, have used it, and found it to obviate the difficulty alluded to ; in some recent cases, however, the common aneurismal needle has been found quite sufficient. The principal case requiring a ligatui-e on the subclavian, is aneurism of the axillaiy artery, which may be seated below the clavicle, or be extended to the subclavian artery itself. When we look to the anastomosing branches of the subclavian and axillary ai-teries, we find that the chance of success in tliis operation is less than that of tyhig many other arteries of the body; for the means of supplying the upper extremity with blood are, principally, limited to the inosculations between the supra scapular artery, which is a branch of the sub- clavian, and the infi-a scapular which arises from the axillaiy artery; and in the occasional variety, where the supra scapular artery springs from the axillary, instead of the subclavian, success is still more doubt- ful. But the apparent scantiness of the means by which the circulation can be can-ied on, after the main trimk is obliterated, ought not to deter us from performing the operation, for in many instances the

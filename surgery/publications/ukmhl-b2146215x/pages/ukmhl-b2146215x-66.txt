42 The functions of vision; hearing; speech; masti- cation ; deglutition; the circulation of the blood ; res- piration ; the faculties of standing; sitting; kneeling; walking; running; climbing; pushing; grasping; &c. are all dependent, more or less, on muscular power. Some of the muscles concerned in these purposes, are minute and delicate; as those of the eyes, ears, tongue, soft palate, and larynx; the rest, in a general way, a^-e more bulky, because the actions to be per- formed by them, ai-e of a more powerful and substan- tial kind. This outline of the uses of muscles may be filled up, by classifying the different muscles, accord- ing to their respective and combined actions; I adopt such an arrangement in my public lectures, as being the best mode of conveying useful instruction in this branch of Anatomy. The structures which enter into the composition of a muscle are, bimdles of fibres, which have a con- tiactile power; cellular membrane, which unites the fibres together; arteries; veins; absorbents; and nerves; and eveiy muscle, the sphincters excepted, terminates in a glistening structure, called a tendon. The Ancients supposed that tendon was nothing more than muscle hardened by pressure; but they possess nothing in common with each other, save the fibrous character, and the fibres are ligamentous, not mus- cular. Muscle is abundantly furnished witli blood- vessels; tendon, on the contrary, has little, or no vasculaiity; hence its weak living principle, and its

316 pectoralis major, were to contract alone, the fragment would be drawn upwards, or downwards, according to the muscle that is in action; but when both act at the same time, the bone is fixed at an intermediate point, in accordance with a well known law in mus- cular motion; and this is one of the reasons why the inner fragment is stationary; but there is another cause arising from the clavicle being joined to the sternum, and first rib, by means of strong ligaments ; hence the security is two-fold. I.et the student now cany his observation to the outer fragment, and he will find adequate reasons for its displacement. The clavicle is the chief support of the upper extremity; consequently, when broken, the arm falls, and carries the scapular exti'emity of the clavicle along with it; the fi-agment is thus lowered, and it is then drawn inwards by the subclavius muscle; these ai-e amongst the signs which indicate a fractui-ed collar-bone, and there is no difficulty in explaining them, after the ligaments and muscles, connected Avith the bone, have been properly examined. When the acromion scapuliE is fractured, the rotundity of the shoulder is lessened, and the form of it changed, because the arm falls, the deltoid muscles, or those fibres which arise from the acromion process^ pull the fragment downwards, and the levator sca- pula;, and upper portion of the trapezius muscle, elevate the body of the scapula.

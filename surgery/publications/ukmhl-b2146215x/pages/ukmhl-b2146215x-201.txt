177 The symptoms of concussion, whicli aceompany a fis- sure, or fracture of Uie bead, are not caused by tbat fissure, or fracture; for, as Mr. Bell observes, " tbey originate fi-om tbe injury which the brain received at the same time that the bone was hurt;" the fi'acture and concussion are, therefore, conjoint effects. The soui-ces of symptoms, furnished by injiu-ies,, or violence applied to the cranium, are two, viz.â€” concussion, and compression. By concussion, is meant a shock given to the brain by a blow; by which the functions of that organ are temporarily sus- pended, or permanently destroyed. The symptoms whicb denote a slight degree of concussion, are giddi- ness, ti-emor, paleness, nausea, and momentaiy insen- sibility. When the concussion is violent, there is a complete loss of sensibility and voluntai-y power; the skin is pallid and cold, and there is sickness, and a feebleness of pulse; this state of depression neai-ly resembles a state of syncope; but if the patient sui-- vives, sensibility and volition, in some measiu-e, return, the countenance becomes natural, the skin assumes its ordinary warmth, and the pulse rises ; this is what is called a re-action ; we are now to apprehend inflam- mation, and oui- ti-eatment must' be directed to the prevention of it by the appropriate means. Should depletoiy measures not succeed in preventing it, the patient dies from inflammation of the brain, or from the symptoms of concussion giving place to those of

252 thft pleuritic membrane, which secretes a halitus to lubricate the surface, and thereby to prevent the parts ■which are in contact, from adhering to each other. It is not only a lining, but reflected membrane; that is to say, it not only lines the walls of the chest, but gives a covering to the lungs and pericai-dium. The accom panying plan represents a view produced by an hori- zontal section of the thorax, and its contents; I have thought it necessary to give it, as there is nothing which perplexes students more than the reflection of membranes, and when represented to the eye in the form of a diagram, nothing is more simple. The pleura is a single bag without an opening; to demonstrate its course over the parietes of the thorax, and the viscera, the bag must be broken into, and the rupture is made at the stenium. A.—marks the spine. B.—The sternum. C. C. —The ribs. D.—The situation of the heart in its pericardium. E. E.—The lungs. F.—The aorta, G.—The oesophagus. H.—The vena azygos. I.— The thoracic duct. The reflection is to be commenced at (a),' behmd the sternum. From this point, the pleura goes to line the inner surface of the ribs on the left side (b), form- ing the pleura costalis. Having reached the spine, it is to be traced over the outer surface of the lung (c), I'ormiiig the pleura pulmoualis. It then returns to

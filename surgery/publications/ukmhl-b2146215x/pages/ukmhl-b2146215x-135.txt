Ill cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata; these parts are covered by membranes, called, dura mater, tunica ai-acbnoidca, and pia mater. The Cerebrum consists of two hemispheres, which ai-e separated by the falx major. The hemis- pheres are divided into lobes, and subdivided into convolutions. The Cerebellum is situated in the posterior fossae of the cranium; it has two lobes, formed by a process of the dura mater, named, falx minor; and the cerebellum is separated from the cerebrum, by means of another process of the same membrane, called, tentorium. The last part of the brain, is the Medulla Ob- longata, which lies upon the basilar process of the OS occipitis. The appearances worthy of notice in the cerebral mass, are, the corpus callosum; the cortical and medullary substances; the lateral ventricles; the cor- nua; the thalami nervorum opticorum; the corpora striata; the septum lucidum; the fornix; the plexus choroides; the foramen Mouroinum; the third ventri- cle ; the commissures of the third ventricle; the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum; the iter ad infundi- bulum; the tubercula quadiigemina; the infimdi- bulum; the pituitary gland; the corpora albicantia;

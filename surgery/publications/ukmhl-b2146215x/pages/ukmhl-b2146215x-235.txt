200 A,uatoiuy of the septum between the anterior and pos- jieriojq.cayity of the mouth, as is compatible with the £^design of this volume, I shall next describe the pos- •jterior cavity, or fauces, and the ducts, or passages J .opening .into, and proceeding from it. The parts which bound the space behind the velum pendulum palati, ai-e the following: on the fore part, above, we find the internal openings of the nosti-ils, and the irre- gulai-ities in them formed by the spongy bones; below, aie the velum pendulum palati, the aperture of com- munication between the anterior and posterior cavities, ^ and the base of the tongue; the view of these parts .can only be. obtained by separating the cervical ver- tebrsB from the back part of the throat; but this the student should defer doing imtil he has examined the other boundaries of the fauces. The posterior part is bomided by the bodies of the cervical vertebrae. The superior part by the basilar process of the os occipitis, and a part of the sphenoid bone. On each side, imme- diately behind the posterior openmgs of the nostrils, we observe the ti'umpet-like orifice of the Eustachian tube; below, the fauces terminate in the larynx before, and the pharynx behind; thus, the air, in entering the lungs, and the food, in its route to the stomach, must pass through this cavity. The space thus bounded has juiauy muscles connected with it, and it is lined by a continuation of the coimnon membrane of the mouth. In a former paa-t of the volume, I alluded to the manner in which the nostrils communicate with the 2d

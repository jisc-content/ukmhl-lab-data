284 Some anatomical writers have described this membrane as consisting of three parts, a middle, an inferior, and a superior; but this view is objectionable, as it does not give us an exact idea of its continuity. The peritoneum answers two important uses, viz.â€”to retain the viscera iji their situation, and to secrete a serous fluid, to lubricate the surfaces of the organs, and to prevent their adhesion to each other. The secretive function of this membrane may be af- fected by the same causes as those which affect the pleura. A morbid collection of its fluid is called ascites, and may arise from inflammation, debility, or organic I .disease. The operation of paracentesis is justiiied when the accumulation is so excessive as to occasion- urgent symptoms by its pressure, but it has only a palliative ^ueffect when the diopsy results from visceral disease. The student will now examine the relative posi- tion of the abdominal organs; he will observe the form, the transverse position, the surfaces, the curva- tures, and the extremities of the stomach; the extre- mity in which the oesophagus terminates, is called the cardia; that from which the intestines proceed, is named the pylorus. He will then follow the course of the intestinal canal, consisting of the duodenmn, jeju- num, and ilium, or the small; and the ccecum, colon and rectum, or large intestines. The duodenum is in great measure concealed until it emerges from the

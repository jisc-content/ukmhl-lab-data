124 of the conjunctiva angments the secretion of tears; but if that sensibility is too great, the secretion dimi- nishes, and ceases;" we cannot receive it as evidence, for we know that all the structures of the eye sympa- thize -with each other, and that this cause, or an extension of the morbid sensibility to the lachrymal gland, will be quite sufficient to occasion an aug- mented secretion of tears. We have already stated the effects of inflammation, when it attacks a glandular structure; and in a subsequent part of the volume, shall illustrate them in a more particular manner. We conceive then, that when the tunica conjunctiva is slightly inflamed, either sympathy, or a sjireading of the inflammation to the lachrymal gland, is the cause of increased secretion; and that a greater degree of inflammatoi-y action operating, mediately or immedi- ately, on the same organ, is the cause of its suspen- sion. The direct, and only source of the tears, seems to be the lachrymal gland; for we camiot see the necessity of there being any other provision. The last of the appendages of the eye are the muscles. The orbicular muscle smTounds the eye- lids, and, by contracting, shuts them. They are opened by the relaxation of this muscle, and by the action of the levator palpebrae superioris. From the bottom of the orbit, there aiise muscles, which are inserted into the sclerotica, and act on the ball of the eye. The adductor oculi dii'ects the ball towards the nose; the abductor oculi carries it outwai'ds; the

55 covered with a dense inorganic substance, called cuticle; the use of Avhich, is to blunt the acuteness of external impressions, which would otherwise prove painfid to the sensible cutis. The cuticle is spread over the orifices of the absorbent vessels, and thereby prevents absorption. Friction, however, raises the cuticle, and thereby exposes the orifices of the absor- bent vessels. When the skin is denuded, we remove the sole obstacle to cutaneous absorption. When we wish to introduce mercury into the system, in a more speedy manner than we can do by giving it internally, it is usual to apply a blister, and to dress the raw surface with mercurial ointment; a salivation will thus be often produced in a few hours. When we vaccinate, we insert the virus carefully under the cuticle; by doing so, we present the vaccine lymph to the mouths of the absorbent vessels. Thus we have a great controul over the lymphatics; and can^ by proper management, render them powerful auxi-^ liaries to the cure of disease. We have said, that the absorbent vessels pass through glands, in their route to the subclavian veins. It is of great consequence that the Surgeon should know the situation of these glands, and the absorbents which enter them; in order to trace the effects of irritation, and absorbed poisons. In the face, and neck, there are many absorbent glands in the course of the blood-vessels. In the upper extremity, there, are two, three. Or more glands, near the inner con-

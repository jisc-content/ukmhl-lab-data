41 to knoAV the peculiarities of the individual articu- lations; the student must therefore examine them; for they explain why one joint is more susceptible of luxation than another; why the head of a bone is thrown in one direction more easily than another; and why some kinds are more dilficult to reduce than others; this last generally depends on muscular obstacles; and muscles, as the agents of dislocation, and the opposing powers to reduction, wUl be considered in another division of the work. The bones and joints are the passive organs of loco-motion; the Muscles are the active organs, and by their influence, aU the animal and organic move- ments are performed. It is by muscular agency, that we go from place to place; and that the heart, and all hollow viscera, contract upon their contents. The human passions are expressed by the eyes; the eye-brows; the eye-lids; the lips; and certain appearances of the face; and the expression given to these different parts, are caused by muscles. These expressions constitute the language of gesture, which opens a path to this most interesting inquiry, how the emotions of joy, giief, melancholy, anger, &c. which depend on cerebral operations, are transmitted to, and characterised by muscular organisation. An inquiry replete with interest; but discouraging, from the diffi- culty there is in detei-mining the preliminary step, viz.â€”the seats of the passions. G

It is true that ou looking- up the nostrils of a basis cranii, which has been macerated and dried, we observe light through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone; but it is to be remembered, that in the living subject, these small apertures are filled with fibrils of the olfactory nei-ve, and that the pituitarj' membrane is in direct contact with the inferior, and the dura mater, with the upper surface of the cribriform plate. The impression, however, of any volatile, or acrid essence, can easily be transmitted from the nose to the brain ; it being by far the most direct passage. This fact exposes the danger of introducing very acrid substances into the nostrils. In my manuscript notes, taken at Sir Astley Cooper's Anatomical Lec- tm-es, I find mention made of a case, where phrenitis and death were brought on in a gentleman, by the Surgeon making use of a highly stimulant application^ for the cure of o^cena. I cannot conclude the surgical Anatomy of the ' nose, without making a few additional observations on the antrum maxillare, vel Highmorianum, a large cavity in the upper jaw-bone. On examining the antrmn in the diy bone, we find that the palate plate of the OS maxillare superius forms its floor, and that the first, second, and third molar teeth usually pene- trate into the cavity; or that if they do not, a thin plate of bone only is intervening. The roof of the antrum is formed by the orbitar plate of the bone; the 2 C

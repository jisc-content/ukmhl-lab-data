251 central line drawn perpeudicuhu-ly (considering the body erect) we see the pericardium, which co^tains the heart; and laterally, arc the lungs. The internal figure of the chest is conical; but the basis of the cone is not horizontal; the diaphragm being obliquely placed, so that the posterior part of the chest encroaches more on the abdominal cavity than the anterior; and this muscle is not flat, but convex. This muscular septum will be more particu- larly described when we speak of the parietes of the abdomen; but the student must, at this time, observe its relations to the thoracic viscera. On raising the sternum, the student would remark a ti-iangulax space, formed by the recession of the pleurae. When we say pleurae, it is not to be under- stood to mean, that there are two bags, for there is only one; but the term pleurae is made use of by some Anatomists to distinguish the plem-a of the right side, from that of the left. It is ti-ue, the chest is divided into two distinct cavities, but this merely arises from the attachments of the membrane to the sternum, before, and to the vertebrae behind; forming the two spaces, named, the mediastina: but here let me observe, the division between the right and left cavity of the chest is not exactly in the middle; as from before, back- wards, the septum passes with a degree of obliquity. The annexed diagram will point out the course of

from the brachial artery, in the relation nvhicJi that vessel most frequently bears to the cutaneous yeiiis..^,; The puncture of an artery in bleeding, gives rise to %vliat is called an aneurismal vai-ix, which is to be treated on the iDrinciple of woimded arteries. This ja one of the most formidable accidents attendant on venas-sectio ; but there are now and then other unplea- sant consequences; as inflammation of the vein, abscess, &c.; but I shall refer the student to W)Orfk.8 ,qn S,aj«v, gery, for information on these subjects.,. ,^„, - iffow The ulnar, radial, and interosseal arteries, in their com-se down the arm; their distribution in the hand; and their relation to the venee comites, and nerves, are next to be studied. The sviperficial palmar- arch is formecl by the ulnar artery; the deep arch by the radial. Between the two, there are free inoscula- tions: 1st.—Through a branch called, the superfi- cialis volae, which is given off by the radial artery, near the wrist, and traversing the palm of the hand, joins the superficial arch. 2dly.—By the radialis indi- cis, which anastomoses at the tip of the fore-finger, with the ulnaris indicis. 3dly.—By the ai-teria pro- funda volfB, which, after distributing branches to the interosseal muscles, and deep parts of the palm, ter- minates, by communicating with the ai-teria ulnaris profunda; thus, in whatever pai t, the ulnar, or radial arteries should be obstructed by ligature, there will remain ample resources for the circulation in the fore-

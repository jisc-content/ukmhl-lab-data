ON THE HUMAN BODY. The Human Body is composed of organs, and parts, dostiuod to perform the variety of functions essential to the life ivhich it enjoys. There are some iumiediately subservient to the faculty of loco-motion, viz-the bones, cartilages, ligaments, and muscles. In addition to this office, the bones support the solt pai-ts, and defend the vital organs (as the brain, heart, and lungs) from external injiu-y; and muscles, besides being the active agents of ti-ansporting the body from place to place, and of executing the different motions of theti-unk, extremities, and other pai-ts, operate the movements of the iinpoitant viscera. A digestive sys- tem is given to the body, to prepare the materials for its nutrition; a cii-culating system to carry nourish- ment to the different sti-uctui-es; secreting organs to form certain fluids, some of which fulfil important purposes in the animal ceconomy; a nervous system for sensation, voUtion, and sympathy, a reproductive system, for continuing the species; and ceUulax and other tissues, for the union and connexion of the whole. Thus the human body is constituted of many systems, not insulated, but essentially dependent; and we see in them, a wise and admirable adaptation of parts, to their intended uSes.

350 Inguinal hernise are of three kinds; the oblique, the direct, and the congenital. We have examined the natural parts connected with them, and found them to be, common integument; the fascia superficialis; the fascia of the spermatic cord; Poupart's ligament; the exter- nal abdominal ring; the internal oblique and transver- salis muscles; the fascia transversalis; the internal abdominal ring; the inguinal canal; the epigastiic artery; the spermatic cord; its cremaster tunic; and behind all these, is the peritoneum. In the female subject, the round ligament occupies the place of the spermatic cord, and the apertures are proportionally small; to which circumstance is atti'i- butable the infrequency of inguinal hernia in the female sex. To know the Anatomy of these parts, in their natural state, is an essential piece of knowledge to the student, but he must not forget that there is often a great dilFereuce between the Anatomy of parts in health, and in disease. Every one is aware of the effects of pressure in elongating extensible membranes, thus the peritoneum is carried before the viscera, and constitutes the sac of all herniae, (congenital excepted )j however large they may be. This membrane is not broken, as the Ancients erroneously supposed, hence the term " rupture," but actually pushed before the viscera. Common observation on pregnancy, and dropsy, is sufficient to convince us of the degree pf

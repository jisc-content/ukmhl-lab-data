Ml ciUeriug the Wyux: these observations must be reiuembered. ,lyn)iu! -.<'■ '■ !i To disteud the lungs from the uostiils, it is not absohitely necessary that the tube should be insinuated into the aperture of the lai-ynx. We may not always have a proper insti-ument at hand, and as what is to be done in suspended animation, must be done quickly, another method of operating must be employed. If we were to introduce a tube, or the nozzle of a pair of bellows into one of the nostrils, and blow; it is evi- dent that the air would not pass into the ti-achea, as the epiglottis closes the opening into it, and that some would escape through the mouth, some tlirough the nostril, and some pass into the stomach; to prevent these causes of failure, a finger must be put into the mouth, and the tongue drawn forwards, by this the epiglottis wiU be raised, and by approximating the lips around the finger, the aii- will be prevented from escaping per os; the opposite nostril to that occu- pied by the tube must be closed; and the fingers of an assistant must press back the thyroid cai-tilage upon the oesophagus, so that aii- may not pass into the stomach; there is now only one passage for the air, and that is into the lungs. Respiration is pai-tly a mechanical process; the parietes of the chest dUate, and the Imigs become distended by the pressure of the atmosphere; this is inspii-ation: the parietes then fall, and by pressing the limgs, the air is expelled; this is expiration.

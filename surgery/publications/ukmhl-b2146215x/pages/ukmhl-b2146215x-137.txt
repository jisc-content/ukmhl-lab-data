113 This is a too hasty opinion; and until more facts ai-e brought forward in support of it, we are not justified in adopting it. The Spinal Makrow is said, by most Anato- mists, to be a continuation of the brain; Gall and Spm-zeim, however, think differently. They say, that they are connected; not continuous. In its course down the vertebral canal, it sends off the spinal nerves, which are thii'ty-one pairs; and on reaching- the first or second lumbal- vertebra, it terminates in a bushy exti-emity, called, cauda equina, from its resemblance to the tail of a horse. Its coverings are the same, as those of the brain. The Nerves are whitish cords, composed of fibres, which aj-e vmited together by fine membrane, and enclosed in a cellular sheath. They are furnished with blood-vessels, &c., like other organised parts. The nerves, like the arteries and veins, pass into the different sti-uctures of the body, and are often seen in company with them; but there are textures, in which arteries and veins can be easily demonstrated, but where no vestige of nerves can be detected; and, according to the experiments of Ilaller, Portal, and other Physiologists, these parts do not evince the, least degree of feeling. Are we to infer from this, that they do not possess nerves ? Q

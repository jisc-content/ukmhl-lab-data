194 The principal appendages of the eye are situated superficially, they are the eye-brows, eye-lids, eye- lashes, the tunica conjunctiva, and the apparatus con- cerned in the secretion and discharge of the tears. Some of these parts are visible, and can be demon- strated without the aid of dissection; but there are others that cannot be. The luiife is required to display the lachrymal gland, and sac; and to show the ductus at nasum, we must break through bone; the com- mencement, course, and termination of the duct may, however, be shown without this ti-ouble. The reflection of the tunica conjunctiva is a point of Anatomy well deserving of attention. The student will find, by everting the upper and under eye-lids, that this membrane does not merely give a covering to the surface of the eye, but after running a little back- wards, it is reflected so as to line the lids; thus, it connects the globe of the eye with the lids, and pre- vents exti-aneous matters fi-om passing beyond a cer- tain point. It often happens, that the eye is much pained by the presence of dust, or gritty matter; but as on superficial examination, the soiu'ce of ii-ritation cannot be detected, the eye is pronounced inflamed, although the inflammation obstinately resists the com- mon treatment. I have seen very disti-essijig cases of this kiud, and one of them, which occurred when I was a pupil, made a strong impression on my mind. In tliis case, the cause was not suspected; the eye assumed the usual appearance of inflammation, aud.

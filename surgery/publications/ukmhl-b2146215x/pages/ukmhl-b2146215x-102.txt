78 goes to the rii^ht, the other to the left lung. At the upper part of this tube is the larynx, or organ of the voice. The Larynx is composed of cartilages, liga- ments, muscles, &c. The cartilages, are five in number, and named, the thyroid, cricoid, two aryte- noid, and epiglottis. The ligaments of the voice are four. A ligamen- tous cord passes from the fore pai-t of each aryte- noid cartilage to the anterior angle of tlie thyroid. By these ligaments, an opening is left, which is called the rima glottidis. Under the cords just mentioned, Ave find two others, taking their origin from the bases of the arytenoid cartilages, and running, like the for- mer ligaments, to be inserted into the thyroid cartilage. Between the superior and inferior ligaments, we see, on each side, a pouch, named, the venbicles of the lai-ynx. The muscles are small, but numerous; by them, the cartilages and ligaments are acted upon, so as to effect their straightening and expansion, for the modu- llation of the voice. ' The voice is foi-med by the air, in its exit from the lungs, causing a tremor of the cartilages, and ligaments of the larynx. The strength of it is in proportion to the quantity of air expired, and the size

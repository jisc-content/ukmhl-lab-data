50 The LacTeals arise from the Inner surface of thâ‚¬ small intestines by orifices, not visible to the naked eye in the human subject; and fi'om their origin, they pass to the MESENTERIC Glands. The lacteal vessels which enter the glands, are named, vasa lactea primi geneiis; those passing out of the glands, are called, vasa lactea secundi generis. What change the chyle undergoes in these glands is not known; but they are supposed to add to it a secreted fluid, by which the chyle is inore assimilated to the blood. From the mesenteric glands, the lacteals go to the thoracic duct, in which they terminate. This duct begins at or near the first Ixmibar vertebra; it ascends on the left side of the spine, and ends in the left subclavian vein, at the place where it is joined by the internal jugular. J : Thus, the organs which constitute the digestive system, are sabsei-vient to various purposes; and on the due performance of each of them depend the nutrition, health, and energy, of the body. ^ The chyle, or product of the aliment after it has undergone digestion, is found, on analysis, to be' composed of water, albumen, fibrine and saline par- ticles ; but there are some differences in the constituent parts and properties of this fluid, as abstracted fi-om animal, and vegetable substances. Animal chyle contains more solid materials; hence, is more nutri- tious; but vegetable chyle iis less puti-escent; hence,

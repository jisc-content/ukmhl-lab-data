317 To restore the acromion to its natural situation, the deltoid, and the other muscles, must be relaxed. The sign which denotes a fracture of the coracoid process, is an inclination of the arm foi-wards, and downwai-ds; the pectoralis minor muscle, which is inserted into the fragment, and the short head of the biceps and coraco brachialis, which take theii- origin fi'om it, are the agents of displacement. t ' "When the inferior angle of the scapula is broken thi-ough, the portion is di-awn forwai-ds by the action of the serratus major anlicus muscle. : ;i .When an oblique fracture happens at the upper part of the os humeri, above the insertions of the pec- toralis major and latissimus dorsi muscles, it is easy to conceive what the derangement would be. The muscles just alluded to, from being implanted into the lower fragment, would pull it inwards, and the teres major would di-aw it a little upwards. Should the bone be bi-oken lower down, the displacement would be much less, owing to the firm attachment of the brachialis internus, both above, and below the fractui-e on the fore part, and that of the triceps on the back part of the os humeri. Occasionally, the olecranon ulnae is snapped off by the spasmodic contraction of the triceps muscle; but it is more frequently fractured by a direct blow.

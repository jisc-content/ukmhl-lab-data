After having raised all these layers in succession, we come to the true hernial sac. He states this.tunic to be a prolongation of the cellu- lar tissue which covers all the exterior of the perito- neum; and that when the subject is embonpoint, the tunic is charged with fat, like that which unites the peritoneum to the abdominal muscles. The fascia cellularis of Scarpa, then, is another tunic in oblique hemia, and. this constitutes the fifth coveruig of the, sac,,. .^^ );• The relative position of the spermatic cord, and ^jjigastric arteiy is thus: the former is placed ordina- rily behind the hernial sac, but there are some excep- tipns to this rule; and the foundation of one excep- JijOn, yiz.—the division of the constituent parts of the ^qrd^ .iSj noti difficult to explain, when Ave knoAv that t^ey come from different directions; thus the bloods Vessels descend to the internal rinsr, and the vas defe- ^ens ascends from the pelvis; therefore, the compo- nent parts of the cord may be split by the force of protruding viscera, and consequently, sometimes the blood-vessels may be found on the anterior, and the vas deferens, on the posterior siuface of the sac. The epigastric artery is a little ou the inner side of the internal ring ; thus in oblique inguinal hemiaj it is on the pubic side of the mouth of the hernial sac. -i-^^

75 his experiments, and the fact has been confirmed by after experimenters, that vegetables act in an opposite manner on the atmosphere to what we do; instead of absorbing oxygen, and emitting carbon, they emit oxygen, and absorb carbon; thus, the animal and vegetable kingdoms are subservient to the well-doing of each other. To illustrate fiulher the wise provision furnished by nature, I shall extract a passage from Dr. Curry's Observations on Apparent Death: " To Dr. Priestley," he says, " we owe that beautiful discoveiy of the mutual support which the animal and vegetable creation afford to each other, viz.—that animals, whilst dissolving, and putrifying after death, set loose in the atmosphere, a great quantity of nitrogen gas, which, if augmented beyond its due proportion, would tend to destroy those that still live; but that this gas is greedily absorbed by growing vegetables, which retain and fix its basis as a part of their substance, whilst they give out, in exchange, a quantity of vital air, which, in its turn, is necessary to the mamtenance of respiration, and animal life." We have seen that the constituent parts of atmos- pheric air, are oxygen, nitrogen, and caibonic acid gas, besides adventitious materials; the proportions in which they are combined, are nearly thus—22—77— and one; although some chemists have given different results; but not, however, widely different.

286 intestinal canal, liver, pancreas, and spleen, the stu- dent will acquaint himself with the situation of the kidnies, ureters, and urinary bladder; this last organ is situated in the pelvis, where it is connected with the rectum in the male, and with the uterus, and its appendages, in the female. All the abdominal organs derive their arterial blood from arteries coming off from the aorta. The caeliac supplies the stomach, liver, pancreas, and spleen; the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries supply the small and large intestines; and the renal, or emulgent, furnish blood to the kidnies. The nerves are derived from the par vagum, and grand sympathetic; plexuses are fomid near the origin of the arteries, and from these the nerves pass off to the different organs. All the viscera of the abdomen are liable to in- flammation, and its consequences, but some of them are subject to particular morbid changes. Inflammation may be occasioned by a variety of causes, but some organs are exposed to it from situa- tion, and function. The stomach, for example, from being the receptacle of what we eat and drink, is more susceptible of being abused than any other organ, and with truth it may be asserted, that it is the nursei-y of more diseases, than any other viscus.

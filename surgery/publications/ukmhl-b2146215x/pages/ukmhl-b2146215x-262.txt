236 lage; still lower the cricoid; and then the rings of the trachea. A little below the cricoid cartilage Ave find the thyroid gland, consisting of two lobes ; it is sup- plied by four considerable vessels, two of which origi- nate from the subclavian, and two from the external carotid arteries. When the thyroid gland is of its natural size, it lies a little below the cricoid cartilage; but when augmented in bulk, by bronchocele, or the Derbyshire disease, so called from its being endemic in the County of Derby, it extends upwaids, so as to covier the thyroid cartilage; laterally, so as to derange the natural position of paits; and downwards, so as to encroach upon the large vessels which arise from the arch of the aorta. When we observe the relation of the lobes of the thyroid gland to the carotid arteries, we should sup- pose, and in the majority of cases om* supposition would be correct, that the vessels would be situated behind the tumom-; but an instance has occm-red in my practice lately; where, in an aged female, the carotid arteries were thrown considerably out of their course. When I first saw the tumour, I observed on each side, at the exti-eme point of its lateral region, a movement of the integuments; and on applying my finger to the part, I found a strong pulsation; the vessel was superficial, and the dimension of it was neariy equal to the size of my little finger.

109 prominent or depressed points, these Anatomists have had in view, the demonstration of minute structure; by which they profess to have gained a more satisfac- tory clue to the functions of the cerebral organ. They have shown that the bram is fibrous, a circumstance lost sight of in the ordinary method of dissecting it; and for the same reason, that the fibrous structure of an apple caiuiot be observed, when smoothly cut. There is one fact which deserves notice, because it is corroborative of Gall and Spurzeim's opinion on the real structure of the brain, and the connection between its structure, and its functions; a fact which defies proof by the common mode of dissection. It has been confirmed, by examining bodies, after death, that when hemiplegia is the result of cerebral lesion, the paralysis is on the opposite side of the body to the seat of disease in the brain. In following the fibres of the medulla oblongata. Gall and Spurzheim discovered a decussation of them; that is to say, the fibres of the right side of the brain passed to the left side of the body, and vice versa; and this affords an easy solu- tion of the pathological fact alluded to. It would appear then, that the fibres transmit the nervous influence; and if so, it is more scientific to trace them from their source to their destination, than to dissect the brain, with the intention of exposing eminences and depressions in its cavities and sub- stance ; I shall say nothing, however, on their physio- logical theory, with regard to the individual functions, of individual portions of the brain.

184 are connected with the apj^endages of the eyes, with the aliB of the nose, with tlie upper and lower lips, and the angles of the moiith. Under natural circum- stances, the inouth is in a transverse line, this is owing to the muscles on one side of the face being equally antagonized by those of the other; but if any thing happens to give greatei' poAver to those on one side, than to those on the other, the mouth is rendered awry, or oblique. Pain in the face, from an aifection of the facial nerve, or from the ii-ritation of a diseased tooth, will often cause a preteraatui-al iiTitabilitj' of the muscles on the affected side, and during the pa- roxysm of pain, a convulsive motion will be observed, which, from habit, will sometimes continue, after the pain has subsided. The deformity which frequently occurs m the mouth, after an attack of hemiplegia, is attributable to the muscles not being antagonized. A person receives an injury on the right side of the head, which tlirows him half paralytic; we find, in this case, a di-awing upwards of the left angle of the mouth; and the left arm and leg pai-alyzed. How are these symptoms to be explained ? The injm-y exists on the right side of the brain. The left corner of the mouth is drawn upwai-ds, because the muscles on the right side of the face, ar* palsied. The arm aiid leg, on the opposite side to the injury of the brain, are paralyzed, in consequence of the nervous fibres decussating each other in the medulla oblongata; thus, the fibres of the right side of thÂ§

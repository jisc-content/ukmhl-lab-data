58 sanguiferous, or circulating system, consists of the heart, arteries, and veins; to which we shall add the lungs; because circulation and respiration are closely allied functions. I The Heabt is of a conical figure, and lies obliquely in the thorax, inclining to the left side. Its form justifies a division into base, body, and apex. From the base goes off the aorta, or principal trunk of the ai-terial system. This organ has four cavities: an auricle, and ventricle, on the right side; and an auricle, and ven- tricle, on the left; and with these, large vessels com- municate. Into the right aui'icle, the vena cava descendens, vena cava ascendens, and coronary vem open; and there is an apertui-e of communication with the right ventricle. In the right ventricle are two openings; one from the auiicle; the other into the pulmonary artery. In the left auricle, we observe the enti-ances of the four pulmonary veins, and a hole into the venti-icle; and in the left venti-icle, we find the opening just spoken of, and another, leading to the aorta. The structure of the heart is muscular; but its substance is not uniform in thickness; the reason of which is obvious. It seems to be a law in nature, that no part of the Animal (Economy shall be endowed with more energy than is necessary for the

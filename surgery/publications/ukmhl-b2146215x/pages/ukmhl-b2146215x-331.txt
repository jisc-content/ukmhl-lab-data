301 actual dimensions. Let, however, three inches be the space through which a foetal head can pass, and we shall be able to form a pretty good idea of the pressure which the bones of the cranium must experience, and of the diminution in size which the whole head must undergo, in order to be propelled through the aper- tures of the pelvis. We may infer, from these facts, how desirable it is, that we should possess the means of judging whether there is sufficient space in the pelvis for the head to pass, without that artificial assistance which is incompatible with the life of the child: instruments, called pelvimeters, have been in- vented for the purjjose, but they are uncertain, and therefore seldom used in this country; we must subf scribe to the opinion of the able Accoucheiu's, Haigh- ton and Burns, that the hand is the best pelvimeter; the size of the pelvis being determinable with tolerable accuracy, by the number of fingers that can be passed into its different parts. The female pelvis is a subject which might lead us to extend our remarks; but the reader must consult Works exclusively devoted to the obstetric art. I must here recall to the student's recollection, the observations which we made on the soft parts bounding the pelvic cavity; they apply equally to the female as to the male subject; but in the viscera there is a difference. The organs of the pelvis in the female are, the urinary bladder, the uterus and its appendages, and the rectum.

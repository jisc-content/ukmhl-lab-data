mm from being superficial, and projecting at the malleoli; the accident is often compound. The tibia may be thrown in any dii-ection, but the dislocation Inwards is most frequent. As the gastrocneniii muscles are in- serted into the os calcis; it is necessary, in reducing the tibia, that these muscles be relaxed, by bending the knee. Between the first and second row of tarsal, as between the fii-st and second row of carpal bones, we find a perfect joint. It is formed, above, by the astra- galus, and OS calcis; and below, by the os naviculare, and OS cuboides : the astragalus is opposed to the os naviculare, the os calcis to the os cuboides, and tbe articulation between them is nearly in the same trans- verse line. The tarsal-bones are united to each other by capsular ligaments, and ligaments passing from bone to bone. The metatarsal bones are fixed to the tarsal by capsular, and to each other, by interosseal liga- ments. The toes, like the fingers, have capsiilar, and lateral ligaments. In the lower extremity, as in the upper, the student must make himself acquainted with the points of bones neai- the joints, which can be felt through their fleshy covering. He should particularly observe the relative position of the trochanter major, as this will assist him in detecting accidents of the hip-joint. The student is next to dissect the muscles, which may be classed according to their uses. 2 u

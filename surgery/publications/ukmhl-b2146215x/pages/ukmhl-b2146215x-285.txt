257 expediency of the operation. When we have two evils to contend with, viz.—the imminent danger, in Avhich a person lahouring under hydro-thorax is placed, and the possibility of exciting inflammation in the pleura, by inflicting a wound in it; there can be no doubt of the justifiability of hazarding an opera- tion. We have only to fear two things, viz—a wound of the intercostal arteiy, and inflammation; the first may, in a general way, be avoided, by tlividing the intercostal muscles at the vpper edge of the seventh rib; for the arteiy, vein, and nerve, occupy the lower margin : there are, however, some exceptions. I have seen the vessels ruiming intermediately between the ribs; but certainly never near the upper edge. With ren-ard to the inflammation which may ensue, if great, ■n e can commonly check it by depletion; if trifling, it may have a beneficial effect in efiusion from chronic inflammation, by changing the action of the vessels; for instances are not wanting to show, that an acute disease will often cure a chronic one, and it is this law in Pathology, upon which, injection for the radical cure of hydi-ocele is founded. With regard to the expediency of the operation, this is more difficult to determine. Could we posi- tively ascertain that the Avater, or pus, arose from a disease of the pleura only, no Surgeon would hesitate to operate, for many instances of cure are recorded; but when there is organic disease in the heart, no good is likoly to result from the operation, and there-

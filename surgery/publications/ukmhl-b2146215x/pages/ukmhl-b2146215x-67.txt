43 tendency to slough, or mortify, on being wounded, punctured, or otherwise injiu-ed. Muscles are exqui- sitely sensible; tendons, on the other hand, are almost devoid of this faculty; they may be cut, or torn, with- out the animal expressing the slightest degree of pain. Muscle, and tendon, therefore, are not the same, but very different structures. The principle of muscular motion is irritability, of the nature of which, we know as little as we do of life; but there are certain laws of this principle, which we may consider as established; thus, experiments, and obseiTation, fully prove that a muscle cannot long remain in a state of action; therefore, firstly, a state of rest must succeed a state of action. Secondly; every irritable part loses a portion of its irritability by action. Thirdly; by repose, it regains the portion which it lost. Fourthly; all irritable parts are not endowed with the same share of irritability. The heart is the most imtable of all animal structures; next, the intestines; the stomach; the urinary bladder; the muscles of respiration; the voluntary muscles; the arteries; the veins; and lastly, the absorbents. Fifthly; the degree of action produced by a stimulus^ is (caeteris paribus) in proportion to the power of the stimulus. And Sixthly; the action of every stimulus is in an inverse ratio to the frequency of its appli- cation. There are other confirmed laws of this extra- ordinary principle; but the six above mentioned, are most familiar to us; as facts, illustrative of them, are

82 Berzelius' Analysis is nearly similar. Seimm differs from chyle, in having no white particles. The crassamentum is composed of two sub- stances; fibrin, and red globules. The nature of fibrin is well known ; but that of the red globules, or colouring matter of the blood, is still a contested point amongst Chemists. It was believed that the red colour of the blood depended on the iron wliich it contained; but the opinion has been rendered ques- tionable by the experiments of Mr. Braude. From them, it is to be inferred that the colouring principle is an animal substance of a peculiar nature; suscep- tible, like the coloiu-ing matter of vegetables, of vmiting with bases, and admitting, probably, of important use in the art of dyeing. The blood drawn in inflainmatoiy diseases, shows a division of the two component parts of the crassamentum. What we call the " huffy coat" is pure fibrin, which is separated from the red particles, in consequence of a subsidence of the latter, whose specific gravity exceeds that of any other material of the blood. In inflammation, the blood is attenuated, and coagulates slowly; there- fore, time is given for the red globules to sink below the fibrin, and this is the explanation of the pheno- menon of the " hnffy coat." The blood is the material used in the formation of new parts, and in the restoration of those injured by accident and disease. Duilng the continuance of

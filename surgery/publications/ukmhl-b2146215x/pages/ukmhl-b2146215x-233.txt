207 catastrophe which they witnessed. The natural infe- rence, which we should be induced to draw is, that such an accident is occasionally unavoidable. Inflammation of the tonsil gland sometimes ter- minates in chronic enlargement; I have seen several cases of this soi't. I have also fi'equently seen too, an enlarged and indurated state of the gland to succeed to suppiu-ation. This disease often yields to blisters; but from the unpleasant, and even painful sensation which the patient complains of as attending it, a removal of the whole, or a part of the tumoiu", by caustic, the actual cautery, ligature, or excision, is sometimes obliged to be resorted to. With regard to the caustic, I believe it to be, in the majority of cases, totally inefficacious. The actual cautery, cai'efully conducted to the tumoiu-, promises success. Excision is often attended with the loss of so much blood as to excite alarm; I have been jjresent at two oj)erations by exci- sion ; in one, the bleeding was inconsiderable ; in the other, performed by Baron Larrey, the blood flowed so freely, that the operator was induced to apply the actual cautery, in order to resti-ain it. With respect to sti'angulating the tumom*, by passing a ligature about it, this is certainly the safest operation; and managed as Mr. Grainger, the father of the Lectm-er, of the Borough, has pointed out in his " Medical and Sur- gical RemarJis,'''' published in 1815, an operation not difficult to perform. After mentioning the different methods which have been proposed by Want, Chesel-

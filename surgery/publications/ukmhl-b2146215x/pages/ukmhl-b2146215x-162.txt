138 artificial one, by the melhod of Cheselden, Scarpa, Gibson, Adams, or Ware. Opacity of the lens, from effused lymph behind the capsule, must be treated by introducing a needle, and puncturing the capsule, so as to allo^v the aqueous humour to have access to the lymph, by which it will be dissolved, and subsequently absorbed. The aqueous humour has a powerful solvent property; on a knowledge of which is founded the treatment of soft and milky cataract, and the late method recommended by Sir WiUiam Adams, of treating hard cataracts, viz.-by cutting the lens into small portions, and placing them in the anterior chamljer of the eye. Analysis teaches us nothing on what the solvent property of the aqueous humoiu- depends; for the most active ingredient which it contains, is muriate of soda; but that it is endued with this power m an extraorcUnaiy degree, is proved by a cii-cumstance ^vhich occun-ed to Mr. Cline, seni-. He was operating for cataract, a spasm seized the eye after the needle was introduced, and a portion of it snapped off. Bad consequences were apprehended; but, to the great gratification and astonishment of the Sui-geon, the fragment of the needle was dissolved, and aftemards absorbed. This interesting fact is mentioned by Sill Astley Cooper in his Anatomical Lectures. Besides Sir Williaan Adams' operation, which is not, I believe, very extensively practised in hai-d

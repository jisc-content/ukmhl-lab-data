lU I believe that there is no organized part of the human body completely destitute of nerves; by organized part, I mean, no living part. The cuticle, the nails, the hairs, have not any; but these are not living structures; they are merely secretions, and excrescences from living sti'actures. The bones, peri- osteum, eai-tilages, tendons, and membranes, com- monly ranked amongst parts devoid of sensibility, are not wanting nerves; we cannot trace them in either of these substances; but disease proves their existence. In mflamraation of bone, peri- osteum, the dura mater, pleura, and peritoneum, there would be no pain if there were no nei-ves ; as it is, no diseases are accompanied with more agonizing pain than pleuritis, peritonitis, &c. hence nerves must be present, although minute anatomy cannot show them. It may be laid down as positive, that no organized part is without nerves ; ljut in some struc- tures, they are more munerous than in others ; hence, their different degrees of sensibility. How nerves terminate is a matter of conjecture in many cases; but we well know how a few are disposed of. Thus, the olfactory nerves spread on the pituitary membrane of the nose, to give us the sense of smell; the optic expand to form the retinae; the auditoi-y nerves line the walls of the labyrinth of the ears, for the sense of hearing; but how the nerves entering the viscera, mnscles, &c. end, we cannot positively de- termine.

The cutis vera is one of the three tunics which cover the body. On the surface, is the dense inor- ganized cuticle ; and intervening, between it and the cutis,, is the rete mucosum. The integuments of the body are reflected inwards, so as to line certain passages, as the nosti-ils, mouth, oesophagus, ti-achea, m-ethra, vagina, and a part of the rectum. The cuticle and rete mucosum, are believed to be secretions of the cutis vera. This last is an exceedingly vascular membrane; it is also plentifully supplied with absor- bents ; as shown by quicksilver injections. The cutis is a very sensible structure; and but for the cuticle and rete mucosum, the impressions of tactile bodies, could scaixely be endured; this is proved by the acute pain experienced, when these external coverings are removed. I But the sense of touch, is not the only function of the cutis; it is also a secretive organ, and supposed by some Physiologists, to eflTect the same changes on the atmosphere, as the lungs; but there is a doubt about this point. The eminent Chemists, Allen and Pepys, made some experiments, with a view to deter- V

269 may, therefore, infer what mischief would accrue from theii- continuity heing destroyed. It has been proved, in a satisfactory manner, that if one of these nerves be cut across in the neck, the injury is not always mortal, but that the animal soon dies after the division of both; that if one nerve only be divided, the lungs and stomach are impaii-ed in their functions, but they soon recover them: that the section of both nerves, affects the lai^nx, the heart, the lungs, and stomach; and the animal dies asphyxied. Different explana- tions have, however, been given by different Physio- logists, of the cause of death, after dividing the par vagum; but the post mortem appeai-ances incline us to the opinion that asphyxia is the proximate cause. To prove the influence of the phrenic nerves on the action of the diaphragm, it is only necessary to watch the effects of pricking, ii-ritating, and dividing them. By pricking them with a pin, or scalpel, or irritating them by means of some acrid fluid, the ,muscle contracts. If the nerves be divided, the dia- phragm is paralyzed. The diaphragm, as we have said, is the principal agent in respiration; the other organs are the inter- costal muscles, the abdominal muscles, &c. All these parts are provided with nerves from the spinal marrow. If the spinal maiTOW be divided above the third cer- vical vertebra, the respiratory function is put a stop to. If the division be made low in the neck, the inter-

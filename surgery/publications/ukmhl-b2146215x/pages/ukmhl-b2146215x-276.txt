250 and the piincipal of them are imited anteriorly to the sternum, by means of intervening cartilages. The student must examine the processes, and remarkable points in the bony paa-ts of the thorax; he must observe how the muscles before and behind are expanded upon the ribs, and the protection thus afforded against fractures, ai>d how they may affect the walls of the chest, when their insertions are fixed. Between the ribs he will find the two layers of inter- costal muscles; and there are other muscles, with the uses of which he must make himself acquainted. On noticing the ribs in their mode of junction^ ivith the sternum, with the vertebrae, and with each other, it must be evident that in case of fracture, the broken exti-emities can only be displaced inwards, or outwards; their connection, before and behind, prevents any derangement in length; and the fragments cannot be carried either upwards, or downwai-ds, on accoxmt of the intercostal musculai- fibres acting equally above, and below the extremities of the broken bone. Tlie thoracic cavity is shut out from the neck, by the muscles and blood-vessels going to, and returning from the neck, head, and upper extremities; and below, from the abdomen, by the diaphi-agm. Having raised tjie sternum and cartilages of the ribs, we obtain a view of the viscera of the chest, invested by their pleuritic membrane. Inclined to the left, from a

278 of the ilium, and Poupart's ligament, to their tendi- nous exijansion, which, with the exception of the inferior part, goes to the linea alba, behind the rectus. From the internal oblique and transversalis, some pale fibres go to the spermatic cord, constituting the cremaster muscle. How then is the sheath of the rectus muscle formed? is the question which the student will ask himself; the answer is easy. Dividing the recti mus- cles into fouiths, the upper three-fouiths of their sheaths will have the aponeurosis of the external obli- que, and the anterior layer of the internal oblique on their fore part, and the posterior layer of the internal oblique, and the aponeurosis of the transversalis be- hind. At the inferior fourth, all the aponeuroses pass before the sheath, hence at this part the peritoneum only lines the posterior surface of the recti muscles. The recti muscles are now to be dissected, by turn- ing back the fore part of theii* sheath; the line^ trans- versales will then be fully exposed; and in front of the recti, in the same sheath will be seen the fifth pair of muscles called, from their figure, the pyramidales. If one of the recti muscles be now divided across, and the two extremities reflected, the student wiU be able to observe the peculiar disposal of the aponeiux)ses, by which the muscle is surrounded. It is only from knowing the direction which the fibres take, that any idea can be obtained of the purposes to which the

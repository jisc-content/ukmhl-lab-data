ABDOMEN. The abdomen consists of two parts; the abdo- men, properly so called, and the pelvis. It is a cavity formed, above, by the diaphragm; below, by the soft pai-ts of the outlet of the pelvis; on the fore part, and laterally, by the abdominal muscles; and behind by the lumbar vertebrae, vertebral muscles, and sacrum. The viscera, which the cavity contains, are, the stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidnies, urinary bladder, some of the organs of generation, • and certain appendages ; all these parts are enveloped ■wholly, or partially, by a serous membrane, called, the peritoneum, which also lines the walls of the abdomen. For the sake of pointing out the situations which the different oi'gans of the belly respectively occupy, Anatomists have divided, and subdivided its parietes into regions. If a Ihie be di*awn transversely, about two fingers' breadth above the umbilicus, we define the upper divi- sion, which is subdivided into three, by di*awing a line on each side, corresponding with the edges of the cartilages of the ribs. The middle of these subdivi- sions is named, the regio epigastrica vel scrobiculus cordis; in which space we find the greater portion of

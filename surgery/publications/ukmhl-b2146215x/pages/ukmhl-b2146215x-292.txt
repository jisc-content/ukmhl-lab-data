collection of the serum of this bag, gives rise to the disease called, hydrops pericardii: M. Skielderup, of Copenhagen, proposes, in cases of this kind, to remove by a trephine, a portion of the sternum, between the fifth and sixth ribs, and to let out the fluid by puncture. The student will find the heart lying obliquely to the left side in this bag; the base of it is placed back- wards, the apex forwards; and if the apex be accu- rately noticed, with regard to the part of the parietes to which it corresponds, it will be found that it is a little below the nipple of the left breast. Some of the ancients supposed that the heart lay perpendicularly iu the thorax; that is, in a line with the steraum; an error induced by their observations being confined to the Anatomy of brutes. The incision in the pericardium is tobe continued upwards, so as to make the great vessels at the basis of the heart conspicuous, and the student must ob- serve the situation of the right and left cavities of this organ, and the veins which terminate in, and the arteries which proceed fiom them. The left ventricle gives origin to the main trunk of the arterial system, which vessel, named, the aorta, ascends, forms a curvature, and then descends in the ,Â«ediastinum posterius; and in the chest, it^gives^ff the intercostal, oesophageal, and bronchial branches.

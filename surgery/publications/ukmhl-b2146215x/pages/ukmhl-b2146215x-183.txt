159 Each corpus cavernosum arises from tlic ramus pubis, ascends, and meets the opposite body; the two bodies then unite, and pass to the glans penis, to which tlieir exti'emities are applied. By their junc- tion a groove is left above, for the arteria dorsalis, and vena magna ipsius penis ; and below, is another furrow for the corpus spongiosum. Between the two corpora caveniosa there is a partition, called the septum penis, but it is perforated, so tliat the cells in one corpus freely communicate with those of the other. The corpus spongiosum begins at the bulb of the ui-ethra, and terminates in the expansion called glans. The prominent ring at the commencement of the glans is named the corona glandis, and the conti-acted part behind is the cervix. About the corona and cervix there ai-e many small follicles, which secrete a sebaceous matter to defend the glans, and to facilitate the motion of the iJi'epuce backwards and forwards. The three corpora of the penis are cellular in struc- ture, as inflation proves, but the cells of the corpus spongiosum are more delicate than those of the cor- pora cavernosa. The Organs of Re-production in the Fe- male are divided into external and internal. The external are, the mons Veneris, labia, pu-

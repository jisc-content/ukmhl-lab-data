291 prominent points about the outlet of this cavity, serve as guides. In cutting for the stone, we feel for the arch of the pubes, begin the incision juSt below it, and extend it downwards midway between the anus and tuberosity of the ischium; the arch of the pubes, and tuber ischii are fixed points, and easily felt under their soft covering, and in a general way the Surgeon cannot do wrong, if he governs his first incision by them. The bony pelvis has an articulatory surface above, ibr the last lumbar vertebra, and two hollows or sockets below, for receiving the heads of the thigh bones. There is an expansion formed by the ilia; ie&w that a conti'action called the brim; then a cavity; and lastly the outlet. In the adult, the pelvis is composed of four bones, viz.â€”the sacrum, os coccygis, and two ossa innominata. In the young subject, each OS innominatum consists of thi'ee distinct portions of bone, the iliac, ischiatic, and pubic; but by age the three portions become one. The connection of the bones of the pelvis to the spine, and to each other, is rendered firm by strong ligaments. The junction of the sacrum to the ilium on each side, is called the saci-o-iliac symphysis; that of the pubes on the fore part, the symphysis pubis. The bones are so firmly bound together, as to preclude almost the possibility of dislocation. A weight (as the wheel of a loaded carriage) might separate the junc-

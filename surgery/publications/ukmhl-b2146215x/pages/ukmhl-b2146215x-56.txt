32 that we should not limit our examination to separate, or individual parts, but extend it to the great whole in connexion; I repeat, however, that parts must he understood, before any other thing be attempted. The bones of the Cranium are eight in number, six of which are proper to the cranium, viz.—the os frontis, two ossa parietalia, two ossa temporalia, and the OS occipitis, and two common to the cranium and face, viz.—the os sphenoides, and os ethmoides. They are joined together by irregular lines, called sutui-es, variously named. That wliich connects the OS frontis to the ossa parietalia, is called the coronal suture.—The one which unites the ossa parietalia, the sagittal suture.—The sutures joining the os temporale on each side to the os parietale, os occipitis, os sphe- noides, and os maljE, are called tbe squamous or tem- poral; the additamentum sutiu-ee lambdoidalis; sphe- noid; and zygomatic—Those connecting the occipital bone to the parietal bones, temporal bone on either side, and sphenoid bone, are named, the lambdoidal, the additamentum suturae lambdoidal, and sphenoid sutures. The sphenoid bone is united to suiTounding bones by the sphenoid suture; and the ethmoid by the ethmoid sutiu-e. The bones of the Face are fourteen in number; twelve of them are in pairs, the remaining two aie single. The pairs are, the ossa malarum, ossa unguis, ossa nasi, ossa maxillaria superioia, the ossa spou-

2 tation the means which are employed by scientific Anatomists; but the folly of such an opinion is best exposed by the fatal mischief to which it is sure to lead. From the manner in which some men talk of Dissectors, and Dissections, it would really seem that the Anatomist experienced a gratification from his pursuits, beyond that wl^ch a conviction of their utility, as the basis of professional knowledge, affords. But let them follow him in his secret re- searches, and they will not fail to be convinced, that nothing but a sense of duty,—the cause of humanity, the wish to shun the immolation of his fellow- creatuies,—and the promotion of science,—could incline him to exchange pure atmosphere for the noxious elfluvia of a dissecting-room, and the tran- quil seciuity of other employments, for that occu- pation which is pregnant with danger from contagion and wounds. It is seldom that a winter passes over without some sacrifice of life to the perilous cause which we espouse. Can the zeal then of the Anato- mist be fafrly attributed to any other motive than the honourable ambition of adorning the profession of Medicine and Surgery, two sciences very closely allied to the best interests of society ? The question—whether Dissection is necessaiy or not?—is one which concerns the cause of humanity. If its utility be denied, and Dissection be abandoned upon this supposition, the Medical World will soon agj^in be plunged into that state of barbarity which

70 mg, hiccup, and laug-liiug, are sympathetic affections of these organs. In speaking of the circulation, we said, that the blood ijassed fi-om the venae cava; into the right auricle; from the light auricle into the right ventricle; and from thence to the lungs by the pulmonary arterj'. The ultimate branches of the pulmonary artery ramify on the parietes of the air cells; anastomose fi'eely with each other; and terminate in the radicles of the pul- monary veins. The pulmonary veins unite, and form at length four considerable trunks, which empty them- selves into the left amicle of the heart. Seeing, then, that the blood circulates through the lungs 'ere it goes from the venous to the arterial system, it is reasonable to inquire into the necessity for this. If we observe the blood in the right cavities of the heart, and compare it with that in the left, we shall find a great difference in the coloiu' and pro- perties of the two. That in the foioner is what we call venous blood, or blood that has circulated throughout the body, and lost, from that cu-cumstance, a part of its old properties, and acquii-ed new ones. It is of a very dark crimson colour, in consequence of having absorbed a quantity of cai'bon. That iu the latter is arterial blood, or blood deprived of its carbo- naceous qualities; hence, of a lighter, and more florid colour. Knowing that the change. takes place in the lungs, we must, of course, ascribe it to respiration,

180 This nerve is frequently aflfected with the painful disease called tic douloureux; but this affection may depend on a disease of one or more of the branches of the portio dura, or facial nerve. This nerve is seen within the cranium, in company with the portio mollis. It enters the bony cavity of the ear, through the foramen auditivum internum, and in the canal of Fallopius it receives the recurrent or superficial branch of the vidian. The ti-unk of the nerve leaves the ear through the foramen stylo-mastoi- deimi; and is seen on raismg the parotid gland. Soon after emerging from this hole, it divides into branches to the temple, face, tind throat; and the appearance thus produced, is named by anatomists, the pes anserinus. It is obvious, when we observe the distribution of this nerve, and that of the infra-orbitai-, that it is not easy to determine in which of the two sets of branches the morbid affection is seated. But the infra-orbitar branches are oftener foimd to be the seat of disease, than the facial. In a case of tic douloiu-eux of the fecial nerve, it would be difficult if not dangerous to attempt the division of its trunk, the only place indeed where it can be reached with safety, is at the anterior edge of the mastoid process of the temporal bone; but an incision down upon it, in this situation, would in some cases endanger a wound of the occipital artery.

294 some twites of nerves, which pass out under Poupart's ligament to supply the upper part of the thigh; they are principally cutaneous branches. The anterior ci-m-al nerve must be next exposed, and its course followed. The dissection of the obturator nerves, and others, must be deferred until the pelvic organs have been examined; they ought then to be looked for, as a knowledge of their origin, course, and disti-ibuticn, assists us in explaining the numbness, pain, and cramp, in the thighs and legs^ during the progress of parturition, and why, in the different stages of labour, the painful sensations are refeired to diiferent situations. In the male subject, the cavity of the pelvis is less capacious than in the female, as it contains fewer organs. Anteriorly is seen the nrinai-y bladder, which is attached to the pubes before, and situated in the pubic region. When empty, the fundus, or uppei; part of this organ, is nearly on a level with the upper edge of the ossa pubes; when distended, it rises in the pelvis; and at its utmost distension, it reaches nearly to the umbilicus. Behind the bladder is the rectum, which takes the curve of the hollow of the sacrum; and between the bladder and rectum, is a pouch, formed by peritoneum. The student knows, from the view which we have before given of this membrane, that after leaving the recti muscles, it passes over the fundus, and posterior surface of the bladder, to near Its cervix; it then ascends over the fore part of the

232 completely. Mr. Burns mentions a case, in which he? and others were induced to hint, that the arteria iuuo- miuata might he tied; but the boldness of the ope- ration, and the deficiency of data whereupon to esti- mate the ijrobabilily of its issue, forbade them to urge the proposition. We shall now enumerate the parts which are con- cerned in tying the common carotid arteiy; they are, the common integument; platysma myoides; fascia; stemo cleido mastoideus; omo' hyoideus; nervus de- scendens noni; sheath of the vessels; internal jugular vein; and par vagum. The nervus sympatheticus is situated without and behmd the sheath, therefore not at all endangered in the operation. An examination of the course and parts in con- nection with the arteiy, must fully convince us that the situation where it is most easily reached, is just above the decussation of the sterno cleido, and omo hypideus muscles; but the aneurismal tumour may be so low down, as to requii'e the ligatiu-e to be placed on the vessel below this spot; here the operation is more difficult, as the artery is deeper, and to expose it, the sternal head of the sterno cleido muscle must be raised. The right carotid arteiy is one of the branches into which the arteria innominata divides; the left carotid arises from the arch of the aorta, and at the

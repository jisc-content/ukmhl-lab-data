339 .. The muscles of adduction are, the Uiacus iuternus, psoas magnus, pectineus, gracilis, adductores, obtu- rator exteraus, and quacb-atus femoris. The muscles of rotation inwards are, the anterior portions of the glutseus medius, and glutaeus minimus, the tensor vaginae femoris, sartorius, and gracilis. The muscles of rotation outwards ai-e, the glutaeus maximus, glutiEUs medius, pyiiformis, gemini, obtu- rator externus, quadratus femoris, iliacus internus, psoas magnus, and three adductores. The knee is like the elbow, a gmgiymoid joint; when the leg is a little bent, however, a slight rotatory motion can be performed. The muscles of the anterior part of the thigh (the sartorius excepted) are, the ex- tensors. Those of the posterior part ai-e, the flexors. The rotators inwards are, the muscles which go to be inserted into the tibia. The rotator outwards is, the biceps, which is inserted into the fibula. The ankle-joint is hinge-like, but in addition to flexion and extension, it can be l)ent inwards and outwards. The flexors are, the tibialis anticus, and the extensor muscles of the toes. The extensors are, the gastrocnemii, plantaris, tibialis posticus, peronei, and flexors of the toes. The benders inwards are, the tibialis posticus, the extensor proprius poUicis, and the flexors of the toes.

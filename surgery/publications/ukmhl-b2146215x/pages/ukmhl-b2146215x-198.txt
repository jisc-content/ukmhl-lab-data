174 On observing the manner in which the hones of the cranium ai-e protected from external injury, by soft parts, we find that in the frontal part of the head, above the superciliary ridges, there is nothing more than common integument, the tendon of the occipito frontalis muscle, and the pericranium On the sum- mit of the head, and on the upper and lateral parts of it, the protection is similar. At the lower and lateral parts we find the temporal muscles covered with a dense fascia; posteriorly, above the upper transverse ridge of the os occipitis, the soft parts are the same as on the forehead; but below the occipital ridge, are the thick muscles of the neck. Bearing in mind the relative thickness, and sti-ength of the bones of the cranium, and the means of protection furnished by the soft parts, inferences should be drawn as to the compai-ative liability of the different bones to suffer fracture from external force. Of all the bones of the cranium, the parietal are most fi-equently broken, because they are larger, weaker, and less protected, the temporal excepted, which, at their squamous portion, are somewhat thinner. The os frontis is quite as much exposed to accident; but it is stronger, and thicker, than the parietal. The force to fracture either of the temporal bones, must be of a pointed or penetrating kind; for the massy temporal muscle shields it. A very little of the occipital bone appears above the fleshy muscles attached to the upper transverse ridge; hence,

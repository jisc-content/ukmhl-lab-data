280 The peritoneum consists of two perfect bags, and all the viscera of the abdomen and pelvis are situated behind them. It is no more possible to say, where this membrane begins, and where it ends, than it is to determine the points of commencement and termi- nation in a cii-cle; but we may, for the purpose of following its reflection, imagine such points. There is miich difficulty in conveying an accurate idea of the manner in which the peritoneum covers the different organs of the abdomen and pelvis. In a strictly lateral observation, only a few of its turnings can be shown; but a good notion of them can be given by an oblique deviation fi-om the front view. The" parietes of the abdominal and pelvic cavities ai-e to be imaguied as entii-e, but transparent, so as to admit the viscera to be seen behind them; in con- formity to this idea, the accompanying diagram has been executed; but it must not be considered as strictly correct with respect to relative position and size.

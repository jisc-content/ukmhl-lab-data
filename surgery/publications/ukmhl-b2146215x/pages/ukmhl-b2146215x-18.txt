IT which contributes to its duration ? The Elements tif Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology, ought then to be studied together. The Medical and Surgical Educai-'' tion, must be perfect, according to the intimacy of the union; and imperfect, in proportion to then-disunion. By their combination, interest will be excited; the memoi-y less burthened, as one idea will recall others ; and thus the acquisition of useful information will be rendered a pleasing amusement, instead of a labo- rious task. ^^â– ^ The only work in which an attempt has been made to unite the different branches of Medical Seii- ence into a general system, is that of Dr. Mason Good, in the execution of which, the author has dis- played the most i)rofound erudition; but it will ibe seen, on examming the " Study or Medicine," that its aiTangement is very different to mine; that it is not an Elementary Work; and that for a student to read it with advantage, he must first be well grounded in general principles; afterwards, CuUen's and Mason Good's volumes, Avhich in certain respects may be put in competition with each other, will be appreciated as they deserve, and considered as stan- dards of excellence in JMedical Literature.

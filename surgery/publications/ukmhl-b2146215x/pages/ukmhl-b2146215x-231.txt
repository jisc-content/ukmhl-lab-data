206- Tve are not to rcla-x our exeitions; but the indication of treatment is changed. An abscess in the throat is dangerous, as it may spontaneously burst, the matter escape into the ti-achea, and the patient be suffocated. Many fotal cases of this accident are recorded; the progress of suppuration, therefore, must be watched, rf and as soon as matter forms, it must be discharged by puncture.

In this country, I have been informed, that a Surgeon, in opening a tonsillitio abscess, actually did plunge the knife into the cai-otid; I scarcely need add, that he lost his patient before he could suppress the bleeding.

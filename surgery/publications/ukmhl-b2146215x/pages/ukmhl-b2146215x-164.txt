The external ear has scarcely any motion in the human subject; but in animals, it is extensively mobile. To the emuiences, and depressions, formed by the external cartilages, different names are given, as helix; antiheiix; ti-agus; antitragus; fossa innominata; scapha; and concha; by these, the sound is collected, and transmitted to the membrajia tympani, which is the septum between the external and internal parts of the auditoiy appa- ratus.

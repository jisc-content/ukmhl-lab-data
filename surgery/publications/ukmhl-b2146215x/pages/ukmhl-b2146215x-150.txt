126 The power which the eye has, of adapting itself to distances, is, by some Physiologists, ascribed to the recti muscles compressing the ball of the eye, and changing its conformation. To view objects placed at different distances, either the whole, or some part of this organ, must have the ability to undergo changes, in order to adj&st the focal point; for the rays of light which reach the eye ft-om a near, and those fi-om a distant object, could not converge at the retina, the seat of vision, without some alteration; either in the length of the axis; in the form of the cornea; in the position of the otlier refractmg media; or in the situation of the retina itself. If we suppose that the four sti-aight muscles can compress the scle- rotic coat sufficiently to alter the axis, or to push for- wards the humom-s, and thereby to increase in a mate- rial degree, the convexity of the cornea, we need not seek for other means of accounting for the adjustment of the eye to distances; but it is far from being certain that the muscles have this compressing effect, to the adequate extent, even in the human eye; and certainly not in such animals as have the tunica sclerotica of considerable thickness. The axis of the eye, or the form of the coniea, then, are not likely to be much altered by the action of the four recti muscles; but comparative Anatomy furnishes us with a fact, which proves that the cornea may be one of the instruments of adaptation; for Mr. Crampton informs us, in the " Annals of Philosophij;' that he has demonstrated the existence of a muscle in birds, capable of changing

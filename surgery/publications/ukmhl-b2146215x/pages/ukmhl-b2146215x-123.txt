99 By disease, it is often altered in its appearance; in bilious fevers, it is of a yellow colour; in inflam- matory disease, it is red, &c. Imiumerable, almost, are the appeai-ances which it assumes, under diflTerent circumstances; and, taken alone, the urine will often furnish the most satisfactory diagnosis of disease. The impediments to the discharge of urine from the bladder, are amongst the most formidable of all surgical diseases. They may reside in the bladder itself; in the prostate gland; or in the urethra. When the bladder loses its tone, from over distension, the catheter, and other means, will be necessary. When the prostate gland is enlarged, as it usually is in old age, there is often a mechanical obstruction to the flow of urine ; and the catheter is the only method of giving relief. When stiictm-e in the urethra is the cause of retention, we must aim at removing the stricture by bougies ; but for temporary purposes, we must introduce the catheter; and if this be not jjracticable, there ai-e two resources left; the one is, to make an opening into the urethi-a, behind the stricture; the other is, to pmictiu'e the bladder. Of late years, some of the most eminent Chemists have turned their attention to the examination of uri- nary calculi. Dr. Woolaston, Mr. Brande, Dr. Mar- cet. Dr. Hem-y, and Professor Vauquelm, have done much for this department of science. The materials usually met with in these concretions, are, luic acid;

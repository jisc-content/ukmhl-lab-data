324 resources of nature Lave been found adequate to the supply of a sufficient quantity of blood for the support of the limb. A wound of the axillai-y artery is regarded as an accident which requii-es a ligature on the subcla- vian; but no secui-ity against hoemoiThagc^can be fully calculated upon, unless the wounded vessel is cut down upon, and two ligatiires passed; one above, and the other below the bleeding point. This remaik will lead me to speak of the relations of the axillar}' artery, and the parts concerned in the operation of tying it. To gain a view of the axillary vessels, and nerves just below the clavicle, an incision is to be made in a line corresponding with the lower mai-gin of that bone, and another to meet it along the edge of the deltoid muscle; the integument is then to be reflected towards the sternum, in order to bring into view, the clavicular portions of the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles. The origin of the latter muscle from the clavicle is next to be raised, and the cellular meiiir brane underneath to be dissected carefully away. The parts seen after a little dissection are, the cephalic vein terminating in the axillary vein; the humeral thoracic artery winding up to the deltoid muscle; the axillary vein partly covered by the pectoralis minor muscle; the axillary artery partly concealed by thp vein; and behind the artery is the axillary plexus of nei*ves; but in order to expose these parts in the greatest possible degree, the pectoralis nuyor should be relaxed.

30 composition, and that to the due and healthy office of bone, they must exist in certain proportions; and knowing that there are vessels which can diminish or increase the one or the other, in quantity; we cannot be astonished at the occurrence of preternatural hard- ness or softness. Thus, the diseases of bone may be attributed to the states of the vascular system, as those of the softer textures of the body. An increased action of the blood-vessels will constitute inflammation. An increased secretion will cause the effusion of a fluid, which, in time, will be converted into bone, causing exostosis. A change in the action of the vessels, by which they secrete pus, will give rise to suppuration. An increased action of the absorbents, with the preceding condition of the blood-vessels, wiU occasion ulceration. The extinction of the vital principles, mortification. And a loss of balance between the secreting and absorbing systems, rachitis, mollities ossiuMy and fragilitas ossium, so far as we are acquainted with the true natui-e of these diseases. Considering the subject in this way, the general Pathology of the osseous system is simplified, foimd much to resemble that of soft parts, and to differ only in the slowness of the morbid action, and in the tardy progress of the restorative power; ,cii-cumstances arising from the quantity of inorganic matter, which peculiarly characterizes the structure pf bone. Bones may be divided into four classes, viz.— the flat, or those of the head;—the cylindical, or those

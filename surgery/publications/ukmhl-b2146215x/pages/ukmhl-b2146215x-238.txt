212 are suspended in the cases now under consideration; we are therefore to imitate them by artificial means. Having- distended the lungs in the way described, we imitate inspiration; we imitate expiration by com- pressing the chest, and allowing the nostrils and mouth to re-open. The distension and expulsion are thus alternated, until all hope is extinct, or resuscita- tion crowns our elforts with success. When the patient is in the passive state attendant on suspended animation, the above methods of inilating the lungs are adequate substitutes for laryngotomy, or trache- otomy; but when a foreign body is lodged in the larynx, or windpipe, an opening must be made for its extraction, or dischai-ge. A knowledge of the relative position of pai'ts shows the possibility of passing a probe, with a proper cui-vature, through the nosti-il into the Eus- tachian tube to clear it from obstructions; and it explains how an enlargement of the tonsil gland may so close the orifice of the tube, as to exclude air from the cavity of the tympanum, and thereby produce a partial or complete deafness.

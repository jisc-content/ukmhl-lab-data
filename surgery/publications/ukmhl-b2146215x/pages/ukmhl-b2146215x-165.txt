HI mcmbrauc is ovaj iu figure, and objique in it§ direp- tiqn, in order to preveflt tjie reflection of sound. By some Auatomists, it is sm>p.osed to be muscular; Sir Everai-d Home is of this opinion, and tbinks tbat the fibres run from the cii-cumference tp th,e centi'e, wherp they are attached to the malleus, or ^rst pf the cl^ain of bones, and that tlie use of this structure is to ens^ble the membrane to vary its degree of tension, to receive quickly the vibrations conveyed Jo it by the sonorous rays, and thereby to give us more accurate perceptions of sound. Sii- Everard jnay be rigbt, bi^t there i§ another circumstance \yhich can vary the degr,e£ gf pension of the membra^a tympani sufficiently for these purposes, viz.—the small muscles \ytdch *ct on tbe bones in the cavity of the tympanum; and as tbe first of tliese (the malleus) is aUached to the mepibrane of the drum, and the last (the stripes) to the membrane of the foramen ovale; the movement of the bones mu§t influence the state of both these membranes. Analogy is in favoiu- of Sii- Everard Home's opi- nion, as muscular fibres exist in the elephant, and some other animals; but Physiology does not seem peremptorily to require them in the human car. The membrana tympani, we have said, separates the external from the internal parts of the ear, and naturally the separation is complete. Cheseldon says^ however, that the membrane does not entirely close the passage; but has, on one sid<^, a small apertui-e.

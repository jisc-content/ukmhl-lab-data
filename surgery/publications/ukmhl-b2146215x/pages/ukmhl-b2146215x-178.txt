154 mine it; but they found so many obstacles to the enquiry, as to be prevented from coming to any positive conclusion. It is, however, the source of the perspirable fluid, which is secreted by the cutaneous vessels. In addition to these functions, the skin is an extensive sympathizing organ, and often influences the state of the lungs, stomach, intestines, and kidnies. When the cutaneous secretion is checked by cold; the lungs, alimentary canal, and minaiy organs, fre- quently become disordered. Catarrh, and pneimionia, often arise from this cause. The bowel-complaint of the Spring and Autumn, are generally to be traced to suppressed perspiration, fi-om the frequent vicissitudes of the weather at these seasons of the year; and every bbdy knows how sparingly the urine is secreted when we perspii-e .freely, and vice versa. I am convinced, from observation, that the enteric aftections of the Spring and Autumn, are of an inflammatory chai-acter, and almost in every instance produced by the sudden application of cold to the skin. The effect of this is, to impel the blood from the surface; and from the in- timate sympathy between the chylo-poietic viscera and skin, it is not sui-prizing, that the former should be move liable to suffer, than other organs. In these complaints, when the inflammatory action is in a moderate degree, the alvine evacuations are mucous, and profuse; but when the inflammation runs high, the secretion is diminished, and costive- ncss prevails. That tlie suppression of the secretory

367 (To tie the anterior tibial artery, just after it has perforated tlie interosseous ligament of the leg, we must disseet through the skin, and fascia, between the tibialis anticus, and the extensor communis muscles. The artery lies on the lig-ament, in company with the vensE comites and nerve. About a hand's breadth from the ankle, it is situated between the tibialis anticus, and the extensor longus pollicis; and on the anterior part of the foot, between the first tendon of the extensor communis, and the tendon of the extensor longus pol- licis. At the space, between the tarsal extremities of the meta-tarsal bone of the great toe, and toe next it, the artery dips into the sole of the foot. ^jl^ .,The posterior tibial artei7 lies deep, but may be reached at any part of its course. Behind the inner 9^nkle, too, the vessel may be tied: in this situation, the artery bears the same relations to the venae comites,> ajVid nerve, as it does higher up. m odT .ynrndai-nu 3,,,,The peroneal artery, below the middle of the leg, is situated at the posterior surface of the fibula. , ,i . When we trace the arteries of the leg and foot, we find fi-ee communications of the muscular branches of the trunks. At the ankles, the anterior tibial sends qff the rami malleolares externus et intemus, which anastomose with branches sent oiF about the joint by thCj posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries. The ante- rior tibial is then continued forwards under the annular

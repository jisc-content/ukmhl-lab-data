46 circulation. At the extremity of the fang, or fangs of a tooth, a small hole may be perceived, which leads to a cavity, in which is lodged the pulp, consisting of a gela- tinous substance, which supports the vessels and nei-ves of the tooth. The teeth are confined in their alveoli, or sockets, by means of their periosteum, and the gums. The Salivary Glands are the parotid, sub- maxillary, and sublingual; their ducts terminate in the mouth, where their secretion mixes with the food, to facilitate mastication and deglutition. The (Esophagus is the tube wliich conveys the masticated food into the stomach. It begins at the pharynx, and ends at the cardiac orifice of the stomach; and is a muscular canal, lined by a mucous membrane. Soon after the food has entered the stomach, it loses the character of a masticated sub- stance, and assumes that of an uniform mass. The portion nearest the pylorus is most altered in appear- ance ; for it has taken on the character of chyme: the change having been produced by the gasti-ic juice, which is a powerful solvent. The Stomach is a muscular, and membranous bag; not inaptly compared in its figm-e, to a bag-pipe. It has two orifices, two extremities, two curvatm-es, and two siu-faces. Its coats ai'e tln-ee, viz.â€”a perito- neal, muscular, and villous; the gastric juice is secreted by the vessels of the villous coat.

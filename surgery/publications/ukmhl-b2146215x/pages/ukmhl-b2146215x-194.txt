170 The bony parts of the nostrils are next to be observed, and the terminations of the frontal, sphce- noidal, and aethmoidal cells, the ductus ad nasum, and the opening of the anti-um reighmorianum. The bones of the mouth, &c. come next; the teeth must be studied ; the molar teeth, which communicate with the floor of the antrum looked for; as all these are prac- tical jjoints. In the side view, we oljserve a part of the os frontis; the lateral part of the os parietale; the os temporale; the zygomatic arch ; the styloid process; the entrance to the organ of hearing; the mastoid process ; and a part of the os occipitis. The situation of the anterior inferior angle of the temporal bone should be marked in its relative position to the tem- poral root of the zygoma, which is prominent, and can be felt through the soft parts which cover it; because the angle shows the seat of the dm*a mati'al artery. The posterior inferior angle must also be noticed, because it corresponds to the comer of the lateral sinus. In this view, in most crania, some irre- gular portions of bone are seen between the parietal, temporal, and occipital bones; they are called, ossa triquetra, and have been mistaken for depressed frag- ments; the student, therefore, should be aware of their situation, in order to avoid such a dangerous error. The posterior view is chiefly occupied by the os occipitis, of which the ridges and tuber are remarkable

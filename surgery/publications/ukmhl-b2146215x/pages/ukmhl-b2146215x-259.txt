'133 lower part of the neck this vessel lies close to the oesophagus It is no longer problematical whether the carotid artery can be safely tied; that injurious effects on the functions of the brain would supervene, was an appre- hension wliich the result of very many cases has fully proved to be totally unfounded. Putting a ligature about the carotid is almost an eveiy day operation, in large hospitals. The Anatomy of the blood-vessels shows, that the arteries which furnish blood to one side of the neck, face, scalp, and brain, freely anas- tomose with those of the other; hence one of the caro- tid ai-terics may be obliterated without danger. If both carotids were secured, the only resources left, are, the vertebral, inferior thyroideal, and superficial, and deep cervical arteries, which are branches of the subclavian, and not adequate I think, to furnish the' necessaiy supply of blood. In passing the ligature, care must be taken that neither the par vagum, nor jugular vein, is included in the ligature, for to tie either would be fatal. This is to be received as certain, with regard to the nerve, and nearly equally so with respect to the vein; for the dangerous effects of a ligature on a vein, has caused the operation of tying the vena saphena for varix of the lower extremity, to be abandoned as unsafe. The head being still more bent back than it has been for the dissection of the carotid, and its connections in the 2 G

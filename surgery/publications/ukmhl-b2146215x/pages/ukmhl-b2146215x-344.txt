314 The shoulder-joint has a veiy extensive degree of motion, from the scapula affording a veiy superficial lodgement for the head of the os humeri. We can caiTy the arm forwards, which is called extension; backwards, flexion; from the trunk, abduction; towards the trunk, adduction; and the os humeri may be made to revolve, which is called rotation. When we carry the arm forwai-ds, the pectoralis major, the anterior portion of the deltoides, the coraco brachidis, the subscapulaiis, and the biceps, are called into action. When in an opposite direction, the posterior fibres of the deltoides, the latissimus dorsi, teres major, teres minor, and triceps, act. Abduction is performed by the deltoides, and the supra and mfi-a spinati muscles. Adduction, by the pectoralis major, and latissimus dorsi. Rotation inwards, by the sub- scapularis, anterior fibres of the deltoid muscle, latis- simus dorsi, and teres major; and rotation outwards, by the posterior fibres of the deltoid muscle, the mfra spinatus, and teres minor. The elbow-joint is hinge-like, and capable only of flexion and extension. The flexors are, the biceps, and brachialis interims. The extensors are, the triceps, and anconeus. But the radius moves upon the ulna, producing the motions called pronation and supination. The pronators are, the pronator teres, pronator quadi-atus, and flexor carpi radiahs The supinators are, the biceps, supinator radii longus, supinator radii brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pol- licis, and extensor primi et ^cundi internodii poflicis.

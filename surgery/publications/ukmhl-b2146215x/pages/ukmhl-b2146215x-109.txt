85 vessel, natiu-e sets up a process, by which the flow of blood is soon suppressed; this process consists in the formation of a coagulum, which fills up the open- ing, and acts mechanically, on the principle of a plug; lymph, in a little time, is effiised, the wound closed, and the coagulum is absorbed. If an arteiy of the size of the temporal should he partially cut, nature might not be able to stop the bleeding; but if divided completely across, she AviU be likely to succeed without any assistance: for, when completely cut, the extremities of the vessel reti-act within the cellular membrane, which entangles the eflfiised blood, and thus lays the foundation of a coagulum, which, as in the former case, temporarily shut the bleeding vessel. Although, now and then, nature alone can suppress a haemor- rhage, the aid of surgical means is often called for, pai-ticularly if it be of an ai-terial land. The common principles in the ti-eatment of haemoiThages, whether internal, or external, is to diminish the force of circulation, by rest, cold, and the produc- tion of sjTicope; but in external haemorrhages, we may employ other means; such as astringents, styptics, escharotics, sponge, compression, and the ligature. How these means act, is sufficiently evident, and I shall only observe, Avith respect to the ligature, that its immediate effect, (as proved by Dr. Jones' experi- ments), is the division of the internal, and muscular coats of the artery, and the approximation of the

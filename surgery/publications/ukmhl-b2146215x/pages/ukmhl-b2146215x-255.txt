229 tumoiir, a circurastance indicated by pain on pressure, it -would be rash and dangerous to employ it. The cure, in this way, must at all times he an exceedingly tardy and wearisome process; hut it is justifiable in certain cases to tiy its effect. When acting in a pro- per manner, it gives no pain, and cui-es by diverting the current of the circulation from the aneurismal sac. Prior to the year 1785, (a period which should be kept in remembrance from having given birth to a most important improvement in operative surgeiy) the operation for aneurism was pregnant vfith difficulty and danger, so that Mr. Pott and others declared, that imtil a better mode of treathig the disease was discov- ered, amputation was the only resource in popliteal aneurism. The operation consisted in cutting open the tumour, cleaning it of its contents, and tying the artery at each extremity of the sac. We are told that this method was first adopted by Severinus and Tml- lus, about the year 1646, in a case of aneurism in the thigh ; and subsequently to them by many surgeons in France, Germany, and Italy. The first operation of the kind performed in this country, at least the first on record, occurred to Mr. Bm-chall, at the Manches- ter Infirmary, in 1757; an account of which, will be found in the third volume of " Medical Observations' and Inquiries." The fi-equent failure caused it to fall into disuse, and amputation of the limb was sub- stituted, until Jolui liimter's improvement superseded the necessity of so desperate an expedient.

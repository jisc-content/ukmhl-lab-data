180 pitis; because, just above the nose are the frontal sinuses, and the continued line indicates the course of the longitudinal sinus of the brain. 2d.—At the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, situated about two inches above the zygomatic arch; because the artery of the dura mater is here embedded in a deep sulcus in the bone, and a wound of it might occasion a serious hoemorrhage. 3d.—At the posterior inferior angle of the parie- tal bone, which is situated just above the root of the mastoid process of the temporal bone; because it is in the course of the lateral sinus. The accompanying sketch is intended to show the manner in which the dura mater envelopes the contents of the cranium ; and the relations of the sinuses of the brain to the exterior of the skull. The dura mater gives a. complete lining to the inner surface of the cranium, and. forms the processes represented by A, which is the falx, or septum cerebri. B—The left side of the tentorium; or that process wliich separates the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, from the upper surface of the cerebellum, and leaves aji aperture of communication, C. D represents the commencement of the superior longitudinal sinus, which, running along the summit of the brain, terminates by bifui-cating into the two lateral sinuses, of which the left is marked E • the right being concealed by the falx. F represents the inferior longitudinal sinus. G-The torcula llero- phili. H—The petrous sinus. 1—The cavernous sinus.

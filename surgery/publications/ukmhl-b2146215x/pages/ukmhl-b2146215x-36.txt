With the laws of Life, we are as well acquainted, as with the laws of Gra- vity; but we ai-e totally ignorant of the principle oi either, and most probably ever shall remain so. We will now trace some of the phenomena of Human Life. Before the stimulus of impregnation is given, Life may be said to be in a latent state; but when given, an excitation is created in the ovum, and the changes necessary to the formation of a new being, proceed in a gradual and regular manner, unless inter- rupted by preternatural circumstances; then Life is arrested in its course; the developing mass dies, and must be cast off from the nidus which lodged it, as peniicious and useless. The impregnated ovum is the primordium of the new Animal, roused to the action of developement; it is contained within two mem- branes, named chorion and amnion; and in this con- dition of parts, the ovum escapes from the ovarium, and is conveyed by the fallopian tube into the cavity of the uterus. But it is not only in one, or other of the appendages of the uterus, that a new action is set uj); the uterus itself midergoes changes, by which a preparation is made for the reception of.the ovum; this preparation consists in the formation of the tunica decidua uteri and the tunica decidua reflexa, the uses of which are,â€”1st.

— 7 — of the veins, by producing an adhesive phlebitis, prevent purulent infection. We can add that for the same reason alcoholic preparations pre- vent the formation of pus in the veins and lymphatics near the wound, in one word, prevent phlebitis, angeioleucitis, diffuse and _ suppurative. EXPERIMENTS. W e have inflicted simple wounds with a sharp instrument in the limbs and trunks of animals; which penetrated to the bone, and wounded the periosteum. After we had carefully washed the lips of the wound With alcohol.or some alcoholic compound, we united the deep parts by the quill suture, and the superficial ones by the interrupted suture. We have occasionally obtained union by the first intention. We have not lost one single case. We have sometimes removed the superficial suture, half an hour after it has been applied; we have then always observed, between the lips of the wound a gluey adhesive matter, the plastic lymph. There were no traces of hemor- rhage from the small vessels, a condition absolutely necessary for a perfect coaptation of the parts and consequently for union by the fu st intention. We have also applied the same treatment to amputations and desarticulations, we have generally obtained union by the first intention, diffuse suppuration has never occurred. Under the same treatment, contused wounds have rapidly healed with little or no suppuration. Compound comminuted complicated fractures healed rapidly, with little or no suppuration. Sometimes there was no pus, but a liquid half purulent half plastic; there were never any traces of suppuration, either in the cellular tissue or in the sheaths of the tendons. Compound fractures of the anterior limbs treated by suture and alcohol have healed rapidly and without suppuration. We have effected wounds with fire arms, we have alwnys

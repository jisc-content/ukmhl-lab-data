- 21 - the arteries and the effused blood prevent this coaptation and so hinder union by the first intention. We ought therefore to tie the larger vessels only and those with small ligatures and give a twist to the smaller ones with a forceps. The alcohol will stop the hemorrhage from the minute vessels. A firm compression by means of a pair of forceps and a cushion should then be made. Thus we shall obtain a perfect coaptation of the parts and consequently union by the 1st intention. Why should we not obtain the same results in large wounds which we do in small ones? It is a purely mechanical affair, one of exact coapta- tion of the parts, and nothing else. To prevent purulent infection, the alcohol must be applied to the orifices of the cut veins at the surface of the bone and be held there for some time by means of a roll of lint soaked in alcohol in the same way as the ancients used to do (J. L. Petit, etc.). The alcohol must, at weakest, be 36°. Brandy is evidently too weak for these cases. The final coaptation of the parts and the final dressing should, not arranged till some time after the first applica- tion of the alcohol. PARIS. — TTPOGRAPHIE DE HENRI Pl.ON, RUE GARANCIERE , 8

— 19 — day of his illness; there was no more fever : I advised him to con- tinue the use of the same medicament. Three months after, on my return to France, I saw this same ostler, fat and hearty, cured long ago. I should never have recognised him as the same man, had it not been for the cicatrice. It was solid, well united together a little sunk and adherent to the masseter. » In what cases and at what stages ought each particular prescrip- tion to be employed? This is the art which Ave have before said has to be studied and regained. In our experiments, we employed the same treatment for gun shot wounds as the ancients did, viz to enlarge the wound. We have been asked for some further information on this point. In wounds from balls, one should always like the ancients (whether there be fracture or not) make an immediate opening, and, as a preventive means, that opening should be large. In this way the extraction of balls or splinters is facilitated, a more favou- rable form in given to deep and anfractuous wounds, the applica- tion of topical remedies is facilitated, strangulation in prevented. 11* alcoholic dressings are employed, no inconvenience will result. They prevent purulent infection and diffuse suppuration by forming a false membrane round the wound. The ancients invariably prac- tised enlargement of the wound whereas the modern authorities are divided on that point. Much more if resection of the osseous extremities is practised (as M. Marmy has proposed and practised with success in fractures of the arm from balls) ought one to dress the wound with brandy. Resection requires large incisions. 03

- 12 â€” the attention of surgeons? It "was at the beginning of this century at a period when for fear of irritation the prescriptions of the old surgeons especially those containing alcohol were abandoned. Then, all of a sudden, a multitude of writings on purulent infection, which alone would fill a library, appeared. But this fatal complication of wounds and operations, is it a dis- covery of which modern medicine ought to be proud?

We need not state our opinion; in our minds there is no doubt.

We trust both for the sake of the progress of our profession and the interest of humanity that this question will be settled in accor- dance with our hopes and expectations. In this memoir we have confined ourselves to the consideration of alcohol and the alcoholic compounds, we do not by this mean to say that there were no other agents recognised by the old surgeons. On the contrary, in their prescriptions, especially for old wounds one sees in combination with alcohol a vast number of other sub- stances : resins, essential oils, pitch, incense, aloes, sal ammoniac, alun, blue vitriol, green vitriol. There is an art to study and recover. Indubitably alcohol and alcoholic compounds are the active agents in the prescriptions of the old surgeons for recent wounds and operations, and from the facility with which it can be obtained, its action on albumen, its influence on the plastic secretion and

ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLIC PREPARATIONS IN SURGERY. «-§><§-<> : A juvantibus et Indentions sit imlicatio. Amidst all the numerous recipes, #which have come down to us from the old surgeons, for wounds, we have observed that the greater part contained either alcohol or alcoholic preparations. This has led us to consider whether the alcohol might not he the active agent in these recipes, and whether it might not be ren- dered useful in surgery. We have examined the subject by the threefold light of theory, experiment, and history; the following are the results we have arrived at : TI1EOBET1CAL CONSIDERATIONS. Alcohol coagulates albumen in whatever liquid it may be, and consequently in blood, the synovia of synovial membranes, of ar- ticulations, the serosity which bathes the meshes of cellular tissue, and that which moistens the surfaces of serous visceral cavities.

It coagulates the albumen on the surface of wounds, forming it

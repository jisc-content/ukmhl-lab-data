— 14 — To Mr le Dr. Batailhi, professeur particulier d'anatomie, secretaire particulier de la SocUU midicale du Panthdon. Monsieur et tres-honore Confrere, In the first place I must thank you for your pamphlet, which you have had the kindness to send me. I have read it with all the attention and interest which it deserves, an interest which is in- creased by the community of ideas, which J find exists between myself and you and your honorable colleague. For four years I have been collecting facts on the same subject , Avith the intention of publishing them some day or other, but T hesi- tate to do so now that I find that, without our knowing one another or either of us being awrare of the identity of our experiments or of their results; you have bravely grappled with the subject and taken the initiative in propagating a therapeutical means, which has been far too much neglected lately.—Were I now to carry out my former intention, one of two things would happen. Either I should come too late and might incur the charge of plagiarism or I should ap- pear to claim a priority to which, I confess, I do not attach any great importance and to "which in point of fact your publication undoubtedly entitles you. — I much prefer therefore communicat- ing to you some of the principal facts which I am able to dispose of, leaving to your loyalty a free and entire latitude to use them as you may judge best for the interest of the subject, which I con- sider to be one of great practical importance. About five years ago a woman, a cook presented herself at my consultation suffering from an accident of a grave nature on the middle finger of her right hand. Five to six weeks before, whilst cleaning a fish, she prfeked herself w ith one of the. bones of the fin, a whitlow was the result. Owing to its having been treated in a most irrational manner by the old women to whom she applied in the first instance, it was then in a very aggravated condition.

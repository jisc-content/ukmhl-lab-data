_ 4 â€” iuto a greyish-white-pellicule. It stops the hemorrhage of the small vessels. It hastens the secretion of plastic lymph on the surface of the wounds. By separating the lips of the wound soon after the application of the alcohol we can watch the lymph in the very act of gluing them together; that is to say the same thing is taking place there which takes place on the surface of serous mem- branes. From these facts and^these principles it results that alcohol exer- cises a great influence on union by the first intention, that it pre- vents diffuse erysipelatous inflammation, purulent infusion of sy- novial membranes, and purulent infection. Let us explain ourselves : Alcohol favours union by the first intention, by stopping hemor- rhage of the smaller vessels (since the blood is a great obstacle to a perfect coaptation of the parts) by immediately producing a coagulum on the surface of wounds, and by accelerating the plastic secretion. It prevents diffuse suppuration by coagulating the albumen of the cellular tissue, which immediately becomes thick and is ren- dered impermeable to the unhealthy liquids which bathe their surfaces. Alcohol prevents the purulent effusions of synovial membranes by the immediate coagulation of the synovia, by causing the op- posite surfaces to adhere, by rendering them impermeable to the liquids which moisten the surfaces of fresh wounds, and by encou- raging an adhesive inflammation of the synovial membranes near the wound. Alcohol prevents purulent infection, by coagulating the blood in the open and even gaping veins, on the surfaces of wounds, thus instantly plugging them and favouring an adhesive inflam- mation. The theory of purulent infection has been much discussed. There arc three different opinions in vogue at this moment. 1st. That which regards purulent infection in the light of an es sential fever, a purulent fever (Tessier). 2ndly. The more gene- rally received one, to a certain exteut the classical one that which

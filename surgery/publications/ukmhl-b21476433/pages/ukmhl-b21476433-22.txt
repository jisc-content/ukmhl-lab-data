NOTE Since the publication of the 3rd edition of this memoir, some further clinical experiments have been made. At the hospital of St-Louis, Mr Dolbeau applied dressings of eau-de-vie camp/ire'e. After fifteen important operations (amongst which were one of the thigh, one of the arm and one of the breast), he experienced no sort of ill result. The innocence therefore of alcohol, as a therapeutical means, has, by these recent experiments combined with the practice of the ancients, been amply demon- strated, and, who will, may now make use of it without any fear of harm to the patient. Facts, too, confirmative of its influence in producing union by the first intention have been imparted to us. Mr le Dr Ad. Guillet obtained union by the first intention after an operation to remove a ganglionic tumour from the lower jaw. Mr le Dr Lacane, surgeon of the hospital of Calvi (Corsica) made use of alcohol in the case of a regimental cook. The articulation between the 1st and 2nd phalanx had been penetrated by a large knife. A flap of skin on the palmar surface was all that remained. The lips of the wound were washed with alcohol (strength, 36Â°) and a perfect coaptation of the parts was effected. Charpie soaked in alcohol was applied on it; and, at the end of 2 1 hours, union by the first intention was perfect. There was no suppuration. Mr Batailhe, after laying these facts before the medical society of the Pantheon made some remarks on the mode of obtaining union by the first intention; the following is an analysis. In the larger operations, as those of the arm, one often fails to obtain union by the first intention, because a perfect coaptation of the. parts is not effected.

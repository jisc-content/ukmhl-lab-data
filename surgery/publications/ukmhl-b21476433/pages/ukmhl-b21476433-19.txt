-li- the lumbar region, which had been left to itself without any inci- sions or opening. 5thly. To several furuncles and carbuncles of moderate dimen- sions and ordinary gravity. 6thly. In several fungous degenerations of the great toe from onyxis, which in some instances had been operated on, in others not. 7thly. In a vast ulcerating wound of the leg, the result of the laceration of the solt parts by the bursting of a bomb before Sebas- topol. 8thly. To produce a healthy modification of indolent chancres on the penis or vagina or in severe venereal buboes with conside- rable loss of skin. 9thly. Lastly in a quantity of small wounds or traumatic lesions, or ulcers of no great importance in different parts of the body. In all these cases which have been thus briefly enumerated. I have exclusively made use of the topic which I mentioned before, the comp. linct. of aloes. But to confess the whole truth I must add that I have never had the hardihood to apply this treatment in the first instance to severe wounds whether resulting from accident or operations. I have often thought of doing so, and wished to do so, but I have not dared, I feared, unnecessarily perhaps, the developement of severe inflam- mation. I have generally had recourse to in the first instance to the topical application of astringents or irrigation. I have only used alcohol in the second or third dressing to modify accidents which had already occurred, not to prevent them. Such then, honore" confrere, are the facts which the perusal of your interesting memoir has led me to lay before you. I trust that they may prove of some use in a future edition.

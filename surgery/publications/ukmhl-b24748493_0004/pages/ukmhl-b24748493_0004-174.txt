164 REPORT ON PEACTICAL MEDICINE. He gives his reasons for looking upon the cyst as a serous and not an hydatid one. The girl got well. Cleghorn ('Indian Med. Gaz.,' March, 1871, quoted in 'Lancet,' 1871, i, 624) believes that a considerable number of the hepatic abcesses that occur in India are due to suppurative changes taking place in old hydatid cysts.

Med.,' 1872, 45) describes a kind of epidemic of jaundice v?hich occurred in Paris and its immediate neigh- bourhood in the autumn of 1870. He himself had occasion to observe 28 cases, thus attacked, 17 males, and 11 females. The symptoms do not seem to have differed much from ordinary cases of jaundice. The ordinary period of the affection vpas about ten or eleven days. McPherson (' Am. Journ. Med. Sci.,' Ixi, 409) records the case, with autopsy, of a female, set. 59, who suffered from biliary calculus, and in whom a fistulous passage extended fi-om the cystic duct to the umbilicus, through which bile was discharged from time to time. Murchison ('Path. Soc. Trans.,' xxii, 152) gives the particulars of a very interesting case of biliary fistula in the abdominal wall of a female, set. 40, from which bile was discharged. The patient was alive at the time the notes were made. Pugliese, " De I'Hydrate du Chloral dans las Coliques hepatiques," 'Lyon Med.,' viii, 438.

The Oplithalmoscnpe in Diseases of the Nervous System. Boucliut (' Gaz. des Hop.,' 1871, 97) gives the following as seen in cases of acute affection of the brain and spinal cord. Optic hypersetnia and venous stases in the retina, coinciding with congestion of the meninges or thrombosis of the sinuses. Optic neuritis, with or without exudation, the result of meningo- encephalitis. Papillary oedema diagnostic of cerebral compression. Tubercles of the choroid always accompanied by tubercles of the meninges or the viscera. He gives three cases with autopsies : I. Girl, aet. 2; tubercular meningitis and general tuberculosis; during life almost entire disappearance of the optic papilla, which pre- sented a uniform red colouration masking its outline ; dilatation of the retinal veins ; no choroidal tubercle. a. Girl, set. 8; double optic neuritis and miliary tubercles of the choroid ; general tuberculosis, 3. Girl, set. 3 : atrophy of both optic nerves, as seen with the oph- thalmoscope; a tubercle (scrofulous tumour,—Eep.) of the cerebellum, the size of a hen's egg, and two the size of nuts, at the surface of the right cerebral hemisphere ; enormous quantity of fluid in the lateral ventricles ; no miliary tubercles anywhere. Socin (" Beitrag zur Lehre von den Sehstorungen bei Meningitis;" ' Deut. Arch.,' viii, 476) records two cases, in a man, set. 31, and a female, aet. 37, in whom, suffering with meningeal symptoms, the same sort of appearances in the optic disc were observed as in children with tubercular meningitis. Broadbent (' Path. Soc. Trans.,' xxiii, 216) records a case of dropsy of the sheath of the optic nerve in meningitis. The patient, a girl, £Bt. 19, had complained of headache for a fortnight. She had vomited, lay in a state of torpor with her eyes half closed, the pupils large and sliiggish, the right rather larger than the left. She had well-marked taches cerebrales. Tbe optic discs were well defined, of a dusky pink

bVAltlOTOMY. m be a piece o£ bone three quarters of an inch square. No piles were found. A probe passed through the opening entered the rectum a short distance above the sphincter, and a considerable cavity remained where the bone had rested. The following day two other smaU pieces of bone were removed. The fistula was subsequently slit up. The patient declared that he felt more comfortable than he had done for twenty years. He regained his former activity. The jjieces of bone were examined and were possibly portions of the scapula of a rabbit. The patient thought it had been "in him all those years," if so, it must have lodged in some part of the intestine, ulcerated its way out and gradually reached the pelvic opening. There was no history of any injury to the spine or sacrum. (' Lancet,' Aug. 26, 1871, 289.) Ovariotomy.—Mr. Alcock operated on a child three years old. The tumour was universally adherent. The patient died at the end of forty-eight hours. ('Lancet,' Dec. 16, 1871, 850.) Dr. W. Barker has operated on a child aged six years and eight months. The case was one of dermoid cyst of the right ovary. The patient recovered. (' Philadel. Med. Times,' Nov. i, 1871, and 'Am. Joiirn. Med. Sci.,' Jan. 1872, 285.) A case of ovarian disease on which Dr. Newman operated, using antiseptic ligatures and dressing, is narrated in the ' Med. Times and Gaz.,' Feb. 17, 1872, 184. Hfemorrhage occurred into the peritoneal cavity and the wound was opened (under carbolic spray) on the tenth day. About three ounces of " dark coloured and slightly offensive blood" was let out. The patient recovered. Dr. Newman regretted he had not used a clamp instead of the catgut ligature. jMr. Spencer "Wells publishes further tables of hospital cases in the 'Med. Times and Gazette,' Peb. 18 and March 25, 1871, 187 and 337. A fourth series of 100 cases of ovariotomy are recorded by Mr. Wells in the ' Med.-Chir. Trans.,' liv, 263. Of the first 100 cases, 34 died; of the second 100, 28 ; of the third 100, 23 ; of the fourth, 22. Eemarks are added on the diagnosis of uterine from ovarian tumours. Mr. Spencer "Wells has contributed a fifth series of 100 cases of ovariotomy, with remarks on the results of 500 cases to the ' Med. Chir. Soc.,' Nov. 26, 1872 (abstracts in 'Med. Journ.'). In the ' Brit. Med. Journ.,' May 18, 1872, is a short editorial, grouping together various statistics of ovariotomy. A case of unilocular ovarian 'tumour, with pelvic and intestinal adhesions, operated on successfully by Dr. "W. L. Atlee, is given. In a second case of multilocular tumour, with extensive adhesions, death occurred. ('Am. Journ. Med. Sci.,' April, 1872, 389.) Dr. "W. L. Atlee records five cases of ovariotomy. Three patients recovered and two died. In one of the successful cases there were extensive adhesions, in the two others there were none. In one case there was a pervious urachus. lu each of the fatal cases there were extensive adhesions. All were multilocular. (' Am. Journ. Med. Sci.,'July, 1872, 127.) Dr. W. L. Atlee records further cases (Oct. 1871, 409). Inone in which recovery occurred a ligature had been tied round a detached portion of peritoneum. "When this came away an artificial anus was found to exist. This gradually cloBed. During ita

288 ilEPORT ON SURGERi?. ligature passed round this small branch at once stayed the bleeding. The margins of the wound were freely touched with tincture of muriate of iron, and the edges of the wound in the neck were brought together with sutures. The patient was fed by a tube. The wound became un- healthy looking, shght ha3morrhage occurred, checked by iron. The patient gradually became weaker, and died nine days after the operation. No 'post-mortem was allowed. Mr. Annandale remarks, " The history of the case, the detection of the foreign body by means of the probang, and the condition determined at the operation are, I think, sulEcient proof that a sharp fragment of bone had lodged in the ceaophagus, and wounded its walls. This wound had been followed by ulceration, which, in its progress, had involved the arterial branch and caused the hsemorrhage. It seems probable that my first introduction of the probang ^displaced the bone, and that this accounted for the relief of the symptoms and the disappearance of the inflammatory swelling in the neck. Had the bone remained in its original position, an abscess, pointing externally, would have been the result. From the fact that no difficulty in swallowing was experienced after the introduction of the probang, it is likely that the bone passed down into the stomach. Had I not possessed a clear history of this case, and had I not also dis- tinctly felt the bone and ascertained its position, operative interference would scarcely have been justifiable; for although the blood was evi- dently coming from the pharynx or oesophagus, it was impossible to be certain as to its exact source." " The discovery that the wounded vessel was not a branch of the carotid, but of the subclavian artery, is an ex- cellent, but, at the same time, rare illustration of the important prin- ciple in the treatment of wounded arteries, namely, to search for tlie bleeding-point itself and secure it, if possible. Ligature of the carotid artery, in this case, could have had no influence in restraining the hfemorrhage from the bleeding vessel." The progress of the case, for the first few days, was all that could be desired. The fact that the patient had been hemiplegic for some time on the left side, and was not in a good state of health, tended to diminish her chance of recovery. The bleeding after the operation was only I'rom the sloughy edges of the wound in the neck, not from the oesophagus, and blood never came by the mouth. (' Edin. Med. Journ.,' April, 187a, 880.)

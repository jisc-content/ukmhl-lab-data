Mil.,' ixvi, 43) gives the following case:—A soldier, set. 29, had two years before had an attack of dyspncea, which lasted two hours, and was followed by oedema of the neck and face. On May 11, 1870, he had another suffocative attack. He had been revaccinated on the 4th; on the 1 oth his conjunctivse were slightly injected, next day the dyspncea com- menced, with a feeling of diflEculty in swallowing. There was con- siderable oedema of the velum, epiglottis, and aryteno-epiglottidean folds. The parts were scarified and sponged with a solution of nitrate of silver, with great relief. Later, oedema of the right hand and upper lip was succeeded by oedema of the right foot and lower lip. The symptoms disappeared, and the patient recovered. In the absence of any cause to be discovered in an affection of the heart or kidneys, Boelt ascribes the sudden occurrence of the oedema, which was unac- companied by any symptoms of inflammation, to hyperaemia due to paralysis of the vasciilar branches of the sympathetic nerves. Eussell ('Glasg. Med. Journ.,' 1871, iii, 209) reproduces an already published case of laryngeal obstruction, preceded by erysipelas, in a woman set. 21. Tracheotomy was performed, but the obstruction still exists and the patient still wears the canula. He gives a second case of the same kind, occurring in a female, ajt. 18, attacked with typhus. Nothing abnormal was revealed by the laryngoscope about the epiglottis or vocal cords. The laryngeal obstruction became so severe that tracheotomy was performed, and the patient was relieved. Later, the obstruction still re-

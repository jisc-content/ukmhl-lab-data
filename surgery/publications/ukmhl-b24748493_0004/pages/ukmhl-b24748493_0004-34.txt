24 ItEPOUT ON PHYSIOLOGY. Klein* contributes a good paper on the distribution of the non- medullated nerve-fibres in the membrana nictitans. He places the perfectly fresh membrane in a one-half per cent, solution of chloride of gold for an hour, next cautiously transfers it to pure water, at the same time exposing it to a bright light foV some days, and then brushes off the epithelium and mounts the specimen in glycerine. He describes four orders of nerves, the finest, which he traces to the internal surface of the capillaries and to the cells of the epithelial investment, are deli- cately varicose and require a No. 9 or 10 immersion lens. Pouchetf believes he has traced the finest branches of certain nerves into the interior of the sarcodic masses forming the chromoblasts of flat fishes where they become connected with the nucleus and pigment- granules. Dr. BealeJ in a paper in the same journal contests this statement. Sch6bl§ describes the termination of the nerves in the wing of the bat, and states that some form an extremely fine plexus, whilst others end in tactile corpuscles in close relation with the hairs, the former minister, he thinks, to sensations of temperature and pain, the latter to ordinary tactile impressions. Th. Engelmann|| gives the result of his investigations upon the inner- vation of the contractile gland-cells of the frog. He shows that these glands can be made to contract by direct irritation, by various kinds of excitation applied to the peripheric extremity of the divided sciatic nerve, and also reflectorially. Pfliiger^ shortly discusses the objections that have been advanced against his views respecting the mode of termination of nerves in glands. To show the correctness of his statements he recommends the fresh submaxillary gland of the ox or sheep to be taken and fine sections made ; these must be at once teased out with perosmic acid sp. gr. 1003, and covered with a thin glass in a shallow cell. In the case of the liver sections must be made from the fresh gland and placed in watch-glasses filled with Beale's carmine solution for fourteen days. Each section must then be washed with the above solution of perosmic acid and mounted. Other papers on the nervous system are by Gr. Valentin,** "Wundtjtt Bernstein,JJ J.

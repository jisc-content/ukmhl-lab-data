It follows that, if li be the minimum of light necessary for a normal eye, and h the minimum for a diseased eye, that I, = A. A normal eye distinguishes the objects when 7i = 2 sq. mm. If, H then, we take 2 sq. mm. to be = i, and express H by half its actual value, the value of L will always be a fraction having i for its nume- rator. The annexed table gives the mean results of the examination in a large number of diseases. In the third column are placed the degrees of acuteness of vision, and in the fifth those of the retinal sensibility. No. Diagnosis. S. Square measure of illuminating aperture. L.

In the first, from Nos. I to 7 inclusive the retinal sensibility is very little diminished. In the second, from 8 to 12, it is very considerably diminished, so much so that in many cases the full opening of 1500 square millimetres was yet insufficient. The author called attention to the fact that the morbid processes of the former group were such as to affect chiefly the conduct- ing portions of the visual apparatus, such as the fibrous and ganglionic layers of the retina, the optic nerve as far as the brain, and perhaps the brain itself, while those of the latter affected chiefly the choroid and the perceptive layer of the retina. Glaucoma had been omitted from the table on account of the variableness of the results. In inflamma- tory cases, and during the premonitory stage of cases of a certain degree of acuteness, the visual sense was much diminished. In chronic cases the results differed greatly. Some observations follo^ved on the value of this examination as a mean.s of diagnosis, e.r/. in negativing the suspicion of retinal detach- ment in a case of turbid vitreous, in which L retained a high value; and in determining the cure of syphilitic affections of the choroid. The author also used hia instrument to discover whether a scotoma was

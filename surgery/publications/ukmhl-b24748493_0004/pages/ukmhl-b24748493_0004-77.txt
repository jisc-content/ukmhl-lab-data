Univ. di Med.,' ccxvii, 31) describes the skin affections occurring in pellagra, dividing them iato the transitory ones, showing themselves in the spring time, and the chronic, which have a regular or irregular course. The first are nearly always of the erythematous type, running on into the wrongly so-called erysipelas pellagrosum. The eruption appears most frequently on the hacks of the hands, spreading from thence over a large part of the forearm, sometimes on the backs of the feet, the face, and the upper parts of the breast, all of them places exposed to the sun. The skin is more or less reddened and swollen, and the aifection may last from a few days to some months. "With the increased tempe- rature at the commencement of summer the condition of the parts affected imdergoes certain changes. Itching is never present. After the eruption ha? lasted some time the hand has a white shining appear- ance, desquamation commences in large scales, the skin below appears atrophied, has a white cicatrised look, and feels velvet]?,^ Sometimes the erythema comes out in patches, or in papules closely crowded to- gether, and here and there confluenb. More advanced stages are met with in which the redness is much deeper, and the patient complains of the burning pain, though in many cases of the worst kind cutaneous sensation is aboli.shed. Large vesicles and pustules occur, succeeded by scabs and by desquamation, and by a pigmentation lasting a longer or shorter time. In other cases, again, the vesicles stand so thick together that the affection deserves the name of eczema pellagrosum.

The principal treatise on physiology that has been published during the last two years in the English language is the fourth volume of Dr. Flint's ' Physiology of Man,' which embraces the consideration of the nervous system, and is one of the best, as it is the most complete, ex- positions of the state of our knowledge of nerve physiology that we at present possess. Dr. Bennett adds one more student's manual to those already existing, which, besides the information usually given in such text-books, con- tains three chapters or sections devoted to practical chemical physiology, to practical histological physiology, and to practical experimental phy- siology. The first of these has been written by Dr. McKendrick, and will probably prove of much service to students. Dr. Nichols has published a manual of physiology applied to social and sanitary science, which, with some errors and eccentricities, contains much thoughtful writing. Dr. Dalton has issued a fifth edition of his ' Human Physiology,' the sections in which on the liver and on reproduction are both original and excellent. Dr. Eutherford has done important service by publishing a series of lectures in the 'Lancet'for 1871-72 on experimental physiology, in which the principal facts, and the evidence supporting those facts, that have been made out during the last few years upon the functions and vital properties of muscle, nerve, and gland, are given with great clear- ness and much originality. The Sydenham Society has published a translation of the second volume of Strieker's ' Manual of Histology,' and also the first volume of Eindfleisch's ' Pathological Histology,' France has produced but little.

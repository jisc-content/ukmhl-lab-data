In a preliminary article on the pathology of hydrophobia Rudnew (' Centralbl.,' 1871, 321) asserts that the presence of foreign bodies, straw, hairs, &c., is not, as is generally assumed, an indication of the disease ; that it is by no means constant, and is not a diagnostic sign. Tie has examined microscopically all the organs in the bodies of dogs which died from or were killed during an attack of rabies. He holds that it, like almost all other infectious diseases, is connected with a pro- found disturbance of all the important organs. He confines himself in this article to the kidneys; in all his cases there was a highly deve- loped parenchymatous inflammation ; the peculiarity of which was that both cortical and pyramidal portions were alike affected, presenting all the conditions necessary for the production of uraemia. He thinks it extremely probable that the latter may be the cause of many of the symptoms. A second peculiarity was the degenerative character of tlie nephritis; in the most advanced and fatal stage of the disease the urinary tubules were completely bare of epithelium, and filled with a granular, fatty, degenerated material. Allbutt showed to the Pathological Society ('Lancet,' 1872, i, 82 ; 'Path. Soc. Trans.,' xxiii, 17) microscopic specimens from the cerebral convolutions, the central ganglia, the medulla oblongata, and the cord, from two cases of hydrophobia. The same morbid conditions, in dif- ferent degrees, were found throughout:—i, evidences of great vascular congestion with transudation into the surrounding tissues; 2, haemor- rhages of various size, with apparent fibrous exudation ; 3, small gaps due to disintegration of nerve-strands. The spleen was enlarged iu both cases. McGill, "Two Cases of Hydrophobia," ' Lancet,' 1871, i, 537. Sainter, "Chloral in Hydrophobia," ib., 1872, i, 537. Elder, "Cases of Hydrophobia, with remarks,"

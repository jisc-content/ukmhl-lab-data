IIKI'OIIT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. the disease of the aorta and the cardiac plexus, he speaks of the morbid Beriea formed by augina, aortitis, and aortic insufficiency, and in con- clusion he holds that the hypertrophy wliich generally follows in- sufficiency is not to be looked on as a compensatory and helpful process, but as a complication of the worst kind, aggravating the patient's condition. Eiegcl ('Deut. Arch.,' viii, 129) in a case described by him, recog- nised the symptom to which Duroziez first drew attention as found in aortic insufficiency—a double sound in the femoral artery. lu this case a double sound, not a blowing murmur, was audible in both femoral arteries. Witli Traube he thinks it is characteristic of a very advanced stage of insufficiency; at the same time an elastic state of the arterial •walls, and great hypertrophy of the left ventricle, are necessary re- quisites for the production of the symptom in question. Consequently, it is better heard in young people with healthy vessels and true hypertrophy of the left ventricle, while it disappears, or is diminished, in extensive atheroma of the artery and fatty degeneration of the heart. Paul ('Union Med.,' xii, 716) writes a very long paper on stenosis of the pulmonary artery after birth, its symptoms and complications, and the pulmonary phthisis which frequently succeeds it. The paper is based on twenty-seven observations. He discusses the modes in which it may occur, the almost constant secondary hypertrophy of the right ventricle, the insufficiency as well as stenosis of the pulmonary valves, and the affections of other valves of the heart which may accompany it. Its characteristic symptom is a systolic, more or less rasping murmur, heard over the origin of the pulmonary artery, and in its direction. Cyanosis is not a consequence of this stenosis.

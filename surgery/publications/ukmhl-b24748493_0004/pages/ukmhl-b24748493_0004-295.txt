SPASMODIC STUICTUUE OP THlS (ESOPHAGItS. 285 morrhages. In structure it was a firm fibroid and resembled accurately, as it dfd also in its symptoms, the well-known fibroid polypi of the uterus. One case is quoted from Paget, another from Cooper's ' Dictionary,' and one from ' Boston Med. Surg. Journ.,' all the author could find. The patients were young men. ('Am. Journ. Med. Sci.,' April, 1873, 385). Dr. Titts records the case of a woman, £et. 30. In examining her throat and while depressing the tongue he noticed a tumour rising up at its base, of about t^e size of a filbert. It was situated in the median line, so far back that it was diflGicult to pass the finger behind it. It was exceedingly hard, incompressible and im- moveable. It was not apparently pedunculated. In a few months the growth steadily increased in size, and almost filled the whole of the fauces. Prof. Bigelow operated. He removed the tumour with the ecraseur. It was pronounced fibrous or fibro-recurrent. At the end of two years there was no recurrence. ('Am. Journ. Med. Sci.,'July, 1872, 122.) Hysteric or spasmodic stricttcre of the ossopTiagus.—Sir James Paget considers this condition the homologue, in the pharynx or oesophagus, of that want of harmony between the organs of sjjeech and respiration which produces stammering and appears to depend on a want of per- fect concert between certain involuntary muscles and muscles acting under the control of the will which are designed to act in harmony. In the latter case the muscles of respiration do not act in time and imison with the organs of speech ; in the former, instead of the normal contraction of successive portions of the upper part of the alimentary canal from above downwards which transmits the food regularly from the mouth to the stomach, there occurs an unruly contraction of certain fibres which, as long as it continues, bars the passage of food as com- pletely as if some permanent obstruction existed. The degree of this contraction varies in diff'erent cases; in some it only compels the patient to take his meals apart or inconveniences him whenever his attention is in any way directed to the act of swallowing: while, in others, it produces contraction so obstinate and complete that the maintenance of life by means of gastric digestion is wholly prevented. In these cases recourse must be had to enemata, and it will be found necessary to make use of something more than beef tea and brandy, and by injecting preparations containing fats, starches, sugars, and vegetable as well as meat juices, to supply all the ingredients which are contained in a natural diet, and are essential to the building up of the various tissues of the body. Of the fact that vegetable juices could thua be efiectually introduced into the system, he had recently had very satisfactory proof in the case of a patient with whose nutritive enemata some of the essence of water cresses proposed by Mr. Wyatt had been introduced. At the end of a few days the patient had begged that the quantity of the essence might be diminished, because the flavour of the vegetable in his mouth had become so strong and so con- stant as to be extremely disagreeable.

Billroth suggests that this operation may be found practicable in cases of cancer of the oesophagus. He remarks

fiiEMATUElA—HYDATIDS^ ETC. 171 right kidney to the left is, speaking generally, as 1*12 to i. The animals bore the extirpation of one kidney well on the whole; on removal of the other they died with ur£eraic symptoms. The second kidney, though removed a long time after the first, was not always hypertrophied, and when it was so the enlargement bore no propor- tion to the period between the two operations. The increase was chiefly in weight, not in an alteration in the glomeruli and cortical siibstance. "When the animals ate well, as they frequently did, after the operation, the amount of urea excreted on the second day was almost the same, and from this fact Eosenstein concludes that the kidneys take no share in the production of urea, inasmuch as it is impossible to conceive that the remaining kidney could in so short a time take on an increased pro- cess in the work of excretion. Perl (ib., Ivi, 305) sums up his paper on the same subject as follows: — (i) The physiological growth of the kidney is essentially a hyperplasia ; the vessels alone undergo a true increase in size. (3) The compensatory enlai'gement is a true hypertrophy. (3) The various elements of the organ take a different share in this hypertrophy, the convoluted tubes and their epithelium are most concerned in it; the straight tubes, as well as the Malpighian corpuscles, apparently not at all. Shepherd (' Lancet,' 1872, i, 646) records the occurrence of hydatids in the kidney in a man, set. 51, in whom the disappearance of a tumour in the left flank was accompanied by the passage of the cysts per urethram.

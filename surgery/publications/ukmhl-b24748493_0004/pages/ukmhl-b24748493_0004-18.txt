He has also written a paper to demonstrate the presence in the blood of syphilitic patients of peculiar corpuscles. His statements are endorsed by the high authority of Prof Strieker, but have met with great opposition in Germany.* Chalvett gives the follovmig analysis of the blood in scurvy:—Fibrin 4 per cent.; corpuscles 63—100 per 1000, instead of 130 per 1000; ■water Sr^^-^, instead of 779; albumen 72-3 per 1000, instead of the normal 687. Laschkewitz J describes the red corpuscles in a case of Addison's disease, large, pale, and presenting amoeboid movements. Hosier § states that during life the blood of a highly leuc£emic patient was alkaline ; it only became acid after death. Hoppe-Seyler || finds that white blood- or lymph-corpuscles contain glycogen so long as they exhibit movements, but when they become rigid they lose their glycogen and contain sugar. Other papers on the blood-corpuscles are by E. Eay Lankester ('Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci.,' Oct. 1871), George Gulliver (idem, Jan. 1872), Braxton Hicks (idem, April, 1872), and Norris ('Transact. St. And. Med. Grad. Ass.,' 1871). Norris considers that in passing through the capillary walls the morphological elements of the blood obey the same physical laws as soap-bubbles.

heport on practical medicine. 98 H6p., 1871, 602) is very similar. In all there was proliferation of the epithelium completely filling,' up the central canal; great proliferation of nuclei in the neif^hbourhood of the ependyriia ; pigmentation of the Derve-cells, especially those of Clarke's columna vesiculosa ; and a large quantity of amyloid corpuscles. In the third case there was a sclerotic patch of connective tissue in the neighbourhood of the pons with dilated vessels. The conclusion to which the writer comes is that the seat of the lesion in paralysis agitans is to be looked for in the cord. All three cases occurred in women.

Trans.,' xxii, 27) short notes of four cases of tetanus, with an examination of the spinal cord in all. Lockhart Clarke and Dickinson report on the same specimen, and the pathological results are as follows:â€”i. Diminution of consistence of various degrees and situation in the cord. 2. Haemorrhage in two of them, visible to the naked eye. On microscopical examination: 1. Great distension of the blood-vessels in both white and grey matter, with occasional exudation and disintegration of tissue around them. 2. Isolated patches of disintegration of various shapes and sizes in both grey and white matter; and in the grey matter, numerous vacuities having, on transverse section, circular or oval outlines, and resulting from disintegration of the nerve-fibres. CliflFord-Allbutt strongly urges neurotomy as a remedial process in tetanus. JolFroy (' Gaz. Med.,' 1871, 74) gives the microscopical examination of the cord, pons, nerves and muscles, from a case of traumatic tetanus.

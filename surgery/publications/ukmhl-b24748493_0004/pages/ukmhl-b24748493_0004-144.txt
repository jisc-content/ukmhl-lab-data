In a second clnss the cardiac disease consists in imperfection of the mitral valve, and its necessary results; here the treatment is to be directed to the lungs, liver and kidneys; narcotics have only a transient benefit, often followed by increased distress. In a third class the dyspnoea is produced by failing muscular power of the heart, due to degeneration of its muscular fibre, atheroma of the vessels, idiopathic anajmia, disease of the aortic valves and dilatation. Here stimulating narcotics should be used—spirit of chloroform, camphor, senega, ammonia and Indian hemp. The paper contains suggestions as to the general dietary regulations to be fol- lowed, and concludes with the writer's experience of various drugs employed by himself.

The autopsy showed fatty degeneration of the heart, disease of the mitral valve, adherent pleura on both sides, pneu- monia of the right upper lobe, oedema of the lung, embolism of the left middle cerebral artery, with consequent softening of the corpus stria- tum and lenticular nucleus; infarcta of the kidneys and spleen; h«emorrhagic erosions in the stomach, and catarrh of the large in- testines. Murchison (' Trans. Path. Soc.,' xxii, 119) records the case of a girl, £et. 14, who had for years suffered from chorea, with mitral deficiency. While lying in bed she became suddenly unconscious, and had occa- sional muscular twitchings of the right limbs. The right pupil was contracted, the left dilated, both immovable. In addition to vegetations on the mitral valve were found embolic masses in the spleen and kidneys, and the left vertebral.and left carotid artery were much dis- tended, hard, and completely blocked by a pale, firm, easily detached

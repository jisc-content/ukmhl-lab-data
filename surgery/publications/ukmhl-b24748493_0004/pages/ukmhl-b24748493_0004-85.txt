The greater number of writers on scurvy during the last two years are to be found among the French, who seem to have had good reasons to observe the affection during and after the late war, at Paris and elsewhere. Hayem (' Gaz. Hebd.,' viii, 227) gives a sketch of the affection based on forty cases ; he recognises a primary and secondary form, the latter occurring after typhus, tuberculosis, &c. He also gives a note of eight autopsies (and see 'Gaz. Med.,' 1871, 127, ib., 157). Chalvet (' Union Med.,' t. xii, p. 525) finds the blood of scorbutic patients is more fluid and paler than normal, resolving itself into an ex- tremely dense, small clot, with an unwonted amount of serum. Becquerel and Eodin had found an increase in the number of red cells; but Chalvet finds the reverse. The amount of water and albumen is increased. LegTOux, " Le Scorbut," 'Gaz. Hebd.,'viii, 97.

Times and Gaz.,' 1871, i, 9) observed the morning and evening temperature of eleven children affected with uncomplicated rickets for eight days. The bulb was placed in the rectum for five minutes between 9 and 10 a.m. and p.m. The ages of the children ranged between 10 months and 3 years. The mean result thus obtained was 99'13° F. for the morning and 97"44° for ^'^^ evening. Fleiachmann ('Wien. Med. Woch.,' 1871, JMo. 50) treats of rachitis

llEPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. Iro characters of granular contracted kidney. The blood from the cerebral sinuses and veins contained urea. Stohr (' Deut. Klin.,' viii, 467) employed transfusion in three cases of uraemia. In the first case death was imminent, but the patient lived thirteen days after the operation. The second died in sixty-four hours, and the third in six hours after the transfusion. In the first two the urine passed after the operation contained blood-colouring matter, but no blood-cells. Pinney ('Dub. Journ.,' lii, 245) showed cirrhosed kidneys from a man, set. 20, who had passed urine in such large quantities as to sug- gest at first the possible existence of diabetes.

Journ.,' i87i,i,66) read to the Clinical Society notes of a case of paroxysmal hsematuria, and exhibited sj)ecimens of the urine. The patient, previously in good health, was seized, after exposure to cold, with nausea. His urine was the colour of porter, but after rest in bed gradually became normal. Exposure to cold eleven days later brought on another relapse. During the paroxysms the urine contained coloured granules and crystals of oxalate of lime, but no casts or blood-cells. He insists on the case being distinct from one of ordinary hsematuria. Stevens (ib., ii, 323) gives a case of "intermittent hsematuria" of more than twenty years' duration in a woman set. 75.

Arch.,' liii, 141) has made experiments on dogs and rabbits, with a view of proving whether compensatory hypertrophy really takes place in one kidney when, from some cause or other, the other kidney ceases to perform its functions. At the same time his experiments throw some light upon the share which the kidneys take in the formation of urea. He starts with the fact that the size of the

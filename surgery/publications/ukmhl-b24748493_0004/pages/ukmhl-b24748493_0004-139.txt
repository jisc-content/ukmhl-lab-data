D.—Diseases of the Circulatory System. Origin of Cardiac Murmurs, Sf c. Jacobson (" TJeber Herzgerausche," 'Berl. Klin. "Woch.,' 1871, 588) remarks that even experienced auscultators find a difficulty in ascer- tainiflg the precise coincidence of a murmur with a certain period of the heart's action. The usual attention to the pulsation of the carotid, or to the heart's impulse, is hardly precise enough in the absence of a simultaneous proof obtained by hearing and feeling. To remedy this defect he has invented an instrument, through which the movements of the artery are transmitted by a lever to an electro-mag- netic clockwork. The motion of the latter gives an audible signal, which may thus be compared with the normal or abnormal sounds of the heart. The use of this instrument is said to be as easy as that of the ordinary sphygmograph. Giese ("Versuche iiber die Eatstehung der Herztoue," 'Deut. Klin.,' 1871, .393) has repeated and confirms the experiments of Bayer on the mode of origin of the first sound of the heart. He made use of fresh calves' hearts, in which he removed the left auricle so as to expose the mitral valve, and also cut away the aortic valves. Into the 9

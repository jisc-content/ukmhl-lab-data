79 DISEASES OK TltE NEUVOUS SYSTEM. posterior lobe of the right hemisphere, surrounded by a thin layer only of brain substance. This further communicated with the lateral and middle ventricles, and terminated in a vast pouch in the posterior lobe of the left hemisphere. Numerous hydatids were found through- out the cavities. The whole brain, including the central ganglia, was more or less softened. The second case is that of a boy, ret. i8, who after frequent attacks of intermittent fever suffered from acute supra- orbital neuralgia. Hemiplegia, followed by coma, occurred, and four davs later he died. Post-mortem, the whole right iiemisphere was found to'be destroyed by a large cyst filled with hydatids. As in the former case, it was surrounded by a thin layer of brain substance, but was compressed by the skull bones. Zuber ('Gaz. des Hop.,' 187a, 730) records the occurrence of two hydatid cysts in the lung of a man, aged 22. The symptoms were those of acute tuberculosis. Eupture of one sac took place into the pleura and was followed by death. Hirschberg (' Berl. Klin. Woch.,' 1872) removed cysticerci from the eye of a woman and of a boy. The 'Lyon Me'd.' (x, 341) quotes a case recorded by Armour ('Detroit Eeview of Med.'), in which portions of taenia solium were passed by a child three days old.

Vegetable Parasites. Eichter ('Zeitschr. f.

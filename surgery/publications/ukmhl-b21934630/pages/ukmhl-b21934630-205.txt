OF THE ISCHTAS NERVOSA. 177 N CHAP, morbific matter which atts upon them, as the fler- no majioideus in the caput objlipum, are Simulated to contract and fhorten themfelves. This morbi- fic matter is for the moll part rheumatic or gouty. I have however feen a few caies of it in boys, where I had great reafon to confider it as fcrophu- lous. 1 I caufe the cylinder to be made ot cotton or charpee according to Pouteauâ€™s model, of about the length and thicknefs of three quarters of an inch. That they may not be difplaced by the blowing of the bellows, I fallen them to the fkin by means of a fmall ftripe of flicking plafter. When the cylinder is allowed to be quite burnt to allies upon the place, the effects of the fire never extend further than through the Ikin into the cel- lular membrane. The elcar occafioned by the burn is generally very long of leparating, and the wound left after this is long of healing. Upon the whole its employment is not attended with fo much pain, as the appearance of it would incline one to believe.

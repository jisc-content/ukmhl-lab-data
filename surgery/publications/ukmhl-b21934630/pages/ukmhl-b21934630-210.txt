A CASI OF ENTROPIUM. 182 a fweat, without leaving any complaint behind, except weaknefs of his breaft. In the laft attack the matter had partly thrown itfelf upon the eyes, and after it, there remained an i obftinate inflammation of the eyes, chiefly of the right one, which was at laft alfo accompanied with an entropium. As the patient was otherwife in perfect health, I ordered for him, without previous evacuations, a mixture compofed of an ounce of vin. antimon. and half a drachm of extract, aconit. of which he took 16 drops every three hours. Aug. 14th. The inflammation of the left eye,, in which there was no entropium, was totally gone, and that eye was quite clear and tranfpar- ent. In the right eye the inflammation was much diminifhed, and what remained was to be confider- ed merely as the effedt of the entropium.

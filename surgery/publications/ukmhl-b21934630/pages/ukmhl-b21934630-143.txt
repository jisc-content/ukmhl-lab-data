OF THE DYSENTERY. Ix5 I 2 The September, I have pretty frequently feen at the time of an epidemic dyfentery various other ca- tarrhous and rheumatic complaints prevail. It is not in September alone that it attacks the intef- tines; fingle cafes of dyfentery are alfo found at different times of the year. # * To thofe who maintain that there is a fpecific contagion in dyfentery I have nothing to fay. If they believe that there is in general a fpecific ca- tarrhous miafma, the influenza has given ftrong proofs of this. It might alfo if neceffary be af- ferted that the catarrhus inteflinorum is occafion- ed by a fpecific contagion. But the belief of this miafma has not yet made any effential change in the method of treating the catarrh; neither would it have any effential influ- ence on the manner of curing dyfentery. The belief of this miafma was rather a reafon for the diaphoretic method of cure recommended by me ; for I know of no miafma that can be carried off py purging.

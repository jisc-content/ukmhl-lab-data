CF BILIOUS FEVERS, 531 eaten afpai agus, and his urine having taken a ne- culiarly ftrong fmell, fufpeds morbid matter, which natuie willies to evacuate by the urine, and fo prefcribes diuretics for himfclf. If a phyfician in every diforder, whether feve- rifli or not, immediately gives purgative neutral felts, whithout having firft attentively confidered the caufe, he frequently alfo injures the patient in a different manner. The morbid matter which caufes the difeafe and which nature perhaps would have thrown off by the fkin in a few days, without lofs of ftrength, is as it were forcibly carried to the inteflines, and evacuated with the effedt at lead of weakening the powers of the digeftive organs. Diaphoretics were once alfo much abufed, but now they are almoft totally laid afide in febrile complaints, and all evacuations are made by the inteflines, which, in its turn, is alfo, in my opinion, a great error. It is from fuch imprudent evacua- tions that fo many weak flomachs and delicate fyf- tems of nerves take their origin. 0.4 2. Befides

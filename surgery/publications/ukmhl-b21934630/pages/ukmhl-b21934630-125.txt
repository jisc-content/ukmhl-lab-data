The dyfentery prevailed in Sep'ember ; in October and November rheumatic complaints alone prevailed. Difeaies of other kinds were al- io at this time united with a rheumatic character. In the middle and end of November I had fcarce a patient in the hofpital, whofe difeafe was not rheumatic or mixed with rheumatic complaints.

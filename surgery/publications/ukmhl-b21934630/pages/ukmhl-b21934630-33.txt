I determined upon cutting out the tumour, but previoufly defired the patient to remain quiet for a few clays, and to observe a proper regimen. However on the evening before the day appointed for the operation, as I once more examined the lump, which was pretty deep and firm, and while (chiefly with the intention of trying its mobility) I griped it on both fides deep and firmly, it vanilhed fuddenly from my fingers, and a yellowifli thick milk flowed from the nipple. This was really a milk tumour, which I and o- thers had taken for a true fchirrus, and it is remar- kable, that although it felt hard and folid, it was occafioned by fluid milk, and it had not begun to gather till about eight weeks after delivery, after the milk had been long gone from the breaft, and when we fliould have thought that nature mull; have long forgotten all tendency to fecrete milk.

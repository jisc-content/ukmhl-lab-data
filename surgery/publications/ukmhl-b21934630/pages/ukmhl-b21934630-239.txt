211 OF BILIOUS FEVER5, rile Ri"t of the phyfician conlifts in marking the point of time, when purgatives are no longer ufe- ful, and when diaphoretics become nectffary ; and the phyfician who is not folely occupied with what he fhould do himfelf, but alfo attends to what nature wifhes to do, will for the mod part be able to obferve this period pretty ac- curately. It is not to be fuppofed that we can evacuate by the inteftines the morbific matter which nature intends to throw off by the furface. 'This in many cafes is as .impoffible, as to convey through the inteftines by repeated purgatives the variolous poifon, which nature has deftined to the fkin. I fhall mention a cafe of this kind, in which the indications to evacuate by the inteftines and the fkin were much intermingled and very change- able. OBSERV. LIX. Ci-ir. Kohlmeyer, a mil- P 2 ler

The wound clofed after a fmall fuppuration, and then the water gra- dually collected again. Such hemorrhages happen frequently after the operation, and they may really become dangerous if they are not difcovered in time. They are very eafily flopt, but feldotn flop of their own accord. The velfels from which the blood iflues are incon- fiderable, but by the preternatural diftenfion ofthefe velfels during the fwelling of the fcrotum, and by the fudden relaxation of the fcrotum after the eva- cuation of the water, the hemorrhage from them becomes confiderable. Thefe hemorrhages, even when profufe, are rea- dily overlooked. The patient after the operation lies upon his back, and the blood runs down from, the lower corner of the wound into the bed. The patient may be drenched in blood, though the ex- ternal dreflings be dry and not difcoloured. K It

I97 OF BlLfOUS FEVERS. I here ufe the term bilious fever in the mod ex- tenfive fenfe, and underhand by it not fuch fevers only, as arife folely or chiefly from fuperabun- dant or morbid bile, but alfo all tliofe in which the morbid matter is evacuated either altogether, or principally by the inteftinal canal, whether by na- ture or by art. I fpeak therefore of fuch fevers as are cured chiefly by emetics and purgatives, and for which the moll proper name would be Jlomachic, intef- tinal, or gajlric fevers. The whole fcience of medicine confifls at pre- fent almoft entirely in the art of vomiting and purging; and it is now I think full time to lay fomething about a practice lo univerfal as this is. A weak ftomach and weak nerves are univer- sally complained of, but people do not confider that thefe afle&ions are for the moll part merely the confequence of the fafhionabie abufe ol eme- tics, purgatives, and of weakening neutral falts.

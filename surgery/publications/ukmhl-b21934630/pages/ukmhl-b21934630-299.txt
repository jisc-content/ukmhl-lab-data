OF MUCOUS CONSUMPTION. 27 I cuie chiefly depends 011 finding out the irritation, which caufes the difeafe, and on removing it. In a word the phthijis pituitofa appears to be the fame in the lungs, as the fluor albus in the uterus, and the gonorrhoea in the urethra. This is proved by the foregoing cafes, in which the difeafe was evi- dently occafioned by gaflric and rheumatic irri- tations. If weaknefs and languor were folely the caufe of this difeafe, an increafed afflux of fluids, and a more copious fecretion of mucus might at any rate be fufpeÂ£ted. But there is here a fccreiiopcr- verfa, the mucus is yellow, green, thick and re- fembles pus. It would probably be thin, copious and watery, if atoniapulmonum was alone the caufe of the difeafe. The difeafe frequently comes on fuddenly in people who previoufly had no lymptoms of weak- nefs of the lungs, and it plainly arifes from caufes 1 which could not occafion weaknefs ol the lungs.

272 OF MUCOUS CONSUMPTION. The fymptoms of the difeafe fometimes incon- teftably point out a ftimulus which aCts upon the lungs. The violent cough, the painful fenfations which many patients have in their breaft, and the irritated pulfe from the begining of the difeafe, are particulary of this kind. Alfo the termination of this difeafe in purulent phthifis is much more probably the effect of irrita- tion than of atony of the lungs. Laftly the frequent changes in the fymptoms of the difeafe, the cough being fometimes more vio- lent, fometimes flight, the pulfe being more or lefs irritated at different times, the expectoration being at one time more of a mucous nature, and at another time more like pus, fometimes colourlefs, fometimes yellow and green, give reafon to fufpeCt fometimes the more gentle fometimes the ftrong- er adfion of a ftimulus: thefe circumftances at leait cannot be accounted for by atonia pulmonum alone.

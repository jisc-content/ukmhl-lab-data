OF THE GUTTA SERENA. z6l Patients are fometimes much incommoded by the ufe of thefe pills lrom the very firlt; they are heated by them, and rendered uneafy, their head becomes afledted, their fleep ddlurbed, and the fenfations in the eyes are increafed, &c. In fuch cafes I order foluble tartar with the extraft. gra- min. or taraxac. and an emetic and purgative, as oiten as they are indicated ; and after fome time I make trial of the pills again, the ufe of which I continue, if they agree with the patient, or a- gain omit them if they do not agree. But gene- rally the patient bears them tolerably well, after having taken the foluble tartar for two weeks. Sometimes I know beforehand, that this will happen. If the patient has very much fenfation of tenfion in the eyes, often the appearance of lire before his eyes, frequent headachs, or vertigo, bad take, an irritated pulfe, the urine of a deep colour, reftlelfnefs, frequent heats, 8ec. I immediately give him the fo uble tartar, and make him continue its. ufe till thefe â€œymptoms difappear. s 3 Ths

OF THE JAUNDICE, 72 difagreeable fenfations in the abdomen, which al- ways increafed when he took the purgative falts. i Upon the molt attentive examination I could difcover nothing wrong but weaknefs and irritabi- lity, and gave him the infuf. ipecac, by which he immediately grew better. After fix days I gave him the flor. fal. ammon. martial, with rhubarb and bitters, and in a fortnight he was perfectly well. It appears to me that the jaundice often arifes, like agues, from irritation in the primse viae. The long continued ufe of deobllruents and evacuants not only fail in removing thefe difeafes, but by fuch treatment they even become worfe, and re- quire the bark. It appears too that jaundice often proceeds from an hyfteric affection of the liver alone. Real obflru&ions in the biliary ducts are very feldom the caufe of jaundice ; when they do oc- cur they occafion an incurable difeafe; for this caule neither can be difcovered nor removed. Stones

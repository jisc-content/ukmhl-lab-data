OF THE JAUNDICE. 63 To me it feems probable that the moft common caufe of jaundice is a ftimulus or irritation acting upon the hepatic fyftem, which prevents the af- flux, fecretion and excretion of the bilious fluids, or rather fo deranges the circulation in the hepatic fyftem, that the feveral parts do not reach their deftined places according to the laws of health, but are again mixed with the general mafs of the fluids. I am as indifferent about difeovering tlje way- through which the bilious fluids return to be mix- ed again with the blood, as 1 am about the rout which other morbific matters take in getting into the fyftem. Nature has many ways unknown to the anatomift. And indeed what purpofe would it ferve to know them in the treatment of difeafes. It is fufficient to fay that the caufe of the jaundice is a ftimulus, which prevents thefe fluids from tak- ing their right courfe; it is this ftimulus which mull be fought out and removed, or if this cannot be efFe&ed, its action upon the liver muft be moderat- ed

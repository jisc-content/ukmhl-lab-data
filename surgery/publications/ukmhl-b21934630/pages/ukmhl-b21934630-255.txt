OF BILIOUS FEVERS. 2 2-J tigated by theft; means, we muft not think of con- tinuing them, nor believe that we can thus totally remove the difeafe. The amendment which fol- lows an emetic or purge, too often leads a phyfi- cian into this miitake, and every body will per- ceive that by thefe emetics or purges, not only the difeafe cannot be removed, but is rendered more dangerous, and even mortal. The livers of mod people are now fo hyfteric that aim off every ftimulus ads upon the liver, and excites an hepatic falivation, and confequently molt difeafes are complicated with bilious impu- rities. Thefe bilious fluids muft be removed, be- caufe they for the moll part ad as an additional ftimulus, ana increafe the difeafe. But when they are once removed, and a certain mitigation of fymptoms has been obferved, we muft not think that we can completely cure the difeafe by evacu- ants, although this is the opinion of many. I may mention the dyfentery, of which I have al- ready treated, as the bell proof of this, for it is di- redly in point.

82 OF DIABETES* tity of fecreted urine preternatural’y increased. Increafed fecretion of urine is the effect of all di- uretics, all of which a£t by an irritation on the k dneys. We may therefore well admit that the increafed fecretion of urine in the ca'e of diabe- tes aides from the irritation of l’ome kind of mor- bdio matter on the kidneys. Stimuli 'ometimes a'ff in fuch a manner on the i k’dneys, that they fecrete urine with preternatu- ral properties. Thus in worm difeafes the urine \ frequently has the appearance of milk; the urina j’lmehiofa is occafioned by bilious irritation ; and thus from asparagus the urine receives a particu- lar Imell. We may therefore at leak admit it as poflible, that the fecond and lefs frequent kind of diabetes, in which the urine has an unnatural fmell, colour, talte and coo like nee, may alfoarife folelv fro i the irritation of fome morbific matter ■i upon the kidneys. Cafes have been a&ually observed, where the diieale was evidently occafioiKd by an irritation. Wfaytt

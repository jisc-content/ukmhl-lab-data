OF DISEASES OF THE BREASTS. I have clean wound with the mod laudable pus, and it v/as perfectly heal in eight weeks. OBSERV. XV. A lady between 30 and 40 years of age had an indurated lump in her left breaft, of the fize of a pigeonâ€™s egg, which had come on fpontaneoufly. She fometimes felt fly- ing pains in it, was otherwife in good health, and told me that fome years before file had a fimilar tumour cut out from the other breaft. I cut this alfo out at her defire. Nothing particular occur- red during the operation. The feventh day after it, hard chords which felt like tendons, made their appearance round the wound, fome of them as thick as a crow-quill. I looked upon this as a very bad prognofis, but I was miftaken, for the wound healed eafily and foon. After the wound was completely healed, it appeared that the patient was venereal.

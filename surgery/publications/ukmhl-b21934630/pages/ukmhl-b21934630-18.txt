AUTHORâ€™S PREFACE. XU The tic, temperament. I deliver what is eften- tial only, for nothing, in my opinion, is more tirefome and prolix than a dry hiftory of a cafe, copied from the daily regifters, with a number of trilling circumftances of no im- portance whatever. I have related minutely the hiftory of one cafe only. It is one in the chapter on drop- fy, where every occurrence feemed to me of value, and yet I fear the importance of thefe circumftances will not fupport the patience of my readers through the whole detail. There are many to whom it were in vain to prefent a picture, unlefs one ex- plained at the fame time what was chiefly to be obferved in it ; and it is for a reafon or the fame kind, that I have added my own remarks and opinions to the hiftory of each cafe.

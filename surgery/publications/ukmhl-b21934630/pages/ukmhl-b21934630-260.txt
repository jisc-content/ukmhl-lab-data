2J2 OF BILIOUS FEVERS. 2. Befides it w s attempted to prevent bilious fevers by emetic and purgative neutral lalts. This chiefly took place in cafes of preparation for ino- culating the fmall pox, before important furgical operations, &c. The patient was bled, confined to his room, only allowed vegetable food, all which with the addition of emetics and purgatives, debi- litated him, increafed his fenfibility and irritabili- ty, kept up a eonflant determination of the fluids to the inteftines, weakened the difpofition to crifis by the fkin, and as my own experience has repeat- edly fhown me, had preciftly an oppofite effect to what was intended ; i. e. the patient, after the operation, was attacked with a gaflric fever, which he would have efcaped, but from thefe prepara- tions ; and how indeed could it otherwife. Sanguis ejl domitor bills, faid the ancients, i. e. debilitated bodies have a difpofition to bilious difeafes. 3. The laft cafe in which phyficians adlually occafion impurities in the inteftines, is towards the end ofgaftric fevers, which during their courfe have required repeated emetics and purgatives.

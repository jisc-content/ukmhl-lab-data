OF THE EPILEPSY. 154 It is worthy of remark, that from the day {he took the flores zinci, the bitter take and fulnefs in the praecordia, which had fo frequently troubled her before, never again lhowed themfelves; a proof that bile, when it appears in difeafes, is not always the caufe of fuch difeafes, but frequently only the effect of the irritation of that difeafe, and a warning to thole who think nothing elfe necef- \ lary to cure difeafes where bile appears, except emetics and purgatives. Only to vomit and purge in difeafes where there is no overflow of bile, is often really the fame as to endeavour to / cure a falivation by mallicatories; and indeed eva- cuation in the cales juft mentioned .never produce any obfervable change on the difeafe.

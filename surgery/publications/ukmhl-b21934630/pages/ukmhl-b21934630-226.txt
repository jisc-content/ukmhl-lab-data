OF BILIOUS FEVERS. People complain that fo many difeafes now af- fume a gallric charafter, and do not reflect that many ol them are, quite contrary to the intention of nature, forced into this Hate by art, that much morbid matter is forcibly and with great lofs of flrength evacuated by the inteflines, which might have been much more eafdy removed by the fkin, or any other excretory organ, without thus facri- ficing the digeflive powers. % However much I may be convinced that eme- tics and purgatives are among the mod effectual medicines in a great number of difeafes, I am alfo certain that in many cafes they are prepofleroufly made ufe of, to the great injury of patients, and I have too often been a fpecfator and witnels of their fatal effects. For many phyficians are daily in the cuftom,when they are at a lofs what to do, and where they fliould do nothing at all, to give a purgath e fait. That I may arrange my experiments and proofs with regard to the ufe and abufe of evacuants in dileafes.

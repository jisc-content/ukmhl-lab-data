S$8 OF THE FLUXUS HEPaTICUS. thirteenth clay. I found him upon the night chair, pale as death, with a cold fweat on his face, vio- lent rumbling in his belly, almofl without a pulfe, and very near fainting. Under him was a pail nearly half full of coagulated blood, which he had voided in about two hours. This evacuation of blood ftill continued. The pain in the region of the umbilicus ftill became more violent after each evacuation, the abdomen more diftended, and then rumbling in the belly followed. I ordered cold applications to the ab- domen, gave him ipecacuanha in fmall dofes, and an infufion of millefolium, with emollient enemata, and the evacuations gradually became lefs fre- quent and weaker, and at laft altogether ceafcd. In three days he had a new attack, but it was foon quieted by the above mentioned means. From this time he had a true fluxus hepaticus, which lafted ten days, and which was always ac- companied with colic pains about the navel, more or lefs violent at different times, and the fluid e- vacuated.

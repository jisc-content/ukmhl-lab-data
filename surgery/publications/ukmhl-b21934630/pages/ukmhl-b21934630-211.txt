A CASE OF ENTROPIUM. 183 CHAP. Aug. 23d. I operated upon the entropium and united the wound. 31. The wound was heal. The hairs and eye- lids were in their proper pofition. I made h.m ufe a folution of white vitriol as an eye-water, as the cornea of the eye on which the operation had been performed was very opaque. I have often performed the operation for the entropium, and have for the moil part found, that however much fkin I had cut away, I Hill had not cut off enough, and that confequently I had only leifened, not cured the entropium. The external fkin of the eye-lid is fo extenfible that 1 advLfe e- very one to cut off more, and indeed much more of the external fkin of the eye-lid than appears ne- ceffary. N 4

OF AMPUTATION OF THE THIGH. 25O the cut, I not only divided the fkin, but alfo the cel- lular membrane to the external furface of the mufcles; this is neceflary to admit of the fkin being pulled ftrongly back. If the cellular mem- brane be not entirely divided, it will generally be found that it contracts, when the fkin is pulled upwards, and by that means prevents the fkiq from being drawn up very far. Whilft the afiiftant now drew back the fkin as far as poflible, I once more with a fecond circular incifion, cut through the cellular membrane as far as the mufcles, juft below the edge of the retrac- ted fkin, by which means the afiiftant was enabled to draw the fkin confiderably higher than before ; fo that the upper edge of the fkin, was at leaft three large finger breadths diflant from the under. It is therefore not at all neceflary to follow Allan- fonâ€™s advice of difie&ing and turning back the fkin all round from the fubjacent mufcles. A practice which is both tedious and troublefome. / With the third circular incifion I cut through

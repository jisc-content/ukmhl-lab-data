2 52 OF AMPUTATION OF THE THIGH. The adhefive plafier ; the flefh of the flump was prefl- ecl together by means of a bandage, and of bol- flers of charpee placed on both fides of the flump. The ends of the ligatures hung out of the under I and back corner of the wound. So little fever followed that the patient got no medicine whatever during the whole time of the cure. Even the hedlic fever foon dil'appeared, fo that the patient was entirely free from fever on the ninth day. On the fifth day, when the bandages were taken off, three quarters of the upper part of the wound were united and quite dry, the under part, out of which the ligatures hung, was rnoifl, but dis- charged only a few drops of purulent matter during the whole cure. On the eighth day, the open part which was in the moll depending corner of the wound, was fcarcely a fingerâ€™s breadth. On the eleventh day, the threads of the ligature dropt off, and the remaining fmall opening clofed in a few days.

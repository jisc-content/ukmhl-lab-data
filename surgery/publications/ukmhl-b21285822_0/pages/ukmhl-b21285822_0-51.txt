15 MOVEMENTS OF VOLUNTARY MUSCLE of the striae, has ever given, or attempted to give, a genuine representation of them copied from nature, detached from the structures to which they are said to be connected, and ihat until this be done, the proof of their existence as an element of muscular organization, must be allowed to be deficient. Now if it be true that these cross markings are the effect of an adaptation side to side of the beads of contiguous fibrillae, and that these fibrillae compose the whole thickness of the fasciculus, it is obvious that the striae ought to be found not at the surface alone, but throughout the whole interior of the fasciculus ; and this is rigorously the case. Owing to the transparency of the fasciculi, it is perfectly easy, under a high power, to bring into focus whatever portion of their interior the observer may choose. On bringing the surface nearest to him first into view, the points noticed early in this paper usually present themselves, and as the focus descends into the interior, the striae seem commonly to undergo a slight lateral motion, but continue to be perfectly well defined, until at length they gradually become less clear, or are suddenly lost, according to the thickness of the object The slight motion sideways, which is so very generally observed, is of course merely a deception resulting from the striae seen in succession at any one point not being all precisely in a plane vertical to the observer, but slanting one way or the other from him, so that the focus in following the slant seems to move aside. Though I am not aware that this remarkable fact of the existence of the striae throughout the fasciculus, has hitherto been noticed by anatomists, it appears to me not only to be solely explicable by considering the striae merely an appearance occasioned by the lateral cohesion of a bundle of marked fibrillae, but also, in its turn, to be a proof amounting to demonstration, that such is in reality their nature. A3 far as my experience goes, it is uniformly to be observed wherever the striae are distinct, and it will be decisive in proportion to the transparency and bulk of the fasciculus. Moreover, if the fibrillae happen to have been partially or quite deranged, so that their segments no longer conspire to form striae, but are visible in separate longitudinal rows, these characters are visible in the interior as well as on the surface, and are not lost till the focus passes beyond the object on the opposite side. It will follow from the view of the striae now taken, that they are in truth the edges of focal sections of plates or discs, arranged vertically to the course of the fasciculi, and each of which is made up of a single segment from every fibrilla. The connections between contiguous discs are at least as numerous as the fibrillae, and consist of those parts of the fibrillae which connect their segments into one thread. Whether these are the whole attachments, I have not yet succeeded in satisfying myself. That there are also special means of connexion between the segments of contiguous fibrils, whereby the discs are more or less compactly constructed, is ver}r evident from the regularity with which the fibrillae maintain their apposition with one another; and it is not a little singular that this should have attracted the attention of anatomists to so small an extent as it seems to have done. This is also

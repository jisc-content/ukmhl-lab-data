87 NOTE BY SIR WILLIAM BOWMAN, 1891. [The work entitled 'Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Man' was projected by the Authors in November, 1839, and was published in Parts, of which the first appeared in February, 1843 ; the second (completing Vol. I.), in April, 1845 ; the third, in April, 1847 ; and the fourth and last, in December, 1856. As stated in the " Advertisement" to Vol. I. (April, 1845), " the Authors had had a joint share in its composition, and were equally responsible for all that it contained." When, some time ago, Dr. Burdon Sanderson acquainted me with his wish to include in the present collection of publications of mine certain portions of this joint work, which he had selected, I felt some doubt whether this wish could be acceded to by me with perfect justice to the memory of my friend. But, on consideration, I have felt that, had Dr. Todd survived me, he would certainly have given his willing sanction to the reprinting as mine of what appears below. It is perhaps hardly necessary to state that all the illustrations to the book, assigned to " The Authors " were, in fact, from drawings of mine, since my colleague did not use the pencil. These in number amounted to 120, while the remaining 178 were taken in whole or in part from other specified sources. Through the two Volumes the Chapters were numbered in sequence from 1 to 44, and the Figures also in sequence from 1 to 298. This numbering is retained in the present reprint, for convenience of reference. SUMMARY. Volumes. Parts. Dates of Chapters. Pages. Figures Totals. Publication. by w.

The authors have had a joint share in its composition, and are equally responsible for all it contains. Incorporated in various parts of the work, the reader will find opinions expressed, relating both to the structure and functions of parts, more or less at variance with those generally received. To these the authors for the most part have been led during their anxious attempts to render their descriptions direct and faithful transcripts from nature. Historical details, conflicting statements, and intricate discussions of doubtful physiological questions, have been almost wholly avoided, as being inconsistent with the end in view. The authors desire to acknowledge their obligations to Mr. Vasey, the able and intelligent artist, by whom the engravings have been executed on wood. They have likewise to express their regret at the delay which has occurred in the progress of their work. When the First Part was published in February, 1843, it was thought that the remainder might appear in two more Parts in the course of the following year. As their labours proceeded, however, it became necessary, in some measure, to modify the original plan, and to produce the work in two Volumes, of which the First is now complete. The remaining Volume will follow in two Parts at an early period. King's College, London. April, 1845.

Peevost and Dumas, at a later period,! described the same zigzag flexure of the fibres during contraction, and further imagined it to be an electrical effect produced by the passage of the nerves across them at their angles of flexure. This doctrine was too captivating not to obtain very general credence, especially as it seemed to fall in with a notion, at that time very current among speculative physiologists, that the nervous influence is a form of electricity. But its validity has of late begun to be questioned; Professor Owen,J in small filarise and in a species of vesicularia, observed a fact opposed to it, viz., the bulging of the (unstriped) fibres near their centre, without their falling out of the straight line, in contraction. A similar fact was observed in the case of the (unstriped) muscles of the Polypifera, by Dr. A. Farre;§ and Dr. Allen Thomson, || on repeating the experiment of Hales and Prevost on the Frog, " observed single fibres continuing in contraction, and being simply shortened, and not falling into zigzag plicse; and he was led to suspect, from this and other circumstances, that the zigzag arrangement was not produced until after the act of contraction had ceased." M. Lauth, after a careful investigation, concludes^" that a fibre may shorten with or without zigzag inflection. Such, I believe, was the state of this question in 1840, when I published the observations,** on part of which the account of the nature of contraction, given in the present article, is principally based. In the following year I added ft a note, on the appearances met with in human muscle ruptured by tetanic spasm, and which seemed to me to prove that the conclusions I had previously drawn from the phenomena of the rigor mortis were true as regards the act of contraction, as it occurs in the living body.

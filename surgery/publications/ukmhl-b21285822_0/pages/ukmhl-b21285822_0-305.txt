257 MUSCULAR MOTION. From the ' Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology,' Vol. III. Under this head it is intended to consider the contractility of muscle, its source, the stimuli that excite it, and the nature of the minute movements occurring during the act of contraction. a. Of the Contractility of Muscle. This subject having already been ably discussed in this work [see " Contractility "), I shall here confine myself to such a brief statement as may appear to be required by the advance of knowledge since the publication of the article in question. 1. Is it a property inherent in the muscular fibre? Are we to believe in the "vis insita" of Holler?â€”The supporters of this opinion have always been exposed to the objection that in the cases of contraction adduced by them as the effect of a topical or immediate stimulus, the isolation of the muscle from all connection with nervous fibrils has not been demonstrated. Moreover, what has generally been regarded as their strongest ground, viz., the statement that involuntary muscles are not capable of being excited to contraction by irritation of their nerves, has lately been shown by the numerous experiments of Muller, Valentin, and others, to be erroneous and unworthy of credit. But I have elsewhere""" adduced the evidence of direct microscopical observations made on living fragments of the elementary fibre of voluntary muscle, entirely isolated from every extraneous tissue, whether nerve or vessel, to show that this is a property inherent in this tissue, and that, whatever be its source, it is capable of being brought into action by a stimulus topically applied. Thus, when such a fragment is examined, contraction is found to occur first at its broken extremities, and if water (which has long been known to be a rapid * ' Philosophical Transactions,' 1840, p. 487. 2 M 2

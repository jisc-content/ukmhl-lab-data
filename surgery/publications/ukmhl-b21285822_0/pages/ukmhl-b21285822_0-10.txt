IV GENERAL PREFACE. The publication of the present volumes completes the task of the Committee. Their interest and value have been added to by the active interest taken in them by Sir William Bowman till nearly the very day of his death. Every proof sheet has been revised by his own hand and frequent notes appended. The Committee believe that these volumes will furnish a most valuable con- tribution to the modern history of Science, especially in the departments of Physiology and Ophthalmology. They have to congratulate the subscribers on the acquisition of Professor Buedon-Sandeeson and Mr. Hulke as editors. The accounts were audited on December 11th, 1890, by Professor Michael Fostee, F.E.S. After the payment of all expenses of the portrait a balance of one hundred and ninety-eight pounds remains, which has been utilised in diminishing the cost of the present volumes to subscribers. W.

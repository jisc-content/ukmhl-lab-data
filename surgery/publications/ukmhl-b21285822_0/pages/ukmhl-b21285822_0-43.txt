The class of Fishes has fasciculi nearly four times the thickness of those of Birds, which present the smallest of all. Next to Fish come Insects, then Reptiles, then Mammalia. In each of these different classes an extensive range of bulk is observable, some fasciculi being three, four, or more times the width of others. In the above measurements precautions have been taken to include only specimens in an uncontracted state, the importance of which will be seen in the sequel.

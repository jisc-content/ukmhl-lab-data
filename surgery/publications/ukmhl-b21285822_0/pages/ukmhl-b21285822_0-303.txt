CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OE MUSCLE. 255 identical with that of which they consist, may possibly be the effective agent to which are due those wonderfully vivacious movements witnessed in the bodies of many of the minutest infusoria, where the best microscope can hardly do more than discern the organs thus put in motion. And it seems far from an unphilosophical view of the nature of ciliary motion, to refer it to the contractions of a tissue not entirely different in kind from the muscular. The elementary fibres of muscle, diminutive though they be, and hardly discernible with the eye, are yet gross organs in comparison with those which the microscope enables us to conceive capable of being formed out of them, without any necessary destruction or even injury of their contractile power. F. Chemical Constitution. There is little to add on this subject to what will be found under the head of "Eibrine." By the aid of the microscope, however, our knowledge has been rendered somewhat more precise, as to the chemical properties of the elementary structures existing in the fibres. If any substance capable of dissolving fibrine (as liq. ammonias) be added to the muscular fibre, this is seen to swell, to lose more or less completely its transverse and longitudinal markings, and to exhibit at once those corpuscles or cytoblasts, which before lay concealed among the sarcous elements. These corpuscles and the sarcolemma are not affected, but the sarcous elements are almost entirely taken up. But for however long a time the fibre be exposed to the alkaline menstruum, there will always remain a kind of web, of extreme tenuity and transparency, from which the sarcous elements appear to have been withdrawn. This may be seen in a transverse section of a muscle that has been thus treated, then washed and dried. I have not been able to detect in it any sort of structure 2 M

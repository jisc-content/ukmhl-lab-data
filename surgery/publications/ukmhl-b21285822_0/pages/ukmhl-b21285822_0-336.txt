THE PACINIAN BODIES. 288 British and Foreign Medical Eeview' for January, 1845, and in the following April Dr. Todd and myself gave an account of these structures, drawn up from original observations and containing some new results, though on the whole confirmatory of those previously published. See the ' Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Man,' vol. i., p. 395. It is right to add that MM. A. G. Andeal, Camus, and Laceoix met with these bodies in 1833, and that they were noticed subsequently by Ceuveilhiee and Blandin in their respective works on descriptive anatomy, but without any real light being- thrown on their nature or internal structure.

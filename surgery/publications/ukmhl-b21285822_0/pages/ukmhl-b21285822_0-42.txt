6 MR. BOWMAN ON THE MINUTE STRUCTURE AND to 8), in which it will be seen that the sections present almost every variety of figure that can be'enclosed by from three to six or more sides. In some examples, most of the angles are sharp and decided, while others are rounded off, so as to leave spaces between the contiguous fasciculi, often for the passage of vessels. In other instances most or all of the fasciculi have the angles so much rounded that they are not very much removed from the cylindrical shape. These are by far the least common, and I have only met with them in birds. In insects the fasciculi are often flattened bands. (Fig. 2, Staghorn Beetle.) The primitive fasciculi vary considerably in bulk in different classes and genera of animals, and even in the same animal and the same muscle. In the course of my inquiry I have noted down the average diameter of the fasciculi in the specimens examined; and in the following Table, examples of these measurements are exhibited. It is to be observed that where the admeasurement is single, it is an average of many, and two numbers denote the extremes met with. Table.

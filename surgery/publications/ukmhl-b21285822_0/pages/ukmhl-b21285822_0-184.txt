136 VESICULAR MATTER. granular sheath to the vesicle, and to its processes when they exist, increases greatly the difficulty of examining them. It is not easy to detach them from this investment. This is generally effected by accident more than by skill in manipulation, and it is along the broken margin of the piece under examination that we shall succeed in detecting the most perfect vesicles. In most situations where vesicular matter is found in the nervous centres, tubular fibres of small though variable size mingle with its elements in greater or less number, and in some places both varieties of fibre are found. (See figs. 57 and 58.) To determine the precise connection which these respective elementary parts form with each other is a problem of the deepest interest. No more, however, can be said respecting it at present, than that the relation of nerve-fibres to nerve-vesicles in the centres is most intimate, and that the latter are rarely met with without one or more of the former in immediate connexion with them.

127 RHYTHMICAL CONTRACTION. respiration. The voluntary, or irregular action, however, is entirely subordinate to involuntary, and rhythmical. The rhythmical character of the respiratory act is to be explained by reference to the stimulus by which it is ordinarily excited. This is an impression made on the internal surface of the lungs by the deteriorated air, and recurs periodically from the change induced in the inspired air by its contact with the blood in the air-cells. Though the heart is in no respect under voluntary influence, yet emotional and instinctive impulses easily affect it: its action is throbbing, tumultuous, or feeble. These impulses act through the cardiac nerves, which, if stimulated mechanically, will excite contractions in a heart removed from the body, and which has almost ceased to beat; but, under all circumstances, the action of the heart is rhythmical. The cause of the rhythm it is exceedingly difficult to resolve. This variety of contraction is coincident with periodic distension of the cavities, and impressions on their lining membrane. But it continues long after the heart is empty, and its nerves cut. Hence, whatever share these circumstances may have in giving the rhythmical character in the natural condition of the parts, they are certainly not essential to each individual pulse. It is singular that a mechanical stimulus applied once to the heart will often excite a series of contractions after they have ceased, or modify the rhythm of those previously existing; its effects being thus prolonged through many beats.

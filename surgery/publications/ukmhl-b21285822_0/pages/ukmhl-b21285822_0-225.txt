177 ON THE COCHLEA From ' The Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Man,' Vol. II, Chapter XVIII, pp. 76 to 81. Published December 1st, 1856. Of the Structure of the Spiral Lamina of the Cochlea. We shall term the two surfaces of this lamina tympanic and vestibular, as they regard respectively the tympanic or vestibular scala. The osseous portion of the spiral lamina extends more than half way from the modiolus towards the outer wall, and is perforated, as already described, by a series of plexiform canals for the transmission of the cochlear nerves; these canals, taken as a whole, lie close to A, Section of the cochlear canal where the scalse are equal, sv, Scala vestibuli. st, Scala tym- pani. o, Osseous zone of lamina spiralis, d, Denticulate lamina, to, Membranous zone, c, Cochlearis muscle, r, Osseous rim of the groove of the cochlearis.

The vestibular surface of the osseous zone presents in about the outer fifth of its extent, a remarkable covering, more resembling the texture of cartilage than anything else, but having a peculiar arrangement quite unlike any other with which we are acquainted. Being uncertain respecting the office of this structure, we shall term it the denticulate lamina (figs. 137 and 138), from a beautiful series of teeth,

171 ON THE OLEACTOEY REGION. From ' The Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Man,' Vol. II, Chapter XVI, pp. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Published December 1st, 1856. We now come to the proper seat of the sense of smell, a comparatively limited district of the nasal organ, to which we shall apply the term, olfactory region. As this olfactory region has not hitherto been distinguished, nor its character understood, we shall describe it somewhat minutely. This, as well as other parts, can be best examined in animals, because they can be procured fresh and in a state of health. The mucous membrane so soon loses many of its most interesting features, especially where death has followed on chronic disease, that the human subject is not the most favourable for the investigation of its physiological anatomy, and can only be a, Surface of the epithelium. b, Layer coloured by pigment, c, Line of base- ment membrane, d, Nucleated tissue seen below. e, Olfactory nervous filament branching.

This remark is well illustrated by the present instance. The olfactory region is situated at the top of the nose, immediately below the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, through which the olfactory nerves reach the mem- brane ; and it extends about one-third or one-fourth, downwards on the septum, and over the superior and part of the middle spongy bones of the ethmoid. Its limits are distinctly marked by a more or less rich sienna-brown tint of the epithelium, and by 2 A

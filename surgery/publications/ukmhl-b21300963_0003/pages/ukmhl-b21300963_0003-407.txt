lecture VI. 265 that which has been deduced in the intio ductory lectures; that vibratory actions occurring in the nerves in consequence of impressions made on them, are transmitted to the brain, and variously affect that which is perceptive. It is evident to reason that our perceptions have no rational corres- pondence to the causes producing them ; and nature may have allotted to animals various kinds and degrees of perception adapted to their wants, and the situa- tion they occupy in the scale of existence. No one can guess what kind of vision belongs to the fly. There are probably 25,000 hexagonal lenses or menisci on its surface, or the same number 01 distinct visual organs, as some Comparative Anato- mists would have us to believe. Some animals may have great susceptibility to light, odour, and sound, and yet may not possess great general susceptibility. We find indeed, in many instances, organization adapted to function, and yet it is highly improbable, that we shall ever be able to explain function by means of our know- ledge of organization.

LECTURE I.. 2 reasons, which I have partly explained In my first Lectures, to uphold it as a good theory, till a more satisfactory one be dis- covered. I have praised him, because his perception of the healthy state of the vital processes enabled him to discern and in- vestigate the causes and effects of disorder and disease in a manner and degree that have produced a most important revolution in medical science. I now mean to praise him for the great labour of his life, his Museum ; which I may call the principal record of his deeds and opinions. Hitherto I have endeavoured to make the Anatomical Lectures subservient totfk surgical subjects I had afterwards to discuss. Finding myself rather at a loss for such topics, particularly because this theatre is unsuited to anatomical demonstrations, it occurred to me, that it might be useful to re- present to my present audience, what were the peculiar improvements Mr. Hunter made in Physiology, and also the degree of perfection to which he brought that science.

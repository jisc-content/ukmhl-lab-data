In animals thus nou- rished, in which there is no circulation, there can be no distinct respiratory organs ; neither do they want them, for their blood or nutritive fluid, is every where exposed to circumambient air. In the animals included in the class of vermes, according to the arrangement in Professor Cuvierâ€™s lectures, many of which have red blood, and therefore its motion is more apparent, we meet with the first generally acknowledged instance of cir- culation, They have a dorsal vessel run- ning the whole length of the animal, which is large in the middle, and be- comes gradually smaller towards either end.

The second and third joints of the fingers are formed into hinges, admitting only of flexion and ex- tension. The last bones of the fingeis aie very small, the nail causing the apparent breadth of the end of the finger. The thumb consists of three bones, the first of which is articulated to the carpus, and the joint appears like a hinge, though from the looseness of the ligaments, it admits of a small degree of motion in veiy various directions ; which motions appear more considerable than they really are, when their effect is observed, as the extre- mity of so long a radius as the thumb makes.

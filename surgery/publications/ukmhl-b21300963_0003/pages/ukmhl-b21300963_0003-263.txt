LECTURE III. 121 connected to the transverse processes. The ribs successively and considerably in- crease in length, as far as the seventh, which causes the cavity they encompass to become larger; they then diminish in length, and the cavity of the chest becomes smaller. The seven upper ribs are connect- ed by gristles to the breast bone. The five lower have their gristles united with each other, or have no connection except with the vertebral column. The breast bone is placed very obliquely, so that at the top it is very near tlie vertebral column, whilst at the bottom it is very distant. The ribs, in proceeding from the dorsal vertebrae, first take a direction backwards, and then rather suddenly turn forwards, so that the vertebral column projects into the cavity of the chest. This circumstance, and the oblique position of the sternum, both con- tribute to render the weight, before and behind the vertebral column, equiponde- rant upon its basis, in the manner I have formerly mentioned.

LECTURE II. 77 natural result of thought, and the cause of conduct. If errors of thought terminated in opinions, they would be of less conse- quence ; but a slight deviation from the line of rectitude in thought, may lead to a most distant and disastrous aberration from that line in action. I own I cannot readily believe any one who tells me, he has formed no opinion on subjects which must have engaged and interested his attention. Per- sons both of sceptical and credulous cha- racters form opinions, and we have in general some principal opinion, to which we con- nectthe rest, and to which we make them sub- servient ; and this has a greater influence on all our conduct. Doubt and uncertainty are so fatiguing to the human mind, by keeping it in continual action, that it will and must rest somewhere; and if so, our enquiry ought to be where it may rest most secure- ly and comfortably to itself, and with most advantage to others ? In the uncertainty of opinions, wisdom would counsel us to adopt those which have a tendency to pro- duce beneficial actions.

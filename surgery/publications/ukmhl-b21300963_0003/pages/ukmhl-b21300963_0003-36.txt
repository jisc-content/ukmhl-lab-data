LECTURE I. 20 sight. Yet there are some who assert, that by the aid of powerful lenses, each fibre, though slender as the threads of flimsy gossamer, appears but as a muscle in minia- ture, being composed of a number of smaller fibres. There are others who main- tain the contrary, and affirm that they can see the ultimate muscular fibres. It would seem to me a waste of time to detail to you the reports of various microscopical ob- servers, respecting the ultimate fibres of muscles, since there is so little concurrence or certainty in their descriptions. The opi- nion which such contradictory statements have impressed on my mind, is, that per- haps the ultimate arrangement of matter, like its ultimate particles, may form a sub- ject too subtile for human perception. Our information in these respects must be li- mited, as our powers of perception have their bounds. The imperfection of the human senses, docs not, however, seem a subject of regret; because it induces a greater necessity for the exertions of intel- lect; and many subjects appear far more demonstrable to reason than to sense.

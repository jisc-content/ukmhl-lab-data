49 LECTURE II. distinction seems a natural and useful one, and throws light on the physiology of the visceral nerve. In vegetables, and in some of the lower kinds of animals, no traces of a nervous system are discoverable. In others of the lower order of animals, that have organs for the preparation and distri- bution of nutriment, they are supplied by a visceral nerve, which it is probable main- tains amongst those organs a concurrence of impressions and actions. In the ascend- ing complexity of the nervous system, we find a nervous chord more or less beset with ganglia, which supplies other parts of the body besides the viscera, and which probably serves to maintain amongst them likewise a concurrence of impressions and actions. We next find at one end of this chord a kind of ganglion, or brain, which gradually becomes larger and more complex as we trace the series of links upwards to man, in whom it bears a much larger pro- portion to the nervous system in general than in any other animal. The visceral nerve, in the ascending series of animals, appears connected with the animal nerves ; E

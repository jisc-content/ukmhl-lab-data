Professor Cuvier,' in his account of the organs for the distribution of nourishment in the class of vermes, principally appeals to the evi- dence of what may be seen in the areni- cola, or lumbricus marinus of Linneus. Sir Everard Home, being particularly desirous of examining the circulation in this ani- mal, on account of its having external branchiae, sent for Mr. Clift to the coast of Sussex for this purpose ; and their conjoint observations on the vessels and circulation in this and other vermes, are printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1816. That Mr. Hunter was as well acquainted with the circulation in animals of the worm kind, as any of his successors, is I think, evident from his writings.

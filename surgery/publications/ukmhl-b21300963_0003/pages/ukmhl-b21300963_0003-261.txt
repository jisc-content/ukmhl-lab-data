119 LECTURE III. Had the vertebral column been formed straight, arid the same extent ol motion (riven to the head, the weight would have so preponderated, that its support would not only have been difficult, but it might have operated injuriously to the fabric ol the co- lumn itself. As the column is constructed, when either end of it is projected in one direction, the other can be carried in the opposite, and the balance preserved. Thus, when the loins are brought forward, the neck and head can be carried backward, so as to preserve the line of gravity perpendi- cular to the basis of support; and vice vei'sa in all directions. By constant practice, the muscles are so habituated to produce these opposite and balancing motions, as involuntarily to do so with the greatest exactness, as well as to co-operate with the elasticity of the column, in restoring it to its proper direc- tion and form. The requisite actions are slight, transient, and varied, and therefore produce no fatigue. This circumstance,^ together with the disposition of the column i 4

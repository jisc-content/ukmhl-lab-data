lecture V. 233 in the larger trunks, in a manner which I had never before seen demonstrated, except by injections of quicksilver. In dissecting this hand, the vessels which transmitted the injection from the arteries into the veins were apparent. Some artifice is, however, necessary to our success, in making these preparations. We should suffer a part to become slightly putrid, be- fore we inject its vessels, which produces a yielding state of them, favourable to the transit of the injection. Yet there are arte- ries which terminate in veins, so small, as not, in their natural and healthy state, to transmit even coloured blood, so that there is, in fact, something similar to a specula- tion of Boerhaaveâ€™s, something like a de- scending series of vessels. It also evidently appears, that the great mass of the blood is freely transmitted from the arteries into the veins, so that it rapidly and regularly circulates ; and we therefore conclude, that but a small portion passes into the finer vessels, there to undergo those modifica- tions which fit it for the production of the secretions, and the various materials for the nutriment of the body.

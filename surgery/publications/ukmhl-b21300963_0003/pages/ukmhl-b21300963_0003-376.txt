LECTURE V. 2S4> The veins freely communicate with one another, and joining together, they form tubes of apparently larger dimensions, but of less actual calibre than the branches by which they were formed ; so that in these vessels the blood is obliged to pass through converging channels which eventually end in the two venas cavse, the conjoined areas of which are inconsiderable when compared with the space the blood has occupied in all the minute veins of the body. Consequently if the heart pumps out an ounce and a hall of blood at each action into the arteries, and the same quantity is returned, in the same time, to that organ by the veins, it must be urged in the like interval from the small arteries into the veins, and run with accelerated velocity as it approximates to the heart. Of this circumstance we may, I think, be convinced by ocular demon- stration, even in the ordinary practice of our profession. There is much more space in the veins than in the arteries, which pre- vents any trivial obstruction in the former channels from impeding the transmission of the Wood into them through the lat- ter. The superficial veins which meander

Carbone is evidently thrown off, 'and a change produced, of the precise na- ture of which we are ignorant, but which is rendered evident to our senses by a change of colour; for the purple current acquires a scarlet hue, or, as it is commonly ex- pressed, the venous blood becomes arte- rious. Chemists have considered the change as contributory to the production of animal heat; which opinion may indeed be true, though the manner in which it produces such an effect, has not as yet been explain- ed.” Mr. Hunter, who believed that life had the power of regulating temperature, inde- pendently of respiration, says nothing of that process as directly contributing to such an effect.

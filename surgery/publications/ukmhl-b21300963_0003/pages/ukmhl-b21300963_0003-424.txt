LEET-URE VI. through which gaseous and watery fluids containing some mucilaginous and saline substances are eliminated from the circu- lating system. We see the sweat escaping from regular pores, and not irregularly transuding, as if it passed through in- terstices in the cuticle. Substances rubbed on the skin, gain entrance into the absorb- ing vessels, and it is very improbable that they pass through the compact cuticle, in order to arrive at their orifices. We see the ducts of the oil-bags terminating on the surface of the cuticle. It seems here right to observe, that myriads of oil-bags are disseminated throughout the skin, from which ducts proceed to the surface of the cuticle to anoint it every where ; and that it is most liberally oiled in parts subject to the greatest friction or evaporation. If we throw water upon our arms, we find it re- pelled in globules, as from a greased sur- face. Every hair also receives a small co- vering from the cuticle, as it penetrates that substance; which covering so tena- ciously adheres to it, that in taking off the cuticle, when the skin is slightly putrid,

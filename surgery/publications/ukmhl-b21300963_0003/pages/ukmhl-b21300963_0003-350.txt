208 LECTURE V. though not sufficiently explanatory, must, I think, principally have been suggested by what is observable in animals of this class. I am, however, aware that the mo- tion of the blood in the vessels of the chicken and its appendages before they are conjoined, and a circulatory motion conse- quently established, might have suggested the same expression. In worms, we see the dorsal vessel pretty suddenly filling, till it is distended with blood; it then con- tracts, urging on its contents, till it is empty, when, after a time, it is again reple- nished. Thus wave follows wave, but the cause of this interrupted, or seemingly un- dulatory motion, has not perhaps been fully explained. Analogy would induce us to consider the systole and diastole of the dorsal vessel, as similar to what is observed in the heart of the higher classes of ani- mals, and that the tardiness of the circu- lation is the cause of this apparently un- dulatory motion. The spiracula or tracheae in the sides of worms terminate in vesicles, which are con-

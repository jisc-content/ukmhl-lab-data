In those animals that leap to great heights or distances, the os calcis pro- O D 1 jeets, so as to form a most enormous lever, •and we judge of the animal’s powers by observing this projection. Such is the mechanism of our lower limbs, nor need I endeavour to shew its excellence, by the effects resulting from it. Every one knows from what heights we can leap, to what heights we can spring, and to what distances we can bound, without in- jury ; as well as how swiftly we can run, how firmly we can stand, how nimbly we can dance, and how perfectly we can ba- lance ourselves upon the smallest surfaces of support.

Gravitation seems to be the chief cause which gives fixity of position to some parts, and consequent freedom of motion to others. When we stand upon one limb, we balance our weight upon the head of the thigh bone, and no effort is required to maintain our position, but what is necessary

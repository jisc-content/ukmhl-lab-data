He im- mediately applied himself to the study of ana- tomy and surgery, and, for several years, he was employed in the dissecting-room, where he suddenly began to display his uncommon abi- lities. The doctor was anxious that he should go into partnership with him, and in the year 1758, declared him to be fully adequate to the important office of a Teacher; but Mr. Hun- ter, with a modesty which is always the at- tendant of genius, felt insuperable embarrass- ments and objections to speaking in public, and he declined the advantageous and honor- able offer, on account of his aversion to public speaking, and his extreme diffidence of his own abilities and skill. But he continued in the same anatomical pursuits till the year I76O j when, anxious for a more enlarged field of ob- servation, he went out as Surgeon General to the Army, first to Belleisle, and afterwards to Portugal.

The muscles were however unable to move the retracted part of the patella, because they had already withdrawn it to the utmost extent of their original power.

He per- suaded his patient to sit on a table, and suffer her legs to swing backwards and for- wards. This they did in the same manner and from the same causes that a pendulum does. She could indeed retract the limbs further under the table than their pendu- lous motion would carry them, by the agency of their flexor muscles, but she could neither check their motion in this di- rection, nor prolong it in the opposite one, by any exertion of the extensors. Mr. Hunter urged the patient to sit at intervals

LECTURE V. 238 Brodie, which I have mentioned in the first lecture of this year, seem satisfactorily to shew, that the transitions of colour, which are produced in the blood by respira- tion and circulation, are not of themselves alone adequate to occasion a change of tem- perature. I am at a loss to know what' chemists now think respecting heat, whe-. ther they consider it to be a distinct species of matter, or mere motion and vibration. Among the curious revolutions which this age has produced, those of chemical opini- ons have a fair claim to distinction. To shew which, I may mention, that a lady * on her first marriage, was wedded to that sci- entific champion who finally overthrew the dominion of phlogiston, and established in its stead the empire of caloric; and after his decease, on her second nuptials, was uni- ted to the man, who, vainly supposed he had subverted the rule of caloric, and re- stored the antient but long banished dy- nasty of motion and vibration. In this state of perplexity I cannot advance with * Madame Lavoisier, who afterwards married Count Rum ford.

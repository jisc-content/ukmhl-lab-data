LECTURE VI. one to supply the viscera and the rest of the body. Mr. Hunter says in his MS., “ there are two large nerves descending on either side of the oesophagus, and then uniting into one, forming a ganglion at their union, which he thinks serves the office of the sympathetic or visceral nerve, and the medulla spinalis.” In fish and reptiles, the nervous system approximates to that which is found in the higher classes of animals. In the former, it is extremely small. The brain and me- dulla spinalis of the squalus maximus, is exhibited in the Museum. It therefore ap- pears that fish, such agile, powerful, inde- fatigable creatures, which are also so sur- prizingly retentive of life, have not only a very languid circulation, scanty respi- ratory process, but also a disproportionately small nervous system. We need not in- deed marvel at such facts, because the ani- mals in which the energies of life seem greatest, are those in which neither circu- lating organs nor nerves are discoverable. s 4

If the iris had possessed the ordinary powers of muscles, and none else, it could not have remained, as it is known to do, permanently contracted in a strong light, and permanently dilated in a weak one. Indeed, an anatomist who is fond of tracing structure as connected with function, might readily persuade himself, that there is in the iris a distribution of arteries, similar to that which Mr. Carlisle has demonstrated in the limbs of sloths. We find, however, that sphincter muscles in general have the power of continuing their contraction, though no peculiar distribution of vessels is discoverable in them. In the gall blad- der, the function of which requires this slow but permanently acting irritability, in order to express its contents in small and equal quantities into the bowels, as the di- gested aliment passes into them, we discover

2G2 LECTURE VI. of animals, when they are sensible of light, sound, odour, and touch, the upper gan- glion which surrounds the oesophagus must be considered as the brain, and from this, nerves may be traced to the eyes, antennae, and feelers. Mr. Astley Cooper tells me, if the longitudinal nerve be divided in the earth-worm, it can no longer regulate its motions. When a worm is divided, each part moves and crawls by its own powers, but if the longitudinal nerve be divided, when the worm is entire, the motions of either end so counteract each other, that the animal cannot crawl, which shews that the volition of the worm proceeds from its brain, and cannot operate on the parts beyond the divided nerve. In insects and Crustacea, the nervous system is similar to that of worms. In molusca, there is no longitudinal source of nerves analogous to the medulla spinalis. There is an upper ganglion, si- milar to that considered as the brain in the animals just mentioned, and a lower

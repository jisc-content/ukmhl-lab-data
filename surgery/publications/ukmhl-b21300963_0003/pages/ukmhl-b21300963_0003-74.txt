58 LECTURE II. pose it to be confined in tubes, neither does the philosophy of the present time require such a supposition, for no one at present will doubt that a subtile substance may be attached to or inhere in a chord without mechanical confinement. Will not a wire when electrified continue to be so, if surrounded by non-conductors ? Expe- riments made on the limbs of animals with electricity, produced in the manner first explained by Volta, shew that different parts of the body have different conducting powers. Skin and membrane being very bad conductors, and brain, muscle, and blood being remarkably good ones. The celerity with which motions are transmitted from the tangible extremities of nerves most distant from the brain, and the celerity with which volition is trans- mitted to the muscles in consequence of sensations thus induced, are sufficient to convince us that such effects must be produced by the motions of a very mo- bile substance. It is not necessary to suppose that when such motions are trans-

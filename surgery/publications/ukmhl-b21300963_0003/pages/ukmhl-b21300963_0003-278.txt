I mention this merely as one of the proofs, though it is far from the best, of the uni- formity of the plan, and the diversity of the means and ends we observe in the construction of animals. The tail very commonly serves to animals the purposes of a switch, a balance, and a rudder. It is however a hold-fast in such as possess the cauda prehensilis, whilst to the kan- garoo it is a prop and a leaping-pole, and to the beaver it serves as a trowel.

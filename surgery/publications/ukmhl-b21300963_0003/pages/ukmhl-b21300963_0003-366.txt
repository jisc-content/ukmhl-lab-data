LECTURE V. C19A Mr. Hunter knew, that in cases of hae- morrhage, the arteries would gradually contract upon their diminished contents, to a much smaller calibre than common; and he measured their areas in the contract- ed state in which they were found in a horse that had been bled to death. He then distended them, so as to destroy the effect of this vital contraction ; and having suffer- ed them to regain that calibre which their elastic property naturally determines, he again measured their areas, and found that O the aorta had contracted in the first in- stance, to more than one-tenth of its natu- ral diameter, the iliac to one-sixth, and the crural to one-third. He also observed, that arteries corresponding to the radial of the human subject, and others of the same size, were closed. I also think it evident, in the common operations of surgery, that arteries of no inconsiderable magnitude, which have bled vehemently, and in a large stream immediately after their division, very speedily cease to bleed, and remain with their orifices so closed, that they are scarcely discernible. I have seen the radial and ulnar arteries of the human subject.

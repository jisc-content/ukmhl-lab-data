LECTURE II. 56 knee, it was the seat of the disorder. In like manner, persons who have had their limbs amputated, can scarcely believe that they are removed, because of the pain and other sensations they still seem to feel in them. In either of these cases, motions being excited in the middle of nerves, and transmitted to the brain, are attributed to a disordered state of those parts from which such motions have heretofore ori- ginated. If then it be admitted that sensation exists in the brain, and that volition pro- ceeds from that organ, it necessarily fol- lows that motions must be transmitted to and fro along the nervous chords, whenever they take place. It was formerly supposed that these chords were passive, and might be made mechanically to vibrate, but their want of elasticity and tension, and their pulpy origins and terminations, are circum- stances which render such a supposition inadmissible. Physiologists were there- fore led to conjecture that the nervous fibrils were tubular, and that they contained

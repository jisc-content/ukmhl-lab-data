( 46 ) LECTURE II. I proceed to speak of the structure and functions of the nervous fibres. The nerves which we observe pervading the body, appear to be packets of very minute threads, seemingly distinct from each other. The nerves divide and sub- divide, and in so doing a certain number of threads separate from the original packet, and appear as a distinct nerve. It is, there- fore, possible to trace a minute nerve, up to its origin, from the toe or finger, by splitting it off from the various packets with which it has been conjoined. So far does anatomical fact con cur with the physiological opinion, that every nervous filament com- municates distinctly with the brain or some process of that organ. This apparent continuity is, however, 12

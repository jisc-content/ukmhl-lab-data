LECTURE III. 122 is divided into the shoulder, which is composed of two bones ; the arm of one ; the fore-arm of two ; and the hand of many. The blade-bone of the shoulder is placed behind the chest, and not, as in brutes, by the side. It is in common so situated that the cup to which the arm is joined, and from which it hangs, projects exactly in the lateral direction, and consequently the weight of the arm has no tendency to move its socket forwards or backwards, but merely to depress it. Though the bones of the shoulder can be moved forwards and backwards, upwards and downwards, even in a considerable degree ; yet the joint of the shoulder can never approach to the breast bone as it does in quadrupeds. The effects resulting from these circumstances are, that when the arms hang in their na- tural direction, the general line of gravity of the upper part of the body undergoes no change; but if the shoulder joints be brought either forwards or backwards, the weight proportionately preponderates, and the whole body moves upon the base of the vertebral column. The extent of motion

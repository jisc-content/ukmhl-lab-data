140 LECTURE III. where feats of horsemanship are displayed. We there see a man stand with one foot on the saddle, and maintain his balance, when his horse is at full speed. This he does when his body is placed horizontally, and with one arm and leg extended in opposite directions. To maintain so perfect a ba- lance, it is necessary tljat the weight of the body should move in various directions, and with nicely adjusted gradations upon the head of the thigh bone, and also, that by the motions of the knee and ancle, the support should be equally varied under the incumbent weight. The weight of the body is transmitted from the arch of the pelvis, to a second arch made by the form of the heads and necks of the thigh bones, the basis of which rests against the side of the bone near its top, and protrudes that part of the bone outwards, and the bottom in a contrary â€¢ ^ direction, so as to bring the knee joint nearly under the general line of gravity of the whole body, and from this joint, the weight is transmitted in a perpendicular direction upon the arch of the foot.

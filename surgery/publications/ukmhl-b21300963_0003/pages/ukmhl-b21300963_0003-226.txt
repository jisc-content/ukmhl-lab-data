In proportion to the size and complexity of the brain, with reference to the size of the nervous system, do animals appear to possess various kinds and degrees of perception and intelli- gence. Camper and Hunter, at the same time, attended to the apparently descend- ing series in the construction of the heads of animals. The head of the African does really in some degree, and in some individuals more particularly, approximate in form to that of the monkev ; in the sloping direction of the forehead, the size and depth of the temporal fossa, in the flatness of the nose, the projection of the teeth, and the diminution of the chin.

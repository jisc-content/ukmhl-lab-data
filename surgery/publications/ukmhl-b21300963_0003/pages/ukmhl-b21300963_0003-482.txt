340 LECTURE VII. that, if occasionally I may have appeared to sermonize, I have quoted both the chapter and verse of my text from the Book of Na- ture. I address you, Gentlemen, as students of that great book, and earnestly exhort you to study it with such sentiments as I have endeavoured to inculcate. The conviction that evfery thing tends to some immediate or eventual good is the greatest incentive to its study. It was this conviction that excited Hunter to such continual enquiry, or invol- ved him occasionally in the depths and per- plexities of intense thought; for he was never satisfied without being able to assign an adequate reason for whatever he observed in the structure and economy of animals. This conviction makes the study of Nature highly interesting, and may indeed be said to render labour delightful, or to medicate the pains attendant on its toil. To those who entertain such sentiments as I have en- deavoured to inculcate, every thing seems animated, beneficent, and useful; they have the happy talent of discovering even « Tongues in the trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.”

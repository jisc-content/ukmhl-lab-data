LECTURE HI. 118 the top and bottom of a perpendicular pil- lar, but in the back it projects posteriorly, and describes a segment of a large circle. In consequence of this form, the back part of the chest, the blade bones of the shoul- der, and the weighty muscles of the back, project behind the center of gravity, and become equiponderant to the weight in front; and, we know, that in an upright posture, the whole weight of the upper part of the body is so perfectly balanced on the base of the vertebral column, as to have an equal propensity to preponderate in every direction. Though the motion taking place between the individual vertebrae is small, and such as can .produce no alteration in the form of the vertebral canal injurious to the me- dulla spinalis, yet the effect of the conjoin- ed motion of all the vertebrae is considera- ble ; and appears still greater when ob- served in the motions of the head, which it supports. We can incline the head far forwards, backwards, or to either side, and, nearly in an equal degree.

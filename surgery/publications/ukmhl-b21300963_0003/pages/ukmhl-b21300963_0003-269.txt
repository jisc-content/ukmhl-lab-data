The back part of the elbow in man, is formed into a smooth and somewhat triangular plain surface, upon which we occasionally lean. That na- ture designed this for an occasional resting place, is to be inferred from the coarse tex- ture of the skin which covers it, which is similar to that placed over the lower part of the knee pan. The form of the corresponding articular surfaces of the bone of the arm and ulna, freely admits an extensive motion forwards and backwards, and absolutely prevents any other.

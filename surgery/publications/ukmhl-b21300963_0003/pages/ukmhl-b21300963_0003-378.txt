To observe the circum- stances resulting from the conjoined actions of the heart and respiration, Mr. Hunter contrived a pair of bellows by which he * could maintain the latter process in an arti- ficial manner, and thus he was enabled to observe how greatly the heart’s action de- pends on its continuance. He says, “ the nearest dependence of the heart is upon the lungs,, for a stoppage of respiration pro- duces a stoppage of circulation; and a re- newal of the former is attended with a re- newal of the latter.

He says, “ that as the function of

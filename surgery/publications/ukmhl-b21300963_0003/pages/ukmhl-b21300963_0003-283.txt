141 LECTURE III. I must not dwell upon the form of the bones or the structure of the joints in these pelvic or lower extremities, lest I should set my audience asleep. Suffice it then to say, that when the knee-joint is extended, so that the leg makes a perpendicular line with the thigh, and the ankle bent, so that the foot forms a right angle with the leg, each of these joints is rigid and immove- able. Such is their position when we stand ; the whole limb forming a pillar for our support, and no motion can take place but at the top or bottom, at the hip or foot.

157 LECTURE IV. the vessels of plants should imbibe the law juices of the earth, however impregnated, and so suddenly convert them into sap, which is a very peculiar fluid ; for it seems a more wonderful kind of digestion than that which takes place even in the stomachs of animals. Here, however, the experi- ments of Mr. Knight seem to aid our con- ceptions, by shewing, that the returning vessels impregnate the plant with juices, which concrete, and are probably dissolved in the ascending watery sap, enriching it with nourishment, and it may be, chemi- cally aiding in its formation. Mr. Knight finds that the specific gravity of the wood of trees, is diminished by the ascent of the sap. Thus, when the genial warmth of the spring, excites those actions which imbibe the juices of the earth, and cause the ascent of the sap, the plant seems bursting with life and nutriment. The leaves bud in every part, and are formed with surprizing celerity. When, however, the tree has attained its full extent of an- nual growth, the returning sap is more especially employed in storing the inter-

Sometimes both kinds of organs are found in the same vegetable or animal, and sometimes the organs of each sex are allotted to dif- ferent individuals. How far the preroga- tive ol the female organs may extend with respect to their power of forming the rudi- ments or primordia of the embryon before the peculiar stimulus is applied which is said to fecundate the ovum, is probably unknown. The female organs of plants will, I believe, prepare a seed, though no fecundation has taken place. The progress of the formation of the young vegetable in the seeds of different plants is known to vary considerably. In the common bean, the plumula or first shoot is very evident, and even well formed. Experiments on ve- getables might tend to elucidate the extent of the powers allotted to the female organs. Frogs and fish prepare and exclude their membranaceous ova prior to fecundation ; and some degree of organization is discover- able in that part which would produce the

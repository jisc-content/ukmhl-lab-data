That part of the ulna which is next the radius, for so the other bone of the fore-arm is called, is hol- lowed out into a semicircular cavity, in %/ which the radius revolves to a certain degree. The top of the radius is formed into a shallow cup, which fits on to a convexity of much greater extent of surface in the bone of the arm. There- fore, the cup can move forwards and back- wards, in correspondence with the motions of the ulna, and can also, in any state of flexion or extension of the joint, turn round upon its own axis. The radius has also a semicircular convex surface, which is lodged in the excavation of the ulna, and at the same time revolves in that cavity to a cer- tain degree. Such is the mechanism by which we are enabled in any state of flexion and extension of the elbow, to turn the 4

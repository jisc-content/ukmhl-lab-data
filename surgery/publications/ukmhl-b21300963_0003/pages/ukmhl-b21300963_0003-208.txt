Though blood is so subtile a fluid as to be capable of permeating the minutest vessels of the body, yet that part which spontaneously coagulates, becomes very firm, tough, and unsoluble; often also assuming a fibrous appearance. From the exact similarity of these fibres to those of which muscles are chiefly composed, which Mr. Hunter has taken great pains to exhibit in preparations you will observe in the Museum, he inferred their identity ; an in- ference which modern chemistry has since established. With respect to animals, Mr. Hunter observes in M. S. 1776, â€œ In the more imperfect animals, it is very probable that there are no fixed parts, but that all parts are irritable and have motion, like the urinary bladder or an intestine. As animals become complicated, and have various motions, especially the progressive, then such motions are more divided or par- tial ; for which purpose it is necessary there should be substances whose firmness and

LECTURE V. 201 to a certain extent, published his own ac- count of his deeds and designs. The first editor of the European Magazine, printed in 1782, was well acquainted with Doctor Hunter and his brother, and being desirous of giving, in that work, an account of the distinguished schools of science both at home and abroad, he began with the lec- tures of these brothers. That the account and anecdotes of Mr. Hunter are genuine, the editor has given me the most positive assurance, adding, I received the materials from his own hand. Here John Hunter speaks for himself, but is made to tell his story with simplicity and effect, by the friendly aid of the then editor * of the ma- gazine. That Mr. Hunter acquired the best physiological knowledge of the time from his brotherâ€™s lectures cannot be doubt- * Mr. Perry, now editor of the Morning Chronicle, who superintended the publication of the European Ma- gazine at its commencement, though but for a very short time. I have annexed his account of Mr. Hunter, to this publication, because it is brief, and it must, I think, be interesting to all to be informed what were the inten- tions and objects of Mr. Hunter, in his lectures and labours.

He knew that parts, in which no muscular structure was evident, were nevertheless irritable, and that the modes of contraction and relaxation of muscular parts were va- rious. He seems by no means satisfied, that all the phenomena of muscular relaxa- tion can be accounted for, on the supposi- tion of the abatement or cessation of an ac- tive power.

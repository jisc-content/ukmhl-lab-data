The cuticle which seems a compact, though thin sub- stance, through which the water effused beneath it, when we are blistered, does not even transude, appears well calculated for this purpose. It is most exactly fitted to the surface of the true skin, descending into every groove, and rising over every emi- nence. Yet however neatly fitted this wa- ter-proof garment may be, it would be liable to be wrinkled or displaced by fric- tion, were it not firmly connected to the skin by a net-work of very minute, soft, and seemingly mucaginous fibres, which are therefore denominated the rete mucosumu This part is variously coloured in different persons; it is tawny in some, freckled in others, and black in the African. These investments of the skin do not appear to be sensible, and doubts have been entertained whether they are in any degree vascular. We must however, I think, admit that vessels arrive at the surface of the cuticle.

lecture I. 27 Mr. Hunter was the first physiologist who placed in clear array the various vital functions before our view, so as to enable us to judge of their nature and probable cause. He told us that life was a great chemist, and even in a seemingly quiescent state, had the power of 'resisting the operation of external chemical agency, and thereby preventing the decomposition of those bodies in which it resided. Thus seeds may lie buried far beneath the surface of the earth for a great length of time with- out decaying, but being thrown up, they veoetate. Mr. Hunter shewed us that this & chemist, Life, had the power of regulating the temperature of the substances in which it resides. Seeds possessing the principle of life being placed within the influence of the atmosphere, and in contact with mois- ture, produce heat, form sugar to edulcorate the first nutriment of the young plant, and in short, bring about all those phenomena which characterize incipient vegetation. He further shewed us, that Life, by its che- mical processes, could convert a great va- riety of dissimilar substances, into one kind

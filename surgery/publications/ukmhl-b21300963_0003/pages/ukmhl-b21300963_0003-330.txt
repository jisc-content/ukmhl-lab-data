188 LECTURE IV. animal or vegetable substances partook of the nature of such substances, and if dried and burned, emitted the same odour, and produced similar results to those which occur from the decomposition of the same substances before they have undergone such solution. Nay, he told us further, that the chyle formed from animal matter rapidly putrified, whilst that prepared from vege- tables was slow in undergoing a similar change. As an abundance of nitrogene seems to be the base of animal substances, so its disposition to combine with hydro- gene, and to form ammonia, seems readily to break up the general bond of union of the parts forming the compound. Whilst engaged in examining the chyle, he also ex- amined the lymph which the absorbent ves- sels contain, and his chemical friends, who were men of great knowledge and ability re- port, that it is in all respects like the blood, except that it wants the globular particles and colour of that fluid, a proof that these vessels, as well as others, modify their con- tents, which is a physiological subject, I shall subsequently have to discuss.

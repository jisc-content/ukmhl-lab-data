I shew you this preparation, and you see these caeca in their natural situation, from which they are removed in the other specimens. I beg leave also to mention, that being desirous to ascertain how far the distributive vessels of the lower kinds of animals admitted of being injected from their digestive cavities, as is the case in medusae, and also to observe, whether any transudation took place through their sides, I requested Mr. Clift to inflate and inject with subtile liquors, the digestive organs in echini, insects, and vermes ; and as far as his enquiries have yet extended, he finds the canal similar to that of the higher classes, neither air, nor injection im- pelled, escapes from it, either through its sides, or by proceeding into vessels.

LECTURE VI. t 2 a, series of connected ganglia, each supply- ing the portion of the body to which it cor- responds ; and even in quadrupeds we some- times observe the medulla spinalis to swell out in portions, so as to appear like a series of connected ganglia, as is evident in the preparation which Mr. Hunter has exhibited of that part in the lion. The experiments of M. Le Gallois, shew that the nervous influence of portions of the body, corres- ponds with that part of the medulla spina- lis to which their nerves are connected ; that it forms a kind of center from which nervous actions radiate, and to which they tend. Yet according to the view I have exhibited of the nervous functions in the introductory lectures, it appears necessary that such actions should be transmitted to and from the brain in order to commu- nicate sensation and volition. M. Le Gallois, seems, however, to sup- pose, that sensation continues in the me- dulla spinalis after the brain is removed. Now were I to entertain the same opinion, I might be led on to suppose that a duck

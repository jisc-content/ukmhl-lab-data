lecture V. 235 j Oil the surface of the body are beset with numerous valves, or flood-gates, which pre- vent the blood from moving in a retro- grade course, and oblige it to go onwards towards the heart. The blood sometimes returns to the heart, chiefly by the deep- seated veins which accompany correspond- ing contiguous arteries, and at others more abundantly through those on the surface. Mr. Hunter believed that veins possessed vital activity, but it must be of the kind allotted to the muscles of tardigrade ani- mals, and such as various parts of our .bodies are also endowed with. Indeed the large veins near the heart are said to evince an irritability of the more common kind. The nature of the irritability of veins may en- able "them to adapt their calibre to their contents. Mr. Hunter argues that, as the vena portas in the liver performs the func- tion of an artery, it probably is irritable. We know that it fails to secrete, or secretes with profusion ; that sometimes it prepares healthy, and at others faulty, bile, which va- riation of function can scarcely be supposed to take place in a perfectly passive vessel. 7

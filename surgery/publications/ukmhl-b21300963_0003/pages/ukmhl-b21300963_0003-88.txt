72 LECTURE II. that may be made to Haller’s opinion of' irritability being independent on sensibility, I have only to remark, that the effects of pressure made on nerves, as well as other observations, have induced the general be- lief that some fluid or energy pervades the nerves for the supply of the body. Pres- sure on a nerve benumbs and paralyzes the parts which it supplies, which regain sensa- tion and motion on the removal of the pressure ; yet if irritability exists in vege- tables and some animals that have no ner- vous system, it shews the possibility of irritability being produced without the in- tervention of nerves. It has been my object to shew that Mr. Hunter’s Theory of Life is a verifiable Theory, and that it affords the most ra- tional explanation of the phenomena of irritability, and of those nervous functions that have been considered. It is, how- ever, impossible in the compass of a lec- ture, as I have before observed, to review all the phsenomena of the nervous func- tions, which it is necessary to do in order

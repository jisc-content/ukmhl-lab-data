They are to the Surgeon what the first principles of the mathematics are to the practical geometrician, without the knowledge of which a man can nei- ther be a philosopher nor a Surgeon. In our re- search after diseases, says Mr. Hunter, we ought not only to understand the case, which becomes the immediate object of Surgery, such as in- flammation, suppuration, mortification, &c. but also the cause of the effect; for without this knowledge our practice must be very confined, very precarious, and often applied too late. This knowledge opens to the surgeon varieties of treatment.

60 LECTURE II. The opinion that sensation is the con- sequence of an action begun in and transmitted through the nervous fibrils, assists us in understanding how our sen- sations may be very vivid from the slightest impulses ; such, for instance, as take place in the application of odour to the olfactory nerves, for it is not the im- pulse, but the consequent action, that is transmitted to the sensorium : and why we may have no sensation from the most vio- lent impulses ; for such we cannot but sup- pose to occur, when a man is shot through the body, or has a limb removed by a can- non-ball; occurrences which have, however, happened without any distinct feeling inti- mating the event. In supposing a principle of life in nerves, similar to what is conceived to exist in muscles, we might naturally expect to find certain analogies of functions in those organs. The facility, celerity, and accu- racy of the nervous actions, seem like those of the muscles to be improved by use ; as is exemplified in the quick and correct per-

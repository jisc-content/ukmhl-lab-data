Doctor Macartney, who has of late particularly attended to this subject, gives it as his opinion, “ that when fluids change their composition, it is often by some vital action in themselves, instead of a fermenta- tive process, or the mechanical operation of solids upon them, as is commonly sup- posed.”* Were irritability shewn to be an electrical phenomenon, and I consider it al- ready demonstrated that they are electri- cal actions which cause the various combi- nations and decompositions so constantly occurring in all parts of living bodies, and upon which their formation and functions so greatly depend; yet the consideration of the vital phenomena proves that such electrical operations are under the influence and control of the vital powers. I am aware that there is an obscurity in my first lectures, arising from my not explicitly de- claring my sentiments ; which did not then appear necessary, and even now may per- haps be deemed presumptuous and impro- per.

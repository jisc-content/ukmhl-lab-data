As the exterior ligaments are unyielding, this variation of form in the central pivot could-never have taken place, had not an elastic substance intervened between them. It is interesting and creditable to human intellect, which thus penetrates into the de- signs of nature, to know, that in the great fish, the squalus maximus, or basking shark of Pennant, this, then merely suppositious, structure is actually found. There is in the centre of the intervertebral connection, a bag of water, and so great is the elasticity ol the substance by which it is surrounded, that when Mr. Clift cut into the bag, the expansion of the elastic matter, projected the fluid to the height of four feet in a

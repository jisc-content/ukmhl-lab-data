Were it so, the contents of that cavity would be continually gravitating towards its inferior aperture. Even the pelvic viscera cannot be said to gravitate towards the inferior aperture of the pelvis, in the ordinary posi- tions of the body ; whatever presses in that direction must be protruded. The weight of the whole upper part of the body, is transmitted from the arch de- scribed by the bones of the pelvis, to a se- cond arch, made by the form of the heads and necks of the thigh bones. Their heads, which are very perfectly rounded, making a considerable portion of a sphere, are lodged in deep cups, the brims of which are particularly high in the upper and outer part, where the re-action of the ground against our descending weight, would ordi- narily tend to dislodge them, had not such an occurrence been thus guarded against. These cups are placed a little in front ol a perpendicular line let fall from the top of the sacrum. As the weight of the greater

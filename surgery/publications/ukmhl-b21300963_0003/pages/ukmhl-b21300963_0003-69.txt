Microscopical observers also tell us, that though the nervous fibrils in each packet appear distinct, and may be separated from each other in the manner already described, yet they have nevertheless transverse com- munications with each other. Each ner- vous fibre has been supposed to be covered by investing membranes similar to those of the brain ; but this opinion is founded on an analogy with what is observed in the optic nerve, rather than on actual obser- vation with respect to others. That they have investing membranes is clear, and we are told that we may dissolve the medullary or nervous matter by an alkali, and leave these investing membranes ; or on the other hand, that we may dissolve the in- vesting membranes by nitric acid, and leave the medullary fibres. Having thus spoken of the chief cir-

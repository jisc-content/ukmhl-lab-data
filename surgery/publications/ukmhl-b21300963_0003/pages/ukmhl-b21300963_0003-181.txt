39 LECTURE I. d 4 tures which I have had the honor of deliver- ing in this theatre, when speaking of the ultimate fibres of the body, I observed that they varied in the properties of rigidity, pli- ability, strength, and elasticity; and that such properties could not be considered to be dependent on the quantity of matter contained in the fibres, which would be estimable by weight, to which such pro- perties bear no proportionate relation ; and consequently, that these properties must be attributed to certain powers of attrac- tion and repulsion operating in various modes and degrees, between the atoms of which such fibres are composed. How- ever minute the atoms may be which com- pose those visible and tangible substances we call matter, Sir Humphry Daveyâ€™s ex- periments shew, that each atom is sur- rounded by electric substances possessing powers of attraction and repulsion ; and which substances are not only capable of acting upon the integral parts of bodies, but also upon the largest masses of matter. These electric substances produce decom- position and recombination, and by such

Late observations induce the belief, that even light may be incorporated in a latent state with animal substances, and after- wards elicited by a kind of spontaneous separation, by vital actions, or by causes that seem to act mechanically on the sub- stance in which it inheres. * All the late discoveries in science seem to realize the speculations of ancient philosophers, and shew that all the changes and motions which occur in surrounding bodies, as well as in those which live, are the effect of subtile and invisible principles existing in them, or acting on them. * See Dr. Hulmc’s, and Dr. Macartney’s papers in the Philosophical Transactions.

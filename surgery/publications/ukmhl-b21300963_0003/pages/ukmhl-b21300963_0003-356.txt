Lyonnet, Cuvier and others, assert that the dorsal vessel found in insects, gives off no branches, and that no motion of fluids can be perceived in them, even by the aid of the microscope. Professor Cuvier says, « tout le corps est nourri par une fluide stagnant.” Yet even vessels can produce a free and forcible motion of their contents, as is evident in vegetables, and in the ab- sorbents of the higher classes of animals. If there were no current in the fluids of insects, how could liquors run so freely as they are known to do from the contorted tubes that form their glands? Professor Cuvier is disposed to consider the irrita- bility of animals as greatly dependant on the aeration of the blood; and ascribes the vivacity and power of insects to its great exposure to air. Yet this opinion cannot, I think, be maintained as a general inference in physiology ; for what animals are more agile, powerful, and indefati- gable than fish, and yet we have reason to believe their blood is very imperfectly aerated ?

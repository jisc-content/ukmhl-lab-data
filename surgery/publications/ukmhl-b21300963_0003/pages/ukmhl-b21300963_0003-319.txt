LECTURE IV. 177 the administration of arsenic was uniformly followed by profuse secretion of mucus and watery liquors into the stomach, divides the nerves of the eighth pair in dogs, and then administers the poison, but no secre- tions are afterwards effused into the sto- mach. * Professor Harwood of Cambridge gives to two dogs, equal in age, health, and ap- petite, equal quantities of flesh meat. They were pointers, and he suffers one of the dogs to do what nature indicated to be fa- vourable to digestion, to lie down by the fire and go to sleep ; but he entices the other into the fields, and causes him to hunt about for game. After some hours he kills both dogs, and finds the food in the stomach of the dog which had been kept in constant exercise, undigested and but little changed; whilst in the other it had, in the same time, not only been di- gested by the stomach, but converted into chyle by the intestines, and was rapidly passing through their absorbent vessels * Philos.

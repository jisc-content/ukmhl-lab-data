LECTURE r. 34 the most part presents itself to our notice, and is cognizable by the eye and touch, we know that it has a property called by Sir Isaac Newton vis inertia, an indisposition to move unless impelled to motion, and a disposition to continue in motion unless re- tarded. There are some philosophers who think, that properties similar to those of the ag- gregate mass, likewise belong to every atom of which it is composed; whilst others, on the contrary, think, that the atoms have very different qualities, and that the vis inertia is the property only of the aggregate mass. The matter of animals and vegetables is, however, an aggregate mass ; it is as we ex- press it, common matter, it is inert; so that the necessity of supposing the superad- dition of some subtile and mobile substance is apparent. Taking it for granted that the opinions generally entertained concerning the cause of electrical motions are true, analogy would induce us to suppose, that similar motions might be produced, by similar

GL POSTSCRIPT. to the Royal College ol Surgeons, I began my lectures, for reasons which 1 have lully enlarged. He maintains the assertion that the mind, like the body, is imbecile in youth as well as decrepit in age. Now that the processes and evidences of mind should be enfeebled and disturbed by corresponding states of the nervous system would be naturally expected ; but that, under other circumstances, any evident differ- ence in the intellectual functions is observable, is an assertion which will, I believe, on examination, be found to be incorrect. Children are highly susceptible and prone to con- tinual action. They are vividly affected by every im- pression, most of which also produce on them an effect which novelty gives to subjects even in adult life. Youth is the season for acquiring knowledge: reflection would but retard its attainment, and would be unavailing from deficiency of facts and experience. That the mind is often wayward and irrational in youth as well as in age, is apparent; but that it exhibits as powerful intellect when excited and when it possesses adequate means for its exertion in childhood, as at any period of life, must, I believe, be acknowledged on a full examination of the subject; which has been admirably displayed by the writings of Miss Edgeworth. That children also pos- sess the more energetic qualities of mind, those which chiefly characterize its distinct and superior nature, in as great a degree as at any period of life, will not, I think, be denied by any who/has carefully attended to then conduct. \et surgeons possess particular oppor- tunities ol making such remarks, and the communica- tion of instances, which are not to them very uncommon, may be useful in the general consideration of this sub-

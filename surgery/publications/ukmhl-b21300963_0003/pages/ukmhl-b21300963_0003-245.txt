LECTURE II. 103 h 4 extended scale, solicitously enquiring into all those particulars which adapt these animals to the peculiar situation they occupy in the scale of existence. The horizontal direction of the tail, so different from that of fish, and the cause of the pe- culiar strength of the flexor muscles, ana- logous, as he says, to the lumbar muscles of animals, is shewn to be calculated to raise the most prominent part of the ani- mal, where the blow-hole is placed, above the surface of the water for respiration; whilst the horizontal motions of the tail are equally adapted to depress it to the depths of the ocean in search of food. The motions of the tail cause these animals to move up and down in a curvilinear di- rection, which makes them appear hump- backed, and thus the dolphin is generally represented. We see this in porpoises when they swim slowly and near shore, alternately respiring and grubbing along the bottom. Yet these creatures can, with their powerful tails, scull themselves forwards in a strait direction with surprizing speed, passing a ship whilst she is going at the rate of ten

r ( 108 ) LECTURE III. . The head is placed on the top of a column of bones, which, from their having in ge- neral a kind of turning motion on one another, are called vertebra*, and the whole pile is called the vertebral column. The base of the column rests upon a wedge- shaped bone, interposed between the side-bones of the pelvis. Each vertebra has belonging to it, a part called its body, which is of an oval or circular form, and presents two plain surfaces to the bone above and below, which are cemented to- gether by the intervertebral substance. The bodies of the vertebrae appear in front of the pillar, laid one upon another, like the stones with which a column is erected. They chiefly support the weight of the head and trunk, and regularly and consi- derably increase in size, as they descend, because the weight is proportionately aug- menting.

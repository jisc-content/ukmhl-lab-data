LECTURE III. 113 or backwards, or any turning of one verte- bra upon another ; a form which allows only of a motion from side to side, to which, however, the ribs present an insur- mountable obstacle. In the back, we find the spinous processes sloping considerably downwards, and absolutely locked together, by a sharp ridge of one being received into a groove of the other. We find, also, the rib connected to the transverse processes, so that every circumstance concurs to pre- vent any motion, save that which results from the elasticity of the intervertebral substance. It seems, therefore*, evidently the intention of nature, to make the verte- bral column, in the back, a fixed support for the ribs to move upon. In the loins, we find the articular pro- cesses very differently formed from what they are either in the neck or back. The descending ones are shaped like half an oval, the convex surface of which is re- ceived into a cavity of corresponding figure in those which ascend, which form is admi- rably adapted to admit of the suddenly i

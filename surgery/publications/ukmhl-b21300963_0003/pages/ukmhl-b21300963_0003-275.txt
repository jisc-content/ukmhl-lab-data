The second joint of the thumb resembles the first joint of the fingers, not only in the form of the bones, but also in the arrangement of the liga- ments, which limit the motions nearly to those of a hinge, and the last joint of the thumb, is like either of the two last joints of the fingers, a perfect hinge. The fingers and thumb are of unequal length, and, on this account, they are pe- culiarly adapted for grasping spherical bo- dies, which are most difficult to seize and to hold. If, for instance, we take hold of a pocket globe, placing one of its poles in the hollow of our hand, we find all our fingers and the thumb opposing each other upon some parallel of latitude, and thus giving the greatest security to our grasp. When the elbow joint is fixed, the hand describes a complete semicircle, in prona- tion and supination ; and the extent of its motion, in these directions, may be in- creased by variations in the position of the k 3

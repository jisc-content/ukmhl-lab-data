These animalcules are found in the na- tural cavities, or in those formed in conse- quence of disease, in the bodies of other animals. We meet with them in the abdo- men, in bursae mucosae, and in cysts in the brain, liver, and other organs. The form of one species is a globular or oval bag which has an undulatory motion when put into tepid water. The bag contains a transparent fluid. Young hydatids form upon the bag, are detached when very small, float about in the liquor of the cavities in which they dwell, to grow and to multiply as their parents have done. Now in a phy- siological point of view* we must consider hydatids to be nourished by absorption from without, or suppose the bag to be a digesting cavity, though no aperture is dis- cernible. In the department of the Museum allotted to display the structure of the di- gestive organs, Mr. Hunter has first put up some hydatids, as if to mark the uncer-

LECTURE VI. 256 I have been induced thus briefly to ad- vert to the functions of the kidney, because the quantity and quality of its products can be ascertained, and thus throw light upon the subject of secretion in general. When water abounds in the blood, whether from more being imbibed from the diges- tive organs, or less being carried off from the surfaces of our bodies, the quantity separated by the kidney is proportionately increased, and vice versa. Thus do the se- cretions become vicarious to one another, and conjointly tend to maintain the proper quantity and quality of the circulating fluids. The qualities of the urine also demon- strate how much secretion is affected by different states of the nervous system in general. When the kidney is rendered irritable from various causes, and persons are in that state usually termed hysterical, the kidney scarcely separates any thing but water from the blood, which is, indeed, produced in an inordinate quantity; and it is probable, that a different state of the nervous system, may render the kidney

LECTURE ill. k 2 LSI into rounded heads, and the first bones of the fingersâ€˜have cup-shaped corresponding ca- a ities, so that considering the skeleton merely, we might suppose the joint was one of the ball and socket kind, admitting of motion in all directions. We find however, that the ligaments are so arranged as to limit the motions of the joints chiefly to those of flexion and extension, allowing in- deed of slight motion from side to side, and a slight horizontal turning of the fin- gei on die end ol the metacarpal bone, which motions are greatest in the fore and little fingers. The articular surface of this convex end of the metacarpal bones con- tinues so far backwards and forwards, that we can extend the fingers a little beyond a light line with the metacarpus, and we can bend them to more than a right angle. Ihe metacarpal bones are so connected by ligaments and muscles, as to prevent these ends separating from on e another, andspread- mg, when we grasp convex bodies ; and the end of the metacarpal bone, which supports the little finger, has a powerful apparatus of muscles expressly allotted to it, to keep

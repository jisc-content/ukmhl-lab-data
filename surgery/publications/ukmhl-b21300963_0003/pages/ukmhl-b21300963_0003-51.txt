35 LECTURE I. d 2 causes, in matter organized as it is found to be in the vegetable and animal systems. The phasnomena of electricity and of life correspond. Electricity may be attached to, or inhere, in a wire ; it may be sudden- ly dissipated, or have its powers annulled, or it may be removed by degrees or in por- tions, and the wire may remain less and less strongly electrified, in proportion as it is abstracted. So life inheres in vegetables and animals ; it may sometimes be sudden- ly dissipated, or have its powers abolished, though in general it is lost by degrees, with- out any apparent change taking place in the structure; and in either case putrefaction begins when life terminates. The motions of electricity are charac- terized by their celerity and force; so are the motions of irritability. The motions of electricity are vibratory; so likewise are those of irritability. When by long con- tinued exertion the power of muscles is fa- tigued, or when it is feeble, their vibratory or tremulous motions are manifest to com-

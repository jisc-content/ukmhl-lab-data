LECTURE VI. Mr. Hunter next displays the weapons and instruments which Nature has allotted to animals ; and here we find exhibited the spurs of the cock, the retractile nails of the cat kind, which must be considered as wea- pons ; whilst the fixt nails of other kinds of animals may be regarded as instru- ments, with which they scratch or burrow. The hoof of the horse is shewn, for it is used as a weapon. The horns ot animals, being displayed elsewhere, are not included, in this department of the Museum. The teeth seem to have been considered by Mr. Hunter chiefly as weapons and in- struments. Though teeth do not usually grow, yet those in the front ot the mouth of the animals, now called rodentia, are con- tinually growing, so that they project and prevent the animal from masticating, it not worn down by gnawing, according to the intention of nature. The venom bags, and tubular teeth, or fangs of serpents, by which the wound is inflicted and the poison in- jected, are shewn, and also the stings ot scorpions, bees, and wasps.

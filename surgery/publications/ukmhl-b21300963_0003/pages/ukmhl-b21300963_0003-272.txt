We find the same structure in the second apparent joint of the fore-legs of quadrupeds. What seems a knee is the wrist, and they kneel upon the knuckle of the carpus. The fabric of this part is particularly strong. Its arched form secures it from injury from above, the carpal ligament from below; but it * is equally uninjured by forces applied to its side, else how could boxers strike with such force, or animals leap as they are known to do. The four metacarpal bones, which are interposed between the carpus and fin- gers, are made large at either end, to form joints, and small in the middle, to affoid room and arrangement to muscles, which move the fingers from side to side. Iheir bulky ends, which join on to the carpus, are connected by nearly plain surfaces, and admit of no manifest motion. The other ends, which support the fingers, are formed

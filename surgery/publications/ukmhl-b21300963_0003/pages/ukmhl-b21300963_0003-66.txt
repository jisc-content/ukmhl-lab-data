The vital organs are required to carry on their functions with a degree of regularity and order, under the varying circumstances of life; and the possession of a distinct nerve may enable them to continue their functions without so materially participat- ing in the disturbances of the animal sys- tem, as they must otherwise have done: yet the numerous connections of the vis- ceral with the animal nerves must render both participators in each otherâ€™s disorders. The nerves then, may be said to proceed from the brain, medulla spinalis, and vis- ceral nerve, to all parts of the body for their supply. In thus expressing a fact, however, we should guard against an idea which the analogous distribution of arteries is apt to engender.

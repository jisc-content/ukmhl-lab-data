LECTURE I. 10 knowledge. In 1782, Mr. Hunter says, his Museum “ had already cost him 10,000/. besides the labour required in making the preparations. Of this sum more than 2000/. had been expended in the purchase of dead animals only.”* Opportunities of examining; rare and curious animals were also liberally afforded to him, chiefly through the means of that zealous patron and promoter of science, Sir Joseph Banks; towards whom, he always felt and expres- sed the warmest friendship and gratitude. Mr. Hunter knew but little of the arbi- trary arrangements of natural history. The simplicity of his object induced an equal simplicity of arrangement. The facts are displayed in his Museum, according to the order of the vital processes, which is the method also adopted by Professor Cuvier. I repeat what I asserted in the intro- ductory lectures, that the preparations in the Museum are records of facts. Mr. ♦European Magazine for 1782.

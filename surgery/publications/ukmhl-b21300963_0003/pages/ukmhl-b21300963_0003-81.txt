65 LECTURE II. So intimate, indeed, is the connection as to impose on us the opinion of their identity. The body springs and bounds as though its inert fabric were alive ; yet have we good reasons for believing that life is distinct from organization. The mind and the actions of life affect each other. Failure or disturbance of the ac- tions of life prevent or disturb our feel- ings, and enfeeble, perplex, or distract our intellectual operations. The mind equally affects the actions of life, and thus influ- ences the whole body. Terror seems to palsy all its parts, whilst contrary emotions cause the limbs to struggle, and become contracted from energy. Now though these facts may countenance the idea of the identity of mind and life, yet have we good reasons for believing that they are perfectly distinct. Whilst, therefore, on the one hand, I feel interested in oppugn- ing those physiological opinions whTch tend to confound life with organization â€¢ I would, on the other, equally oppose those which confound perception and intelli- gence with mere vitality.

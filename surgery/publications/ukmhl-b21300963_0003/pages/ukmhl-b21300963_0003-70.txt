LECTURE 1L 54 cumstances relating to the anatomy of the nervous system, I shall not dwell on this part of the subject, but hasten to the principal object of the lecture, to consider its Physiology, in order to examine how far Mr. Hunterâ€™s Theory of Life, seems adequate to explain the phenomena of the nervous functions. First then, it is generally believed that all sensation is in. the brain, and that all volition proceeds from that organ. This proposition requiring to be impressed so as to produce conviction, for it is the founda- tion on which all our future reasoning is founded, I shall state the principal causes of this opinion. First, If the continuity of of a nerve be intercepted at any point be- tween that extremity which receives im- pressions from the objects of sense, and which therefore may be called the impres- sible or tangible extremity, and that which communicates with the brain, and is usually called its sensorial extremity, both feeling and volition by means of that nerve are suspended.

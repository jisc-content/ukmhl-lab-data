Now, if the first joint be a ball and socket, and the second a hinge, it is manifest that the hand may be put in almost every possible position within the area of that space, the circum- ference of which it is competent to describe by its utmost extent of motion. There are, however, two bones in the fore-arm; and one of them alone has its motions restricted to those of a hinge. This is called the ulna, and is the bone which sends backwards a projection, we name the elbow. The top of the elbow gives a surface for the attach- ment of the tendinous fibres of the extensor muscle, and affords a lever to increase its power. The lever in the human subject, is, however,inconsiderable, compared with what we observe in animals, the power of whose progressive motions greatly depends on the drawing backward of this part. We observe this in our dogs, and horses, and other ani- mals; and it forms the first apparent joint

LECTURE V. 223 part suddenly cracked, and the external elastic matter of the vessel readily yielding, it became distended by the effused injec- tion, into a bulky, but irregular, form. Mr. Hunter thought that the great quan- tity of elastic matter which surrounds large arteries, was well calculated to prevent that injury to the vessels which the powerful propulsion of blood by the heart might otherwise occasion. Nay, he observed that the quantity of elastic matter was greatest where it appeared most wanted, that it was greater on the convex part of the arch of the aorta than on the concave. He further observed that certain arteries which are occa- sionally much elongated, have a far greater share of elasticity in their longitudinal direc- tion than others. The quantity of elastic mat- ter surrounding arteries also gradually dimi- nishes as these tubes recede from the heart, and the impulse of that organ diminishes; which well known fact corroborates the opi- nions I have just mentioned. The elasticity of the large arteries may also lighten the labour of the heart by the kind of suction it may sometimes occasion.

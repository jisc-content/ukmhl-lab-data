LECTURE III. 114- turning horizontal motion which takes place in this part of the vertebral column. It also freely admits of motion from side to side, but does not allow of it in any considerable degree either forwards or back- wards. Indeed had such motions been permitted beyond a certain extent, the ab- dominal viscerawould have been injuriously compressed by the ribs. Neither is much motion, in this direction, requisite, because we can carry forwards and backwards the trunk of the body, by moving the pelvis upon the rounded heads of the thigh bones. The spinous processes of the loins extend horizontally, so as not to interfere with one another in the turning motion, but their great breadth is prohibitory of extension beyond a limited degree. The head is joined on to the first verte- bra, (which, from supporting this globe on its shoulders, is generally called the atlas,) by two oval processes placed obliquely and received into corresponding cavities in the upper articular processes of this vertebra. The form of the bones precludes any hori-

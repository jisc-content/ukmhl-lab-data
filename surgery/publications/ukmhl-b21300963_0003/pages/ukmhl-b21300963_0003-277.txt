LECTURE III. 135 / in equilibrio on the bone which supports the base of the vertebral column. This wedge-shaped bone is called the os sacrum they say, because that part of the animal was frequently offered in sacrifices. It is very broad above and narrow below, so that the weight which it supports would only tend to depress the broader part of the wedge in- to the narrower space, and render the fabric more secure. The sacrum is convex be- hind, and concave in front, for it forms a part of a somewhat circular bony cavity placed at the bottom of the belly and called the pelvis or basin. The sacrum terminates by a smooth surface of small extent, and oblong in the lateral direction, on which there moves backwards and for- wards a little bone which is called the os coccygis, from its supposed resemblance to a cuckowâ€™s beak. This bone is occasionally thrust backwards, but is usually held for- wards by muscles connected to it, and af- fords the last bony support for the weight of those bowels which may gravitate into the cavity of the pelvis in particular posi- tions of the body. k 4

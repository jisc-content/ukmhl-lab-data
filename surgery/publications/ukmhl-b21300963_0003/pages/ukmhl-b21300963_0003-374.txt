LECTURE V. 232 He then divided the mesentery at the edge next the intestine, where the vessels being larger, the water ran rapidly from them; and when he opened a vessel of consider- able size, it gushed from it with the same velocity and force that blood issues from the same sized vessel when divided in a living animal. I refer you to this experiment, be- cause it seems far better calculated to dis- play the effects likely to result from the circumstances we observe in the distribution and ramification of arteries, than any we may make with tubes of our own construction. Mr. Hunter was convinced that arteries terminate in veins, for if we inject the for- mer with any subtile fluid, it quickly and freely returns by the latter. I know not, however, whether the magnitude of some of the communicating tubes was ascertained till of late years. I have in my possession a hand which was injected with wax about thirty years ago, and the wax passed freely from the arteries into the veins, so as to afford a beautiful exhibition of the network of small veins, which proceed to terminate

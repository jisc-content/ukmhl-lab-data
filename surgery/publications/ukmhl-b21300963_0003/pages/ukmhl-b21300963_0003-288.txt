Thus standing, all the other limbs are free to move, and can be moved with great power, because they are connected to a perpendicular column which owes its stabi- lity to its great weight. In the sculptured figures of the ancients, if a man is represen- ted standing on one leg, he seems as firmly fixed to the ground as a fast-rooted tree ; and associating freedom and power of mo- tion with this stability, we seem to expect the continuance of that action, which the figure is represented to have begun. When we stand upon both legs, we can transfer the weight from one to the other, with very little variation in the position of our bodies. The oblique direction of the thigh bones, the consequent approximation of the knees, and the transmission of the weight, in a perpendicular direction on the arch of the foot, seems to me designed to give us this facility. In progression, the supporting limb

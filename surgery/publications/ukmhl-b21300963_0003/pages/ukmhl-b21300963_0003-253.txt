LECTURE III. Ill large and. perpendicular stream, compress- ing the bag into a small compass, and forcing its sides into numerous wrinkles. Behind the body of each vertebra there is a bony ring, and these rings, when op- posed to one another, constitute a canal for the protection and transmission of that important part, the medulla spinalis. From these rings, seven processes are con- tinued, four of which serve to make joints, connecting the vertebrae with one another. There are two ascending and two descend- ing articular processes. Two processes also stand out laterally, and are called transverse, and one backwards, which, be- ing in general pointed, is named spinous. These latter processes chiefly serve to give attachment to the muscles which support and move the vertebral column. Upon the form of the articular processes, the degree and kind of motion which takes place between the several vertebrae, seem entirely to depend. In the neck, the op- posing surfaces of the articular processes ii

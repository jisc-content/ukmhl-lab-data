LECTURE I. 32 Brodie.* As the circulation of the blood will continue in warm as well as in cold blooded animals without the influence of the brain, provided respiration be artificially kept up in the former by means of a pair of bellows, Mr. Brodie severed the connection of the brain from the top of the medulla spinalis, which in effect instantly kills the animal, and thereby prevents further suffering in the experiment, and then maintained ar- tificial respiration, and consequent cir- culation, for more than two hours. Yet under these circumstances the body cooled as rapidly and regularly as that of another animal in whom respiration and circu- lation ceased upon the division of the medulla spinalis. This experiment shews that the change produced by respiration on the blood is not of itself alone sufficient to maintain the ordinary temperature of ani- mals. Chemical science has not yet explain- ed how the intense heat and light are pro- duced, which are occasioned by the transit * Philosophical Transactions, 1811. Cromian Lecture.

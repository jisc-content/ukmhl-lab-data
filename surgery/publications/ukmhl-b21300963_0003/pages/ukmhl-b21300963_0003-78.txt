If this theory of nervous actions could be proved, the extent of our knowledge would onljK lead to this conclusion, that motions of a subtile substance, propagated to and fro in the nervous fibrils, take place in consequence of excitement by impulses and volition ; but from such motions, it seems impossible to account for sensation or volition.

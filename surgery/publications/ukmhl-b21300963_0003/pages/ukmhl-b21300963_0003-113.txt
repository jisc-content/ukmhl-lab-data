Ill may therefore be said to be nervous, and parts may thus perish without struggle or reaction; without inflammatory processes, or with so trivial a degree of them as could not by itself destroy vitality. To support these opinions by additional evidence, I would direct your attention to what happens in a disordered state of the stomach. Are not its feelings and functions disordered ? By feelings, I do not mean those of actual pain; there may be in- quietude without the patientâ€™s observing it> though, in general, uncomfortable sensa- tions are remarked, particularly if the attention be excited to them. In such a disordered condition of the stomach, are not the secretions deficient or vitiated : and is it not, therefore, incompetent to perform its functions ? We now know, for of late it has been demonstrated, that secre- tion is regulated by the nervous energies.

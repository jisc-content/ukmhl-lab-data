In the various kinds of fruits, a great quantity of esculent matter is produced, which must be considered as' designed for the food of animals. In the accomplishment of this object, we again observe an extreme diversity of means ; sometimes the seeds are contained in the center of the fruit ; and sometimes set in the circumference, or surface. Sometimes the little embryon of the young plant, with the esculent substance, is included in a firm case. In those plants, which thrive every where, the seeds are light, and scat- tered abroad by the air; and some are curiously feathered to prolong their flight, whilst others, adapted to peculiar situations, are heavy.

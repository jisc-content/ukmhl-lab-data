59 LECTURE II. mitted along the nervous chords, an evident motion of the visible matter of those chords should be induced. Electrical motions take place along a wire without occasioning any visible motion of the metal itself. Formerly, it was thought that the mo- tions of the nerves that cause sensation, were the effect of an impulse made on their tangible extremities, which was pro- pagated along the chord to the brain. It seems to be an improvement in modern physiology, to attribute sensation to an action begun in the nervous fibrils, in con- sequence of the stimulation which they suf- fer from such impulses. This opinion is contended for by Dr. Darwin, in his paper on ocular Spectra, published in the Phi- losophical Transactions; and Sir Everard Home has further shewn, that the living principle of nerves has an irritability be- longing to it, resembling that of muscles, and capable of causing a contraction in them when they arq divided.* * Croonian Lecture.

Now you know, Gentlemen, that some physiologists suppose the velocity of the current of blood to be equal in all sets of vessels. With respect to this subject, I will merely refer you to an experiment of Hales, in his Hasmastatics. Having estimated the probable force of the heart, he put a tube into the aorta of a dead dog, and kept it filled with water to a height which would give an equal propulsion to the supposed power of the heart. Under these circum- stances, having opened the abdomen, he cut along the tube of the intestines, at that part most remote from the mesentery, and observed the water running tardily from the orifices of the divided arteries.

LECTURE II. 5% This general and imperfect sketch of the anatomy of the nervous system, re~ lates only to what may be discovered by our unassisted sight. If by means of the mi- croscope we endeavour to observe the ulti- mate nervous fibres, persons in general are as much at a loss as when by the same means they attempt to trace the ultimate muscular fibres. Those fibres which we can split off from a nervous packet, in the manner be- fore mentioned, though too minute to ad- mit of further subdivision, appear by the microscope to be themselves packets of smaller threads. It is generally asserted by microscopical observers, that the nerves and medullary matter of the brain and spi- nal marrow are the same, and are com- posed of very minute fibres. Fontana speaks confidently on this point ; and he further says, that he has seen these ner- vous fibres regenerated in the medium which has been formed to unite a divided nerve. He describes the nervous fibres in every part of the nervous system as cylin-

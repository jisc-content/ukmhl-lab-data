69 LECTURE II. F 3 marks, it is curious, that insects, having an external articulated skeleton, possess such a combination of motive powers, that some of them walk, run, leap, swim, and fly with as much facility, as beasts, birds, and fish, exercise one or more of these faculties. Professor Cuvier thinks that they are indebt- ed for these advantages, to the numerous articulations which their case or skeleton possesses. It might strike a person who had not considered the subject, that there were animals possessing both an internal and ex- ternal skeleton, as those of the reptile tribe* The muscles of insects, however, act upon the external case, which is therefore similar to the skeleton. The shells of tortoises are to be considered merely as armour, as defences against injuries, which the animals have neither the power to oppose, nor agi- lity to avoid. Even amongst the higher order of quadrupeds, some wear this kind of armour, as the rhinoceros ; and many have such thick hides, as protect their pos- sessors from trivial injuries ; hides like the leathern doublet of Hudibras, which “ Though not ball, was cudgel proof.”

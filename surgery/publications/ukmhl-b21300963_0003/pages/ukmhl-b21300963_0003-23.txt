LECTURE I. 7 B 4 I he term theory, in philosophical lan- guage, like hypothesis, denotes the most plausible and rational mode of accounting for certain phenomena, the causes of which have not been fully developed. In apply- ing these terms to medical and physiologi- cal subjects, I may be allowed to define what I think they designate, and what I intend to convey by them. By the word theory I mean a rational explanation of the cause or connexion of an apparently full or sufficient series of facts: by hypothesis, a rational conjecture concerning subjects in which the series of facts is obviously incom- plete. The formation of an hypothesis excites us to enquiries, which may either confirm or confute our conjectures; and which may. by enabling us to discover the deficient facts, convert our hypothesis into a theory. Believing the facts collected by the ingenui ty and industry of Mr. Hunter, to be suffi- cient to establish his opinions respecting ife, I have therefore called them a theory.

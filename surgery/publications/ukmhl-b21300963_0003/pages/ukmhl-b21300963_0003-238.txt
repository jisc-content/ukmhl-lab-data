96 LECTURE II. to the degree and direction in which the force has been applied. If, therefore, I push a bullet contained in a tube, in a hori- zontal direction, I infer that it moves for the same reason, or from the same kind of cause. But if I put the tube in an oblique or perpendicular direction, I find the bullet move with different degrees of velocity and force from another cause, gravitation. If I explode gunpowder in the lower part of a tube held in a perpendicular direction, con- taining also a bullet, I find the ball forced upwards for a time by one cause, and then it descends in consequence of another. My senses may indeed inform me of the ap- pearances of light and shade, in the sur- faces of spherical and many-sided figures; but if, after having studied all that human ingenuity and industry has discovered rela- tive to these subjects, I am able, in the absence of the object, to represent upon paper a spherical or many-sided figure, do I not manifest a knowledge of the causes of light and shade beyond that which my perceptions alone would have produced ? If also, I can at will present the angle of a /

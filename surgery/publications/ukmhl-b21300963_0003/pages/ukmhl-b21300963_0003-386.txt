' It is curious to observe Mr. Hunter’s expressions with regard to these agents. u I would not,” says he, “ call them arteries; they are workers, they are the labourers.” He would not consider them as concerned in the circulation of the blood, they are the chemists and the archi- tects of the body. That such vessels could separate from the blood something that was formally present in that fluid, might be easily credited. But how they could pre- pare that extreme diversity of fluids and substances which they are known to do, formed a problem that was never solved till the time of Hunter. He thought that the vital principle of the vessel, acting on that of its fluid contents, produced these che- mical changes. He thought that theie was a correspondence or concert of affection and action between them, a harmony as he calls it. Thus did he attempt to explain how a morbid state of fluids could induce an un- healthy action of vessels, and how the latter could reciprocally occasion the former.

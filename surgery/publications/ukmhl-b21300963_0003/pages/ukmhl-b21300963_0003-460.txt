It Is from the consideration of the means by which the continuance of the different species of animals is ensured, that we de- rive the firmest conviction of the works ot Nature being neither the effect of necessi- ty, nor of chance ; and therefore it follows that they must be the effect of causes and laws inscrutable by man. The young ol some animals are born with very perfect senses and powers, so that they scarcely need maternal care. Yet as young ani- mals cannot have experience, and must be exposed to danger from their deficiency of size and strength, the mother generally nurses them, and directs their conduct, till they are able to procure their own sus- tenance, and secure or defend themselves.

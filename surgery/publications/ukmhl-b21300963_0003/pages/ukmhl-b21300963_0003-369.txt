When the blood is projected by that pow- erful engine, the heart, into the large arte- ries, little energy on their part is requisite to urge on the rapid current; but in pro- portion as the heart’s influence diminishes, power is allotted to the vessels to aid in its propulsion. There are some modern physio- logists, and those of high repute, who con- sider the heart, by its actions alone, as fully adequate to maintain the circulation, and consequently discredit the irritability of arte- ries, except of those which are called capil- laries. But where, I would ask, am I to sup- pose that these capillaries begin ? I cannot observe the sudden and deep blush of shame, or extreme paleness of terror, without being convinced that arteries of no inconsiderable size possess vital activity; we cannot believe that the heart’s influence can be partially

Hairs, feathers, scales, and horny cuticle, resemble each other in this particu- lar, and also in their chemical analysis. Mr. Hunter has shewn the analogy of the formation of feathers and hairs. Each is formed by a vascular substance, which ascends to some distance up their shafts. Hairs are bulbous rooted, and the stronger ones are more deeply implanted in the skin. The capsule of the bulb, which is tough and shining, being opened, is found to contain a very vascular pulp which can be injected, and ascends up the shaft of the hair so as successively to form it at the bottom ; and thus to increase its length. I cannot suppose this circumstance was commonly known at the time Mr. Hunter made these preparations, for a knowledge of this fact much diminishes our surprise at the ac- counts we have received of the plica polo- nica, in which disease the hairs are said to be ill-formed, matted, and to bleed from their roots.

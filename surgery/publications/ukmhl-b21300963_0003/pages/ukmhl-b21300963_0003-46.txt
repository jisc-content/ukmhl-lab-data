Having thus briefly described the prin- cipal phenomena of muscular action, for I forbear to notice others of less importance, I proceed to review the conjectures that have been formed as to the cause of these ' curious, sudden, and powerful contractions. Not to speak of exploded hypotheses, I trouble you only with those which are mo- dern. First, then, the contraction has been sup- posed to be the effect of some chemical change occurring in the part. This opinion is I think invalidated by the reiterated con- tractions which may be produced in the limbs of some animals when removed from the body, even during twenty-four hours, if excited by voltaic electricity, and conse- quently when no supply of materials can be supposed to exist within the limb, to produce such reiterated chemical changes.

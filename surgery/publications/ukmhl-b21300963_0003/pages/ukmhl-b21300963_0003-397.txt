LECTURE VI. 255 powers of converting various kinds ol ani- mal matter into a peculiar and very soluble substance, lately recognized and denomi- nated urea. So soluble is it that we may evaporate the water of the urine to a con- siderable degree without precipitating the urea; and when we add large quantities of water to urine, the urea will pervade the whole, and be dissolved in it, so as to be distinguishable in every portion by appro- priate tests. Lime removed from our bones or taken into the circulating vessels with our food, becomes also dissolved in the water of the urine by means of phosphoric acid, which the human kidney prepares in so large a proportion, that the superfluous acid will redden the vegetable blue, and dissolve more lime than is usually found in urine. That the phosphoric, acid could not exist formally in the blood, but is pre- pared in the secretory vessels of the kidney, must be evident to every one on consider- ation. Yet in herbivorous animals, who take into the circulation a great deal of flint with their food, the urine is rendered alka- line in order to dissolve that kind of earth.

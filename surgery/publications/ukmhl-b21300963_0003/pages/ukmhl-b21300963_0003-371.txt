How am I to account for the distinct pulsation we often perceive in the carotid, or abdominal aorta, unless some vital activity be admitted to exist even in the larger vessels ? We may indeed, in some instances, account for the phe- nomena which we observe, by supposing constriction to have occurred in the capil- laries of the large pulsating trunk ; but this supposition appears to me very inadequate to explain the whole of the phenomena of such occurrences. â€¢ Our physiological theories should be ade- quate to account for all the vital pheno- mena, both in health and disorder, or they never can be maintained as good theories. Mr. Hunter enquired if the area of ar- teries increased as they receded from the heart, and for this purpose examined the trunk of the common carotid, which runs to some distance without giving off any branch of importance.

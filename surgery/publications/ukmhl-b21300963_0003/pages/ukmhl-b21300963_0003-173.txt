LECTURE I. 31 Mr. Ellis, who with such great industry and intelligence has collated all the scat- tered evidences relative to the production of heat in living bodies, and added so much to the collected knowledge, seems to think that all the phenomena of the vari- ations of temperature in them, may be ac- counted for by known chemical processes. Here, however, I must observe, that Mr. Hunterâ€™s opinion of life having the power of regulating temperature was deduced, not only from his experiments related in the Philosophical Transactions, but also from observing, that in certain affections of the stomach, the heat of the body is subject to great vicissitudes, whilst respiration and circulation remain unaltered; and also that parts of the body are subject to similar variations, which appear inexplicable upon any other supposition than that of local nervous excitement or torpor, or some similar affections of the vital powers of the part which undergoes such transitions. His views with respect to this subject are con- firmed by the late experiments of Mr.

LECTURE 111. 112 are smooth and oblique planes, a form which admits of a limited and equal degree of sliding motion forwards and backwards, from side to side, and also of a turning or vertebral motion of one bone on another. We know that the vertebral column in the neck, admits of an equal motion in these different directions, so that we can touch the breast with. our chins, the back with our hind head, and the shoulders with either ear. We can also turn the neck, so as to describe with our face a complete semicircle. In the last motion, the effect is, however, augmented by the peculiar turning of the first vertebra upon the second, which will be separately described hereafter. In the neck we find the spinous processes short and horizontal, so as to afford no obstacle to the extension of that part, and we find them formed in a similar manner, in all animals which have long necks and carry their heads far backwards. In the back, we find the articular pro- cesses formed into perpendicular planes, which preclude any motion either forwaids

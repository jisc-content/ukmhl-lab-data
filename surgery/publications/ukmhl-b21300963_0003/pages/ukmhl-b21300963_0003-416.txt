274 LECTURE VI. The long continuance of life, when the brain is removed in tortoises, the dissec- tions of that organ by Doctors Gall and Spurzheim, the late experiments of Le Gallois and Dr. Wilson Phillip, shewing that the vital functions can be carried on in warm as well as in cold blooded ani- mals, after the brain has been removed, provided, indeed, artificial respiration be kept up in the former class, all tend to shew, what comparative anatomy also teaches, that the brain is not essential to the vital functions. There are animals which have no brains, and in proportion as they possess them, so do they appear to have sensation, volition, and other faculties. Every portion of newly acquired know- ledge only corroborates the already well established opinion, that sensation, voli- tion, and the intellectual faculties are con- nected with the brain alone. The experiments of M. Le Gallois shew that there is an analogy in the functions ol the medulla spinalis in the higher and lower classes ol animals. In the latter, it is

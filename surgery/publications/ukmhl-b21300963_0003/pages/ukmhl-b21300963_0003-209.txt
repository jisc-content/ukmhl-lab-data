LECTURE II. Gr/ structure, and mode of connection, should divide and determine the motions to parti- cular parts. These structures are differently placed in different animals. In the earth- worm, caterpillar, and nereis, the firm structure is the skin, which is divided into rings, all of which have motion on each other, and into these are muscles inserted, so that a variety of particular motions is produced. In insects, spiders, and lobsters, whose firm parts are more complicated and answer a greater variety of purposes, we find the fixed parts still more dense. In the two former they are of a horny, and in the latter of a calcareous nature. These parts also make a covering for the animal, but there are processes of them going deep for the attachment of muscles. In tor- toises, lizards, snakes, &c. though they have firm, external coverings, yet there is an in- ternal apparatus for motion, which is prin- cipally bone. In the more perfect animals, external firm parts are rarely found. They have an internal osseous skeleton, so that the muscles and their attachments are re- versed ; and thus we find them arranged f 2

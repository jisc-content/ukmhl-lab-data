1.50 LECTURE III. one can observe the figure without at once perceiving, that it is far better calculated for cleansing the Augean stables, than for catching the stag of CEnoe. Many of the bones which compose the skeleton are connected together without admitting of motion upon one another ; and in this case, portions of elastic gristle are interposed between them to prevent jarring, and they are tied together by un- yielding and exceedingly strong ligaments. When bones move upon one another, when a true joint is formed, the corresponding surfaces of each bone are covered by gristle, which is exquisitely smooth or polished. Between these smooth surfaces, a liquor, like white of egg, is effused to prevent their adhesion, and to facilitate their motion. The escape of this synovial liquid from the joint is prevented by capsules ; and the bones are firmly tied together by ligaments of surprizing strength, which are so con- trived as freely to admit those motions that the bones are adapted for, and to prevent any other. All the parts composing a joint

108 growths are formed, such as had no exist- ence in the original compages of the body. When such morbid growths occur in the dif- ferent organs of the body, their apparent bulk becomes enlarged; but their natural struc- ture and functions are diminished, and may ultimately be destroyed. As we find the same sorts and varieties of growths, taking place from the same causes in the midst of the common tissue, that con- nects the -various parts of the body, I was led to speak of Tumours, though, b}^ this means, it became necessary to consider se- veral diseases, which might, perhaps, with more propriety have been reserved, for dis- cussion at a future period. Here, however, the natural connexions of subjects were so \ strong, that no artificial concatenation, ap- peared so well adapted to fulfil the chief ob- ject of arrangement, that of preserving and displaying every fact relating to the subject.

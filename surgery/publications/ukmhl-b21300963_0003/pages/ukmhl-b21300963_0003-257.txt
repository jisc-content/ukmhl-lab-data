The condyles are placed so exactly parallel to the center of gravity, that when we sit upright, and go to sleep in that posture, the weight of the head has a tendency to preponderate equally in every direction, as we see in ? those who are dozing in a carriage. Nay, their heads sometimes revolve in a circle, like the head of Harlequin on the stage. The head and atlas turn round upon the second vertebra; the upper articular pro- cesses of which, as well as the lower ones of the atlas, are formed into nearly hori- zontal planes, a form well calculated to admit of this motion. They are not, in- deed, perfectly horizontal, but shelve a little to either side, so as to admit of a part of the lateral motion formerly mentioned. The second vertebra has growing up from its body a tooth-shaped process, and it is, therefore, usually called the vertebra den- tata. This process is tied to the head by ligaments of surprizing strength, which i 2 \

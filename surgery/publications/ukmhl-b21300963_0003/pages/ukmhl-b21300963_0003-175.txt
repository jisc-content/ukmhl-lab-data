LECTURE I. 33 of electricity through the air. That the powers of life regulate electrical actions is evident ; and may they not in this manner produce some of those variations of tem- perature to which I have just referred? But admitting that the refined operations of modern chemistry should actually shew us the means by which the variations of temperature are in every instance pro- duced, they would not explain the cause of those actions by which such means are rendered efficient; which actions constitute the essential difference between living and dead bodies. Neither would chemical science, by ex- plaining the regulation of temperature, un- fold the cause of the other vital phceno- mena; for instance, the prevention of pu- trefaction and irritability. The heat of in- cubation would hurry on the putrefaction of a dead egg, but the white and yolk of a living one, which we cannot suppose to be organized, do not putrify, though they un- dergo changes subservient to the nutrition oi the young animal they are designed to D

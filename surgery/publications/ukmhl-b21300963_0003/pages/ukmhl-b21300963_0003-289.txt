LECTURE III. 147 l 2 should be perpendicularly under the center of gravity of the whole body, and the ad- vancing one is not brought forwards in a straight but curvilinear direction. This course is the result of the rolling of the head of the thigh bone in its socket, and by it the advancing limb is brought forwards without striking the other, and carried to a position in which it is more di- rectly under the center of gravity of the bo- dy, when that is also brought forwards, than it would have been, had the limb moved in a straight line. The free and firm step of the soldier is the result of the circumstances I have mentioned. We are more struck and convinced of this, by observing that carica- ture of marching which is exhibited by opera dancers on the stage, for these sen- try will raise the advancing limb above a horizontal line drawn from the front of the pelvis, and performing sundry evolutions with the foot, will afterwards gently deposit it where it ought to be placed in ordinary progression : afterwards throwing the weight of the body perpendicularly upon it, they exhibit the same extravagancies with the

LECTURE VII. 338 philosophers. But the party I allude to are not real sceptios, and their professions and conduct form a curious example of a vis inertia ; for after resolving not to think on certain subjects, they argumentatively en- deavour to prevent others from thinking ; whilst on the one side they reject a very few propositions, merely because they are defi- cient in a kind of proof that the subject does not allow of, and that cannot be rationally required ; on the other, they admit a hos, of absurdities, apparently without examin- ation. Therefore, upon the very grounds of their own doubt, they marshall and exercise pernicious and discordant opinions, drawn from every possible and remote source, with which they assail the opinions of others, that at least may be said to be innocent and use- ful, but which also confer a dignity on human nature, and excite us to generous and honorable actions. I feel it to be m} duty, Gentlemen, to prevent, if possible, the banners of physiology from being pur- loined and carried into such a service ; and yours not to suffer those of our profession in general, to appear in so disgracetul and mischievous a contest.

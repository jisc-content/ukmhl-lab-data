The original development of the bones is not faulty ; hut dis- placement of these with change in form, more especially affecting their articular surfaces, is gradually ef- fected, by a predominance of action in certain muscles ; such predomi- nance being dependent either on spasm of those which so act, or on want of action in those which ought to be their antagonists. There is no actual dislocation of the tarsal bones ; there is merely gradual change in their relative conforma- tion and positions. A case is related by Delpech which well illustrates the mode of production. A soldier had the " external popliteal nerve injured by a shotthe peronei, the tibialis anticus, and the extensor muscles, became paralytic in consequence; and from the unopposed action of the opponents of these muscles, club-foot resulted.* There are varieties of Talipes. I. Talipes Equinus.—The muscles of the calf are contracted; the tendo AchiUis is rigid ; the patient steps on the extremities of the meta- tarsal bones, without bringing the heel to the ground; the foot is in other respects well formed; with the exception of the toes, which are curled up by flexion of the distal and extension of the proximal phalanges. This, as a simple form of Talipes, rarely occurs congenitally, but usually appears in childhood during the period of dentition. IL Talijjes Varus.—This is the most common variety ; consisting of extension, adduction, and rotation of the foot—the rotation being analo- gous to supination of the hand. The muscles of the calf and the adduc- tors of the foot are contracted; the heel is drawn up; the toes turn * Little. Introduction, p. 35. Fig. 363.

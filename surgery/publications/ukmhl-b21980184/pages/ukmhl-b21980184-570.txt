536 MODE OF UNION. indeed, may bo termed Nature's splint; wliereby tlie parts are kept in close and undisturbed contact, until their real consolidation shall have been completecl When this has been achieved by the delinitive callus, all necessity for the presence of provisional callus lias gone by; and consequently it is soon thereafter removed by absorption. At the same time, absorption is also busy with the temporary change of structure in the soft parts ; restoring these nearly, or altogether, to their normal state. The repair in the main structure having been completed, the exterior scaffolding by whose help that repair had been effected is taken away. And thus not only is the bone firmly and truly reunited; its symmetry and usefulness are also restored. This gradual change Ls seldom com- Fig. 213. Fig. 214.

At a, though there is still some preternatural density, contiiuiity of texture is almost coni]ilctoly restored. At b, where coaptation has not been so acciu'ate, absorption is busy in accomplishing the same end ; the projecting dense laminso being gradually convi^rlod into cancellous texture. Fig. 215.

AFFECTIONS OF THE GUMS. 782 Recession of the Gums.

In the senile cases, hut little can he done hy remedial treatment; the occurrence is only a part of the general decay, and is in all respects to he regarded as such, A. similar result may follow the accumulation of tartar ; and then it is to he averted by removal of the offending matter. Congestion of the gums may induce it; and this cause is met by local abstraction of blood—by leeches or scarification—and by the subsequent use of a.stringent denti- frices.

151 AMPUTATION IN GANGRENE. a Hue of demarcation. Wlien it is clironic and dry, dependent on an internal cause only, or on internal more than on external causes, and con- nected with failure of both general and local power, we wait for the lino of demarcation, watch the i)rogress of separation—cautiously supporting the system meanwhile—and when detachment is far advanced, we inter- fere merely to facilitate and modify its completion; we amputate in the line of separation. When gangrene is the result of one particular ex- ternal cause, cold, we await the line of demarcation; and, so soon as that has been fairly formed, we amputate either there, or above, according as cii'cumstances may seem to require. To these rules there are occasional exceptions. Sometimes, in a spreading acute gangrene, for example, it may be prudent to await the line of demarcation. And sometimes, in chronic gangrene, it may be expedient to amputate independently of this. Such exceptions are only occasional, however; and, as usual, do not fail to strengthen the general rule.

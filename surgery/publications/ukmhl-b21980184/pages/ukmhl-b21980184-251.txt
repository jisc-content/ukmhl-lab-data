217 THE TOURNIQUET, of the limb. Or Siguoroui's compressor may be employed. By either of these metliods, pressure is confined to two points ; and the evil conse- quences of uniform constriction of the whole limb are avoided. The mechanical contrivance is inferior to the living fingers in one particular; it is more apt to slip, and thus to endanger considerable loss of blood ere re-adjustment can be effected. But it has one equally obvious advantage. How- ever tedious the manipulations of the wound may prove, requiring long continuance of temporary pressure above, it is not liable to become unsteady or wavering from cramp or fatigue. The most common expedient for in- directly and temporarily restraining hemor- rhage, is the Tourniquet; a circular band, whereby the whole circumference of the limb is constricted ; tightened by a screw, which at the same time forces down a compress or pad upon the vessel's track with a special inten- Fig. 91.

807 ANEURISM IN THE SITUATION OF THE TONSIL. Anmn'sm in the Siination of the Tonsil. Tlie internal carotid artery, where it lies bellind the toiisil, may be- come the site of an aneurisnial development, and tlio sac may project towards the phai'ynx. In such circumstances it is liable to bo mistaken for an abscess. An example of this disease occurred under the care of Mr. Symo in 1842,* in a lady about sixty years of age. The tumour had ex- isted for six months, and during that period had gradually increased in size so as to occupy the fauces and interfere with deglutition. The common carotid was tied below the crossing of the omohyoid, but the patient dying from an intercurrent attack of diarrhoea, an opportunity was afforded for the examination of the disease. The aneurism was found to occupy the internal carotid from its junction with the common trunk, to just below its entrance into the carotid canal; the aperture of communication corresponded to the middle of the vessel, was half an inch in length, and was a crevice through the inner coats of the artery. The sac was formed of the outer coat, which was so dilated as to give to the course of the vessel a sigmoid direction. The contents of the sac were coagulated, except in a narrow channel corresponding Avith the cuiTont through the artery. Malignant Disease of the Tonsils. Cancerous idceration may extend to the tonsil from the tongue ; or may orignate in the gland itself. The latter event is rare. Carcinomatous or medullary tumour may occupy the tonsil, as a pri- mary disease; but more frequently such enlargement of this part is but an extension of malignant disease from the lip or lymphatic gland. All such affections are incurable ; and operative interference is out of the questionâ€”unless, indeed, at an advanced period of the case tem- porary relief by bronchotomy be deemed advisable, on account of im- pending asphyxia. * Contributions to the Pathology and Practice of Sui'gcvy, 1848.

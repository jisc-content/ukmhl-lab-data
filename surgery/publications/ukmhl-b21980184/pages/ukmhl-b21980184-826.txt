792 ANCHYLOSIS OF THE JAW. Anchylosis of the Jaw. This may be spurious or real; the result of change in the soft parts or in the hard. Mastication, deglutition, and speech, are seriously inter- fered with; and the patient anxiously seeks relief. Tliis may be afforded by the Imife alone, when cicatrices are in fault; dividing adhesions, and preventing reunion by careful dressing subsequently. Sometimes, in addition, subcutaneous section of the masseter is advisable. When rigidity is extreme, and depends on true anchylosis, wliich is extremely rare, it may be necessary to operate on the jaw itself in order to prevent death from inanition; cutting through the neck of the bone on both sides, so as to malce a false joint; or removing a central portion entirely, for the admission of food; or fracturing the bone by the use of two screw wedges, by which the jaws may be forcibly separated.

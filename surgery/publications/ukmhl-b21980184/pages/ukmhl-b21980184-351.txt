RICKETS. 317 osteoid tissue, aiid bone, will be found irregularly mingled together. Cancellous cavities, consequently, largely predominate ; containing a sub- stance of a brown, or reddish hue, soft, comi^ressible, gelatinous, cartilagi- nous, fibrous, or even sometimes serous; Avhile in some cases a sanious liquid may be squeezed out, as if from wet leather. The whole bone is soft, easily cut with a knife, and, while the articular ends are preter- naturally flexible, the shafts are liable to suffer deformation from incom- plete fracture taking place within the periosteum which remains intact (Virchow). While such bones are chiefly defective in the regular development of their earthy elements, the animal matter too is changed ; for the extract obtained by boiling does not yield either chondrin or the gelatine of bone. Besides all this, comparative arrest of growth takes place ; as is seen especially in the lower limbs. Sometimes the entire bone is expanded, even to a great extent; the calvarium, for example, being in some cases found of more than double its usual thickness, and seeming to consist almost entirely of diploe. Fig. 131. Fig. 132. Sometimes, on the contrary, atrophy is the prominent change. In all cases, whether atrophy or expansion exist, the bone will be found much lighter than in the normal state. The flat bones are, perhaps, more frequently thickened than otherwise; the long bones, usually, are shortened in the shaft, while they shew enlargement and flattening out of the articulating extremities. Such enlargement, however, is often l^igs. 131 and 132. Permanent rai-vature of the spine, with rotation, produced oy nckets.

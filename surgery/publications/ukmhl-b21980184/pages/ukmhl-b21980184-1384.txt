The outer longitu- dinal line, which is somewhat posterior, is next marked, eight inches distant from the former, and parallel to it. These two lines are then Pig. 373. joined by a transverse line of the same extent, which falls upon the upper border of the patella, or upon some lower portion of this bone. The short flap is indicated by a transverse line passing behind the thigh, the length of this flap being one-fourth that of the long one ; or, assum- Pig. 374. ing the circumference of the limb to be sixteen inches, and the length of the long flap eight inches, the length of the short flap is two inches.

210 NATURAL HEMOSTATICS. Arterial Hemorrhage.—When an artery is cut across, bleeding is instant and rapid ; tlie blood of a florid red colour; and ejected not in a continuous stream, but yer salium. The arterial orifice remaining open, and the energy of the heart's impulse being unbroken, much blood is lost in a very short time, from a vessel of any considerable size ; and, cceieris pcmhics, the nearer the wound to the centre of circulation, the more rapid the hemorrhage. In recent wounds, such bleeding is their most pro- minent and alarming circumstance; the first to claim attention with a view to its arrest. The means suitable for this end are termed Hemo- statics ; and are of two lands ; the work of Nature ; and the work of the surgeon. Natural Hemostatics. These, also, are divisible into two classes ; Temporary and Permanent. I. The Tempoi^ary. 1. The artery, so soon as severed, retracts, in virtue of its elastic nature, within its sheath; leaving the extreme portion of that sheath, which does not retract—being without the same elasticity— vacant, and of rough surface. In that vacant space, coagulation occurs. Particles of fibrin become entangled and adherent to the rough points of Fig. 83. Plan of natural hemostatics, in a cut artery. At a, tlie cut end of the arterial tube ; conical, by contraction. At b, the arterial sheath, vacated by the re- tracted artery, and occupied by coagulated blood. At c, the coaguluni projecting from the orifice of the sheath.—Jones. Fig. 84.

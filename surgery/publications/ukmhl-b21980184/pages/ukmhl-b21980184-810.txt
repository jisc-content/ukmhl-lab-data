77G ULCERATION AND EXFOLIATION OF THE PALATE. of bone, aiid sometimes cicatricial adhesion of the soft jialate, so as ty shut oIT the buccal from the nasal portion of the pharynx. In such cases the syphilitic affection has reached the tertiary stage, and the em- ployment of iodide of potassium, iodide of iron, tonics, etc., constitutes an important part of our constitutional treatment; the local applications must vary, according to tlie characters of the sore; nitrate of silver nitric acid, and liquor chlorinei, being most generally ai)plicable. Exfoliation of the hard palate, necessarily accompanied with ulcera- tion of the corresponding mucous membrane, is very common in debili- tated subjects suffering from the advanced stages of syphilis, and has very frequently been attributed quite as mucb to the poisonous elfects of mercury employed for the cure of the earlier symptoms, as to the syphilis itself. In such cases mercurials are certainly quite unwarrantable, but iodine, in some form, will be found invaluable, while cod-liver oil is very usefuL Locally, separation is patiently awaited ; and, when this has been completed, removal of tbe sequestrum is effected, if necessary. As tbe whole tbiclmess of bone usually perishes, an aperture of communi- cation necessarily results between the nasal and buccal cavities. If this be large, and spontaneous cicatricial contraction does not occur, after waiting for a period sufficient to admit of its spontaneously narrowing to the utmost, the deficiency may be supplied by a mechanical contrivance j but gutta percba, wax, or tow plugs, made by the surgeon or patient, sbould not be employed, as they tend to dilate the opening. Should it resemble a merely fistulous apertiu^e, closure of the mucous membrane may be obtained by the occasional application of a iieated wixe.

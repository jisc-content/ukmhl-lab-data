TUMOURS OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 269 bulk, position, and tendency to blood. But, wliile tlio otliers seldom if ever degenerate into the medullary or other malignant formation, this is prone to do so. Early removal is therefore expedient. If the neck be unusually narrow, the shape being more pyriform than is its wont, either evulsion or deligation may be employed. But, in the majority of cases, excision is demanded ; it being most expedient that no remnant of the morbid structure should be left behind, lest reproduction ensue. And in order to effect this thorough removal, preliminary incisions, perhaps severe, are requisite in certain situations; as will afterwards be shewn. This variety of polypus occurs most frequently in the nostrils, and in the uterus; sometimes in the pharynx, rectum, and vagina. 4. The Medullary Polypus may be a degeneration of the fibrous ; or of original formation. Most frequently it is the latter. Occasionally it is associated with the sijnple form. I have seen the front nares filled with ordinary mucous polypi, while a large malignant tumour hung down into the throat. It follows the usual course ; and, when original, no hope of cure need be entertained. Its most frequent sites are the nares, antrum, pharynx, and oesophagus. In some few cases, when the formation is yet recent and apparently limited, aiid when it has been of secondary origin, free removal of all suspected as well as of all implicated parts may be warrantable. But, in the great majority of cases, palliation only is Avithin our reach; and we should attempt no more.

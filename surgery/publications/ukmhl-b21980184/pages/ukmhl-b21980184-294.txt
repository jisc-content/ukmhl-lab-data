260 CARBUNCLE. it suppurates and slouglis; not in mass, but in detached portions; and as those separate, apertures are formed on the sur&ce through which unwholesome pus, with debris of structure, is discliarged. Secondiiily, the subcutaneous areolar tissue may be involved, and is then prone to run into sloughing. At first the part is brightly red, tense, and burning; mth a peculiar sense of tightness in the pain—corresponding to the strain on the cutis by infarction ; afterwards the colour becomes more dusky, and the feeling rather of sponginess than of tension—except at the margins, where ten- sion still remains. Pressure is intolerable. The swelling is flat, when compared with that of furunculus or of an ordinary abscess ; and instead of central pointing, enlargement and extension are towards the circumference. Carbuncle is usually found in the same situations as furunculus ; but, unlike it, is generally solitary. It may vary in size, from a prune to a soup plate. Progress is slow when compared Avith that of erysipelas; Fig. 103. and ordinarily limited to the surface. But, sometimes, when suitable treatment has been omitted, the deeper parts are also involved ; so as to expose cavities, canals, and bones. The disease most commonly occurs in patients of middle age, or further advanced in life; and especially in those who have indulged, freely and habitually, in the pleasures of the table. It is not conta- gious. Not unfrequently the urine, on being tested, is found saccharine. The constitutional symptoms invariably precede. They are usually asthenic throughout; at first of a simply febrile and bilious character; but as the inflammatory tension and sloughing increase, tending rapidly towards prostration—more especially in the old and feeble—"with hiccup, cadaverous countenance, small pulse, deluium and coma.

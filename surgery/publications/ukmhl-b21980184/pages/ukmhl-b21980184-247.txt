213 NATURAL HEMOSTATICS. turbed; but, remaining in the gap, it became the means of effecting not only temporary but permanent occlusion. In the ordinary circumstances of arterial puncture, the hemostatics are as follow :â€”Blood is infiltrated into the textures exterior to the Fig. 87. sheath, and also between the sheath and the artery; in both situations coagulation takes place ; and the pressure of the clots obviously tends to moderate the flow through the arterial canal, as weU as from the arterial wound. By the infiltration, also, relative position is altered. At the Fig. 88. moment of infliction, the apertures in the sheath and in the artery corresponded; but, subsequently, the track of the wound becomes oblique; and the sheath, where entire, comes to overlap the arterial wound, preventing further escape of blood. It is probable, also, that in many cases the coagulum extends into the arterial gap, nay, may gradually occlude the artery itself And if the sanguineous flow have been much moderated by pressure from the exterior coagula, as well as by the faintness which loss of blood has induced, the obstructing clot may not be loosened or dislodged; but may remain, until removed by absorp- tion, after consolidation of the breach by newly organized product. The formation of this organized product, in and around the gap, constitutes the permanent hemostatics; as in the case of complete Fig. 87. A punctured artery. The wound of the integuments uniform and conti- nuous with that in the vessel; a state favourable to hemorrhage, existing at the time of injurj'. Fig. 88. The same vessel, some time after the injury, in altered circumstances. The track of wound oblique, occupied by blood ; and coagula also infiltrated into the surrounding areolar tissue. The arterial sheath slit open, shewing bloody extra- vasation also there, between the arterial coats and their sheath; a condition alto- gether unfavourable to continuance of hemorrhage.

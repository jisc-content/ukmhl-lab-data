153 ABSORPTION. causes—resuming use of the part, improving the condition of the blood, and applying stimuhis locally, as hy friction or galvanism. Sometimes slight coimter-iiiitatiou seems to be of service. AhsorjpHon. By absorption is meant a wasting of a part by removal of its structure, through excess of corpuscular moulting or decay ; the process gradual, comparatively painless, a,nd non-inflammatory; differing from ulceration Fig. 39. Fig. 40. in the absence of discharge, the waste matter being received back directly into the blood. Absorption may take place at an indefinite number of points in a tissue, or it may advance in a regular and unbroken line ; in the former case it is interstitial, in the latter continuous. Interstitial Ahsooytion is most frequently observed in bone; convert- ing what was dense into cancellated texture. Or, the change being limited to certain points, interspaces of normal tissue remain j the whole having a worm-eaten appearance (Fig. 39). The super-imposed soft textures are usually in a state of passive congestion. The part is shghtly swoln, puffy, and darkly discoloured; there is a deeply-seated uneasiness. Fig. 39. Interstitial absorption in progress, in the cranium ; at a, just begun ; at &, more advanced. It may stop here ; producing a merely cancellous state of the tissue ; or it may advance, becoming merged in ulceration, and producing caries, as in Fig. 40. Fig. 40.

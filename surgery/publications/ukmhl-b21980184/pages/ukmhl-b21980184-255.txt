221 LIGATURE. formation and adhesion of tlio eschar may bo likened to Nature's temporary hemostatics; the plastic formation which precedes, accom- panies, and follows detachment, to the permanent. If such formation be wanting or imperfect, the styptic effect of the cautery will be but ti'iiiporary. Sometimes such is the case ; and therefore, at all times, the ju'riod of the eschar's separation must be one of anxiety and care. And at this time it is well to take additional means for security; by the appHcation of moderate pressure. 7. Ligature.—This is sure and satisfactory; and not to be super- seded or omitted, for liglit reasons, in any case of con- siderable hemorrhage from arterial wound. The ef- fects of a firm round liga- ture, duly applied, will be spoken of in connection with deligation of arteries for the cure of aneurism; at present we consider only the mode of use. The arterial orifice is first laid hold of, and pulled outwards from the surrounding Fig. 97. textures ; in order that the ligature's noose may embrace it, and it alone. For this purpose, a sharp hook, termed a tenaculum, may be employed • hut forceps are more convenient, and usuaUy preferred. They may be such as are used ordinarily in dissection ; not too sharp in their points, •Fig. 96. Tenaculum ; or sharp hook, whereby the arterial orifice is picked out. ^ iJig. 97.

The organ, thus rendered movahle, is transfixed at its baBe » horizontally, by soft iron needles, which are made to perforate a piece of leather, or wood, after emerging from the nose; and by twisting the extremities of the needles, on this exterior foreign substance, tlie due amount of approximation is effected and maintained.* A\nien there is both depression of the ala3 and apex and loss of the columna, the depression is first to be removed; and then a new columna is to be constructed in the way already described. But, in truth, no exact details can be established for any auto- plastic or simply restorative operation on this organ; the proceedings must vary, in almost every case, according to its peculiar circumstances. It is right further to state, that the majority of such operations come under the category of those of "complaisance"—undertaken under no absolute necessity, but rather to please the patient—proverbially prone to untoward casualties in the after-treatment. The flap may shrink or slough ; ulceration may recur; erysipelas, phlebitis, pyaemia, may peril existence. And, at the same time, it is to be remembered that a very good substitute for the lost organ may be adapted by the mechanic, without pain or danger. * Fergiissou's Practical Siu-gery, p. 454; also Association Joui'nal, Feb. 18,1853, p. 154.

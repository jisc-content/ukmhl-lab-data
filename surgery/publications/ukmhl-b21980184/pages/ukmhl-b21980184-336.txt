AVherevor the periosteum is entire, there the formation of this cor- tical bone proceeds, continuously witlx that which was begun by tlie parent shaft. But in several places, it is probable that periosteum is deficient. So soon as the part died, its periosteum became detached from it; and pus was interposed. This pus must, sooner or later, find its way to the surface. And, for this purpose, solution of continuity is Fig. l-2u. Fig. 126. Fig. 127. made in the investing membrane ; either by the knife or by ulceration, more frequently by the latter. Such apertures remain open, not unfre- quently widen, and through them pus continues to be discharged. The cortical formation, probably begun by bone, but maintained—nay, chiefly effected—by periosteum, having reached such an aperture, has its con- tinuity interrupted. Where the membrane is deficient, so is the osseous shell; and an aperture is formed in the newly constructed case of bone, with blood-vessels and nerves ; but also contains more or less of tbe osseous elementary structures along the vessels which have been separated with it from the Haversian canals, as also fragments of living bone, and of granulation-material due to the soft- ening of the osseous tissue.

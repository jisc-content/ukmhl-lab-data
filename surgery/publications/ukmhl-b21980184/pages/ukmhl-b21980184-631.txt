WOUNDS OF THE TEMPORAL ARTERY. 597 ]-enders return of the bleeding certain, on removal or change of the dressing. It is better to abstain from pressure ; and to tie the artery on each aspect of the sore ; either by regular dissection in the line of the vessel; or, when swelling and condensation of texture render that diffi- cult, by transverse woundsâ€”securing the bleeding points by forceps in the orthnary way. Sometimes, however, this would be impossible with- ut an extended dissection; in such circumstances a curved needle V aiTving a wire suture may be passed under the vessel above and below the bleeding point, and upon tying the wire the hemorrhage will be found to be satisfactorily commanded. Or, more simply, a straight needle and twisted sutiu'e may be employed. Or, again, if the ulcer be minute, excision of the changed part may be effected, as for false aneurism. Fortunately, however, such occurrences are rare, since the operation of ai'teriotomy has been restricted to the branches instead of the trunk of the temporal artery.

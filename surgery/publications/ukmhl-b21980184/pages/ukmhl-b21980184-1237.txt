CHANCKES AND SYPHILIS IN THE FEMALE. 1203 Chancres and Syphilis in the Female. In the female, syphilis is peculiar only as regards the primary affec- tionâ€”and the peculiarity is chiefly as to the site : the slightly developed degree of induration of the base of the sore, observed in many cases; the tendency in the sore to undergo a transformation in situ into a condylomatous surface; the early appearance of condylomata, and their per- sistence upon the vulva; while the general character, progress, and results of the chancre, and the constitutional disease, are similar to the occur- rences in the male. Sometimes, again, the chancre is of large size ; and, seated on the labia, may involve one or both in hypertrophy, which sometimes refuses to yield to constitutional treatment, and requires removal by the knife. Chancres of both kinds are usually situated on the inner surface of the nymphse, on the carunculse, and in the orifice of the vagina at the inferior commissure ; but they are also found in all parts of the vagina, on the os uteri, and sometimes in the urethral orifice. They may affect the anus, either primarily, or, in the case of the soft chancre, by discharge from the vulva running in that direction when the patient is recumbent. When an indurated chancre exists at the anus, the mul- tiple glandular enlargement in the inguinal region has usually the most external gland of the chain specially affected. Treatment is as in the male. Warty formations occasionally are of such size, as to require a regiilar dissection for removal of the hypertrophied mass.

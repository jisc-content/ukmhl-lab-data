ADENITIS. 451 Glandular Tumours. Nothing is more common than enlargement of the lymphatic ganglia. But the great majority of such swellings have their origin in simple in- flammatory affection; never requiring the extirpating knife; always amenable either to discussion or to suppurative disintegration. Occa- sionally, however, the glandular parenchyma is the seat of genuine tumour; perhaps supervening on simple inflammatory enlargement; more frequently wholly independent of this. In the latter case, one or two glands only are affected ; not a whole cluster or chain. The growth is more steady, the swelling more distinct; and, in other respects, the characters of the enlargement are such as belong to tumours generally.

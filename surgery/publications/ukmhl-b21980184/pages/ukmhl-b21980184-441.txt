EFFECTS OF LIGATUEE. 407 within which the ligature's noose is deeply imbedded. The highly im- portant, and even essential character of this external formation of plastic material, is fully elucidated by the experiments of Mr. Spence ; from whose unpublished drawings the accompanying illustrations are derived. Ho has shewn clearly that the internal clot, so far from being, as was Fig. 173. Fig. 174; Fig. 175. supposed by Manec and others, essential to the separation of the ligature â€¢without hemorrhage, is not unfrequently wantitig when the vessel has been successfully tied; the closure being entirely effected in these cases by the plastic product between the cut edges of the internal coats, and by the bulky fibrinotis Inass which forms by cell proliferation within and around the sheath. It is this external new formation which, becoming organized, forms the medium whereby blood is supplied from all the Fig. 173. Carotid of a dog ; 48 holirs after deligation.

1371 AMPUTATION AT THE ANKLE. of the plantar aspect of the heel, along wliicli it is continued in a semi- lunar direction. The incision is then curved across the sole of the foot, and terminates on the inner side of the tendon of the tihialis anticus, about an inch in front of the inner malleolus. " The second incision is carried across the outer aspect of the ankle in a semilunar direction, between the extremities of the first incisions, the convexity of the incision downwards, and passing half an inch below the external malleolus. " The flap is now dissected up, care being taken that the Imife cuts close on the bones, so as to preserve the whole thickness of the soft parts. By holding the base of the flap between the fingers and thumb, as it is de- tached from the bones, all risk of wounding the artery at this stage is avoided. The foot is then severed at the articulation, and the ends of the tibia and fibula cleared so as to allow of the application of the saw, by which a thin slice of the extremities of these bones is removed, as in Mr. Synie's operation. " The operation on the left foot is the same, but, as the patient re- clines on the left side, the order of incision is reversed, the knife being first entered at the point above indicated, in front of the inner mal- leolus. " The accompanying sketch represents the form of the stump which is Fig. 386. Fig. 3S7. left, which, it will be observed, differs from that formed by Mr. Syme's operation only in the situation of the cicatrix, which is here on the fibular side of the stump. "With an artificial foot, the patients are able to walk with ease, and but slightly perceptible lameness, the weight of the body resting on the face of the stump."

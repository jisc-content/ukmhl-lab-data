CHAPTER VII. TUMOUES. Perverted nutrition has already occupied our attention, as a result of the inflammatory process. Under the present section, we have an example of perverted nutrition ot a different kind, constituting Tumour; a morbid growth, or new structure, of slow and gradual progress, possessed of a formation and increase distinct from those of the original tissues, and dependent on these for little more than their vascular supply. Tumours have heen called Analogous or Homoeomorphous, when their structure is of a kind resembling some normal texture; as fat, fibrous tissue, cartilage, bone—Heterologous or Hetej'omorplious, when they bear no simihtude to the normal tissues; as scirrhus and melanosis. To the morbid anatomist it is evident that some such classification is desirable— according to his knowledge of morbid structures, derived from minute and careful examination of their characters in the dead body, or after removal from the hving. The practical surgeon, however, is under the necessity of looking for a classification, the elements of which are more within his grasp, and which can be serviceable to him ere yet the tumour has been subjected to his operations, or in any way interfered with. Such a classification has existed, in one form or other, from the most ancient periods; some tumours being universally recognised as of peculiar danger in whatever part they occur, from their connection with an evidently constitutional affection, their tendency to recurrence after removal, and their irresistibly progressive and destructive march; hence called " tumores mali maris" or Malignant On the other hand, tumours not presenting these characters are considered as Simj)le, Benign, or Non-malignant; and although the classification founded on this distinction may, like all others, still prove arbitrary, and its application to some varieties of tumour involve not a few controverted questions, yet it is on the whole the most signifi- cant and practically important division which has been yet established. Non-malignant Qrowtlis are such as are not diffusely infiltrated into the adjacent textures, and do not consume these by involving them in the same degenerated structure with themselves, but simply push them aside, usually condensing a portion into the form of an enveloping and hmiting cyst or capsule ; proving injurious chiefly by bulk and position ; having no tendency to reproduction when thoroughly removed, and being uncon- nected with constitutional cachexy. Malignant tumours, on the other hand, efface the normal texture of the part in which they form, and ever seek their own extension by further change of surrounding textures into resemblance of themselves ; they are connected Avith constitutional dis- order ; their bulk is not so injurious as the pain, hectic, and exhaus- tion which attend on their advancement; when removed, there is no

912 RESECTION OF THE WRIST. Resection of the Wrist. It is easy enough to remove by operation the articulating ends of the • radius and ulna, or to gouge or even cut out the affected parts of the ■ corresponding surfaces of the carpal bones; but the proceeding has not ; been found so satisfactory as to commend itself to the confidence of ; surgeons generally. And, consequently, when this joint is deemed irre- • claimable, amputation is usually preferred. Fortunately, a vast proper- ■ tion of the cases of scrofulous disease of this joint, in adolescents, recover r under use of cod-liver oil, and general anti-strumous treatment—with or i without anchylosis. When the operation is undertaken, two incisions, one on the outer, • the other on the inner aspect of the wrist, should be preferred; the soft parts on both the flexor and extensor aspects are carefully freed by dissection, and division of the bones is effected by the bone pHei-s, bo ( as to enable first the one extremity and then the other to be turned out and sawn away. Afterwards a splint is needed ; appUed on the flexor aspect, and retained till consolidation of the parts is so far complete as to admit of active and passive motion being attempted. Lately, Pro- i fessor Lister and Dr. Buchanan of Glasgow have obtained very encouraging results by this mode of procedure.

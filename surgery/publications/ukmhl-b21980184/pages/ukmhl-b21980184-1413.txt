1379 AFFECTIONS OF STUMPS. matory accessions, whereby ulceration, sloughing, or long gaping of the wound might occur; by opposing excessive retraction of the muscles, if need be, by bandaging—in those cases in which the process of granula- tion is interrupted or tedious. The face of a weU-formed stump is " fenced with firm skin, and no more liable to accident than a man's finger-ends." A Bursa usually forms over the end of the bone ; favouring tolerance of pressure. A blow, or other injury, may induce painful enlarge- ment of this; and the fluctuation, and other characters of the swelling, may simulate the condition of acute abscess very closely. Accuracy of diagnosis is obviously of importance; as, in the one case, early incision is advisable ; while, in the other, rest and fomentation, with perhaps leeching, prove sufi&cient. ■ Hemoi'rhage.—After-bleeding, taking place within a few hours after the operation—when the patient grows warm in bed, and recovers fully from the state of shock—usually requires an undoing of the wound, and the application of ligatures to the open vessels. But if, at the time of operation, due care have been taken to apply deligation accurately to each likely orifice, the occurrence of such a casualty need seldom be apprehended. Hemorrhage which occurs at a more remote period, in consequence of ulceration having attacked the stump, may, if slight, be restrained by pressure. But, in general, deligation of the arterial trunk at the bleeding point is necessary. In some cases deligation of the femoral, after ampu- tation below the knee, or deligation of the humeral, after amputation of the forearm, has been deemed necessary.

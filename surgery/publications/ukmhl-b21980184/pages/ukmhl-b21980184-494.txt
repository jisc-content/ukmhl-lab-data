PAINFUL TUBERCLE. 4G0 that of neuroma; and sometimes containing points, if not actually bloody, at least of a blood-like appearance. Tills last condition, however, may be accidental; the result of external injury. And probably it is so; for the structure, in all other respects, seems to be simple and benign. Another difference from the neuroma is, that whereas in the latter the nervous fibres are very apparent, here the fibrous matter seems to be mainly, if not wholly, a new production. No nervous trunk is con- tinuous with the mass; and only sometimes the minute terminal branches are capable of being traced into it. The tumour is very mov- able ; gliding under the finger. But it is intolerant of the slightest pres- Fig. 198. sure ; intense pain being produced thereby, which the patient—as in the case of neuroma—likens to a galvanic or electric shock. The j)ain is sometimes paroxysmal; induced by the slightest external influence, and sometimes of spontaneous origin. More frequently than the neuroma, it has been associated with hysteria; but, usually, the general health is less disordered than in neuroma. It may occur in any part of the general surface ; but is most frequent in the lower extremities. Treatment is by excision. If the skin be at all involved, it is to be taken away along with the tumour, to the requisite extent, by means of elliptical incision. If the integument be free, a simple wound suffices. There is no reproduction. Some general means may be subsequently expedient, to calm the nervous system from excitement, which the ex- istence of tlie tumour may have induced. Fig. 198.

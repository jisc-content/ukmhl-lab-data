An osteosarcoma, on the other hand, admits of operation till a late period. Its extirpation may be fearlessly attempted, with a good hope of success, even after the tumour has attained an enormous bulk; and experience has fully shewn, that though the opera- tion may bo bloody and severe^ yet it seldom terminates but in a fortu- Flg. 144. nate issue. In a case closely resembling Fig. 144, no single bad symptoms marred the cure, which was permanent. In regard to prognosis also, the tumours widely differ. After removal of an osteocephaloma, even under favourable circumstances, we can never be certain of immunity from return. When a genuine osteo- sarcoma, on the contrary, has been taken away, the mind may be at ease. For return is very improbable ; even when the operation has been per- formed at an advanced age of both tumour and patient. ^ Osteoscirrhus and Osteo-cancer Is comparatively rare. When it does occur, it may be either as a mass of hard, elastic, gray, and shining aspect, formed by a gradual invasion of the osseous and medullary substance, which disappears by transformation into the cancerous mass; or we may find the cancelli still existing of their normal size, or perhaps diminished by transformation of the outer layers of the medullary cells in each cancellus into new bony matter, while the inner portion becomes converted into a true scirrhous substance.

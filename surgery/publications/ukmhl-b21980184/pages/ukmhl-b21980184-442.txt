408 EFFECTS OF LIGATURE. surrounding parts to the important new formations within the external coat of the occluded vessel; and which, by its equable pressure upon the divided ends of the internal coats, prevents the tender adhesions within the sheath from being broken up, when the ligature separates, even when there is no coagiilum. And hence arises an important practical caution; Fig. 176. â–  Fig. 17Y. Fig. IVS. that it is not only advisable, in ligature of an artery, to avoid unneces- sary separation of the vessel fi-om its sheath, but also that every undue interference with the soft parts around is also greatly to be deprecated. According to Mr. Spence, the vessels of the new plastic material are formed with great rapidity. In one instance, in the dog, he found them present in considerable numbers sixty hoiu's after the oj)eration. After a longer time, vessels begin to pass even into the clot when this is pre- Fig. 176.

Nay, that sometimes the whole cicatrix may open up from some trivial cause, and the ulcerated surface resulting prove irri- table or phagedenic. In some instances, the system may even have power enough, by a great and long protracted struggle, to effect complete cicatrization; and may then sink, as if exhausted in the effort. Such are the principles of ordinary surgery, which are suitable to guide lis in the treatment of this form of injury. Some strenuously ad- A'ise stimulating applications from the beginning ; and a theory has been made to suit the practice. IS'either seem to merit unqualified approval. Alcoholic applications may sometimes prove serviceable, on a scalded but imbroken skin. There can be no doubt that, in scalds of the hand or foot, for example, the immediate application of sjDirits of wine is favourable to subsidence of pain. Also, in the severer injuries, any sti- mulant, at first increasing the pain, may afterwards be truly said to deaden it; by accelerating and aggravating the inflammatory process, so as speedily to overcome the impaired vitality, and convert all into one slough. But such is not wise and prudent surgery. In all severe cases, let stimulants, both internally and externally, be retained for their pro- per time and place ; and these will be found in the second, sixth, and ninth indications of cure.

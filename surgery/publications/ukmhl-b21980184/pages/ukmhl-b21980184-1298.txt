VAGINAL FISTULA. 1264 parts must, of course, be utterly alDstaiiied from. Mere fistuljc are quite curaMo in this way. And in the case of any opening, not of larger size than what is barely sufficient to admit the end of the little finger, cure may be thus attempted. In small fistula3, the application of lunar caustic every three or four days is occasionally offoctual. Until a comj)aratively recent period, however, any operative procedure for the cure of vesico-vaginal fistula proved for the most part a failure. Jobert de Lamballe, and Diefl!enbach, certainly employed, with a partial degree of success, an elaborate system of quilled sutures, tapes, and exten- sive accessory incisions to relieve the tension of the line of wound when brought together. In 1849, Dr. Marion Sims, formerly of Alabama, afterwards of New York, and now of Paris, after various unsuccessful Fig. 350. attempts to cure this loathsome malady, fortunately conceived the idea of employing silver wire, instead of the silk, linen, or tape sutures which had previously been used—an idea which has been followed by a marvellous revolution in the use of wire sutures in surgery generally, and constitutes one of the greatest advances made in the practical progress of the nineteenth century. Various ingenious and cumbrous contrivances in the way of clamps, buttons, and wire spHnts, were adopted by Dr. Sims and his early imitators; but at present an almost uniform success, where a sufficiency of tissue remains to admit oi tiie margins of the gap being approximated, follows the use of the jci simplest means. The instruments required are—the speculum aiiea( Fig. 350. Catheter.—Sims.

If tlie formation be recent, pressure will be sufficient to rupture the parietes and to produce diffusion. On applying the thumb, or thumbs, energetically to the part, the cyst is felt to give way ; the tumour collapses ; by pressure and friction continued, the contents are completely expelled ; and then either moderate pressure is maintained, by comj)ress and bandage, to prevent re-accumulation, while occasional smart friction is also used to favour absorption ; or a blister is applied over the ^Dart to excite a sufficient degree of irritation within the sac. If thumbs fail, the part may be struck by any hard substance. Or a fine knife, such as used for division of the iris in the operation for artificial pupil, or for subcutaneous section of tendon, may be introduced at one or more points, to puncture and divide instead of rupturing the cyst; the instru- ment being cautiously withdrawn so as to prevent the entrance of air.

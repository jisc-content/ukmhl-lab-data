AFFECTIONS OF THE BUESA OVER THE OLECRANON. 900 ficial, and not iinlilce tho ordinary veins. Hence a careful examination of tho part should uniformly precede tho performance of phlebotomy.* Affections of the Bursa over the Olecranon. From habitual pressure—as in the miner—this bursa is liable to chronic enlargement, and the affection is to be treated in the ordinary way; by abstraction of pressure, and the application of discutients. Acute bursitis is a frequent consequence of blows on the elbow; and is usually associated with diffuse suppuration and an erysipelatous affec- tion of the surface. Treatment is by puncture and general antipldogistics; and if matter form within the bursa—indicated by the diffuse, tense, brawny swelhng which affects the forearm, and the discharge of a thin ichorous or purulent fluid from the wound of the bursa—the aperture should be enlarged by free incision. * Lately a new variety of the aneurismal lesion has been observed; the artery projecting its contents through the wounded vein, and forming an aneurismal sac by condensation of the areolar tissue exterior to the vein. The deep wound of the vein is closely incorporated with that of the artery ; and the superficial venous apeiture is continuous with the arterial sac. Brit, and For. Med. Chii'. Eev.

VESICO-VAGINAL FISTULA. 12G6 Fig. 352, Plan of tho operation.~SiM.s. surfaces suited to conio accurately together in one straight h'ne. When the bleeding lias l)cen checked by ice water, the sutures are to be intro- duced, and shoidd include, on each side, the whole thickness of the vesico-vaginal septum, except the mucous membrane of the bladder. None of the sutures are to be tied till all have been passed When the aperture is satisfactorily closed, and rendered water-tight, the catheter is introduced, and the patient laid in bed upon her back with a small vessel placed beneath the extremity of the instrument into which the drops of urine may distil. The sutures should not be removed until the eighth day after the operation; and if the twisted ends have been left sufficiently long to be easily seen, and seized by means of forceps, the removal of the stitches is a very easy matter. Where the fistula is extensive^ and Fig. 352. implicates the anterior Hp of the cervix uteri, the Lncision and sutures may require to be carried through the tissues of the neck of the womb; or even the posterior lip may be employed to assist in occupying the gap. When the fistvilous apertiue is very large, and the original destruction extensive, several operations may be requisite, before the fistula is cured; and in some cases, although benefited, complete closure of the aperture may prove impossible. , , The treatment of the urethro-vaginal fistula, and of the recto-vagmai fistula, is conducted upon precisely the same principles; but is much more easily executed. _ â€¢ ^ a o^tn The results of the operative treatment of vesico-vaginal, and recw- vaginal fistula are so satisfactory, in the hands of every surgeon who

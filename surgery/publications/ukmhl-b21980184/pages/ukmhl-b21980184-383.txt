349 RESULT OF CORPUSCULAR MULTIPLICATION. Dr. Eedfcrn, late of Abordoen, in liis excoUont niomoir on the morbid processes in the articular cartilages, gives numerous examples of the changes in the cells mentioned by Mr. Goodsir; and also of the for- mation of the vascular membrane above adverted to. Dr. Eedfern has likewise investigated very closely the changes taking place in the matrix or interccllulai- substance. This, which in the normal state is of homo- geneous aspect and nearly structureless, appears under the influence of disease to split up into bands and fibres ; and these are often found, in partially and slightly diseased joints, giving a soft and velvety aspect to the siu'face of the cartilage. As the disease proceeds, the altered hyaline substance becomes full of corpuscles, which are the result of the bursting and discharge of the cell contents; and these two elements combine to form the fibrous and vascular membrane which is found in con- tact with the cartilage in such cases. This membrane is not, there- fore, as Mr. Key sup- posed, the agent of disin- tegration, but the result of it. The nuclei of the cartilage cells are not un- frequently, according to Dr. Eedfern, converted into fatty granules ; but the most important change is their elonga- tion and transformation into fibres, by being incorporated with the altered hyaline substance.

RICKETS. 318 more apparent than real; depending mainly on tlio appearance due to the altered condition of the shaft. According to Mr. Stanley, actual expansion occurs only in those joints which arc superficial; as the wi-ist ankle, knee, and elhow. In these joints, certainly, the change is best marked and first observed. In all cases, epiphyses are more loosely connected than in health. Although the whole skeleton may have thus degenerated, it is ob- vious that those bones will shew tlio change most, which are most exposed to muscular action, and to the sustaining of superincumlj(;ut Aveight. Consequently, we find the spine, pelvis, and lower limbs, most prominently distorted. The spine may be bent forward, or to the side; usually the curvature is lateral, with more or less rotation of the bodies of the vertebras. These become squeezed in at the concavity of the curve â€”on the front or side, as the direction may happen to be; while, on tlie convexity, the articular processes become commensurately both tliickened and enlarged. Antero-posterior bending has occurred to such an extent as to cause doubling of the aorta, adlaesion of the opposed coats at the folded part, and consequent mal-nutrition of the lower limbs. Tlie tliighs and legs may have their natural curves merely exaggerated; or they may be bent in a variety of fantastic ways. Their bones, however, are not only bent but flattened, and the greater diameter of the bone is antero- posterior in relation to the curve; consequently, when completely ossified, they are not so weak as they otherwise would be. The heads and necks of the thigh bones bend downwards ; and may idtimately come to be on a lower level than the trochanter. Arrest of growth, too, is strongly . Fig. 133.

447 AIR IN TIJE VEINS. the rest of the body for a time but barely sui^plied. The patient is to be phiced recumbent, with the head low, as in ordinary syncope ; while by compression of tlie abdominal aorta, and both axillary arteries, the blood is limited in circulation to the upper part of the body; or, if obesity render pressure on the aorta difficult, both femoral arteries are to be compressed. The second indication is, to maintain the action of the heart, by artificial respiration, galvanism, and friction at the prie- cordial region; thereby affording time and oi^portunity for removal of the obstruction in the pulmonic capillaries, and consequent restoration of the normal circulation. Ammonia to the nostrils, turpentine or brandy as an enema, and aromatic spirits of ammonia, if the patient can swallow, should be employed. Should we tbus succeed in averting the immedi- ately fatal result, means must be taken to prevent or moderate the acces- sion of congestive affections of the lungs, which are apt to ensue. Air forcibly injected into a vein, as by insufflation, produces death almost instantaneously. In this case, death commences in the heart, which is distended and paralyzed by the large amount of air forcibly intruded. Such an event is not likely to occur, however, in the human subject. It has been proposed, in such circumstances, to introduce a flexible catheter into the external jugular vein, as a means of abstracting the air which, according to some, is presumed to occupy the right side of the heartâ€”impeding its action, and by its propulsive effect upon the blood contained in its chambers inducing the anomalous combination of asphyxia and syncope which these cases present. To be of any real ser- vice, this operation would require instantaneous performance, and imply the presence of a very considerable quantity of air to be accumulated within the cavity of the right auricle and ventricle.

SPEllMATORllHCEA. 1244 Anotlior sliding stop affixed to the canula serves, after the distance of the orifice from the part to be cauterized has been ascertained, to prevent the instrument passing further into the canal Having arrived at tlie tender part—which is at once indicated by the feelings of the patient— the stilet is projected, so as to expose tlie caustic ; and, by gently turn- ing the instrument, an efllcioncy of application is insured. Afterwards, strict rest, with antiphlogistic regimen, should be maintained for a day or two ; and, if need be, sedatives are given, either by the mouth or by the rectum Repetition may be required, after a considerable interval This obscure and distasteful class of cases is stiU much in the hands of unprincipled practitioners and quacks. This is no reason, however, for leaving the unfortunate victims in such a predicament, or for denying the existence of such affections. Acknowledging the malady rather as a symptom than as a disease, it seems plainly the duty of om* science and art to afford what assistance may be in our power ; at the same time remembering, that without strict purity of conduct on the part of the patient, all treatment will prove of little avail. It is also most important to remember, that all the alleged cases of this affection, occurring in the-form of "diurnal" spontaneous emis- sions, are mere simulations ; urethral or prostatic gleets ; or conjurings of the patient's own fancy—the result of the state of hypochondriasis produced by the suggestion and imposition of cunning and unprincipled knaves.

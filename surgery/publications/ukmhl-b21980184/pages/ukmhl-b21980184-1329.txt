1295 LIGATURE OF THE ARTERIES OF THE LEG. Should it seem necessary to secure the vessel on tlie instep, by regular dissection, it is found by an incision on the fibular side of the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, in the line of the inter-osseous space. The Peroneal Artery may be exposed, by a free incision on the posterior and tibial aspect of the fibula. It is found concealed beneath the inner edge of the flexor longus pollicis, under cover of the inner margin of the fibula. Deligation of the arteries of the leg, however, being seldom if ever required, except on account of recent wound, all rules for regular dissec- tion may be in a great measure dispensed with ; the extent and form of incision depending very much on those of the wound already existing, and the bleeding point being the best guide to the injured vessel; avoid- ing, however, in all cases, as far as possible, all unnecessary transverse division of muscixlar fibre and tendons. In bleeding from the foot, as in the hand, compression wiU generally be found quite efiicient, and preferable, except in the case of an open wound, to cutting through important parts with a view to the application of ligatm'e. In amputation of the great toe and its metatarsal bone, much difficulty is frequently experienced by copious hemorrhage taking place from the divided commimicating artery, which passes from the dorsal artery of the foot to join the plantar arch. If the vessel is not at once secured by ligature, a pad of lint should be placed in the angle between the second metatarsal bone and the internal cuneiform, and supported in its place by a bandage.

1285 CANCER OF THE UTERUS. for the pains of this, as of all otlier forms of cancer, the great remedy is opium. When the disease is seen in an early stage, the cervix still mobile, and presenting only some prominent indurations—and if other circum- stances, as the general health and age of the patient, are propitious— an attempt may be justifiable to remove the part by excision, or by strong caustics, used as already described in speaking of the inflammatory hypertrophy of the cervix, and of corroding ulcer. If this cannot be done, it is prudent to interfere with the parts as little as possible. If there is much cancerous growth and induration, any violence, such as even introduction of tlie speculum, is liable to do much harm, by tearing or bursting the laccrable structures and inducing hemorrhage.

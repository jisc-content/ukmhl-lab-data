TREATMENT OF ACUTE ABSCESE5. 87 may be such as in tlioir lesion to peril existence almost immediately; hemorrhage may occur from a large artery or vein; tliere may he violent in- flammatory seizure of an internal serous cavity, by purulent irruption ; or the patient may be choked by the pus, in an effort of bronchial escape. It has long been admitted that open abscesses undergoing acute ulcer- ation—in fact changed from the condi- tion of abscess, into that of an acute and spreading ulcer—may expose and perforate blood-vessels, and other im- portant canals. But the power of imopened abscesses to do likewise woiild seem to be by many doubted, if not denied, and made an excuse for delay in evacuation. That occult abscesses, however, have such destruc- tive power imparted by circumstances, not only does theory admit as possible, but experience declares as a fact. In deep abscess of the neck, for example, when pus is bound down by the dense cervical fascia, it is no very uncom- mon thing, when nature is culpably left to struggle unaided under such adverse circumstances, to find an open- ing taking place into either the oesophagus or trachea; and recent examples have not been wanting of still greater hazard, by perforation of either the carotid or the internal jugular* In the one case, a form of False Aneurism is estabhshed; in the other, the train is laid for troublesome, and it may be fatal hemorrhage. It is worthy of note, in a practical point of view, that such suppurative lesion of the vascular tissue is especially apt to occur in young people after Scarlatina; and that, in the open condition of sore, the vein is more apt to suffer than the artery. It may be added, that a chronic abscess which, after having attained to some size, has suddenly become acute, is specially dangerous in this way; all the more if blood-vessels of * British and Foreign Eeview, No. 29, p. 155 ; and Medico-Cliinirgical Trans- actions, vol. 25, 1842 ; also London and Edinburgli Medical Journal, March 1843, p. 177; Ihkl, April 1843, p. 386; IWl, July 1844, p. 632 ; Ihid, April 1845, p. 265 ; Lancet, No. 1025, p. 130; Ihid, No. 1228, p. 287 ; lUd, No. 1377, p. 92 ; Listen, on a "Variety of False Aneurism, London, 1842 ; Liston's Practical Surgery, London, 1846, p. 189 ; Monthly Joui-nal, Feb. 1852, p. 110; lUd, March 1852, p. 277, etc. These are but some of the appropriate cases ; there are others. One seems especially conclusive ; in which the aorta, where in contact with an unopened abscess, wa.s found ulceratively eroded from without; the inner coat alone remaining, attenu- ated yet entire.

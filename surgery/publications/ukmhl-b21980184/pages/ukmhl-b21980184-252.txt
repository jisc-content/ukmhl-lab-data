218 THE TOailNIQUET. and the favouring of venous hemorrhage whieli must necessarily result from so complete an obstruction of venous return. Its advantages are, tliat when applied, it is not likely to become displaced; and, with it, we are so far independent of an assistant. A very convenient form of the instrument is that invented by Dr. Malan; the screw flat, and double, admitting of the principal pressure being more rapidly and powerfully applied; and when adjusted, less in the Avay of the operator, and consequently less apt to be displaced by the accidental application of lateral force. Mr. Skey has con- trived an efficient tourni- quet, with the view of avoiding the evils of uniform circular compression. " It is composed of two semicircles, one of which fits into the other hy running in a groove. Each half is fixed by a sj)ring catch to the other, and may be enlarged or reduced at will In the centre of each semicircle is the pad for pres- sure and counter-pressure, the former being provided with the ordinary screw." Wliatever tourniquet is employed, care must be taken lest by exces- sive continuance of its use the limb be strangled, and gangrene endan- gered, or undue loss of blood be caused by arterial influx being to some Fig. 94.

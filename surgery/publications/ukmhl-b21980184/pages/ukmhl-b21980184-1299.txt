1265 VESIOO-VAGINAL FISTULA, mentioned; a bistoury, either striiight or curved at an angle, set in a long handle; t-wo or three paii'S of long artery forceps; a pair of long dressing or porte-aiguille forceps; two or three surgical sewing needles of different curvatures, suited for silver wire, and carrying a wire of No. 28 or 29 of the draw-plate ; forceps for twisting the sutures, and a double curved catheter, for retention in the bladder after the operation. (Fig. 350.) By some, a long-shanked fork for supporting the wire while twisting, or a wire-twister, is employed. Neither, however, is absolutely essential. The patient having had the bowels thoroughly evacuated by a dose of medicine, given overnight, and followed by a simple enema on the morning of the operation, is placed in the position described. Chloroform Fig. 351. may or may not be given; but as the proceduje is not so painful as it is tedious, it had better be abstained from. The speculum having been introduced, the mucous membrane of the bladder, if prolapsed through the fistula, is kept out of the way by means of a bougie passed by the uretlira. The margins of the opening are then seized by the teeth of the artery forceps, so as to indicate the extent of tissue to be removed by the incision, as well as to make the parts tense, and thus secure smoothness in the section. The cicatricial margin and a small portion Of sound texture are removed from the whole extent of the opening ; the extremities being so included within elHptical incisions, as to render the • Fig. 351. Plan of the parts, previously to the operation.—Sims.

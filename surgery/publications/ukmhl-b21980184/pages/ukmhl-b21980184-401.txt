TREATMENT OF ANCHYLOSIS. 367 rheumatism. Or both forms may be combined; the anchylosis being general, and at every point complete; and almost all traces of previous articulation having become effaced. 2. Fibrous.—The destroyed cartilage is replaced by fibrous tissue; and the opposing surfaces become thus united, giving rise to almost com- plete loss of motion. Frequently this form of anchylosis passes into the preceding. 3. Ligamentous.—The articular surfaces remain unincorporated at every part; but are kept in close union, and more or less immovable, by alteration in the ligamentous apparatus exterior, which has become con- densed, rigid, and non-elastic. 4. Spunous.—In this form, there is neither amalgamation of the bones, nor much, if any, structural change of the proper ligaments of the joint. But plastic change has occurred extensively, exterior to both; the flexor muscles and tendons have become contracted and rigid ; and, from Fig. 161. Fig. 162. this cause, motion is more or less impaired. This state may or may not be conjoined with synovial disease within the articulation ; fre- quently it is. ^ Lastly from hysteria, or a desire to simulate disease, the jomt is kept rigidly fixed from involuntary or voluntary contraction of the muscles by which it is surrounded. Treatment—In every case of anchylosis the diagnosis of its true nature wiU be much facilitated by putting the patient under the influ- ^■nce of chloroform. Then many a joint, which previously had been lirmly fixed, is violently moved in every direction, as the patient struggles 'luring the administration of the drug ; or it relaxes of its own accord, as ' tie patient falls over asleep; while others, in which motion was appa- 'cntly very limited or completely checked, wiU be found much more moDile than they previously seemed.

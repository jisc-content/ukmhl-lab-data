330 OSTEOCEPHALOMA. torior osseous shell, in like manner, is involved ; the surface is reached; ulceration follows ; and the medullary substance, then exposed and un- confined, quickly establishes the condition of fungus. The articular cartilage is usually the structure most resistful, long continuing as a crust or coating at that portion of the tumour which corresponded to the arti- cular end of the bone. The absence of communicating channels between the cells of cartilage, by which tlie imbibition of diseased fluids from the tumour to the cartilage may occur, has been presumed to explain this un- doubted fact. Still cartilage does in some cases yield before the advanc- ing growth. Then the cartilage corpuscles multiply, the hyaline substance becomes proportionately smaller, as well as fibrous in character ; and both cells and fibres are fused with the cancerous growth. In other cases tlie cancer extends from the bone to the synovial membrane, and thence over the surface of the cartilage, enclosing it to some extent within the can- cerous structure. More frequently, the tumour is primary. Medullary from the first; Fig. 140.

Sometimes the origin is in the cancellous tissue, ex- Fig. 140. Section of Osteocephaloma affecting the lo^ve^ part of the femur ; a very common site. The whole bone at that part is converted into a pulpy brain-like mass ; the articular cartilage alone remaining entire. Fig. 141. Ostcocephalonia of the femur, near its middle.

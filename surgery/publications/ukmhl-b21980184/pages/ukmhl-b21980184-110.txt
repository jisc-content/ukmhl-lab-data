76 PASSIVE CONGESTION. and absorption. Contraction of tlie vessels may be further favoured by suitable local applications, as zinc, alum, kino, galls, catechu, etc,â€” especially useful when a mucous or granulating surface is the seat of the aflection ; also by the internal use of general tonics, as the preparations of bark and iron. The latter class of remedies -will, of course, constitute a prominent means of cure in those cases where marked general debility seems to have induced the local disorder, or, at least, to be concerned in its maintenance. Stimuli are sometimes of use, not in procuring simple subsidence of the morbid process, but by acting upon the ultimate textures as excitants to more rapid development. Activity is thus grafted upon indolence; and Passive Congestion may be converted into Active. Then, by ab- stracting the stimulus which caused the change, and employing some of the gentle antiphlogistic means suitable to the new production, reso- lution may be hoped for under circumstances much more auspicious. An example of this has been already quoted, as given in the modem cure of simple hydrocele. Other illustrations occur daily, in the stimu- lating system of treatment so successful in removing passive congestions of the conjunctiva. Care must be taken, however, that our own creation does not become worse than the original malady.

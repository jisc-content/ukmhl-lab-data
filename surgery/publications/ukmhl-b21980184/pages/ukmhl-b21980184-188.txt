The treatment consists in gentle counter-irritation, rest of the affected part, and attention to the general health. This niorbid state of bone is found to be of importance, not so much on its own account, d as in consequence of its being the precursor and accompaniment of one of the most trouble- some diseases with which our art has to con- tendâ€”caries (Fig. 40). Continuous Absorption differs from the preceding in being continuous, instead of in- terstitial or interrupted, occasioning continu- ous loss of substance. Familiar examples are afforded by the gradual disappearance of texture, both hard and soft, before slowly increasing pressure; as in the case of aneurism. And pressure may be considered as the most frequent exciting cause. Treatment consists in abstraction of the cause. Fig. 41. Continuous absorption illustrated by the pressure of an aortic aneuiism on the bodies of the vertebrae ; a, the arch of the aorta ; h, the descending aorta ; c, the vertebral column. Opposite d, the bodies of the vertebrae are seen excavated, with cori'esponding processes of the compressing clot; while the intervertebral substances, successfully resisting the pressure, project into corresponding depressions of the fibrin.

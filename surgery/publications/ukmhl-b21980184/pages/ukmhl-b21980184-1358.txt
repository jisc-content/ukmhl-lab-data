DISLOCATION INTO THE ISCIIIATIC NOTCH. 1324 whole body cannot bo straiglitened in tlio recumbent posture ; if the trunk be smoothed down, the thigh rises up ; and if the hmb he forcibly and .painfully straightened, the loins are found immediately and insuper- ably arched—and this, which is the most characteristic sign of all, will not cease, until reduction has been effected. Eeduction is made with the patient recumbent, on his sound side • and the affected Hmb is extended obliquely, so as to bring it across the middle of the sound thigh. After extension has been maintained for some time, the head of the bone is lifted over the margin of the aceta- bulum, by means of a jack towel placed under the upper part of the Fig. 357. Fig. S58. thigh; extension in that direction being made, by passing the loop of the towel over an assistant's neck, while counter-extension is exerted by the hands of another assistant resting firmly on the patient's pelvis. But it is not to be supposed that such movements are to interfere with the main extending force; the two are carried on consentaneously. This dislocation is also well suited for reduction by manipulation, as already described in the treatment of the former injury. In employing the manipulation method, as the head of the bone comes in contact with the edge of the acetabulum, there is a risk, if the abduction is too suddenly effected, of converting the dislocation into the next form of displacement.

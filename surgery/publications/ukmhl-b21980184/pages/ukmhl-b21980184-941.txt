DEFOEMITIES OF THE HAND. 907 by a central groove. In such a case, nothing need or can be done, the fiugei-s being more useful when united than they could be other- wise. Should an actual web of union exist, and should separation bo wished, that is obtained by division of the abnormal band; great care being taken, during cicatrization, to prevent reunion of the opposed parts. And, for this piu'pose, interposition of dressing is not enough; it is essential, as in the case of burns, to make constant and considerable pressure on the angle of union, at the knuckles; and this is done by means of a piece of cord or tape, placed and retained there. Ingenious devices have been employed, to secure cicatrization of the angle of the fingers before effecting the division of the web. Thus, a piece of metal has been introduced through an aperture, and retained there, its size being gi-adually augmented by fresh additions, till cicatrization is secure at the point of natural union; then the rest of the web is severed. By some, a flap of cutaneous texture is transplanted, so as to occupy the angle of convergence, after the ordinary operation of division of the web has been completed. Chib-hand, a condition analogous to club-foot, occasionally occurs, congenitally. It is remediable, at an early age—with or without the aid of tenotomy—by the wearing of suitable apparatus. In dividing the tense tendons, this shoidd not be effected in the hand or fingers, but above the annular ligament of the wrist; each tendon being divided sepa- rately, as thus aU risk of injury to the median nerve is prevented. Afterwards, the management of such cases is usually intrusted to the machinist. And it is also the province of that profession to atone, by mechanical substitutes, for deficient development of the hand or fingers.

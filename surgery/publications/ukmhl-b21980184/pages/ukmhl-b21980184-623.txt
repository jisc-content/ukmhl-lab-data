OPERATIONS. 589 regulating the play of the general circulation, controlling the efforts of the vis vitce—in short, averting both local and general disaster, and bringing the healthful work of repair to complete, though it may be slowly, its valued process of cure ; and when ultimately a thorough and permanent success croAvns such patient and anxious labours—surely the cause for self-gratulation is increased a hundred-fold; the surgeon may well say that a far better thing has been done by his art; and the discerning pubHc should not fail to award a higher and truer meed of praise. The advance of surgery will ever be found characterised by a corre- sponding decrease of its operations, both in amount and in severity. The true object of our mission is not to cut, but to cure.

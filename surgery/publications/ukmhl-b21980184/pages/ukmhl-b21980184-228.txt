FUNGUS II^;MATODES. 194 In tumours, there may bo two steps of degeneracy ; from the simp] structure to tlie medullary; from the latter, to tlie condition of fungus haimatodes. But, usually, the medullary formation, from which the bleeding fungus springs, is of primary origin. All medullary tumours, when open, tend to fungate; but all medullary fungi are not entitled to the appellation of fungi hcematodcs. It is easy to understand, however, hoAV the hromatoid condition sliould not unfrerpiently occur; by softening and breaking down of the medullary texture, whereby one or more of the large vessels found permeating such growths are opened into. A detached portion of the medullary mass, or a fresh protrusion, may tem- porarily occlude the aperture; but, in its turn, it crumbles away, and the bleeding recurs. The part is obviously incapable of adopting the ordinary natural ha3mostatics. This is the most malignant of all morbid structures, and little amen- able to treatment. There is no hope but from early removal by the knife; and, in most cases, amputation of the member is preferable to excision of the part. But do what we will—however early, however Fig, 80. summarily—too generally the disease returns, and the patient falls i victim. And when we consider that the greater number of cases a merely the advanced stage of meduUary cancer, we can readily unde stand how the experienced and judicious surgeon, encountering example of fungus hsematodes, often finds himsehf constrained to no interference, and has to content himself with palliating what he cann cure. Before leaving the subject of tumours, it may be well to make so~ general observations on their removal by the Imife. Sometimes, even the most experienced are in doubt as to the exa Fig. 80.

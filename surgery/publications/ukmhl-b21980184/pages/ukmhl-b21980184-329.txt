295 TREATMENT OF CARIES. luiproHtable partâ€”necrosis. fcsuch destructive process is necessarily acute, and follows the course of an acute abscess which, witli its contained debris, and perhaps sequestra, finds its way to the surface in the usual manner ; and is thence discharged. The auxiliary treatment allbrded by our art, in suspected disease of these inaccessible parts, is in the first jDlace to prevent occurrence of cai'ies if possible, by attention to the general health, rest of the part, and counter-irritation. When caries has doubtless begun, we do little more than abide the working of ISTature ; watching over the general health, and maintainiug for the affected part a comj)lete immunity from motion. But when the work of destruction has become acute, and the indications of advancing abscess are plain, the question immediately arises as to the expediency of incision. In general it is well to carry out the general Fig. 119. Fig. 120. Fig. 121. principles of surgery, by opening the dependent or pointing part freely. The inflammatory process which necessarily follows we anxiously watch, and may perhaps attempt to subdue; while the powers of the general system are husbanded and maintained. It can be readily understood, however, that in but few cases a successful issue is to be expected for this natural process of cure. By ulceration the original carious surface may be destroyed ; but, most pro- bably, only to induce a continuous extension of the carious state. A sound portion of bone, fit for repair, may never be reached; every successive effort of separation and repair, as in progressive senile gangrene, ending Fig. 119.

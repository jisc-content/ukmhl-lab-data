I N J U E I E S CHAPTER XIX. THE SHOCK OF INJUEY. More or less depression of the nervous system, with a secondary and similar result on the heart and pulse, is usually the immediate result of mechanical injury inflicted on the living frame ; proportioned in extent to the intensity of the external violence, the amount of the frame that is injured, the relative importance of the injured part in the general animal economy, and the previous state of the system. This depression is of an aggravated character—resembling very closely the effects of copious loss of blood—for example, when a portion of a limb has been crushed to jelly by a heavy weight; when a whole limb has been bruised, scalded, or burned; when an internal organ, such as the liver, kidney, bowel, lung, or brain, has in any considerable degree sustained lesion ; when an injury, perhaps in itself not very severe, has been done to a frame either originally weak, or enfeebled by intemperance, by previous disease, or by either extremeness of age. In military practice, the importance of bullet-wounds of the trunk is often judged of by the amount of at- tendant shock ; if depression be slight and transient, the probability is that the wound is but superficial, and at all events that the important internal organs have escaped ; if it be both great and protracted, the prognosis is on the contrary unfavourable, the inference being that the wound has reached a vital part. The Symptoms of nervous shock, after injury, vary from the slightest appreciable lowering of the vital powers, to complete syncope. Ordi- narily, the patient falls, and lies helpless, cold, shivering, more or less unconscious, and when roused, probably incoherent; convulsions may supervene; the pulse is rapid, small, fluttering, indistinct; respiration is imperfect and sighing ; nausea and vomiting are common—the latter not infrequently preceding reaction, and seeming to be concerned in its in- duction ; a cold sweat bedews the shrunk and pale surface ; the features are collapsed ; the countenance bears a somewhat anxious expression, or else, by entire muscular relaxation, is a vacant death-like blank; the eyes roll wildly and restlessly, or else are fixed in an upward, listless stare, with the upper eyelid partially closed over the pupil; often the sphincters are relaxed, fseces and urine seeming to pass involuntarily ; sometimes the secretion from the kidneys is suppressed; the cerebral

1256 AMPUTATION OF THE PENIS. wliich curries a silk ligature, lie unites each flap of meiuLraue to the skin by a suture. The wound heals by the first intention ; adhesions form between the skin and mucous membrane; and these textures be- come continuous—a condition analogous to what is observed at the other natural outlets of the body. The cicatrix then contracting—instead of operating prejudicially, as in the old method—tends to open the urethra, by pulling its lining membrane outwards. A more satisfactory method has suggested itself to us recently, though no opportunity for putting it in practice has occurred. A narrow-bladed knife is first used to transfix the penis between the spongy and cavernous body, close to the root; the knife having been carried forwards for an inch and a half, its edge is turned perpendicularly downwards, and the urethra and skin flap are divided; the cavernous bodies and dorsal integument being then cut perpendicularly upwards, where the knife was originally entered for transfixion. A button-hole is afterwards made in the lower flap, through which the corpus spongiosum and urethra protrude; while the flap itself is turned upwards, and attached dorsally and laterally, so as to cover in the exposed cavernous structure. When, in the case of a short stump, inconvenience results from in- ability to direct the stream of urine in a sufficiently outward jet, the deficiency of the organ may be temporarily compensated^ when the patient makes water, by a mechanical adaptation—a funnel-shaped canula, of sufficient length, its base resting on the pubes.

AFFECTIONS OF THE DIAPHEAGM. 1005 tween the base of the lung and the margins of the aperture ; but when the wound is small, and the patient is kept quiet, there seems no good reason to suppose that the lesion will not heal; the only ground for such suspicion being the fact, that a few cases have occurred where, after many years—in one example after nearly twenty-two—a fatal result ensued in consequence of the patency of the aperture. The risk of protrusion is especially great when the wound happens to be on the left .side. The great danger, however, is not so much in the protrusion—which may exist for years, and form extensive adhesions within the pleural cavity —but by the occurrence of strangulation in the diaphragmatic hernia. In some cases, from simple displacement, the thoracic organs may suffer chronic disorder, not without a risk of ultimate asphyxia. Rupture of the diaphragm may be produced by external injury or violent muscular effort. The risks by consequent misplacement of the abdominal organs are as in the former case. Such malposition is usually indicated by an anxious expression of countenance, a sunk empty state of the abdomen, corresponding fulness of the chest, thoracic percus- sion unusually clear or unusually dull, auscultation affording borborygmi rather than respiratory murmur, with obscuration of the sounds of the heart. In treatment but little is in our power. Should paralysis of the diaphragm co-exist with ascites, obviously great care is specially necessary in withdrawing the fluid by paracentesis, lest dangerous collapse occur.* * Von. C. W.

CAUSES OF MORTIFICATION. 13G 6. Ohstrudion to Venous Return.—The gangrenous effect of this is indirect. Passive congestion is induced ; and so long as the obstacle to venous return continues, venous accumulation, witli consequent effusion into clie surrounding parenchyma, is inevitably increased. This abnor- mal state, necessarily weakening vital power, is also likely to excite the inflammatory process, as for- merly shewn; and then, but a slight amount of this may suffice to arrest vitality. Thus, gangi-ene of the whole fore-arm has resulted from injudicious bandaging, or other deligation of the arm; no support having been afforded to the parts beneath. Or the obsti-uction may be by spontaneous change in the principal venous trunk ; as by coagulation of its contents. Or it may be the result of compression by tumours of various kinds; or by organic change in internal organs—as the liver and heart. 6. Deprivatio7i of Nervous Agency also acts indirectly. Bed- sores, by sloughing, are well known to be most prone to form in cases of injury of the spine ; the pressed parts being paralytic. Power is diminished, a tendency to inflam- matory accession is iaduced, and the application of a comparatively slight stimulus suffices to ensure the gangrene. Sometimes, no direct exciting cause is necessary. The cornea has sloughed after division of the fifth nerve ; the same act at once arous- ing the inflammatory process, and cutting off the nervous agency. 7. Interruption to Arterial Sup- ply.—This may be complete; caus- ing a direct cessation of life. A Fig. 86. tourniquet placed and retained so tightly on a limb as to arrest entirely its circulation, inevitably entails death of the whole limb beneath tlie encircled point; for, invariably, on complete arrest of circulation, the vital process ceases, and chemical change begins.

TREATMENT OF SCROFULA. 208 until an opportunity has been afforded for disintegration of the tubercle being at all events efficiently commenced, if not perfected. Caustic potass is then used as the opening agent; destroying attenuated skin so far as may seem necessary, and, if need be, at the same time making a destructive thrust into the tuberculated part. The matter is eva- cuated, and the diseased texture sooner or later comes away; granula- tion is in due time commenced, and the ordinary means are then adopted to favour its progress and completion. Constitutional treatment is maui- tained, uninterrupted; and must be long persevered with, after apparent local cure; for, in the general system is the true seat of the disorder. It is almost unnecessary to state that chronic enlargements of lym- phatic glands, by tubercular formation, as in the neck, are not to be made the subject of severe surgical operation. Discussed they may be; or by suppuration they may be broken down and extruded ; but extirpa- tion by the knife is in truth an unwarrantable cruelty.

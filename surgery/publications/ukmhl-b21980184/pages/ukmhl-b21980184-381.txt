347 DISEASES OF CARTILAGE, The following is Mr. Listen's description of this affection in its advanced condition. "The synovial membrane may be studded, on its inner aspect, with pendulous substances projecting into the cavity of the joint; sometimes of almost cartilaginous consistence, but more frequently of a fatty appearance. The entire surface of the membrane is occasionally covered with these bodies, which are of a white or yellowish colour, and very variable in size and shape; the smallest presenting the form of villi not much larger than those of the jejunum, the largest having someAvhat the magnitude and appearance of the appendices epiploicJB of the large intestine, while many of an J^^^^&r intermediate size approach in appearance to a lemon i^^^^^^^^ seed. In some instances the membrane is only par- mM^^^S^^ tially pervaded by them; and sometimes, they are ^M^^p arranged like a fringe around the edge of the arti- ^M^^'fv^^ cidation. They are generally very smooth on the J3|^^p^|^^^ surface; which appears to be perfectly continuous, ^S^^^y^/^v| if not identical, with the synovial membrane. Their ^h|^^^^^^ attachment is sometimes broad, sometimes very ^^^^^^y^^ narrow and pedunculated, often merely filamentous; Fig. 145. so that a Httle further thinning of the part, or slight force acting on the body, would remove it from the capsule, and tlirow it loose into the cavity of the articulation. The disease has been most frequently seen in the knee, and sometimes in the elbow. " The affection is obscure in its nature, and slow in its progress; the joint is the seat of pain after and during exercise, probably from the abnormal processes interfering with motion of the articular surfaces. As the disease advances, the joint becomes swelled and elastic ; un- attended, generally, by ulceration of the tissues within or around it. In examining the part, when the articular surfaces are moved on each other, it will be found that their motion is more or less interfered with; and considerable irregularity in their action may be felt, by the hand placed firmly on the joint during the procedure." * In many cases these developments constitute a part of the changes in an articulation included under the name bestowed upon them by Mr. Adams of " chronic rheumatic arthritis." Disease of Cartilage. Loss of substance may take place in cartilage, by either a rapid or a slow morbid process; and either with or without disease of the other structures involved in the joint. It is now well understood by physiologists, that nutrition of the tex- tures takes place according to the laws and powers inherent in the essential elements of those textures themselves; and that the blood- vessels are only in so far subservient to the act of nutrition, as they furnish to the texture the materials for its renewal.

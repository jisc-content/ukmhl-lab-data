In two ways ai-t may promote the cure of aneurism ; by retarding tho anourismal How, and so favouring consolidation of the contents ; or by aicUng the textures Avhich overlay the aneurism, and which are, as it were, continually striving to keep it down and repress its growth. The one method diminishes the expansive power from within ; the other increases the repressive power from without. The latter corresponds to the old method of applying pressure ; the former to tho modern. Tliis method was made trial of in the beginning of the century by Pollctan, Dubois, A. Cooper, Blizard, etc. j but with no satisfactory issue. The pressiu'e was continued and severe ; their object being to keep the arterial tube close and impervious at that point, and by plastic change to obtain its complete consolidation. The result was, the occurrence of great pain and constitutional disturbance, followed by ulceration, or sloughing of the compressed parts—exposing, or perhaps including, the vessel. The practice found no favour with the general profession. But twenty years ago the treatment by pressure was revived by Mr. Tlutton Fig. 182. Pig. 18.3. and Dr. BeUingham of Dublin, in a modified form, and with a better suc- cess ; conducted rather as if itself were not the agent of cure, but only the means whereby spontaneous cure may be originated and favoured. The pressure, besides being made at a Hunterian site, is neither constant nor severe. By means of a compressor, such as invented by Signoroni {^^- 91, p. 217)—or by means of this other instmment, adapted from a carpenter's clamp, and first suggested by a carpenter, Hoey, who was mmseli the subject of aneurism, and cured by tliis means—a moderate wel'frp^.^^' '^1^'''^' "^^^ ; ^ the point of counter- i <»sure , a, that which compresses the artciy. the nIS l?-^' ■Pl; i"«trnment for compressing the femoral at its lower part; a, the Zl ' T, ^^"^'^ ' ^' P^^^ '""^ counter-pressure on the back port of • "■^^ ; c, tlie compressor ; d, the elastic arrangement.

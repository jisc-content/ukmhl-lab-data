536 THE RECTUM AND ANUS. is characteristically indurated. The tumour grows slowly, and tends to spread on the cutaneous surface rather than towards the lumen of the bowel. It causes a considerable amount of pain and slight bleeding. The inguinal lymphatic glands are usually enlarged. The treatment consists in excising the growth, and this usually entails sacrificing the sphincters. Prolapse of the Rectum or Procidentia Recti.—The term “prolapse” is applied when any portion of the rectum is pro- truded beyond the anal margin. When the protrusion consists merely of the rectal mucous membrane, it is spoken of as a children and between the ages of fifty and sixty. Causes.—In most cases several factors contribute to the pro- duction of the prolapse, the most important and constant of which are undue laxity of the perineal and rectal tissues, in- cluding the sphincter and levator ani muscles, and some cause of repeated and excessive straining. In young children, for example, after any exhausting illness the perineal muscles are liable to become weakened and relaxed, and the pads of fat which surround the rectum disappear, and thus the bowel is deprived of its natural support. If, under these conditions, the patient suffers from constipation, diarrhoea, rectal polypus, worms, phimosis, stone in the bladder, or any other condition which induces severe straining, prolapse of the 'partial or incomplete pro- lapse ; when all the coats of the bowel are pro- truded the prolapse is said to be complete (Fig. 122). The term “ procidentia recti” is applied to the complete form. In the complete variety the peri- toneum which forms the pouch of Douglas is sometimes dragged down in front of the prolapsed portion, and it is possible for a loop of intestine to enter the cul-de-sac thus formed.

The term “anaesthesia ” was suggested by Oliver Wendell Holmes when, in 1846, Morton first demonstrated that the inhalation of ether abolished consciousness and the sensation of pain. General anaesthesia may be defined as a state of unconscious- ness and of insensibility to external impressions, which will allow of a surgical operation being performed painlessly; while local anaesthesia is a condition of insensibility to painful stimuli in a restricted portion of the body, and unaccompanied by loss of consciousness. General Anesthesia. The general anaesthetics most frequently employed for pro- longed operations are chloroform, ether, and certain mixtures of these. The mixture we have found most useful has been one part of chloroform and two of ether, for convenience spoken of as the CE. mixture. For brief operations inhalations of nitrous oxide, chloride of ethyl, or the mixture of the latter with bromide of ethyl, known as “ somnoform,” are commonly employed. Preparation of the Patient for a General Anaesthetic.— Except in cases of emergency the patient should be prepared for the anaesthetic by having his diet and general mode of living regulated for a few days. When it is possible, he should be kept at rest in hospital or in a nursing home for two or three days, although he need not be confined to bed during the whole of this period. A purgative should be administered about thirty-six hours before the operation, and the lower bowel cleared out with an enema some hours before its actual performance. No solid food should be given within twenty-four hours, but it is well to give the patient a cup of beef-tea or clear soup three or four hours before. Starving is often overdone, especially in delicate

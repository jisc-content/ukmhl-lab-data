FOREIGN BODIES. 261 The irritation caused by the foreign body in the bronchus may set up bronchitis or pneumonia, and abscess of the lung may supervene. In some cases the physical signs closely simulate those of pulmonary phthisis. The treatment consists in performing low tracheotomy and attempting to remove the body with curved forceps, bent wires or other suitable appliances, or with the aid of the bronchoscope. Attempts have been made to reach foreign bodies in the bronchi by opening the chest, but the results have not been encouraging.

504 THE 11ECTUM AND ANUS. frequently the canal is represented by a depression which admits the tip of the little finger, but does not communicate with the rectum (Fig. 113). In some cases the cavities are only separated by a thin septum—the remains of the cloacal membrane ; in others, a bridge of fibrous tissue, vary- ing in thickness, intervenes between them. Clinical Features.—These abnormalities may escape notice until the attention of the nurse is drawn to the fact that the infant’s bowels have not moved. An examination of the perineum then reveals the deformity. If nothing is done to permit the meconium to escape the infant becomes unduly restless and irritable, and appears to suffer from abdominal pain. There is continuous straining and frequent vomiting, and the abdomen becomes distended, tense, and tender. If unrelieved, symptoms of peritonitis ensue and the condition proves fatal. The anal canal is some- times abnormally narrow, al- though otherwise fully de- veloped. The meconium and fluid fasces escape quite freely, but constipation results if the motions become solid. The rectum 'proper may be entirely absent, the colon end- ing in the pelvis as a cul-de-sac (Fig. 112). In some cases the anal canal is also absent; in others it is fully developed, but is separated from the colon by a thick bridge of fibrous tissue. A more common deformity is that in which the rectum, although fully formed, does not communicate with the anal canal Fig. 112.—Complete absence of Rectum, the Colon ending in a large Dilatation and the Anus being normally de- veloped.

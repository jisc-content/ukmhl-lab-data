IMPOTENCE AND STERILITY. 693 The presence of a tight stricture of the urethra with fistulas behind it through which the semen escapes also involves sterility. The gyrognosis and treatment of these conditions vary with their cause. When due to gross anatomical defects or to organic lesions either of the sexual organs or of the central nervous system, they are for the most part permanent and incurable. When they result from psychical and moral causes, the functions may be restored by general treatment directed towards the neurasthenia. The patient should be encouraged by the assurance that his condition is temporary and curable. Electrical treatment, and the use of such drugs as strychnin, cantharides, and phosphorus are often beneficial. All forms of local treatment are to be avoided, and the patient should abstain from intercourse for a time. When the condition is due to drug habits, recovery ensues if the habit is broken.

77 TRAUMATIC LESIONS OF THE CORD. which are derived from the fourth cervical segments. There is also paralysis of the cervical sympathetic. Respiration is almost exclusively carried on by the diaphragm. Hiccough is often persistent. There is at first retention of urine, followed by dribbling from overflow. Sugar is sometimes found in the urine. Priapism is common. The pulse is slow (40-50) and full; and the temperature often rises very high—a symptom which is always of grave omen. When the lesion is confined to the sixth cervical segment the arms assume a characteristic attitude, as a result of the con- traction of the muscles supplied from the higher segments. The upper arm is abducted and rotated out, the elbow is sharply Fig. 11.—Attitude of Upper Extremities in Traumatic Lesions of the Sixth Cervical Segment. The prominence of the abdomen is due to gaseous dis- tension of the bowel. flexed, and the hand supinated and flexed (Fig. 11). Sensation is retained along the radial side of the limb. When the lesion is confined to the first dorsal segment the attitude of the arm is also characteristic. There is slight abduc- tion at the shoulder and flexion at the elbow, the forearm lies semipronated on the chest or belly, and there is slight flexion of the fingers. Lesions of the lower cervical segments are usually fatal in from two or three days to as many weeks, from embarrassment of respiration or hypostatic pneumonia. Dorsal Region.—In injuries of the dorsal region—second to eleventh dorsal segments inclusive—the anaesthesia below the level of the lesion is complete and its upper limit runs horizontally round

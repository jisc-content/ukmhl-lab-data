POTT’S DISEASE. 95 knees. In this way the weight is partly taken off the affected vertebra* and borne by the arms. If the child be laid on its back and lifted by the heels, the spine remains rigid. By this test a projection due to tuberculous disease may Ire differentiated from one due to rickets, as in the latter case the projection disappears. The patient often complains of pain in the abdomen—which in children may be mistaken for a simple “ belly-ache ”—and of pain shooting down the buttocks and into the legs. Psoas Abscess.—When an abscess forms it usually occupies the sheath of the psoas muscle, in which it spreads down towards the iliac fossa, and into the thigh, passing beneath Poupart’s ligament, posterior and external to the femoral vessels '(Fig. 18). The communication between the pelvis and the thigh is often very narrow, so that the abscess cavity has some- what the shape of an hour- glass. The pus may reach the surface in the region of the saphenous opening, or may spread farther down the thigh under cover of the deep fascia. In some cases, as the swelling becomes smaller when the patient lies down, and appears to Fig. 18.—Left Psoas Abscess, have an impulse on cough- ing, it is liable to be mistaken for a femoral hernia. Lumbar Abscess.—Sometimes the pus travels along the pos- terior branches of the lumbar vessels and nerves to the outer border of the erector spime, and comes to the surface in the space between the edges of the latissimus dorsi and external oblique muscles—the triangle of Petit. In rare cases it passes through the sacro-sciatic foramen and forms a swelling in the buttock (sub-gluteal abscess) ; or it may pass through the obtur- ator foramen and reach the surface in the adductor region of the thigh or in the perineum. Lumbo-sacral Begion.—Pott’s disease in the lumbo-sacral region usually affects adults, and, on account of the breadth of

35 FRACTURES OF THE VAULT. bone, but fissured fractures may leave no trace. Gaps left in the skull by injury or operation are, after a time, filled in by a fibrous membrane, ossification takes place from the margin, but the aperture is seldom completely closed by bone. The new bone which forms is derived from the dura mater and pericranium at the margins of the opening. The existence of permanent defects in the skull may cause the patient to become giddy when he stoops or exerts himself unduly, and may thus seriously interfere with his occupation. Varieties.—For descriptive purposes fractures of the vault are divided into the fissured, the punctured, the depressed, and Fig. 7.—Fracture of Skull produced by an oval stone (a) fired from a gun. Note fissures radiating from point of entrance of missile. the comminuted varieties. Clinically, however, these different varieties are often combined. The practical importance of a given fracture depends upon whether it is simple or compound, rather than upon the exact nature of the damage done to the bone. Compound fractures which open the dura mater are the most serious. Simple fractures result, as a rule, from diffuse forms of violence, and are liable to spread far beyond the seat of impact. Compound fractures result from severe and localised violence—for example, the kick of a horse or the blow of a hammer, and tend to be limited more or less to the seat of impact. Fissured fractures generally result from blows by blunt objects or from falls, and they usually extend far beyond the area struck, in many cases passing into the base of the skull. The

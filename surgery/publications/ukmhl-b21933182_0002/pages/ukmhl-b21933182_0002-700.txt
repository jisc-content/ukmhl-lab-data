680 THE MALE GENITAL ORGANS. Tlie ordinary or acquired hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis comes on insidiously in middle-aged men, and forms a pyriform, rounded or oblong swelling which begins in the lower part of the scrotum, and gradually enlarges from below upwards. It is smooth on the surface, uniform in outline, tense and elastic in consistence, and stands out prominently in the scrotum (Fig. 152). When the walls of the sac are calcified, a sensation of egg-shell cracking may be elicited on squeezing the swell- ing. On percussion it is dull and may yield a peculiar thrill. In early cases the swelling may be translucent, but too much weight must not be attached to this sign, as thickening of the wall of the sac, the presence of adhesions, discoloration of the contained fluid, or other causes may render it opaque. There is no true impulse on coughing, but the contraction of the abdominal walls may give an apparent impulse. The fluid does not leave the scrotum when the patient lies down, and cannot be reduced into the abdominal cavity by pressure. There is no pain, but the weight of the fluid causes a dragging sensation along the line of the cord. The testis can usually be palpated behind the hydrocele, sometimes at the lower part of the scrotum, sometimes about halfway down (Fig. 153). The two sides are affected with about equal frequency, but sometimes the condition is bilateral, and Fig. 152.—Large Hydrocele of left Tunica Vaginalis in a man aet. 45.

Under these con- ditions the urine may irritate the skin of the scrotum and produce eczema or excoriations. The swelling is usually confined to the scrotum, but a funnel- shaped process sometimes passes towards the inguinal canal and

39 FRACTURES OF THE BASE. skull is compressed from side to side, the line of fracture through the base is usually transverse, and it may implicate one or both sides (Fig. 8). When the pressure is antero- posterior, on the other hand, the fracture tends to be longitudinal, and when oblique it tends to be diagonal. When the force acts in a line from the occiput to the vertex, in a fall on the buttocks for example, the usual fracture is a more or less circular fissure around the foramen magnum. Von Bergmann, Bruns, and Messerer have done much to elucidate the mechanism of basal fractures. Fractures of the base fissure, or series of fissures, which, as a rule, run through the foramina in their track. Small portions of bone are sometimes completely separated. It is very com- mon for a fissure through the base to be continued for a considerable distance into the vault. The fracture may in- volve only one fossa, but as a rule fissures radiate into two or all of them (Fig. 8). Fractures of the anterior and middle fossae are usually com- pound through opening into the pharynx, nose, or ear. Basal fractures are very frequently associated with contusion and laceration of the brain, and also with injuries of one or other of the cranial nerves. It must be admitted that in a large proportion of cases which end in recovery the diagnosis of fracture of the base is little more than a conjecture. The external evidence of damage to the bone is so slight and so liable to be fallacious that little reliance can be placed upon it. The associated cerebral and nervous symptoms also are only presumptive evidence of fracture of the bone. In all cases, however, in which there is reason to suspect that the base is fractured, the patient should be treated on this assumption. It is often found that, when there are no usually take the form of a single Fig.8.â€”Transverse Fracture through Middle Fossa of Base of Skull, with fissures radi- ating into anterior and posterior fossse.

THE STOMACH. 390 curvature is directed forwards and towards tire left, and gives attach- ment to the gastro-colic portion of the great omentum, which contains the right and left gastro-epiploic vessels. The duodenum occupies chiefly the right half of the epigastrium. Having no mesentery it is fixed to the posterior abdominal wall, and is separated from the aorta and vena cava merely by loose connective tissue. Its anterior surface alone is covered by peritoneum. In the concavity of its curve lies the head of the pancreas. The common bile-duct joins the pancreatic duct behind the second portion of the duodenum, and the two open by a common orifice on its inner aspect (Fig. 106). The duodenum joins the jejunum about one inch to the left of the middle line at the level of the second lumbar vertebra. In the vicinity of this junction the peritoneum forms a fossa—the duodeno-jejunal fossa—into which a portion of intestine may be prolapsed, constituting one form of internal hernia. Operations on the Stomach. To avoid repetition it is convenient here briefly to describe tlie methods of suturing the stomach and intestine, and certain operations which are performed on the stomach. Sutures. — In closing wounds in the stomach or bowel, and in uniting di- vided ends of in- testine, the sutures must be inserted in such a way as to pre- vent leakage of the intestinal contents into the peritoneal cavity. To ensure this the edges of the wound should be in- vaginated so that the mucous mem- brane is turned to- wards the lumen of the tube, and the serous surfaces on either side are brought into close apposition in order that they may adhere firmly to one another. The best material to employ is the finest Chinese-twist silk, and the stitches should be introduced with a round needle, which may be straight or curved as preferred. A milliner’s needle suits the purpose admirably. Fm. 79.—Lcmbert’s Suture, interrupted —- a, Sutures inserted ; b, Sutures tied.

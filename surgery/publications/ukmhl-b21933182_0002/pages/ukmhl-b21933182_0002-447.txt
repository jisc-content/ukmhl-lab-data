427 INTUSSUSCEPTION. untwisted has been recorded more than once ; to prevent it, the mesocolon may be stitched to the parietal peritoneum—colopexy. There is no tendency to relapse when an artificial anus has been temporarily established because of the adhesions which result. Intussusception.—This is one of the commonest forms of intestinal obstruction, and may be defined as the invagination of one part of the intestine into the lumen of the immediately adjoining part. An in- tussusception forms a solid, sausage - shaped tumour composed of three concentrically arranged tubes of bowel which are differentiated as follows : an internal, known as the entering tube; a middle, known as the returning tube; and an external, known as the sheath, receiving tube or intus- suscipiens. The middle and internal tubes to- gether constitute the in- vaginated portion or intussusception. The highest part, where the returning tube joins the sheath, is known as the neck, the lowest part, where the middle and inner tubes join, as the apex. The three concentric tubes of bowel are well seen in a transverse section of an intussusception, and they are so arranged that mucous membrane is always in contact with mucous mem- brane, and peritoneum with peritoneum. Varieties.—The commonest variety, at least in children, is the ileo-ccecal, in which the ileum and caecum are invaginated into the colon, and the ileo-csecal valve forms the apex of the intruding portion. For its occurrence, the colon must be considerably larger than the ileum, and must also be unduly movable, so that it readily allows itself to be invaginated when once the process has begun.

SUBPHRENIC ABSCESS. 339 the abscess. If the abscess project below the costal margin anteriorly, it is opened from the front; in the majority of cases the trans-pleural route, similar to that employed for hepatic abscess, must be employed, and it yields the most efficient drainage. In isolated cases the abscess is behind the liver, for example, where it has originated from the appendix or right kidney, and it may be possible to reach it by making an incision below the twelfth rib, and then working upwards between the liver and the diaphragm. Even under favourable conditions subphrenic abscess is attended with a mortality of about 40 per cent. If the patient recover, the question of interfering with the diseased organ from which the abscess originated may require to be considered.

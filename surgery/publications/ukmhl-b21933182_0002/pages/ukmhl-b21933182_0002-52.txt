THE CRANIUM AND ITS CONTENTS. 32 Operation has also proved beneficial in some cases of Jacksonian epilepsy in which there was no history of injury. Traumatic insanity may follow brain injuries, either im- mediately or after an interval. It may or may not be associated with epilepsy. Any form of insanity, except perhaps general paralysis of the insane, may occur. Cases occurring within a few days of the injury usually recover within a month or two. The later the condition is in developing, the worse is the prognosis. Surgical treatment by trephining has not been conspicuously successful. After severe head injuries the patient’s whole mental attitude is sometimes changed, so that he becomes irritable, unstable, and incapacitated for brain work. In some cases self-control is lost, and alcoholic and drug habits are developed. Meningitis, sinus thrombosis, and cerebral abscess may follow upon any form of head injury. The clinical features—save for the history of a traumatism—correspond so closely with those of the same conditions occurring apart from injury, that they are considered together.

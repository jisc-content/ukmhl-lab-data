106 CHAPTER VIII. DEVIATIONS OF THE SPINAL COLUMN. Scoliosis : Varieties—Kypliosis : Varieties—Lordosis. Three deviations of the spinal column are here described :— Scoliosis, or lateral deviation, in which the spine is arched to one side of the middle line ■ Kyphosis, in which it is unduly arched backwards; and Lordosis, in which it is unduly arched forwards. Scoliosis. — The term scoliosis is applied to a persistent lateral deviation of the spinal column with rotation of the individual vertebral around a vertical axis. Various forms are met with, that which occurs during adolescence being the most common. Scoliosis of Adolescents.—Causes.—In some cases there is a distinct hereditary tendency to scoliosis, and several members of a family may be affected in succeeding generations. The deformity is most frequently met with in rapidly-growing, anaemic, or chlorotic girls, who are overworked at school and lead a sedentaxy indoor life. In many cases the development of the scoliosis is coincident with the onset of menstruation. In some it is associated with respiratory obstruction from the presence of adenoids in the naso-pharynx. The free play of the chest is also liable to be interfered with in girls of this age by tight-fitting garments. In such debilitated subjects the muscular system is weak, and the muscles of the back fail to take their proper share in maintaining the spine erect. The normal ossification of the vertebrae is also interfered with, and the solidity of the vertebral column is therefore defective, with the result that the spine bends under the weight of the body. The patient is easily fatigued, and to rest the muscles and relieve the feeling of tiredness in the back is apt to assume easy and ungainly attitudes.

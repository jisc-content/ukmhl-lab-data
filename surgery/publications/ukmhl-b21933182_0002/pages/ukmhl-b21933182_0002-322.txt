When the tumour is near the centre of the breast, it causes retraction of the nipple by dragging on the large ducts. Glandular infection may take place at any time in the course of the disease. In many cases, and particularly in fat women, the glands cannot be palpated through the skin even although they are enlarged. Gland- ular enlargement is usually most marked in ulcerating cancers. The pectoral group are usually the first to become enlarged, later the axillary, the sub - clavicular and the supra-clavic- ular groups are in- fected. In course of time the enlargement and matting together of the axillary glands, by obstructing the lymph flow and pressing on the large veins, leads to great Fig. 63.—Advanced Ulcerating Cancer of Breast, swelling of the upper ■with extensive involvement of the Lymphatics, extremity (Fig. 63). causing elephantiasis of the arm. The nerve trunks also (Mr. Annandale’s case.) pressed Upon and severe pain results. Course and Terminations.—If left untreated, the tumour infiltrates the skin, and may ulcerate through it, forming an irregular, excavated ulcer with an indurated base and raised and everted edges—the crateriform ulcer. The discharge from such an ulcer is thin and watery, and may become foetid and offensive. At the same time the tumour invades the retro- mammary fat and becomes adherent to the pectoral fascia and muscles of the chest wall, producing the characteristic fixation of the breast. Occasionally a tumour develops in the opposite

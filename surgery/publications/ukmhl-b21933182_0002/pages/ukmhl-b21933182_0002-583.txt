PYONEPHROSIS. 5G3 Treatment is usually confined to the relief of symptoms. The kidneys are flushed by administering diluted milk, Contrexeville and barley water, and urinary decomposition retarded by such drugs as urotropin. It was formerly believed that the condition was always bilateral and beyond relief by surgical means, but Israel has shown that the lesion may be confined to one kidney, and that incision or removal of this organ may be followed by re- covery. Pyonephrosis may be defined as that form of suppuration in the kidney and its pelvis which is associated with ob- struction to the outflow of urine. It represents, there- fore, a combination of fection and retention. It is met with as a sequel to hydronephrosis-—“in- fected hydronephrosis ”; and as a sequel of stone in the pelvis of the kidney—“cal- culous pyonephrosis.” In these the infection is usually derived from the blood, and the affected organ may attain l1 ig.129.

In all of these the resulting pyonephrosis is usually bilateral, although it is frequently more advanced on one side. The infection is commonly an ascending one, taking place by way of the ureter and favoured by the increased backward pressure (Fig. 129). As a result of chronic inflammation, the walls of the ureter

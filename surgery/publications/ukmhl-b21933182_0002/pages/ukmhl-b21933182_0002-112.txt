Upper Cervical Region, including Atlo-axoid Disease.— In the upper cervical region the disease usually begins in the vicinity of the atlo-axoid articulation, and from the softening of the component bones and ligaments there is a tendency for the atlas to become dis- located forward so that the odontoid process impinges on the medulla and upper part of the cord causing sudden death. If, on the other hand, recovery ensues, the atlas and axis usually become anky- losed. Clinical Features. — The patient complains of a fixed pain in the back of the neck, and of radiating pains along the course of the sub-occipital and other cervical nerves. The neck is held rigid, and to look to the side the patient turns his whole body round. As the disease advances the head may be bent to one side as in wry-neck, or the head of the neck is due to a retro-pharyngeal may be retracted and the abscess. chin protruded. To take the weight of the head off the diseased vertebrae the patient often supports the chin on the hands (Fig. 17). An abscess may form between the vertebrae and the wall of the pharynx (retro-pharyngeal abscess). The pus accumulates between the diseased bones and the prevertebral layer of the cervical fascia. The abscess may project towards the pharynx as a soft fluctuating swelling, and -may cause difficulty in swallowing and breathing, and snoring during sleep. If it bursts internally it may cause suffocation. The abscess may Fig. 17.—Attitude of Patient suffering from Tuberculous Diseaseof tlie Cervical The swelling on the left side

When the passage of the stomach-tube causes much discomfort, the patient is fed by the rectum. Wounds of the thoracic duct have been described with affections of the lymphatics, and wounds of the brachial plexus with injuries of individual nerves. Inflammatory Affections. Diffuse suppurative cellulitis may occur in any of the cellular planes in the neck. When situated in the subcutaneous connective tissue, it is usually the result of infection of an operation or accidental wound, and is, as a rule, comparatively limited in extent. When it occurs under the cervical fascia, for example, in the course of acute infective diseases, such as scarlet fever, measles or general pyaemia, the pus tends to spread widely throughout the neck, infiltrating the connective tissue spaces around the blood-vessels, the air-passages and the oesophagus. The density and tension of the cervical fascia cause the pus to burrow downwards towards the mediastinal spaces of the thorax, where it may give rise to such complications as empyema, septic peri- carditis or gangrene of the lung. In some cases the pus reaches the axilla by spreading along the blood-vessels. A particularly virulent form — sometimes spoken of as Ludwig’s angina—is met with in debilitated subjects as a result of infection of the cellular tissue of the neck with streptococci, which are usually derived from some septic focus about the floor of the mouth. Clinical Features.-—In all forms the process spreads rapidly, and the tissues of the neck become swollen, cedematous and of a dusky red colour. The accumulation of inflammatory products under the dense cervical fascia renders the whole neck indurated and brawny. The neck is flexed towards the affected side, and there is pain on attempting to move the head and on palpating the swelling. Pus forms early, but, as it is under great tension, fluctuation can seldom be detected. Respiration may be interfered with by the inflammatory products exerting pressure on the air-passages, or by the onset of oedema of the glottis, and tracheotomy may be urgently called for on account of dyspnoea. Swallowing may also be affected by pressure on the pharynx and oesophagus.

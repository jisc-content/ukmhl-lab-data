PYOGENIC DISEASES.1 The diseases resulting from infection of the cranial contents by pyogenic bacteria are meningitis, ' encephalitis, cerebral abscess, and phlebitis of the large venous sinuses. The organisms most frequently found in these conditions are the staphylococcus aureus and the streptococcus. It is not un- common, however, to meet with mixed infections in which other bacteria are present—for example, the pneumococcus, the bacillus foetidus, and the bacillus pyocyaneus. By far the most common source of intra-cranial infection is chronic suppuration of the middle ear and mastoid antrum. The organisms may pass from these cavities to the interior of the skull directly through a perforation of the tegmen tympani or of the wall of the sigmoid groove, or they may be carried in the blood-stream by way of the emissary veins. Infection is believed to have travelled in some cases along the sheath of the facial and auditory nerves. Among other sources of infection may be mentioned septic wounds of the scalp, infective diseases of the head and neck— such as, for example, erysipelas, anthrax, boils, and carbuncles— and septic conditions of the nasal cavity and its accessory air 1 We desire here to acknowledge our indebtedness to Sir William Macewen’s work on Pyogenic Infective Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord.

THE PERITONEUM. 336 left side. In a certain proportion of cases the pus accumulates in the cellular tissue behind the peritoneum, but in the majority it is intra-peritoneal, the general peritoneal cavity having been previously shut off by adhesions. The abscess is usually situated on the same side of the body as the organ from which the original infection proceeded. Abscess on the right side (Fig. 64), for example, most often originates from lesions of the liver, bile- ducts, vermiform appendix, or right kidney, or from infective Fig. 64.â€”Diagram of Subphrenic Abscess on right side, displacing the diaphragm and liver. conditions of the right pleural cavity or thoracic wall; while abscess on the left side (Fig. 65) results from lesions of the stomach, left pleura, or left thoracic wall. The abscess may contain pus only, or a combination of pus and gas; the gas may be derived from the perforation of a hollow organ, such as the stomach, or, as is more frequently the case, it is formed within the abscess itself as a result of bacterial decomposition. The subphrenic abscess which follows upon lesions of the vermiform appendix is practically always right-sided, and it may be extra- or intra-peritoneal. The extra-peritoneal abscess

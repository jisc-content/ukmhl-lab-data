APPENDICITIS. 354 edges are drawn aside; the transversalis fascia and peritoneum are divided in the line of the external oblique, and these edges are drawn aside. This method of opening the belly was suggested by M‘Burney, with the object of preventing ventral hernia, and is known as the “gridiron method.” The caecum is identified and partially pulled out at the wound ; the anterior longitudinal band is traced down to the root of the appendix, and the latter is divided close to the caecum between two pressure forceps. The exposed mucous membrane is destroyed with pure carbolic acid or with the cautery. The stump of the appendix is ligatured, and invaginated into the caecum by means of a purse-string suture. The caecum is then replaced. The appendix, still held at its root by the pressure forceps, is enucleated from its mesenteric and adventitious attachments, each segment of tissue containing blood-vessels being seized before division and subsequently ligatured. The meso-appendix is ligatured with the help of an aneurysm needle before being cut. If the appendix is firmly adherent to a coil of intestine much care must be exercised, and in some cases it will be safer to leave a thin layer of the serous coat of the appendix attached to the intestine than to run any risk of injuring the wall of the gut. The abdominal wall is then reconstituted by suturing in layers. The patient may be allowed up at the end of a fort- night or three weeks.

151 TUMOURS OF INFERIOR MAXILLA. Fig. 41.—Osseous Shell of Myeloma of Lower Jaw. (From Professor Annandale’s collection.) submaxillary salivary gland and the cervical lymphatic glands are usually implicated, and the disease tends to spread by metastasis to distant parts. Epitheliomaia the commonest tumour affecting the lower jaw. It is usually secondary to cancer of the lip, tongue or floor of the mouth, of which it constitutes a serious complica- tion. Treatment. —Partial removal of the lower jaw may be under- taken in cases of myeloma, and in certain cases of sarcoma and epithelioma when the tumour is limited to a small area of the bone—for example, to the alve- olar process, the angle, the horizontal ramus, or the sym- physis. In very small tumours it is possible to perform the opera- tion through the mouth, but in most cases an external incision is indispensable. When practic- able, the arch of the jaw should be left intact by conserving the lower border of the bone. If this cannot be done with safety, the integrity of the arch should be maintained temporarily by means of a simple wire splint or other suitable apparatus. Later a plate bearing artificial teeth is fitted by the dentist. Removal of one-half of the lower jaw is called for in the majority of cases of malignant tumour. An in- cision is made through the lower lip, in the middle line, beginning just below the red margin, and is carried down to the chin, then along the lower border of the bone as far as the angle, and up behind the ascending ramus to a little below the lobule of the ear, stopping short The facial artery as it crosses the jaw in front of the masseter is caught with forceps before being cut. The masseter and buccinator muscles having been separated from the bone, the flap is thrown up, the reflection of the mucous Fig. 42.—Sarcoma of Lower Jaw removed by Syme.

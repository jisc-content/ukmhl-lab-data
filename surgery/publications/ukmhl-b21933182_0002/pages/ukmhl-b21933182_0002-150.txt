130 THE FACE, ORBIT, AND LIPS. food. The growth is very liable to spread to the lower jaw. Secondary deposits occur early in the sub-mental and sub-maxillary glands, but metastasis to internal organs is rare. Unless removed by operation the disease usually proves fatal in from three to three and a half years. The treatment consists in early and free removal of the tumour and the infected glands. In comparatively small growths which do not involve the angle of the mouth, a Y-shaped incision is carried through the entire thickness of the lip so as to include the tumour, and an area of healthy tissue beyond it. In larger growths, particularly when situated at the angle of the mouth, it is necessary to carry an incision transversely into the cheek to enable the lip to be repaired without leaving deformity. When it is necessary to remove the greater part of the lower lip, the defect may be filled up by flaps of skin taken from below the jaw (Symeâ€™s operation). When the tumour is adherent to the lower jaw, it is necessary to resect a portion of that bone along with the lip. The frequency with which recurrence takes place in the lymphatic glands below the jaw renders it advisable to remove these in all cases, whether they are palpably enlarged or not.

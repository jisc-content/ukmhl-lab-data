The protrusion, either externally or towards the thorax, of any of the abdominal contents from the cavity of the abdomen is spoken of as a hernia. When the protruded organ is bowel or omentum, the term hernia is applied without qualification, but when any other viscus is present in the protrusion, such terms as “ hernia of the liver,” “ hernia of the bladder,” “ hernia of the stomach,” and so on, are employed. The popular term rupture is misleading, as a hernia is nearly always of slow formation, and is not attended with tearing of tissue. In describing a hernia it is customary to refer to its sac, its contents, and its coverings. The sac is derived from the parietal peritoneum, and in acquired hernia is at first represented by a mere laxity or bulging of the peritoneum. Later, at one point a dimple is formed, which gradually deepens and becomes elongated into a tube-like process which lies between the layers of the abdominal wall. As this tube-like structure becomes elongated it gradually reaches the subcutaneous tissue, and there, relieved of pressure, expands and becomes spherical or pyriform in shape. To some extent the increase in length of the sac may be due to a gliding or displacement of the peritoneum, but it is chiefly the result of gradual stretching of the serous membrane. The upper end or narrow portion of the sac is known as the neck, the expanded lower end as the fundus. The sac may present an hour-glass shape, or may be multilocular from the forma-

THE TONGUE. 166 healing. It may at any time take on the characters of a malignant ulcer. Syphilitic fissures are met with as long, narrow, deep clefts, or as stellate or sinuous cracks in the substance of the tongue. After the healing of these ulcers and fissures permanent clefts and furrows remain. Treatment.—The tertiary manifestations of syphilis in the tongue are treated on the same general lines as other tertiary lesions. Locally, the use of antiseptic mouth-washes, such as chlorate of potash or black wash diluted with lime-water, the insufflation of powdered iodoform and borax with a small quantity of morphin, or the application of mer- curial ointment is useful. The sore must be thoroughly cleansed before these reme- dies are applied. Tumours. Carcinoma is by far the most common form of new growth met with in the tongue, and it is almost in- variably a squamous-celled epithelioma. Epithelioma generally oc- curs between the ages of forty and sixty, and attacks males oftener than females, in the proportion of about six to one. Its development is favoured by any long-continued irritation, such as the rubbing of the tongue against a carious tooth, an ill-fitting tooth-plate, or the rough end of a clay pipe. Chronic superficial glossitis, syphilitic fissures or scars, and chronic ulcers also act as predisposing factors. The repeated application of strong caustics to chronic inflammatory conditions of the tongue is, according to Butlin, an important determining cause of cancer. The disease is usually situated on the anterior half of the tongue, and more commonly on the edge than on the dorsum. The disease may begin as an indolent excoriation, ulcer or fissure, as a warty growth, particularly in association with a patch of Fig. 46.—Epithelioma of Tongue wliicli supervened on chronic superficial glos- sitis of many years’ standing.

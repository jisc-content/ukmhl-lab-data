115 HARE LIP AND CLEFT PALATE. maxillary bone, and the septum of the nose. The second form is usually associated with cleft palate. Lateral hare-lip is much more common. It is due to imperfect fusion of the mesial nasal process with the labial plates of the maxillary process. There may be a cleft only on one side of the lip, or the con- dition may be bilateral. In some cases the cleft merely extends into the soft parts of the lip—simple hare-lip (Fig. 29), forming a notch with rounded margins on which the red edge of the lip shows al- most to'the apex. In other Fig. 29.—Simple Hare-lip cases the cleft passes into the alveolus of the jaw—alveolar hare-lip—partially or completely separating the inner and outer segments of the premaxillary bone. These cases are usually combined with cleft palate (Fig. 30). When the hare-lip is bilateral, the two clefts may be unequal, one forming a simple notch in the lip, the other passing into the nostril. In most cases, however, both clefts are complete,and the mesial portion of the lip is entirely separated from the lateral portions. The central portion or prolabium is usually Fig. 30.—Unilateral Hare-lip with Cleft Alveolus, smaller than normal, and is closely adherent to the premaxillary bone. This bone may retain its normal position in line with the alveolar processes of the upper jaw

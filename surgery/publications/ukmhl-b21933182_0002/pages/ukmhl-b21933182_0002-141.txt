DEFORMITIES OF THE FACE. 121 tissue. In incised wounds the bleeding is usually very free at first, but unless one of the larger arteries, such as the facial or temporal, is injured, it soon ceases. The facial, supra-orbital, and infra-orbital nerves are liable to be injured, causing paralysis or loss of sensation. In wounds of the cheek Stenson’s duct may be damaged and a salivary fistula result. Contused and lacerated wounds frequently result from ex- plosions and injuries by firearms, and foreign bodies may lodge in the tissues. Owing to the extreme vascularity of the tissues sloughing seldom occurs, even when the parts are severely damaged. Ligatures are seldom necessary for the arrest of haemorrhage unless the larger branches are injured, as the bleeding from smaller twigs is arrested by the sutures. Every effort should be made to remove foreign bodies, such as particles of stone or coal, or grains of gunpowder and small shot, as these, if left embedded in the tissues, cause unsightly pigmentation of the skin. The edges of the wound are ap- proximated by a series of in- terrupted horse-hair stitches. A fine Hagedorn needle is to be preferred, as it leaves less mark than the ordinary bayonet-shaped needle. If the mucous membrane of the mouth is implicated, its edges should be approximated by a separate row of stitches introduced from the inside. The complications of face wounds, such, for example, as erysipelas, secondary haemorrhage, cephalic tetanus, are attribut- able to septic infection. Cicatricial contraction after severe burns of the face may lead to marked deformities of the eyelids, mouth, and nose. When the burn has implicated the neck, the chin may be drawn towards the chest, and the movements of the lower jaw and head seriously impeded (Fig. 33).

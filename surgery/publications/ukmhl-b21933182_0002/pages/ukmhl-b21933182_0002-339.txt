Peritonitis. The term peritonitis is applied to any inflammation of the serous membrane resulting from the presence of an irritant, and the changes observed in the membrane are to be regarded as representing the reaction of its tissue elements to the irritant. “Aseptic Peritonitis.”—When the irritant is of a mechanical or chemical nature, or is produced by attenuated organisms which are readily overcome by the tissues, the changes in the peritoneum are essentially reparative, and the resulting peritonitis may be considered a salutary process. Such changes constitute what has been termed “aseptic or reparative peritonitis,” and consist in the exudation of fibrinous lymph which is either reabsorbed, or else leads to the formation of adhesions between opposing surfaces of peritoneum. For example, when blood is extravasated into the peritoneal cavity, it may be entirely reabsorbed, or its presence may cause a certain degree of irritation of the peritoneum which results in the encapsulation of the blood, and the formation of a blood-cyst. When normal bile escapes from a rupture of the gall-bladder it may be reabsorbed, or may cause a reaction on the part of the peritoneum which results in the formation of adhesions. Similar phenomena may follow upon the rupture of an ovarian cyst. Aseptic peritonitis may also be observed as a result of circulatory dis-

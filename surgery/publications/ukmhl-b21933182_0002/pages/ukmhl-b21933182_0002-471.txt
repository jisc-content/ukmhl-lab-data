On the other hand, if a suppurating channel or abscess cavity intervene between the bowel and the parietes, the fistula is lined by granulation tissue (Fig. 103). AED, WALL MESENTERY Fig. 102.—Frecal Fistula of Small Intestine. The clinical features vary with the distance of the fistula from the normal anus, with the proportion of intestinal con- tents which escapes, and with the nature of the lesion to which the fistula owes its origin. Fistula; in the colon discharge frecal matter, and if this be solid or semi-solid, as it usually is beyond the hepatic flexure, its escape is more or less under the control of a pad and bandage. The discharge from a fistula in the small intestine is fluid, and is composed of partially digested food material mixed with the various secretions discharged into the bowel, its appearance, chemical charac- ters and nutritive value vary- ing with the level of the fistula. If it is situated in the upper part of the jejunum, the loss of nutriment may cause rapid emaciation, and terminate in death by starvation. The fluid, moreover, is extremely irritat- ing, and causes superficial ulceration of the surrounding skin.

The loss or gain in weight affords the most reliable information regarding the influence of the fistula on the nutrition and

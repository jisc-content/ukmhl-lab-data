TEMPORO - SPHENOIDAL ABSCESS. 49 leg centre In making a diagnosis, examination of the ear, as to the character and amount of discharge, and the condition of the membrana tympani and middle ear, must never be neglected. Terminal Stage.—If left to itself, a cerebral abscess usually ends fatally by causing gradually increasing stupor and coma, or by bursting, either into the ventricles or into the subarachnoid space, and setting up a diffuse purulent lepto-meningitis. Symptoms of Abscess bursting into the Ventricles.—When this happens, the patient suddenly becomes much worse, and dies within a few hours. “ The pupils become widely dilated, the face livid, the respiration greatly hurried, and either shallow or stertorous. The temperature rises within a few hours with a bound from subnormal to 104° or 105° F. ; the pulse from 40 or 50 per minute quickly reaches 120 and over. There are muscular twitchings all over the body, possibly as- sociated with convulsions and tetanic seizures, and these are followed by coma and speedy death ” (Macewen).

Small abscesses in this lobe may produce no localising symptoms. Those of large size may press indirectly on the motor cortex, the fibres passing through the internal capsule, or on individual cranial nerves. It is important to observe the order in which paralysis of the opposite side of the body comes on. When it begins in the face and passes successively to the arm and leg, the pressure is on the cortical centres. When the paralysis progresses in the VOL. II—4

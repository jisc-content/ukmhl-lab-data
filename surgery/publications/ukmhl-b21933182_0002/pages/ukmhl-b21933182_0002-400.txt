HERNIA. 380 the sac. The umbilical scar, stretched and bulging, is usually seen on the lower half of the swelling. Large hernise become pendulous, and hang down over the pubes (Fig. 75). The expansile impulse on coughing is very decided. Over the convexity of the tumour the coverings of the sac are usually very thin, and the skin may become the seat of eczema or of ulceration. Umbilical liernke, when they have attained any considerable size, are nearly always irreducible because of adhesions between the sac and its contents, and also because of the mere bulk of the pro- trusion and the accumula- tion of fat in the herniated omentum. The patient complains of a sense of heaviness and dragging in the swelling, and there may be pain and tender- ness as a result of local peritonitis. Obstruction of the prolapsed loop of bowel is more often met with than in any other form of hernia; it is characterised by attacks of flatulence, vomiting and constipation, and may insidiously merge into a condition of strang- ulation. These attacks are erroneously inter - preted by the patient as “bilious attacks,” and as having nothing to do with the hernia, and in this way they often escape medical observation. Treatment.—When the hernia is small and reducible, the best support is obtained from a well-made abdominal belt provided with a large, round vulcanite shield to cover the umbilical area. In addition, careful attention is paid to the diet and the bowels, and to any cause of increased abdominal pressure. An endeavour should be made to reduce the amount of adipose tissue. If the hernia is irreducible, the patient should be confined to bed, the foot of which is elevated, and the bowels should be thoroughly emptied by enemata. Should the irreducibility persist, the alternative lies between supporting the hernia by means of an

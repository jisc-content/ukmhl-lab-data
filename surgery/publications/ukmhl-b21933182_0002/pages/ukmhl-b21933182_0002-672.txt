THE MALE GENITAL ORGANS. 652 to the rapidity of healing plastic operations or skin grafting are seldom called for. Eczema and prurigo of the scrotum, perineum, and thighs are sometimes induced by urine dribbling over the parts in children, and in elderly patients suffering from incontinence of urine or from urinary fistulas. A chronic form of eczema frequently affects the scrotum in chimney sweepers and in paraffin workers, and is liable to become the starting-point of cancer. Elephantiasis of the scrotum is common among natives in certain tropical countries, but is rarely met with in Europeans. The condition is due to cedema and over- growth of the skin and subcutaneous connective tissue. It usually follows upon repeated attacks of erysipelat- ous inflammation, causing obstruction of the lymphatics of the scrotum. In many cases the lymphatic obstruction is attributable to the presence in the vessels of the filaria sanguinis hominis. The extent to which the scrotum may become enlarged is illus- trated in Fig. 119. The only treatment is by Fie. 14.9.—Tropical Elephantiasis of the Scrotum iu a Native of Samoa. moval of the growth. The penis and testes are isolated by dissection, an elastic ligature is applied round the base of the scrotum to control haemorrhage, and the hypertrophied tissue removed. In the condition known as lymph-scrotum the lymphatics are dilated and varicose, the scrotum becomes enlarged and nodular, and from its surface there oozes at intervals a milky fluid com- posed of lymph and chyle. (Edema of the scrotum is often met with in general dropsy from cardiac or renal disease. When the oedema spreads to the penis this organ may assume a peculiar twisted appearance—the “ ram’s horn penis ”—and the passage of urine may be impeded. Scrotal fistulse and sinuses are usually due to the bursting of abscesses in connection with stricture of the urethra, or with tuberculous disease of the testis.

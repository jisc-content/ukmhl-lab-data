140 THE MOUTH, FAUCES, AND PHARYNX. projection, which is soft and fluctuating, and is usually asym- metrical, may be recognised by digital examination. Sometimes the voice is lost, and the patient has severe attacks of choking â€”symptoms which have led to the disease being mistaken for membranous laryngitis. In some cases a soft swelling is palpable on one or on both sides of the neck. Unless promptly treated the condition usually proves fatal. The treatment consists in incising the abscess. The mouth is opened by meansv of a gag, the head allowed to hang over the end of the table, and the abscess incised, with a guarded bistoury, through the wall of the pharynx. The dangers associated with opening the abscess from the mouth appear to have been exaggerated. _ A less acute form of retro-pharyngeal abscess sometimes develops in the course of chronic middle-ear disease, the in- flammatory process spreading along the Eustachian tube, in the wall of which an abscess forms and burrows into the retro- pharyngeal space. The symptoms are the same as in the other varieties.

541 METHODS OF EXAMINATION. The ureter lies behind, and is closely adherent to the peritoneum covering the psoas muscle. It descends almost vertically about an inch and a half from the mesial plane, and dips into the pelvis in front of the termination of the common iliac artery, two fingers’ breadths above a point where a line between the anterior superior iliac spines cuts a vertical line from the spine of the pubes. The renal blood vessels enter at the hilum, the vein lying in front of the artery. The ureter lies behind the vessels. The lymphatics pass from the hilum to the retro- peritoneal lumbar glands.

160 CHAPTER XII. THE TONGUE. Wounds—Inflammatory Affections : Acute parenchymatous glossitis and hemi-glossitis; Mercurial glossitis; Gangrene; Chronic superficial glossitis: Leucoplakia ; Smoker's patch — Tuberculous disease ; Syphilitic affections: Primary sore; Secondary lesions; Tertiary lesions: Sclerosing glossitis; Gummata; Ulcers and fissures— Tumours: Carcinoma; Sarcoma; Innocent tumours ; Cysts—Thyro- glossal cysts and tumours—Malformations : Absence ; Bifid tongue ; Tongue tie; Excessive length of frenum; Macroglossia-—Nervous Affections. Wounds of the tongue are most commonly produced by the teeth, as, for instance, when a child falls on the chin with the tongue protruded, or when a patient bites his tongue during an epileptic fit, Less frequently a foreign body, such as a pipe- stem, a bullet or a displaced tooth, is driven into the tongue. The immediate risk of such injuries is haemorrhage, particularly when the posterior part of the tongue is implicated and the wound penetrates deeply. In superficial wounds of the anterior part the bleeding is seldom serious, except in haemophilics. Of the later complications sepsis and secondary haemorrhage are the most serious, and the risk is greatest when a foreign body is embedded in the tongue. Treatment.—The haemorrhage should be arrested, a general or local anaesthetic being employed if necessary. In super- ficial wounds near the tip the oozing is efficiently arrested by sutures. In deeper wounds, and especially if they implicate the posterior part of the tongue, a ligature must be applied to the bleeding vessel. Ligature of the lingual artery in the neck is seldom called for. Secondary haemorrhage is much more difficult to arrest on account of the friable state of the tissues, and it may be necessary to ligature the lingual, or even the external carotid in the neck.'

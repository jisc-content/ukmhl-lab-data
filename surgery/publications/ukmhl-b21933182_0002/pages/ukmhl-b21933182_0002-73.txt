If on palpation the sinus feels firm and tense, it is probably occupied by a disintegrating thrombus, and this should be removed by opening the vessel. To enable this to be done efficiently it is necessary to expose at least an inch of the sinus. The septic material having been removed, the cavity is purified and stuffed with iodoform gauze. Should haemorrhage occur, it is readily controlled by the pressure of a pad of gauze. With the object of preventing the dissemination of septic material, Horsley recommends that a ligature should be applied to the internal jugular vein in the neck before the sinus is opened. If the phlebitis is ac- companied by cerebral ab- scess or meningitis, these conditions are of course treated at the same time. Operative interference is seldom feasible in phlebitis of the longitudinal or cavernous sinuses. Hernia Cerebri.—This term is applied to a pro- trusion of brain substance through an acquired open- ing in the skull and dura mater. Such an opening may be the result of a com- pound fracture, a gunshot Pm- 10.—Hernia Cerebri after operation for wound, or a surgical opera- cerebral abscess. The patient recovered. tion. The protrusion is (Mr. J. M. Cotterill’s case.) essentially due to increased intra-cranial tension, which increased tension may result from the presence of a tumour within the cranium, or may be associ- ated with septic infection of the brain and its membranes. Other things being equal, a hernia is more likely to occur through a small than through a large opening in the skull. When the increased tension inside the skull is due to the growth of an irremovable tumour, much relief of pain and other pressure symptoms usually follows the development of a hernia cerebri. In such cases the removal of a large segment of bone to admit of the brain expanding is an operation which often affords great relief to the patient.

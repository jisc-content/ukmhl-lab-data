104 DISEASES OF THE SPINE AND COED. or ribs, or engrafted from animals. The soft parts are sutured in successive layers, and the patient is kept in the prone position till the wound heals. The immediate results of this operation are usually satis- factory, but in a majority of cases the patient subsequently develops hydrocephalus which may prove fatal. The method of injecting the sac with iodine, as first recom- mended by Morton of Glasgow, has been almost entirely given up. The term spina bifida occulta is applied to a condition in which there is no pro- trusion of the spinal con- tents although the verte- bral arches are deficient. The skin over the gap in the bone is often puckered and adherent, and is fre- quently covered with a growth of coarse hair. A mass of fat may project towards the sur- face, and when situated in the lumbo-sacral region may suggest a caudal ap- pendage or tail (Fig. 25). The clinical import- ance of spina bifida oc- culta lies in the fact that it is sometimes associated with nerve symptoms re- ferable to the lower limbs and the sphincters. Trophic sores may also be present. In some cases these symptoms have been relieved by the removal of a mass of fat from the gap in the vertebral arches. Congenital Sacro - coccygeal Tumours.—Many varieties of congenital tumours are met with in the region of the sacrum and coccyx. The majority are developed in relation to the communication which exists in the embryo between the neural canal and the alimentary tract—the post-anal gut or neurenteric canal. This canal usually becomes completely obliterated in the course of development, leaving no trace of its existence. It is not uncommon, however, for a shallow depression to be left over the tip of the coccyx—the post-anal dimple. Sometimes a dermoid cyst containing a tuft of hair, and less frequently an Fig. 25.—Tail-like Appendage over Spina Bilida Occulta.

THE MOUTH. Stomatitis.—The term stomatitis is applied to any inflammation of the buccal mucous membrane. Several varieties are recog- nised. The simplest is catarrhal stomatitis, a condition in which the mucous membrane is hypersemic and swollen, and exudes an excessive amount of viscid mucous secretion. Vesicles form, and the epithelium desquamates in patches, leaving small super- ficial erosions or ulcers which are very sensitive. This condition is of septic origin, and is often associated with the presence of carious teeth or an infected wound. The aphthous form of stomatitis is liable to supervene on the catarrhal form in unhealthy underfed children. It is charac- terised by the occurrence of patches of fibrinous exudation into the superficial layers of the mucous membrane. The epithelium covering these patches is shed, and leaves a series of whitish spots, raised above the surface of the inflamed mucous membrane, and surrounded by a red hypersemic zone. These spots may become confluent and form small ulcers. The condition known as thrush closely resembles aphthous stomatitis. It is met with in infants during the period of teething, and is due to the oidium albicans, a fungus met with in sour milk. The spots, which are most numerous on the lips, tongue, and throat, have the appearance of curdled milk. The treatment of these forms of stomatitis consists in improving the general condition of the patient, and in employing an anti- septic mouth-wash, such as peroxide of hydrogen, Condy’s fluid,

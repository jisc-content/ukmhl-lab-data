CLOSURE OF THE JAW. 159 nerve. The joint is exposed by clearing away the posterior fibres of the masseter, and the condyle divided by a Gigliâ€™s wire-saw or an osteotome. The attachment of the external pterygoid is then separated and the condyle removed. The meniscus is retained. In some cases these measures are insufficient, and it is necessary to resect the condyle, the coronoid process, and a portion of the ascending ramus. When the fixation is due to cicatricial contraction of the soft parts, mobility is best restored by forming an artificial joint well in front of the cicatricial tissue, as suggested by Esmarch. This is effected by excising a wedge of bone from the lower jaw. The base of the wedge measures about an inch and is towards the lower border of the jaw. To prevent relapse the muscles should be stitched across the gap in the bone, and active and passive movements carried out from the first.

102 DISEASES OF THE SPINE AND CORD. meningocele, in which only the membranes, filled with cerebro- spinal fluid, are protruded. (2) Meningo-myelocele, in which the cord and some of the spinal nerves are protruded, and spread out over the inner aspect of the sac (Fig. 24). (3) Syringo-myelocele, in which there is a dilatation of the central canal in the protruded part of the cord. Meningo-myelocele is the form most commonly met with clinically. In these three forms the protrusion may be covered by healthy skin, or by a thin, smooth, translucent membrane through which the contents are visible. Fre- quently this thin covering sloughs or ulcerates, leaving perforations Fig. 23.—Spina Bifida in Cervical through which cerebro-spinal fluid Region. exudes. (4) The myelocele, in which (Mr. Shaw M'Laren’s case.) tlle skin, as well as the vertebral arches and membranes, is absent, and the cord lies exposed on the surface, and there is a copious escape of cerebro-spinal fluid. jThis form is comparatively common, but as the infants are either dead born or die within a few days of birth, it seldom comes under the notice of the surgeon. Clinical Features.—The pres- ence in the middle line of the back of a swelling which has existed since birth, which contains fluid, and which increases in size and tenseness when the child cries or coughs, renders the diagnosis of spina bifida comparatively easy. The swelling is usually sessile but may be pedunculated. A menin- gocele, as it contains no nerve elements, may be translucent. In FlG- 24,-Meningo-myelocele of a meningo-myelocele the shadows of the cord and nerves stretched out in the sac may be recognised. The presence of the cord is sometimes indicated by a median

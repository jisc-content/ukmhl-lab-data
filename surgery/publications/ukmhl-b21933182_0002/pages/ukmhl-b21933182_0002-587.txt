567 STONE IN THE KIDNEY. ureteral calculus is usually elongated like a date stone, but may become rounded. The channel of the ureter may be obstructed by the stone itself, or obstruction may result from superadded swelling of the mucous membrane and spasm of the muscular coat. Uric and phosphatic stones are not infrequently multiple, and are then usually faceted. Both kidneys are the seat of stone in about one-third of the total cases, and the stones may be of different composition on the two sides. Morbid Anatomy of Calculous Kidney.—In the absence of septic infection the changes in the kidney are the result of mechanical irritation, with or without retention of urine according to the situation of the stone. Fig. 131.—Brandling Uratic Calculus which formed a cast of the pelvis and calyces of the kidney. (Removed by Prof. Annandale.) The irritation induces an increase in the interstitial connective tissue, whereby the organ be- comes tougher and harder, and the fatty and fibrous capsules become thickened and fused with one another, and firmly adherent to the parenchyma. The mucous membrane of the pelvis is injected and swollen, and the stone tends to become buried in the swollen mucous membrane as a result of contraction of the wall of the pelvis. If the stone hinders the outflow from the pelvis hydro- nephrotic changes result, chiefly at the expense of the secreting is rarely any marked increase in size of the of the sclerosis and thickening of the capsules.

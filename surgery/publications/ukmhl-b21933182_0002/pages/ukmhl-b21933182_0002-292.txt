THE CHEST. Surgical Diseases of the Chest. Diseases of the Chest Wall. — Pyogenic inflammations of the ribs and sternum are comparatively rare. They are some- times met with in association with compound fractures, in empyema, and in certain1 general infective diseases, particularly typhoid. Cold Abscess and Sinuses of the Chest Wall.—The chest wall is a common seat of chronic abscess. It may originate from tuberculous disease of the ribs or sternum, from the parietal pleura, or less frequently from the breast or vertebral column. The abscess tends to burrow widely, and to come to the surface at a con- siderable distance from its seat of origin, hence the sinuses which result from the rupture of the abscess are long and tortuous. In some cases the abscess is of an hour-glass shape, one compartment bulging beneath the skin, the other against the parietal pleura, with a narrow communication between them cr’ossing the intercostal space. Similarly in disease of the sternum, pus may accumulate on both aspects of the bone, and the larger accumulation may be found in the anterior mediastinum. These condi- tions are more common in adults than in children, there is little or no im- pairment of health, and the patient complains chiefly of the persistence of discharge and the breaking out of fresh sinuses. The treatment of these conditions is carried out on the same lines as for similar affections elsewhere, but to ensure that all outlying foci of disease are removed, the operation must some- times be very extensive, involving the resection of segments of several ribs or of portions of the sternum. Syphilitic gummata are met with chiefly in the sternum, and require to be differentiated clinically from sarcoma and from tuberculous disease. Tumours.—Simple tumours of the chest wall are compara- tively rare, the subcutaneous lipoma being that most frequently Fig. 59.—Cold Abscess of Cliest Wall originating in Tuber- culous Disease of Ribs.

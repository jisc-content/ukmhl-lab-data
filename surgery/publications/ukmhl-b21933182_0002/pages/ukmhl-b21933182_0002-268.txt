248 THE (ESOPHAGUS. breath becomes very offensive. Eructations of this decomposed material add greatly to the patient’s discomfort. When a diverticulum is present, the patient has a peculiar sense of oppression in the region where the food accumu- lates, and in many cases a distinct swelling can be recognised in the neck after the patient has taken a meal. Pressure over this swelling may cause the food to regurgitate into the mouth. It is sometimes possible to pass one oesophageal tube into the stomach and another into the diverticulum. In several cases the diagnosis has been verified by filling the pouch with a solution containing bismuth and then taking a radiogram, the pouch showing as a dark shadow. Foreign bodies are liable to lodge in the pouch and cause ulceration, and even perforation. Treatment.—The palliative treatment consists in carefully regulating the diet, and in some cases it is advisable to feed the patient through a tube passed into the stomach. The operative treatment consists in excising the diverticulum through an incision in the neck similar to that made for cesophagotomy (Butlin). The oesophagus is closed by Lembert sutures and the external wound drained.

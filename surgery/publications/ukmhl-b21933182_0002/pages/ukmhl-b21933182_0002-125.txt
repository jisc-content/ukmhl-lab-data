105 SACRO-COCCYGEAL TUMOURS. adenoma, develops between the coccyx and the rectum. These tumours may project either towards the surface or towards the bowel. The congenital lipomaâ€”a small, rounded, fatty tumour which often suggests a caudal appendage; the sacral hygroma, which forms a sessile cystic tumour growing over the back of the sacrum, and which is believed to be a meningocele which has become cut off in utero by the continued growth of the spinal arch. Sarcomata, lymphangiomata, and teratomata have also been met with. The treatment consists in removing the tumour if it is causing trouble. From the position of the wound, and the fact that many of these tumours extend into the hollow of the sacrum and therefore necessitate an extensive dissection, there is considerable risk from septic infection, especially in young subjects. The risk is increased when the tumour communicates with the spinal canal.

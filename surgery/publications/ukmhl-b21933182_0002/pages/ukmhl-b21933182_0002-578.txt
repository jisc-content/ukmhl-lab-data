558 THE KIDNEY AND URETER In all cases of hydronephrosis in which the hindrance to the outflow is situated below the pelvic origin of the ureter, the ureter is dilated above the obstruction, and its walls are stretched and lax. Secondary Changes in Hydronephrosis.—The changes in the renal parenchyma are the result of the increased pressure within the pelvis, and consist in compression followed by atrophy; the distension of the pelvis and calyces results in atrophy and dis- placement of the septa between the calyces, until fin- ally there is one large cavity with sacculations corre- sponding to the original calyces (Fig. 128). The renal parenchyma may entirely dis- appear. The contents of the cyst in course of time become poorer and poorer in uri- nary constituents; in a closed hydro- nephrosis of old standing the urea Fio. 128. — Hydronephrosis associated with valvular disappears and a origin of ureter. Removed by lumbar nephrectomy n , ’ from a woman, aged 30, on account of ascending colourless _ serous infection from cystitis. fluid containing a trace of albumin remains. The fluid is sometimes coloured with altered blood pigment derived from antecedent haemorrhages into the sac. In an infected hydronephrosis the fluid is turbid from the presence of pus corpuscles. The clinical features vary according to the nature of the hydronephrosis. The development may be so insidious, for example in those cases depending on malformation of the ureter, that the patient first applies for treatment on account of swell- ing of the abdomen, of a lump in the loin which is discovered accidentally, or of a feeling of weight and pressure, and disturb- ance of the stomach and bowels. A closed hydronephrosis, when of a large size, fills up the

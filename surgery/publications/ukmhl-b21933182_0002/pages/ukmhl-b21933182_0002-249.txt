PARENCHYMATOUS GOITRE. 229 Parenchymatous Goitre. — Etiology. — Nothing definite is known regarding the causation of goitre. The disease is endemic in certain hilly districts in England—particularly Derbyshire and Gloucestershire—and in various parts of Scotland. It is exceedingly common in certain valleys in Switzerland. It is met with less frequently in men than in women, and it occurs chiefly during the child-bearing period of life. The condition has been attributed to a great variety of causes, including peculiarities in the soil, pollution of the drinking-water by decomposing vegetable material or by bacteria, deficiency of certain chemical constituents, particularly iodine, in the water, but the evi- dence on all these points is conflicting. It has also been suggested that the repeated congestion of the thyroid associ- ated, for example, with menstruation and preg- nancy, with severe manual labour in a stooping posture, or with the carrying of weights on the head, lilavs a nart in the production of goitre. In the parenchy- matous variety both the secreting and the fibrous elements of the thyroid undergo hypertrophy, and the gland as a whole becomes enlarged, and forms a horseshoe-shaped swelling of moderate size in the neck. This swelling is soft, smooth or slightly lobulated on the surface, and is seldom quite symmetrical. In some cases the hypertrophy involves chiefly the isthmus. In others an out- lying accessory lobule of thyroid tissue constitutes the bulk of the swelling, and this may extend a considerable distance from the position of the normal thyroid, reaching even behind the sternum into the thorax—intra-thoracic goitre.

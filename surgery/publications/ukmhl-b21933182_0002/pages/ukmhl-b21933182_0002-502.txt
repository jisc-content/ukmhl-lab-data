In exceptional cases the cystic cavity is of the nature of a localised tuberculous Clinical Features.— A pancreatic cyst forms a rounded or oval, fluctuating, and slightly movable abdominal tumour, situated at or above the level of the umbilicus, chiefly to the left of the middle line. The signs on percussion vary with its relation to adjacent organs, but there is usually a central area of dulness sur- rounded by a tympanitic zone. The cyst may extend forwards, and come into relation with the abdominal wall in one or other of three situations (Korte) : (1) It most commonly projects dir- ectly forward, filling the lesser sac of the peritoneum, dis- placing the stomach upwards against the liver, and the trans- verse colon downwards (Fig. 108). (2) The cyst may proj ect forward between the stomach and liver, pushing in front of it the lesser or gastro-liepatic omentum (Fig. 109). (3) The cyst may insinuate itself be- tween the layers of the transverse mesocolon, so that the colon comes to lie directly in front of the cyst (Fig. 110), or above or below it, Fig. 109.—Pancreatic Cyst between Liver and Stomach, and covered in front by Gastro- liepatic Omentum.

88 DISEASES OF THE SPINE AND COED. suppuration ensue, and the destructive process spreads to the adjacent intervertebral discs. In some cases—and particularly in the lumbar region—a distinct sequestrum is formed, either on the surface or in the interior of a vertebra. The pus usually works its way towards the front and sides of the bones, and burrows under the anterior common ligament. Less frequently it spreads towards the spinal canal and accumulates outside the dura, and causes pressure on the cord. The compression of the dis- eased vertebrae by the weight of the body above the seat of the lesion, and by the traction of the muscles pass- ing over it, produces a more or less acute angling of the spinal column. The anterior portions of the bodies being more extensively destroyed, sink in, while the less damaged posterior portions and the intact articular processes pre- vent complete dislocation. In this way the integrity of the spinal canal is maintained, and the cord is protected from pressure by the bones. The spinous processes of the af- fected vertebrae project and form a prominence in the middle line of the back.

The periosteal form of vertebral tuberculosis is that most frequently met with in adults. The disease begins under the periosteum on the front of the vertebrae, and extends along the surface of the bones, causing widespread superficial caries. It may attack the discs at their margins, and spread inwards between the vertebrae. Owing to the comparatively wide area of the spine implicated, this form of the disease is not attended

THE INTESTINES. 414 Various mechanical aids to the union of bowel have been devised with the object of ensuring accurate apposition, and facilitating the intro- duction of the sutures, as well as of maintain- ing the patency of the bowel during the heal- ing process. Of these may be mentioned Murphy’s metal button, and various forms of absorbable buttons and bob- bins, of which perhaps the best known is the decalcified bone bobbin of Mayo Robson. The operation of enteroplasty is performed for limited cicatricial stricture of the intestine. It is carried out on the same Fig. 88.—Short Cir- lines as pyloroplasty. cutting of Intestine. Enteropexy consists in fixing a portion of the intestine to the abdominal wall. It is usually performed on the pelvic colon (colopexy) in cases of chronic prolapse of the rectum. Injuries of the intestine resulting from violence applied to the anterior abdominal wall by blunt objects, most fre- quently involve the small in- testine, it may be the duo- denum where it crosses the vertebra', or the more centrally placed coils of the jejunum and ileum. The wall of the bowel maybe merely contused, or it may be ruptured. In the latter case the contents escape into the peritoneal cavity, unless the bowel happens to be empty at the moment of pIG gg.—Complete Rupture of Small injury, or the perforation is intestine with Tearing of Mesentery, closed by adhesions with tile (pr01l| pr Harvey Littlejohn’s Collection.) omentum. A contused area of bowel may undergo necrosis and subsequently separate as a slough, or it may become the seat of cicatricial contraction, causing one form of non-malignant stricture of the bowel.

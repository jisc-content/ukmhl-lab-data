THE STOMACH. 404 pylorus. The size and situation of the communication between the two compartments vary widely. The clinical features resemble on the whole those of dilatation of the stomach associated with pyloric stenosis. After the stomach has been washed out until the fluid returns clear, a sudden, unexpected gush of dirty, fermented stomach contents makes its appearance, due to reflux from the pyloric compartment of the stomach. After apparently emptying the stomach with the tube, splashing may still be elicited in the epigastric region, the pyloric segment not having been emptied. On the stomach being distended Avith air a sulcus may be recognised, separating tAvo dilated cavities. In some cases the condition simulates obstruction of the cardiac orifice. Fig. 84.—Hour-glass Contraction of the Stomach following Gastric Ulcer. The treatment is operative, and the procedure suitable to a given case can only be decided upon after the stomach has been exposed and the exact nature of the deformity discovered. When the isthmus is near the centre of the stomach, and the compartments are not much dilated, a gastroplasty carried out on the same lines as pyloroplasty may suffice. When the isthmus is near the lesser curvature, and the compartments sag downAvards so that they meet below the isthmus, gastro- anastomosis—that is, the establishment of a communication betAveen the lower part of the tAvo pouches—is indicated. The steps of the operation arc similar to those of gastro-enterostomy. If the pylorus is stenosed, gastro-enterostomy Avill be required in addition. In some cases both compartments must be united to the intestine. When the cicatrix is the seat of cancer it must be resected, and the divided ends of the stomach brought together by sutures—circular resection of the stomach.

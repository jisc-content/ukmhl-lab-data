580 THE KIDNEY AND URETER. Fig. 135.—Solitary Cyst at Upper Pole of Left Kidney, removed from a woman, ret. 29. Polycystic Kidney—Cystic Degeneration of the Kidney. —This is a comparatively rare condition, in which the kidney becomes permeated with a vast number of cysts which greatly add to the size of the organ, and which lead to the almost complete disappearance of the secreting tissue (Fig. 136). The cysts vary in size from microscopic minuteness to the dimen- sions of grapes or walnuts, and their contents are clear and straw-coloured or dark yellow, purplish or deeply blood-stained. The cysts do not communicate with the pelvis or calyces, but they often communicate with one another. Roth kidneys are commonly affected, although the disease is usually more advanced on one side. The liver, and less frequently the spleen, is also the seat of multiple cysts in a consider- able proportion of cases. As in other chronic affections of the kidney, there maybe hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart and general arterio-sclerosis. Clinical Features. — The disease may run a latent course for many years, and then cause death within a few days from suppression of urine. Not infrequently there are symptoms referable to the urinary functions— such as polyuria, slight hsematuria, thirst or dryness of the mouth—which are apt to be ascribed to the contracted form of chronic interstitial nephritis. Sometimes the chief complaint is of palpitation and breathlessness, or an enlargement in the abdomen may have attracted attention. In typical cases there is no difficulty in recognising bilateral renal tumours, with smooth hemispherical projections on the surface corresponding to the individual cysts.

Dental caries is a process of disintegration which begins on the surface of the enamel of a tooth—usually in the region of its neck—and gradually extends through the dentine till the pulp cavity is reached. It is essentially due to the decalcifying action of acid substances produced in the mouth by bacteria. The part of the tooth first affected becomes blackish or greenish, and the substance crumbles away. While the enamel is being eroded, the tooth is sensitive to. contact with hot or cold or irritating substances. When the superficial layers of the dentine are exposed, there is a dull aching pain, but this passes off as the deeper dentinal fibres and tubules are reached. When the pulp cavity is opened into, the pain returns and is more severe. Results of Dental Caries—Pulpitis.—Infection-of the exposed pulp cavity by septic organisms may set up an acute purulent pulpitis. This is associated with severe pain, which is not confined to the diseased tooth, but may spread to the adjacent teeth, and sometimes to all the branches of the fifth nerve on the corresponding side of the face. Careful search must be made for the offending tooth, lest sound teeth, to which the pain is referred, be sacrificed. Periodontitis.—The inflammatory process may spread from the tooth to the alveolo-dental periosteum, and set up a peri- odontitis. In the affected tooth there is at first a feeling of

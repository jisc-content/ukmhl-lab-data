518 THE RECTUM AND ANUS. the induration of the tissues around it. It is not always easy to pass a probe from one opening to the other on account of the irregular diverticula in the track of the channel. When the fistula follows a bilateral or “ horse-shoe ” abscess the channel may surround the rectum, and openings form on both sides— “horse-shoe fistula.” As a rule the burrow- ing is most marked towards the posterior aspect of the rectum (Fig. 118). There is always more or less pain and spasmodic contraction of the sphincters. The bowels are usually loose, and thin feces and flatus may escape linen, and causing an offensive unable to associate with others, and is Fig. 117.—Diagram of complete Fistula;. soiling the from the opening, odour. The patient is liable to become mentally depressed or even melancholic. Blind external Fistula.—About 20 per cent, of rectal fistula? belong to this variety. The fistula may result from the bursting of a perianal abscess, in which case the channel is compara- tively short and en- tirely subcutaneous, and the opening lies close to the anal margin (Fig. 119 a). In other cases it follows an ischio-rectal abscess, the sinus being deeper, and the opening farther away from the anus (Fig. 1196). After the symptoms referable to the abscess subside, the sinus discharges a small amount of thin sero-pus. The opening frequently closes up, and the discharge is retained for a day or two, but it soon bursts out again. In some cases fresh external openings form in the anal region, and in others the pus burrows into the rectum, and the fistula becomes complete. In cases of blind external fistula there is comparatively little pain on defecation, and there is no Fig. 118.—Diagram of Horse-Shoe Fistula result- ing from bilateral ischio-rectal abscess.

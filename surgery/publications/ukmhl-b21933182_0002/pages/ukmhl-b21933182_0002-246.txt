226 THE NECK. in connection with the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. Such a rib may be complete, attached at one end to the transverse process and at the other to the sternum. More frequently it is incomplete, the anterior end being free or fused with the first thoracic rib about the level of the scalene tubercle. The abnormality is seldom recognised before the age of twenty, and attention is usually first directed to it after some emaciating illness. In most cases the only inconvenience caused by the abnormal rib is a slight fulness above the clavicle. The cords of the brachial plexus are liable to be pressed upon and displaced, and the patient complains of pains down the arm and of perver- sion of sensation in the distribution of the affected nerves. In some cases atrophy of the whole limb has been observed. The subclavian artery may be lifted up and compressed, or even obliterated, by the rib. The displaced artery may be mistaken for an aneurysm. When serious pressure symptoms are present, the rib may be excised, but this operation should not be per- formed merely on account of the deformity.

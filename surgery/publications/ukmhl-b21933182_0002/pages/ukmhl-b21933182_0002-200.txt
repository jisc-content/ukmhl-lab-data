THE SALIVARY GLANDS. 180 stance forms in the intercellular spaces of the tumour, and may accumulate in sufficient quantity to give rise to cysts of various sizes. There is reason to believe that the tumours of the parotid previously described as adenoma, chondroma, angioma, myxoma, and many of the cases of sarcoma, were really mixed tumours in which one or other of these tissues predominated. The tumour develops in the substance of the parotid, and in doing so becomes encapsulated, and presses on the salivary tissue, thinning it out and causing it to undergo atrophy. In the early stages the growth can be shelled out of the gland. Clinical Features.— The mixed tumour is usually first observed be- tween the ages of twenty and thirty. It is of slow growth and painless, and forms a rounded, nodular swelling, the consistence of which varies with its structure. The skin over the swelling is normal in appearance and is not attached to the tumour (Fig. 48). Only in rare cases does paralysis re- sult from pressure on the facial nerve. Although usually be- nign, these tumours may, after lasting for years, take on malignant char- acters, growing rapidly, implicating adjacent lym- phatic glands, and showing a marked tendency to recur after removal. The treatment consists in making a free incision over the tumour and shelling it out of the gland, care being taken to avoid injuring the facial nerve or Stenson’s duct. If it is removed early and completely recurrence is rare. Sarcomata and carcinomata of the parotid are rare. They are very malignant, grow rapidly, infiltrate surrounding parts, including the skin, and infect the adjacent lymphatic glands. There is severe neuralgic pain, and paralysis from involve- ment of the facial nerve is an early symptom. Recurrence is Fig. 48.—Mixed Tumour of the Parotid of over twenty years’ duration.

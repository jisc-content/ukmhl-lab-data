The thyroid is usually more or less enlarged and pulsatile, and thrills and bruits may be heard over it on auscultation. In some cases the enlargement of the thyroid, and in others the eye symptoms, are scarcely appreciable, while the general symp- toms are well marked. The disease has been variously attributed to excessive absorp- tion of thyroid secretion, and to lesions as yet undetermined in the cervical sympathetic ganglia or in the medulla. While the affection is most common in women between the ages of twenty and forty, it is also met with in men. It is frequently hereditary, and seems to be induced in many cases by overwork, worry, or severe nervous shock. Surgical Treatment.—Excision of one lobe of the thyroid has been followed in many cases by marked alleviation of the symp- toms, and in a few by permanent cure. The operation should be performed under local anaesthesia, as the administration of a general anaesthetic is attended with great risk. Recently operations have been carried out on the cervical sympathetic cord, the three ganglia with their connecting nerve fibres being excised on both sides of the neck. As the operation is a severe one, only one side should be operated on at a time. The recorded results are so far satisfactory, but the procedure is still on its trial.

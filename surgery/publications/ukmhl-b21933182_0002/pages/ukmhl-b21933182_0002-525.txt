CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS. (After Tuttle.) 505 (Fig. 113). The two cavities are separated by a septum which varies in thickness, in some cases being so thin that the meconium causes it to bulge towards the anal canal, in others being so thick that even on bi-manual palpation no trace of the rectal tube can be detected. In a certain number of cases a pouch of peritoneum intervenes between the two cavities —an arrangement which renders it dangerous to at- tempt to establish a com- munication by means of a trocar and cannula. In these conditions, the meconium being retained, the clinical features are those of intestinal obstruction. It is seldom possible to determine by physical ex- amination the precise nature and extent of the deformity. More common than the preceding malformations are those which result from imperfect formation of the septum which divides the primitive cloaca into its genito-urinary and rectal compart- ments. The rectum may then com municate with the vagina, the bladder, or the urethra. In such cases the anal canal may be fully developed, or it also may present abnormalities. In about 50 per cent, of all cases the abnormal opening is into the vagina close to its outlet (Fig. Ill), and the condition may give rise to so little disturbance that it is for long entirely overlooked, Infant, causing death at the and only attracts attention in adult life, age of six months. Communications with the bladder and urethra are less common, and occur usually in males (Fig. 115). The opening is generally so small Fig. 115.—Congenital Com- munication between the Rec- tum fl.mt TTrpthra in n Mnlp Fig. 114.—Imperforate Anus ; the Rectum opens into the Vagina close to its outlet.

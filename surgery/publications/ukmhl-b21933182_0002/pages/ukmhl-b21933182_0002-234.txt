214 THE NECK. with the sharp spoon, cauterising or packing, are seldom successful. Abnormal appendages, composed of skin, connective tissue and yellow elastic cartilage—so-called cervical auricles—are sometimes met with in the neck. They are derived from isolated portions of a branchial arch, and are frequently found at the opening of a branchial fistula. Branchial cysts and branchial carcinoma are described with tumours of the neck. Wry-neck or Torticollis.—The term wry-neck or torticollis is applied to a condition in which the head assumes an abnormal attitude, which is usually one of combined lateral flexion and torsion. The varieties to be first described are those of muscular origin. In conditions of health the head is maintained straight and erect by the tonicity of the cervical muscles, and any want of equilib- rium between the muscles of the two sides, or be- tween different groups of muscles, results in some degree of wry-neck. Three varieties of mus- cular wry-neck are recog- nised—(1) the acute or transient form; (2) the chronic or permanent Acute or Transient wry-neck comes on suddenly, usually after the patient has been exposed to cold or damp. The sterno- mastoid, and often the trapezius, is contracted, and pulls the head to one side, twisting the face slightly towards the opposite side (Fig. 51). There is tenderness on pressing over the affected muscles, and severe pain on attempting to move the head. Usually in the course of a few days the condition passes off as suddenly as it came on. In some cases the affected muscles have been observed to undergo a certain amount of wasting after the attack. In the diagnosis of this form of wry-neck it is necessary to exclude such conditions as cellulitis, inflammation of the cervical Fig. 51.—Transient Wry-neck, which came on suddenly after sitting in a draught, and passed off completely in a few days. form ; and (3) the spasmodic form.

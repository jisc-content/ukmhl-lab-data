413 OPERATIONS ON THE INTESTINE. a continuous sero-muscular suture introduced to approximate the adjacent edges. Over this an ordinary continuous Lembert suture is made to bring together the ser- ous surfaces. Lateral implantation (Fig. 86) consists in occluding one end of the divided bosvel by a Czerny - Lembert suture, and stitching the other end to an opening made in the side of the occluded segment. Fig. 85.- -End-to-Eud Suture of Small Intestine. Fig. 86.—Lateral Implantation. Doyen’s method of occluding the bowel is simple, rapid and effi- cient. The divided end is compressed by powerful forceps (enterotribe), and in the constriction ring thus formed a silk ligature is tied. The stump beyond the ligature is trimmed with scissors and cauterised with the actual cautery, and is then invaginated into the lumen by means of a purse- string suture. Lateral anastomosis (Fig. 87) consists in occluding both ends of the divided bowel, and forming a communication by making an opening in the adjacent sides of each, and uniting these after the same method as in end-to- end suture. The term exclusion of intestine implies the formation of a lateral anastomosis be- tween adjacent loops of bowel in such a way as to prevent the passage of faeces through the intervening segment (Fig. 88). This plan of “ short- circuiting ” the bowel is adopted in certain cases of irremovable cancer and tuberculous stricture. Fig. 87.—Lateral Anastomosis.

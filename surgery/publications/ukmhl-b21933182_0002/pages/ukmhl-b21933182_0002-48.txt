28 THE CRANIUM AND ITS CONTENTS. When a wound already exists, it is enlarged as far as is necessary to secure the bleeding vessel and to remove all clots. When there is no external wound, the point at which the skull is to be opened is determined by the symptoms. If the symptoms fail to indicate which branch of the artery is torn, an opening should first be made over the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone (Fig. 2, A), and if nothing is found there, a second opening is made over the parietal bone a little above and behind the external ear. Should no blood be found outside the dura, this membrane should be incised, as there may be a clot inside it. Sometimes there is considerable difficulty in securing the Fig. 6. â€” Extra-dural Clot resulting from haemorrhage from posterior branch of left Middle Meningeal Artery. Note fissured fracture of skull and depression on surface of brain caused by clot. bleeding vessel, and the haemorrhage may assume serious propor- tions. It may be necessary to enlarge the trephine opening downwards with rongeur forceps to enable a ligature to be passed round the vessel. In some cases the artery runs in a canal in the bone, and the bleeding can only be arrested by inserting a small wooden peg into the opening, or by plugging it with antiseptic wax. It has even been found necessary to ligature the external carotid artery. Injury to the internal carotid artery within the skull may result from penetrating wounds, or may be associated with a fracture of the base. It is almost invariably fatal. In some cases a communication is established between the artery and the cavernous sinus, and an arterio-venous aneurysm is thus

450 THE INTESTINES. MESO- COLON Fig. 100.—Formation of Artificial Anus in Pelvic Colon. First stage—the l>owel is drawn out at the wound. (3) Lastly, there is the opening into the bowel made for therapeutic purposes, to which the term artificial anus may be appropriately restricted. The situation and anatomical characters of the fistula vary with its mode of origin. In the artificial anus made in the pelvic colon to relieve the symptoms in cases of cancer of the rectum, the usual arrange- ment is that of two parallel tubes of bowel opening freely on the surface, with a septum or spur between them (Figs. 100,101). The sep- tum serves to divert all the intestinal contents out at the opening. This arrangement is quite exceptional in fistuhe of other origin, but an approach to it is sometimes met with in cases of strangulated hernia, where the convexity of a loop of bowel has sloughed. In the temporary artificial anus which is made in the small intestine, and in the great maj ority of faecal fistulae, the opening in the bowel is compara- tively small, and is situated on one aspect of the tube ; hence it is that, provided there is no obstruction in the bowel beyond, only a proportion of the intestinal contents escape externally (Fig. 102). If the segment of bowel concerned is directly adherent to the parietes, it is usual for the margin of the fistulous orifice to be lined with intestinal mucous membrane, and this may protrude at the mouth of the fistula. If the opening is large enough, the bowel as a whole may prolapse as a result of any increase of the intra- Fig. 101.—Completed Artificial Aims in Pelvic Colon. The edges of the bowel after being opened have become retracted, and united with the margins of the wound in the parietes.

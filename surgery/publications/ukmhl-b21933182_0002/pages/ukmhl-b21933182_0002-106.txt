86 THE SPINE AND CORD. Even when the cord is only partially injured operative treatment is not likely to yield better results than are obtained by reduction and extension. Great care must be taken to prevent cystitis and bed-sores. Total fracture-dislocation between the atlas and axis is almost always instantaneously fatal. The odontoid process is either dislocated from under the transverse ligament or it is frac- tured. This is the lesion which occurs in j udicial hanging. Penetrating Wounds.—These result from stabs or gunshot accidents, and are practically equivalent to compound fractures of the spine, and their severity depends on the extent of the damage done to the cord, and on whether or not the wound is infected. In many cases the condition is complicated by injuries of the pleural or peritoneal cavities and their contained viscera, or by injury of the trachea, oesophagus, or large vessels and nerves of the neck. When the membranes of the cord are opened the profuse and the prolonged escape of cerebro-spinal fluid may prove a serious complication. Treatment.—The wound of the soft parts is treated on the same lines as other wounds. When the spinous processes and lamina? are driven in upon the cord they must be elevated at once by operation. In injuries involving the lumbo-sacral region it is sometimes justifiable to open the spine for the purpose of suturing divided nerve cords.

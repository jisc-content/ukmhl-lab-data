691 CANCER OF THE PENIS. the prepuce. In a few cases it has commenced in the urethra, and in others on the external skin either near the point or near the root of the penis. From the frequency with which phimosis and chronic balanitis precede the development of epithelioma of the penis these conditions would appear to be important predisposing factors. Clinical Features.—This disease is most common after the age of fifty, but has been met with in patients under thirty- five. It may begin as a wart, a fissure or excoriation, or a patch of leucoplakia. Occasionally the growth has commenced in an old cicatrix. The tumour usually assumes the form of an irregular cauli- flower-like excrescence which attains some size before ulceration occurs (Fig. 156). The base is hard, and the tumour is fixed to the glans and body of the penis. When ulceration begins the part becomes painful, the tumour bleeds readily and exudes a copious and peculiarly offen- sive discharge. The fibrous sheath of the corpus caver- nosum resists the spread of the growth for a time, but is ultimately perforated, and the tumour then infiltrates the erectile tissue in the substance of which secondary nodules may be detected. The inguinal and pelvic glands on both sides are early and widely implicated. The urethra is seldom invaded, and there is rarely any interference with micturition. In some cases a urinary fistula has developed through the prepuce. It is most important to recognise the condition in its earliest stages before glandular invasion has occurred, and at this stage it is liable to be confused with an indurated wart, or a hard chancre under cover of a tight prepuce. Treatment.—In all doubtful cases the growth should be freely removed as early as possible to prevent lymphatic invasion. The amount of the penis to be amputated depends on the stage and extent of the disease. Enlarged glands should be removed at the same time. Fig. 156.—Cancer of the Penis. (Mr. F. M. Caird’s case.)

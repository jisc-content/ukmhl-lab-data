Beyond slight staining of the linen the patient has little discomfort. Blind internal fistula is the least common form, only about 10 per cent, of all cases being of this variety. There is usually a history of an abscess having burst into the rectum, and of pus and blood having escaped from the bowel. When the abscess is of the sub- mucous variety the fistula is compara- tively short, and runs immediately under the mucous mem- brane, opening usu- ally near the anal margin (Fig. 120). When the fistula follows a pelvi-rectal abscess it is longer, more tortuous, and opens usually above the sphincters (Fig. 1206). A characteristic feature of the blind internal fistula is the way in which it repeatedly closes for a time and reopens again. There is tenesmus and pain on defecation. On digital examination the track of the fistula may be recognised as an indurated cord in the perirectal tissues, and the opening is felt as a small pit or depres- sion with thickened edges. The opening is usually single, and is most frequently situated towards the posterior part of the rectum. Tuberculous Fis tula.—A considerable number of cases of fistula-in-ano are tuberculous in character. Great difference of opinion exists as to the relative frequency of such cases, and as to the precise role played by the tubercle bacillus. Some authorities believe that the ano-rectal condition is frequently a primary manifestation of tuberculosis, while others hold that the Fig. 120.—Diagram of Blind Internal Fistulas : a following submucous abscess ; b, following pelvi rectal abscess.

TUBERCULOUS DISEASE OE THE SPINE— POTT’S DISEASE. Percival Pott, in 1779, first described a disease of the spinal column which is characterised by erosion and destruction of the bodies of the vertebrae. It is liable to produce an angular deformity of the spine, and to be associated with abscess forma- tion and with nervous symptoms referable to pressure on the cord. This disease is now known to be tuberculous. It may occur at any period of life, but in at least fifty per cent, of cases it attacks children below the age of ten. In children the spine is the most common s^eat of tuberculous disease of bone. Morbid Anatomy.—The tuberculous process may affect any portion of the spine, and as a rule is limited to one region. In some cases foci of disease occur simultaneously at several levels. The disease may begin either as an osteomyelitis of the bodies of the vertebrae, or as a periostitis affecting the anterior surface of the bones. Vertebral osteomyelitis is the form most frequently met with in children. The changes resemble those resulting from tuber- culous osteomyelitis in other spongy bones. The bodies of the affected vertebne become inflamed and softened, particularly in their anterior parts, and, as the disease progresses, caseation and

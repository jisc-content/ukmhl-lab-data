CHAPTER Y. 67 DISEASES OF THE CRANIAL BONES. Acute periostitis and osteo-myelitis—Tuberculosis—Syphilis—Tumours. Suppurative Periostitis and Osteo-myelitis.—These condi- tions are usually secondary to wounds, burns, or ulcers of the scalp, or to fractures which have become infected with pyogenic bacteria. Sometimes they follow suppuration in the middle ear and mastoid process. They are occasionally associated with acute cellulitis of the scalp. In some cases suppuration occurs on both aspects of the bone—a point of importance in treatment. The disease is usually ushered in by a rigor, which is soon followed by the other signs of suppurative inflammation—high temperature, pain and tenderness, and the formation of a fluctuat- ing swelling in relation to the bone, with oedema of the over- lying scalp. This oedema of the scalp -—usually spoken of as Pott’s puffy tumour—is of great value as indicating the extent of the disease in the bone, and of the suppuration between it and the dura. An incision gives exit to a quantity of pus, and exposes an area of bare bone. If the incision be made early, this bone may soon become covered by granulations and recover its vitality ; but if the operation be delayed, it usually undergoes necrosis. The sequestrum which forms includes, as a rule, only the outer table, but iu some cases the whole thickness of the bone undergoes necrosis. In either case the separation of the sequestrum is an exceedingly slow process, and is not accom- panied by the formation of new bone. When the whole thick- ness of the skull is lost, the deficiency of bone is usually permanent. The gap becomes filled in by a dense fibrous membrane which is adherent to the dura mater. Serious complications, in the form of septic meningitis, encephalitis, sinus thrombosis, and general pyaemia, are liable to develop at any time during the progress of the disease. Treatment.—Early, free, and if necessary, multiple incisions

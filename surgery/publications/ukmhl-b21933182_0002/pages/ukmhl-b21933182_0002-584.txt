5G4 THE KIDNEY AND URETER. become thickened and fused with the peritoneum and surround- ing tissues, and the lumen is usually dilated, although it may be narrowed or strictured. Morbid anatomy.—On section the kidney presents a number of comparatively large abscess cavities, the intervening paren- chyma being pale and tough as a result of chronic interstitial nephritis. Unless there has been antecedent hydronephrosis, the pelvis is usually small in proportion to the greatly enlarged and flask-shaped calyces which constitute the abscess cavities, and form the chief bulk of the kidney (Fig. 130). Their communications with the pel- vis and with each other are narrowed or obliterated, so that from the operator’s point of view they are to be regarded as separate cavities. The purulent contents are often mixed with crumbly masses of phosphates. The mucous membrane of the pelvis and calyces is converted into granulation tissue, and, in advanced cases, becomes the seat of ulceration which eats into the parenchyma. The renal blood-vessels are thick- ened and narrowed by end- arteritis, so that the kidney may be torn from its pedicle without more hemorrhage than can be arrested by plugging. The perinephric cellular tissue is converted into granulation and scar tissue, and is frequently the seat of scattered foci of suppuration, and sometimes a large perinephric abscess is found to communicate directly with one of the dilated calyces. The perinephric suppuration may extend into the psoas and quadratus muscles, or into the cellular planes of the abdominal wall. Clinical Features.—With the onset of the renal affection the patient’s general condition becomes worse, and to the symptoms of the antecedent condition are added pain in the kidney and abundant pus in the urine. If the outlet from the pelvis becomes Fio. 130.—Section of pyonephrosis show- ing abscess cavities. The specimen measured 18 inches in length. (Museum, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.)

The common duct is slightly larger than the cystic duct, but at its entrance into the duodenum it is so narrow that it only admits a fine probe. The mucous membrane of the gall-bladder is abundantly furnished with mucous glands. The gall- bladder forms a reservoir of bile, but this function is apparently unimportant, as the gall-bladder may be excised without detriment to health. The gall-bladder is related to the hepatic flexure of the colon, and towards its neck with the first part of the duodenum, and occasionally with the pylorus. Under normal conditions the gall- bladder and bile-ducts are readily accessible to examination and to Round Gall bladder. Under surface of liver. Duodenum (second portion). Right kidney.

Injuries.—These are not common, but may result from gun- shot or stab wounds, or from the passage of a heavy vehicle over the upper part of the abdomen. Apart from the shock, pain, and vomiting which attend all abdominal injuries, there are at first no distinctive features. There is no immediate risk to life, for, normal bile being sterile, septic peritonitis does not

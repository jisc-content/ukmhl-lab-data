Beyond an occasional shooting pain when the breast is handled or pressed upon, the patient suffers no discomfort. The soft form presents very much the same characters save that it is less firm and may attain a greater size. The cystic and 'proliferous forms usually occur in women Fig. 61.—Cystic Adenoma of Right Breast in a woman, set. 64. (Mr. Annandale’s case.) between forty and fifty years of age. They may attain con- siderable size, and give to the breast a lobulated appearance (Fig. 61) They grow more rapidly than the ordinary fibro- adenoma, and in the cystic portions of the tumour fluctuation may be recognised. The skin over the cysts may be of a bluish colour, and is usually traversed by large dilated veins. The treatment for all forms of fibro-adenoma is excision. The tumour is pinched up between the fingers and thumb, an incision radiating from the nipple is carried down to the growth, which can usually be readily shelled out of its capsule. After bleeding has been arrested the wound is completely closed.

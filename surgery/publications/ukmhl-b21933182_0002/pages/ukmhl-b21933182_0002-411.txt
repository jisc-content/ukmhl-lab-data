Lembert’s Suture.—The most generally useful suture is that suggested by Lembert in 1820 (Fig. 79). The needle is introduced about a quarter of an inch from the edge of the wound, and passed through the serous, muscular, and part of the submucous coats, and, without enter- ing the lumen of the bowel, is made to emerge close to the edge of the wound on the same side. It is next introduced to the same depth close to the edge on the opposite side, and made to emerge about a quarter of an inch farther out. When this stitch is tightened, the edges are inverted and the peritoneal surfaces are brought into close contact. These sutures may be interrupted or continuous. The Czerny-Lembert suture (Fig. 80) consists in introducing an ordinary continuous sero-muscular suture to bring the margins of the wound to- gether, and then burying this by a Lembert su ture which approximates the ser- ous surfaces. The first row may be carried through all the coats. A purse-string sut- ure (Fig. 81) is made by carrying a con- «, Suture intro- tinuous Lembert sut- ure circularly round an area of bowel, for example, that around a perforation, in such a way that when it is tightened the enclosed area is puckered in, and the serous surfaces brought into apposition. Operations on the Stomach.—The operation of gastrotomy, or opening the stomach, is most frequently performed for the removal of foreign bodies from the stomach or lower end of the Fig. 81.— Purse-String Suture- duced around perforation; b, Suture tied, ing perforation. clos-

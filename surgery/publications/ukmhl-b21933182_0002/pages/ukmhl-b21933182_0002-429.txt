DILATATION OF THE STOMACH. 409 kinked, pyloroplasty or gastro-enterostomy may be indicated. If the stomach is much dilated, its capacity may be diminished by gastroplication. Dilatation of the Stomach or Gastrectasis.â€”Dilatation of the stomach has already been referred to in connection with pyloric stenosis, due to cicatricial contraction and to cancer. It may also result from external pressure on the pylorus or duodenum, for example, by tumours of the pancreas, gall- bladder, liver or retro-peritoneal tissue. Further, the pylorus may be dragged upon and kinked by perigastric adhesions, especially those resulting from gall-stones, or by a movable right kidney. In a limited number of cases there is no dis- coverable cause for the dilatation, and the condition is then regarded as a neuroparesis. The treatment is directed towards the removal of any existing cause by surgical measures or other- wise. Failing the fulfilment of this indication, or in addition to it, it may be necessary to drain the stomach by means of a gastro-enterostomy, or the size of the organ may be reduced by gastroplication. This operation consists in making a series of horizontal folds or tucks in the anterior wall of the stomach by means of wide Lembert sutures passing from the lesser to the greater curvature. The sutures are of silk, and when tightened up they approximate the two curvatures, and so diminish the capacity of the stomach (Bircher).

TUMOURS. 69 good, but when the condition has become complicated by septic infection, and the carious process has become established over a wide area, it usually progresses in spite of treatment, and large portions of the skull may be destroyed. When the disease has erupted on the surface, local treatment is carried out on the same lines as for tuberculous disease, and it may be necessary to remove the sequestrum by operation. Tumours.—The innocent tumours met with in the bones of the skull—chondroma and osteoma—have been described with diseases of bone. Sarcoma.—All forms of sarcoma are met with in the skull. They may originate in the pericranium, in the diploe, or in the dura mater. The tumour grows chiefly towards the surface, but it also tends to involve the dura mater and to invade the cranial cavity. The tumour may thus assume the shape of a dumb-bell. Its growth is usually rapid, and the scalp is soon invaded by a diffuse soft swelling, which sometimes pulsates, and which sooner or later fungates through the skin. On account of this rapid growth the tumour is liable to be mistaken for an abscess, and if it be opened, it is found that the finger passes through a softened area in the bone. When the cranial cavity is encroached upon, signs of com- pression may ensue. After the tumour has fungated, septic complications within the skull are liable to develop. In all cases the prognosis is extremely unfavourable. If diagnosed sufficiently early, an attempt may be made to remove the tumour by means of the chisel or the Gigli saw, but very often the operation has to be abandoned. The bones of the skull may become the seat of secondary tumours, by the direct spread of cancer from the soft parts, or by metastasis of cancer or sarcoma from distant parts of the body.

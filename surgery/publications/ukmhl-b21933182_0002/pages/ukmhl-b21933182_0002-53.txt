VOL. II—3 33 CHAPTER III. INJURIES OF THE SKULL. Contusions—Fractures—Of the vault: Varieties—Of the Base : Anterior fossa—Middle fossa—Posterior fossa. The bones of the skull may be contused or fractured. These injuries are not in themselves serious : their clinical importance is derived from the involvement of the brain, by which they are liable to be complicated. Contusion of the bones of the skull may result from falls, blows, or gunshot injuries. In the vast majority of cases the damage to soft parts—scalp or brain—overshadows the osseous lesion, which of itself is comparatively unimportant. FRACTURES OF THE SKULL. While it is convenient to consider separately fractures of the vault and fractures of the base of the skull, it is to be borne in mind that it is not uncommon for a fracture to involve both the vault and the base. Fractures in either situation may be pro- duced by direct or by indirect violence, and may be simple or compound. Fractures of the Vault. Mechanism.—When the skull is fractured by direct violence, the break takes place at the seat of impact, and its extent varies with the nature of the impinging object, and the degree of violence employed. If, for example, a pointed instrument, such as a bayonet, a foil, or a spike, is forcibly driven against the skull, the weapon simply crashes through the bone, disintegrating it at the point of entrance, and cracking or splintering it for a

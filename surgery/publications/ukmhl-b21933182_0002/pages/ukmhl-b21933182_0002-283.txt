Injuries of the Chest Walt. For clinical purposes it is necessary to distinguish between those injuries of the chest which are confined to the soft tissues of the parietes, and those in which the ribs or sternum are fractured; also between those which are complicated by lesions of the internal organs and those which are not. When there is a wound of the soft parts, it is further necessary to discover whether or not it penetrates the thoracic cavity. Severe shock, which may even prove fatal, may follow a blow over the chest without there being any evidence either before or after death of a gross lesion of the bones or viscera. Simple contusion of the chest wall produced by a crush, a fall or a blow, or iu a run-over accident, is one of the most common casualties met with in hospital practice. The patient suffers from a considerable degree of shock even when the violence is comparatively slight. There is marked pallor, the pulse is weak, and the respiration short, shallow and rapid. As there is tenderness over the part struck, and a sharp, stabbing pain when the patient coughs, sneezes or takes a long breath, the condition is liable to be mistaken for a fracture of the ribs. Extensive extravasation of blood into the connective tissue planes is frequently met with, particularly in the pectoral region. Children suffer less from such injuries than adults, probably on account of the greater elasticity of the ribs and the more rounded shape of the chest, but the respiration often remains markedly accelerated (60-70), without dyspnoea or cyanosis, for several days after the injury. The treatment is directed to the relief of symptoms, and consists in combating the shock, and securing rest in bed for several days. Non-penetrating ivounds are sometimes attended with sub- cutaneous emphysema, air being sucked into the wound by the movements of the chest. In other respects they present the same characters and call for the same treatment as similar wounds elsewhere. Fracture of the Ribs.—Fracture of the ribs may be the result of direct or of indirect violence, or of muscular action. When due to a direct blow the rib gives way at the point struck, and, if the force be sufficiently severe, the fragments may be driven inwards and cause injury of the pleura, lungs, diaphragm

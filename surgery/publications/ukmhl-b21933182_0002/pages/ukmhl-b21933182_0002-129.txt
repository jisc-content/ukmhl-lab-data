SCOLIOSIS OF ADOLESCENTS. 109 the left side is much more marked than on the right. The left hip is usually projected upwards and backwards. As seen from the front the right side of the chest is flattened, while the left side is abnormally prominent. The right nipple is on a higher level than the left. In aggravated cases the patient may suffer from shortness of breath on exertion, and the respiratory difficulty may react on the heart, causing dilatation of the right side, palpitation, and precordial pain. The next most common form is a 'primary lumbar curvature with its convexity to the left (Fig. 27). It is usually met with in males. The deviation of the lumbar verte- brae produces a prominence in the left flank which masks the outline of the hip on that side, while the right flank shows a deep furrow and the hip is unduly prominent. There is a slight compensatory curve to the right in the dorsal region, and the right side of the chest projects backwards. The brachio-thoracic triangle is much more marked on the right than on the left side. Fig. 27.—Scoliosis in which the primary curvature involves the lumbar region and the convexity is to the left. There is marked rotation of the bodies of the vertebrae. (Museum of Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh.) Diagnosis.—In many cases the patient is brought to the surgeon on account of pain and weakness in the back before any distinct deviation has developed, and, unless a care- ful examination is made, the real cause of the symptoms is liable to be overlooked. The patient should be stripped as far as the buttocks and examined in various attitudes; for example, standing in an easy position, standing as straight as she can, and sitting on a flat stool. In early cases, an inequality in the level of the angles of the scapula; is often the only physical sign to be detected. It should also be observed whether the line of the spines is altered when the patient hangs from a horizontal bar or trapeze.

125 THE ORBIT. to erysipelas of the face, or to inflammatory conditions in the nasal fossae or their accessory air sinuses. Clinical Features.—The disease is ushered in by general malaise, rigors, high temperature, and severe pain which radiates all over the affected side of the head. There is marked ex- ophthalmos and fixation of the globe, with redness, swelling, and tenderness of the eyelids, and congestion and ecchymosis of the conjunctiva. The pupil is usually dilated, and the cornea becomes opaque and may ulcerate. There is photophobia and sometimes diplopia. Resolution is rare. The pus which forms burrows in every direction, and may ultimately point through the eyelids or conjunctiva. Sometimes the inflammation spreads to the meninges of the brain, or it may set up a thrombo-phlebitis of the oph- thalmic vein which spreads to the cavernous sinus. The eye- ball may be infected and de- structive panophthalmitis result. The prognosis is therefore always grave. The treatment consists making one or more in- cisions into the cellular tissue for the purpose of evacuating the pus and establishing drain- age. A narrow bis- toury is passed in parallel to the wall of the orbit, care being taken to avoid injuring the globe. When possible, the incision should be made through the conjunctiva, but in some cases efficient drainage can only be established by incising through the lid. When the eye is destroyed by panophthalmitis, the propriety of eviscerating or enucleating it will have to be considered. Tumours of the Orbit.—Tumours may originate in the orbit or may invade it by spreading from adjacent cavities. Those which originate in the orbit may be solid or cystic. Of the solid tumours the round or spindle-celled sarcoma is the most common. Melanotic tumours also occur, and they probably Fig. 34.—Sarcoma of Orbit, causing exophthalmos downward displacement of the eye, and pro- jecting in temporal region. always in the pigmented structures of the globe.

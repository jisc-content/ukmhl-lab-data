WANDERING SPLEEN. 487 which resemble those of a twisted ovarian cyst. The clinical features tend to merge into those of peritonitis, with or without the symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Partial torsion results in engorgement; complete torsion may terminate fatally, or, if the patient survive, the organ may undergo atrophy. In diagnosis attention should be directed to the absence of the normal splenic dulness, and to the shape of the prolapsed organ, which is usually freely movable and appears to float on the intestines. Treatment.â€”The condition may be palliated by rest in bed, and by the use of a belt when the patient is going about. If the organ is healthy and capable of being replaced in its normal position, it may be fixed there by the operation of splenopexy. The method of Rydygier consists in making a new pocket for the organ by incising the parietal peritoneum in the line of the tenth rib, separating the peritoneum from the parietes, and implanting the spleen in the bed thus made for it. If the organ be diseased it is better to remove it. In the majority of the cases in which the pedicle undergoes torsion, the organ should be removed, as this is easier of execution and secures a more rapid recovery than splenopexy.

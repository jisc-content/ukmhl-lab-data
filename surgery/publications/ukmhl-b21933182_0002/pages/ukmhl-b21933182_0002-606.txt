586 THE URINARY BLADDER, vesicse.—This is a rare malformation, in which there is an arrest of development of the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall, symphysis pubis, bladder, urethra, and external genitals. The term extroversion is applied to it because the posterior wall of the bladder, being unsupported in front, is pushed forwards like a hernia, and projects in the middle line below the navel (Fig. 138). In the infant, it presents as a rounded tumour about the size of a walnut, showing respiratory movements, and being partly reducible on pressure. The surface is covered with mucous membrane, which is sensitive, and may show the effects of surface irritation, and the skin around the projection often presents Fig. 138.—Extroversion of the Bladder in a Female Child. irregular cicatrices. At the lower part of the tumour are the ureteral openings, from which the urine escapes in jets from time to time. In the male the tumour is continuous below with a rudimentary penis, the urethra being represented by an open gutter on the dorsum—epispadias. The malformation entails considerable suffering, the urine dribbles away, so that the clothing is constantly wet, and the skin becomes red and excoriated. Decomposition of the urine and inflammation of the exposed mucous surface of the bladder are liable to occur, and the infection may ascend to the kidneys and prove dangerous to life. Various plastic operations have been performed with the object of forming a new anterior wall to the bladder, but because

601 STONE IN THE BLADDER of tlie renal pelvis and calyces, vesical stones are usually rounded, ovoid, or discoid (Fig. 142), and when there are several they tend to acquire a faceted surface as a result of mutual contact (Fig. 144). The stone may form a cast of the portion of the bladder with which it lies in contact. Many stones, for example, present a groove on the lower aspect due to the inter-ureteral bar. When a stone lies partly in the bladder and partly in the prostatic urethra, it may present a characteristic hour-glass con- striction corresponding to the junction of the two cavities F 143.-Oxalate of Lime or Mulberry (Fig. 145). Calculus. Sources of Origin.— The ... .. . . J y (Irom Professor AnnaEJlale s Collection.) great majority of vesical calculi have descended from the kidney, and after entering the bladder have increased in size. The minority take origin in the bladder, most commonly by the precipitation of phos- phates as a result of alkaline decomposition of the urine. The formation of stones around foreign bodies affords the most striking example of the latter method of origin (Fig. 139).

Relations to the Bladder.—A stone usually lies free in the cavity of the bladder and alters its position with the attitude of

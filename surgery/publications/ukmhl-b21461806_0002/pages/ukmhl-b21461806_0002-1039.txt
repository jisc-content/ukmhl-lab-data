The mode of bleeding most frequently practised is that of opening a vein ; and it may be done in the arm, ankle, jugular vein, frontal vein, veins under the tongue, on the back of the hand, &c. In vvliatever part, however, venesection is performed, it is al- ways necessary to compress the vein, between the place where the puncture is made and the heart. Thus the return of blood through the vein is stop- pe.l, the vessel swells, becomes conspicuous, and, when opened, bleeds much more freely than would otherwise happen. Hence, according to the situa- tion of the part of the body where the vein is to be opened, with regard to the heart, the bandage, or other means for making the necessary pressure, must be applied either above or below the puncture. All the apparatus essential for blood-letting is a bandage or fillet, two or mure small pieces of folded linen for compresses, a basin to receive the blood, and a little clean water and a towel. The bandage ought to be about a yard in length and about an inch broad, a common riband or garter being frequently employed. The com- presses are made by doubling a bit of linen rag from one to two inches square. On the part of the surgeon, it is necessary to have a good lancet, of proper shape. He should never bleed with lancets with which he has been in the habit of opening any kind of abscesses, as very trouble- some complaints have been the consequence of doing 80. The shape of the instrument is also a matter of some importance. If its shoulders are too broad, it will not readily enter the vein, and when it dues enter, it invariably makes a large opening, which is not always desirable. If the lancet be too spear-pointed, an incautious operator would often run the risk of transfixing the vein, and wounding the artery beneath it. More, how- ever, certainly depends on the mode of introducing the lancet than on its shape. Ill blood-letting, the patient may lie down, sit down, or stand up, each of which positions may be chosen according to ciicuiiistances. If the patient be likely to fiiiiit from the loss of a small quantity iif blood, and such fainting can answer no surgical purpose, it is best to bleed him in the recumbent posture. But when the person is strong and vi- gnrou.s, there is little occasion for this precaution, and a sitiing posture is to be preferred, as tlio most convenient both for tlie surgeon and patient.

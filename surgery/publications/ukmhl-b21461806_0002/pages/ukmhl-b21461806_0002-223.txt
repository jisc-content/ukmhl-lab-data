I and grooved to within a line of the extienuty, which is of the size of No. 1 probe. It is used in the way described above. I may take this opportunity of saying once again, how cautious it is nccessar}'- to be in the manipulations upon the canaliciili, particularly when they are the seat of stricture, and how desi- rable to proceed gradually from one step to another, not neglecting subsidiary points of treatment. I may also state that when one canaliculus is stric- tured and the other open, I prefer to proceed with the treatment of the sac and nasal duct through the open canaliculus, leaving the other alone; for°a stricture of one canaliculus is often for itself insuf- ficient to cause any epiphora, and if the sac inflam- mation and the stricture of the nasal duct can be cured by probes conveyed through the open canali- culus, the patient is relieved effectually, even should the other remain strictured, which"it often does not. In such instances, however, I always slit up both puncta." _ Mr. Bowman's treatment of lachrymal obstruc- tions is the one generally employed. Cauterization of the lachrymal sac with the actual cautery (/)/ Desmarres' method, pp. 393-414, vol. i. ed. 2) has been tried in some forty cases, none of which were satisfactorily cured.] C. Bader.

LAGOPHTHALMIA (from \dyos, a hare • and ofdaK/xhs, an eye). flare's Eijc, Oculus Leportmis.~K disease in which the eye cannot be completely shut. The following complaints may arise from it—a constant weeping of the organ in consequence of the interruption of the alternate' closure and opening of the eyelids, which motions so materially contribute to the propulsion of the tears into the nose ; blindness in a strong light in consequence of the inability to moderate the rays \yhich fall on the eye; on the same account the sight becomes gradually weakened ; there is inca- pacity to sleep where there is any light ; and irri- tation, pain, and redness of the eye, from its being exposed to extraneous substances in the atmosphere. An enlargement or protrusion of the whole eye, or a staphyloma, may obviously produce lagophthalmia. But affections of the upper eyelid are the common causes. Now and then lagoph- tlialmia depends on paralysis of the orbicularis muscle. A cicatrix is the most frequent cause. When lagophthalmia arises from a paralytic affection of the orbicularis palpebrarum, the eyelids may be rubbed with a liniment containing the tmctura lyttas, or the linimentura camphorae. Elec- tricity or galvanism may be tried, together with bark, the shower bath, &c. When the affection arises from spasm of the levator palpebrre superioris, the surgeon may try a bhster on the temple, rub the eyebrow or eyelid with the tmctura opii, or a solution of belladonna or atropine, and prescribe antispasmodic remedies When lagophthalmia arises from the contraction 0. a cicatrix Us relief is to be attempted on the same principles as in ectropion, [LARYNGOSCOPE. The discovery of the laryngoscope was announced before the Hunterian Society by Dr. Benjamin Babington, in March 182!), when he exhibited his instrument, which consisted of an oblong piece of looking glass set in silver wire, with a long shank. Previous to this the idea of illuminating the cavities of the body was conceived by Bozzini, of Frankfort, in 1007 who descrilied a reflector for examining the pos' teriornnres. About ]!i33, Sclligue, an ingenious mechanic, contrived a mirror for seeing the larynx and in ]()3f!, Beaumes of Lyons another for seeing the larynx and back of the nostrils. Listen was in the habit of using a speculum to look at an ulcerated glottis, wliich ho made known in 1840 {Practical Surpc.ry, p. 417). In 1844, Warden invented a prismatic speculum for the glottis and in 1846, Mr. Avery had possessed instruments

BIOGRAPHY OF SAMUEL COOPER, F.R.S. The need of a biographical memoir of Samuel Cooper, the author of the Surgical Dictionary," has long been felt by the readers of that great work But m drawing up the short sketch of his life which I now present to their notice, I am fully aware of the difficulties of the task which, prompted by a feeling of gratitude _ to my distinguished kinsman, and by the solicitations of many professional friends, I have undertaken. It is impossible in the compass of a few pages to pamt in sufficiently brilliant coloui-s the career of one whose name is almost hallowed in the science of surgery; who, by his constant energy and unwearied zeal, circulated throughout the world the fruit of his ereat labours and condensed for us into one library the writings of so many illustrious men, hitherto diiFused and scattered over a vast surface. The achievement of his great work the " Surgical Dictionary" raised him to the highest pinnacle of professional fame, and as during his life he ever laboured in the cause of science so he has left behind him, in the fruit of his industry and talent an imperishable monument to his memory.

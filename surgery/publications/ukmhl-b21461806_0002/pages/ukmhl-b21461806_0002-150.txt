IRIS, INFLAMMATION 01 102 avoided. Stronger motives than those already urged must be assigned before the surgeon adopt an operation wliich a wholesome prejudice at least deems to be fraught with great danger, in prefer- ence to one (the lumbar) comparatively harmless. Notwithstanding Mr. Luke's preference for Littre's operation, he records a case in which he failed to find the seat of obstruction by this proceeding, although he anticipated its presence either in tlie top of the rectum or in the sigmoid flexure. The autopsy disclosed a strangulation of the ileum by a band. The wound in the loin is deemed to be more disposed to close than that made in the groin, and the comfort to the patient is greater, and its management more easy, when seated in the groin than in the loin. In reply, I quote the case oi Mr. Hawkins {Med. Chir. Trans, vol. xxxv. p. 89): "The artificial anus has shown the usual tendency to contraction, to obviate which I have had an ivory plug made of the requisite length and size The plug is attached to a small brass plate, which is inclosed in a larger one of India-rubber, which covers the adjacent parts, and is retained in its place by an elastic bandage or by plaster. This plug is generally withdrawn for an hour or an hour and a half in the morning for the escape of the contents of the bowel, after which it is again introduced for the rest of the day, and with it the lady ia able to ride and walk out, and enter into society without inconvenience." Also, supposing the bowel lying between the arti- ficial opening and the anus to become competent to the performance of its functions at any future time, the permanent existence of the artificial opening may be deemed unnecessary, and in the loin no difficulty will be experienced in closing it; but in the groin the probable presence of a spur-like process projecting into the intestinal tube from the mesenteric margin of the bowel opposite to the fistu- lous opening, cannot but be an obstacle to the ready transit of the intestinal contents beyond the fistula towards the anus. This spur is due to the altered and fixed position of the free margin of the bowel to the anterior abdominal wall, and to the angle necessarily formed at this point. This complica- tion, while it will probably attend Littre's, will not be found associated with the lumbar operation. (See Art. Artificial Anus.) After-traatinent—T\\\i consists in cleanliness; m protecting tiie integument around the aperture irom the irritating discharge by the application of some oleaginous substance, or of collodion; avoiding any tendency to diarrhoea by a-simple and wholesome diet; in aiding the removal of hardened fc-eces by warm-water injections; in preventing a tendency to contraction of the aperture by the use of a suit- able plug; in favouring periodical evacuations by the employment of an appropriate plug or truss, and in inducing the patient to acquire the habit ol empty- ing the bowel at stated times. Should prolapsus ot the bowel occur, it must be reduced by taxis, and be retained in position by a plug. , . Artificial anus in Although in the adult, in whom the ascending and descending colon is fixed to the loin, and usually uncovered by pen- toneum to the extent of at least one-third of its circumference, corresponding to the interval be- tween the lateral longitudinal muscular bands, no great difficulty in reaching tlie bowel is experi- enced; still, Mr. Curling {Med. Chir. Trans, vol. xliii. p. 311) has shown that such facility does not always attend the operation in infants, either from the occasional existence of a loose mesocolon, or from the presence of the kidney, which, being large at this period of life, may overlie the bowel; while the depth at which the bowel lies from the surface renders a larger incision necessarj'. Un- less the sigmoid flexure be abnormally placed, Littre's operation should therefore have the pre- ference with infants.] C. F. Maunder. [Case of Bird & Hilton, Med. Chir. Truns. vol. xxx. p. 51.

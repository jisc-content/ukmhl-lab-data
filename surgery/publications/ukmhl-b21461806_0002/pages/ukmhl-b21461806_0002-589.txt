537 RECTUM, DISEASES OF such cases, and the success attending it has been considerable. Mr. Curling mentions six cases operated on at the London Hospital, four by him- self, one by Mr. Adams, and one by Mr. Critchctt, with three recoveries and three deaths ; but a better avL-iage than this may be hoped for, as the propriety of the operation becomes more generally rec guis'ed, and it is undertaken at an earlier penod.J before the powers of the patient have become exhausted. But in other cases, where the obstruction is not complete, the pain produced by the passage of the faces over the ulcerated surface is sometimes so acute, that the patient is glad to purchase relief at anv cost, and will readily assent to a proposal to divert the contents of the bowels from their natural course. Mr. Nathaniel Ward performed lumbar colotomy in a case of this kind in the London Hospital. The patient recovered, and lived for eight months. His severe symptoms were greatly relieved by the diversion of the ffecal matter through the artificial anus. A similar case, in which the patient's sufferings were ex- treme, was operated on in St. Mary's Hospital, by the writer, but the patient, an elderly female, whose powers were much exhausted, unfortunately died four days afterwards from peritonitis. The pain, however, produced by the cancerous disease, almost entirely ceased from the time of the opera- tion. Several cases of the kind have been operated on in St. Mark's Hospital by Messrs. Gowlland and AUingham, with satisfactory results. Farther observations on this subject, and a de- scription of the operation, will be found in the article on Intestinal Obstructions.] Foreign Bodies in the Rectum. Foreign bodies introduced into the rectum by accident or design occasionally require to be ex- tracted, as clyster pipes, bougies, portions of fish bone, or of the bones of chickens, rabbits, &c. This may generally be accomplished with forceps, or the lithotomy scoop guided on the finger. In the third volume of the Mtm. de I'Acad, de Chir. M. Morand has given the particulars of many cases of this kind. In a case for which M. Mar&hal was consulted, a pig's tail had been introduced with the thick end uppermost, into the rectum of a woman of the town by a medical stu- dent, whom she had offended. The tail had been prepared for the purpose, the bristles being cut short; the consequence was that any attempt to remove it gave rise to most excruciating pain; the rectum became inflamed ; and the bowels obstructed. Death must have been the result, had not the surgeon succeeded, by a clever yet simple plan, in extracting the foreign body. Having tied a piece of strong cord to the lower end of it, he introduced a tube over it, and without pain or difficulty removed both together. An anonymous writer extracted from a boy's rectum a wooden dragoon with his horse; a toy which his play- fellows had great trouble to introduce; and he had to dismount the dragoon before extraction; that is, he broke it with a strong bent forceps for extracting polypi. The same author consider.v the introduction of the finger into the vagina of great use as a means of promoting the removal ol some foreign bodies from the rectums of prostitutes, who are sometimes the victims of drunken brutal- ity. {Bee Edinb. Med. and S'urj. Joui n. No. 134, p. 279.) Mr. Listen once' extracted from' the rectum half the jaw of a rabbit which had been swallowed. Fish bones, or small spicula of large ones, are apt to penetrate and pass into the cel- lular tissue in the vicinity of the bowel, where they ma}' produce abscess and a fistula in ano. (See Liston on Practical Surgery, p. 356.) Of such occurrences. Sir Benjamin Brodie has met with instances. An instance is mentioned by Mr. Mayo, in which the rectum was torn by an injection pipe, and death occasioned by the passage of a pint of water-gruel through the laceration into the ab- dominal cavity.

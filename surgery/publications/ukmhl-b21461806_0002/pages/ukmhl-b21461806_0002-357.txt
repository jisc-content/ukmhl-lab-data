MORTIFICATION Mofltficallon/rom delility, loss of Mood, Sec—A generally ill-nourished state of body, whether from privation, exposure, or disease, is a most efficient predisposing cause of mortification, especially if. with deficient and unhealthy blood, there be super- added some injury of enfeebled parts. Sometimes some circumstance causing great general debility at once induces mortification of the extremities, ihus Sir B. Brodie narrates how a drunken man got a chemist more drunk than himself to bleed iiim to three pints; next day both feet were found mortified as high as the instep. The patient re- covered^ with the help of wine and nourishment. {Urodie s Lectures on Mortification ib ) fJV}^ "i'^i"'" ^^°SPiTAL Gangrene will be ound the differences between that affection and true mortification-.

But, besides the diffuse form ot gangrene and sphacelus of the subcutaneous tissue, there is a circumscribed form, which is observed in furunculus and carbuncle. "The great accumulation of blood, and the still greater and rapid effusion of serosity, which takes place n these circumscribed acute inflammatory affec- lons, produce a state of extreme induration ot the cellular tissue, a greater or lesser portion 0. which being thus, as it were, strangulated, dies from want of nutrition, becmnes separated trom the living parts, and is expelled in the form of a grey or straw-coloured spongy or pulpy mass, through an opening made in the skin by a similar process, or a surgical operation." (See Carswell s Illustrations of the Elem. Forms of Disease Fasc. 7.) In erysipelas phlegmonoides, the cellular tissue connecting the muscles, tendons nerves, blood-vessels, &c. often perishes to a great extent. Here large portions of skin are frequently destroyed by sloughing or ulceration, so that muscle, blood-vessel, tendon, nerve, &c. are ex- posed to view, quite denuded of their proper cover- ings, and in different states of disease. In truth, he cellular tissue ,s not only more frequently the seat of mortification but it is also more extensively '^"'"•"y*^ by it, than any other issue of the body. This fact is important to be " ca leTt'l? 'he operation of amputation, when called for by mortification, because it dictates the prudence of beginning the incidon higher up than the mere appearance of the skin would indicate The cellular tissue may slough from idionathic disease, as carbuncle and erysipelas-from di tension, as by cedema: from injection of in-itant fluids, as urinary and faecal abscess. Artery is the texture endowed with the great- est power of resisting its o.vn destruction by mor- tification. " I have (says Dr. Thomson) in va- rious instances of erysipelas phlegmonoides, seen several inches of the femoral artery laid com" p etely bare by the gangrene, ulce'ratioVand sphacelus of the parts covering it, without its giving way before death.

(P. 523.) I have often seen tlm trutliot the foregoing statement plainly illustrated in cases of sloughing buboes, by which several mches of the femoral artery were exposed. I have seen the throbbing brachial artery denuded for more than a month, nearly its whole extent along tlie inside of the arm, by the ravages of malig. naiit and phagedenic ulceialion, attended with repeated sloughing ; and yet haemorrhage had no shm'c in carrying oil" the uiifortuiinto pationt Ihe blood coagulates in the large arteries 'wl,ich X 2

66 and of its sulisequent transformations, and so it is maintained in ' anormal' nutrition; tlie exudation and subsequent clianges are one process also. " Not only do " cells" possess power of develop- ment, but, as was shown by the Brothers Goods.r in 1842 (Anatomical and Pathological Observa- <.-o«., Edinburgh, 1845), they have powers of de- struction of neighbouring tissues, and are agents "! the work of absorption. As they grow m the in- terstices of an inflamed tissue or on an ulceiating surface " the subjacent tissues also disappear, either by previous solution and subsequent absorp- tion by the properties and powers o thelormer,or under\he peculiar circumstances of inflammamT action, by the more vigorous growth of the foin e monopolising the resources of the part, the latter dissolving and disappearing by the usual channels of the returning circulation more rapidly, but ac- cording to ordinary laws." The view here given of the" destructive power of an actively growing cell-structure, on a part in contact whose vita ity s imm red was well shadowed forth by that able Tgeon ABton Key in WiZ iOn Vtceraf... of Joints, Med.Chir.

(Life of Jirodie, by C. Hawkins, 18Go, vol. ii. p. 218.) . . Pursuing our sketch, we must next notice the remarkable researches of W. Addison, of Malvern who (Lond. Med. Gaz., Dec. 18, 1840, p. 44/) demonstrated white corpuscles, known to Hewson and Senac {leucocytes or sarcopTiytes) in the buffy coat, and soon afterwards {ibid Jan., 1841 p. 689) their presence in the capillaries; their' accumulation in the inflamed capillaries of the frog's foot; their sluggish adherence to the sides of the vessel, whilst the red globules move on in a rapid stream in the centre. In the same year {Med. Gaz., July 23), and more fully in his Principles of Medicine Voio. Dr C J B Williams announced the lull sig- nificance of that behaviour of the white corpuscles which is only just beginning to be understood after thirty years of neglect. The microscopical research which led to this discovery, which the time was not ripe to receive, was unusually caretu ; but Dr Williams was not freed from by the pathology of Boerhaave and Himter, and believed that the chief phenomena of inflammation were referable to obstruction of debilitated capillaries by blood rendered viscid by unusual abundance of white corpuscles, together with increased action of the Mr. Gulliver (Lectures, Med. Times and Gaz., 1862, vol. ii.), justly adverts to the embryonic character of the white corpuscles, and their import- ance in the work of development. _ Just so, the eminent pathologist H. Lebert, in his Physiologie palliologique (Pans, 184o), de- scribes all that Dr. Williams saw, but afhrma that there is no escape of globules in the exudation of inflamed capillaries without rupture; that tlie cell elements found in inflamed tissues are formed in them, out of the exuded liquid which serves as blastema, and do not pre-exist as such in he vessels. Lebert, in speaking of the pathology of leTs, describes their formation from, the aggrega- ti n of granules, and gives descriptions of the whUe blood corpuscles, of pyoid granular globu es een active in the vessels of an inflamed part and of pus corpuscles, as so many entirely distinct Sties althou'gh the difl:erence between thein in his drawings is almost imperceptible. In Ins ^Lt AnLnie pathologique (Pitns, 8o/) he s ill denies the influence of the white globules iix Sammation, describes the formation of globules I as free cells outside' the vessels, and attributes e..- ' udatioii to increased pressure in the caFiHaru-s, combined with increased attraction hetwee the blood, the capillaries, and the cxtravasculai tissue, for which last item Virchow is quoted. _ But to return.

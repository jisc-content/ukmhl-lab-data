116 JOINTS, DISEASES OF. common both in cases of foreign bodies in the joints and other diseases of these parts, are soon added other particuUir signs, by which the nature of the case is evinced. . [" All these loose or pedunculated bodies, Mr. Bryant observes, " give rise to similar symptoms. They are sometimes traced to a previous attack ol inflammation of a joint; in other instances they show themselves after a strain. In many cases however, no cause can be assigned, audit is more than probable that they are new developments which follow their own laws, and do not depend npon any of these usually fj^^^ <^^^f'- ^^'^ may certainly be discovered after one of them but it appears more probable that the sprain or inflam- mation of the joint is the result of the presence of the cartilage and its malposition, the cartilage during walking or some movement of the joint becoming fixed and pinched between the articular surfaces of the bones." (See Thomas B.yani on the Diseases and Injuries of the Joints,^. U^i) These bodies are mostly discovered accidentalfy by the patient, who, in walking or moving the joint suddenly experiences a severe pain, and is unable o move the articulation; the joint cannot be flexed orstraightened completely. The severe pain is often so intense as to cause faintness or sickness, which however, quickly disappears ^vhen the loose bod^ slips from between the bones, which is xnd.cated hv a snap.

It s tf be observed! however, that there are some instances in which no P^'" «^P"'^7J;,5ht patient under these circumstances. Mr. Enchse savs it is difficult to explain the cause of this evere pain. Richet thinks it may be owing to he s .novial membrane being pinched between the foreign body and one of the articular surface .

Iron, an ' " ' . inconvenience for several months, ^^he ' ^5 ""P toms indicating their presence I'^^^'^^f^Pf^^'f In the diagnosis of Uiis affection the loose bodit can generuilv be made out and felt by the surgeon at the surface of the joint. Some stiffness and slight inflammation may follow the first occurrence of the injury to the loose body, and these subside in a few days by rest and other treatment, again only to be renewed upon a recurrence «f the accident.] In handling the knee, the sufferer feels a hard pro- minent substance, which slips aboutunder his fingers, and glides under the patella or the ligament of this bone, and sometimes under the tendon of the exten- sor muscles of the leg, from one side of the joint to the other. The extraneous body may make its ap- pearance either at the inside or the outside of the articulation; but it most frequently presents itself at the former part, which is the broadest and most sloping, while the capsular ligament there is loosest. Desault met with one instance, in which the cap- sular ligament and soft parts were so loose that the patient could turn the extraneous substance round and round. [Although we have no statistics to illustrate the frequency of cases of loose bodies in joints, they may be considered not very rare. On this point Mr. Bryant observes that the disease is by no means an uncommon one, for about thirteen cases have taken place in Guy's Hospital within the last five years: twelve of these were in the knee, and one in the elbow-joint. In two of these the cartilaTes were removed without a bad symptom ; in a third an attempt was made, but the cartilage slipped away; in the remaining ten palliative treat- ment was alone employed. (See Bryant s work already qicoled.)] . . ■ ^ • • » If we except making an incision into the joint for the purpose of extracting these cartilaginous formations [or of causing their adhesion at tlie side of the joint at the seat of puncture], we are not acquainted with any certain means of freeing a patient from the inconvenience of the complaint. To this plan the danger attendant on all wounds ot so large an articulation as the knee is a very serious objection. Middleton and Gooch endeavoured to conduct the extraneous body into a situation where it produced no pain, and to retain it in that posi- tion a long time bv bandages, under the idea that the cartilaginous substance would adhere to the contiguous parts and occasion no future troub e. FThis, in fact, is the palliative treatment of the present day, and is adopted by some surgeons in preference to the radical or operative treatment bj means of which the loose body is removrd alto- gether from the joint, or is fixed in an unoffending position. As a rule, Mr. Bryant thinks the pal- liative treatment is the correct one to be enforced ; for he observes, " knowing how destructive in- flammation of a joint following a wound too often becomes, few surgeons would venture upon an operation without an absolute necessity, and such seldom exists. If tiie movements of the joints are restrained by means of strapping or an elastic bandage, or if the loose body can in any way be hxed by the same means, any injurious effects will seldom be experienced. If the cartilage shot.ld be occasionally pinched between the ^t'^"]' f J '^j Lones, and, as a consequence, some sbg 't syi oml inflammation should take place, rest, and »P1 " cation of cold lotions or blisters, -.th. a mild pi.- native, are generally sufficient to allay .t It tUtse i measures ari enough, any of-at,ve inu^- ference is certainly not required, as «3" fi ible for any surgeon to submit his patient to the ri k 0 an acute inflammation of a joint by making a wound, whether subcutaneous or otherwise, into

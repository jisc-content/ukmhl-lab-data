130 JOINTS, DISEASES OF. such as the articulations of the vertehra;. When the articular ends of the long bones arc affected, and cades and necrosis are complicating and keep- in" up the disease, it is seldom that the joint can recover itself. When the articulation is very si- nuous, as in the carpus, or ^vhen a number of small ■loints communicate with one another, if not duec y by synovial membrane, at all events indirectly throiK'h the medium of ligament and fibrous tissue, as in the tarsus, a cure can scarcely be anticipated In all these cases, hectic and great constitutional irritation usually come on; or, the joint becommg useless or cumbersome, its removal must be prac- tised either bv excision or amputation, i he result will at last, in a great measure, depend upon the state-of the bones that enter into the conformation of the joint. If these be sound, or not primarily affected, and the patient's constitution have got over the effect of suppuration in the joint, ankylosis more or less complete may be confidently looked for But if the articular ends of the bones be primarily or deeply implicated, then excision or amputation will be the only alleviation. When an inflamed joint appears to be disposed to undergo a cure, its repair by ankylosis must be facilitated by keeping it in a proper posi ion such as will be most useful to the patient in after-life, the straight one for the knee and hip, and the • semi-flexed for the elbow. Should it have assumed a faulty position in consequence of the surgeon neglecting to support it properly m splints in the early acute stage, the patient may be anasthet.sed, and the limb slowly and gently placed m such a position as will be most conducive to the patient s after-comfort. At the same time it may be useful to strap the joint firmly in the proper position m the way recommended by Mr. Scott when it is the knee that is affected, or when the hip or elbow are implicated, fixing it well by means of starched bandages. Scott's plan of treatment consists m spreading on pieces of lint the strong mercuri..l ointment, to every ounce of which a drachm of cam- phor has been added ; strips of soap-plaster spread upon leather are then cut of a proper length and breadth, and the joint is firmly and accurately strapped up, the limb having previously been band- aged as high as the joint that is strapped. This dressing may be left on for a week or two Sntil Unloosens or gives rise to irritation; over the whole a starched bandage may be applied. In many cases Mr. Erichsen has found it advantageous to strap up the joint with a plaster composed of eainl Lts of emp. ammon. cum hydrarg., and the eZ sap ni° o-: belladonnce. These applications ^ronl/fix the joint and promote the absorption of the plastic matter that is deposited around it, but, bv ac ing as gentle counter-irritants, remove the Smains of the inflammation that may be going on within it.] bein alluded to 1^^ -'^ -^rfa^TLotS >iv mr Tlpniamin Brodie, iVir.

From it we ^-^'^, ^^^^^^^^ garth, of Bath described one of '.^s appearance as " Nodosit; of the Joints," deriving his ideas from the hard swellings which he observed around several of the smaller joints. Cruveilhict was the next writer who specially called attention to it, and pointed out the propriety of studying, with refer- ence to each other, its symptoms in the living sub- ject, and its anatomical characters in the dead. 1 he difficulty of adapting some special name was felt by Dr. Adams, equally with Haygarth and Cru- veilhier. " Its symptoms," Dr. Adams observes, "like those of chronic rheumatism, are slow in their progress, and of a sub-inflammatory nature, and the joints, large and small, are the principal seats of it; it is therefore a ' Chronic Arthritis,' or ' Chronic inflammation of the joints,' partaking more of the rheumatic character than of any other with which I am acquainted. With such ideas I have long since ventured to name the disease ' aro7iic Rlieumatic Arthritis; and under this head have communicated to the Pathological Society (ot Dublin) many facts and observations on the malady; and indeed, in this city at least, I may say that the term is now current with the profession. {Up. oil p 4.) This disease has been carefully de- scribed as occurring in the hip by Dr. R. W. Smith of Dublin, and some valuable Notes on the Morbid Anatomy of the same disease in the shoul- der and other joints have been published by Mr. Edwin Canton. {Path, and Surg. Obs. pp. 1 to 33.) We would here also refer to the minute examina- tion of the articular extremities in this disease made by Mr. Wm. Adams, published in the drd _ volume of the Transactions of the Pathological So- ciety of London. _ The disease in the majority of cases has been preceded by an attack of rheumatic fever, from the lingering remains of which the chronic rheumatic arthritis has evidently sprung. Exposure to cold andhumidity, or to night air; gouty diathesis; uterine disorder; are causes of it. Sir B. Brodie observed it among the upper servants, hall-porters, and tall footmen of large London houses; and Dr. Adams among the damply-lodged and potato-fed peasants of Ireland. It is asserted by Dr. Adam, to be a very common disease in Holland and he observes that, so far as he is aware it does not "eiis't inhot dry climates. It usually affects several ioints rarely a single one, unless at the hip, and is Sonly noticed to affect the joints syn^vnetrica ly -thus, the two knees, or both hips nun be in- volved.' Dr. Todd stated that it is to be observ d more among the labouring poor than among the higher classes. {On Gout and meumatu<m.) Ihronic rheumatic arthritis is an active disea e of the bones and fibrous expansions about the ? int: it is especially characterised by considerable ncrease in the size and by alteration in the sha^e 0 ti e osseous structures, which become porous m some parts, porcellaneous in others; by thickening of Sbro?s capsule of the joint, -it^ deposition^ of masses or plates of bone in it, and ultimate de- ruct n of tli^ cartilages and sy.-vial membranes The suffering is considerable : the disease greatly cHpples the Stility of the joint, at last produces m-. complete ankylosis of it, and mc'^'^'^^l';- j The invest gations into the disease made bj Dr..

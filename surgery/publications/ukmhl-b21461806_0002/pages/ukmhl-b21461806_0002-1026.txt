974 VENEREAL DISEASE. Symptoms.—Incipient mucous tubercles on labifi; Bquamous eruption on head, f'iice, and trunk, with roseola on limbs, of five weeks' duration ; multiple glandular enlargement in both groins. No pre- vious treatment. " St/pliilisalion.—Septembers.—After two failures with matter from hard sores, the inoculations were commenced successfully with matter obtained from multiple soft sores in a male out-patient (same as in Cases 2 and 3). From these the inoculations were continued through seventeen successive generations on each side of the chest till October 23, when the pustules became too small and imperfect to reinoculate from. " October 26.—Inoculations were made on the arms with matter originating in an indurated sore from a patient undergoing syphilisiition, which was sent from Norway by Dr. Bidenkap, and it went through five generations. After this, matter was employed on the arms and thighs (chiell}- from soft sores), and in one instance eleven genera- tions were produced on the thighs, but for the most part they terminated at the second or third. " After December 27 only very imperfect pustules were developed, and these never contained rein- oculable matter. Immunitj', therefore, may be said to have been attained in three months and twenty-two days. " Progress.—There was no improvement in the symptoms during the first two months of tlie treat- ment, but rather the contrary—fresh spots of eruption appeared, and the mucous tubercles on the labia increased in size. During the third month an amendment was apparent, and by the time the inoculations would no longer take the eruption had disappeared, as well as the mucous tubercles. " Result.—Left the hospital February 20, 1866 —five months and fifteen days from the com- mencement of the treatment—and has not since been heard of, 281 inoculations were made; 157 of these were positive, 124 negative. The longest series of pustules obtained from the same matter was seventeen (soft)." Table showing the duration of tJte treatment in each case and the number of inoculations made.

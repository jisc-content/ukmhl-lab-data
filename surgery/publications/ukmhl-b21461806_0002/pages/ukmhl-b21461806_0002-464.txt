OVARIOTOMY, 412 before the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in February 1859. Mr. Hutchinson was the first to follow up ovariotomy in 18.58. He had two successful cases in that year, and he assisted very materially in the progress of the operation by making his cases well known, and by the introduction of the clamp as a ready means of securing the pedicle, and of fixing it on the abdominal wall. Mr. Baker Brown, after an interval of more than four years since his second and last successful case, recommenced opera- ting, and had two successful cases in 1858, and two'in 1859 ; but six fatal cases in'the practice of the same operator, in 1869, somewhat retarded the progress of ovariotomy in the favourable opinion of the profession. Between his first case in February 1858, and March 1867, the writer has completed the opera- tion of ovariotomy in 200 cases. He has also commenced the operation but has not completed it, or has made simple exploratory incisions in cases of doubtful diagnosis, in eighteen other eases. In seven cases he has removed both ovaries ; four of the patients recovered. In two cases he has ex- tirpated the second ovary of a patient. One had ovariotomy performed eight months previously by another surgeon. Death followed on the seventh day. In the other case he successfully removed the right ovary, eighteen months after having re- moved the left. In one case the patient \yas pregnant, and the child was delivered by ceesarian section after removing the ovarian tumor. The mother is still alive and in excellent health. In the following table the number of these cases with the results are given in each year :— Completed ovariotomies Incomplete operations Exploratory incisions Year Recoveries Fatal Recoveries Fatal Recoveries Fatal 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1K63 1864 1865 1866 1367 up to March 3 6 4 6 16 18 25 26 31 3 5 2 5 5 13 9 8 14 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 I 1 1 1 2 1 1 138 63 6 4 6 2 Total -.

It is worthy of notice that increasing experience has been accompanied by diminishing mortality. A Of the first 100 patients, 66 recovered and 34 died. Of the second 100, 72 recovered and 28 died. Since 1858 many other surgeons have operated ith more or less success in London and the provinces, as well as in Scotland and Ireland. Lately Dr. Mackinnon in New Zealand, and Dr. Tracy, of Melbourne, have become the pioneers of ovariotomy at the antipodes. In America, Atlee, Peaslee, and others have performed a number of successful operations. In France this operation has made but tardy progress, notwithstanding Cazeaux's spirited and energetic advocacy at a meeting of the Academie de Medecine in 1856, and the writings of Charles Bernard {Archives Generales de Medecine, 1856) and Jules Worms {Gazelle Hebdom. 1860). In 1862 M. Ne'laton came to England, and witnessed several operations. On his return to Paris he operated himself and published a classical lecture, and from this time we maj' date the progress of ovariotomy in France ; although the operation had been performed before Ne'laton's visit in England, by Woyerkosky in 1844, Vaullegeard in 1847, Maisonneuve in 1829, Hugott, 1838, Boinet, Richard, Jobert de Lamballe, and Demarquay. Ne'laton performed his first operation in June 1862. Koeberle, of Strasbourg, has been his most successful compatriot but the operation has been performed by many French surgeons in Paris and the provinces. In Germany ovariotomy has been almost as unpopular as in France. Dieffenbach expressed himself dis- paragingly, and his contemporaries accepted the verdict. Crysman's and Dzondi's unfavourable results in 1819-21, brought the operation in still greater discredit. Dieffenbach, however, notwith- standing his former condemnation, operated in 1826 on a woman forty-four years of age. He made the incision in the linea alba, and extirpated a large ovarian tumor. He met with great diffi- culty in arresting the htemorrhage, but his opera- tion was crowned with success. Martini, Ritter, and others followed Dieffenbach's example, but with so little success that, during the period from 1826 to 1850, only three recoveries were achieved in twenty operations, and of eight incompleted operations five proved fatal. The most accomplished surgeons tried to redeem the reputation of ova- riotomy, but when men like Langenbeck, Kiwisch, lieyfelder, Schuh, Siebold, and Scanzoni failed, it is iiot surprising that for several years the ope- ration ceased to be practised. It is principally since 1862, after German surgeons had witnessed and studied the modifications and improvements m ovariotomy of their English brethren, and on their return operated with better success, that ovariotomy is finding its place among legitimate operations. The number of cases and monographs on this subject published in difTerent European languages spread the knowledge of the success of ovariotomy, and in rapid succession we hear of cases operated Total number of operations 218 150 68 31-19 The two cases alluded to above where ovariotomy upon with varying success in all parts of Europe. The first ovariotomy in Portugal was performed on February 7, 1866, at Lisbon by Dr. Antonio Barbosa. The patient died on the seventh day. Although in the present article we are restricted

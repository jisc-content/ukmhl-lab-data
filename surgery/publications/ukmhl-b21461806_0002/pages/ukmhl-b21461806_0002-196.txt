Subsequently to the publica- tion of Mr. Park's letter, he performed another ex- cision of the knee on the 22nd of June 1782, but the event was unsuccessful, as the patient lingered till the 13th of October, and then died. In 1783, the year following that of the pub- lication of Mr. Parks' pamphlet, the Bubject was brought before the Academy of Surgery In 1775 Justaraonde excised the elbow. In 178b, M Moreau excised the head of the humerus and th; glenoid cavity. In 1792, he operated on the elbol, and he and his son, several times, e^scised the articular surfaces of the knee, ankle shoulder, and wrist. Their example was followed by horn meillierand Baron Percy. . In 1809 Mulder, of Groningen, cut out a knee joint (See Wackier D^s, de Arlioulis extirpandis, 1810.) In 1819 M ■RoQx of Paris, performed the excision ol the Show. (See Revle Mid. 1830.) Tn 1823. the :L ;peration was executed Sir Phil.p Cramp^ ton, who has likewise excised t^J^. ^ success (see Duh.

Manj^successfu cases were however, performed both in Germany and Ir.ince, Jl ough the practice fell into disuse for a time in England, so that Sir P. Crampton's operation in m2, and Mr. White's, at the Westminster hos- pital (the removal of the head of the thigh bone ?n the latter), were considered quite a revival of the method. Yov the last revival of excision of joints British surgeons are indebted to Mr. Syme, and for Us present extension to Mr. Fergusson, more espe- cially in the larger and more important articulations. Sb e their revival and extension, these operations have continued to gain in favour, and are now, we ^;!r,constantl%ppliedtoallthearU^^^^^^ withou any exception. It is possible, as Mr. B rwell mentions in his work (0« D.eases of the Joints, p. 416), that several A-tu^^ns will y occur before their value is definitely fixed, je when we remember that they now constitute that department of surgery which has been termed the IrSi or, m'orJ correctly, the preser^a^e according to Mr. Erichsen there 6°°^ g~ for belle'ving that they have becoi^ie as much established in suitable cases requiring their pel Smance, as amputation is in those instances when the limb cannot be saved. . Mr. T. Holmes observes, on the subject o ex cision of joints : " In the upper extremity a m t any excision which affords a W°2''\^ro( tL ,Jto the patient the motion of Ae^elbojv, of^the JOINTS, EXCISION OF.

In the knee the question is more difficult, and the advantages of the stiff limb, left after even the most successful excision, over the artificial substitute (especially in the case of a wealthy person who can afford to purchase the ingenious artificial limbs now manu- factured), are not so great as to balance, in the minds of some surgeons, the increased danger to life which (as I fear we cannot help admitting) the operation entails, combined with the risk of failure, and of the necessity for consecutive ampu- tation. But there seems every reason for think- ing that excision of the knee will soon be gener- ally adopted in patients otherwise healthy, when the disease is only of limited extent, so as to be curable by the removal of thin slices of the affected bones."—-Sj/siem of Surgery, vol. 3. p. 8. We may briefly mention the conditions which call for excision'in preference to amputation. Caries and necrosis of the joint-ends of the bones, where the pain and discharge are so excessive that the patient would ultimately sink from ex- haustion. In certain incurable states of disease ol the membranes of the joints wherein the surround- ing soft parts are in a healthy condition. When amputation is not practicable, as in disease of the hip-joint, and of the temporo-inaxillary articula- tion. In crushing of one or more ot the jomt ends, without splintering of the body of the bones or injury to the main vessels and nerves ; in cer- tain wounds of the joints with lodgment of balls, and in bad compound dislocations and fractures especially in those of the head of the humerus and of the elbow, excision may be resorted to m pre- ference to amputation. In true osseous anky- losis of certain joints, as the knee and elbow, in which the limb is in a faulty position, the jomt may be excised in the manner first practised by Dr. Rhea Barton of Philadelphia, and s'nce fol- lowed both in the knee and elbow by Mr. Fer- Busson, Mr. Erichsen, Mr. Price, and many other Eeons in this country. Of coui'se there are mi ny circumstances which will regulate the nature " the operation ; for instance, if the extcW so parts are too much involved, it would be usele s L adopt excision: the same i'" « apphes to tle constitutional powers of the patient, for if he be h gh y Btrumoifs, or decidedly phthisical, he wi 1 K able to bear up through the long convales- cence which follows resection.

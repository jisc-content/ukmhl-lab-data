Violent pain [not due to inflammationj in the trunk or branch of a nerve, occurring in paroxysms of irregular duration, and after either irregular or regular intervals.—Copland. Neural- gia (derived from vevpov, a nerve, and liKyos, pain), a term signifying pain in a nerve, but first emploj'ed, 1 believe, by Chaussier as the name of a class of diseases, the chief character of which is excruciating pain in the trunk or filaments of some particular nerve, or in the nerves of some part of the body, independent of any inflammation or apparent disease in it. As Sir Benjamin Brodie remarks, the natural sensations of a part may be increased, diminished, or otherwise per- verted, although no disease exists in it which our senses are able to detect, either before or after death. There are, says he, other cases, in which the nerves of motion are affected, instead of those of sensation. Here there is involuntarj'- contrac- tion, or spasm of a particular set of muscles, or certain muscles lose their power of action alto- gether ; and yet, after death, the most minute dissection will demonstrate nothing in them dif- ferent from what would have been noticed if no spasm nor paralysis had ever existed. These facts are not difficult of explanation. " Every part to which a nervous filament can be traced, may be said to have its corresponding point in the brain or spinal marrow, and an impression, made either at its origin, or anywhere in the course of the trunk of a nerve, will produce effects, which are rendered manifest where the nerve terminates, or at that extremity which is most remote from the brain." (See Brodie On Local Nervous Affec- tions, p. 2.) In every case of neuralgia, therefore, one important indication always presents itself namely, that of inquiring whether there is any cause of irritation, affecting the trunk of the nerve, sufficient to account for the symptoms in the part, to which its ultimate filaments are distributed! Thus in one case, recorded by Sir Benjamin Brodie, the pressure of a femoral aneurism against some branches of the anterior crural nerve, which were kept on the stretch by the tumour, accounted for severe pain experienced at the inner side of the knee. In another case, a neuralgia, in the course of the peroneal nerve during life, was discovered after death to depend on a tumour on the left side of the hmibar vertebra, and extending into the pelvis, which had occasioned pressure on the origin of the sciatic nerve. Sometimes, as Sir Benjamin Brodie iias likewise explained, similar ellects take place, where the actual seat of disease is in the brain or spinal marrow. " Thus (says ' e) caries of the dorsal vertebra;, irritating the spinal marrow, produces pains and muscular spasms )f the lower limbs ; and the same disease, affectin" the superior cervical vertebrje, produces correspond- ing symptoms in the upper limbs." A gentleman complained of severe pains, referred to one tide of the abdomen. After having been fixed in one situation, they attacked another. No disease could be detected in the part apparently afll-cted and the pains were therefore regarded as nervous. It was observed, at tlic same time, that his powers of articulation were alfccted, and that he spoke in an indistinct and drawling manner. This seemed

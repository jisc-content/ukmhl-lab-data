64S SUPPURATION. Pus, when thin, lets fall an opaque deposit of corpuscles, leaving a thinner supernatant layer of Beruni. In some cases it is so dense that not a drop of clear liquor can be separated. It is not known to coagulate spontaneously. In the rabbit, after wounds and experiments, collections of pus form under the skin, constituting firm cheesy crumbling masses, covering the whole animal like a coat of mail. (Kiihne, Lehrbucli der physiolo- gischen Chemie, Leipxifl, 18'j8.) (h) Chemical Composilion and Qualities.—Pus yields in chemical analysis, according to Gorup iesanez, as consiaul ingredients—Water, albumen, fats (oleates and palraitates of glycerine), soaps (oleates and pahnitates of alkalies), cholestearin, cerebric acid, and phosphorised fat, extractive with leucin ; salts, espectaUy chloride of sodium,alkaline phosphates aud carbonates, sulphate of lime, earthy phosphates and iron. Occasional ingredients—Mucus, pyin, casein (?) chondrin, gluten, chlorodiuio acid, pyocyanlu bile acids and pigments, sugar and urea. The solids of pus vary very much in quantity in different cases. Thus, Scherer found 12*8 per cent, in the pus of a psoas abscess just opened, aud only 4 per cent, in the thin alkaline discharge some days afterwards. Usually, they are from 10 to 16 per cent., and when burned leave 5 or G of inorganic ash, of which chloride of sodium is the most abundant ingredient. According to Nasse, 1000 parts of pus serum contain r2'6 of chloride of sodium ; 100 parts of ash of pus contain 72*33 of the same. It specially belongs to the serum. {Kuhne.) The following table, extracted from Gorup Besanez {Texll/ook of Physioloyical Chemislri/, Bruitsivick, 1862), gives an interesting view of the relative composition of liquor sanguinis, serum, and pus:— In 1000 Parts Water ....

H.Dickinson {Med.-Cliii: Trans, vol. 1. p. 48) calls attention to the fact that the analyses of pus in Simon's Chemistry by Gu.erboch and Valentin show the soluble or alkaline salts of its ash to be to the insoluble in the proportion of 5 to 0'7, and in another case of 4-7 to 0 62, According to Nasse, in 1000 parts of blood serum the alkaline salts amounted to 7-1; in 1000 parts of pus serum to 15-32. Lehmann affirms that the ash of pus contains 6 9 per cent, of potass, whilst the ash of blood contains only 4 8 per cent. This chemist infers that " the ash of pus always con- tains a larger quantity of phosphates and potass than the intercellular fluid of the corresponding blond." Dr. Dickinson shows that in the case of a child with dilated bronchi, who coughed up daily about 3| ounces of pus, tliis contained •!)-22 grammes of mineral matter, of which -867 gramme (about 13 grains) was alkaline, and -0.55 earthy. The alkalies consisted of soda -275, potass In pus from a psoas abscess, 100 parts contained, of potass -604, soda '476, earthy salts -2. The significance of these analyses will be adverted to presently. Tlie cells of freshly-formed pus, says Kiihne, exactly resemble white blood corpuscles, and ex- hibit lively contractile movements. Fine glancing particles are more abundant in pus corpuscles than in white blood-cells, and nuclei are rather more numerous. Indented nuclei appear to be always )ii()duced when pus loses its vitality, especially on the addition of water or diluted acid. The fine particles are supposed to be fatty. Changes in pus are speedily induced by standing, especially in a warm place. By the addition of salts, pus can with some difficulty be filtered and its corpuscles separat d. When the thickish mass lel't behind has been washed with water, and then with a ten per cent, solution of common salt, a thick slimy mass is formed, which is precipitated with water. This precipitate gives the recictions of myosin. {Hoppe- Seyler.) Pus serum closely resembles blood serum ; it is fibrino-plastic, it contains para globu- lin, and after being treated with carbonic acid it throws down a precipitate with dilute acetic acid (albuminate of potass), and it coagulates like blood serum at a temperature of about 167° F. (76° C.) from the serum-albumen it contains. Ac- cording to Hoppe also it contains myosin. The pus of abscesses may be either strongly acid, or strongly alkaline from annuonia produced by decom- position, and besides the above components may contain protagon, cholestearin, soap, free, fixed, aud volatile fatty acids, glutin, chondrin, leucin, tyro- sin, xanthin, chlorodinic acid, pyocyanin, bili- rubin, urea, and sugar. As to tlie existence of casein in pus, the albuminate of potass already alluded to is identical with this substance. {Kiihiic.) Of the bodies nearly allied to these albu- minoid substances, mucin, chondrin, and glutin might be looked for in pus. Mucin has not, how- ever, been discovered, nhhough carefully sought for by H. Fischer; but Biideker has iound the two others in abscesses following congestion several times in association, but glutin alone^ he only

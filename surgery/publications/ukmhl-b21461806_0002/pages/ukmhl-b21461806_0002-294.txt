Women suffer less from stone than men, and far less frequently stand in need of litho- tomy. It is not, however, that their urine will not so readily produce the concretions which are termed urinary calculi. The reason is alto- gether owing to the shortness, largeness, and very dilatable nature of the female urethra ; circum- stances which render the expulsion of the stone with the urine the comhion result. The records of surgery present us with numerous instances where calculi of vast size were spontaneously voided through the meatus urinarius, either sud- denly without pain or after more or less time and suifering. Heister mentions several well-authen- ticated examples. Middleton has also related a case, where a stone weighing four ounces was expelled in a fit of coughing, after lodging in the passage a week. Colot speaks of another instance, where a stone, ahout as large as a goose's egg, after lying in the meatus urinarius seven or eight days, and causing a retention of urine, was voided in a paroxysm of pain. A remarkable case is related by Dr. Molineux in the early part of the Phil. Trans'.: a woman voided a stone, the cir- cumference of which measured the longest way seven inches and six-tenths, and round ahout where it was thickest five inches and three-quar- ters ; its weight being near two ounces and half 'troy. And Dr. Yelloly has related an in- teiesting example, in which a calculus, weighing three ounces three-and-a-half drachms troy, and lodged in the meatus uriiifirius, was easily taken out with the lingers. (Seejl/ei/. Chir. Trans, vol. vi. p. 577.) Dr. Yelloly also refers to several other remarkable instances, described in the Philoso- phical Transactions (vols. xii. xv. xvii. xx. xxxv. xlii. and Iv.), proving what large stones will pass out of the female urethra, either spontaneously or with the aid of dilatation and manual assist- ance. Were any doubts now left of this tact, they would be immediately removed by other histories, especially those contained m the papers by Sir A. Cooper. (See Med. Chir. Trans, vols, viii. and xii.)

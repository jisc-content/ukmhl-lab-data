This organ is subject to various diseases, as inflammation, ul cers, cancers, paralysis, tumors, and a rapid swell- ing of it, sometimes causing imminent danger of suffocation. When any morbid action is set up in the tongue many things contribute to maintain it. " The extreme mobility of the organ ; the almost con- tinual use of it in eating, drinking, iind speaking ; the contact of the teeth, which arc often irregular and decayed, are quite sufficient to interrupt any efforts to restore a healthy action. It often hap pens, too, that the part is so very tender that the patient cannot bear to cleanse the mouth and teeth, which soon become iiicrusted; and, from this source alone, the complaint will be greatly aggravated, and the discharge rendered fetid and irritating." /A. Ear!,^, in ^rcd. Chir. Trans. ><il. xii. p. 2113.) The matta- with which the teeth become incrusted in these cases is composed of phosphate of lime and mucus ; and in a case recorded by Palctta the quantity of it was very considerable. Carious teeth, with points and inequalities, producing continual irritation, are the most fre- quent cause of ulcerations of the tongue. The sores thus arising often resist every kind of remedy, and ignorance of the cause sometimes leads the practitioner to consider them as irreme- diable ; whereas a cure may easily be effected by extracting the carious tooth, or simply filing off ts sharp irregularities, as was anciently directed by Celsus. Glossitis.—Dr. Graves has recorded the par- ticulars of an interesting case of tin idiopathic glossitis, affecting only one half of the tongue, the median line forming a perfect boundar}' be- tween the swollen and the healthy parts. The swelling nearly filled the entire cavity of the mouth, which coiiM scarcely be closed on account of the protrusion of the tongue. " Two or three applications of six leeches at a time to the in- flamed half, part of which at my first visit, appeared on the verge of gangrene, produced a speedy decrease of the tumor and the inflam- mation. The bleeding from the leech-bites was very great. In consequence of the detumescence of the tongue, articulation and deglutition, which before had been very difficult, were quickly re- stored. The patient is at present (two years since the attack) able to speak perfectly, although the left half of his tongue is still perceptibly increased in size." (Dr. Graves, in Dubli?i Hospital Reports, vol. iv. p. 43.) As this gentleman has observed, true idiopathic glossitis is an extremely rare disease. J. P. Frank only saw one case of it during his whole life. In none of the four cases observed of late years in different parts of Europe was the in- flammation limited to one Jtalf of the tongue. (See Elbuig in Graefe and Walther's Journ. b. vii. 2 tes. Heft and Edinb. Journ. of Med. Science, No. i.) The disease is formidable and tedious, unless blood be taken directly from the tongue. For this pur- pose Dr. Graves prefers leeches both to incisions in the dorsum of this organ and to puncturing the sublinguiil veins. For further information on idiopathic glossitis, a paper by Orgill may be referred to. (See Glasgoio Journ. vol. iv.) The whole of the tongue sometimes inflames, and becomes considerably enlarged, either spon- taneously and without any apparent cause, or in consequence of some other disease ; or else fnnu some particular irritation, such as that of mercury, or some poisonous substance. Slegel, who was at Paris about the middle of the 17th centurj-, saw a patient in a salivation, whose tongue became so enormously enlarged that the mouth could not contain it. Pimprinelle, an eminent surgeon of that time, was sent for, and finding that all trials to relieve the affection were in vain, amputated one half of the tongue, with the view of preventnig its, mortification. After the wound had healed it is said the patient could articulate very well. Louis, from whom this fact is quoted, justly remarks that the measure resorted to by Pimprinelle was nn exceedingly violent one, for he had often seen urgent symptoms, occasioned during a salivation by a rapid and enormous swelling of the tongue, quickly yield to bleeding, purgative clysters, change

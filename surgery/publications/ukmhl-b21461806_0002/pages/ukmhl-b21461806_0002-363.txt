MORTIFICATION bonis*, cataplasmn cerevisitef, and the cataplasuia eltervescens.f [Tlie first object of local applications is to soothe and comfort tlie living tissues ; or to give them some gentle stimulation, to excite them to form a healthy line of demarcation, and cast off the sloughs. Again, they may be used to nuimmify and disinfect the dead and decomposing sloughs, so that the air shall not be made unpleasant, nor the patient's blood be contaminated by the absorption of putrid matter. Ihe hrst object is generally accomplished by warm linseed meal poultices. The second by the car- bonic acid poultice ; poultices of beer grounds carrots, &c. ointments of Peruvian balsam, or cre- osote ; weak lotions of mineral acids. The third indication is be.t carried out by the liquor soda; chlorinatfe and creosote or carbolic acid. Here we speak of mortification in its usual sense. For slough- ing ulcers phagedena, &c., many other applications are described elsewhere, as strong solution of opium ; bromine is the best remedy in hospital gangrene according to the evidence of the Ame- ZZ^ '^""'^ surgeons. The various cauterants, actual and potential, and their applications, are de- sciiDea under the head of Hospital Gang RENE. I in tiie_ gangrene produced by pressure and weakness in persons who are compelled by diseases and injuries to lie for weeks and months „ one posture, the mode of treatment is a matter of ex! tteme importance and frequently makes the dif- ference ot life or death to the poor sufferers. This affection usual y has its seat in parts which are but thinly covered with muscular flesh. It occurs towards the latter stages of long continued febri e diseases as after typhus, or hec?ic fever, attended f vers n,T' ^"Pr^ti"" • or even without these ZZ ' u P^^''''y^''' and in bad compound frac- Te lJr"'''Vl^'- "''^^"•e^. there which L ^"^'"g Pi-e=^n«, 'ated O "'r^' "^^'^ '^""'•^"^ly discrimi-' lated.

A cir cular hollow pillow will often accomplish tliTs important object; but, when possible, an entire cbange of posture is to be preferred. In these in- stances, I must not forget to recommend the water- bed, for which the public are indebted to Dr. Arnott and which acts by nicely equalizing the pressure' on every point of the body on which the^atient lies, so that he may experience no greater pressure on any one part than if he were floating on the surface of water. ° When sphacelus succeeds to gangrene from pres- sure, I have often seen camphorated spirit applied but not with decided advantage. A common'^emoi: lient poultice, and in very bad cases, the topical use of the solution of opium along the living margin are the means upon which I place most reliance care being taken to improve the general health without which grand indication, neither the re- moval of the pressure, nor the virtues of any dress- 2hl '"'^ .^'T''- T'"""^"" ^P'^"!" most highly of the fermenting poultice, which I believe to be in these cases an excellent application.

Ihe back, &c., should be daily washed with soap and water If possible, and be well dried with soft napkins; then dabbed with eau de cologne or other spirit. Brodie recommended a solution of two grains of corrosive sublimate to an ounce of spirit.! When mortification arises from cold, every sort avoi'der.nT"' application must at first be ployed, (bee Chilblains). ' The gangrenous affection of the pudenda to which female children are liable, was successfullv treated by Mr. K.

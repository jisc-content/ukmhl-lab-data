JOINTS, EXCISION OF. was bilious vomiting, tenderness and fulness of the epigastrium, and always constipation and highly- coloured scanty urine. The constitutional symp- toms, viewed in connection with the local, strik- ingly resembled those accompanying phlebitis. Dr. McUowal describes the post 7norlem appearances, and refers to the inefficiency of ordinary treatment. (See Dublin Jour, of Med, Science, vol. iii. p. 382, and vol. ii. p. 1.) Dr. McDowal's description corresponds to that of Mr. Coulson, and applies to the same class of affections which are clearly the result of poisoning of the blood, and now recognised as pyaemia.] 147 nomas H.

This operation con- sists in the removal of the parts of bones, entering into the formation of a diseased joint, together with the whole of the capsular ligament and synonial membrane. " It has a two-fold object: the first 13 to remove a formidable disease, and this might be effected by amputation; the second is to pre- serve a useful limb, and this amputation could not eitect. ihe fact m morbid anatomy, on which the proposal mainly rests, is, that, in the large majo- rity ot the ulcerative diseases of joints, the bone ia either^ primarily affected or becomes so second- arily. (See Blackburn, in Gufs Hospital Re- ports, vol. 1. 0. S. p. 277.) [The first notice of any case of removing a por- .on or the ^y^^ole, of a diseased joint, is reported Y.?''-i°^i.° P'""'^ Schlicliting in 1742; the head ot the thigh bone was extracted in a case of hip- jomt disease by a surgeon whose name is not men- tioned.

With the exception of the cases ;f Mr" Wainman and Filkin, however, in uU these ex amples only one articular surface was removed" I lie merit of suggesting the operation, as defined .a the first sentence of this article, unquestionably belongs to Mr Henry Park of Liverpool.

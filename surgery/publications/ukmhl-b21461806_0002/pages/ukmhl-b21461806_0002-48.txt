oo INFLAMMATION, Thus far, tlien, we see tliat irritation of the ramifications of a nerve produces increased sensi- bility of the trunk. But from the trunl?, the increased sensibility radiates, in a reflex manner, to the neighbouring ramifications ; hence the exten- sion of ienderness to a distance around an mjury. A common example of reflected nervous irrita- tion is seen in some cases of ovarian disturbance m women ; and as I have before said, it is m the female generative system that the true natural type of inflammation and its processos^ )s_ .0 be found In a patient afltected with irritation or neuralgia of the right ovary, I_ have often seen the whole right leg and foot crimson, warm, and with its veins turgid, whilst the opposite foot and kg were pale and cold. A-rain, there is direct evidence showing the in- fluence of the spinal nerves in creating, or at least promoting, general febrile disturbance after local injury. " When a horse," says Claude Bernard "has injured itself by stepping on a sharp stone, or a pointed fragment ot metal, ti e general phenomena (fever and inflammation) wi H ^vhich similar accidents are usually attended, will not take place if the sensitive nerve leading to the wound be divided, and none but local symp- toms will in this case be observed. If, on the contrary, instead of cutting the nerve, we create a local hy^ereesthesiaby dividing the spmal cord on tliat side, the opposite effects will be produced ; the pain, fever, and inflammation resulting from ihe wmmd will acquire at once additional in- Hitherto we have spoken of the spinal nerves; buf of the direct influence also on the circulation of th se nerves which are derived from the sym- Sthet c, there can be no doubt, although here ,s much yet to be learned on this matter It seems r£ established that the ^l-^-ve-e s are uader the influence of two sorts of nerves . one (\_asi motor) probably directly derived from the spinal Tord, vhich accelerates the ci->ilatioii and p^o- duces dilatation and increased flow of blood ; the other derived from the cord through the sympa- thedc which produces contraction of thenr mid diminishes the'flow of blood. "The division of the nerves belonging to the ^y.^'^'";^ "/S^ , f' . says Claude Bernard, that is, of the latter 01 S'mpatLtic class, " gives rise to three grea cLses of morbid phenomena: 1st, an acce kiaton of the passage of the blood through the vessels 2nd an increase of temperature ; 3rd, an exa?geiated a<;tivity of the secretions besides ^vhicl , the part can resist cold for a longer time, and is ve y ^much more sensitive. If one cervical branch be divided in a rabbit, the corresponding eai becomes hot and vascular, and not only so, but the corre- spondin- side of the brain and its membranes as w^d All these eft-ects are re^•el■sed li the peri- sh ral extremity of the divided '^-^ \«J " Lized so as to restore its contract eft.a .

(See Claude Bernard's "and Fu,>cticns 0/ Spinal Cord, Med. l>mes and Gaz, 18G1.) If we may attempt to show by a rough ana- lo'TY the relative share which the nutritive action ot-a tissue, the composition of the blood, and the influence of tiic nervous system, take in modifying the distribution of blood, we may liken the organic actions in any given tissue to the con- sumption of co.lin afurnace-the blood to the coal-tho nerves to the persons by whose agency the coal is fetched. Then it will be manifest tha the quantity of coal consumed will depend partly on the amount of work to be done, or of steam to be raised by the furnace ; partly by the quality of the coal and its power of quick combus- tion; Lid partly by the activity of the persons whose place it is to bring it. _ We will now examine the various causes ot inflammation, which may be divided into two lieads, local and constitutional, or sohdist and A" moral Each kind requires to be carefully studied andanalysed, although it must not be supposed that they're often met with absolutely distinct ,n nature 'A true severe inflammation, local only, that is produced by local irritation without any concumn blood disorder, is most rare, because local inflam- mation may poison the whole blood. 1 The local causes are those which disturb the nutrition of the part, which interfere with the steady development of the elements of tissues, or which ; odu?e premature wear and tear of them, or hinder he removal of their debris, when eifete. Clf these the chief and most frequent is over-e,^it on or the compelling an organ to do more work, that is, to go through the processes of disintegration and re lewll more frequently than it is well able to do so. Inflammations of over-worked mamm^B and eyes are examples. Aliermtions of iemperaiuie, which perplex and disturb the changes going on n he blood, and alter the relation of the tissues 0 oxygen ; of which chilblains and sunburn are eLmples. Injuries of every sort ^^^^^^^-^ chanical or chemical, or iiiiuries produced by those pofsJns which hav'e no force save ^P- I-^g matter as the zymotic or septic poisons. Not that Se's are of iiecessity followed by inflammation : for after almost any ainount of injury, even inclu- ding destruction of the vitality of a neighboimng mr? a part may tranquilly undergo reparation. Yet those injuri s which leave parts ha f killed, or Jo i cumstai^ced that the FO^-fj'^XioTs interfered with, or the development of exuda 101 s hhidered, or th^ fluids about the wound made to u dergo 'putrescent changes, are sure to niflame. Thus a simple cut, nicely closed, may not inflame But if it be not brought together or if t be fudely torn open again, so as to >nterlere with the vitality of the reparative exudation whilst still leSer or if the reparative material be allowed to pu r v,"^' decomposing ^ima natter, iiiflammati.ni is sure to result. 1 he more complex an injury, such as a torn wound, 01 T n which foreign-bodies are entangled the mme li^vble is it to inflame. The poisons of aniim U, arsiiake bites, and stiugs of all sorts ; ve^-ta^^^^^^ irritants ; putrid and decomposing animal matt, is nd the discharges from inflamed ^'^^'^'T'^ or serous, applied to the like parts iii th .c body or another, are also common causes of local inflammation.

SPINE, CUR^ ATURES OF. G19 angles of the ribs in the dorsal, and tlie transverse ])roct'3ses in the lumbar region, are depressed or sunk inwards to a corresponding extent. And as already shown the lateral deviation of the apices of tiie spinous processes bears no definite or con- stant relation to the lateral deviation of the bodies of the vertebraj—that an extreme degree of inter- nal curvature may exist without any lateral devia- tion of the spinous processes, and that, as an invariable rule, the internal curvature exists to a much greater extent than the external curvature— it follows that the posterior projection of the angles . of the ribs in the dorsal region, and of the trans- verse processes in the lumbar region, may be more ceitiinly relied upon than any condition of the Bpiiious processes, as indicating the existence of internal curvature, or lateral deviation of the bodies of the vertebraj. This condition of horizon- tal rotation of the bodies of the vertebise in lateral curvature was first described by Dr. Duds, of Bath, in the year 1824, and subsequently by Mr. J. Shaw, Bouvier, Sir Charles Bell, Gu^rin, and other authorities. But the existence of internal without any ex- ternal curvature, or lateral deviation of the apices of the spinous processes, either in severe cases such as that already described, or as a constant patho- logical condition in slight cases, and the means of detecting this deviation have notj as far as I am aware, been previously described. All the authorities on spinal curvature who have described rotation of the vertebrae regard this con- dition as a late change, a complication, or a super- added condition of lateral curvature, which they consider essentially to be a lateral deviation of the spinal column, caused by muscular weakness be- fore rotation takes place; but a careful study of this affection has led me to consider that horizontal rotation of the bodies of the vertebrse occurs in all cases of lateral curvature, as a constant and essen- tial condition of this affection, however slight the deviation may be, and that it occurs in a large number of cases before any lateral deviation of the apices of the spinous processes—the indication generally relied upon as diagnostic of lateral cur- vature—takes place. I need hardly saj', however, it does notexibt in those cases of muscular debility or wmk spines, which are too often assumed by some practitioners to be cases of lateral curvature, and treated as such, with wonderfully good results, under any and every mode of treatment. Diminution in HeiylU of the Spinal Column.— When lateral deviation of the spinous processes takes place—coexistingas it necessarily does, though not to a proportionable extent, with horizontal rotation of the bodies of the vertebrw—we have in addition to the posterior projection of the angles o' the ribs in the dorsal region, and of the transverse processes in the lumbar region, a positive loss in height of the spinal column, proportionate to the extent of the lateral deviation; so that the general alteration which takes place in the conformation of the chest in severe cases of lateral curvature, de- pends upon the combined influence of horizontal rotiition of the bodies of the vertebra;, and lateral flexion of the spinal column. In addition to the spiral twist, and the diminu- tion in height from lateral deviation, there is another peculiarity in the form assumed by the spinal column in the so-called lateral curvature, simultaneously with the other deviations, viz.: The Obliteration of the Natural Curves in the Antero-Posteriur Direction.—In cases of double cur- vature of a moderate degree of severity, when unaccompanied by a stoop or falling forwards of the head from a curvature in the upper dorsal region, we may generally observe a flattening, and in soma instances a positive depression, instead of the natural convexity of the middle dorsal region. This has been previously alluded to when describ- ing the external appearances in cases of double curvature, as one of the most unfavourable indica- tions : there can be no doubt that it depends upon rotation of the bodies of the vertebrae ; also indi- cated in these cases by the altered relations of the angles of the ribs, and therefore it is a certain and reliable evidence of the existence of internal cur- vature of the spine, necessarily accompanied by certain structural changes, even though there may be no lateral deviation, or, as more frequently occurs, a comparatively slight deviation of the apices of the spinous processes. In the more severe cases of curvature with conspicuous external deformity, a careful examination will show that the prominence on the side of the convexity essen- tially depends upon the posterior projection of the angles of the ribs, and even in these cases there is frequently no posterior projection of the spinous processes. In some cases, however, espe- cially in what are called large sinyle curves, accom- panied by a stoop, the spinous processes project posteriorly in the general yielding of the spinal column. In the so-called lateral curvature in the lumbar region, the normal curve in the antero posterior direction is also frequently obliterated, this portion of the spine appearing in profile view to be re- markably straight. Ill articulated skeletons exhibiting spinal cur- vature, and in dried specimens preserved in nmseums, this obliteration of the natural curves of the spine in the antero-posterior direction may be traced not only in spinous processes, but in the outline formed by the bodies of the vertebrEe when viewed in profile. Sometimes the natural cur- vatures are even reversed, and this was remarkably conspicuous in the specimen above adverted to. In my description of this specimen in the Medical Chirurgical Transactions, I observed, " Viewed in profile, or from its lateral aspect, the natural curve of the spine in the lumbar region is seen to be reversed ; and, instead of presenting a convexity forwards, the three upper lumbar vertebrtc, to- gether with the twelfth dorsal, present anteriorly a concave outline. This is not produced by any absorption or destruction of the bodies of tlm vertebrro anteriorly, but is evidently caused by the very remarkable degree of rotation above de- scribed, by which the natural anterior convexity in this region is made to assume a lateral position as if the spinal column had been laterally twisted on its vertical axis, the centre of motion beinn- fixed at the apices of the spinous processes. ° The general effect of this obliteration of the normal curves in the antero-posterior direction is to produce externally the appearance of a straight- ening of the spine as far as the profile view of the apices of the spinous processes is concerned, and in examining cases of spinal curvature this con- dition may frequently be noticed. Having now described the general direction and form assumed by the vertebral column in the

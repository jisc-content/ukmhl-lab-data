INFLAMMATION. 12 reflex actions. Thus in inflammation of any surface there will probably be spasm, or irregular action of the surrounding muscles ; — of the ephmcter m dysentery; of the orbicularis in conjunctivitis; of the constrictors of the larynx in croup, and so forth. These muscular actions form an important part of the pain of many inflammations, and aggra- vate the difiiculties of treatment. In the third place the pain of inflammation may be connected with the intensity of the hypersemia; mass of blood may he raised two or three degrees ; and the Uat of an inflamed part may rise nearly or quite to the heat of iJie general mass of the blood, but not beyond. The usual heat of the blood may be stated in round numbers as 100°. In fever, especially scarlet fever, it has been stated to rise so hi^rh as 10B°, 108°, or even 112°. {Dateman, On Cutaneous Disease, 1819, p. 74.)

Conversely, inflammation of loose areolar tissue, or of the substance of the lung where there is no distention, is less painful than inflammation of parts that are themselves unyielding, or bounded by others which are so. Further, it must be noticed that, in some cases the pain of an inflamed organ is not felt at the part, but at a distance ; of which the instances commonly quoted are, pain in the shoulder from diseased liver; pain of the knee from diseased hip, and of the testicle from diseased kidney or ure- thra These are illustrations of the fact that irri- tation of any one part of any nerve may be felt at any other part of its course. . Closely allied to pain is the condition called tenderness, which is almost universal in inflamma- tion, and betokens an exalted sensibility, so that any touch or pressure gives pain. _ Lastly, it must be noticed that pain may be aTjsent —as in many slight inflammations of the skin, or pleura, and in inflammations of a slow lingering character. In such cases it may be said that no pain is created. In others, though created it is not felt. This is the case in inflammation ot Higher than that of the blood, as they have some- what of a classical character, deserve to be quoted at some length:— , , , r . ''• Experiment I. A man had the operation foi the radical cure of the hydrocele perfornied at bt. George's Hospital. When I opened the tunica vaginalis I immediately introduced the ball of the thermometer into it, and close by the «de of the testicles the mercury rose exactly to 92 . Ihe cavity was filled with lint, dipped in salve, that it might be taken out at will: the next day, when inflammation was come on, the dressings were taken out, and the ball of the themometer mtro- duced as before, when it arose to 981° exactly. " Here was an increase of heat of 6j° bu even this (heat) was^not equal to that of the blood, ^'""Experiment II. I made an incision into the thorax of a dog ; the wound was made about the centre of the right side, and the thermometer pushed down so as to come into contact or nearly so, with the diaphragm. The degree of heat was 101°- a large dossil of lint was put into the wound to prevent its healing by the first intention, and covered over by a sticking-plaster. Tue dog was affected by a shivering.

Now as the heat of th abdomen was 104°, we must, I think suppose that the general heat of the man would also be other experiments were made by provoking in- flammation in the internal secreting surfaces of womids; as the rectum and vagina of dogs and asses ■ and it was found that the most vivid inflam- mation that could be excited by injections of corrosive sublimate did not raise the temperature above that of the blood generally. But that which was rendered prohab e bj the common instincts of mankind, and - neriments of Hunter were too coarse to dispro> e, uTich Liebig also nffirraed on a prion grounds, namely!;rhat'the heat of an inflamed part is really fever. Ttri"ctly speaking,'pain is a condition of the brain and spinal cord; not of the part af Secondly. In treating oithe Iwat of inflammation we must distinguish, first, the patient's sensa tions of heat, which are often quite disproportionate to the reality. Secondly, we may state it as a fact, that an inflamed part is generally hotter to the touch and to the thermometer than parts in its vicinity. Dr. Spurgin who has paid great a - tentionto this subject, and has constructed a lUcd thermometer for the purpose ot making accurate obser^^itions, informs the writer that he has seen , . " ' , ^,,1.

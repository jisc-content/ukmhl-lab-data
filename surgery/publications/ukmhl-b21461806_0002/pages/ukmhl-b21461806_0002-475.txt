keeping up the strength of the patient. Stimu- lants, as brandy, champagne, &c., are given when thej' are called for by failing pulse and other signs of exhaustion. Very little food is required durmg the first days after the operation; barley-water, toast and water, gruel, bread and milk, or any other light nourishment are often sufficient, but the re- quirements of the individual case will always be the best guides. Flatulence, often a very trouble- some symptom, may be relieved by passing the elastic tube of an enema apparatus up the rectum. An enema of five grains of quinine in an ounce of water, with or without a few drops of laudanum, repeated every four hours, has often relieved flatu- lence by restoring the tone of the muscular coat of the intestines. The urine often becomes loaded with lithates, or a sediment highly coloured with purpurine forms, in which case citrate of potass may be given freely and with evident advantage. The stitches are removed on the third or fourth day after the operation, by which time the wound \n\\ 'have united. If the patient is very stout, the union will be slower and the stitches may be left longer. Suppuration around the stitches, which sometimes takes place, causes a little feverish- ness, but is not of much consequence. The clamp comes off at varying periods, from three to fifteen days. The patients are often un- conscious of it, and it is better not to remove it, unless it is held by some mere shred of dead tissue. The bowels are kept quiet after the operation, and as long as the patient feels comfortable their action need not be brought on. An enema of warm water or a dose of castor oil will bring on their action if not spontaneous. Accumulation of hard foecal masses in the rectum may cause tenesmus, keep up a spurious diarrhosa, and thus render the patient uncomfortable. Their pre- sence wiU be discovered by digital examination. They should be broken up with the finger or a spoon, and the bowels afterwards cleared by in- jecting warm water. If the first motion fatigues the patient and renders her restless, it will be ad- visable to have it followed by an opiate enema. An occurrence a few days after the operation often causes apprehension—the so-called unexpected reappearance of the catamenia. This uterine dis- charge, however, is not the result of the periodical rupture of a Graafian follicle and escape of the ovum arrived at maturity (a fact impossible when the operation has been performed a few days after the cessation of the catamenial flow), but an occurrence generally followed by relief, also observed in some fevers, acute inflammation of some internal organs, and after surgical operations. TJiis uterine dis- charge has been called by Gubler uterine epistaxis; the writer proposes the use of the term mclroataixis. After the recovery of the patient an abdominal belt ought to be worn for some months. As a rule, very perfect health follows the operation. No special ill-effect has been observed, even when both ovaries have been removed. The occurrence of disease in the sound ovary left has been ex- tremely rare. Neither pregnancy nor delivery have been unusually troublesome in any patient who has recovered after the performance of ovariotomy by the writer. The statistics of his own practice have been given in a former column. Those of other sur- geons are summed up by Mr. Clay, of Birmingham, in his recent prize essay in the following table:— QVARIOTOMY. 423 GENERAL RESULTS OP OVARIAN OPERATIONS.

346 NECROSIS. free outlet for the matter 'formed, as well ns for any small fragments of bone tliat may be left : it also compels the wound to granulate from the bottom, and thus the cavity becomes effectually closed. The sequestra which are occasionally met with in the stumps of bones after amputation vary much in size and shape; sometimes, when the periosteum has been detached, a shell consisting of the external layers of the bone will exfoliate; at others, a small ring of bone, comprising the entire thickness of the shaft, will separate; this form is com- monly met with when the soft parts have retracted or sloughed, leaving the end of the bone exposed. But a much more extensive loss of substance may take place from inflammation of the medullary tissue, when it has sustained injury from the action of the saw during the operation, or from the acci- dent which necessitated amputation. In these cases the sequestrum is of a conical shape, com- prising the whole thickness of the stump of the bone at its extremity, and gradually tapering away to a thin shell, which is formed by the inter- nal lamellae of the shaft: these deeper layers have suffered necrosis in consequence of inflammation of the medulla, and are ensheathed in the cortex of the bone, which has become consolidated and thickened by deposit of osseous matter upon its surface and between its layers. When completely detached, one of these seques- tra may be drawn out of its bony sheath in the form of a cylinder, which consists of the entire ■walls of the medullary canal, and may extend the whole length of the stump. In the museum of St. Mary's Hospital is a [specimen fully nine inches long, extracted from the femur of a person after amputation. The external surface of these sequestra is very rough and irregular, as is also, but to a less extent, the interior of the bones from which they have been withdrawn: on re- moving one of-these necrosed pieces, the inner surface of the shaft from which it has separated is seen to be lined with granulations which ulti- mately form the medullary membrane. In such cases, chronic inflammation is kept up in the stump, and a free discharge of matter will often continue for several months ; the strength of the patient must be maintained until the seques- trum becomes loose, when it can be readily with- drawn by means of forceps, and the wound quickly heals ; sometimes, however, an incision may be required to facilitate its extraction. This form of necrosis used to be very common when caustics and escharotics were applied to the stump after ampu- tation, but since this practice has been discontinued, and early union of the flaps promoted, it is rarely met with, or only to a very slight extent. Louis (Mem, sur la saillia de I'os apres Venn- putaiion cles memb.), Veyrat {Mevt. sur ^ la resectioji apres Vamput. de la cuisse), and others advocated, before the Academy of Surgery of Paris, amputation of the necrosed bone above the level of the soft parts: but Leveilld (Sur la Maladic qui affcda les bouts des os ajO)'('s Vamput. des memb.) and Desruelles (Necrose des os amptil(s) recom- mended delay in operative proceedings until the dead portion of bone had separated, and this prac- tice is now followed almost universally. In certain cases, where the surface of the bone has peribhcd from inflammation or destruction of the periosteum, »t has been proposed to destroy the medulla ns high as the necrosed external layers, and thus ensure the separation of the whole thickness ol the bone, but the very obvious dangers attending such a procedure have prevented its adoption. It sometimes happens that the dead bone may be separated from its articular ends, or removed by operation, before the new bone has acquired suf- ficient strength to resist the action of the muscles, and splints must then be applied to the limb to prevent shortening or distortion. After a necrosis, the patient must not be allowed to use the lower extremity until the new bone is consolidated and able to support the weight of the body : in con- sequence of neglecting this precaution, fractures have occurred through the newly-formed bone ; and, although union has generally taken place, j'et the recovery is slow and tedious, and in some few instances it has been imperfect, so that a false joint has resulted, necessitating amputation of the limb.] {G.

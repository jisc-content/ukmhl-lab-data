SPINE, CURVATURES OF, increase of curvature in the lumbar region, although taking place to a less extent than in the dorsal, is accompanied by a corresponding increase of the anatomical deviations described in the slighter cases. The sinking in of the right loin increases, and the transverse processes of the lumbar verte- briE are at too great a depth to be felt; whilst on tile left side, the prominence of the spinal muscles, and the general enlargement, increases; the trans- verse processes on the left side (that of the con- vexity) can often be distinctly felt, as they some- times rise to the level of the apices of the spinous processes. The prominence of the right hip in- creases from the sinking in of the loin, and be- comes conspicuous, but as the lumbar curve is very siiort, these deviations are not externally very con- spicuous. When the form and situation of the spinal cur- vature vary from those just described, the external characters are modified accordingly, but it will be unnecessary to enumerate in detail all such de- viations. MORBID ANATOMY OP LATERAL CURVATURE, The normal curvatures of the spinal column in the antero-posterior direction have been already shown to depend upon the relative thicknesses of tlie intervertebral cartilages and the bones in the different regions of the spine; and there can be no doubt tliat tlie abnormal curvatures in the lateral or other directions, when not connected with dis- ease, also depend upon alterations in tiie relative thickness of the intervertebral cartilages and the bodies of the vertebrae at parts corresponding to the curvatures ; but in the abnormal conditions, these deviations are also associated with changes of direction in the articular facets of the oblique articulating processes. How these changes are brought about, it will be for us to inquire; but such structural changes must exist in every case of lateral curvature of the spine, however slight, and the existence of lateral curvature of the spine as a merely functional condition cannot be admitted. We must therefore consider what are the pre- cise deviations in direction assu)ued by the ver- tebrae, and the nature of the structural changes affecting the bodies of the vertebrffi, the interver- tebral cartilages, and the oblique articulating pro- cesses in the so-culled lateral curvature. GENERAL DIRECTION AND FORM ASSUMED BY THE SPINAL COLUMN IN THE SO-CALLED LATERAL CURVATURE. In the so-called lateral curvature the spinal column does not yield in a purely lateral direction, as a flexible column would bend, but presents the appearance of a spiral twist, owing to the bodies of the vertebra} turning round in a direction of hori- zontal rotation, so that their anterior surfaces are directed laterally along the convexity of the curva- ture. In a severe case this rotation commonly extends to a quarter of a circle in the centre of the curve, and diminishes from this point to the two extremities, so that the vertebra unequally turned upon themselves, cease to correspond in tiieir na- tural relations to each other, as well described by Bouvier, In a case of extreme severity, this rota- tion will Bometiraes extend even to half a circle, so that in the centre of the curve the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrce have a directly lateral aspect; in such cases the angles of the ribs project posteriorly, and are bent sharply upon themselves, extreme deformity of the chest of course resulting. This deviatiun of the bodies of the vertebra; does not necessarily correspond to, nor is it indicated by, any lateral deviation of the apices of the spinous processes. It may exist to a considerable exteiit —the rotation extending to a quarter of a circle in the centre of the curve—without any, or, at least, with very slight, lateral deviation of the apices of the spinous processes. A case in which this fact was demonstrated, together with a description of the appearances presented on the post-mortem examination, and the dissection of the specimen, accompanied by litho- graph plates, was published jointly by Dr. Hodgkin and myself in the " Transactions of the Medico- Chirurgical Society," vol. xxvii. 1854. After de- scribing the parts removed, I observed:—" The fact of the greatest practical importance which this specimen illustrates and clearly proves, is one which I believe has not hitherto been described, viz., that a very severe degree of lateral curvature of the spine, with transverse rotation of the bodies of the vertebrte, accompanied with lateral absorp- tion of the bones and intervertebral cartilages to a considerable extent, and attended with all the dis- tressing symptoms of the most aggravated form of this affection, may exist, with only a very slight lateral deviation of the apices of the spinous pro- cesses; in short, that the severest degree of de- formity of the spine may exist internally, without the usual indications in respect of the deviation of the spinous processes externally." If it be rare to find the extreme degree of internal curvature coexisting with an absence of external curvature, as in the case above described, it is undoubtedly true that internal curvature very frequently exists to a slight extent without any external curvature, or lateral deviation of the apices of the spinous processes, and the class of cases in which this condition will be found, is where a prominence or a growing out, as it is called, of one shoulder is said to exist without any spinal curvature. Such cases are frequently the cause of great anxietj' to parents, but are dismissed by surgeons with the comforting assurance lltut there is no curvatwe of the spine, whereas, the pro- minence of the shoulder, i.e. the posterior projec- tion of the scapula and the angles of the ribs, might most certainly be relied upon as indicating the existence of internal curvature, or lateral deviation of the bodies of the vertebrae. The pro- minence, or yroioiiig out of the shoulder, ought therefore to be regarded as indicating the existence of internal curvature of the spine, rather than an unimportant external appearance depending, as it is generally said, upon enlargement of the muscles caused b)'' excessive use of the right arm. A little consideration, and the examination of specimens preserved in museums, will satisfactorily prove that the spiral twist which the spine under- goes in lateral curvature, and which is due essen- tially to a horizontal rotation movement of the bodies of the vertebrae, mubt necessarily produce a posterior projection of the angles of the ribs, on the side of the convexity of the curve, in the dorsal region; and a posterior projection of the transverse processes on the side of the convexit.v of the curve, in the lumbar region, in a degree proportionate to the extent of deviation of the bodies of the verte- br;e; whilst in the concavity of the curve, tho

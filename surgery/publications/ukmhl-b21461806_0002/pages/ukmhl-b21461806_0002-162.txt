114 are sometimes formed within the synovial mem- brane, occasioning at times more or less pain in the joint, inflammation, and lameness. The dis- order, thougli not noticed by any of the very an- cient writers, is far from being uncommon. Pard is the first who speaks of it •. he says, that a liard, polished, ivhile body, of iU size of an atr mond, was discharged from the knee of a patient in the year 1558, in which he had made an mci- sion for an aqueous apostume, or hydrops articuli (Liv. XXV. chap. 16, p. 772.) A hundred and thirty-three years afterwards, viz. m IfaJl, Pechlin published the full details of another case, in which a cartilaginous body was successfully ex- tracted from the knee. (06s. Physico Med. obs. 38, p. 306.) Dr. A. Monro, in 1726, dissected the knee-joint of a woman who had been hung, and found in the articulation a cartilaginous body of the shape and size of a small bean. These were the only examples of the disease known until the year 1736, at which period Mr. Simpson cut out of the knee a similar substance, which he sup- posed at the time of the operation was only beneath the skin. (See Edinb. Med. Essays, vol. iv.) But of late years the disease has been noticed and described by almost every writer. FThey have been referred to under various names, such as loose bodies in joints, inter-articular cartilages, osseous concretions, articular mice, and loose cartilages in joints. Velpeau calls them movable cartilages; and Nelaton strongly objects to the term cartilage, and proposes that they should be named movable or floating bodies m joints. Muller also objects to the term cartilage, lor, although they resemble that substance m consis- tence, they are distinctly fibrous in structure.] It would appear that all the very movable arti- culations are subject to the occasional presence ot these bodies, although they are more "'"i^'O" |" some joints than in others. They are generally found in the knee, and produce symptoms that render them the object of surgery. 1 hey are rare in thearthrodial joints. Morgagni and B. Bell met with them in the ankle; Haller m the joint of the jaw; Hey and Solly in the elbow; and Laennec in the shoulder. {Andral, Anal. Paihol. t i. p.29.) They have also been noticed in the articulation between the head of the fibula and the ib a, and in that between the pisiform and cuneiform They present great varieties in regard to num- ber si Je,'rd sha'pe. Usually there is but m^ m a single oint, and almost always so ^^^«"/"|^; but several may be formed in the same joint, b i ].;. Home mentions an instance r^J'^^ . were three.

When very large, they do not cause so much trouble to the patient as the smaller kind. A soldier of the S6lh regiment had one nearly as big as the patella, which occasioned little uneasiness, being too large to insinuate itself into the moving parts of the joint. [In colour they are whitish, greyish, or ot a yel- lowish white, often of a pearly appearance, and bear a strong resemblance to cartilage. Iheir surface is perfectly smooth and even polished, and consist of either a single mass or of several lo- bules, connected together by dense gristly matter. Thev may be tough and striated, like the liga- mentous tissue, or hard,like bone; but in a majo- rity of cases they are distinctly fibro-cartilaginous. When very ancient, they have usually a bony nucleus at the centre. These bodies are invested by a reflection of the synovial membrane, beneath which they are developed, and to which they are originally attached by a slender pedicle, which is ultfmately ruptured by the friction of the articular surfaces between which they are situated. (See Gross, Path. Anat. ed. 3, p. 274.) In shape they are o^.!, lenticular, or round, but they present great varieties in this respect. In the knee they are usually compressed and wedge-shaped, some- times raisid on one side and hollowed on the other, and in some cases not ^nl'^e the patella; often- times angular with numerous facets. Their con- sirtence will vary a good deal, accord ng to their deSy and composition. They seldom remain fong al rest while the limb is in motion, and when they happen to be in situations where they are preLed S^on with force by the diiferent parts o the joint, they occasion a sudden attack of violent pain, and materially interfere with its mo ions.] Various opinions have been promulgated as to the origin and structure of loose bodies in joints and at one time the conjectures oftered of the r mode of formation were by no means of a reliable Character. Mr. Hunter believed that they on^n- ated from a deposit of coagulated blood pon the end of one of the bones, which ^^^^^^^'f^'^^J^^ mture of cartilage, and had afterwards been sepa- rated What knt a show of truth to this opinion " the discoveryof small projecting P^^ts, P e - rinturallv formed, as hard as cartilage, m joints wS bid been'violently strained, or otherwise Sred and where death had occurred at different per ds after the accident.

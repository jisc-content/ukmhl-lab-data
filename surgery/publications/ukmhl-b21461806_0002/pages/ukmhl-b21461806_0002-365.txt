Mi lilaire, t. iii. pp. 150^ 153^ When amputation has been practised, this author recommends the exhibition of bark, good wine, tonics, &c., in order to promote the good effects of the operation. (P. ]54.) In Larrey's memoir there are many cases re- corded in fiivour of what he endeavours to prove VIZ., that, in cases of mortification from external >njur,es,i{ i/.epatient's life be in danger, amputation ought to be perjormed, although the sloughing may yet be in a spreading state. It should be remarked, that the practice of am- putation, in cases of spreading mortification, has generally had some partisans for many years past • but the weight of authorities has unquestionably been against it, and few surgeons in this country have ventured to deviate from the advice of Sharp and ir-ott. It IS curious, however, that Mehee, a writer, xyho wrote for the express purpose of de- claring his disapprobation of the early performance of amputation in gunshot wounds, should have ad- mitted of only one case, in which the operation is proper namely, gangrene succeeding the uvund made b^ a cannon shot. Here he thinks, that an - putation ought to be performed on the first appear- ance of the gangrene, in order to prevent it from spreading up the hmb. (See 2^-aiti des P^^ dArmes a/eu. P.ris, 1799.) It appears tha aoout the year 1809, Mr. A. C. Hutchison pe- formed with success two amputations in cases of spreading gangrene from gunshot wounds. (See FrM Obs on Surgery, p. 72.) After the battle of Waterloo, I followed the same practice. My friend Mr. Lawrence has successfully am- Vi' ^ spreading^mo" violence. Ihe skin of the amputated limb was greenish and livid; but the cuficle not yet de w th a,r, and with a discoloured offensive sanies Its appearance was not quite natural, where the incsion took place ; it was ycllowi h and ana! sarcous.

Mr Porter recommends leaving large flaps both of' inte.u ment and muscle. He considers, that, in su 1 cases, no e:cpectation of union by Jhe fi s inten ion can be entertained.

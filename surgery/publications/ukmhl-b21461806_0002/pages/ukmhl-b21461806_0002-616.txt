SCROTUM, CANCER OF, such cases, too, are the best adopted to the use of friction as a discutient. Friction, indeed, has long been employed for this purpose; but of late years, it has been introduced to an extent, and with an effect, far beyond the experience of all former practice. As yet, it has been circumscribed to the practice of a few individuals, with whom it is said to have performed very great cures; and if, upon the test of more extensive experience, it is found to answer its present high character, I shall consider the use of repeated frictions to be one of the most valuable improvements which have been introduced into practice in modern times. The safety and simplicity of the practice recommend it strongly to favour, though I am afraid they are the very circumstances which retard its adoption by the public in general. I only regret that I do not feel myself entitled to give a decided opinion upon the subject from my own experience, though I have known some instances of successful cures; but the reports of success are so numerous and so well supported, that I am inclined to think very favourably of the practice. " There is no substance, interposed between the surface of the swelling and the hand of the person who administers the friction, excepting a little flour, to prevent the abrasion of the skin. The friction is applied regularly two or three hours every day, with great celerity, the hand being made to move to and fro one hundred and twenty times in a minute, and the course may require to be continued, without interruption, for some months." (See Russell on Scrofula.) Here I would again recommend to the notice of surgeons, the external use of iodine, as perhaps possessing more efficacy than simple friction. (See Iodine.) Scrofulous affections of the joints are elsewhere explained. (See Joints.) Bronchocele, Iodine, Lumbar Abscess, Lupus, and Verkbrw, are other articles, containing matter connected with the preceding observations.

This peculiar dis- order, which commences as a wart-like excrescence, is described by Mr. Pott, as always miiking its first attack on, and its first appearance in, the in- ferior part of the scrotum; where it produces a superficial, painful, ragged, ill-looking sore, with hard and rising edges. He never saw it in persons under the age of puberty. According to Mr. Earle's observations, it very rarelj' attacks persons under the age of thirty. Most of the cases, seen by him, were in individuals between the ages of thirtj'and forty. He has seen three instances in subjects be- tween twenty and thirty; but only one at or before the age of puberty. A single case is mentioned by Sir. J. Earle, which happened in a child under eight years of age. I have seen one case in a boy not more than sixteen. (Med. Chir. Trans, vol. xii. p. 299.) Sir Aslley Cooper has known the disease occur at various ages from twenty to eight}'. In no great length of time, the disease pervades the skin and membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it enlarges, hardens, and renders truly and thoroughly distempered; Irom whence it makes its way up the spermatic chord into the abdomen, where it affects some of the viscera, or glands, and then soon becomes painliilly destruc- tive. (Poll.) Not only is the discharge from the sore very fetid, but the perspiration from the whole body has a peculiar and an aminoniacal smell, (/^'a/'/e, in ;l/c(if. Chir. Trans, vol, xii. p. 298.)

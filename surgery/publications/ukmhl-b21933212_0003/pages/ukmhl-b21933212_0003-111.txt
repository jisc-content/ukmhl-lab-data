DISLOCATIONS OF THE FOOT 77 The metatarsal boties may be dislocated from the tarsus either individually or as a whole. This accident is usually the result of extreme violence, and is generally accompanied by other injuries. Reduction is effected under antesthesia by making traction upon the front part of the foot and applying pressure over the prominent bases of the metatarsal bones. Dislocation at the metatayso-phalaiigeal joints also occurs. These injuries are very like the corresponding dislocations occurring in the hand (see p. 48), but they are of much greater rarity ; the treatment is exactly similar.

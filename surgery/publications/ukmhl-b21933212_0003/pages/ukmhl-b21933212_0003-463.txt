TUMOURS OF THE BRAIN 429 centimetres behind the bregma, the shorter hinb will indicate sufficiently accurately the direction of the fissure. The shorter Hmb is graduated so that the length of the fissure can be marked off on the scalp. Should this instrument not be available, an easy means of replacing it has been DQv\N enOS LONDON Fig. 182.—^Horsley's ' Rolandometer.' The graduated limb is set at an angle nf 67° to the other, which is placed along the vertical line of the skull from the root of the nose to the external occipital protuberance. The point of jvmction of the two limbs is applied five centimetres behind the centre of this line, so that the graduated limb slopes downwards and forwards ; it then lies over the fissure of Rolando. suggested by Professor Chiene. Take a square piece of paper and fold it diagonally so as to make a triangle, whose lesser angles are 45°. One side of this triangle is then folded back on to the base, so that its angle is reduced to 22^-". This folded-down portion is cut away, and the remainder a. /' a 6 a b Fig. 183.—Chiene's method or locating the Fissure of Rolando. The method is fully described in the te.xt; for the sake of clearness in drawing, a parallelogram is used here instead of a square. The side dc is first made to coincide with the side dh. Then the side dc is folded back along the line dc. This folded-back piece is cut away, and when the paper is then unfolded it has the shapp of the right-hand diagram. of the paper is unfolded and forms a trapezimn, one of whose angles is 45° + 22i° = 67F (see Fig. 183). The paper is placed with one side of this angle along the middle line of the skull, and its apex five centimetres behind the middle of this line—that is to say, it is applied over the upper

COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN 375 skull should be rapidly cut away with Hoffman's forceps in a down- ward direction along the course of the vessel. If the bleeding is free, it may be temporarily arrested by thrusting the finger between the dura mater and the bone in the direction from which the blood comes, while the skull is being cut away with the forceps. Except in cases in which the vessel is torn low down, it can generally be easily reached by the removal of sufficient bone. It is, however, often extremely difficult to apply a ligature to the vessel as it lies on the dura mater in the depth of the wound, and the best plan then is to under-run the vessel on each side of Fig. 156.â€”^The Relations of the Middle Meningeal Artery to the Sutures OF THE Skull. A, Posterior branch of the middle meningeal; C, anterior branch ; D, anterior interior angle of the parietal bone; B, posterior inferior angle of the parietal. {From a preparation by Prof. Arthur Robinson, formerly of King's College.) the tear by a fully-curved Hagedorn needle threaded with fine catgut (see Fig. 157). Gushing (see Trans. Amev. Surg. Assoc. (1911), Vol. xxix. p. 406,) has introduced ingenious silver clips or small staples which are ]5inched on to the vessel above and below the opening in it, and are left in situ (see Fig. 159). When the vessel is injured at a point where it is not quite free from the groove in the bone, it can usually be easily detached with a probe or, if necessary, more bone may be removed. In some cases, instead of a groove, a bony canal may extend upwards for some distance from the foramen spinosum, and it may then be necessary to chip the bone away gradually until the bleeding point is exposed. This should be done with

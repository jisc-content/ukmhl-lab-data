TRIGEMINAT. NEURALGIA 475 nerve fibres, and produces ancTesthesia. The needle is inserted at the outer border of the orbit and then passed backwards along the outer wall of the orbit, until it is felt to be in the sphenoidal fissures. The peripheral branches of the nerves are easily injected by inserting the needle through the foramina in the facial bones. 2. Neurectomy of the various branches.—Any of tlie three primar\' branches ina\ be resected.

The direction in which the needle (graduated in centimetres to allow the depth to be ascertained) is passed is evident from the figure. parts purified, either with the ordinary lotions or witli tincture of iodine. During the preliminary purification and the subsequent stages of the operation it is of great importance to prevent the access of strong anti- septic lotions to the conjunctiva. The position of the supra-orbital notch, whicli can usually be felt, is defined ; it is situated near the junction of the middle and inner thirds of the superior orbital margin. The supra-orbital artery lies close to the outer side of the nerve. An inci- sion three-quarters of an inch in length is made along the upper margin of the orbit, with its centre over the notch, the eyelid being drawn down and the parts steadied as the incision is made. The fi.bres of the orbicularis palpebrarum are exposed and separated, and the nerve is then seen

282 AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE somewhat higher up, the spinal cord itself may be adherent along the median vertical line of the tumour behind, and the nerves Ue on the inner surface of the sac waU as they proceed to the inter-vertebral foramina, or they may pass directly across the cavity. 4. Syringo-myelocele.—This is a rare condition in which the central canal of the cord is dilated, and a portion of the spinal cord is spread out over the interior of the sac. 5. Myelocele.—Not only is the bony framework deficient, but the skin Fig.—110.—Meningo-myelocele. A sacral spina bifida dissected. The continuation of the dura mater (a) and arachnoid (b) entering into the formation of the walls of the sac {d) are displayed. The spinal cord passes directly backwards from the upper part of the sac and is continued down its posterior surface [e). In its course, the nerves (/) are given off in a double vertical series. The nerves pass horizontally forwards from the back of the sac. The anterior and posterior roots are distinct; the ganglia on the posterior roots (c) occupy the usual position. {Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) Fig. III. — Myelo. CELE. The central canal of the cord is dilated and the soft parts over it are defective. {Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) also is undeveloped and tliere is a communication between the interior of the spinal canal and the surface of the body. This leads to a free discharge of cerebro-spinal fluid, and the death of the infant in a very few days. From the point of view of treatment the following clinical characters are important:—• (a) The size of the tumour, which may range from a small rounded swelling the size of a walnut to a large ovoid sac occupying the area of several vertebrae.

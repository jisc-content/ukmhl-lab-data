AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE 536 required (see Fig. 261). This operation only succeeds in closing a portion of the cleft, a small triangular gap being invariably left anteriorly ; this can be closed later. The soft palate may be united at the same time should the surgeon desire it, but it is, perhaps, preferable to postpone that to a later occasion. In this operation there is comparativel}^ little haemorrhage, there is no loss of soft parts, no tension after the operation, and no likehhood Fig. 261.—Lane's Needles and Needle-holder for Cleft-Palate Operations. of the flap sloughing, as the pressure of the tongue, which in the ordinary operation is so likely to cause separation of the flaps, is here Fig. 262.—Lane's Operation for Cleft Palate. A shows the method of cutting the large fJap abc. The muco-periosteum is then raised from the hard palate from dtoe for the reception of the edge of the flap abc. In B, this flap is turned across the cleft with its edge fastened between de and the bone. C and D show the method in horizontal section; ac is the flap the edge of which is fastened between the muco-periosteum (b) and the hard palate. E and F show the method of cutting a bevel (db) from the posterior or upper surface of the soft palate on one side to join to the reflected flap consisting of half the thickness of the soft palate on the opposite side {ac). actuall3^ beneficial and presses them together. As the bridge of union thus formed consists of a double flap, it is more likely to unite, and

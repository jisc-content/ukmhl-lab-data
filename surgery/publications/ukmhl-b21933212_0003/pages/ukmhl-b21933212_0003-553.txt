HARE-LIP 519 obliterate this small protuberance completely, it can be cut away at a later period. Afley-trcatment.—The horse-hair and catgut sutures may be taken out in two or three days, the deeper silkworm-gut stitches being left in for a week. The child should be fed at first with a spoon, great care being taken to prevent injury to the line of incision ; the point of the spoon A B C Fic. ^4^.—Modified Mirault's Operation. The ends of the flaps shown in B are pared away, after the edges of the cleft have been united, so as merely to leave the slight prnjection shown in C. should be introduced on the normal side of the lip. After the wound has healed, the child may be fed with the bottle. When there is a small V-shaped notch left at the free margin of the lip, it may be remedied by making an incision on each side at the junction of the mucous membrane and the skin below ; these incisions are carried .i B Fig. 244.—Nelaton's Operation. A shows the method of cutting the small flaps which are turned down and pared into shape so as to give rise to the slight projection seen in B. upwards till they meet above the apex of the notch, from which a short vertical incision is made downwards to the point of junction of the flaps. The lower ends of the incisions should not divide the mucous membrane. Two flaps are thus formed and are turned downwards. The refreshed edges of the notch are united by sutures and the flaps adjusted so as to restore the free border of the hp, any excess of mucous membrane being cut away. The operation is very similar to that described above for complete hare-lip.

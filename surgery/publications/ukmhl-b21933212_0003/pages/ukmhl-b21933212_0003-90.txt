56 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS limb. As the full flexion of the thigh is carried out, the femur should be rotated somewhat inwards and slightly adducted ; by doing this the Y-ligament is relaxed, and the head of the bone is disentangled. When flexion has been carried to its fullest limit, downward pressure should be made upon the knee, so as to depress the head of the bone, and at the same time the limb should be strongly rotated outwards. Abduction is next carried out to its fullest limit (see Fig. 29), the result being that the head of the bone passes downwards behind the acetabulum, and then forwards to a point opposite the rent in the capsule. The limb is finally Fig. 29.—Reduction of a Dorsal Dislocation of the Hip by Bigelow's Method. Second Stage. The fully flexed limb is now abducted and rotated outwards to its utmost limit. circumducted outwards, and brought down parallel to its fellow (see Fig. 30) ; the head of the bone is thus made to enter the rent and slip into the acetabulum. The success of these manoeuvres depends upon the integrity of the Y-ligament, which forms a fixed point around which the head of the bone rotates. Reduction by Traction.—Should reduction by manipulation fail, either because the opening in the capsule is too small, or because the Y-ligament has been injured, attempts should be made to reduce the dislocation by traction. The patient should be anaesthetised and laid upon his back, while an assistant fixes the pelvis. The surgeon flexes the hip

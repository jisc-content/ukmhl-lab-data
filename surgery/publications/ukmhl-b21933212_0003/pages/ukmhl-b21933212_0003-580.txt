546 CHAPTER XLIII. THE AFFECTIONS OF THE AURICULAR AND PAROTID REGIONS. DEFORMITIES OF THE AURICLE. The chief congenital deformities of the auricle calling for a plastic operation are excessive size or undue prominence. // the auricle is unduly prominent, an attempt may be made to remedy this by removing a triangular portion of the skin and cartilage from the posterior surface of the pinna (see Fig. 267) ; the amount taken away will vary according to the degree of the deformity. When the wound thus made is stitched up, the ear should Ue back in its normal position. The cut edges of the cartilage ai-e united separately by catgut sutures. Excessive size of the auricle may be diminished by excising suitable portions of the whole thickness of the pinna, the vertical measurement being reduced by taking a wedge from the upper part with its apex near the external meatus, and the breadth by removing a strip of cartilage and skin from the middle portion (see Fig. 268). MALIGNANT DISEASE OF THE AURICLE. As long as the malignant growth is confined to the auricle there is no difficulty in the treatment, which consists in the removal of a sufficient portion of the auricle with some healthy tissue around the disease. In some cases, however, the malignant disease begins in the external auditory meatus or in the auricle in its immediate \acinity and spreads rapidly up the meatus ; the operation then becomes more difficult and unsatisfactory. The glands in the parotid region are affected early in these cases, and when they are involved, the chances of eradicating the disease by operation are very slight. Under these circumstances, the whole parotid gland should be removed without any regard to the preservation

70 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS- more or less longitudinally, in other cases it is di\-ided transversely. In some cases the main portion of the cartilage is torn from its connection with the tibia, but remains attached to the spine of the tibia at both ends. In others, one of the ends attached to the spine of the tibia is torn through and the free part curls up in the inter-condyloid notch and becomes nipped between the ends of the bone. The exact lesion of the cartilage, however, cannot be clearly made out until the joint is opened. Fig. 37.—Injxjries to the Semilunar Cartilages. The sketches show the usual types of injury to the semilunar cartilages. In A the anterior end is torn away from its attachment; in B the cartilage is torn nearly across about its middle ; in C the periphery is tern loose from the head of the tibia; in D there is a longitudinal rent in the cartilage. TREATMENT.—It is well to consider the treatment under two headings : cases that are seen immediately after the occurrence of the first injury; and cases in which the trouble is constantly recurring. In cases seen immediately after the injury, the first thing to do is to try to reduce the displaced cartilage. This can be accom- plished by flexing the joint completely in order to disengage the cartilage from between the condyles, and then, while keeping up pressure over the side of the articulation, suddenly extending the leg, at the same time rotating the foot inwards (if the internal cartilage has been damaged), or outwards (if it is the external which is at fault). This manipulation should be repeated several times until the joint moves smoothly, and there is no

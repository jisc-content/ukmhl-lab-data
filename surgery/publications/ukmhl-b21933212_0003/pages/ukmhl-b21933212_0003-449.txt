415 MENINGOCELE AND ENCEPHALOCELE a pure meningocele. The presence of much brain tissue contra-indicates an operation. The patient sliould be carefully examined for other con- genital defects or abnormalities, which may make it undesirable to operate, such as hydrocephalus, spina bifida, and paralysis of the limbs. If opera- tion is decided on, this should be carried out as soon as the condition of the child will i)ermit. In performing the operation, the skin is carefully disinfected and an elliptical portion is removed over the swelling, including any ulcerated or thin areas.

The pedicle is transfixed by a needle carrying a double catgut ligature, which is tied and the remainder of the sac is cut away ; the flaps are then carefully sutured. When the pedicle is large, it is better to tap the meningocele, allow some of the fluid to escape slowly, and cut away the sac, leaving sufficient tissue to permit the edges to be accurately approximated and to prevent the further escape of cerebro-spinal fluid. If a small quantity of brain tissue be present in the sac, it may be replaced or cut away, any bleeding points being ligatured, or the hjemorrhage arrested by sponge pressure.

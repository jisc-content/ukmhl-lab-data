LOOSE BODIES may be dislodged by tlie fluid and carried witliin reach. Should this fail, the opening in the capsule must be enlarged sufficiently to expose the interior of the joint and the loose body searclied for ; it will almost certainly come into view, especially if the knee be flexed and extended rapidly several times. After the loose body has been removed, the joint is flushed out with normal saline solution, the incision in the capsule accurately stitched up with line catgut, and the flap sutured in place. A drainage tube is unnecessary ; no splint need be used, and the patient may move the limb as soon as lie wishes to do so after the wound has healed.

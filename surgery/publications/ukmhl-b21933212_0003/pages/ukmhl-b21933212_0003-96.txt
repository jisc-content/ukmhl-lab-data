62 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS and the region of the neck and head of the bone is exposed (see Fig. 35). In order to obtain satisfactory access to the acetabulum, it will generally be found necessary to detach the tensor fasciae femoris and the anterior part of the gluteus minimus from the ilium, as they will be shortened, and will not only oppose retraction of the wound, but also interfere Fig. 35.â€”Incision for Exposure of the Neck of the Femur, a, Sartorius; b, Tensor fasciae femoris; c, capsule of the hip-joint; d. Quadriceps. with the extension of the limb necessary to bring the head of the bone into position. The capsule is incised near its insertion into the neck of the femur and the Y-ligament defined and divided at that spot. The capsule is then pulled aside so as to expose the acetabulum, out of which any soft tissues must be cleared in order that it may receive the head of the femur. Traction is then effected by an assistant or by pulleys, and any resisting structures are divided ; not infrequently the tendon of the obturator internus must be cut. The head of the bone can then usually be brought into the

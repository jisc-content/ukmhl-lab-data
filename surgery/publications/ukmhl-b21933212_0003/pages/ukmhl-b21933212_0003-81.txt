CHAPTER V. 47 DISLOCATIONS OF THE WRIST AND FINGERS. DISLOCATIONS OF THE WRIST. Dislocation of the carpus from the radio-ulnar arch is of rare occur- rence, and usually results from heavy falls or violent blows upon the outstretched palm, the hand being bent backwards and the wrist-joint over-extended. The displacement may be either forwards or backwards, the latter being the more common form. The condition is difficult to diagnose from Colles's fracture, with which it is often confounded; the points of diagnostic importance are the maintenance of the normal relative positions of the styloid processes and the absence of any dis- placement of the hand to the radial side in dislocation. TREATMENT.â€”This can be carried out without an anaesthetic. The dislocation is readily reduced by traction, which brings the articular surfaces into contact, and there is little tendency to recurrence of the deformity. It is well to lay the hand upon an anterior splint for a few days and to employ the ordinary evaporating lotions (see Vol. I. p. 9), as there is often considerable effusion into the joint and the tendon sheaths around it. Massage should be practised from the first. The splint may be left oft in a week and the arm kept in a sling for two or three weeks longer, whilst massage and passive movement are persevered with. The result is usually satisfactory. DISLOCATIONS OF THE CARPAL BONES. Dislocation of one carpal bone from another, is not nearly so rare as was at one time supposed ; it usually occurs in connection with crushes of the hand or run-over injuries. Some ' sprains ' of the wrist are examples of this injury, and it is always advisable in doubtful cases to obtain a stereoscopic radiogram of the joint. In most cases it is best to remove the displaced bone. We have had a considerable number of

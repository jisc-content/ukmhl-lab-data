12 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS his knee against the spine and, grasping one shoulder in each hand, puUs them forcibly backwards. This disengages the sternal end of the bone, which either slips into place or can be pushed forwards by the fingers. The best plan to prevent the deformity recurring is to brace the shoulders back with handkerchiefs, applied as for fractured clavicle (see Fig. 3, A). The elbow on the injured side should be supported and brought well forward over the chest (see Fig. 3, B). Unreduced Dislocation.â€”In long-standing cases, and in some recent ones in which the end of the bone is displaced backwards and presses on the trachea, and cannot be brought into place by manipulation, it may be necessary to remove the sternal end. This is exposed by means of a curved incision with its convexity upwards. The periosteum is incised parallel to the long axis of the bone, and stripped off both surfaces of the bone with a nigine. A Gigli's wire saw is then passed around the bone immedi- ately beneath the periosteum by means of a special introducer (see Fig. 18) and the sternal end is divided, after which it is seized with bone forceps and carefully removed, any structures retaining it being peeled off with a rugine assisted by a few touches of the point of the knife kept in close contact with the bone. Extreme care is required at this stage of the operation because adhesions may have occurred between the end of the bone and the innominate vein, but the risk of damage to the latter structure is comparatively slight if the periosteum be peeled off completely before the end of the bone is removed. The wound is sewn up without a drainage-tube, the shoulder is drawn back, and the arm is kept in a large elbow-sling until healing is complete, when the sling may be left off and the patient allowed to use the limb.

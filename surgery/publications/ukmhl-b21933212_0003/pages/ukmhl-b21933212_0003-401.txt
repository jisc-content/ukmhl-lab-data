CHAPTER XXXII INTRA-CRANIAL INJURIES. The effect of a severe injury to the head is not Hmited to the scalp ; the contents of the cranium may also suffer. These intra-cranial affec- tions vary acording to the force, the situation, and the nature of the injury, and also according to the presence or absence of fracture of the skull. The chief are: concussion, contusion, laceration and com- pression of the brain, and various inflammatory troubles, such as extra-dural, sub-dural or cerebral abscess, lepto-meningitis, and phlebitis and thrombosis of the sinuses. CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN. By concussion of the brain is meant a state of unconsciousness into which a patient falls immediately after a severe injury to the skull, and before intra-cranial hemorrhage has taken place to such an extent as to cause symptoms of compression. Concussion of the brain is prac- tically a condition of shock resulting from disturbance of the nerve centres. There has been much discussion as to what happens to the brain in concussion. At one time it was supposed that the functions of the brain are disordered without any actual lesion of its substance. It has, however, been found that, in patients who have died during the stage of concussion, there is always some haemorrhage into the substance of the brain, and in some cases distinct laceration of the cortex, and some hold that in all cases of concussion there is an actual lesion of the struc- ture of the brain. On the other hand, it seems reasonable to suppose that when force is applied to the head, the delicate brain and the cerebro-spinal fluid will be forcibly thrown into commotion and that, as the result of these violent oscillations of the brain substance, tem- porary disturbance (ending in more or less complete suspension of function of the brain cells) may result without there being necessarily any gross lesion.

492 AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE triangular raw surface at the outer end of the incision in the neck ; this can be covered at once by a skin-graft. The second plan is the following : Instead of continuing the V-shaped cut down on to the neck, an incision is carried straight outwards, or with A B Fig. 222.—Restoration of the Lower Lip by means of Curved Incisions. Here the lip is removed by a large V-shaped incision ace. The incision ac is prolonged to b, and cetod; these flaps are then dissected up and sutured as shown in B. The mucous membrane is sutured to the skin along the lines af and eg, and these form the margin of the new lip. If any raw surface is left at e, it can be closed by undermining the triangular flap of skin deb, or by a skin-graft. It is clear that there cannot here be the same direct drag upon the new lip by contraction of the cicatrices as there is in the preceding figure. a slight convexity upwards, from the angle of the mouth on each side as far as the masseter muscles, dividing the whole thickness of the cheek up to that point. When the incision reaches the masseter, it is curved A B Fig. 223.—Restoration of the Lower Lip bv Incisions over the Masseters. The free margin of the new lip is formed by stitching the mucous membrane to the skin along the horizontal part of the incisions, A ; ae and ce are approximated in the middle line and form a vertical scar, as shown in B. outwards and downwards over the margin of the jaw, and then under the latter nearly to the hyoid bone, ending with a shght upward curve in front (see Fig. 223, A). The flaps thus marked out are raised from the margin of the masseter and the lower jaw, the mucous membrane being divided vertically downwards along the anterior border of the masseter,

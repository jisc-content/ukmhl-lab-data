DIVISION I. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. SECTION I.-^INJURIES OF JOINTS. CHAPTER I. DISLOCATIONS : GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. DEFINITION.—In a dislocation tliere is partial or complete dis- placement of the ends of the bones which constitute the joint, so that the articular surfaces no longer maintain their relative positions. In a complete dislocation the normal positions of the articular surfaces are altered so that the end of one bone overrides the other ; this is most common in the baU-and-socket joints, but it may occur in almost any joint in the body. In a partial dislocation, on the other hand, there is only an incomplete displacement—usually lateral—without any overriding; this is most common in hinge-joints—such as the elbow or the knee. CLASSIFICATION.—Dislocations may be classified, according to their cause, into the three following groups :— Traumatic dislocations, in which a healthy joint is dislocated as the result of violence. Under this heading will also come recurring dis- locations, which are commonest in the shoulder and thumb. They are due to extensive injury to the capsule of the joint, followed by imperfect repair, and also, in the case of the shoulder-joint, to an imperfectly formed head of the humerus which does not fit the glenoid cavity. Pathological dislocations, or those resulting from disease. The chief factor in the production of this form is disease in the joint capsule and ligaments, which give way and allow displacement of the ends of the III. B

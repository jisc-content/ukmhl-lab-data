i6 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS is freely open, while at the same time the head of the bone comes down almost to its normal position (see Fig. lo). The last step in the manipula- tions is to rotate the arm inwards, and carry the elbow forwards across the front of the chest, making the fingers touch the opposite shoulder (see Fig. 7). This brings the head of the bone back through the rent in the capsule (see Fig 11) ; and at this point it generally slips into position almost imperceptibly. The arm is finally brought down to Fig. 5.â€”Kocher's Method of Reducing Dislocations of the Shoulder. Second Stage. The forearm is rotated outwards as far as it will go while the elbow is kept at a right angle and firmly pressed to the side. the side (see Fig. 8) to which it is fastened after being supported in a large elbow-sling. Although these manipulations have been described in stages for the sake of clearness, the process is continuous in practice and shordd be carried out rapidly and forcibly. In some cases the re-position of the bone is not noticeable, and it is not until after the manipulation has been completed that an examina- tion of the shoulder shows that it has been successful ; in other cases there is a distinct jerk when it sUps in. There should be no difficulty in ascertaining whether the dislocation has been reduced. The

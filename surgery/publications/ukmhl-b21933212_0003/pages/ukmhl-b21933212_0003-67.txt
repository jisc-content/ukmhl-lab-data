33 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER wool should be placed over the front of the head of the humerus so as to resist any tendency to displacement forwards. Passive movements should be begun in a week ; for the lirst few days an anaesthetic is generally necessary. The elbow is grasped in one hand and the shoulder-joint carried out without removing the dressing. They should be con- tinued daily for three weeks, and then twice a day. Passive move- ment is most important, as there is a constant tendency to the formation of adliesions, which, if unchecked, might entirely neu- tralise the results obtained by the operation. Excision of the liead of the bone should only be performed when an examination of the condition of the parts through the incision re- commended above, convinces the surgeon that it is impossible to get the head of the bone into position. It is readily done after the detach- ment of the soft tissues described above (see p. 31), the bone being divided with a saw or a chisel, and the soft parts on the opposite side protected by a broad copper spatula ; a Gigli's saw passed in the other, and the movements B Fig. :8.â€”Gigli's Saw and Stiles's Introducer. The saw, /4, is a finely tempered wire witli a low screw-tliread cut on it. It is introduced by iioolting it into ttie eye of tlie introducer, B, whicli is passed round tlie bone like an aneurysm needle and then withdrawn carrying the saw. The handles are then hooked on to the saw which can then be made to divide the bone very rapidly. round the head of the bone by a special introducer (see Fig. 16) answers very well. A considerable amount of the bone must be taken away if a good result is to be looked for ; unless this is done, the movements will be imperfect, as the long axis of the humerus will be in a wrong position. It will generally be advisable to cover over the divided end of the bone with a flap of soft tissues, as recommended by Murphy, III. D

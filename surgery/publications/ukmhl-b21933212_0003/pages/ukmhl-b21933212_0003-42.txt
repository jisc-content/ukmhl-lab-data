CHAPTER 11. 8 DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. Either end of the clavicle may be dislocated ; the acromial is the one more frequently affected. DISLOCATION OF THE ACROMIAL END. This is really a dislocation of the scapula from the clavicle, and, although more frequent than dislocation of the sternal end, it is far from common. It is usually caused by falls or blows upon the back or outer side of the shoulder, which push the scapula forwards. Falls or blows upon the point of the shoulder generally produce fracture. DISPLACEMENT.—The acromial end of the clavicle almost invariably projects above the acromion process of the scapula, which is displaced forwards and downwards ; there is generally dropping of the shoulder. Cases have, however, been met with in which the clavicle was displaced below the acromion ; it has even been found below the coracoid process. TREATMENT. — Of Dislocation upwards. — Reduction is effected easily by carrying the shoulder forcibly backv\'ards and upwards, pushing up the elbow and pressing down the acromial end of the clavicle. This brings the articular surfaces into good position, but the difficulty is to maintain the reduction. Some deformity is certain to recur, and will be permanent. Fortunately, however, it rarely interferes with the usefulness of the limb, and heavy manual labour can often be performed as well as ever in spite of considerable deformity ; occasionally, however, the patient's work may be much interfered with. Splints.—However well the arm be fixed immediately after the dislocation has been reduced, there is a constant tendency for it to drop, when the end of the clavicle immediately projects upwards. This is practically unavoidable, but when it is important to reduce the resulting deformity to a minimum, the best plan is to support the arm in a large

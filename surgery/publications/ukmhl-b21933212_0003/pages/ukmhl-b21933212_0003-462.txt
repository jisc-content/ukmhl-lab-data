AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD 428 (see Fig. 182), which is made of flexible metal so that it is easily sterilised and adjusted to the surface of the skull. When the long limb is placed Fig. i8r.—Reid's Method of Cerebral Localisation. AB is Reid's base-line, and runs from the lower margin of the orbit backwards through the centre of the external auditory meatus. From this, two lines are drawn upwards at right angles: one, CD, from the depression just in front of the ear to the middle line of the skull (from the glabella to the external occipital protuberance), and the other, EF, from the posterior border of the mastoid process to the same line. The line GK indicates the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius, and runs from a point li inch directly behind the external angular process of the frontal, to another point J inch below the parietal eminence (•). The point K, at which this line meets the middle line of the skull, localises fairly accurately the mesial end of the parieto-occipital sulcus. The fissure of Rolando corresponds mainly to a line drawn from F to H, the point of intersection of the fissure of Sylvius with the vertical line CD. The bifurcation of the Sylvian fissure lies about J inch behind G on the line GK, and the vertical limb runs upwards from that point for about i inch. L, Lambdoid suture; P.O., parieto-occipital fissure; S, fissure of Sylvius ; R, fissure of Rolando ; Sq., squamous suture ; C, coronal suture; *, parietal eminence. The drawing is from the same preparation as that used for Fig. 179. over the antero-posterior line of the skull with the smaller angle (67°) looking forward, and the point of junction of the two limbs about five

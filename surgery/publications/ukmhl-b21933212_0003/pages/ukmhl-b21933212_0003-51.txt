Moreover the hand can be brought to the opposite shoulder, and a ruler laid flat upon the outer aspect of the arm can no longer be made to touch both the external condyle and the acromion as it did when dislocation was present. Traction Methods.—In muscular subjects without an anaesthetic Fig. 6.—Kocher's Method of Reducing Dislocations of the Shoulder. Third Slage. Wliilc full outward rotation is maintained, the arm is carried upwards parallel to the antero-posterior plane of the body until it is almost horizontal. Kocher's method is not always successful; should it fail, some form of traction must be resorted to.

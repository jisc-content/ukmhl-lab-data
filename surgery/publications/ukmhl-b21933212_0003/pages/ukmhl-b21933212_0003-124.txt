90 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS forearm and midwaj' between pronation and supination ; the shoulder should be abducted ; the wrist should be thrown backwards and the thumb allowed to hang down ; the hip should be shghtly abducted and fully extended ; the ankle should be fixed so that the foot is at right angles to the leg. As the discharge diminishes, the drainage tubes should be gradually shortened until finally they are removed. It is well to leave those that drain the most dependent parts of the joint to the last; for example, in the knee the lateral tubes should be shortened so that they only project from the lateral aspect of the Hmb and no longer emerge through the Fig. 46.â€”Anterior Suspension Bar for Wounds of Joints. The figure shows the splint applied for a wound of the knee-joint. The metal bar is secured to the limb by plaster of Paris bandages above and below the joint, which is left free for the application of dressings. The apparatus is slung from a cradle by the two hooks shown above, or by slings of bandage. It is a very useful form of splint, as it can be extemporised easily. anterior opening, while those that pass across the joint may be cut in two so that there is a tube on each side, and these should be gradually shortened. Care must be taken that the drainage tubes do not slip into the articular cavity ; they may be secured by safety pins passed through their free ends. Gentle passive movement should be attempted as soon as the wound has become superficial, but great care must be taken, because recrudescence of the inflammation may be brought about by rough usage. The movements should not be carried so far as to cause pain to the patient, but they should be steadily increased in range. So long as some amount of movement remains and no increase of inflam- mation is produced by the passive motion, this should be persevered with for months if necessary, in the hope of obtaining a useful joint.

243 R 2 CHAPTER XXIII. DISEASES OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. INFLAMMATION OF THE BURSA BENEATH THE BICEPS TENDON. Inflammation of the bursa between the tendon of the biceps and the tubercle of the radius sometimes occurs; but as the bursa Hes deeply and seldom gives rise to any noticeable swelling, even though markedly distended, the diagnosis is often difficult. When the bursa is much distended it is apt to be mistaken for a solid tumour. A characteristic point in the diagnosis is the occurrence of pain when the elbow is flexed with the forearm fully supinated, whereas there is little pain if the limb is in the pronated position. This arises from the fact that in the former case the biceps alone is called into play, whilst in the latter the brachialis anticus is the most important agent. There is also special tenderness on pressure just over the bicipital tuberosity, and the pain is increased by rolling the biceps tendon laterally over the bursa, and by alternate pronation and supination. TREjATMENT.—The treatment consists in rest on a rectangular splint which throws the biceps out of action. After a short time moderate elastic compression and massage should be employed ; in persistent cases it may be necessary to open and drain the bursa. ACUTE SUPPURATION. This affection usually occurs after septic penetrating wounds of the joint, and is soon followed by disorganisation of the articulation witli all its accompanying risks. TREATMEjNT.—The joint should l)e opened freely by incisions on the inner and outer sides, draining both the front and back of the joint (see Fig. 50). This may be followed by continuous irrigation if tlie case is severe (see p. 88).

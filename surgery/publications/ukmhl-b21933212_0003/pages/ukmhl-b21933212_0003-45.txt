II DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE nature depends to some extent on the direction in which the shoulder is carried by the injury. If this be pushed forwards, the sternal end may be displaced backwards, if backwards the sternal end wiU be displaced forwards, while, if it be depressed, the sternal end will be displaced upwards. When the sternal end is displaced directly upwards, the rhomboid ligament is torn as well as those of the joint proper. As a result of these dislocations there is considerable interference with A B Fig. 3.—Apparatus for Dislocation' of the Sternal End of the Clavicle. The shoulders are first drawn well back by the handkerchiefs braced together, as shown in A. Then the forearm is flexed across the chest and the elbow supported by the oblique band of strapping seen in B. the movement of the upper extremity, and when there is backward displacement severe dyspnoea or even dysphagia from pressure upon the trachea or oesophagus may be present. TREATMENT.—It is often very difficult to keep the ends of the bones in position after reduction. It is generally best to carry the shoulder backwards and outwards under an anaesthetic, when the sternal end of the bone can usually be replaced. When dyspnoea is present, an anaes- thetic must be avoided ; the patient should sit upon a chair while the surgeon, standing behind him with the foot upon the same chair, places

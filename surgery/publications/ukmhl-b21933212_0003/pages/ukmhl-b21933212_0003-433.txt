SUPPURATION FROM MIDDLE-EAR DISEASE 399 Treatment of Sinus Thrombosis.—When the lateral sinus is throm- bosed, it is important to determine whether the thrombus is infected or not. In the earl}?- stages this is not always easy, but to some extent the general symptoms are a guide. The presence of rigors, an intermittent temperature, and other signs of pyaemia, are of great help ; additional information is gained by ascertaining whether the clot in the sinus is firm and dark or whether it is softening and yellowish. When the clot is firm and dark, infection is probably absent or only in its initial stages, and the prognosis is comparatively good. When the clot is breaking down, the patient is in imminent danger of death from Fin. 168.—Exposure of the Lateral Sinus after the complete Mastoid OPERATION. The post-aural incision has been prolonged backwards and the groove of the lateral sinus—in which is seen an extra-dural abscess—has been exposed. pj'aemia. In some cases the wall of the vein may have sloughed, so that the contents simply form part of a sub-dural abscess ; and when this is so, the symptoms are characteristic of a breaking-down thrombus. Washing out the pus, with free exposure and drainage of the sub-dural space, may suffice for a cure under these circumstances. In all cases, however, in which there is thrombosis of the sinus, it is best to cut off the main communication between the sinus and the general cir- culation before dealing farther with the local condition. The wound is covered up with sterile cloths ; fresh sterilised instruments, towels, and rubber gloves are taken, and the internal jugular vein is exposed in the neck well below the limit of the clot, ligatured in two places, and divided between the ligatures.

414 CHAPTER XXXV. MENINGOCELE AND ENCEPHALOCELE : MICROCEPHALUS : HYDROCEPHALUS. MENINGOCELE AND ENCEPHALOCELE. These congenital deformities are not uncommon. The protrusion may consist of the meninges alone, and contain cerebro-spinal fluid—meningo- cele—or it may contain brain substance as well, encephalocele. Its most frequent situations are the middle line of the skull, the occipital region, and the root of the nose. The diagnosis is usually comparatively easy. The swelling may vary in size with respiration, and, when brain substance is present, there is also marked cerebral pulsation. It is generally partially reducible, but attempts at reduction frequently give rise to signs of irritation of the brain. The opening in the skull can often be felt; it may be quite small or it may be very extensive. The prognosis is usually unfavourable. The tumour may vary in size from quite a small swelling to one involving the greater part of the cranial contents. The latter cases are especially unfavourable, and the children seldom survive more than a few days or weeks. TREATMENT.—In large tumours and those containing much brain substance, palliative treatment with the view of avoiding ulceration and spontaneous rupture of the sac is best; this consists in protecting the tumour with a suitable shield, as described in connection with spina bifida (see p. 284), and in the use of antiseptic lotions or ointments when the skin is abraded. Many forms of radical treatment have been attempted, but much depends on the size of the tumour, the size of the defect in the skull and the nature of the contents of tlie tumour. For very smaU tumours it may not be necessary to operate at all. A large tumour, which has a small pedicle, may be successfully dealt with, especially if it is

2l6 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS turned backwards and the capsule exposed. After the bleeding has been arrested the capsule is incised, and the opening held apart so as to expose the interior of the joint, the knee being flexed sufficiently for this purpose. The synovial membrane is then examined to see if any villous outgrowths are present, and the finger is passed into the recesses of the joint, particularly above the patella, to search for any loose body. Finally, the ligamenta alaria are examined ; should they be loose, the free ends will probably be thickened from the constant irritation, and they should be cut off close to the fatty pad and removed. The wound is then closed in the usual manner [vide supra) ; no splint is necessary. The after-treatment is the same as in the preceding cases. The patient does perfectly well without one or both of these ligaments. INJURY TO THE SEMILUNAR CARTILAGES. This is the commonest form of internal derangement of the knee-joint. One or both cartilages may be injured, the one usually affected being the internal. The accident follows some sudden strain, more especially rotation at the knee-joint, the internal semilunar cartilage being damaged by violent external rotation of the leg, whilst the external is injured by violent internal rotation. The accident most commonly occurs whilst playing football or lawn-tennis, or doing anything in wMch the leg is planted firmly upon the ground and the body is twisted violently round upon it. This condition has been fully described on pp. 107 et seq.

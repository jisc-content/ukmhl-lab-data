TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA 487 pad is bandaged on. The stitches uniting the hds are removed on the fifth day, but for several weeks afterwards the greatest care must be taken to prevent irritation of the anaesthetic conjunctiva ; to this end tlie patient should use a boric eye-wash frequently and the eye should be covered with a shade. In spite of all precautions, how- ever, trophic ulceration of the cornea (neuro-paralytic keratitis) may supervene and the globe may have to be excised. The drainage tube should be removed at the end of forty-eight hours. The wound heals well and there is hardly any risk of injury to the brain subsequently, as the defect in the skull is quite low down.

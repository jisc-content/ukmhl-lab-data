AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE 526 just external to the edge of the cleft. By cutting steadily towards the apex of the cleft, a strip of mucous membrane, which should be of uniform thickness throughout, is detached from the entire edge. The strip is left attached at the apex, the knife is turned round and carried back, and the paring con- tinued to the tip of the uvula (see Fig. 252). A similar procedure is carried out on the opposite side, and then the strips are com- pletely separated by paring the V-shaped end of the cleft in front. It is important to pare each edge of the cleft in a single j)iece, so as to ensure that it is thoroughly done ; if taken away piece-meal, some part may be overlooked and left unpared, and al.so the thickness of the pared surface will be very variable. We consider that it is well to commence with the paring of the edges, although some Fig. 249.—Lane's Self-re- taining Gag. Fig. 250.—Forceps for Staphyloraphv.

This danger is, however, slight with a skilled B Fig. 251.—Staphylorapiiy Knives.

The bleeding at this stage is very slight and stops quickly.

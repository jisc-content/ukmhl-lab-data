AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD 420 of communication between the ventricles and the sub-dural space for any length of time. The results of these attempts clearly prove the truth of the views concerning the regulation of the cerebro-spinal fluid in the cranial cavit3^ and, in so far as the distension of the lateral ventricles is concerned, the operation described above has led to satisfactory results. Nevertheless in the congenital cases the children have usually died at the end of about Fig. 179.â€”Method of drainage employed for Internal Hydrocephalus. The drainage tube shown in Fig. 178 has been placed in such a position that one end projects into the greatly distended lateral ventricle, while the other lies beneath the dura mater. four months with symptoms such as retraction of the head and rigidity, indicating continued extension of the basal meningitis in spite of energetic anti-syphilitic treatment. It is to be feared that congenital hydrocephalus is not remediable unless checked at quite an early period ; even if the patients were to live, the brain is so badly developed and has been so injured by the pressure that no marked restoration of the cerebral functions could be expected. When, however, the brain has developed properly and the condition of internal hydrocephalus supervenes later, the outlook is more hopeful if proper drainage can be established and maintained. The essential

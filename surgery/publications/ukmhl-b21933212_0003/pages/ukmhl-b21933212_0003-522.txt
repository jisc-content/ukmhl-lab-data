CHAPTER XLI. THE PLASTIC. SURGERY OF THE FACE. When performing operations about the face, the surgeon often has to remove extensive portions of the skin or even of the whole thickness of the cheek, and very serious deformit}' will result if the gap thus made is not filled up. He may also be called upon to repair defects caused by the loss of tissue from disease or to remedy deformities of congenital origin—e.g., hare-lip. These defects may be recent or of long standing ; the latter may be either congenital or may follow an injury or a disease in which serious contraction has occurred during healing. The general principles of plastic surgery have been already discussed (see Vol. I. p. 157), but two points may be emphasised here. The first is that, when the loss of tissue has been produced by a surgical operation, it is better to perform the plastic operation then and there, rather than at a later period, provided that a sufficient blood-supply can be obtained for the flaps. The second is that when the loss of tissue has been the result of ulceration (especially when this has been syphilitic), care must be taken to see that the disease has become quiescent and cicatrisation is complete before undertaking any plastic operation ; failure to observe this precaution may lead to a recrudescence of the disease and sloughing of the flaps. PLASTIC OPERATIONS ON THE FACE IN GENERAL. The two chief methods of repairing defects on the face are by skin-grafting or by turning in flaps. Thiersch's Skin-grafting.—Immediate skin-grafting (see Vol. I. p. 53) is of great value where skin alone has been lost—as after the excision of lupus—and it should be employed in all cases in which flaps are not available and the loss of substance is not deep. Some degree of contraction may follow, but probably this will not be enough to cause any serious deformity ; even should deformity occur, it will, 4S8

The only special points in connection with wounds in this situation are the question of scarring, and the possibility of injury to important structures, especially the facial nerve and Stenson's duct. Wounds of the face heal with remarkable rapidity and are not very prone to septic complications. They are, however, liable to be attacked by erysipelas, which may spread to the scalp and lead to very serious complications, such as thrombosis of the diploic veins or the cerebral sinuses. TREATMENT.—x\part from the risk of infection common to all wounds accidentally inflicted, the chief point to be considered is the cosmetic result. Great care must therefore be taken to remove any dirt from the wound, lest suppuration and unsightly scarring result; it is important also to avoid stitch-marks as far as possible. Under certain circumstances, even more care must be taken in the primary cleansing of the wound than is necessary for the mere avoidance of sepsis. Wounds on the face are not uncommonly caused by falls upon metallic or other substances, which may be ground into the tissues and cause discoloration or tattooing of the parts. In some cases this is so marked that it may be necessary to excise the discoloured scar at a later period in order to get rid of the disfigurement.

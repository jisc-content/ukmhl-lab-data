235 CHAPTER XXII. DISEASES OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. SYNOVITIS with effusion, whether acute or chronic, is comparatively rare in the shoulder-joint, and the condition may be readily overlooked if the distension of the capsule is only slight. When it is considerable, the sweUing is most marked beneath the anterior edge of the deltoid, and the upper arm is slightly abducted and somewhat internally rotated ; fluctuation may sometimes be felt in the axilla. The treatment follows lines similar to those already described for acute and chronic synovitis (see Chap. XII.), and presents no points of special interest. It may be well, however, to draw attention to the stiff and painful shoulder-joints which not uncommonly follow injuries in elderly people. After a fall on the hand or shoulder in an elderly patient, it is very common to find that the joint becomes stiff. There is limitation of movements—especially of abduction—accompanied by severe pain. As a rule there is no evidence of effusion into the joint, and no creaking. The deltoid is often atrophied. An X-ray photograph generally shows no gross changes in the bones. The symptoms may begin immediately after the injury or some days later. The majority of patients are getting on in years. The affection is very intractable ; in some cases, permanent disability remains, others recover partially or completely, but only after a long course of treatment. The treatment consists in active and passive movements, massage, and hot-air baths. Injections of fibrolysin appear to be beneficial in some cases. ACUTE SUPPURATIOISr occurs as a result of penetrating wounds or as a complication of acute epiphysitis of the upper end of the humerus ; in the latter case the joint is often affected. The treatment is identical with that for similar affections elsewhere (see p. 94). The incisions for draining the joint will be found on p. 98.

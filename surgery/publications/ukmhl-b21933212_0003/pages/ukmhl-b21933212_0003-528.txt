AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE 494 wound sutured without compressing the nostrils and with little deformity. The same principle may be employed when the whole of the upper lip has been removed. In these cases it is well to make the operation wound as angular as possible, with its apex at the columella ; incisions are then A B Fig. 234.—Operation for Ectropion of the Lower Lip. The lip is liberated by the incision ab, and is then kept in place by raising flaps by means of the incisions cd and ce. These flaps are shown in position in B. carried from the columella round the alae, and up along the side of the nose on each side (see Fig. 226, A). The flaps thus marked out are raised, and a crescentic portion of the cheek is taken away on each side as in the former operation, large enough to allow the flaps to come together and form the upper lip. From the points (c) at which the incisions begin to curve A B Fig. 225.—Operation for Restoration of part of the Upper Lip. In A are shown the portions of skin (a and b) removed from each side of the cheek in order to allow the remains of the upper lip to slide inwards and meet in the middle line as in B. upwards around the alee, additional incisions are carried outwards into the cheek parallel to the line of the lip. The mucous membrane is now stitched to the skin on each side up to the apex of the V and these two surfaces are brought down to form the margin of the upper lip. At a point {d) on each side of the incision parallel to the lip, and at a distance

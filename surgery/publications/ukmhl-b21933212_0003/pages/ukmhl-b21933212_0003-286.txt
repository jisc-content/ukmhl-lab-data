252 CHAPTER XXIV. DISEASES OF THE WRIST AND HAND. DISEASES OF THE WRIST. ACUTE INFLAMMATION. The carpal and radio-carpal joints are comparatively seldom attacked by acute inflammation, but penetrating wounds may occur and lead to dangerous suppuration in the irregular synovial cavity, with all the severe general symptoms already described (see Chap. XT). Twists and sprains set up a subacute synovitis, sometimes associated with haemorrhage into the carpal articulations. The wrist-joint is a common seat of acute and gonococcal rheumatism. In acute and sub-acute inflammations of the wrist, the chief swelling is not so marked in the joint itself as in the tissues around it, and not uncommonly the tendon sheaths which lie over the dorsal surface become infected. TREATMENT.â€”In all cases of inflammation of the wrist-joint, the proper treatment is to fix the joint on a palmar splint arranged so as to throw the carpus and metacarpus backwards ; this splint is fully described on p. 255. In the acute stage the application of cold is of value. When the synovitis has followed a sprain, the fixation should not be continued for more than three or four days, otherwise adhesions may form in the joint and also in the tendon sheaths in its neighbourhood. The frequent association of a fracture with a sprain must not be forgotten, and persistent synovitis is often kept up by such a lesion (see Vol. II. P- 359)- Massage should be commenced about the third day, and in the intervals pressure should be applied either by an elastic bandage or by strapping (see p. 117). In all cases, whether the joint is fixed upon a splint or not, the fingers should be left free and constantly moved

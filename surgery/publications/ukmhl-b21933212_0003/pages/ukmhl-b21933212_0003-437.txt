SUPPURATION FROM MIDDLE-EAR DISEASE horizontally backwards through the skin, to cut away bone above and below the sinus (the limits of which are known by the colour of its con- tents) and then to puncture the dura mater above or below it, according as it is desired to explore the cerebrum or cerebellum (see Fig. 173). The method of exploring the brain is described below ; in practising it under these circumstances, great care luust be taken to prevent the in- troduction of septic material into the brain with the exploring instrument (see p.398 in reference to punctixre of the vein). The forceps are carried hori.zc>ntally forwards above the sinus to explore the temporo-sphenoidal Fig. 171.—Horsley's proportionately larger and the space smaller. 6, The opening Dura MATtR Separa- in the skull; a, the tentorium cerebelli. {Front a preparation TOR. by Prof. Arthur Robinson, formerly of King's College.) lobe, and forwards and inwards below that structure to explore the cerebellum. In other cases, however, the symptoms may point so clearly to an abscess of the brain, that the abscess may be sought for at once after clearing out the focus of disease in the ear. The following methods may be employed :— In operating for abscess in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, the best plan is to apply the pin of the trephine about an inch and a quarter above Reid's base line and directly above the ear. The dura mater, which bulges into the trephine opening and does not pulsate, is incised and the temporo-sphenoidal lobe exposed. In incising the dura, any large vessels running across it should be avoided if possible, or picked up in

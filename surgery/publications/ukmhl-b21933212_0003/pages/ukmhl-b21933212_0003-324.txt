290 AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE {b) Meningo-myelocele and Syringo-myelocele.—Should the skin be sound all over the tumour, excision, with isolation and return of the nerve elements, is best. In all cases in which operation is required on account of increase in the size of the tumour or a tendency to ulcera- tion over the sac, excision is the best procedure. When the tumour is ulcerating, excision is essential if it can be done ; if not, Morton's injections may be used. (c) Myelocele.—Here there is nothing to be done, except to purify the parts and apply antiseptic dressings.

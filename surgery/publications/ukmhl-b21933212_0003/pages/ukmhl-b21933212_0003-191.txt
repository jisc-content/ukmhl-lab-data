Simple synovitis of tlie hip-joint is not common, but it occasionally follows a sprain or twist. The sjanptoms are not very characteristic. The most marked are pain and difficulty in movement. It is most frequent in children, and is often very difficult to distinguish from early tuberculous disease. The distension of the capsule with fluid is not easily made out, owing to the depth of the jt)int from the surface, but on comparing the two giTtins some increased fullness can generally be demonstrated in front of the joint and also behind the trochanter on the injured side. The position assumed by the limb is one of slight abduction, flexion, and outward rotation. TREATMENT.—The chief essential in the treatment is rest, and for the iirst few days the patient should be kept in bed ; fomentations should be applied to the region of the joint if there is much pain. It is generally unnecessary to employ splints or any form of extension. If the pain is very severe, however, a Liston's splint may be put on for a few days. When the pain has passed off, passive and active movements and massage should be begun. The patient may be allowed to walk about in a week or ten days. When there is difficulty in excluding the possibility of early tuber- culous disease, it is well to put the patient to bed for three or four weeks ; should the affection be simple synovitis from a strain, it will be well by that time ; whereas, if it is commencing tuberculous disease, the condition

299 TUBERCULOUS DISEASE Fig. 117). This consists of a frame about an inch in width, shghtly smaller than the back of the trunk, crossing the body below at the level of the natal fold and extending up to the neck. Into this frame a suitably padded board is fixed, and this can be removed and replaced whenever it is necessary. The frame is fixed to the patient, either by a jacket which is attached to the inner edge of the outer frame or by webbing. The jacket is strapped and laced over the front of the patient, or if vyebbing is used, one piece should pass over each shoulder and two pieces should be carried round the trunk, all of these being fixed to the inner edge of the outer frame of the splint (see Fig. 121). The patient is thus firmly Fig. 1 M. â€”Cauvain's Spinal Carriage. (From a photograph by Mr. Gauvain.) attached to the splint; he can be turned over on his side, the back door taken out, and the back washed and powdered as often as is necessary. The back door is padded convexly, so as to provide hyper-extension. This splint may be suspended over the board, the weight of the head and the limbs producing additional hyper-extension (see Fig. 118). Figs. 119 and 120 show a simple and inexpensive carriage, designed by Mr. Gauvain, for transporting children in these splints about the house or into the open air. It can be arranged so that the child can read, play with his toys or take part in a school class. Figs. 121 and 122 show an excellent splint used by Mr. Gauvain which has adjustable leg splints.

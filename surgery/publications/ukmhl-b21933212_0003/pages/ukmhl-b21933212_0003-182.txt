148 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS excision gives an extremely bad functional result, and further osteophytic outgrowths are very apt to occur around the divided end of the bone, so that the operation is likely to result in an increase of the trouble. In the knee, on the other hand, excision may be justifiable when the pain is so great as to prevent the patient getting about, and when this joint is the only one affected. The bones unite readily and a stable limb is obtained. Excision of one knee may, however, be followed compara- tively rapidly by the appearance of the disease in the other knee, probably brought about to some extent by the increased strain tlirown upon the movable articulation by the stiff limb. At the same time, the risk of this is not sufficient to warrant our refusing to relieve the patient of his existing trouble by excision. In the elbow, operation gives a very fair result; and in the shoulder, excision often gives marked relief, although it seldom gives a perfectly useful joint. The excision in these cases need not be the prolonged proceeding that is necessary in tuberculous cases. There is no need to remove all the synovial membrane, and therefore the operation should not be accompanied by any shock.

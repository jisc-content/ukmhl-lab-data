During the course of syphilis various joint affectif)ns may be met with ; they occur during the secondary or the tertiary stage, and are also seen in hereditary syphilis. JOINT AFFECTIONS DURING THE SECONDARY STAGE. Two forms of joint affection are met with during the secondary stage. About the period when the earliest secondary symptoms manifest them- selves, it is not uncommon to find the patient complaining of indefinite pain and stiffness in a joint, unaccompanied by any marked tenderness on pressure, but generally associated with pains in the bones and muscles. There may be some effusion into the joint, with a certain amount of fever, and several joints may be affected. It is probable that the affection is simply a congestion of the synovial membrane and the other joint structures similar to the congestive eruptions on the skin. In the later stages of the secondary period, true synovitis with effusion is sometimes seen. This commences slowly and painlessly, and is accom- panied by slight stiffness followed by sweUing due to effusion, which though usually moderate in amount, may sometimes be considerable. The affection is most common in the knee, and may be bilateral. The effusion consists of a clear serous fluid, and there is no tendency to sup- puration, nor are there any signs of acute inflammation. A marked feature of this secondary syphilitic synovitis is its intermittent character ; at one time the joint may be much distended, whilst a few days later the fluid may have entirely disappeared ; then again, for no known reason, the fluid reappears. TREATMENT.â€”The general treatment is identical with that of secondary syphflis (see Vol. I. Chap. XL). As a rule no local treatment is required or at most an elastic bandage, or strapping with Scott's

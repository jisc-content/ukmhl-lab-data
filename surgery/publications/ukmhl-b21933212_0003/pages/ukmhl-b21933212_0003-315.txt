CHAPTER XXVI. SPINA BIFIDA. By the term ' spina bifida' is meant a congenital condition in which there is a cleft in the posterior wall of the spinal canal, due to imperfect development and want of union of the neural arches. This defect is usually accom- panied by a protrusion of the spinal membranes through the gap, and in some cases also of the nerves or the spinal cord itself. The cleft may affect one or several vertebrfe and is most common in the lumbar or lumbo-sacral region, although it may occur in almost any part of the spine. VARIETIES.—There are several varieties of this deformity. 1. Spina bifida occulta.—Here there is simply a defect in the laminae without any swelling or protrusion of the meninges ; the defect is often indicated by a distinct dimple of the skin. In association with this condition there is usually a tuft of hair on the skin over the defect. Although there is no protrusion, various paralytic con- ditions may be present—such as talipes, para- plegia, and want of control over the sphincters. 2. Meimigocele.—Here only the membranes of the cord project through the gap, and there are no nerve elements in the tumour. 3. Meningo-myelocele.—This is the most common variety, and in it there is protrusion both of the meninges and of various nerve elements. When the spina bifida occurs low down, the cauda equina may be spread out over and adherent to the interior of the sac. When Fig. 109.—Spina bifida.

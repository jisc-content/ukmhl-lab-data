CLEFT PALATE 527 Formation of the muco-periosteal flap alveolar border, these are formed by mal border of the hard palate on eacli ^ internal to the last molar tooth and running forwards parallel to the alveolar margin, until it reaches the level of the apex of the cleft on each side in front. This incision may be followed by fairly smart ha?morrhage from the posterior palatine artery or its branches. The pulsations of that vessel may sometimes be felt before- hand, and the incision can then be planned so as to avoid it; it should begin quite close to the last molar tooth. The knife must l)e held per- pendicularly to the plane of the mucous surface so as to avoid bevelling the edges of the flap. If the hemorrhage is severe, sponge pressure may be applied for a few moments, and then the detacliment of the muco-periosteal flaps from the bone should be proceeded with. This is effected by fine raspatories of varying curves (see Fig. 253) introduced through the lateral incisi used first, and the straighter ones ai )s.—If the cleft does not reach the ving an incision close to the alveolar dde of the cleft, commencing just Fig. 252.—Paring thil Clei t in Staphvlo- RAPHV.

Special curves may be required for the anterior portion. In detaching these flaps, care must be taken to avoid damaging them as they are often very tliin. The point of the raspatory should be inserted

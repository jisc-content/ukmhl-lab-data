377 COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN protuberance, with one running vertically upwards from the posterior margin of the mastoid process. The steps of the operation are similar to those just described. After the clot has been removed and the artery secured, the next questions that arise are, whether drainage shall be employed and whether Fig. 158.â€”Middle Meningeal H.3iMorrhage. The artery has been exposed by trephining and the opening enlarged in order to follow the vessel downwards. The case shows how localised pressure may be exerted over portions of the motor area. the portions of the skull shall be replaced. The answers depend essentially on the completeness with which the brain expands after removal of the clot. When the bleeding has quite ceased and the brain expands fuUy, so that the dura mater is again everywhere in contact with the bone, there is no need for drainage, and the bone removed may be replaced, either as one large circle or in several small pieces. When, however, the brain does not expand at once, a cavity is left between the dura mater and the

406 CHAPTER XXXIV. HERNIA CEREBRI: SINUS THROMBOSIS : TUBERCULOUS MENINGITIS. HERNIA CEREBRI. As a result of operations or injuries—frequently accompanied by inflam- matory processes in connection with the brain—there is not uncommonly a protrusion of cerebral substance through the aperture in the skull ; this is termed a hernia cerebri. This condition is quite different from encephalocele, in which the protrusion of the brain is due to a congenital abnormality and the scalp is intact. Clinicall}^ two types of hernia cerebri can be distinguished. The first of these is not connected with sepsis, and the brain which protrudes is healthy. In the second type the brain substance is unhealthy, and has been exposed to septic contamination which may or may not as yet have become established. CASES IN WHICH THE PROTRUDING BRAIN IS NOT THE SEAT OF AN ACUTE INFLAMMATORY PROCESS. This form of hernia cerebri occurs after operations of two different types, namely, those performed merely to relieve pressure on the brain and allow it to expand, and those performed for other purposes, in which no cause of increased intra-cranial pressure is at work. A hernia cerebri is deliberately produced when it is desired to relieve intra-cranial pressru'e—decompression operations. This is most commonly done when a patient is suffering from an irremovable growth inside the skull which causes severe pressure sj'mptoms, and in it a large area of the vault of the skull is removed in order to allow the brain to protrude. In these cases the scalp is stitched up and the hernia occurs beneath it, and nothing further is required beyond protection of the hernia against injury (see Fig. 174).

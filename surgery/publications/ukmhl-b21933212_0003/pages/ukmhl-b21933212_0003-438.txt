404 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD forceps as soon as the incision has been made. It is sufficient to make a sht in the dura mater just large enough to admit a pair of sinus forceps, and this need not be enlarged unless pus is found. The exploration of the brain is best effected with a pair of sinus forceps, introduced closed ; the blades are separated from time to time, when any pus they reach will escape between them. If the exploration is made with a hollow needle or with a trochar and cannula, the channel is apt to become blocked with brain substance and the pus may not escape, even though the instrument passes into an abscess cavity. The forceps should be pushed directly inwards in the first instance ; if they fail to reach pus, they may be directed upwards and backwards and finally downwards and forwards. In this way the three chief seats of temporo-sphenoidal abscess will be explored. If pus is found, the opening in the dura mater should be enlarged and a pair of dressing-forceps substituted for the sinus forceps. Some surgeons then introduce the nozzle of a fine syringe into the abscess cavitj^ and flush it out with a stream of warm saline solution. If this is done, care must be taken not to use the fluid under pressure, but to make provision for the free escape of the fluid, otherwise serious damage may be done. When the abscess cavity has been cleansed, the forceps may be withdrawn and the cavity allowed to close without drainage. In our

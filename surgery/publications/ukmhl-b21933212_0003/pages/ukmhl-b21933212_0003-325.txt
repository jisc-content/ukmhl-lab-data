291 u 2 CHAPTER XXVII. TUBERCULOUS DISEASE OF THE SPINE: TUBERCULOUS DISEASE OF THE SACRO-ILIAC JOINT. TUBERCULOUS DISEASE OF THE SPINE. The spinal column is the most common seat of tuberculous bone disease in children; 23 per cent, of all cases of tuberculous disease of bones and joints at that period of hfe occur in the spine. The majority commence before the age of ten. The favourite seat of the disease is in the dorsal vertebra, from the middle downwards ; then in the upper lumbar vertebrae, and less frequently in the upper cervical spine. The disease may affect either the body of the vertebra or one of its processes ; it is most common in the former situation, and when we speak of tuberculous spinal disease we mean disease of the body. In that situation it may commence either in the interior of the bone or on the surface, giving rise in the former case to soft deposits or sequestra ; in the latter to a tuberculous periostitis. Tuberculous Periostitis.â€”When the disease begins in the periosteum it spreads along the surface of the vertebra for a considerable dis- tance, causing more or less extensive superficial caries. As the disease extends from one vertebra to another, it spreads inwards along the inter- vertebral discs and destroys them, so that ultimately there may be superficial erosion of a number of vertebrae and also want of continuity between the bodies owing to the destruction of the discs. Hence the curvature in these cases is usually gradual and of considerable extent; it is increased by absorption of the upper and lower surfaces of the adjacent bodies. This form of the disease occurs more especially in adults and is often associated with abscess ; at first there may be no curvature and later only a gradual bend resulting from the loss of a number of inter-vertebral cartilages. This periostitis may occur either as a primary disease, or may be secondar}^ to a deposit in the substance of the bone which has reached the surface.

240 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS should be put up with the forearm looking forward in the position already recommended on p. 236. Middeldorpf's sphnt (see Vol. II. p. 324) is very suitable. When there is already actual anchylosis of the joint, the head of the bone must be removed in situ at the level of the anatomical neck with a chisel of suitable breadth, the soft parts on the inner and posterior aspects Fig. 98.—Removal of the Head of the Humerus in Excision of the Shoulder.

The soft parts are protected by a flexible copper spatula suitably bent, and the saw is applied as shown above. of the joint being protected from damage by a flexible copper spatula which is pushed in around the head of the bone. A second bone section is then made through the glenoid cavity, and the portion of bone thus detached is removed with lion forceps. In these cases it is simpler to use a Gigli's wire saw for the division of the neck of the bone ; it can be passed round the bone by means of a special introducer (see p. 33.)

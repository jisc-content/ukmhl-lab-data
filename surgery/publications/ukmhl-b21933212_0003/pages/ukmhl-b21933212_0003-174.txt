140 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS an anesthetic, and is due to adhesions about the joint, the latter may be treated by occasional movement under an anaesthetic, combined with daily passive and active movements. When, however, the muscles are permanently shortened, recovery cannot take place until their tendons have been divided. After this operation the joint must be fixed in proper position until union of the divided ends of the tendons has occurred, or, at any rate, for two or three weeks; the apparatus meanwhile should be removed daily, and massage and electrical treatment {vide supra) should be practised. When there is excessive pain, it has been proposed to excise the joint or amputate the affected limb, but this should never be done. The pain recurs either in another joint or in the nerves of the limb, fresh ampu- tations may be called for, and the patient is not benefited at all. No active surgical intervention should be adopted for hj'sterical joints in adults. It is well to bear in mind that a joint that has been the seat of an hysterical affection may become affected with some organic lesion, in which case it will be necessary to treat the latter ; while doing so, the fact that the patient is neurotic must influence the treatment to a certain extent.

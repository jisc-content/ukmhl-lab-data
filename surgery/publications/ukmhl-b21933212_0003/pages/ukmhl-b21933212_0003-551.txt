HARE-LIP 517 In many cases the nostril may be unduly broad, although the cleft does not extend into it, and it will be necessary to remedy this also. Under these circumstances, the concave incision should be carried verti- cally upwards from the apex of the cleft into the nostril on each side and the ala freely detached from the bone. The narrow vertical strip of the whole thickness of the hp included between the two vertical incisions A B Fig. 241.—Operation for Simple Hare-lip with widening of the Nostril.

It is very important to insert one stitch within the nostril at the upper end of the incision. 2. Of a Complete Cleft of the lip.—Many operations are em- ployed for complete clefts of the lip; we shall only describe those that we usually employ. A B c Fig. 242.—Mirault's Operation for Hare-lip. The steps of the operation are described in the text. Undue widening of the nostril is corrected by carrying the incision well up into it, as shown in the figure. When there is a complete cleft of tlie lip without deformity of the alveolus, the first step in the operation is to detach the margins of the cleft from the gum on both sides ; this must be continued upwards until the upper border of the hp on the affected side is separated from the bony nostril. The ala of the nose on the same side is then widely detached and the cheek sufficiently freed to allow the margins of the cleft to be approximated without any tension. The edges of the cleft are then pared in the following manner: A narrow, sharp-bladed knife

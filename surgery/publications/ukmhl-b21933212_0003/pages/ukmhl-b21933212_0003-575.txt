CLEFT PALATE 541 G H Fig. 266.â€”Brophy's Operation. Inserting and hcisling the wire sutures. E, one of the anterior pair of wires has been withdrawn from the right maxilla and has been threaded through the front loop of silk, which is about to draw it through the preraaxillary process. F, shows the front wire passing through the premaxillary process. G, all the wires having been placed in their correct positions, perforated lead plates are threaded upon them. As the jaws are slowly approximated by gentle digital pressure, the ends of wires 2 and 3 are twisted together, the first and last wires (i and 4) are brought forwards and their respective ends twisted together in front of the pre- maxillary process ; A and B show the perforated lead plates. H, the maxillte are being brought into contact and the front part of the cleft has been closed. For the sake of clearness the wires and their twisted ends are shown at a little distance from the jaws In reality they would of course lie close to the lead plates and the gums.

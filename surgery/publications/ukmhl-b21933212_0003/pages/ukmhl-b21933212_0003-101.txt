DISLOCATIONS OF THE PATELLA 67 either side of tlie patella ; from the one on the inner side an elliptical portion of the cicatricial tissue which represents the capsule is excised (see Fig. 36). Reduction is then c^uite easy. The important points are to divide the capsule on the outer side freely enough to allow the patella to come into place, and to excise through the inner incision enough of the capsule and the cicatricial tissue to keep the pateha in position Fig. 36.—Diagrammatic Representation of the OpERAnoN for Unreduced Dislocation of the Patella. A, The first stage of the operation.—A free vertical incision is made on tlie side of the patella towards which it is dislocated, whilf the cicatricial tissue formed about the rent in the capsule on the opposite side is excised by means of an elliptical incision. B, The final stage.—When the patella is pulled into position, the gap on the inner side is sutured, and the incision on the outer side becomes an oval aperture. when the edges of the gap in the capsule are stitched together (see Fig. 36). The limb is put on a back sphnt ni the semi-flexed position, and, when the wound has healed, the treatment is similar to that of outward disloca- tion of the patella (see p. 65). Spontaneous movement, however, should not be allowed until five weeks after the operation, when the patient may be allowed to walk, wearing an elastic bandage.

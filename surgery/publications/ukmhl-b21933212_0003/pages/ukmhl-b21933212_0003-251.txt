217 CHAPTER XXI. DISEASES OF THE ANKLE-JOINT AND TARSUS. Very little need be said concerning the non-tuberculous affections of these joints ; their treatment has already been fully described in speaking of these diseases in general. ACUTE ARTHRITIS OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. This may be either suppurative—when it is most commonly either of pysemic origin or is secondary to osteo-myelitis—or it may be non- suppurative, when it either results from an injury such as a sprain, or is associated with some general disease such as rheumatism, gout, or gonorrhoea; the ankle and tarsus are common seats of gonococcal disease, and acute flat foot is very often due to this infection. TRBATMEINT.-—When there is no suppuration in the ankle-joint, the joint should be placed at rest in the first instance. It is important to remember that there is a constant tendency to pointing of the toes when the ankle-joint is fixed, and this must be carefully guarded against, as it is very difficult to overcome afterwards. The foot must be kept at right angles to the leg. Perhaps the best splints are lateral splints of poroplastic, or plaster of Paris (Croft's). As soon after the subsidence of the acute symptoms as possible massage and passive movements should be commenced. When there is suppuration i)i tJie ankle-joint.—The presence of pus will be shown by increasing distension of the joint, great pain, oedema and severe febrile symptoms. Incisions must be made on each side of the extensor tendons over the front of the joint, and, if possible, behind also. It is a point of great importance to avoid wounding the tendon sheaths, otherwise a disastrous suppurative teno-synovitis may be set up. When efficient drainage has been provided, the case is treated on the lines already laid down for suppuration of joints (see p. 94). Care must be taken to keep the foot at right angles to the leg.

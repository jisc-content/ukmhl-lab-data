514 CHAPTER XLII. HARE-LIP AND CLEFT PALATE. It is best to consider these two deformities together, as they are commonly associated, and the treatment of the one condition is often prehminary to that of the other. HARE-LIP. Hare-lip is a gap or cleft in the upper lip of congenital origin, resulting from failure in the union of its component parts. It is usually unilateral, and generally on the left side, although it may be on the right. It is not uncommonly bilateral (double hare-lip), and it may or may not be accompanied by cleft palate. The defect in the lip varies in extent from a mere notch in the red line to a wide cleft extending upwards into the nostril. In the latter case there is generally also a cleft of the alveolar margin and of the palate, and in addition the nostril on the affected side is unduly widened. When the cleft only affects the red line, the rest of the lip may be normal, but even then the nostril on that side is often broader than on the other. When the gap is wide and there is an extensive cleft in the palate, the edge of the cleft in the lip on one or both sides is bound down to the alveolus by a broad fold of mucous membrane. When the cleft is bilateral, the intervening portion of the lip, which is called the prolabium, lies over the pre-maxillary bone ; this is of variable size, and there is a gap between it and the superior maxilla on both sides. The central portion of the lip may be quite small, and the columella rudimentary, so that the tip of the nose is bound down to this central portion and the nose itself is flattened. The pre-maxillary bone is usually tilted forwards and attached to the septum nasi ; in bad cases, in which the prolabium is quite small, it may be only connected with the columna nasi.

AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD 484 of the skull and raised along with the brain above it, and the ganglion looked for. During this stage of the operation a powerful electric fore- head lamp is a necessity ; the ganglion lies so deep, and the wound is so often obscured with blood that the structures cannot be identified clearly without a good light. The dura mater is separated by sweeping a blunt instrument around the edge of the opening in the skull between it and the bone, and raised with broad retractors until the floor of the middle fossa is well exposed (see Fig. 220). The dura mater is pushed gradually upwards and inwards, the brain being gently moulded into its new position and not violently compressed. The only complica- tion likely to be met with at this stage is injury to the middle meningeal trunk as it emerges from the foramen spinosum, but with care this can usually be avoided ; should it be necessary to divide the artery, the best plan is to cut it across between ligatures about half an inch from the foramen. Should the vessel be torn just as it passes out of the foramen, the bleeding is apt to cause trouble ; if the lower end of the artery can be seized in forceps, it should be twisted and pushed into the foramen spinosum. Failing this, Horsley's wax may be applied to the foramen. When the dura mater has been lifted well up, the surgeon will recognise the third division of the trigeminal nerve passing almost vertically down- wards from the Gasserian ganglion to the foramen ovale which lies internal to, and a little in front of, the foramen spinosum, and it is here that the serious difficulties of the operation begin. The best procedure is to define the nerve clearly with a fine dissector, and then to cut it across with a pair of fine scissors or a tenotome ; the divided end is seized in a pair of

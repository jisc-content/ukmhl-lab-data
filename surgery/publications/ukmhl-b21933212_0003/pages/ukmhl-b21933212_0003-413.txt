379 COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN out at one corner of the flap. This is kept in position for two or three days. HEMORRHAGE FROM THE VESSELS OF THE PIA MATER.—In some cases the pia mater may be lacerated and haemorrhage then takes place upon the surface of the brain, into its substance, or between the convolutions. Usually a force sufficient to tear the pia mater also lacerates the brain, so that the case becomes one of laceration of the brain with haemorrhage on the surface, and consequently the symptoms are those of concussion and laceration of the brain, followed afterwards by symptoms of compression. The compression symptoms Fig. i6o.—Incision of the Dura Mater for Sub-dural Haemorrhage. A small nick is first made in the dura with a knife and one blade of a pair of fine blunt-pointed scissors is inserted in it. The incision in the dura mater is indicated by the dotted line ; it should be about a quarter of an inch from the bony margin of the aperture. are, however, not so severe as those produced by haemorrhage from an artery such as the middle meningeal, and they are more localised because the damage is confined to a portion of the cortex. Treatment.—The question of operation is determined by the amount of compression. If there is distinct evidence of pressure upon a particular centre, even though there are no general symptoms of com- pression, it is well to open the skull over that point and remove the clot. If left, the pressure of the clot may cause softening of the brain beneath and permanent damage ; or the clot may be imperfectly absorbed, when a blood-cyst is produced, leading to permanent pressure on the brain ; or the organisation of the clot may cause adhesions between tlie

339 2 ^ CHAPTER XXX. FRACTURES OF THE SKULL. Fractures of the skull vary in cliaracter and gravity according to various circumstances. Thus, the situation of the fracture is of im- portance, the chief point being whether it involves the vault or the base. The fracture may be slight (simple fissure) or very extensive (comminuted fracture) ; it may be complete, or only one table may be injured ; the broken pieces may be depressed, or not. The character of the instrument which inflicts the injury is also of great importance. The effects of injuries which are sufficiently severe to produce a fracture of the skull are not limited to the bone itself. Various complica- tions may ensue ; among the most important are concussion, laceration, and compression of the brain ; septic complications, such as erysipelas and cellulitis of the scalp, osteo-myelitis of the skuU, lepto-meningitis, or cerebral abscess ; hernia cerebri; paralyses of motion, sensation or special sense, subsequent mental derangements, persistent headaches, or traumatic epilepsy. These complications will be considered in detail later on. In the present chapter we shall simply deal with fractures per se, classifying them, according to their situation, into those of the vault and those of the base. Gunshot injuries of the head, altliough strictly included under these headings, will, for convenience, be considered in a separate section. FRACTURES OF THE VAULT OF THE SKULL. These fractures are generally due to direct violence, though some- times thej^ are merely upward extensions of a widespread fracture of the base ; the whole thickness of the skull may be involved or one table only may be broken. FRACTURE OF THE EXTERNAL TABLE ALONE. In some cases, especially when the injury has been inflicted with a sharp instrument and the blow has fallen obliquely upon the skull, the outer table alone may be injured. This form of injury may also occur in

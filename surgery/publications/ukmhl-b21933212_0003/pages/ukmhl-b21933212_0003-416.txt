382 CHAPTER XXXIII. INTRA-CRANIAL SUPPURATION. The following forms of intra-cranial suppuration may foUow injuries, especially compound fractures : (i) Suppuration between the dura mater and the skull (extra-dural suppuration) ; (2) localised suppuration beneath the dura mater (sub-dural suppuration) ; (3) diffuse lepto- meningitis ; and (4) cerebral abscess. Intra-cranial suppuration may also arise as the result of suppurating wounds of the scalp or necrosis of the skull, or of suppuration in the frontal sinus, the middle ear, and the mastoid antrum. The processes are very similar whether they are due to injury or disease, but it will be more convenient, as far as treatment is concerned, to speak first of intra-cranial suppuration as it arises after an injury, and subsequently as it originates from disease, notably of the middle ear. Although it is convenient to describe these various types of sup- puration in separate sections, in practice the distinction between them is less marked, because the suppuration does not always remain limited to one situation or type. Considerable help in the diagnosis can often be obtained by the study of a sample of the cerebro-spinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture. This method should never be neglected ; lumbar puncture is a harmless procedure and may also have a distinct curative effect (see p. 442). INTRA-CRANIAL SUPPURATION FOLLOWING INJURY. EXTRA-DURAL SUPPURATION. This condition rarely follows an injury unless there is an external wound, and most often occurs in connection with compound fracture. It may, however, result from an acute osteo-myelitis following an injury without an external wound. The affection begins as an inflammatory thickening of the outer surface of the dura mater with effusion of

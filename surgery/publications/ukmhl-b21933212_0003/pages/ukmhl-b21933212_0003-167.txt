133 SYPHILIS gummatous material as possible, and to remove any diseased bone or any sequestrum that may be present. In this way the amount of morbid material that has to be removed by the agency of drugs is much diminished, and the prospects of a speedy cure are proportionately increased. JOINT AFFECTIONS IN HEREDITARY SYPHILIS. It is not uncommon for a joint to become affected in hereditary syphilis as the result of the inflammatory condition of the articular ends of the bone known as osteo-chondritis (see Vol. II. p. 462). As a rule, tliere is simply some effusion into the joint cavity without any definite syphilitic affection of the joint structures ; sometimes, however, there may be a deposit of gummatous material in the synovial membrane. The condition is most common in the knee, generally on both sides, and may or may not be associated with the presence of gummata in the epiphyses. TREjATMBNT.â€”This is essentially that already described for here- ditary syphilis (see Vol. II. p. 462, and Vol. I. p. 236). The treatment usually results in complete recovery. SYPHILITIC DACTYLITIS. There is an affection termed dactylitis syphilitica, which occurs in hereditary syphilis and is often confounded with the strumous form. In syphilis, the affection is primary in one of the joints, whereas in the strumous variety it is an osteo-myelitis of the phalanx. Syphilitic dactylitis is usually multiple, affecting the joints in several fingers, and giving rise to a fusiform swelling, the centre of which is opposite the affected articulation. It is due to a gummatous infiltration of the synovial membrane, and yields readily to the treatment appropriate for hereditary syphilis.

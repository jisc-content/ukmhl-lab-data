AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS 52 point should be carried upwards along the neck of the metacarpal bone. After the ligament has been divided, the manipulations described above wiU generally reduce the dislocation. It is however difficult to carry out the subcutaneous incision effectually, and it cannot be recommended in preference to the open method. When the dislocation has remained unreduced for a long time, it will Fig. 27.â€”Forceps for reducing Dislocations of the Thumb. The traction is made by these forceps in an exactly similar manner to that shown in the preceding figures. be necessary to remove the head of the metacarpal bone. This is a simple operation, and, if sufficient bone be taken away, the raw end of the bone covered by a flap of soft parts according to Murphy's method (see p. 153), and passive movement properly carried out, a satisfactory result will be obtained. It is seldom necessary to remove any portion of the phalanx. Similar procedures may be required for dislocations at other metacarpo-phalangeal joints.

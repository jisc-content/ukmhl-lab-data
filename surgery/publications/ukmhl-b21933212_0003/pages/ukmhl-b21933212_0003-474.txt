440 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD fibres held aside by retractors. A three-quarter or one inch trepliine is apphed, and after the circle of bone has been removed, the dura mater is separated all round the opening, which is enlarged by- suitable forceps in all directions until enough bone has been taken away, (see Fig. 195). An extensive incision is then made in the dura mater, any bleeding vessels being ligatured or under-run on its outer aspect. The muscle and fascia are sutured in position, and the skin flap is sewn up (see Fig. 196). A thick mass of dressing is firmly bandaged on. Fig. 196.'—Cushing's Temporal Decompression. Vniling the soft parts over the herniated brain. The fibres of the temporal muscle are united, and then the temporal fascia; finally, the skin is sutured accuratel}-. The Occipital operation.—In this region the muscles and skin flap are turned down together, a curved incision being made along the superior curved line of the occipital bone, extending fiom the posterior border of one mastoid process to a corresponding point on the other side. The occipital bone is trephined on each side of the middle line ; in doing this the positions of the superior longitudinal, lateral, and inferior longitudinal sinuses, must be borne in mind. The portion of bone over the latter sinus may be removed by a Gigh's saw, after careful separation of the sinus from the bone by means of the special introducer kept close to the bone (see Figs 197 and 198). The subsequent steps are the same as in the temporal operation. This region is

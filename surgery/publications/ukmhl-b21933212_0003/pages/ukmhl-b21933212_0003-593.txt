559 NEW GROWTHS OF THE PAROTID GLAND again over the angle as far as the anterior border of the masseter. This flap of skin and fat must be turned forwards over the face. If the gland extends downwards into the neck to any extent, it is well to add an incision along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The lower and posterior part of the gland should then be lifted gradually from its bed. This can usually be done by dividing the deep fascia at the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, gradually separating the tissues with the handle of the knife and pulling the gland forwards. After a time the external carotid artery is exposed as it passes beneath the gland, and this vessel should be clamped and divided. The facial nerve enters aj; the posterior margin and divides into two main branches, the temporo-facial and the cervico-facial, and should be saved as long as possible, but it is usually out of the question to retain any part ultimately. The deeper lobules of the gland which pass between the mastoid process and the ramus of the jaw and between the internal and external pterygoid muscles are best enucleated with a dissector, great care being taken to avoid injury to veins which might he a source of very considerable difticulty and danger. The shelling-out of the deeper part of the gland is facilitated by pulling the jaw as far forwards as possible. The anterior part of the gland is superficial and is readily removed. The divided end of Stenson's duct should be hgatured with catgut, the bleeding points secured, and the wound stitched up, a drainage tube being inserted at the lower angle. When the skin is implicated, a wide area must be taken away, and it will be necessary to turn in flaps from the neck to fill the gap.

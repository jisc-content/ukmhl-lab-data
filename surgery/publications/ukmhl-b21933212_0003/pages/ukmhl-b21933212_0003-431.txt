SUPPURATIOxN FROM MIDDLE-EAR DISEASE or hydrogen peroxide solution (lo vols.) into the wound occasionally, or by packing a narrow strip of gauze into the cavity with sinus forceps, and removing it rapidly ; a special gauze tape is made for this purpose. After the granulations have been scraped away, the wound is dried, and the walls of the cavity are examined with a bent probe to see whether there are any large cells in the mastoid process communicating with the antrum, or whether there is a sinus leading into the sub-dural space or backwards to the groove of the lateral sinus. If a connection with the sub-dural space is found over the roof of the attic, the bone must be carefully removed so as to permit free drainage, and at the same A B Fig. 167.—Formation of Conchal Flaps after the complete Post-aural OPERATION upon THE MASTOID. In .-1 the lueatus is split to form two flaps which are pulled outwards by the stitches, shown in the diagram. B shows the single conchal flap —denoted by the dotted line and described in the text. time to ascertain whether there is any collection of pus between the dura mater and the bone. Should there be a communication backwards to the lateral sinus, the bone must be opened up, so as to expose the latter freely. The middle ear is then gently curetted, and the malleus and incus removed together with the membrana tympani; the stapes is left in situ. When the cerebral symptoms are indefinite, the operation may end at this point. The cartilage and mucous membrane of the external auditory canal are spht longitudinaUy along their posterior aspect (see Fig. 167, A) and a silkworm-gut suture is then passed through the upper portion of the split meatus near to the point at which the cartilage has been detached

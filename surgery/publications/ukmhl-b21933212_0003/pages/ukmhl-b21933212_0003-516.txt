482 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD commonly employed are shown in Fig. 215. The usual omega-shaped flap {ab) gives very good exposure, but has the disadvantage that the scar is rather noticeable afterwards, and also that the nerve-supply to the orbicularis may be damaged.

After the flap has been reflected the deeper tissues are infiltrated with about half an ounce of a i in 20,000 solution of adrenalin, so as to check oozing, and then the temporal fascia is detached from the upper border of the zygoma, and this process sawn through at each end and pulled forcibly downwards with the masseter muscle attached to it. A little dissection now exposes the coronoid

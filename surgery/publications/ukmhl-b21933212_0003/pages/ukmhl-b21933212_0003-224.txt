CHAPTER XX. DISEASES OF THE KNEE-JOINT. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. ACUTE SYNOVITIS. This is one of the commonest affections of the knee-joint and generally occurs after sprains. It may also be associated with rheumatism, although the true rheumatic inflammation of joints affects the fibrous capsule rather than the synovial membrane. It may also occur without any assignable cause. The symptoms vary with the acuteness of the inflammation, and consist essentially in effusion of fluid into the joint, and a varying amount of pain which is increased on moving the limb. The joint usually assumes the semi-flexed position, the fluid effused is coagulable, the synovial membrane is congested and infiltrated with leucocytes, and, in the more acute cases, its surface may be covered with a layer of fibrin. Adhesions of one part of the capsule to another often occur. At first these adhesions are simply fibrinous; but, if the part be kept at rest, organisation may occur later on, ending in the formation of fibrous tissue and true adhesions, which may be so extensive as to end in complete obliteration of the affected portion of the joint cavity. Adhesions only occur after the fluid effusion has become absorbed or has been removed ; as long as fluid is present, the synovial cavity is distended and its surfaces are separated from each other. TREATMENT.â€”^This largely depends on the acuteness of the inflammation and the character of the effusion. When much fibrin is poured out and the inflammation is acute, there is great probability of adhesions forming afterwards, and the treatment must be mainly directed to their prevention. In synovitis occurring in connection with slight sprains, there is little tendency to adhesion; and the trouble will sub- side quickty if elastic pressure, either by means of an elastic bandage or a I go

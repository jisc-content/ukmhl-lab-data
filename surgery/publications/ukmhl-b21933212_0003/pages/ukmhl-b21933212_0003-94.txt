AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS 6o circumducting it inwards. Indeed, it commonly happens during the attempts to reduce the dislocation that the head of the bone shps past the lower margin of the acetabulum and travels round upon the dorsum of the ihum. When a dorsal dislocation has thus been produced, reduction can be effected by the manipulations described on p. 55. (b) Pubic dislocation.—In this form manipulations should be com- bined with traction, as there is generally difficulty in flexing the thigh to its full extent owing to the neck of the bone hitching against the brim of the pelvis. The patient is ansesthetised, and the thigh flexed as far as possible and abducted so as to disengage the head of the bone from the Fig. 34.—Reduction of a Thyroid Dislocation by Traction. This closely resembles the traction method for the dorsal dislocations, except that a second assistant makes traction outwards at right angles to the long axis of the femur with a towel passed round the limb, so as to pull the head of the bone outwards from the thyroid foramen. brim of the pelvis. Outward traction is then applied by means of a jack-towel passed transversely around the upper third of the thigh so as to pull the head of the bone downwards and outwards and disengage it from the pubes. The limb can then be more fully flexed, and it should be further abducted and rotated inwards, which completes the disengage- ment of the head. The lateral traction may now be relaxed, and the dislocation can be reduced by rotating and circumducting the limb inwards, and finally bringing it down parallel to the sound limb as for reduction of thyroid dislocations. This plan of combining manipulation and traction aims at converting the pubic dislocation into the thyroid form by disengaging the head of the bone from the brim of the pelvis.

10 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS forwards. The flap is dissected back, and the joint exposed. The dislocated surfaces can then be seen and the articular ends are drilled obliquely and a wire (No. 5 French gauge) passed and twisted up so as to retain them in good position. When the wound has healed passive movements may be begun, and if necessary, the wire may be removed some months later. Should it be impossible to get the articular surfaces into apposition— as may be the case in in- juries of long standing and with much displacement— there will be no alternative but to remove the joint surfaces with a chisel and then to wire the ends of the bones together. Of Dislocation down- wards.^—When the end of the clavicle is wedged be- neath the acromion or the coracoid process, it wiU generally be easy to disen- tangle the bone under an anaesthetic by carrying the shoulder forcibly backwards and outwards. There is little tendency to upward displacement after reduc- tion and no likelihood of the downward displacement recurring, as the weight of the limb is sufficient to pre- vent that. The arm should be fixed to the side, and the elbow supported in a large elbow-sling for a few days, during which time massage and passive movements are employed. DISLOCATION OF THE STERNAL END. Owing to the great strength of the rhomboid ligament, dislocation of the sternal end only occurs as the result of extreme violence ; this accident is therefore rare and usually accompanied by other serious injuries. The commonest displacement is forwards, in front of the sternum, but the sternal end may be driven backwards behind that bone, or directly in- wards, so that it lies in the supra-sternal notch. The dislocation generally results from violence applied to the point of the shoulder, and its exact Fig. 2.—Shoulder lap Ari'Lihu for Dislocation of THE Acromial End of the Clavicle. There is a pad over the acromial end of the clavicle beneath the shoulder-cap which is firmly buckled to the elbovv-sling.

19 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER surgeon sits facing him on the affected side, and after removing his boot, places his foot in the axilla. The pressure of the foot should be somewhat outwards towards the arm, the object being partly to fix the scapula and partly to provide a fulcrum which will force the head of the bone outwards into position as traction is made. If the pressure be made too much inwards, the vessels and nerves may be bruised, or indeed the ribs may be fractured. The forearm is seized above the Fig. 8.â€”Kocher's Meiiiod 01. Keducimg Dislocations of the Shoulder. Final Stage. The elbow is now brought down to the side. wrist and steady traction is made downwards and somewhat outwards, the surgeon leaning a little away from the patient for the purpose (see Fig. 13). After the traction has been continued long enough to tire out the muscles, the limb is approximated to the side by carrying the fore- arm nearly to the middle line of the tmnk, with the result that the head of the bone is felt to slip into position (see Fig. 14). In sub-glenoid dislocations, traction, either transversely to the trunk or with the heel in the axilla, readily brings the head of the bone into

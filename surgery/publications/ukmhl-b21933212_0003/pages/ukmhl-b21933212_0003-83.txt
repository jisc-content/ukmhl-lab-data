49 DISLOCATIONS OF THE PHALANGES metacarpo-phalangeal joint usually occurs from blows or falls upon the abducted thumb. The extremity of the thumb is driven backwards, so that the anterior ligament is overstretched and ruptured ; the base of the first phalanx passes backwards, and the head of the metacarpal bone projects forwards through the rent in the anterior part of the capsule, the two sesamoid bones near the insertion of the flexor brevis poUicis also em- bracing the neck of the bone, one on either side. The ruptured glenoid ligament is carried backwards on to posterior surface of the neck of the metacarpal, and forms another obstacle to reduction (see Fig. 24). Treatment.—In a recent case, reduction is attempted by trying to Fig. 24.—Dislocation of the Thumb. A is a view from the palmar surface showing tlie head of the metacarpal bone projecting between the heads of the flexor brevis pollicis. B is a view from the dorsal surface showing how the remains of the glenoid ligament is carried on to the dorsal surface of the metacarpal. The dotted line shows where it is divided. disengage the head of the metacarpal bone from the flexor brevis which embraces it and also to pass it back through the rent in the capsule. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is flexed into the palm and firmly fixed by one hand, whilst the thumb is grasped with the other and hyper-extended almost to a right angle, strong traction being also exerted (see Fig. 25). The object is to disengage the anterior edge of the base of the phalanx from the posterior aspect of the head of the metacarpal. It is often difficult to apply sufficient traction with the unaided fingers, but con- siderable help may be got either by a clove-hitch around the thumb or by special forceps invented for the purpose (see Fig. 27). When sufficient traction has been applied in the hyper-extended position, the III. E A B

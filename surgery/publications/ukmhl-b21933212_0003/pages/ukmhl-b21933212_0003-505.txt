CHAPTER XL TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA. Neuralgia of one or more of the branches of the fifth nerve is not uncommon. The disease mav be confined to a single branch, or all the main trunks mav be affected ; it often commences in one branch and extends thence to the whole nerve. The pain is generally intermittent and is frequently accompanied by spasmodic contractions of the facial muscles—the condition known as ' spasmodic tic' In other cases the pain is practically constant and so severe that the patient's life is almost unbearable ; indeed, many ultimately become insane or commit suicide. In the primary or idiopathic cases the affection is a true neuritis, spreading from the terminal branches to the main trunks, and leading in severe cases to changes in the Gasserian ganglion or even in the nuclei of the trigeminal nerve. In the secondary cases, dental caries is a common cause, although the pain may not be referred to the particular tooth that is diseased. The nerve may also be pressed upon by a cicatrix, a foreign body, callus or a tumour, while sometimes the affection ma^' result from a simple osteitis of the wall of the canal in which one of the branches runs. Intra-nasal conditions may also give rise to the affection ; more rarely, it mav depend upon caries of the petrous portion of the temporal bone or upon the presence of an intra-cranial tumour. TREATMENT.—The treatment differs according as the case is primary or secondary. In the secondary cases it is generallv sufiicient—in the earlier stages, at anv rate—to remove the cause ; the affection then subsides and the patient gets well. Should the cause be inaccessible, as it is in disease of the petrous bone, the treatment of the case will be more difficult. In the primary cases, when no exciting cause can be dis- covered and the case is one of simple neuritis, the treatment for that 47^

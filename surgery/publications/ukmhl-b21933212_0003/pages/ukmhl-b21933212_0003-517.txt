483 TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA process of the lower jaw with the temporal tendon attached to it. The latter structure is cut through close to its attachment to the bone, or the coronoid process is sawn through, and the whole of the temporal muscle is turned upwards and kept out of the way with a retractor. This exposes the lateral wall of the skull just above the pterygoid ridge, and the pin of a one-inch trephine is applied at this level opposite to the centre of the zygoma and a circle of bone removed (see Fig. 217). The removal of the crown of bone must be effected with great care, as a wound of the dura mater, wliich it is important to avoid, may occur Fig. 218.â€”Punch Forceps for Cranial Operations. These forceps can be used in very restricted areas and are useful in enlarging the trephine hole downwards towards the base of the skull. very easily owing to the variability in the thickness of the skull. When the crown of bone has been removed, the opening is enlarged in all directions, but especially downwards with cutting pliers or gouges (see Fig. 218). The foramen ovale is identified by detaching some of the fibres of the external pterygoid muscle and finding the third division emerging from it, and the bone between it and the opening in the skull is cut away as freely as possible. At this stage there is generally free bleeding from the pterygoid plexus of veins, but this soon 3aelds to firm sponge pressure. The dura mater is next separated from the floor of the middle fossa 11 2

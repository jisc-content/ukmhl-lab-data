59 DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP (a) Dislocation into the Thyroid {oramen.—Bigelo-w's Method.— The patient is anaesthetised and placed flat upon liis back, whilst the pelvis is fixed and the thigh is flexed and abducted sufficiently to dis- engage the head of the bone from the obturator foramen. The limb is next rotated inwards, strongly adducted and then brought down parallel to its fellow, whilst the inward rotation is kept up (see Fig. 33). This has the effect of fixing the trochanter through the agency of the Y-ligament and the obturator internus tendon, whilst the head of the bone is forced upwards and outwards into the acetabulum. Reduction hv Traction.—Should manipulations fail, the patient should Fig. 33.—Reduction of a Thyroid Dislocation of the Hip by Bigelow's Method. The limb is fully flexed, adducted and rotated inwards, and is finally brought down to the middle line by circumducting it inwards. be placed upon the floor or a low couch, and the thigh flexed to a right angle, and slightly abducted so as to disengage the head of the bone. A strong jack-towel is passed transversely around the upper part of the thigh, and whilst an assistant fixes the pelvis, the surgeon makes extension vertically upwards with the limb rotated somewhat inwards, a second assistant pulling upon the towel so as to drag the head of the bone directly outwards (see Fig. 34). The combined traction should cause the head of the bone to pass into the acetabulum. Should the surgeon fail with both the methods just described, the best thing is to convert the dislocation into one upon the dorsum ilii. This can generally be done by flexing the limb and then forcibly

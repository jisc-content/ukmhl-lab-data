358 CHAPTER XXXI. DISEASES OF THE SKULL. ACUTE PERIOSTITIS AND OSTEO-MYELITIS. This disease usually follows a compound fracture in which there has been septic infection of the diploe, but it may also be due to extension from a septic scalp wound, from operations upon the frontal sinus, from middle-ear disease, or even from inflammations of the skin, such as boils, or carbuncles ; sometimes, though very rarely, it may occur without an external wound. The pathological characters are practically the same as those of the disease elsewhere. In the skull, however, the disease is even more dangerous than it is in the extremities, for it is especially prone to be followed by sinus plilebitis and pyaemia, by lepto-meningitis, or by abscess in the brain, and the great majority of these cases end fatally. The affection extends rapidly over the entire bone first attacked, but it generally stops at the sutures for a time, although eventually it may pass on to the periosteum of adjacent bones. The disease is usually ushered in by a rigor and is followed by a very tender localised oedematous swelling—a condition described by Pott in connection with injuries of the skull and named after him ' PoiVs puffy tumour.' Such a condition in connection with a wound of the scalp should at once arouse a suspicion of acute osteo-myelitis. When the disease occurs in connection with a compound fracture there is generally a marked diminution in the amount of the discharge from the wound, the edges become everted, the granulations unhealthy, and the periosteum recedes from the bone and leaves it bare. TREATMENT.—The diploe must be opened up at once, and if necessary, the whole thickness of the bone should be removed; the sooner and the more thoroughly the operation is performed, the better the chance of recovery. The wound should be enlarged or, if there is no wound, a flap should be turned down. The outer table of the skull is

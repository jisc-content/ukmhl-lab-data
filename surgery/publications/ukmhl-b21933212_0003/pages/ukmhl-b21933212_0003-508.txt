474 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD perforated, and the needle passed on beneath it until it is felt to enter the foramen ovale, which it does at a depth of about 4 cm. The inner boundary of the foramen is composed of a thin plate of bone which, in some cases, projects a short distance downwards beyond the outer boundary of the foramen, so that, if the needle be passed on further, it will impinge on this plate of bone. The foramen has also some consider- able vertical depth. When the foramen is shallow it may be possible in some cases to pass the needle through it into the Cavum Meckelii, and so reach the ganglion itself. Fig. 210.—Lateral view of the Skull showing the landmarks for the INJECTION OF -Alcohol in Trigeminal Neuralgia, a, is the point at which the needle is inserted for injection of the third division or the ganglion itself; b, that for the second; and c, that for the first division. The various measurements and guides are given in the text. Injection of the second division at the foramen rotundiini.—The guide for this procedure is obtained b}^ feeling for the posterior border of the orbital process of the malar bone, and drawing a line vertically down- wards to the lower border of the zygoma. At i cm. behind the point where this line crosses the lower border of the zygoma, the finger will be directly over the foramen. The needle is inserted almost horizontally, with a slight inclination upwards, and should reach the foramen at a depth of about 5 cm. Injection of the first division of the nerve at the sphenoidal fissure.— This nerve is comparatively difficult to inject and is often missed, although the alcohol injected into the tissues surrounding it ultimately reaches the

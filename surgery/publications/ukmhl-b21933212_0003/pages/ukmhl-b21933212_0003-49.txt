15 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER the scapula. It is essential that the entire trunk should be steadied during the manipulations, as otherwise the patient may defeat them entirely by swaying the body about. A good plan is to fasten the trunk to the back of a strong chair by means of a stout jack-towel. The surgeon stands or kneels a little in front of the patient on the affected side, and first flexes the forearm to a right angle and then steadily approximates the elbow to the side (see Fig. 4). This stretches the upper part of the Fig. 4.â€”Kocher's Method of Reducing Dislocations of the Shoulder. Firsl Stage. The trunk is fi.xeci by a stout towel passed round the back of a chair and held by an assistant. The elbow is then flexed to a right angle and approximated to the chest-wall. capsule and causes the head of the bone to hitch against the edge of the glenoid cavity (see Fig. 9). The arm is then rotated outwards until the rotation can be carried no farther (see Fig. 5). This carries the head of the bone outwards from the coracoid process to beneath the acromion, and relaxes the outer and posterior portion of the capsule, which has been unduly on the stretch (see Fig. 10). The whole arm is now brought forwards and upwards, full outward rotation of the humerus being still maintained, until the limb is almost at a right angle to the body (see Fig. 6). This relaxes the front and upper part of the capsule so that the gap in it

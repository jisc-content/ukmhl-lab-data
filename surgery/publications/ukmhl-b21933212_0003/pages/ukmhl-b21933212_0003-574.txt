AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE 540 the pressure of the thumb and fingers, reinforced if necessary by a fiat instrument, such as a broad periosteal elevator. It is most important to twist together the corresponding wires, and a reference to Fig. 266, G. will show how this is done. When the edges of the cleft are nearly in apposition, they should be C D Fig. 265.â€”Brophy's Operation. Passing the silk siilures. A, five stout silk sutures have been inserted ; tlie loops project into the cleft. B, by using two of the loops of the right side as tractors, the silk loops of the left side are drawn across both the maxillcc. C, two of the loops of silk now extend right across both maxilte and the cleft. D, a long piece of stout silver wire has been threaded through the middle loop of silk by which it is about to be drawn through the jaws. Behind this the double wire is shown already in place. The anterior loop is still of silk. (Berry and Lcgg: ' Hare-lip and Cleft Palate.' Churchill, London.) scarified or pared, so as to produce a raw surface on each side along which union may take place. If the pre-maxiha is so prominent that it cannot be placed in its proper position by the pressure of the thumb and fingers, the septum may be divided obliquely a short distance above and behind its attachment, so as to allow of this being done.

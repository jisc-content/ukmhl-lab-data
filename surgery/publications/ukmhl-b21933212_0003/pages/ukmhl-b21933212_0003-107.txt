CHAPTER IX. 73 DISLOCATIONS OF THE ANKLE AND FOOT. DISLOCATIONS OF THE ANKLE. Dislocation of the ankle-joint is not infrequent, hnt in most cases there is also fracture of one of the bones entering into the articulation ; dislocation of the ankle without fracture only occurs in a forward or backward direction, and even in these forms the tip of one or both malleoli may be broken off. The commonest form of dislocation— i.e. the dislocation outwards that is met with in connection with fracture of the lower end of the fibula (Pott's fracture) — has already been described (see Vol. II. p. 416). Of the two forms of disloca- tion uncomplicated by fracture, dislocation of the foot backwards is the more common. The tar- sus is carried bodily backwards behind the tibio - fibular arch, which therefore lies in front of the astragalus and rests upon , 1 • 1 1-11 Fig. 39.—Dislocation of the Foot Backwards. the scaphoid and cuboid bones. The entire tarsus is carried backwards. The accident generally results from severe indirect violence applied when the toes are pointed ; the internal malleolus is not infrequently fractured. Dislocation forwards also occurs from indirect violence, but generally when the foot is in a position of excessive dorsal flexion. TREATMENT.—An aucesthetic is administered and an assistant fixes the leg whilst extension is applied to the foot; as downward traction is made, the deformity is increased in order to disentangle the edge

AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS 50 base of the phalanx is firmly pushed forwards and the thumb is rapidly flexed into the palm (see Fig. 26). By adducting the thumb, the flexor brevis poUicis is relaxed, and by the extension applied to the phalanx the orifice in the capsule through which the head of the metacarpal bone has passed is brought opposite to the head of the bone; by continuing the extension and suddenly flexing the joint, the head of the metacarpal bone is made to pass back through the opening in the capsule. Frequently, however, it is impossible to reduce these dislocations in this manner, and, when that is the case, subcutaneous or open operation is called for ; in our opinion the latter method is the best. A median incision is made over the palmar surface of the articulation, and the protruding head of the matacarpal bone is at once exposed. It is then easy to define the encircUng tendons of the flexor brevis poUicis, and also the rent in the glenoid ligament. The tendons of the flexor brevis are hooked aside and the torn portion of the glenoid ligament is pulled

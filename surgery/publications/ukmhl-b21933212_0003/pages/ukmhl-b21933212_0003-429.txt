SUPPURATION FROM MIDDLE-EAR DISEASE 395 The removal of the bone should be carried out below the temporal ridge, which can always be identified, and the opening should be deepened especially at the iipper and anterior part of the wound into the auditory meatus, so as to avoid the risk of wounding the lateral siims or the dura mater. Eess bone should be removed as the opening is deepened. When the antral cavity is reached, it can be identified at once by passing a C Fig. 165.â€”^The complete post-aural operation upon the Mastoid Antrum. The three stages of the operation of clearing out the mastoid antrum arc here depicted. In A the antrum (a) has been laid open and gouged out, and the bridge of bone (6) between it and the external auditory meatus is seen. In B this bridge of bone is about to be removed, a bent probe having been introduced beneath it from the antrum to the middle ear. In C the operation has been completed by removing the ossicles, smoothing off all the rough angles, and scraping out the cavity. bent probe into it ; this should run forwards and slightly upwards into the middle ear (see Fig. 165, B). The opening should be enlarged sufficiently to allow the whole of the interior of the antrum to be scraped out and all overhanging edges of bone to be removed. When the course of the disease has been acute, that is to say, when there has been no prolonged middle-ear suppuration, the operation can stop at this stage ; the wound is packed to arrest hfcmorrhage, the end

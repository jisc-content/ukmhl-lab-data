130 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS therefore be put in the foreground. In children the best treatment in most cases is to perform arthrectomy if the joint is accessible. By so doing, the disease is not only removed and the patient cured, but the limb can be restored to its normal position. Any obstacle to re- position after arthrectomy is usually due to a contracted tendon or band of fascia which can be divided. When tenotomy is required it is necessary to employ a fresh knife, so as not to infect the tendon sheath. In adults excision should be employed, and the limb can generally be brought into good position by removing sufficient bone. When the disease is entirely cured and a deformity only is left behind, suitable operative measures for the deformity should be employed. The nature of the operation which may be necessary depends, however, so much upon the particular deformity present that this matter must be dealt with in connection with the individual joints concerned.

AFFECTIONS OF THE SKULL 366 to remove it by means of a burr, or a saw worked by a dental engine, keeping just outside the area of the tumour so as not to have to cut through the very dense bone (see Fig. 153). SARCOMATA AND CARCINOMATA. When these tumours occur on the surface of the skull, they can rarely be completely removed, but when they originate in the interior of the bone, it may be worth while attempting an operation. To do this a large flap must be turned down, and the skull is cut through by means of a circular saw, or a wire saw (see Fig. 18), about an inch beyond the growth and the whole mass removed. When the tumour grows from the diploe or the external table, this operation may be successful, and even when the inner table is thickened by the growth it is worth trying, provided that it be done before serious pressure on the brain has been caused, and before the dura mater has become involved. When, however, the skin over the tumour is so thinned or infiltrated that it has to be removed, the operation cannot be performed, because a large area of the dura mater would be left exposed without any likelihood of healing. No doubt when the defect is small, it might be possible to fiU it in some cases by means of a flap from the arm, as in the method of repairing the nose (see ' Plastic Surgery of the Face '), but when the tumour has attained such a size as to involve the skin to any considerable extent, its complete removal is practically hopeless ; even then, however, excellent results may follow a combination of excision with the X-rays or radium. Coley's fluid may also be tried when the growth is a sarcoma. Carcinomata of the skuU are secondary to carcinoma elsewhere and cannot be dealt with by operative measures. Radium, however, may be of value.

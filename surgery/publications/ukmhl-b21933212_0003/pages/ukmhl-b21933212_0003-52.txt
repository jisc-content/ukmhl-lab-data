i8 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS makes counter-extension by means of a jack-towel passed transversely around the upper part of the chest, while the surgeon keeps up steady traction at right angles to the body (see Fig. 12). If no assistant be present, the surgeon sits upon the floor at right angles to his patient and places his unbooted foot against the axillary border of the scapula so as to fix it while he makes the traction and tires out the muscles. Sometimes the head of the bone slips in with a jerk; but commonly it Fig. 7.—Kocher's Method of Rfducing Dislocations of the Shoulder. Fourth Stage. When the horizontal position is reached, the arm is rotated inwards, the forearm being carried through rather more than a right angle from left to right. does so gradually, so that the surgeon finds when the arm is brought to the side that the dislocation has been reduced. If plenty of assistance is at hand, the extension and counter-extension can be entrusted to assistants, while the surgeon manipidates the head of the bone into place. Downward Tractio7i.—The older method was to reduce the dislocation by means of the heel in the axUla. This is very effectual and is also probably the easiest method for those who have but slight experience. The patient lies upon his back on a couch or on the ground, and the

38 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS the humerus, whereas, if the soft parts be torn through, the coronoid process may pass backwards until it lodges in the olecranon fossa. The essential factor that determines whether the displacement shall be simply backwards or to one side as well is the direction of the force producing the injury. If the arm be driven inwards or outwards as the ligaments give way, the dislocation will be both backwards and to one side. Dislocation of the elbow may be comphcated with a fracture of some Fig. 20.—Method of Reducing a Dislocation of Both Bones of the Forearm Backwards. The knee fixes the lower end of the humerus. Traction is made with the limb as nearly extended as possible, and then the joint is flexed across the knee. part of the articular surfaces or with injury to vessels or nerves in the neighbourhood. The dislocation may also be compound. TREATMENT.—(a) Of Simple Dislocation—An anaesthetic is generally desirable, and as a rule the bones will slip into place on making extension. Reduction without an anaesthetic may be effected as follows: The surgeon stands sideways in front of the patient (who sits in a chair), puts his foot upon the seat of the chair and inserts the bent knee into the

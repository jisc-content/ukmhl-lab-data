92 SECTION II.—DISEASES OF JOINTS. SUB-SECTION I.—DISEASES OF JOINTS IN GENERAL. CHAPTER XII. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. Inflammation of joints may be either acute or chronic, and the process may involve one or all of the structures entering into the composition of the articulation. ACUTE INFLAMMATION. Acute inflammation may affect either the synovial membrane alone —when it receives the name of acute synovitis ; or the whole of the structures of the joint—when it is spoken of as acute arthritis. ACUTE SYNOVITIS. Acute synovitis ma.y be due to various causes—such as injury, gonorrhoea, specific fevers, or rheumatism. The joint becomes dis- tended with fluid, which is not simply serous, but readily coagulable if blood corpuscles gain access to it. In superficial joints the skin may be reddened ; frequently, however, it is only slightly more vascular than that over the corresponding joint on the opposite side, but it is warmer to the touch. There is pain on pressure over the inflamed joint, although movement or jarring one bone against the other is generally easily borne. As the inflammation subsides, the effused material becomes absorbed, but there is always a tendency to the formation of adhesions between the opposed surfaces of the synovial membrane. Every joint capable of free movement has a synovial membrane which is much more extensive than the joint itself—a condition necessary to allow of proper movement. Hence, in whatever position the joint may be, the synovial membrane is always thrown into folds, the opposing surfaces of which are in contact

CHAPTER XXXIX. 461 AFFECTIONS OF THE LIPS. WOUNDS. There are only a few points of special interest in connection with wounds of the lips. Healing is rapid and satisfactory. TREATMENT.â€”A most important point in closing these wounds is to see that tlie red line of the lip is brought into accurate position. Buried sutures cannot be used when the wound has been inflicted accidentally, on account of the soiling and consequent risk of sepsis. The sutures should be inserted with a round sewing-needle ; fine horse-hair should be used for the skin, whilst catgut may be employed for the mucous membrane. It is well to suture the whole of the wound on the mucous surface with catgut. No dressing is required; the line of incision is dusted with boric acid powder, and a scab forms, under which healing takes place readily. When there has been much loss of substance of the lips, some form of plastic operation will be necessary (see Chapter XLI.). INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. There is little of importance to say concerning these affections. Gan- grene of the lips may occur, and is usually the result of cancrum oris, a disease already described (see Vol. I. p. 85), and seldom seen nowadays. CRACKS AND FISSURES OF THE LIPS. These rather painful affections are not uncommon in cold weather and cause great inconvenience from their constant liability to be torn open. They may also become infected, and acute inflammation or erysipelas may result.

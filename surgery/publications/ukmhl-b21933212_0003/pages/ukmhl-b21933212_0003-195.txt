DISEASES OF THE HIP-JOINT i6i front of the anterior edge of the tensor fascise femoris (see Fig. 56). The incision commences just below the anterior superior iUac spine. After the skin and deep fascia have been divided, the interval between the tensor vaginae femoris and the sartorius is opened; these muscles are separated and held apart by retractors. The loose cellular tissue lying between the deeper muscles is tlien divided ; a large branch of the Fig. 56.â€”Incision for Drainage of the Hip-joint, a, Sartorius ; 6, tensor fasciae femoris; c, capsule of the hip-joint; d, quadriceps. external circumflex iliac artery often requires to be ligatured.

In most cases it is advisable to make a counter-opening posteriorly (see Fig. 48) for a drainage tube (No. 18), a large tube being also placed in the anterior incision. When the discharge has become quite small in amount (not covering an area on the dressing greater than a shilling in twenty-four hours), the in. M

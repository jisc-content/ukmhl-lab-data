AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS 96 Fig. 48.—Drainage of a SurpURATiNG Hip-joint. drain the posterior part of the joint (see Fig. 48). In the ankle, an opening should be made in front of each maheolus and another behind the inner malleolus so as to drain the posterior part of the joint (see Fig. 49). In the elbow, incisions should be made on each side of the olecranon so as to drain the olecranon fossa, and others in front of each condyle so as to drain the front of the joint (see Fig. 50). In the shoulder, the best drainage is obtained through the vertical incision usually employed for excision of the shoulder (see Chap. XXII.) reinforced by another just in front of the posterior fold of the axilla which will drain the posterior part of the capsule (see Fig. 51). In the wrisi, proper drainage is very difficult to obtain, and can only be got by laying the joint freely open in several places, especially on the posterior and inner aspects (see Fig. 52). The limb should be fixed upon a wire splini with the joint in the position that will be most use- ful when anchylosis occurs. The afier-treatment is identical with that for a suppurating wound of a joint (see p. 87) ; continuous irrigation is the most useful plan in the early stage. As the discharge diminishes boric fomentations or cyanide dressings may be substituted for the irrigation and the drainage tubes should be gradually shortened until finally they are removed. It is well to leave to the last those that drain the most dependent parts of the joint. In the knee-joint, for example, the lateral drainage tubes should be shortened so that they project from the lateral aspect of the limb and Fig. 49.—Drainage of a Suppurating ' Ankle- joint.

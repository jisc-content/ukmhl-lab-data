DISEASES OF THE HIP-JOINT 189 TREATMENT.—The treatment is mainly directed to fixing the joint and enabhng the patient to get about. In the earher stages he should, if possible, be taken oiS his feet entirely, and confined either to bed or to a couch ; at the same time, matters should be so arranged that he is able to get out in the air, and for this purpose he may have a Bath chair. When the acuter symptoms have subsided, a Hessing's splint may be employed, and the patient allowed to walk about. HYSTERICAL HIP. Hysterical joint disease is very common in the hip and is generally marked by muscular contraction and the assumption of vicious attitudes. The trouble often occurs after some injury, and is distinguished from hip-joint disease by the diffuseness of the pain and its superficial character. There is an entire absence of any of the signs of disease of the joint, such as thickening around it. In the early stages also, the limb can be moved without any difficulty under an anaesthetic, and no grating can be felt. TREATMENT.—The treatment has been fully discussed (see p. 137), and little more need be added here. In the later stages true shortening of the muscles may occur, and it may be necessary to perform tenotomy, after which the limb must be kept in position by extension apparatus or splints. The muscles that usually require division are the adductors, which should be divided on the inner side of the thigh just below their origin from the ramus of the pubes; the tensor fascia; femoris may also be shortened. Sometimes the rectus may be contracted and it is then best to make an incision between the inner border of the tensor fasciae femoris and the sartorius, close to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and then, separating these muscles, to define the tendon of the rectus and divide it.

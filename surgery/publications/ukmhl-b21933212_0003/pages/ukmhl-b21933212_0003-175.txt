141 CHAPTER XVI. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: OSTEO-ARTHRITIS. ACUTE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. This disease occurs especially in young female subjects, and luns an acute or subacute course. Some authors consider that the affection is related to rheumatism, some that it is due to an altered condition of the blood, some to reflex irritation, some again to disease of the anterior cornua of the spinal cord; while lately Bannatyne and Blaxall have described micro-organisms, to which it is possible that the disease may be due. The affection may be preceded by vague neuralgic pains and usually begins in the smaller joints, particularly the fingers, which become swollen and hot ; there may be pyrexia of the hectic type. The disease apparently begins in the synovial membrane and is accompanied by some effusion into the joint in tlie first instance, while softening and destruction of the cartilage, with erosion of the subjacent bone, set in before long. The joint becomes swollen and the ends of the bones are apparently enlarged, though radiograms show that this is not so in the early stage, and that the appearance is due partly to swelling of the synovial membrane, and partly to wasting of the muscles in the neighbourhood of the joint. The disease is frequently accompanied by considerable anaemia, and there is often pigmentation of the skin. A marked feature is the muscular wasting, which is too rapid and too extensive to be accounted for by mere disuse. When the fingers are affected, the joints become spindle-shaped and the digits are deflected to the ulnar side. TREATMENT.â€”The affected limb should be put upon a splint and the joint aspirated if necessary. Guaiacol and cod-liver oil should be administered, and it is well to send the patient to a suitable place where thermal treatment may be obtained ; the latter point is referred to below. These cases usually come under the care of the physician, and need not be further considered here.

AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE 496 membrane is brought out and stitched to the skin, so as to form a lip covered with mucous membrane. When the skin is lax, a narrow triangular portion of skin, with its base near the proposed new angle of the mouth, is first raised (see Fig. 227), and the cheek is then split to the necessary extent. The flap of skin is A B Fig. 227.—Dieffenbach's Operation for Microstoma. A small triangular flap is first dissected up, and then the angle of the mouth is split along the dotted line shown in A. The flap is now turned in around the new angle and sutured as shown in B. then turned in, and sutured to the mucous membrane, and thus covers the new angle and prevents any contraction spreading from that point. The rest of the raw surface is covered by suturing the mucous membrane to the skin in the manner described above. This plan is very valuable when it can be employed ; without it, contraction is apt to occur at the angle and to reproduce the deformity. PLASTIC OPERATIONS ON THE CHEEK. The method adopted for repairing defects in the cheek will depend upon the extent of the defect—in particular upon the extent to which the cutaneous or the mucous surfaces are destroyed—and also upon the presence of complications, such as closure of the jaws, or eversion of the lips or eyelids. A recent defect of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, such as occurs after removal of superficial tumours from the cheek, may be closed in various ways according to its size and shape. If the defect is small and oval, its edges can be undennined and stitched together. If, however, the defect is larger and circular or irregular, it may be closed by slcin- grafting or by flaps turned in from the adjoining skin, preferably from that between the defect and the ear, or over the lower jaw or the neck.

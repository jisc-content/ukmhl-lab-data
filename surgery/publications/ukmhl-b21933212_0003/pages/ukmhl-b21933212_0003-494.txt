460 AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE be employed, combined with frequent douching of the nasal cavity with warm normal saline solution. Of long-standing Deformity.â€”The surgeon is sometimes con- sulted with regard to old cases of fracture of the nose, in which there has been considerable loss of substance or marked depression of the bridge, or in which coal-dust or other material has been ground into the soft parts, leaving an unsightly or pigmented scar ; the latter condition has already been referred to on p. 446. The possibility of remedying the permanent deformities of the nasal bones frequently reqiiires very careful consideration. At an early period the bones may be loosened at the line of fracture by introducing a narrow chisel through small incisions in the skin, and they may then be brought into position by lateral pressure, either by the hare-lip pins or by the pads on each side of the nose mentioned above. Sometimes, however, the fracture is of such long standing and consequently so firm that the deformity cannot be remedied in this way. When the bridge of the nose is much depressed, the tilting forward of the nostrils is in itself so unsightly that a more elaborate operation must be performed, similar to that employed for cases in which the bridge of the nose has been lost from disease ; in some cases the subcutaneous injection of paraffin may suffice. These operations are described in connection with the plastic surgery of the face (see Chapter XLL).

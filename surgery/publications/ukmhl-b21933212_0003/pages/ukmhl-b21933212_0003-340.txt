306 AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE Fig. 126.—Method of Application of Phelps's Box. The child lies upon suitable firm cushions made to fit the splint; other similar ones are inserted between the sides of the splint and the body. The legs are kept in their respective troughs by bandages, and the thorax is encircled by a broad towel or folded sheet over the splint. The sketch shows the head fastened to the end of the splint by a headstall, and the child's weight allowed to tell upon it by raising that end of the splint. This produces moderate extension, which is most useful in cases of disease high up. If more powerful extension is required, it can be obtained either by attaching strong india-rubber door-springs on either side of the head of the splint, in place of the buckle shown in the figure, or a cord and a pulley as in Fig. 115.

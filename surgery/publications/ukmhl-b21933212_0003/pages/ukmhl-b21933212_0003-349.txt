This is the name given to chronic osteo-arthritis of the spine, whicli usually occurs in persons past middle age. Alterations take place in the articular surfaces similar to those found in other joints, and outgrowths occur around the margin of the inter-vertebral discs. Osteophytes also form in connection witli the transverse processes, and there is a tendency to ossification of the ligaments and anchylosis of the vertebrae. The spine usually assumes a uniform kyphotic curve, and is rigidly fixed. The symptoms are mainly great pain and increasing rigidity, the pain not being limited to the spine itself, but following the course of any nerves which may be pressed upon as they pass out of the spinal canal. TREIATMEINT.â€”The condition is a very hopeless one. There is no special form of treatment for the spinal affection ; it must be on the lines already detailed (see p. 143) for osteo-arthritis elsewhere. ACUTE OSTEO-MYELITIS. This is an extremely rare ailection, and, beyond pointing out the possibility of its occurrence, we need say very little about it. The con- dition is even more often fatal than in the long bones, possibly on account of the large amount of medullary tissue in the bodies of the vertebrae ; sometimes, however, the patients recover if the condition is diagnosed and the pus evacuated sufficiently early. Only a very few cases are on record.

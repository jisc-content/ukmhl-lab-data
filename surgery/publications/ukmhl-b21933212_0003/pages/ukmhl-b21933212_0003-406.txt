AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD 372 soon clots, and pressure is exercised upon the subjacent brain, varying according to the amount of the clot. When the amount of clot is small, the effects of the pressure are manifested in one hemisphere only, and may possibly be confined to particular centres. As the clot increases in size, however, the entire hemisphere shows the effects of pressure, and in Fig. 154.â€”Middle Meningeal Hemorrhage. The fracture is seen to traverse both the vault and the base of the skull. The situation of the clot is that usually met with. The amount of clot present in the specimen from which the drawing was made is quite moderate; it often exceeds this considerably and gives rise to very extensive cerebral compression. (Helferich.) extensive hsemorrhages the opposite hemisphere is affected as well. As a rule the tendency is for the blood to spread downwards towards the base of the skull, and one of the typical symptoms, namely, dilatation of the pupil on the affected side, is probably due to clot passmg downwards and pressing upon the third nerve. Should the rupture of the artery be accompanied by fracture of the skull, some of the blood escapes beneath

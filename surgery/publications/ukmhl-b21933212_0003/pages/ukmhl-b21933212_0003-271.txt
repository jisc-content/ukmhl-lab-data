237 DISEASES OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT Extension has also been used in cases in which there are severe starting pains at night. If this is to be employed, the patient should be confined to bed, the trunk fixed with sand-bags, counter- extension made by a broad bandage passed around the thorax, and a weight applied by means of a stirrup fixed upon the upper arm, which is kept in the position recommended above (see Fig. 96). In most cases, however, in which the pain is so great as to call for extension, operation is desirable. When there are abscesses in connection with the joint, the question of operation becomes urgent. It is best to treat the abscess first, so as to cure or reduce it in size. The same remark applies to tuberculous disease of the deltoid bursa.

In children, it is true, we should advise that operative interference be delayed as long as possible, as arthrectomy of the shoulder-joint is neither an easy nor a satis- factory operation ; but in adults, in whom the growth of the limb has ceased, the question of excision will arise early in the course of the disease. By it the progress of the disease is cut short, and the patient is given a movable arm which, though weaker than its fellow, is still greatly superior to an anchylosed joint, especially when the limb is in bad position. There is a further reason for advocating early operation,in that shoulder- joint disease is very frequently associated with or followed by disease of the lungs ; the exact connection between the two is difiicult to understand, but it certainly is a clinical fact that a large number of patients with disease of the shoulder-joint suffer also from phthisis, and, in a very considerable proportion, the latter affection only sets in after the joint

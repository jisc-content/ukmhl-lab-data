AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS 256 of the extensor brevior, also cut, while the extensor secundi internodii, with the radial artery, is thrust somewhat outwards. The next step is the separation of the trapezium from the rest of the carpus by cutting forceps applied in a line with the longitudinal part of the incision, great care being taken of the radial artery. The removal of the trapezium is left till the rest of the carpus has been taken away, when it can be dissected Fig. 104,—Lister's Excision of the Wrist to show the Arrangemekt of the Tendons on the Back of the Wrist. The bones are shown in dotted outline. LL, the radial (dorsal) incision (the ulnar incision, being on the front of the wrist, is not shown); A, the radial artery; B, the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii poUicis; C, the tendon of the extensor indicis ; D, the extensor communis digitorum tendons; £, the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti; F, the tendon of the extensor primi internodii pollicis; G, the tendon of the extensor ossis mctacarpi pollicis; H and 7, the tendons of the extcnsores carpi radialis longior et brevior; K, the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris. (Holmes's System of Surgery.) out without much difficulty, whereas its intimate relations with the artery and the neighbouring parts would cause much trouble at an earlier stage. The hand being bent back to relax the extensors, the ulnar incision should next be made very free by entering the knife at least two inches above the end of the ulna immediately anterior to the bone, and carrying it down between the bone and the flexor carpi ulnaris, and on in a straight line as far as the middle of the fifth metacarpal bone at its palmar aspect.

365 NEW GROWTHS EXOSTOSES. Among the commonest tumours met with on the skull are exostoses which are generally of the hard or ivory form. They occur chiefly on the frontal bone, or in the bony auditory meatus. Usually they grow from the external table of the bone and do not cause any symptoms ; some- times, however, they may arise in the neighbourhood of the orbit and may lead to serious pressure on the optic nerve. If the exostosis is situated s c Fig. 153.—Exostoses of the Skull. A shows the ordinary form of the ivory exostosis affecting the outer table only ; the thick black line (a) represents the incision in the skull necessary for its removal. This may be made with a gouge, a parting tool, or a circular saw. If the growth is small enough, the circle may be made with a trephine. B is the same form of growth springing from the inner table, while in C the growth ' (usually spongy) affects the entire thickness of the bone. in the external auditory meatus, the latter may be blocked and thus hearing may be seriously interfered with. TREATMENT.—These ivory exostoses grow very slowly, and need not be interfered with, unless they are causing deformity or pressure symptoms. Their removal is very difficult and not altogether free from risk owing to the extreme density of the growth. Any attempt to chisel away the mass, as is done in spongy exostosis, requires a force that may cause serious jarring of the brain and possibly also fracture of the skull. When the exostosis is quite small and can be enclosed in a trephine, a circle of the bone including the exostosis should be taken out. When, however, the tumour is large and irregular in shape, the best plan is

422 CHAPTER XXXVI. FOCAL EPILEPSY : TUMOURS OF THE BRAIN. FOCAL EPILEPSY. Various operations, such as ligature of the vertebral arteries or division of the sympathetic trunk in the neck, have been introduced for the cure of true epilepsy without any marked success. For focal or Jacksonian epilepsy, however, operation may be of great value. Various causes may give rise to this condition ; they may be situated in the motor areas or at some distance from them. Among them may be mentioned a depressed fracture, in which there is direct pressure by the displaced bone; an osteitis, especially after injury; a localised pachymeningitis, especially the condition known as pachymeningitis interna ; haemori'hages upon the surface of the brain ; cysts or a cerebral tumour pressing on the brain ; the presence of a foreign body such as a bullet ; cicatrices on the surface of the brain after operations ; adhesion of the brain to the dura mater or to the skull, as may occur after opening a cerebral abscess ; or even adhesion of a cicatrix in the scalp to the bone. The spasms may often be provoked by pressure over the affected area. In these cases the attack usually begins in a definite centre, and the muscular spasms commence in one group of muscles and extend in regular sequence to others. They may or may not end in a general convulsion, and in some cases consciousness is not completely lost. The fits may begin without the least warning, and after the inmiediate effects have passed off, the patient may feel quite well again. They may be few in number and occur at long intervals, or they may be quite frequent. They may be followed by a certain amount of stupor or coma similar to the ordinary post-epileptic coma, by temporary paratysis either of sensation or motion, by diplopia, or by various sensory phenomena. It is very important to remember that the onset of Jacksonian epilepsy

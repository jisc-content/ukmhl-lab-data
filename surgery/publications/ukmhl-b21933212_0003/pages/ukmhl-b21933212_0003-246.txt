212 AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS effect, the best treatment is to allow the child to get about and to have the limb well massaged; when growth is nearly complete—at from sixteen to eighteen years of age—the case can be treated as described below. To interfere by operation in the case of children is to incur the risk of destroying the epiphyseal line, with consequent imperfect growth of the limb. In adults the usual plan is to remove a wedge from the bone, so planned as to bring the limb into proper position and then to fix the bones together by plates or wires, so as to obtain bony union. We have Fig. 84.—Cuneiform Excision of the Knee for Anchylosis with Deformity. The thick lines show where the bone will require to be divided in order to get the limb straight. From this it is obvious that the region of the epiphyseal line must necessarily be encroached upon. already referred to Murphy's arthroplasty (see p. 153), which offers a promising alternative to the older plan. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. This affection is common in the knee. The characteristic deformities are flexion and outward rotation of the leg, and there is sometimes a certain amount of genu valgum. The symptoms have already been described (see p. 142). TREATMENT.—There is very httle to add to what has already been said in discussing the treatment of the disease in general (see p. 143). Special care should be taken to remove any septic focus, such as pyorrhoea alveolar is. Operative interference, such as gouging or drilling the condyles of the femur for excessive pain, or removal of osteophytes in the rare instances in which they interfere mechanically with the movements of the limb, may be called for. Excision is also of value in cases in which there is great pain and disability. In speaking ox the treatment of osteo-arthritis in general, we referred to the question of excision of joints in the monarticular form of the disease.

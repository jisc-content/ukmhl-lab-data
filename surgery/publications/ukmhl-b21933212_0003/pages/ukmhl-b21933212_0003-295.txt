When the case is one of infection of a metacarpo- phalangeal joint, the fixation should extend to the wrist-joint also ; otherwise the flexor and extensor tendons keep up a certain amount of movement. When the disease is progressing in spite of treatment, operative measures must be considered, and either excision or amputation may be performed. In some cases excision of the ends of the bones gives a very good result, and leaves a certain amount of movement and a useful finger, but it is rarely that it can be employed, because in this afTection the trouble is apt to spread to the tendon sheaths as they pass over the joint, and excision of the articulation will therefore fail to cure the disease. Hence, when there is disease of the tendon-sheath or of the neighbour- ing bone as well as an affection of the joint, or when abscesses are present, amputation is the better practice, the site of the amputation being dependent upon the joint affected.

547 MALIGNANT DISEASE OF THE AURICLE of the facial nerve. Any attempt to combine removal of malignant glands in the substance of the parotid with preservation of the branches of the facial nerve will almost inevitably be followed by recurrence. When the disease is confined to the interior of the meatus, the removal of the external auditory meatus is not a particularly difficult operation, and when the auricle is healthv it may l)e retained and subsequently stitched back into position. An incision is made in the interior of the auricle around the posterior margin of the meatus, and this is connected at each end with a more or less vertical incision anteriorly, which runs in Fig. 267.â€”Operation for outstanding Auricle. Sutures are used to draw the cut edges of the gap in the cartilage together and a separate layer to suture the skin. front of the tragus. It is usually advisable to extend this vertical incision upwards above the ear to facilitate the pulling forwards of the parotid gland. The soft parts on the posterior surface of the cartilage are left intact, and are pushed backwards along with the remains of the auricle. Tlie incision is now deepened behind down to the bony meatus, while in front it is carried down close to the cartilaginous meatus until the parotid gland is reached. The capsule of the parotid gland is now divided and the gland pulled forwards along with the vessels and nerves whicli it contains ; the cartilaginous portion of the meatus can now be freely exposed.

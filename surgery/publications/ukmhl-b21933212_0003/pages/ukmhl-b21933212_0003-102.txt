CHAPTER VIII. 68 DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE AND ITS CARTILAGES. DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE. Traumatic dislocation of the knee-joint is very rare, as might be expected from a consideration of the size of the joint and the strength of the hga- ments concerned. Severe violence is required to produce dislocation, and hence these injuries are usually either compound or complicated by fracture of the bones in the immediate neighbourhood. "VARIETIES.—The knee may be dislocated forwards, backwards, or to one side, and the dislocation may be complete or incomplete; usually it is incomplete. Dislocation of the Tibia forwards.—This may occur from direct violence, such as a severe blow upon the front of the femoral condyles when the limb is fully extended; the lower end of the femur is driven directly backwards. Generally, however, the accident occurs from indirect violence, as when the foot becomes caught in a hole and fixed, whilst the weight of the body carries the upper end of the femur forward, and thrusts the lower end forcibly backwards against the posterior liga- ment of the knee-joint, which gives way. The other ligaments of the joint are also ruptured to some extent. The popliteal vessels and nerves generally lie in the inter-condyloid notch of the femur and are pressed upon ; should the artery be atheromatous it may be torn across. This is the most common form of dislocation. Dislocation of the Tibia backwards, although common as a result of disease, is rarely of traumatic origin. It may result from violence applied either to the head of the tibia in front or to the lower end of the femur behind, the knee being in a flexed position at the time the injury is received. Lateral dislocations of the knee are still rarer, outward dislocation being perhaps more frequent than the inward form. They are almost always incomplete.

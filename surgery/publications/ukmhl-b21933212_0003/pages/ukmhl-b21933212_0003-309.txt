DISLOCATION AND FRACTURE-DISLOCATION usually due to direct pressure of the fragments of the bones or of blood effused between the cord and the bone. Laminectomy, with the view of relieving the pressure on the cord, should be carried out as soon as possible. \\'hen the depressed bone is removed or the blood-clot cleared out, it is not uncommon for complete recovery to take place, unless the cord has been badly lacerated at the time of the injury. In these cases the position of the patient on the operating table is important. He must be in the fully prone position; but as the breatliing is often largely, and sometimes entirely, diaphrag- FiG. 105.â€”Wiring the Vertebr.ie together after Laminectomy for Fractured Spine. Various methods are shown, the wires uniting the laminae, spines, and transverse processes. Any or all of them may be used. matic the abdominal muscles must have full play. The positions shown in Figs. 106 and 107 are the best for this purpose. The method of performing laminectomy has been described in detail in Vol. II. p. 131, and the details, up to the point when the laminae are exposed, are the same. At this stage the condition of the spines and laminae can be seen, depressed fragments can be removed, spicules of bone clipped away and blood-clot cleared out. It is seldom necessary to open the dura mater, but, should it be deemed advisable, this is best done by a vertical incision, care being tal-cen to tie the vessels as they bleed. The cliief reason for opening the dura mater is to remove blood-clot T

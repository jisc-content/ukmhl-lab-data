SPINA BIFIDA 287 The sac is now pricked and the cerebro-spinal flnid allowed to flow out gradually, the child's head and shoulders being kept dependent so as to avoid too sudden escape of the fluid. The next point is to ascertain whether nerve elements are present in the sac. The opening is gradually and carefully enlarged, and the inner surface of the sac inspected both by touch and sight. The redundant portion of the sac is now excised and the remainder of its wall sutured over the gap. In excising the redundant portion of the sac, the incision should be made to one side, so that the deep line of sutures do not correspond with the sutures in the skin, which Fig. 114.—Excision of a Spina Bifida. A shows the usual elliptical incision thr )ugh the healthy skin surrounding the base of the tumour ; B shows how the cicatrix, a, made by suturing the meninges of the sac, can be made to lie well away from that formed by suturing the skin (6), if the elliptical incision in the meninges is made to one side. lie more or less in the middle line (see Fig. 114, B). The skin-flap is then laid down, and united by a continuous suture, antiseptic dressings applied and the child kept on its face, with the head somewhat dependent, until healing is complete. When the defect in the neural arches is very wide and the coverings of the tumour are almost entirely membranous, it may be impossible to make the flaps meet in the middle line. It will then be necessary either to undermine the skin for some distance around and bring the edges together with stitches of relaxation (see Vol. I. p. 140), or else to perform a plastic operation and turn in a skin- flap from below.

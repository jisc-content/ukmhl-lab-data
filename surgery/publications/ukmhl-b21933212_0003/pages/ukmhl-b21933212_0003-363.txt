329 SCALP WOUNDS bandage may be wound around the skull in the same position and then tightly twisted up by means of a rod. This temporary arrest of haemorrhage in large wounds is important, not only because it is necessary for the proper disinfection of the wound, but also because of the free bleeding which takes place. The wound is now enlarged, if necessary, and cleaned and disinfected in the usual manner. All hair is removed from it, and any portions of tissue which are visibly dirty are clipped away. When the wound has been caused by a blunt instrument and its edges are badly soiled, it is well to cut away a thin slice of the raw surface ; in this way a healthier Fig. 139.—Forceps for H^mostasis in Operations upon the Scalp.

If the bone is soiled it is advisable to chisel off a thin layer of the surface, taking care, however, not to open up the diploe ; unless this is done, infection is apt to spread from the contused area and lead to very serious results. The surface of the bone may then l)e touched with undiluted carbolic acid, so as to disinfect it more ei^ectually. The wound having been disinfected, all bleeding vessels must be tied. When the wound in the scalp is small it is quite easy to pick up the bleeding points with pressiu-e forceps and ligature them after the tourniquet has been relaxed. For this purpose the ' mosquito forceps ' (see Fig. 139, B) are useful. In larger wounds there may be many

AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS 64 may be made to refresh the detached fragments of the acetabulum if they are sufficiently large, and to fix them to the pelvis, or if this is not feasible to scoop out the acetabulum and turn the fragments of bone up as before, so as to provide a buttress for retaining the head of the bone in position. Unfortunately the results are not satisfactory in either case.

95 ACUTE INFLAMMATION case, and large incisions will not interfere with the ultimate usefulness of the limb, while they may make all the difference to the possibility of retaining the limb or of saving the patient's life. For suppuyation in the knee-joint we make long vertical incisions, one on each side of the patella, extending from the top of the sj'novial pouch to the upper border of the tibia; openings are also made at the side and back of the joint so as to drain the posterior part of the cavity (see Fig. 47). These lateral and posterior incisions are best made by intro- ducing a pair of stout dressing forceps through the wound on each side of the patella, pushing them through the capsule and soft tissues, and cutting down on the closed blades. The forceps are piotruded through the openings in the skin, the l)lades are separated and the soft tissues forcibly separated to allow of the passage of a drainage tube. A large tube should be inserted on each side, one end emerging from the incision beside the patella and the other through the lateral opening ; besides these, tubes should be inserted through counter-openings at the posterior aspect of the joint. It is well also to pass a long tube trans- versely beneath the quadriceps tendon, and to make tlie ends emerge on each side from the incisions beside the patella. In the hip the joint should be opened by the anterior incision em- ployed for excision of the hip (see Fig. 35) ; a pair of stout dressing forceps may then be pushed through the posterior part of the capsule and made to protrude in the buttock where the lilades are cut down upon, and through the aperture thus made a tube may be pulled in so as to

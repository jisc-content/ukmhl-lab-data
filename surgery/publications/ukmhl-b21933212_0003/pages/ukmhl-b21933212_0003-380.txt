AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD 346 of the circle may be cut through before the rest. Unless special care is taken, the result will be that the dura mater is lacerated on that side, and even the brain may be injured. Therefore, the trephine should be removed from time to time after it has got well into the diploe, and the end of a flattened probe or a quill should be passed around the groove in order to ascertain whether the bone is nearly or entirely cut Fig. 149. â€” Trephines. A is the modern form in common use. The crown of the instrument is bevelled, and the pin is fixed to a solid metal block (a), which is kept in place by the pin (b), transfixing it and the crown. The handle is removed for cleaning purposes by unscrewing the nut (c). B shows a somewhat similar instrument worked as a centre-bit. The crown and the pin are similar to those in the other figure, but, as the machine is here intended for rapid work, it is fitted with a guard {d), which, by the agency of the screw (e), regulates the depth to which the crown is allowed to penetrate. This is most useful when several circles of bone have to be removed near one another. The thickness of the first circle being ascertained, the guard is set to that, and very rapid work can be done. through at any point. Should this be the case, the pressure must be made to bear on the thicker portions, and thus the skull can be cut through without injuring the dura mater. When the division of the circle is almost complete, the introduction of an elevator of suitable size will force out the circle of bone, which should be pushed under the scalp and kept there until the end of the operation. The depressed fragments of bone are then elevated, the internal table is examined, and any projecting portions are removed.

CHAPTER IV. DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW. The elbow-joint is frequently dislocated, and the accident commonly occurs before the age of sixteen. Dislocation may take place backwards, forwards, inwards, or outwards, and besides these typical forms, the bones of the forearm may also be displaced obliquely, the most frequent forms being dislocation backwards and inwards and dislocation back- wards and outwards. Either bone of the forearm may also be dislocated separately ; in this case the radius, if dislocated alone, may pass either backwards, outwards, or forwards; whilst if the ulna alone be displaced, it is dislocated backwards. DISLOCATION OF BOTH BONES OF THE FOREARM. In the majority of cases both bones are dislocated directly backwards, but in some cases an inward or an outward displacement may be com- bined with this. All the other forms of displacement, i.e. directly inwards, directly outwards or forwards, are very rare. DISLOCATION OF BOTH BONES BACKWARDS. As a rule this injury is caused by a fall upon the outstretched hand with the elbow fully extended. The result is that the anterior and lateral ligaments are ruptured and the coronoid process slips back over the lower end of the humerus. In some cases, however, fracture of the coronoid process occurs in addition. The head of the radius passes backwards along with the ulna, the radio-ulnar articulation being uninjured. The extent to which the bones are displaced backwards depends upon the damage done to the internal lateral ligament, the tendon of the brachialis anticus, or the coronoid process. Should these structures remain intact, the displacement is comparatively shght, as the coronoid process usually hitches against the lower end of the articular surface of .^7

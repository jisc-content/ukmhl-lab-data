DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP 55 TREATMENT OF THE REGULAR FORMS OF DISLOCATION. In all the regular dislocations, manipulations designed to cause the head of the femur to pass back into position along the path that it followed as it escaped from the joint should be tried. Reduction may be effected in this way, without the necessity for pulling on the exceedingly powerful muscles which surround the joint. A general anaesthetic should always be employed, although the bone may sometimes be replaced without one. Fig. 28.—Reduction of a Dorsal Dislocation of the Hip by Bigelow's Method. First Stage. The assistant steadies the pelvis and the surgeon flexes the affected limb to its utmost limit, and at the same time slightly adducts it and rotates it inwards so as to disengage the head of the bone. OF DISLOOATIONS BACKWARDS.—(a) Dislocation upon the Dorsum ilii.—When possible, the method of reduction by manipulation—called after Bigelow, who introduced it—should be attempted. Bigelow's Method.—The patient is laid flat on his back upon the floor or a low couch, and the surgeon, standing on the affected side, raises the thigh, and flexes it fully upon the abdomen, whilst an assistant fixes the pelvis (see Fig. 28). The knee should also be flexed to a right angle, and is useful in the later stages as a lever for rotating the

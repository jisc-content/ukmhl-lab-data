530 AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE palate are put in. The two sides of the uvula should now be brought together; here the stitches may be of horse-hair and can usually be passed directly from one half of the uvula to the other without employing the silk loop. The uvula is now grasped with forceps and pulled backwards and downwards so as to put the soft palate on the stretch ; this shows the surgeon exactly where the stitches should be introduced. The second soft palate stitch is put in midway between the uvula and the posterior edge of the hard palate, and then intermediate stitches are inserted at intervals of about a quarter of an inch. In the immediate neighbourhood of the uvula two or three stitches of horsehair may be passed direct from one flap to another without the intervention of the Fig. 256.—Needles for Staphvloraphy. loop. All the stitches should be inserted before any are tied, each pair being caught in Spencer Wells's forceps. The back of the throat is now sponged out, the line of incision gently cleared from blood- clot and mucus, and the stitches tied. In tying them, it is advisable to employ the surgical knot—that is to say, two turns should be taken in the first hitch so that it does not slip while the second half of the knot is being tied. The ends should be cut moderately long, so that the}^ may lie against the palate and not project directly on to the dorsum of the tongue. At this stage it is necessary that the patient should be deeply anasthetised so as to prevent retching or vomiting, and care must be taken to sponge away all mucus from the raw surfaces before the stitches are tightened. The relief of lateral tension.—The last step is to diminish the lateral

CHAPTER XV. NERVOUS AFFECTIONS OF JOINTS. AFFECTIONS DUE TO ORGANIC LESIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. In certain cases of disease or injury of the spinal cord or the main nerve trunks, peculiar and characteristic affections of the joints are met with, which are clearly the result of the nervous lesion. These affections are most commonly seen in locomotor ataxia, when the joint trouble receives the name of ' Charcot's Disease ' ; similar conditions are also met with in cases of sjningo-myelia. Joint affections have been noted in connection with other nervous lesions—such as hemiplegia and inflammation of the main nerve trunk supplying the articulation. In the latter cases the affection usually occurs in the smaller joints—such as the phalangeal or metacarpo-phalangeal joints—and consists of painful swelling of the joint followed by stiffness, and sometimes complete anchylosis, or by disorganisation of the articulation. Charcot's disease of joints. In locomotor ataxia the joints most frequently affected are those of the lower extremity, especially the knee and hip. The disease may be monarticular or may affect several joints, and generally occurs in the early stage of locomotor ataxia before the onset of the ataxic symptoms. In syringo-myelia the affection attacks the joints of the upper extremity much more frequently than those of the lower ; the shoulder is its most common seat. Pathological Changes.—Among the most striking features of Charcot's disease are the rapid atrophic changes which occur in the articular ends ; the cartilages disappear and the bone beneath often becomes so destroyed and altered in shape as to change the appearance of the joint entirely. In many cases there is subsequently a tendency to ^34

400 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD Ligature of the Internal Jugular Vein.—The incision for exposure of the internal jugular vein is similar to that for ligature of the common carotid artery above the omo-hyoid muscle (see Vol. 11. p. 193). The most convenient place for the ligature is opposite the bifurcation of the common carotid artery ; this point is easy of access and is almost always below the limits of the thrombus ; it is most essential that the ligature should be applied to a patent portion of the vein. If the vein is not patent it is often reddish and roughened on the surface, and does not collapse when it is lifted up on the aneurysm needle. A double Fig. 169.—Exposure of the Internal Jugular Vein, a, Platysma; 6, c, super- ficial layer of the deep cervical fascia; d, deep layer of the deep cervical fascia; e, lower end of the clot and inflamed vein; /, internal jugular vein; sterno-mastoid muscle; h, facial vein. ligature is passed and tied in two places ; the vein is then divided between the two ligatures, kny large tributaries exposed in the incision should also be tied. After the vein has been tied, the wound behind the ear is uncovered, and the groove in the bone around the lower part of the sinus packed with gauze to prevent clot from being forced on during the further manipulations. The sinus is now laid Iveely open, and the clot washed out with saline solution. When the clot extends down beyond the foramen lacerum medium, it is well to remove the packing from the groove, open the upper part of the ligatured jugular vein, and wash

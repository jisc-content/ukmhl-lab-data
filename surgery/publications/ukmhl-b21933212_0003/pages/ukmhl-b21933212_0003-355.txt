III. 321 Y DIVISION III. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD AND FACE. SECTION I.â€”AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD. CHAPTER XXIX. AFFECTIONS OF THE SCALP. Injuries to the head may be limited in their effects to the tissues outside the skull or, if more severe, may cause damage to the bone or the intra- cranial contents. The results vary with the situation of the injury, its severity and the cause producing it. In this chapter we deal only with the effects of injuries in so far as they concern the soft tissues overlying the bone. H^MATOMATA. Injuries to the scalp may produce either an open wound or a lesion of the deeper tissues without division of the skin. In the former case various kinds of scalp wounds result ; in the latter, htemorrhages in different situations, classed together under the name of haematomata. These haematomata may occur beneath the skin, beneath the tendon of the occipito-frontalis muscle or beneath the ])ericranium, the last form being often distinguished by the special name of cephal-hamatoma. THE SUBCUTANEOUS HEMATOMA. Haemorrhage beneath the skin presents no special points of importance. It does not differ in any material respect from bruises elsewhere, and its treatment is similar to that of an ordinary bruise.

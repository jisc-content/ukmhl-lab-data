DISEASES OF THE ANKLE-JOINT AND TAKSUS 225 have become quite firm. For some months the patient must wear a suitable boot provided with leg-irons to prevent lateral displacement (see Fig. go). In adults, arthrectomy performed in this manner, coml)ined with removal of the astragalus, is better than the ordinary excision, because it gives a good movable joint, whereas the latter leaves the articulation stiff ; nothing impedes locomotion more than a stiff ankle.

Wlun the astrasalus has been removed, the ends of the bones can readily be protruded through either of the lateral incisions. 3. When abscesses or sinuses are present, operation is gen- erally called for ; it is very seldom that treatment of the abscess without further operation will suffice. When, however, there is a single abscess it will be well to aspirate or wash out the abscess in the first instance ; then, if further operation becomes necessary, it will be less extensive and more satisfactory. If arthrectomy is performed while the abscess is still present, extra large incisions will be required, and it is very likely that tuberculous material will be left behind. Arthrectomy may be performed as soon as the abscess has healed or has diminished in size. III. Q

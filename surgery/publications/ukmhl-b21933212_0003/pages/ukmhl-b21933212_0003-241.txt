DISEASES OF THE KNEE-JOINT 207 removed and a silicate bandage or some similar immovable apparatus is applied. In most cases, especially when the crucial and lateral ligaments have been divided, it is best not to try to obtain a movable joint ; if movement be aimed at after arthrectomy, union of the ligaments and shortening of the capsule do not occur satisfactorily, and there is a marked tendency for the knee to become flexed.

The left-hand figure shows the powerful metal spring which acts as a strong extending force, and is useful when there is much flexion to be overcome. The right-hand figure shows the same splint arranged with elastic extension, and is most useful when there is only slight flexion to be overcome. in the after-treatment is this tendency to flexion, so that in a large number of cases it is advisable that the patient should wear a splint —either a Thomas's splint or a moulded leather splint—for months or even years. There is no doubt that the tendency to flexion is greater after arthrectomy than after excision, though in young subjects even the latter operation may be followed by the same trouble. When the ligaments have not been entirely destroyed in the operation, but have been stitched together afterwards, a Hessing's splint (see Fig. 81)

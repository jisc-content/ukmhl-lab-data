CHAPTER VII. III. 65 F DISLOCATIONS OF THE PATELLA. The accident may occur either from sudden violent contraction of the quadriceps or from a direct blow upon one edge of the bone. This dislocation is often associated with a lax condition of the ligaments, resulting from previous chronic synovitis with effusion, and is most common when genu valgum is present. VARIETIES.—The patella may be dislocated outwards or inwards, or it may be rotated vertically upon its long axis. Of these, dislocation outwards is far the most common, no doubt owing to the fact that the patella lies more over the external condyle than over the internal. This is still more marked when any degree of genu valgum is present; indeed, when the knock-knee is excessive, the patella is displaced outwards whenever the knee is fully flexed. DISLOCATION OF THE PATELLA OUTWARDS. In this dislocation the capsule is torn over the inner condyle and the patella slips over the external condyle, and therefore lies upon the outer side of the knee. The accident may occur whether the knee is flexed or extended ; when due to muscular action, it generally occurs with the knee bent. TREATMENT.—Reduction may generally be accomplished with- out employing an anaesthetic. The knee-joint is fully extended and the thigh flexed upon the pelvis, so as to relax the extensors of the thigh, and then comparatively shght manipulation will cause the bone to slip into position. After-treatment.—There is considerable synovial effusion as a result of the accident, and there may be some bleeding into the joint. The limb should be placed on a back splint, and cold—either in the form of an ice-bag or Leiter's tubes (see Vol. I. p. lo)—should be applied im- mediately after reduction. When the effusion has become stationary, its absorption may be aided by massage, and firm support should be afforded by a bandage applied outside a mass of cotton-wool.

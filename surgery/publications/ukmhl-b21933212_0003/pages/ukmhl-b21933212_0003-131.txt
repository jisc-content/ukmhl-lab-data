ACUTE INFLAMMATION 97 no longer emerge through tlie anterior opening, while those which pass across the joint may be cut in two so that there is a tube on each side, and these should be gradually shortened. The drainage tube in the most dependent situation should be removed last. No attempt should be made to save the limb when the general condition oi the patient is bad, or when there is spreading osteo- myelitis or general septic infection, as indicated by asthenic fever, rigors, and hectic temperature. Radical measures also become necessary in most cases when the bones become denuded of periosteum, when the pain is intense, and when abscesses form around the joint. In these cases amputation through the shaft of the proximal bone, should this be healthy, or through the articulation above, should there be osteo-myelitis, is usually necessary. When amputation is performed through the shaft of one of the affected bones, care must be taken to go well above the joint, and the medulla at the point of division of the bones should be examined in order to make sure that osteo-myelitis is absent. Should pus be found in the medulla, a second amputation must be done higher up, or should the first amputation have been performed near the upper end of the bone, the latter should be disarticulated. Some surgeons advocate excision in these cases, but in our opinion the operation is rarely justifiable for reasons that we have given on p. 86. When arthritis affects joints that cannot he removed by means of an amputation—as for example, the sterno-clavicular or the temporo- maxillary joints—the only alternative to simple drainage is excision III.

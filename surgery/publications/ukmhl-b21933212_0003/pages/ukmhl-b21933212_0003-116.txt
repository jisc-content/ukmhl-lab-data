CHAPTER XI. 82 WOUNDS OF JOINTS. In speaking of wounds of joints, we shall confine ourselves to wounds which actually penetrate the articulation—a condition recognised in most cases by the escape of synovial fluid or, when the wound is of large size, by actual inspection. Non-penetrating wounds of joints are not, strictly speaking, wounds of the articulation at all, their only importance being that they may be accompanied by sepsis, which may ultimately lead to suppuration within the joint. VARIETIES.—Wounds of joints may be divided into punctured wounds, and large wounds which freely expose the interior ; the latter may be subdivided according as they are clean-cut or contused. The subsequent course may differ in each case. In a punctured woimd there is often no introduction of septic material into the joint cavity ; in the other forms, especially in contused wounds, septic contamination of the joint will almost certainly occur. Distinction should also be made between wounds that are quite recent and those in which some hours have elapsed since their infliction. The importance of this lies in the fact that, in the former group, micro- organisms that have gained access to the joint will not have had time to multiply and become diffused throughout the joint and the surrounding tissues before the surgeon sees the case, whereas in the latter this will have taken place. TREATMENT OF RECENT WOUNDS. PUNCTURED WOUNDS.—It is generally safe in these cases to regard the articular cavity as free from infection; punctured wounds are inflicted by a slender pointed instrument, and the probability is that any organisms present upon it will be removed during its passage through the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This is a point of great practical importance, because it will not be necessary to open up the

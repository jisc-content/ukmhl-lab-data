CHAPTER XVIII. 152 ANCHYLOSIS. True anchylosis implies absolute rigidity of the joint, and is usually due to actual osseous union between the bones ; but, from the practical point of view, it is well to include under this term other less extensive inter- ferences with movement. Anchylosis may therefore be described under four heads : (i) osseous union between the ends of the bones ; (2) partial or complete obliteration of the synovial cavity by fibrous adhesions ; (3) contraction and rigidity of the peri-articular tissues ; (4) adhesion of muscles to the bones in the vicinity of the joint. In the treatment of the affection, we have also to consider whether the position of the limb is good or bad. BONY UNION BETWEEN THE ARTICULAR SURFACES. Before bony anchylosis can occur, the articular cartilage must have been completely destroyed. TREATMENT.â€”The only circumstances under which the surgeon is called upon to interfere, in cases of true bony anchylosis, are: when there is much pain, when there is deformity of the limb from faulty position, and when the patient desires to obtain a movable joint in place of a stiff one. When the joint is in good position and free from pain, and when a movable joint is not required, it is unnecessary to employ any treatment. Painful bony anchylosis is comparati\'ely rare, but it may be met with when anchylosis accompanies a still active osteitis of the articular ends ; in some cases there may be an abscess in the end of the bone. Under these circumstances it will be necessary to cut down upon the thickened and painful bone, gouge a hole in it, and seek for an abscess as recommended for osteitis and abscess of bone (see Vol. II.). This pro- cedure usually relieves the pain completely, even though pus is not found. In bo7iy anchylosis accompanied by deformity the condition cannot

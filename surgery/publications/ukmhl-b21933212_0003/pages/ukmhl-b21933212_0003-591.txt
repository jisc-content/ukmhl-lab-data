NEW GROWTHS OF THE PAROTID GLAND THE ' PAROTID TUMOUR.' The so-called ' parotid tumour' often consists of a mixture of tissues generally containing a good deal of cartilage, patches of myxo- matous tissue interspersed with a certain amount of fibrous tissue, various glandular elements, and sometimes tissue histologically resembling sarcoma. Most of these tumours probably belong to the group of the endotheliomata, but their exact place in pathology is not definitely settled. As a nile, these tumours are firm in consistence, irregular in Fig. 271.—Incision for the Removal of a ' Parotid Tumour.' outline and encapsuled. They often grow very slowly ; the simple forms do not affect the lymphatic glands, and a cure results if the whole growth and its capsule are removed. As the tumours enlarge, they may become displaced downwards by their weight, and indeed in some cases they may pass so far downwards that their connection with the parotid gland is not recognised. TREATMENT.—Wlien the tumour is small, it can be readily removed by an incision over it parallel to the branches of the facial nerve. When the capsule is reached, the tumour is enucleated, and if in doing so any portion of it is broken off, this must be taken away after the main mass has been dealt with. Care must be taken to keep close to the tumour so as to avoid damaging the branches of the facial nerve. The scar is very slight.

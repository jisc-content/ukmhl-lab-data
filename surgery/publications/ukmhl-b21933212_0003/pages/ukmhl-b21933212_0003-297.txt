263 DIVISION II. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SPINE. CHAPTER XXV. INJURIES OF THE SPINE. Injuries of the spine are of common occurrence and vary in gravity according to the severity of the violence producing them. The most common cause of severe injuries of tlie spine is sudden ex- treme flexion of the spinal column, such as occurs in hunting or bicycle accidents, in which the patient falls upon the head or shoulders, and the spine is forcibly bent. Damage may also be caused by sudden twisting or over-extension of the spine, as contrasted with over-flexion, and also from very powerful muscular action. Direct violence, such as a blow on the back driving the upper part of the spine forward, while the lower remains stationary, is a very important cause of serious injury; for example, masses of earth, or heavy bags, falling on the upper part of the spine are veiy apt to cause a fracture-dislocation at a lower level. Other causes of spinal injury are jars and concussions, such as occur in railway accidents, and falls from a height upon the back, the feet, or the buttocks. The results of these injuries vary very greatly in degree according to their severity, the position of the patient at the time of the accident, and the strength of the muscles and ligaments concerned. I. The mildest form of injury is a sprain of the spinal muscles and ligaments, resulting in severe cases in more or less complete rupture ; these lesions usually follow violent flexion or rotation of the spine.

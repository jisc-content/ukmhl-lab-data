CATAREH OF THE BLADDEE. Man, aged forty-five. States that he has to pass water every hour, and has on several occasions passed blood. No pain at point of the penis, no history of renal colic. The water shows considerable sedunent of what appear to be mucus and pus; there is a history of exposure to cold and shivering two months ago. All this points to a catari'h or cold in the bladder, and it is not likely that any calculus will be present here, although I

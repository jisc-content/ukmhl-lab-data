STRUMOUS GLANDS 13 sary the next day to have chloroform, and the gland sores would be put right. The girl returned, had chloroform, the operation was performed, and in a week the neck looked healthy, and in another week was healed; the dressing used being iodoform with sal-alembroth gauze for the first week, an ointment with ten grains of boracic acid to the ounce of vaseline being used during the second week.

A natural fold in the skin conceals a cicatrix. A piece of silver wire, as a drain, is often sufficient where the suppura- tion is not severe, and the mark left is very slight.

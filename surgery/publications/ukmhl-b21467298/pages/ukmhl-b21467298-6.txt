6 SURGICAL NOTES. message, is more satisfactory to the medical man, and avoids much of the discomfort which is occasioned by patients report- ing what the Doctor at the Infirmary said. Those of you who are not so much occupied as most students are, will find it an advantage to take notes of the cases, and the remarks made about them; and at the end of the session you will give me these note-books, and to the best I will give a prize, as I have done for the last few years. We begin the hour by seeing those cases who are here for the first time; and to enable you to see as many as possible, we are assisted by a senior student. This winter Mr Campbell has kindly agreed to do so. He sees that the patients are ready with dressings, and clothes removed where that is necessary, and he also examines the cases treated formerly here, so that only those of importance are seen every day. I may sometimes ask you to visit patients at their own homes, which is one department in Glasgow not sufiiciently developed, although within the last year there is greater opportunity for visiting work since Professors Cleland and Charteris took the matter up, and I would advise you all to avail yourselves of this. Following the good example of Professor Charcot, of Paris, and Dr Byrom Bramwell, of Edinburgh, in their Studies in Clinical Medicine, recently published, I intend to place in your hands " Surgical Notes;" and although I cannot attempt to go into the detail at present which the two distinguished Physicians I have mentioned have done, I hope that you may find it of service in the future to be able to refer to these Notes.

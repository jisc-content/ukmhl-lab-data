8 SURGICAL NOTES. a tablespoonful of Epsom salts in half a tumblerful of hot water, to be drunk every second or third morning. In forty-eight hours, if the swelling and pain are unrelieved, you must incise the testicle, which will relieve the tension, and very rapidly the swelling will disappear. Sometimes orchitis, in weakly people, is very acute, and where they have been drinking too freely, the tissues may show a tendency to sloughing, and then you must incise early. Mr Henry Smith used to advise puncturing in all cases of orchitis. This treatment gives marked relief to swelling and pain, but seems best suited for severe cases. SCALP WOUND. Man, aged thirty, with scalp wound, from a blow with the tongs two nights ago. A bruised irregular wound exists on the top of the head. First examine with the finger as to the state of the bone. No evidence of any fracture. When you can use your finger, it gives more information than a probe, and will do less harm. Shave the hair for half an inch round the edges of the wound, thoroughly cleanse the parts with antiseptic lotion. Wliere the wound is ragged and recent, pare the edges before stitching, and do so carefully; if not recent, the wound is best unstitched. Apply carefully antiseptic dressing, and, when possible, keep the patient at rest for three days, until all danger of any u-ritation is gone. Injuries to scalp are very liable to become affected with erysipelas, so be specially careful in your dressings of them. The dressing generally used in the Dispensary, is a pad of wood- wool wadding, with a piece of Gamgee's tissue above it. You may dust a little iodoform over the part first, to secure greater dryness of the wound, along with increased antiseptic protec- tion. When you have seen the wound shortly after infliction, and thoroughly carried out the above di'essing, you should not change it for a week, unless there is pain or fever. At the end

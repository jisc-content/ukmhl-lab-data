15 ENLARGED PROSTATE. Sometimes an ordinary truss is not sufficient to keep the hernia up, and it becomes necessary to perform one of the many operations devised for this deformity. This should not be too long delayed, for the opening in the abdomen increases in size if the hernia is not attended to. Umbilical herniae occur very frequently in private practice. They are generally of small size, but sometimes in weakly children are as big as a bantam's egg. The simplest treatment is a pad over the protrusion, kept in position by Leslie's tape plaster. A halfcrown stitched into chamois leather, and applied to the umbilicus with six inches of plaster, has given me better results than any other truss. It must be a halfcrown, or a flat thin piece of cork; a penny causes irritation at once, and this irritation led on one occasion to my discovering, that my order as to the pad being a halfcrown had been neglected. In very small umbilical herniee, Professor Lund's plan with two slips of plaster is useful. Draw the umbilical opening close, and apply one slip horizontally and another vertically, and this will very soon obliterate the protrusion. In order to prevent the occurrence of umbilical hernia, the cord should be tied carefully, and, after it separates, a firm pad of lint should be kept over it to ensure proper puckering of the structures, and a firm navel as a result.

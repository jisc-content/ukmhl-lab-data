7 ACUTE OBGHITIS. There is inflammation of the fascia in the palm, which must be incised, the fingers extended; corrosive sublimate lotion, 1 to 2000, applied to the wound with Gamgee's tissue wrung out of hot water placed round hand and fingers, with dry tissue above, and the hand placed on a splint. This was done by a student, and the man expressed himself as relieved. The patient will return in two days, and the dressing will be changed. When a rusty nail, or indeed any foreign body, makes a wound, the first treatment should be, thorough cleansing of the wound (enlarging it first if necessary) by an antiseptic lotion, then the application of an antiseptic dressing, and last, but not least, the placing of the part injured at rest. Eest is the best anti- septic, the best surgical dressing you have; without it, so called antiseptics are of little avail. Always ask yourself the ques- tion. How shall I put this injured part at rest ? You will see many illustrations here, more especially in injuries to joints, of the great value of rest, and of the serious consequences of the want of it. ACUTE ORCHITIS. Man, aged sixty-five : swollen testicle of three days' duration. It is red, painful, and tender, with no impulse on coughing, and patient states that he has used the catheter for a year, owing to difficulty in making his water—due to enlarged prostate, a very frequent occurrence at his time of life. It is by no means uncommon to find orcliitis resulting from the passage of a catheter, and this should be remembered. Gonorrhoea, or an injury, are the more frequent causes, as you will have occasion to see. The treatment consists in the patient keeping in bed, and each night applying hot fomenta- tions over the swelling—a tablespoonful of laudanum added to the boiling water used to make the fomentation soothe the pain. In the morning, paint the swelling with flexible collodion. Order

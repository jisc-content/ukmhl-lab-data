Their ■ mouths on close inspection appear shut, with their ends form- ing an obtuse point; and this happens more frequently in very muscular subjects, where the operation has been very dexterously performed. Now should y^m pass over these arteries without securuig them, you will find that within six hours of the patient having been returned to bed, by the

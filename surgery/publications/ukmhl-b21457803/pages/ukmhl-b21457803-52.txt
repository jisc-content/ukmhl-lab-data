Ossific union hardly ever takes place. It will be right, however, to keep the arm steadily in the bent position for three weeks after the injury, and thus to make the liga" mentous union as short as possible, by leaving the bone n?r fectly at rest."_5fir A.

The injury is readily recognized : there is inability to extend the fore-arm by its own muscular power, a consi- derable space is felt between the separated portions of the bone and the upper fragment is moveable as well as de- tached. These marks of the injury are rendered more conspi- cuous by bending the joint. Crepitation is produced by moving the limb when extended, and the separated parts thereby approximated. Bloody swelling soon takes place large and extensive when bruising of the soft parts has been great; and this is usually the case, in consequence of the injury being almost always the result of direct violence. In some cases the process is commimited."—Elements of Surgery. What steps ought to be taken with the view of uniting the fracture by ossific matter ? 108/. Having reduced the tumefaction imniediatelv con- sequent upon the injury, by means of leeches and cold lotions, a bandage is to be applied; and in those cases, where but little swelling has been produced, the limb should be secured by a bandage at once. " The principle of treatment is to preserve the power of the limb, by making the separation of

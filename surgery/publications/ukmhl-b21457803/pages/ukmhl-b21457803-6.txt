For these reasons, the Author feels assured that he shall receive the approbation rather than the censure of his readers for the course which he has pursued ; and if such a course shall in any wise benefit his fellow-men, who, from severe acci- dents, may stand in need of the treatment recommended in this work, the object of its publication will be accomplished.

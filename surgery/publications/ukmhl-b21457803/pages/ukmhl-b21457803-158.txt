14(i afterwards usefuland tliis prevention is best effected by the splints with foot-pieces above mentioned.—Ibid. Var. 2.—Dislocatio astragali. Dislocation of the astragalus. Under lohat circumstances is the astragalus generally dislo- cated, and what are the appearances of this dislocation ? 1484. This bone, from its strong- ligamentous connexions, is very seldom found dislocated; and when its displacement is effected, it is usually accompanied with fracture of the sur- rounding bones: this accident occasions much deformity, and the appearances must altogether depend on the direction in which the bone is thrown out of its natural situation. What is the best method of reducing the dislocation of this bone ? 1485. This dislocation is a most serious injury, and is re- duced with no small difficulty. If common extension should not succeed, " the use of pulleys will be required, and the action of the muscles should be lessened by tartarized anti- mony." If the reduction cannot be effected, lameness must result. Var. 3.—Dislocatio ossium navicularis et cuboidis. Disloca- tion of the navicular and cuboid bones. WTiat are the appearances of this varietij of dislocation ? 1486. The five anterior bones are sometimes dislocated at the transverse joint between the astragalus and os calcis, and the naviculare and cuboides. In this case the astragalus and OS calcis remain in their normal positions, whilst the fore part of the foot is turned inwards upon the bones. The ap- pearance of this luxation is, according to Sir A. Cooper, that of a club-foot; so much so, indeed, thatinone instance, adduced by him, the appearance of the foot was more like a natural defect than an accidental displacement.—Treatise on Dislo- In what manner ought this luxation to be reduced ? 1487. Extension is to be made by fixing the leg and heel, and then the fore part of the foot is to be drawn outwards, by which the reduction will commonly be effected.—

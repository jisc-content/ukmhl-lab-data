What are the characteristic marks of a fracture of the con- dyles of the femur into the joint ? • 1384. This case will be known by swellmg of the joint and by crepitation upon moving the joint generally, and by the moveableness of the condyle suspected to be fractured. What mode of treatment is required for a fracture of this kind? 1 1 u u 1 1385. " Whether the external or internal condyle be broken the same treatment is required. The limb is to be placed upon a pillow in the straight position, and evaporatmg lotions and leeches are to be used to subdue the swellmg and inflam- mation. When this object has been effected, a roller is to be applied around the knee, and a piece of stiff pasteboard, about sixteen inches long, and sufficiently wide lo extend entirely under the joint, and to pass on each side of it, so as to reach to the end of the patella, is to be dipped in warm water, ap- plied under the knee, and confined by a roller. When this is dry, it will have exactly adapted itself to the form of the joint, and this form it will afterwards retain, so as best to confine the bones."—Sir A. Cooper's Treatise on Dislocations, 8^c, Whtj do you prefer the straight position in this fracture ? 1386. "Because the tibia presses the extremity of the broken condyle into a line with that which is not injured."— Ibid. In what directions is the patella most commonly fractured? 1387. The patella is most commonly fractured transversely; but sometimes, though unfrequently, in a longitudinal direction. WJiat is the immediate effect upon the patella after the occur- rence of this accident ? 1388. The upper portion of the bone is immediately drawn up, and separated from the lower, by the action of the rectus femoris, cruralis, and vasti muscles, leaving an interspace of " from half an inch to five inchesthe length of that space

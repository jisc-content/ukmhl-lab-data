It extends from the posterior and ui- ferior part Sf the os calcis to the tuberosity on the mfenor suiface of the cuboid bone, and also to the extremitjes of the metatarsal bones of the little toe and toe next to it. Both Siese sets of fibres have the same attachments, and are sepa- rated bv a layer of fat.—Fic^e ibid. . What ligaments hold the articulation of the os naviculare with the OS cuboides ? . ^ n k„ f„r/x 1461 "These two bones are connected together by two strong ligaments; one being situated on the dorsal region of the foot, and the other on the plantar. —Ibid. By ivhat ligaments are the cuboid bone and the os navicular e connected with the cuneiform bones . 1462 These bones are respectively held by a tloisai anc plantar ligament; the former being situated on the back, and the latter on the sole of the foot. , , , p By what bones is the tarsus articulated with the metatarsus ^ 1463. By the three cuneiform bones, and os cuboides pos- teriorly, and by the bases of the five metacarpal bones ante- riorly ; the three first of which are opposed to the cuneiform, and the two last to the cuboid. State the ligaments which maintain the metatarsal bones in articulation with the tarsus. . . . ^ . i 1464 These bones are maintained in position by nve dorsal ligaments above, and five plantar below, which pass from the three cuneiform bones and the cuboid to the ends of the meta- tarsal bones, both above and below precisely in the same manner.

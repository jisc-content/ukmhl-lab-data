Its form is that of a triangle, the apex of which is attached to the thigh-bone, and its base, which is bifurcated, forms two flattened bands, which pass around the circumference of the foramen produced by the cotyloid ligament, passing over the notch of the acetabulum. ~~^wtat is the nature and situation of the cotyloid ligament ? 1210 " The circumference of the cotyloid cavity is sur- rounded by this fibro-ligamentous substance, which renders it perfectly regular, and forms into a foramen the notch, which is situated in the under and fore part of that cavity, Icavnig a

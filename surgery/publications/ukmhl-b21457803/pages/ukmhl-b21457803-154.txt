142 By what ligaments are the metatarsal hones connected with each other ? 1465. " All the bones of the metatarsus, excepting the first, are in contact with one another at their superior extremities, and present small articular surfaces, which are covered with synovial membrane, and maintained in their respective posi- tions by dorsal and plantar ligaments, of which there are three on each region, passing transversely from one bone to the other, excepting from the first to the second."—i?. Cooper's Treatise on the Ligaments. They are all also connected by interosseous ligaments. The anterior extremities of the metatarsal bones are con- nected by a transverse ligament, precisely in the same manner as the posterior. Genus 1.—Dislocatio. Dislocation. Speotes 1.—Dislocatio simplex malleolaris. Simple luxation of the ankle-joint. Var. 1.—lAixatio tibice. Dislocation of the tibia. In what directions may dislocation of the tibia take place ? 1466. The tibia may be dislocated inwards, forwards, and outwards. It is said to be sometimes also dislocated back- wards. " The foot has also been known to be thrown up- wards between the tibia and fibula, by the giving way of the ligament which unites these bones; but this accident is only an aggravated state of the internal dislocation."—Sir A. Cooper's Treatise on Dislocations. What are the signs of a dislocation of the tibia inwards ? 1467. In this case, the internal malleolus is thrown off the astragalus inwards, and stretches the integuments : the foot is thrown outwards, and its inner edge rests upon the ground," whilst, about three inches above the outer ankle, there will be a considerable indentation. To these appearances will be added much tumefaction.—libid. What is the cause of the indentation of the fibula a little above the outer ankle ? 1468. A fracture of that bone, which usually results from this kind of luxation; and when the fibula is thus fractured, which may be inferred by the depression, and proved by ere-

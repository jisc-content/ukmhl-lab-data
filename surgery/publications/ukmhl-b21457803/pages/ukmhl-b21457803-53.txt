Togo -The radius may be broken at the upper part near its head, and at its middle, but most frequently near the distal extremity."—I/W^ow's Elements. , ,• j " The ulna is usually broken by force directly applied, as when the arm is brought in contact with hard bodies m fells By direct violence also both bones may give way about the middle, and at corresponding points; or, when force is applied in the direction of the bones, the ulna may be found broken near the wrist, and the radius near the elbow. —Ibid. bI what signs might fracture of either or both of these bones he detected? . . • ju 1091 " The existence of fracture is ascertained by tidcmg the bones with the fingers, and by gently rotating the limb ; the broken portions moving on each other produce distinct crepitation. When the radius is broken near its centre, the

Cooper, by Tyrrell. Describe the mode of reducing compound dislocations of the ankle, and the subsequent local treatment. 1495 " The reduction of the dislocation is to be accom- plished by the same means as already described in the simple displacements, vide 1470 ; and when reduced, the edges of the wound are to be very carefully approximated by sutures and strips of adhesive plaister, over which, a piece of lint, dipped in the patient's blood, is to be placed ; this, when the blood coagulates, forms, as far as I have seen, the best covering for the wound. The part is to be farther supported by the applica- tion of separate pieces of linen, in the same way as by the many- tailed bandage, but each portion being unconnected with the others, so that any one piece can be removed, and another substituted for it, by tacking the old and new strips together before the former is drawn from its situation ; in this way the limb is not disturbed by the change.- This bandage is to be moistened bv an evaporating lotion ; the padded splints are lastly to be employed with foot-pieces, as recommended in the simple dislocation; but a portion of that one situated on the wounded side of the limb should be cut out, in order to enable the surgeon to dress the wound without removing the splint. The position in which the extremity should be placed is the same as in the simple injury, but must be occa- sionally varied a little according to the seat and extent of the wound."—Ibid. Are there not cases of compound dislocation of the ankle-joint^ in which it might be advisable to saw off the projecting end of the tibia before we attempt to reduce the bones

PRACTICAL EXAMINATIONS, Class IX.—5r«c/wa?ia.—Emergencies occurring to the upper extremities. Order I.— Claviculo-scapularia. Claviculo-scapular. Genus I.—Bislocatio. Dislocation. Species T.—Bislocatio clavicuke. Dislocation of the clavicle. State the displacements that may occur to the articulations of the clavicle. 942. This bone may be dislocated either at the sternal or scapular extremity ; but the latter is by far the most common occurrence. What are the ligaments that confine the sternal end of the clavicle in its natural position ? 943. The interclavicular fixes the end of the hone to the opposite clavicle and to the sternum, to which it is also attached by the capsular ligament with its interarticular cartilage. Its inferior sternal edge is also fixed to the cartilage of the first rib by the rhomboid ligament. In what directions may the hone be displaced from its sternal attachment ? 944. Forwards upon the sternum, and backwards behind it. What are the diagnostic marks of the former ? 945. An unnatural projection on the upper part of the sternum, into which the clavicle can be traced, and which disappears when the shoulders are drawn backwards ; pain on moving the dislocated bone, and a diminution of the space between the point of the shoulder and sternum j indeed, in thin persons the nature of the accident is ascertained at one glance.

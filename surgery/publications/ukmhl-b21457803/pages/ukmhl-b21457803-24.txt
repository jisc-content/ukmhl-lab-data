14 resistance is greater ; but as soon as the bone is felt to move from its situation, the surgeon should give the strings of the pulley to an assistant, and, putting his knee or lieel against the head of the bone, at the fore part of the shoulder, should push it back towards the glenoid cavity : but this step is not of the smallest utility until the bone has been drawn below the level of the coracoid process; and whilst the surgeon is thus pressing the head of the bone backwards, he should pull the arm forwards from the elbow. This is the plan which 1 have found by far the most effectual in reducing the dislocation for- wards."—/Sir Astley Cooper s Treatise, ^c. Var. 3.—Dislocatio super dorsum scapula.

What are the signs that distinguish this species of displace- "^^994 The projection of the acromion, the flattening of the deltoid muscle, and the direction of the shaft of the humerus backwards towards a protuberance upon the dorsum scapula, occasioned by the head of the displaced bone.

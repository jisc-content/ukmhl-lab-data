71 than to open the joint.

Cooper, by Tyrrell. State the method of removing either the fore or little fingers, according to this practice. 1199. " In amputating either the fore or little finger, only two external incisions are required, which should begin at a point below the extremity of the metacarpal bone, as in the other case, only over the centre of that side which is outer- most, and extend one over the joint and the other under it in an oblique direction, so as to meet between the fingers ; two flaps are then to be raised, so as to expose the extremity of the metacarpal bone, the separation of which is to be com- pleted as before described."—Ibid. The vessels are to be se- cured by pressure or ligature. What is the best method of amputating the phalanges at their penultimate joints ? 1200. " The finger being extended, the integument is cut through by a circular incision about half an inch beyond the joint, and a lateral incision is to be made on each side, in the direction of the lateral ligaments, extending from over the joint to the circular cut; the portions of integument are to be raised from the flexor and extensor tendons, below and above,

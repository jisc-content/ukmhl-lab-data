72 as far as the joint, making two flaps; after which, the tendons and one of the lateral ligaments are to be divided, when the joint may be easily dislocated, and separation of the part readily accomplished."—Ibid. But is it practicable always to accomplish the operation in this way ? 1201. External injuries will seldom allow us to act accord- ing to set rules. We may have to form the flap from the back, side, or front of the finger, as may best answer the purpose of covering the stump. What is the most expeditious mode of amputating the ultimate joint of the phalanx ? 1202. The following method of Sir A. Cooper's will be the most expeditious and the best:— A single flap is to be made from the palmar part. " In doing this, the joint must be flexed, when the scalpel is car- ried through the integuments on the dorsum of the joint, and through the joint itself, dividing the ligaments at one cut; the knife is then passed under the phalanx, which is to be ampu- tated, and a flap of suflScient extent is separated from the palmar side." Should the fracture be confined to the joint itself, would you remove the finger at the next joint, or divide the body of the bone close to the injured articulation ? 1203. The phalanx should be removed at the latter point, and by the method recommended at 1200. By ivhat means v ould you check the bleeding of the digital ar- teries after the operation ? 1204. A ligature will seldom be necessary. The pressure from the dressings will usually suffice. Class X.— Cruralia.—Emergencies occurring to the lower extremities. Order I.—Femoralia. Femoral.

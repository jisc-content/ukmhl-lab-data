When this vessel is to be secured, it is desirable to make the â– yicisiou as high as you can ; the upper boundary, therefore, will be the angle of the jaw, and belovv the omo-hyoideus ; make your incision first, then high up, on the inner side of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus ; upon drawing aside the edge of which you will distinctly see the omo-hyoideus obliquely- crossing the artery. (Sir Astley here exhibited it in the dead body.) I have laid bare the carotid, and will now show you what you must principally take care to avoid in this operation, viz., the par-vagum, which accompanies the artery; if you were to tie this nerve you would endanger life ; well then, when you are about to pass the ligature round the vessel, if you raise it a little, you can readily discover whether the nerve be in contact with it, and thus guard against an accident which might lead to a fatal result. I will now conclude the lecture by saying a few words on aneurisms from arteries of the scalp, d'he first case of this kind that I saw was sent to me by Mr. Toulmiu, of Hackney: in this instance I tied the artery proceeding to, and from, tire tumour. If the aneuri.smal bag be not very large, you may cut immediately across it; apply a piece of doubled lint, then ad- hesive plaster, and over the whole a roller. If the .swelling is small, that is, not larger than a walnut, adopl another mode, which is to make a circular incision completely down to the oCcipito-frontalis tendon. In this manner the connexion be- tween the blood-vessels and the aneurism is destroyed ; and, by applying a dossil of lint and strips of adliesive plaster, you speedily succeed in getting rid of the disease. I saw a case of aneurism of the posterior aural artery, and, for its cure, tied all the vessels which were leading to and from it. 1 should have done better, by making, round the tumour, the circular incision that I have Just dc.scribcd. J.ECJ'L JIE XXIIL On Hydrocele. Hydrocele is an accumulation of water in the tunica vagi- nali.s testis ; the anatomy, theielore, of those per.sons who say that the fluid is contained iretween the tunica idlniginca and the tunica vaginalis is exceedingly faulty. Such a description IS entirely false ; and 1 searcelv need tell gentlemen, that N 2

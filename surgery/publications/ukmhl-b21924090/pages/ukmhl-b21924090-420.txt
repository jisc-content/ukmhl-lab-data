404 ON THE DIFFERENT AMPUTATIONS. requires, I think, that the remainder of the bone should be divided by the saw, for if this he not done, the long continued excitement may wear out the powers of the constitution. Diseased joints used veiy frequently to lead to the perform- ance of amputation in young persons as well as in the old ; but amputation is much less frequently performed at the pre- sent day, ill consequence of such disease, than some years back ; even diseases of the joints of the upper extremities of children give rise to amputation much less frequently than in the days of our fore-fathers, but in chronic disea,ses of the ankle and knee, amputation is still very commonly performed ; there is, however, a marked distinction in these chronic en- largements; one variety may be called congenital, which exists from the birth of the child, and the other is from some debi- litating cause which produces the complaint afterbirth; as the constitution, therefore, is radically weak or vitiated in the former of these affections, you cannot expect that such per- manent benefit will result in that case, as in the latter, where the constitution becomes affected from some accidental cir- cumstance. With respect to diseases of the ankle and knee joints, am - putation for such complaints will occasionally be necessary both of the leg and thigh ; indeed, chronic affections of the ankle and knee give rise to amputation as frequently as dis- eases in any part of the body. For compound fractures we seldom amputate directly ; they are seldom so severe as to require immediate amputation, and it is not until gangrene or disease of the bone has taken place, that it is deemed neces- sary to amputate; compound fractures, however, from the superior manner in which they are now treated, do much better than formerly, and very severe injuries of this descrip- tion will often terminate most favourably ; therefore, upon the whole, amputations are much less frequently performed at the present epoch than in the days of our ancestors. Now, gentlemen, before you amputate, it is necessary that you should apply, in such situations where it can be accomplished, the tourniquet, an instniment which consists of a strong hand, capable of cou7pletelv surrounding the thigh, two brass bridges, a long screw, a pad, and two small rollers. The rollers are situated one at each end of the tinder bridge. 'I'he bridges lie in immediate contact with each other, the concave part of the upper bridge completely fitting the convex surface of the under. The pad is placed in the arch of the under bridge, and which pad is to be placed immediately upon the vessel whose circu- lation i.s to be stopped ; after having thus applied the pad, you are to bring the band around the limb, and secure it tightly

127 ON FRACTURES OF THE SKULL. you must deplete only, and not dream of performing the ope- ration ; to do it under such circumstances would be highly absurd, and the height of ma»iness. On Fuactukes of the Skull. Fracture.s of the skull are not of themselves dangerous, nor are they injurious to the brain ; therefore these fractures do not call for any alarm, if care be taken to prevent the inflam- mation ; the danger in these cases is to be apprehended from disturbance in some distant part, irritation of the system, or extravasation ; it is not then, I repeat, from the fracture itself that the danger is to be aiiprehended, but from compression of the brain, extravasation of blood, or irritation in some distant part; therefore, when called to a case of fracture of the skull, you do not operate, but con.sider the symptoms that are present, endeavour to ascertain from what they arise, and then regulate your treatment accordingly ; if the symptoms are those of concussion, the treatment must be directed to it; if those of extravasation of blood, and there is not much ex- citement, it will, be necessary to remove a portion of bone ; but if tliere be fracture only, without any of the symptoms above mentioned, there will be no occasion to operate. When a fracture occurs at the base of the skull, it is much more dangerous than at any other part, because extravasation is much more likely to take place, or if not, inflammation of the brain, from the violence of the injury received, very often supervenes. The mode in which these fractures are produced, is by falling from a great height on the summit of the head ; when all the weight ot the body rests on the foramen mag- num, and cuneiform process of the us occipitis, great injury i.s in this way done ; as in very many cases a transverse fracture through the foramen magnum, cuneiform process, and part of the temporal bone is the consequence ; a discharge of blood into each meatus auditorius takes jflace, and whei e there is no I'ther miscliief, deafness often remains for life. A curious frac- ture within the orbit sometimes occurs, as in the ease from which this specimen (pointing to one on the table) was taken, when destruction of life was the consc(|uence of the injury received. I will give you the history of the case ; A child was playing witli a scissors, when the point of it enteicd the ui)per jjart of the orbit, between the ball of the eye and the su|ierior eye-lid ; the scissors was with dilliculty extracted ; the child’s eye did not become inflamed ; after the accident the child walked from L Garden, who attended it; on the 10th day Irotn the time ot the mischief, sympt(tms of coni- pre'Sion of the brain came on, rigors, inflammation of the biain supervened, and the child died ; on examining the

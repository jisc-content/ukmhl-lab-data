190 ON THE CURE OF HYDROCELE. ter to escape, but it was soon found tliat this was not sufficient to effect a cure, and it was then recommended, that after the incision had been made, a portion of the tunica vayinalif should be cut out : but this operation is followed by high constitutional irritation; it is true that it sometimes effects a cure by preventing the return of the hydrocele, but it also doe* it by killing the patient; in fact, the very last time that I saw this operation performed, a violent inflammation and slough- ing of the scrotum ensued 5 why, gentlemen, any one rather than undergo such an operation, would submit to have a hy- drocele all his life ; the mode of relief is too cruel for so tri- fling an inconvenience. The next mode is that of introducing a tent into the tunica vaginalis ; a small incision is made through the tunica vaginalis and scrotum, and a piece of lint or sponge is introduced, so as to prevent the sudden escape of the water; the water gradually issues out, during which time adhesion and granulation often take place; but this some- times fails. Caustic and setons were formerly very much used, two remedies, about which there was as much bandying and quarrelling among the members of the profession as if the world were at stake on the issue—two remedies now which are not only generally abandoned, but which I should 1« ashamed to own evqi- having used; such is the folly of quar- relling in our profes.sion ; as for arguments on subjects which are only to be settled by observation, they are of no u.se_; and persons who argue thus a priori, without a knowledge of facts, which alone ought to form the basis of argument in our pro- fession, want that judgment which conducts a man best through life ; but many were the advocate.-: of caustic a.« a cure for hydrocele ; and the way it was used was by taking the potassa fusa, and applying it to the fore part of the scrotum, till an eschar, of the size of a sixpence, is formed, which pro- duces an irritation to the extent of half an inch, or three- quarters of an inch around, and then the eschar so produced destroys the skin and tunica vaginalis ; as soon as the inflam- mation arises, the water escapes, then the parts sometimes become glued together, .and granulations arise. Well, gentle- men, this remedy soon fell into disrepute ; 1st, on account of its uncertainty ; 2dly, hec.ause it w.as dangerous to life; here is a specimen (pointing to one on the table'', t.akcn trom a person who died from t!ie application of caustic, .and this gives me an opportunity of showing you the state ol the p.aits after the use of this application. The operation with caustic is dangerous to life, and ought not to be performed.

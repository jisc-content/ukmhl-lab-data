ON ASCITES, OR PERITONEAL DROPSY. 377 iiip tlie body a gentle sudden jerk frouj side to side, fliictuatioij will be readily jierceived. As the secretion of water increases, the abdomen becomes more tense, pressure is produced on the diaphragm, wdiich occasions a difficulty of breatliing, which is more especially felt in the hurry of exercise, so that dyspiima at length becomes a very distressing symptom, arising from the accumulation of waterin the abdomen, until it leaches tlie lower part of the diaphragm, in consequence of which the contraction of that muscle becomes necessarily impeded, and the difficulty of breathing thereby produced. As the abdomen increases, fluctuation may, as I before stated to you, be easily distinguished, by ajiplying your hand to one side of the body, and by gently tapping the opposite side with the other, the un ■ dulations of the water wall be readily felt by the fingers which are pressing on the abdomen ; thus, then, the fluid being so readily felt, and the symptoms so manifest, viz. :— The difficulty of breathing, the great increase of that quick- ness, on taking exercise, the inconvenience arising from the .■^lightest pressure by the clothes, and the gradual enlargement of the abdomen, so strongly jiointing out the true character of the disease, it is hardly possible you can form an incorrect opinion respecting it. The quantity of water usually drawn from individuals af- fected w’ith ascites, is from twenty-five to thirty pints ; in this respect, however, as you may suppose, there is considerable va- riation, but the quantity a surgeon expects who has perform- ed the operation of tapping on many |)ersons, is what 1 ha\ c Just stated to you ; and from twenty-five to thirty pints, the first time the operation is performed, will be the quantity ge- nerally drawn off. The fluid secreted in ascites is serous, but does not contain so much albumen as serum in general ; when ascites is pre- sent, and inflammation of the abdomen follows, it will occa- sionally happen that so large a quantity of adhe.sive matter will escape trom the vessels as to mix with the serum, and cause it readily to coagulate, by the addition of the mineral acids or alcohol; but such a quantity (jf adhesive matter as produces this effect is not often met with. The fluid, therefore, found in ascites, is more of a watery nature, having in its composi- tion less albumen than sei um in general. 'I’liE Causes of Ascites. 1 he most common cause of ascites is disease of the liver : in this period of our session it would be impertinent in me to describe to you the anatomy of this part; you will, therefore, readily understand me when 1 say, tliat diseases of the liver, by impeding the circulation of the blood through that organ,

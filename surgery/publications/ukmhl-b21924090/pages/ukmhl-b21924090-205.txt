189 ox THE CURE OP HYDROCELE. feet on the complaint. But J also stated on a former evening tliat hydrocele is produced by an inflammatory .state of the parts, and that in these cases ab.sorption by stimulating lotions should be promoted. I will now further add, that in young persons and children, vvlio are not unfrequently subject to this aflection, cure by absorption alone is elfected, that is, by giving th^ hydrargyri submurias, scammouy, rhubarb, and other me- dicines, so as to dispose the constitution to absorb. The liquor amniunite acetatis and aminoniae murias are the local applica- tions generally made uSe of to promote absorption in the jiarts, and what we do to facilitate the operation of these remedies, is, to have a bag or .suspensory truss to hold the scrotum, and this is fastened by two tapes round the abdomen, just below the umbilicus, and kept constantly wet with those fluids, in order to stimulate the absorbents ; therefore be on your guard about performing an operation for hydrocele in young persons, as the cure can be effected by absorption alone ; there are a few exceptions, however, to this rule, but they are exceedingly rare, as in almost every case of hydrocele in young persons or children, the water will be absorbed. ith respect to the adhesion of the tunica vaginalis in the cure of hvdroccle, this is effected in three ways, by injection, seton, or incision ; but the use of injections does not always l)ioduce adhesion of the tunica vaginalis ; here is a specimen (pointing to one on the table), which was taken from a captain of a ship one morning, on whom I performed the ope- ration for hydrocele by injection, by which he was relieved of every symptom of the complaint; several years after this he was taken e.xtreniely ill, and I was consulted by his attendant surgeon ; he was dying of some organic affection ; I desired the surgeon to remove tlie testicle and tunica vaginalis from ttic side on whicli the operation hud been perfornied, us soon as the patient was dead, which wa.s done; on examination it evas found that the tunica vaginalis did not adhere completely, there were a few adhesions in some parts but not generally â€¢ the injection did not produce adhesion, but a new series of ac- tions was set up, a deposit was secreted, and the ends of the arteries were sealed, so that any further secretion was pre- vented. ' 1 he process of granulation is set up when an ilicision is made in the scrotum, and extraneous bodies introduced, but this requires considerable caution; some surgeons use one mode of cure, some another; various are the operations which nave been proposed, but most have now yielded to that of in- jection. In the operation by incision you divide the scrotum ml tunica vaginalis, on the front part, so as to allow the wa-

363 ON DISEASES OF THE BREAST. means daugerous to life ; it is generally very young people who are attacked by it, and we seldom see it in persons above thirty vears of age. I will try to deseribe, in a familiar man- ner, the mode in which this disease will be exhibited to you; A young person, between the age of fifteen and thirty, vyill be brought to you by ber parents, on account of a swelling in hei- breast; when you look at her, you see that she has a perfectly healthy appearance, and, in all probability, is much younger than those who are usually attacked by scirrhous tubercle. Her parents being naturally anxious for their child’s safety, express their fears of the disease being cancerous; at this you smile, and tell them that cancer does not attack persons of her healthy appearance, or persons so young ; upon examining the breast you find an exceedingly moveable tumour, but more diffused in the surrounding substance than true scirrhus ; that is, its limits are not so accurately or distinctly defined, having likewise a lobulated feel, being divided into distinct apart- ments by septa, producing the same kind of sensation to the fingers as fatty tumours; you have here (delivering a prepa - ration to a student) an opportunity of seeing this kind of tu- mour, and upon carefully examining it, you will find that the account which I have given you is correct. Well, then, the age aud healthy appearance of the person ; the lobulated feel of the tumour, aud its lying more blended with the neigh- bouring parts, will at once point out to you that the disease is not cancerous ; which, gentlemen, you may inform the per- son’s parents, and likewise tell them that the disease never will become cancerous. I assure you that this disea.se is not in the slightest degree of a malignant character, neither is it attended with the least danger. Now then, as to the result of these tumours; they may grow larger, and may be attended with pain at the periods of menstruation, but never will prove of serious consequence ; upon that you may depend. If, how- ever, the mind should be rendered wretched in consequence of the existence of such a tumour, an incision will instantly enable you to remove it, and thereby allay all mental irrita- tion ; but as far as the tumour is itself concerned, and as re- gards the health or safety of the patient, the operation is by no means necessary; the size of the tumour is generally from that of a filbert or walnut to that of a billiard ball. Here are some preparations (giving them to the students) in which you can see their general size and character; here, however, is one of very considerable magnitude ; it appeared that the general health of the woman from whom this tumour was taken, was very little affected; she felt pain in the tumour at the men- struating period, but there was no broken state of constitu-

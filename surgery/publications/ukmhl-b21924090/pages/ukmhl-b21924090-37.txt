21 ON INFLAMMATION. The second kind of specific inflammation is caused by the application of poisons. Thus, in gonorrhopa, tlie matter se- creted is widely difterent from common healthy matter, hav- ing, in the first place, a much larger quantity of mucus mixed with it; and, secondly, when applied to a secreting surface, is capable of exciting in the part an action by which similar matter and the same effects can be produced. The matter of small-pox occa.sions the same result, and as far as constitu- tional effects are concerned, it does not seem material how lante or how small a quantity of the poison is applied, the re- sult ill each case depending upon the state of the constitution.

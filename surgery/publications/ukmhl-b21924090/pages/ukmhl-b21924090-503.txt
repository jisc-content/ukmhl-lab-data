INFLAMMATION OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. 487 thighs, so as to occasion the point of the instrument imme- diately to rise perpendicularly above the pubes. Well, then there is no other difficulty of introducing the catheter in this disease more than is experienced under ordinary circuni- stance.s. Recollect, after having passed the curved part of the urethra (the situation of which 1 have already explained to you), you are then to depress the handle as much as you pos- sibly can ; this will cause the point to enter the bladder be- tween the pubes and eidarged lobe. If any gentleman within these walls should ever be under the necessity of puncturing the bladder for enlarged prostate, which 1 trust in God he will not, it must be done above the l)ubes ; but it never need he attempted at all, if you can per- form your duty. I have known enlarged prostate occasionally occur in verv young jjeople ; an instance of this kind hap- pened in the other hospital : a boy was admitted, having symptoms of stone : but, before I say more of this, while I think of it, I want to add a tew words on the treatment of diseased prostate. An elastic gum catheter is sometimes in- troduced into the bladder, and kept there : in passing an elas- tic gum catheter, the removal of the stilette will sometimes cause it to enter with ease, when it would not previously pa«s at all. If it be deemed re((uisite to leave the catheter in the bladder, I should prefer one of pewter rather than elastic gum, for it can be curved down before the scrotum, and, by plug- ging up the end, the patient may move about as he likes, and, at any time he wishes, can expel his urine, 'I'hus the instru- ment becomes productive of great comfort Let me observe to you, lliat if vou employ a pewter catlieter, it should be quite new, and ought not to be worn for a longer period than a fort- jiight, for the urine acts upon the metal, renders it brittle, and may probably cause the instrument to snap, if the time i>e extended beyond what 1 have stated. I just now mentioned to you, in reference to young persons having enlarged prostate, that a boy was admitted into the other hospital, having symptoms of stone, in consequence of which he was sounded, and the operation of lithotomy was about to be performed ; tlie sounding, however, brought on inflammation of the bladder, which terminated in the boy’s death ; upon di.s.section, it was found that the symptoms for which he bad been sounded, were produced by an enlarged prostate gland. 1 have one other observation to make ; persons will come to you for some supposed complaint in the bladder, and, upon inquiry, they will tell you, that they can pass their urine ; now, if the disease consists of enlarged prostate, some urine

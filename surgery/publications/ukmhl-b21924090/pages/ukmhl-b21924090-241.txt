ON HERNIA. OOK care the two ends of tlie artery, by which means you will be able to luire a good view of the different parts during the re- mainder of the operation. Having secured the vessel, you scratch through the fascia of the cord, just below the ring, witli considerable care, sepa- rating it from the cremaster muscle; a small opening being made, you introduce a director upwards to the abdominal ring, and iuferiorly to the lower part of the swelling, and di- vide the fascia'more or less, as may be required ; the nest parts that will be brought into view are the fibres of the cre- master muscle, passing- obliquely from above downwards ; this covering is of considerable density, and must be opened with care ; a director is to be introduced under it, in the same way as the fascia of the cord, and then it is to be divi- ded ; as soon as this is done the liernial sac becomes e.xposed ; it is of a blue appearance, and semi-transparent, from the fluid it contains ; so the character of the sac is quite different from that of the coverings, and the one may be easily distin- guished from the other. Having laid bare the sac, you pinch it between your lingers, and feel distinctly the intestine and omentum within it; in rubbing the hernial sac between the fingers do not use any force, as this is exceedingly dangerous ; well, when you have raised the sac so as to separate it from Its contents, take the knife and make a small cut into it, not downwards, but in a lateral direction ; place the instrument horizontally, so as to avoid the danger of wounding the intes- tine, a danger to which you would be exposed if you cut downwards._ As soon as an opening is made, water generally escapes, if inte.stine be included in the sac, and there are no adhesions. Having opened the hernial sac, a director is to be introduced as far as the abdominal ring, and them it is to be •divided up to that extent; the director is then to be carried to the lower pai t of the sac in the same way. When both 'Omentum and intestine are in the sac, the omentum will be Hound before, and the intestine behind; there will also be a 'small portion of omentum at the upper part. After having |Opened the hernial sac, the great difficulty commences • you iare next to feel for the stricture; put your finger (and the iiittfe one is best for the purpose) into the hernial sac, and lascertain If the stricture is situated in the abdominal ring- and If ,t I.S, wh-dt you have to do is, to spread the omentum on the foie part of the intestine, like an apron, so as to cover it en- tirely; by this plan the intestine is le.ss liable to be wounded, and It adds e.xceediiigly to the security of the patient; and then you ipass a probe-pointed bistoury, guided on the finger, and divide e stricture, not very freely, but to asinall extent; a slight mo-

Oc- casionally the stream rises perpendicularly, its long axis being at right angles to the long axis of the penis ; thus, then, the retention of a few drops of urine after the whole appears to have been discharged, a more frequent propensity to make water than when in health, and the peculiar characters of the stream, as just described to you, will be conclusive evidence of the existence of stricture. In addition, there will sometimes be a discharge from the urethra, which renders the linen of a bluish-white, similar to the appearances produced by nocturnal emissions : if the individual rides much on horseback the urine will be high-coloured, depending upon the degree of excitement e.xistiug in the urethra. The next thing which the patient notices is, that he discharges his urine by drops; and, from the irritable state of the bladder, the water is con- stantly dropping or distilling away from the orifice of the urethra. An individual, then, having permanent stricture, first observes a few drops of water remain after the whole seems to have been discharged, then notices a fine spiral or divided stream, and, lastly, discharges his water by drops only ; in this last state, for the purpose of facilitating the escape of the urine, and preventing its being retained by the laeunÂ® of the uretlira, he draws out the penis with consider- able force ; and thus, to express it in the clearest way, milks himself. Well, the next circumstance yon observe is the discharge of a considerable quantity of mucus along with the urine ; this is owing to the inflammation having extended to the mucous membrane of the bladder ; the urine, when discharged, is as transparent as usual; but when it has cooled, the mucus de- scends to the bottom, where it appears ropy, and adheres to the vessel. As the intlaramation of the membrane increases, the urine becomes yellow; but, if heated, the yellowness is not seen ; and, when allowed to stand, as I before stated, the mucus will sink to the bottom. These facts will explain to you whether the urine contains mucus or pus. When the dis- ease is of a very aggravated nature, the urine will become quite white; but, in all the stttges of the complaint, the colour of the water will be according to the degree of inflammatory excitement; iind, when very severe, it will be charged with a

116 ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD. extensive as that just described, and where tlic patient, upfjii being spoken to, raises himself, as if awoke fiom a sound sleep, and where some power of volition still remains, you w ill find one of the best diagnostic symptoms to be the accelerated ac- tion of the pulse upon the patient exerting himself; a man in this state with a pulse at 70, on being raised, oi attempting to walk, will have it inordinately quickened, it will instantly beat 130 in a minute ; this is a never-failing symptom, and where the patient can be made to exert himself at all, will W found a sure characteristic of the disease. There is also in these cases a greater action of the carotids than in health ; they beat more violently, though not more quickly, if the pa- tient be at rest ; if asked what are the best marked symptoms of concussion, I should say this increased motion of the ca- rotids ; the apparent tranquil sleep; the instantaneous relapse to that state after having been roused ; the remarkable ex- citement of the pulse upon using exertion, and insensibility having immediately followed the injury. The diminution of the operations of the mind is often .=o great in concussion, even where considerable voluntary motion remains, that you cannot, even by hallooing as loudly as you are cap.ihle, get any other answer from your j)atient, than ‘ eh delivered in a gruff under-tone. 1 have know n several very curious circumstances of this kind one case was that of a gentleman who had met w-ith an injury of the head, by which concussion had been itroduced—every endeavour to get a word from him was ineffectual ; yet, at one period, when the attendants were all absent, he got out of bed, bolted the door, made water, and returned to bed again, in the same manner as though he had been in perfect health : when the servant went back, he found the door fastened ; all their knocking was unavailing ; they w'ere obliged to break it open, and then could not procure from him a single word. Indeed, 1 do not believe the noise of an earthquake would have succeeded in rousing him from his lethargy; yet lie could get out of bed, pass his urine, and adopt his ordinary habit ot delicacy, by bolting the door. I have caught a man, when labouring under the effects of concussion, with liis icet in a chninber pot, and bv the action of his hands, it was evident that he was trying to throw water over his legs ; upon the servant gmtig into the room of the same individual some days alti r. he’was tound to be attemptingto shave himself, and having no lather, he sub- stituted a pot of spermaceti ointment, whirl! he had brushed "''\Tunpose vou have all heard of the extraordinary change which the memory sometimes undergoes tmiii the cflects ot

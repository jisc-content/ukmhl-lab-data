LECTURES m SURGERyf Introductory L}5cture. Gentlemen.—While it is the province of the physician to attend to internal diseases, it is the duty of the surgeon to attend to those that are external; to perforin operations for the removal of diseased parts ; and to know how to regulate the system by the use of medicine, when local diseases are produced by constitutional derangement. Surgery is usually divided into the principles and practice. The first are learned from observations on the living when diseased, by dissection of the dead, and by experiments on living animal's. Our de- ductions from these sources furnish us with the means of knowing a malady by its symptoms, the alteration of structure in a part when diseased, and the various ways in which Nature attempts the reparative process, both in external and internal parts. A man who has seen much of morbid preparations po.ssesses great advantages ; but his anatomical knowledge cannot be perfect unless he has frequently seen and assisted in the di.s.section of the human body. In the surgical science hypothe.sis should be entirely discarded, and sound theory’ derived from actual observation and experience, alone encou- raged. The first is an ignus fatuus, which is sure to mislead • the last a polar star, a never-failing guide. Experiments on living animals have been found of the greatest utility in di- recting ns to a knowledge of the means by which Nature acts in the reparation of injuries, and in the restoration of lo.st part.s.

ON THE DIFFERENT AMPUTATIONS. 405 upon the upper bridge, then, turning the screw by which the two bridges are connected, you can produce upon the vessel any degree of pressure that may be required, for the screw separates one bridge from the other, thus raising the upper bridge, pressing upon the lower one, at the same time tight- ening the band, and forcing the pad upon the vessel, you ef- fectually control the circulation of the blood in the limb to which the instrument is applied ; this is the tourniquet at present in general use; another has lately been invented hav- ing small spikes at one extremity of the bridge, and these per- forate the band after it has been tightly applied round the limb, when, upon turning the screw of this instrument, the same effect is produced as by the other. The tourniquet, in operations where it can be used, will be found of very great service ; 1 mean, will be of considerable utility to the operator in point of facilitating the operation, and at the same time rendering it more safe. As an auxiliary, however, its convenience will be much more felt in private than in hospital practice, for in the former there is commonly a deficiency of those able assistants, whom we so generally meet with in the latter, yet the tourniquet, when it can be applied, will more effectually control the circulation than pressure by the hand. 1 will now show you where the tourniquet should be applied when we operate on the upper extremity : for example, if you amputate the arm above the elbow it should be fixed as near as possible to the axilla, this will afford you room for dissect- ing back the integuments, and, at the same time, will allow of the retraction of the muscles. If you amputate below the elbow, the instrument should be applied about the middle of the arm, and this is the best place for putting it, on account of the pressure acting more immediately upon the vessel in this ^situation than when applied higher up, for here nothing hut integuments and cellular membrane at the inner edge of the biceps muscle covers the artery ; therefore, if you operate below the elbow, let the tourniquet be applied on the middle of the arm ; if above the elbow, not lower than one third of the length of the arm downwards. When you amputate below the knee you should fix the in- strument on the middle of the thigh, with the pad on the fe- moral artery, at the inner side of the sartorius muscle; if jou amputate above the knee, you must then fix it one third the length of the limb downwards ; the reason of your apply- •‘'low of the retraction of the muscles, as 1 heforc stated to you with regard to the arm, but its ne- cessity IS much greater here, as I shall hereafter explain to

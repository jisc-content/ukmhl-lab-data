ox NASAL POLYPI. 428 probe-poiiitfcl scissors. After cutting tlirough the peduncle It you desire tlie patient to blow his nose, tlie air will force it out of the nostril; but 1 .should tell you, that when thus re- inoved, they are more likely to return than when extracted by the foiceps, because you do not with the scLs.sors take away, as with the forceps, the pituitary membrane, and this 2S the source whence these polypi spring. But, gentlemen, polypi not unfrequently extend into the posteiioi nates, even back as far as the spine, in which situa- tion you may not only often feel them with the finger, but, when of this magnitude, frequently see them ; these rÂ«dvpi must be removed by a pair of forceps exceedingly curved- their curve should describe at least half a circle, the curve of course being of such a size as to admit its free introduction into the mouth, these forceps should be passed to the back of the mouth, then their points or blades, are to be carried up the posterior nares, when, having satisfied yourself in the inannei before directed that you have hold of the peduncle, you are to break it olf by moving the forceps in a direction downwards and backwards. Another way, when the polypus is large, and when the jieduncle grows from the side of the antium, is to divide it by means of a pair of cuixed scissors, and then with your finger hook down the polypus at the back of the mouth, from over the velum pendulum palati; in this way it falls into the throat, and produces a sensation of choaking; retching is the consequence, and the polvpus will be thiovvn upon the floor before you. Mr. Ring, a surgeon of Reading, had a patient with a polypus of this kind, removed in the manner I have just mentioned to you ; it was a very- large one, and when I first went to Reading, 1 put a licature upon it, but this did not jirove of any' use, it onlv succeeded in getting away a small portion of it, the root was not remov- ed ; the polypus soon became again as large as ever ; and I am now of opinion, that a ligature in these cases should never be applied. If, after the operation has been performed, you think any portion of the polypus remain.s, you should, by means of a probe, pass up a piece of lint to the spot, to prevent anv an- noyance from hemorrhage; the lint previous to its introduc- tion may be dipped in a solution of alum ; indeed, where pa- tients have objected to have the polypi removed by the forceps or scissors, it has- been recouimentlcd to use injections of so- lutions of alum, or the oxymur. hydrarg. The next species of nasal polypi which I shall describe to you, is the

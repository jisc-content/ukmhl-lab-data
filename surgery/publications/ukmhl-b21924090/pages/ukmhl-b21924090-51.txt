35 LOCAL TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. the table that he had a few more remarks to inake, but these would be’ on another subject ; viz.—the occasional retraction of the skin of a stump, after amputation. A surgeon, at Worthing, took oft a boy s arm, pretty neai the sboiilder-joint; the stump healed kindly, and all was thought to be doing well: some months after, however, he complained of jiain, and the skin retracted to such an e.xtent, that the bone projected through it at least an inch ; in this state he came to town, and upon examining the part near the a’rni-pit, I put my linger upon a small tumour; this oc- casioned the boy to jump as though he had been electrihed ; I then performed the operation oi amputation at the shoiiloei joint, and upon examination, it was tound^ that tlie tiimoui which had been touched before the operation, and produced the electric shock, was a large ganglion of nerves, and it had given rise to the excessive irritability of the stump, and the retraction of the skin. Previously to the above case, a buy was sent to ine, with a stump similar to the one 1 have just described, but in the leg ; the ends of the bones were cut off, and the boy left the hos- pital apparently well ; but soon after the. arm case from Worthing had been operated upon, and the natrre of the dis- ease ascertained, this boy again returned, having his stuiu|) in a painful, irritable state, and the skin evidently retracted. Knowing now the cause of the mischief, I cut down upon, and took out the end of the posterior tibial nerve : the bad symptoms consequently disappeared, and the lad eventually recovered. Going round the hospital the other day, I met with another case resembling the above, but, >ii point of irritability, much worse. At the particular request of the woman, 1 amputated— the nerre.s appeared to be enlarged, and had formed a ganglion partially re.sting on the extremity of the bone ; this had pro- duced .such a degree of irritation, that no part of the stump could be touched without exciting a kind of electric shock ; in fact, the woman appeared very much to resemble a sensi- tive plant. How the nerves become longer than the bones in these cases doe.s not admit of easy explanation.

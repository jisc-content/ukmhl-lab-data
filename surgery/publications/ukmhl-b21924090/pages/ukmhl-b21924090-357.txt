ON CALCULI IN THE SUBMAXILLARY DUCT. 341 himself of the slightest hint, and to produce mechanical con- trivances admirably adapted for the purposes tor which they may be suggested. LECTURE XLII. The subject with which I propose to occupy your attention this evening, is the diseases of the breast; but before I proceed to them I have a few words to say to you on calculi in the subiuaxillary duct. Calculi in the Submaxillary Duct. Stones are occasionally found in the duct of the subina.xillary gland, and produce irritation, the cause of which is unintelligi- ble to the patient, and often not distinguished by the surgeon. The unplea.sant feelings produced by stones in this part occur at and after meals ; the stones arrest the progress of the saliva, and produce irritation of the surrounding muscles ; a swelling forms at the orifice of the duct; day after day the swelling returns, and at last the patient puts his finger along the side of the tongue, feels .something hard there, aud by this means it is discovered that there is a stone in the submaxillary duct, which has produced the accumulation of saliva, aud given rise to the irritation experienced by the patient. Sometimes a small channel is formed through the stone, which allows of the escape of the saliva ; but in all cases the degree of irrita- tion depends on the retention of the saliva. A gentleman with whom 1 formerly lived had a stone in his submaxillary duct, and be used to say to me that he had a curious sensation in his inylo-hyoideus muscle, a spasm of that muscle ; this continued for weeks and months; but one day he sent for me, and said that he had discovered the cause of the irritation that he had so long felt in 'the mylo-hyoideus muscle ; that it was a stone formed in the suhmaxillary duct; he requested me to take it out for him, which 1 did. \Vith respect to the operation required for the removal of stones from this partâ€”you must place your finger under the jaw, and press against the gland ; an assistant holds the cheek on one side, so as to bring it as far as possible to the ear ; you then perceive the duct under the tongue; you raise the duct and tongue, and feel for the stone, and having discovered it, you elevate the cyst, and with a cataract knife cut on the stone, and then with the end of a hook you puli it out; it is very easily removed, and there is no danger of wound- ing any vessels, supposing you press the duct towards the mouth ; if you omit this, you may wound some artery, aud

284 ON CAUSES OF CATARACT. inquired into; and if you find tlie patient has all, or the greater part of them—that is, if the defect of sit-ht has been increas- ing just in proportion to the increase of the opacity of the lens and the patient has had no pain in the head, and’the motions of the ins are free, and light can be distinguished ; then von may operate, and with the chance of success, as there are" no evident reasons against it. For by the first circumstance you see that the vision ha.« been impaired in consequence of the opacity of the lens : bv tlie second, that there has been no disorganizing inflammation in tlie eye, or that the brain and origin of the optic nerves lave not been affected ; by the third, that the retina is sound ; and by the fourth, if tlie opacity of the lens be removed, that the letina will be in a state to receive the impression of exter- nal objects. But these signs are not so certain as they might appear, for the iris might act, and yet amaurosis exist : and if one eye were not closed, the motions of the iris of the other might be prevented, by sympathy from the other. 'I'hus it ap- pears that the state of the iris does not always determine the existence of amaurosis. When there is cataract, the operation must be regulated by taking all the circumstances into consi- deiation ; by the figure of the cataract: whether there are anv adhesions of the iris to the capsule of the crystalline lens; and especially by the patient being able to distinguish objects, and light from darkne.ss ; but thoueh this is a favourable svmptom, yet pel sons may have amaurosis, and be able to distiiiiruish dav from night, and even objects from one another. On the whole", it is a very favourable symptom, and when present, the opera- tion may be performed. In general, when the case is doubtful, you had better perform the operation, of course taking care to inform the patient of the state of the case; the pain is not great, and you will not leave the patient in a worse state than before the operation. It would be extremely culpable for anv one to operate where it was quite apparent that no relief could be afforded ; and yet I am sorry to say, that I have known indi- viduals operate where there was no more chance of doing good than if the eye had been scooped out of the head—such men are unprincipled, and would undertake anv thine for the purpose of gain. Another question to be determined on is, whether the opera- tion should be performed if one eye only is affected } The an- swer appears to be plain, yet there are some who contend that the operation should be resorted to when there is cataract in one eye only, and their princijial reason is this ; thev sav, that it is known a sympathy exists between the two eyes', and that if a morbid action is set up in one, it will be excited sympathe-

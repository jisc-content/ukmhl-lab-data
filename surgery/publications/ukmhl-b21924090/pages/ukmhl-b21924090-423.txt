ON THE DIFFERENT AMPUTATIONS. 407 of the bone; to say the truth, this is not the best mode of amputating the huger; it is better to make your oblique cut through the web longer than I have just described to you, so as to carry it beyond the joint some way up the metacarpal bone; you make a similar incision on tlie other side of the joint,â€™aud having cleared the bone from its muscular and ligamentous atuchments, you saw through the metacarpal bone itself. The two fingers which were next the diseased one, now ap- proximate, and if kept in this situation until adhesion of the integuments has taken place, very little deformity of the hand will be produced : if, on the other hand, a portion of the finger be left projecting, the inconvenience of the stump will not only be felt in the motion of the fingers, but a disagree- able deformity be obvious to every spectator; in the operation I have just shewn you, neither one nor the other will exist, comparatively speaking ; there cannot be, of course, any an- noyance from a stnmp, and the deformity will be scarcely observable : well then, we seldom amputate the finger at the second or third joint, unless at the particular desire of the pa- tient ; neither ilo we recommend the operation at the first joint, but rather the one which I have just mentioned to you, viz. that of sawing through the metacai'pal bone a little way above the knuckle. The next operation that I shall describe to you is the Amputation of the Metacarpal Bone of the Thumb. To accomplish this operation, you must begin your incision by cutting through the integuments at the inside of the thumb, nearly opposite the first joint; you carry this incision back- wards to the union of the metacarpal with the carpal bones ; this incision will form a flap, consisting of integuments and the abductor muscles, quite sufficient to cover the wound that will be occasioned by the operation. After having com- pleted this flap, the knife is then to be passed backward from between the index finger and thumb as far as the tra- pezium, to which bone the head of the metacarpal bone is ar- ticulated ; when you arrive at this position, you are to- turn the knife so as to make its blade form a right angle with the incision just made ; you are then to carry its edge through the joint, by which the ligaments will be divided, and the bone is thu.s removed : the flap^ you observe, that 1 first left, and which Is formed principally of the abductor pollicis and the integuments is quite suffirieut to cover the wound. The me- tacarpal l)oue of the little finger is removed by nearly a .simi- lar operation. You begin your incision at the web between it and the ring finger; carry down to the articulation with tlie

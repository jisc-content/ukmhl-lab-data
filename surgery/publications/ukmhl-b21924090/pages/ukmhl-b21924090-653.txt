637 ON BURNS AND SCALDS. heal smoothly, but afterwards become puckered. These con- tractions are apt especially to occur in the neck, by which the skin is united to the chest; and if the arm be the burnt part, the fore-arm becomes united to the upper-arm. _ The lingers become united to each other, and the thumb is sometimes bent very much backwards. This contraction may be pre- vented ill the arm by passing a splint behind the arm, and keeping the arm extended on it. The same rule should be attended to, if there be any danger of the thigh uniting to the abdomen. You should pass a splint behind the thigh, and keep the thigh extended on it, and the contraction will be prevented. But as to the neck, do all you can, by binding the head back, or to either side, yet the contractions will take place. When the cuticle is removed, and the cutis is in a granulating state, you may produce cuticle over it very quickly by using the acetate of zinc wash, made by putting two grains of the sulphate of zinc to one ounce of the liquor plumhi subacetatis dilutus. This object is sometimes well ac- complished by sprinkling the granulations with the oxide of zinc. But the lotion appears to me to be the best. Some lint should be dipped in the lotion, and laid on the wound ; over this some folded linen should be placed, and over the whole a piece of oiled silk, to prevent evaporation. FINIS. r.

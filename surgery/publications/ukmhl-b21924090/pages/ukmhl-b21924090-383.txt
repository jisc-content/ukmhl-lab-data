At the same time that you are using the plaster, you should give to the patient the eighth or si.\'teenth of a grain of the oxymur. hydrarg. iii 5i. of tinct. cinchon. bis. die. Or if the bowels should be disordered, you may substitute for the tinct. cinchon. 51. of tinct. rhei. The plaster constantly used, and these medicines occasionally taken, you will generally lind, in the course of six months, that the complaint has been subdued. 1 have known it cured as early as the third month from the commencement of this treatment.

It is not my intention to enter at any length into the causes which produce retention of urine ; for this part of the subject I shall leave until 1 describe to you the venereal disease, which 1 shall shortly have occasion to do. I shall at present merelv state, that the most frequent causes of retention of urine, are strictures in the urethra, and enlargement of the prostate gland. There are several other causes, which give rise to this state ; an accumulation of blood in the bladder ; stones in the urethra, or the [iressnre of matter between th.e jirostate gland and the rectum, will sometimes occasion a necessity for

410 ON PorsONS. duce the best possible effects-arsenic is an exateple ,.f Poisons are derived from five sources, riz.: there are those fioui thu ammaland vegetaUe kin^dom-thert art the mine- se//T poisons—and another furnished by man him- self, Is called morbid poison. Voil will find such a difference with regard to the effects of w'Jf‘^°™Pai-ed with the others, that vou vill speedily relinquish any opinion you might have formed lespecting a supposed reciprocity of action between them. °P^'®‘'oos of poisons, we find some of them nnu ' system, others the nervous, while many poisons affect both the nervous and vascular systems at the same time. In looking at poisons from many animals for example, we find the first action in the arterial system, while tlie influence of others evidently begins in the nerves. The poison communicated by the viper and rattle-snake attacks he arterial system first; that from the bite of a rabid animal influences the nervous system first; but ultimately in these cases both become affected : thus, then, some prisons first arfect the nervous system, others the arterial, and others With regard to the vegetable poisons—all of these act on the nervous system : persons who hare been destroyed bv these poisons, have been said, upon examination after'deatb', to have had inflauiination of the inner coat of the stomach because some instances the vessels have been found lareer and more filled with blood than in others. These appear- ances, however, are common in cases of sudden death, where there has been congestion of the vessels of the stomach 1 hese appearances are not the effect of inflammation, thev have nothing of the character of inflamed mucous mem- branes, and are entirely destitute'of that vivid redness which ever accompanies the latter. No ; the influence of vegetable poisons IS directly on the nerves ; and, in the next lecture, I will shew you a curious experiment with one of these poi- sons, when you will have an opportunity of seeing an animal taking food almost at the very moment of its death ; the dis- solution of the animal will occur in a very few minutes after the introduction of the poison under the skin; so that the shortness of the time in which the effect is produced, will shew the^impossibility of its having been the result of inflam- mation. Thus, gentlemen, will vegetable poisons destroy life by diiect influence on the nervous system, without givinir rise to the slightest inflammation. iVlineral poisons destroy, some by arterial, and some by nervous influence ; but tho.«e which

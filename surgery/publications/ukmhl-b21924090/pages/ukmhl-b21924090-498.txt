LECTURE LVIIL The first subject on which I shall this evening eneage your attention is, enlargement of the prostate gland.

Well, then, the first circumstance by which you know that an old person has chronic enlargement of the prostate gland, is the length of time he reijuires for the purpose of voiding his urine. All of you must have observed that an old gentleman

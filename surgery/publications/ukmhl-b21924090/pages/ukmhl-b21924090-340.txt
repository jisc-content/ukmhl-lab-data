OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. S24 the well-known fact, that a calculus may be detected by the sound at one time and not at another ; so that if, after an ex- amination, you were positively to tell a person that he had not a stone in his bladder, and upon being sounded the following day by another surgeon he was as positively assured to tlie contrary, if it should jtrove in the sequel that yon were wroue, the patient would lose all confidence in you, entertain opinions unfavourable to your professional talents, and report you to his friends accordingly. Be therefore on your guard. In the lateral operation of lithotomy, you are to begin your incision a little on the left side of the raphe, immediately below the symphysis pubis, and carry it obliquely downward*: and outwards to midway between the anus and tuberosity of the ischium, and the termination of the incision should be opposite the centre of the anus. Before you commence the incision, you should draw aside the ra|)he towards the ramus of the ischium on the light side. Never begin an operation without having first reflected well on what you are going to do; and in making incisions throngh the skin, you should, before you apply the knife, mark out with your eye the course which such incisions should take, and the precise point where they should terminate. Well then, the first cut through the skin, made in the direction just mentioned, penetrates the skin and cellular substance, and lays bare the accelerator uriute ; yon then with the fingers of your left hand push or draw the bulb of the penis under the ramus of the ischium on the right side, so that the next incision will pass between the bulb and cm> penis of the left side ; there is no necessity in reality for cut- ting the bulb, and it should therefore be avoided ; well, carry- ing your knife forward between the bulb and crus, you divide the accelerator urinas, and this you should do completely, tor if you permit any portion of its fibres to remain undivided, particularly at the u|)per part, if the stone should be at all large, you would find that their contractions would very much increase the difficulty of withdrawing the stone ; as soon as the accelerator urinae has been cut through, you e.vpose the transverse perinei ; you are then to feel for the groove of the staff with the nail of the index finger of the left hand, and having fully satisfied yourself of its situation, you aix' to cut into it through the metubranous part of the urethra by means of the same scalpel with which you made the other incisions ; and then, fixing the beak of the gorect in the gntove of the staft', you are to bring down towards you the handle of the latter instrument, while at the same moment you push the gorget into the bladder, with its point directed upwards, and its handle of course somewhat depressed. 1 give you this last

But in the hospital I general y order, w'hen I expect much resistance, tlie waini bath and nauseating doses of taitarized antimony to precede the application of the pulleys. _ If the patient should be an elderly lady, or a relaxed, ema- ciated person, you may generally succeed in reducing the dislocation in this tvay :—Put the person in a low chair • cany the knee into the axilla, by separating the arm suffi- ciently from the side, and let your foot rest on the foot of the chair ; take hold of the arm firmly, just aboye the condyles, with one hand, and place the other on the shoulder; draw the arm orer the knee, raise the knee a little at the same tmie, and depress the shoulder with the other hand, when the bone will generally slip into its socket.

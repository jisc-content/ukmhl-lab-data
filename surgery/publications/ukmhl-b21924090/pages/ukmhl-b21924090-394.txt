378 ON ASCITES, OR PERITONEAL DROPSY, by obstructing its free passage, must, of necessity, occasion a congestion of blood in the vessels of the rnesenters-, stomach, spleen, pancreas, and neighhouring parts ; and for the relief of this congestion, nature is under the necessitv ofetrusing, from the filled vessels, the serum which we subsequentlv find in the bag of the peritoneum. But besides this common cause of ascites, arisioE from the mechanical obstruction of return to the blood, there'is another cause which very frequently produces the disease, viz., en- largement of the abdominal viscera; say the spleen, for ex- ample ; from its enlargement, it presses upon and irritates the peritoneum ; a greater quantity of blood than usual is then determined to the part with a view of getting rid of the irri- tation, which, however, still continuing, the serum becomes secreted so profusely, as to produce the disease of which I am now speaking ; so that although the two causes I have men- tioned are widely different in principle, yet in effect thev are precisely similar. In the first it is produced through mechanical obstruction ; whereas in the last it is the result of local irritation ; besides the causes just named, there are others which produce it; the most common is the debility arising from fever. Mercurv likewise will give rise to it, if administered in such quantities as to exceed or overcome the powers of the body in debilitated constitutions ; the two last mentioned causes are favourable ones, and ascites is frequently cured when occasioned bv them. A young man had the operation of paracentesis performed for ascites which had been produced by mercurv ; three quarts of water were evacuated ; this young man recovered. I do not mention it as an extraordinary case, either to show that mercury will produce dropsy, or that his recovery from ascites was extraordinary • but to point out to you the impropriety of tapping a person at so early a period of the disease, when the operation is attended with hazard, from the danger you run of wounding the viscera ; I do not consider a surgeon justified in performing the operation of paracentesis, when the collection of water is so small, as in this case, and more especially as ascites, when caused by debility, arising either from fever or mercury, is so generally and readily remediable by medical treatment. Diseases of the heart, lungs, and other organs, will likewise produce ascites, but when it results from affections of the two first mentioned organs, the disease is scarcely ever a.«cites alone, but is generally combined with hydrothorax ; it is very, very rare to see ascites as the effect of disease of the heart or lungs, without its being at the same time accompanied by hydrothorax.

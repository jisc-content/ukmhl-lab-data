ON SYPHILIS AND THE USE OF MERCURY. 5<j9 confidently asserting that it is syphilitic, yet, at the same time, there is often great difficulty in saying what is not so; for example, excoriations may exist on the glaiis, to which sy- philitic matter may have been applied, and the poison ma> have entered into the constitution through the medium ot those broken surfaces, without having time to produce in the sores themselves the true syphilitic character ; if, therefoie, a patient were to come to you under such circumstances, and after having had connexion vvith a suspicious person, il he were to inquire of you whether the sores were syphilitic oi not, you had better explain to him what I have just stated to you- and likewise tell him, that although the ulcers have not then the syphilitic aspect, yet that he may in reality be infect- ed, but that there has not been sufficient time for the parts to assume their peculiarly marked syphilitic character ; tell him to make his mind easy, watch the appearance of the paits, let him wait and see the result, without subjecting himself at all hazards to a course of mercury, for the cure of a disease which never required its employment. Mercury, itself, un- fortunately produces diseases very similar, both in appeal- aiice and effect, to syphilis. 1 recollect, at the commence- ment of my studies at these hospitals, one day, on going round the wards with a surgeon, haying been very much surprised to see mercury so indiscriminately employed, and at seeing every poor emaciated wretch continually rubbing in ; there wa.s one individual, I remember, in a dreadful state, who had been using mercury for a great length of time, and under which treatment he continued to get rather worse than better; in this case I took the liberty of suggest- ing the propriety of discontinuing the mercury, when, in a short time, the patient became completely cured. Mercury, in reality, when given injudiciously, or to excess, will some- times produce ulcers, which a man of little experience would .say were venereal. Again, in ulcerated sore throats, a care- less observer might mistake common ulcers for venereal ones; the former, however, are known to be superficial, and may generally be removed by ordinary purgatives, whereas, the latter are deep, with elevated edges, having the same appear- ance as chancres on the penis. 1 recollect a gentleman once coming to me, and standing before me as well as he could ; “ Pray, sir,” said he, “ what do you think is the matter with me.’” “ What?” said I, “ why, you are poxed up to the eyes j” seeing him in such a state, this was my involuntary reply, not the most elegant, certainly. 1 told him that he wa.s not then in a fit state to take mercury, being emaciated, and in a state of great irritability, and that he had better, for a

438 ON TIC DOULOUREUX, in keeping off the pain for the space of three or four months, about which time it appears that the nerve either re-uuiU-s, or that its branches anastomose with others. If you ask patients if they will submit to an operation, they answer, “ most cer- tainly—to any thing that will rid us of our present suf- fering.” If they enquire of you whether the operation will be attended with peruianent benefit, you should say that it is doubtful, but you rather think not. Indeed, the result of the operation is doubtful enough, for the pain will sometimes return almost immediately, but whether by the same nerve is questionable. A person came several times from Bury to un- dergo the operation, and the pain used to return before sensa- tion ; that is, a numbr.ess of a part of the cheek and upper lij' would still continue, notwithstanding the pain was as severe as ever ; the divided nerve in this case was the sub-orbitar ; well then, the division of the nerve does not always succeed in giving relief so long as one might have expected. If it should be deemed requisite to divide the .sub-orbitar nerve, it should be done a quarter of an inch below the orbit; the nerve passes out of the foramen half an inch below, so that you are to di- vide it mid-way between the foramen and the edge of the or- bit—if you divide it lower than this, you will leave some branches which will still continue the disease; the proper mode to adopt for dividing it is to introduce a sharp-pointed bistoury at the distance from the orbit already stated, and, car- rying the point of the instrument close upon the bone, yoji hook up the nerve on its edge, then press upon the skin over the edge with your finger, and at the same time withdraw the knife through the opening by which it entered ; in this wa) as you take out the knife the nerve will be divided ; you oucht to ask the patient if he feels a numbness of the upper lip, and if he should not, your operation wall be incomplete. When neces.sary, the supra-ovbitar branch is to be divided in a simi- lar manner, by introducing the knife under the integuments of the superciliary ridge, and cut through the nerve imme- diately as it emerges from the supra-orbitar foramen, carry the point of the knife from the nose outwards. When the submental nerve requires division, you need not make any incision tbrough tbe integuments, but may perform the operation by placing the knife within the mouth, and di- recting its point downwards, to the mental foramen, where the nerve passes out, and by gliding the knife along the bone at that part, the nerve is sure to be divided ; in performing this operation, you may direct your knife by the bicuspi- dati teeth, the anterior maxillary foramina being just below them.

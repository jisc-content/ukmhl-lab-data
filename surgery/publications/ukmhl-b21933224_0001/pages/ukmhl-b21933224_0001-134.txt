114 ANESTHETICS. of the throat, and used as a hook to draw forward the epiglottis and base of the tongue, and this has often a very marked effect, and should on no account be neglected. At the same time, anything in the shape of a foreign body can be felt for, and, if found, attempts may be made to remove it with the finger, or by means of the laryngeal forceps (Fig. 34). The throat must be sponged to get rid of the mucus and blood, and, if this be excessive, the patient may very gently be turned on one side. Fig. 35.—Ferguson's Mouth Gag. The toothplates must be protected with pieces of rubher tubing. Fig. 36.—Tongue Forceps. If a foreign body or definite obstruction can be felt, but cannot be removed with the finger or by means of the forceps, and if the asphyxia is becoming more intense, the question of tracheotomy may now arise, but mere feeble breathing, without definite signs of obstruction, is no indication for opening the trachea. It is absolutely essential to commence with the above three proceedings as preliminary to anything else that may be done; it is useless to attempt to force air into the chest, by artificial respiration or other means, unless we first assure ourselves that the air-passages are clear. Violent movement of the patient at this early stage may have no other result than that of shaking the last flicker of life out of his body; do not, therefore, be over hasty. If, after waiting for ten or fifteen seconds, we get no response to our efforts, the next steps are, (4) Make two or three momentary pressures upon the sternum; it may be that it is merely the rhythm of respiration which is in abeyance. (5) Invert the patient.—Children may be held up by the heels; with adults, an assistant standing on the table may hold up the legs, and the body of the patient may be pulled upwards, so that the head hangs over

In some cases no doubt several methods of treatment are of equal value, and while we have only discussed at length that which we have ourselves been led to adopt, we have referred shortly to the others. We have not mentioned all the exceptional conditions that may be met with, but we have endeavoured to include all the circumstances with which the surgeon is most commonly called upon to deal. The task has been one of some difficulty, the more so as we have had, to a certain extent, to break new ground. This must serve as our excuse for the.many shortcomings in the work. Our best thanks are due to Dr. Silk for much assistance in seeing this volume through the press, as well as for his contribution upon the adminis- tration of anaesthetics. We are also indebted to Messrs. Down Brothers for kindly placing at our disposal their very large collection of blocks illustrative of surgical instruments, to Messrs. H. K. Lewis for Fig. 63, to Messrs. Arnold for Fig. 64, to Messrs. Barth & Co. for Figs. 18 to 22, and to the Medical News of New York for Figs. 40 and 41. London, April, 1899.

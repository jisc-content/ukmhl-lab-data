CHAPTER V. ANESTHETICS. By Dr. J. FREDK. w. SILK. The two chief objects in placing a patient under an anaesthetic, are the abohtion of pain and the diminution of shock; of but sHghtly less importance, from the surgeon's point of view, are quietness and muscular relaxation. To attain these ends, a general anaesthetic, by which is meant the inhalation of some particular gas or vapour, is almost essential. Shock, quietness, and muscular relaxation are, no doubt, partly dependent upon the amount of pain inflicted, and in certain selected cases, therefore, local anaesthesia by means of hypodermic injections of cocaine, or the infiltra- tion method of Schleich, or freezing, may be sufficiently satisfactory. As far as our present knowledge goes, however, no method is at once so certain, so universally applicable, and so complete as that of general anaesthesia by inhalation. PART I. GENERAL ANiESTHESIA. Preliminary Observations. Preparation of the Patient.â€”With the possible exception of nitrous oxide (see p. 87), experience leads us to believe that an anaesthetic is always taken better if the patient has been subjected, for a few days, to what may be termed hospital regime. This does not of necessity mean absolute confinement to bed, but it implies rest of body and mind, careful regulation of the ordinary bodily functions, light and easily digested diet, abstention from alcohol, etc. Obviously, it is not always possible, nor even advisable, to submit every patient to such restraint; for instance, young children and highly neurotic adults are often best kept in ignorance of an impending operation, but such patients frequently give trouble under an anaesthetic, and so confirm the value of the general rule. It has been suggested that a course of some drug, such as strychnine, quinine, iron, etc., is a sure safeguard against some of the difficulties and

Before the cannula is tied in a piece of india-rubber tubing is attached to it, and to this is fitted a glass funnel, or the barrel of a glass syringe from which the piston has been removed, washed in carbolic acid, and then filled completely with salt solution and the tube clamped so as to expel all the air. Care must be taken that no air gets in at any time. The funnel is held from two to three feet above the level of the patient, the clamp is opened, and the fluid is allowed to flow gradually into the vein (see Fig. 43), care Fig. 43.â€”Transfusion. This shows the method of using the barrel of an ordinary glass syringe as a funnel. It is convenient in practice to have a clamp upon the india- rubber tube. There is a ligature shown in the illustration upon the distal side of the incision in the vein, the one on the pro.\imal side serving to tie m the cannula. being taken that the fluid in the funnel is replenished before it has quite run away, as otherwise air may get in when a fresh supply of the fluid is poured in. The rapidity of the flow can be easily controlled by raising the funnel more or less above the level of the heart j this can be better regulated by means of a funnel than if the saline solution be injected by means of a syringe. The amount introduced should be from one to three pints. The condition of the patient has to be carefully watched during its introduction. If it enter too rapidly, the fluid that is driven from the heart into the lungs may consist of pure salt solu- tion, and consequently signs of imperfect aeration of the blood at once become evident; the respiration becomes embarrassed, and twitchings

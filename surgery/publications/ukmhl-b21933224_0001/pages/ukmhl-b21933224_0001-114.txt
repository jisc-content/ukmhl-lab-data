94 ANESTHETICS. For the sake of convenience of description, it is usual to divide the process of anaesthetisation into four stages, but, of course, it must be under- stood, that this arrangement is somewhat artificial ; clinically, the different stages merge into and overlap one another, and are not equally well defined A Fig. 21.—Sectional View of Ormsby's Ether Inhaler. B, Padded facepiece, at the apex of which is fitted a wire cage (dotted line), for holding the sponge upon which the ether is poured. Over this cage and its contained sponge a lai'ge india-rubber bag, A, is fitted. At C is an arrangement which admits of a certain amount of regulation of the air-supply. in every case. These stages are:—First, the stage of confusion of ideas, with subjective sensations of dizziness, tingling of the extremities, etc.; second, the stage of excitement and more or less struggling; third, the stage of ancBsthesia, with flaccidity of the limbs, slow movements of the eyeballs from side to side, abolition of the conjunctival and other super- ficial reflexes, but the deeper reflexes are retained, so that there is still the power of coughing and swallowing, and, when the skin incisions are made the muscles are apt to be thrown into spasm; the fourth stage is char- acterized by more markedly stertorous breathing, dilated pupils, fixation of eyeballs, and abolition of all reflexes, both superficial and deep. As a general rule, the fourth, or most profound degree of anaesthesia, is kept up only until the primary incisions have been made, after which the patient may be allowed to fall back to the third degree; but in cases where con siderable shock is to be anticipated, as in operations upon the abdomen, on the large joints, in the genito-urinary areas, etc., it is of great importance that the anaesthesia should be maintained fairly deeply throughout.

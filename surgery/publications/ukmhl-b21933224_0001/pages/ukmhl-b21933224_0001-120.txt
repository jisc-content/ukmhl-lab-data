ANESTHETICS. 100 dental position. When chloroform is inhaled the patient should always be recumbent. Apparatus and Administration.—The simplest way to administer chloro- form, and at the same time ensure a sufificient supply of air, is to sprinkle it drop by drop by means of a suitable drop-bottle (Fig. 25), on to the out- side of a folded towel (Fig. 24), or on to a handkerchief, or, better still, on to a piece of domette stretched tightly over a metal frame (Skinner's Fig. 24.—Towel folded for the Administration of Chloroform. Fig. 25.—Graduated Drop-Bottle with Hollow Stopper. Fig. 26.—Skinner's Frame. Inhaler), Fig. 26. Personally, I strongly object to the use of lint, the woolly surface of which quickly becomes sodden, and renders the equable distribution of the vapour almost impossible. By some, the Junker's Inhaler (Fig. 27) is preferred. The principle of this apparatus is simply that of blowing air through a layer of liquid chloro- form by means of a hand-bellows, the mixture of air and vapour being conveyed to a facepiece. Variations in the strength of the vapour are determined by the force and frequency with which the bellows are pressed. Care must be taken that the liquid chloroform does not more than half fill the bottle, and that the bellows-tube and the exit-tube are fitted to their respective metal connections. Fatal accidents have occurred from neglecting these points, as liquid chloroform is then poured into the patient's mouth.

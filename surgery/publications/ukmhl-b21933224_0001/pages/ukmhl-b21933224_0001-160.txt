Fig. 44.â€”Hot-Water Operating Table. The hot water circulates through the tubes, of which the entrance and exit taps are shown. The cover above serves to diffuse the heat uniformly. This form of table has the great advantage that the pelvis can be raised {e.g. when Trendelenburg's position is required) without interfering with the hot- water circulation. Of the very greatest value in the prevention or diminution of shock is the administration of strychnine before the commencement of the operation. In the case of an adult, a thirtieth of a grain should be injected sub- cutaneously just before the operation, or while the patient is being placed under the anaesthetic; and during the course of the operation, if the pulse is beginning to fail, a second injection of a sixtieth of a grain may be administered. It is of the greatest importance to give the strychnine before the occurrence of shock, for when shock is once established remedies are of little avail, and recovery mainly depends on the patient's recupera- tive power. Death occurs partly from the severity of the shock (the nerve centres being unable to regain their power) and partly from its duration. Where the depression is long continued, and the circulation consequently extremely feeble, clots are apt to form in the pulmonary artery, and recovery is then out of the question.

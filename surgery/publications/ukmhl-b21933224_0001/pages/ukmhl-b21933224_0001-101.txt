CANCRUM ORIS. 8l the raw surface. This is best done by means of a stout glass rod or a glass brush. The acid is allowed to act for about ten minutes, fresh applications being repeatedly made during that time. When the surgeon is thoroughly satisfied that every portion of the disease is destroyed, the action of the acid is arrested by the application of a saturated solution of carbonate of soda, which is poured on the part until the acid is completely neutralized, as is shown when bubbles of carbonic acid gas cease to form. Anything short of this , treatment will fail in arresting the disease. To leave the sloughs on the surface and to apply antiseptic washes or strong antiseptics to them is absolutely useless, for the regions in which the organisms are growing are the living tissues just beyond the actually dead parts, and these cannot be reached unless the slough be first removed. The part should then be powdered with iodoform, and full-strength boracic ointment spread on butter-cloth applied with boracic lint outside it. The mouth or vagina should be washed out with sanitas and water (about i part in 12) several times a day. The wound will begin to granulate in five or six days, and then the weaker boracic ointment may be substituted.

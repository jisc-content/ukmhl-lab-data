TUMOURS. 2/2 by obstruction of pre-existing canals or by degenerative changes. Cysts may be unilocular or multilocular, and are found in the ovary and in the breast. In the ovary, multilocular cysts form large tumours generally composed of one or two very large cysts, and numbers of smaller ones. The walls are smooth and shining, the contents a clear fluid or a turbid, glairy material; papillary outgrowths are not uncommonly present in their interior. The cysts of the breast are similar in character, but smaller, while the intra-cystic growth may be more markedly developed. The whole subject of ovarian and mammary cysts will be dealt with under diseases of those organs. Other cysts are met with as the result of degeneration in tumours; or again they may be due to the dilatation of previously existing cavities, such as sebaceous cysts, hydro-nephrosis, hydroceles, etc., but these cannot be classed as true tumours. Complex Tumours.â€”Lastly we have complex tumours, which may be solid or cystic, which are congenital and which generally contain a variety of tissues. These complex tumours are most frequently met with over the sacrum, forming the sacro-coccygeal tumours, and in them may be found a variety of structures, such as bone, connective tissue, muscle, nerves, cartilage, epithelium, etc., cysts also are often present. Another form of congenital complex tumour is the dermoid cyst, the lining wall of which is composed of structures resembling skin, containing the skin glands as well as hairs, and often teeth and even bone. They occur in the ovary and in various parts where epithelial structures may have been included during development, more particularly in the neck in connection with the branchial clefts and about the root of the nose or the angular process of the frontal bone. The treatment of these tumours will be referred to when we treat of the affections of the organs in which they occur.

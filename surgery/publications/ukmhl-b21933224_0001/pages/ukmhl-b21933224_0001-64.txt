44 ULCERATION. applied from below upwards, the centre of each strip being applied at the point opposite the centre of the ulcer, so that as the two ends are brought together over the limb they pull together the edges of the ulcer (see Fig. ii). If the strips are applied with the centre over the ulcer, the reverse will be the case; when they are pulled tight the edges of the ulcer will be separated. The strips should overlap each other for about two-thirds of their breadth, so that only about a third of each is exposed. In this way, by a series of strips of adhesive plaster applied from below upwards, the whole region of the ulcer, as well as the thickened tissues above and below, are firmly supported and pressed upon. Before applying the strapping the whole limb should be shaved, as otherwise a great deal of annoyance is caused to the patient when it is peeled off. Fig. II.â€”Strapping an Ulcer. To show how the plaster should be applied in order to bring the edges of the ulcer together as much as possible. The dotted line indicates the extent of the ulcer (over which a dressing is applied). One great objection to strapping is that the discharge from the ulcer is confined beneath it, and there undergoes decomposition, with the result that fresh ulceration occurs from the presence of this chemically irritating material. Of course, at the present time, one would naturally disinfect the ulcer before applying the strapping, and then place over its surface an antiseptic dressing, such as boracic lint, so as to absorb the fluids and prevent their decomposition. If this be not done it will be necessary to cut away the strapping at the lower part, so as to allow the discharge to escape, a procedure which necessarily weakens it. The strapping ought to be renewed every day or two. It is well to renew it daily if the discharge is at all profuse.

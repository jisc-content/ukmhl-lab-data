ANAESTHETICS. 88 anaesthetizing power, it is difficult to maintain the narcosis for any length of time, and practically, therefore, its administration is limited to cases in which the available anaesthesia which follows the single application of the facepiece will suffice. On an average, this represents between 30 and 40 seconds, but, with a little careful manipulation and an occasional supply of air, provided that the operation is not upon the mouth, this time can easily be doubled or trebled. But even in this short space of time much can be done, and, as the profession becomes more familiar with the drug, its field of usefulness will be found to be more extensive than is generally supposed. Another objection to it is, that the relaxation of the muscles is usually very transitory, and, when the inhalation is pushed, there may be actual spasm ; in moving stiff joints, therefore, it is of importance not to continue the inhalation for too long a time without admitting air.

A, Steel bottles containing compressed gas in liquid form; j5, Reservoir bag; £, Facepiece; C, Three-way stop-cock containing inspiratory and expiratory valves ; J^, Footpiece for regulating escape of gas from ihe bottles into the reservoir bag. Apparatus and Administration.—To ensure the complete exclusion of air, the somewhat complicated apparatus, shown and described in Fig. 18, is used. The bag B being filled with gas, the administrator stands either behind or on the left side of the patient, and carefully adjusts the face- piece £ to the irregularities of the face. Being satisfied that there is no air leakage, the stop-cock C is turned on half-way; the nitrous oxide is then inspired from the bag, and expired through the valves contained in the stop-cock into the open air.

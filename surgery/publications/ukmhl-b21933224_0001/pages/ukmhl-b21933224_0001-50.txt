30 ACUTE SUPPURATION. right through the whole of the inflamed area. If one incision does not suffice to lay the whole of it open, additional ones must be made till the entire area is incised; in any case it should expose the deep fascia of the part, and must go even deeper if necessary. After the incisions have been made, the part should be gently squeezed, and any recesses from which pus wells out should be thoroughly opened. When the surgeon is satisfied that all the recesses have been opened, extremely satisfactory results are often obtained from sponging the surface of the wound with undiluted carbolic acid, with the view of destroying the micro-organisms if possible. When the wound has been thus treated, it should be stuffed with strips of cyanide gauze wrung out of a 1-2000 sublimate solution and sprinkled with iodoform, and then the ordinary anti- septic dressing applied outside (see Chap. VIII.). After-treatment.—Where, in spite of this treatment, the process does not come to a standstill, resort should be had to constant irrigation or the employment of the water bath, fresh incisions being made from time to time over any area showing signs of extension of the inflammation. To carry out irrigation the first point to remember is that whatever apparatus is used to convey the fluid, it must not allow the latter to drop on to the wound, as this would cause intolerable pain in a very short time. If a tube be employed, the end of it must lie upon the skin at the highest point of the wound. Perhaps the simplest and best plan is to convey the fluid to the wound by means of capillary action. A vessel containing the lotion is placed at a higher level than the part, and a strand of worsted, I? Fig. 6.—Con.stant Irrigation uy means of a strand of worsted. The method of arranging the mackintosh so as to drain off the fluid is also shown.

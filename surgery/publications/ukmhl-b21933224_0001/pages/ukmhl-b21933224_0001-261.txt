CHANCROID OR SOFT SORE. 241 cavity thoroughly, and washing it out. Some iodoform emulsion (see p. 249) should be injected and a small strand of horsehair or a %hred of gauze laid between the edges of the wound, so as to allow of the escape of the discharge, and then outside the first few layers of the cyanide gauze dressing, firm pressure is made, either by sponges or a pad of gauze or salicylic wool kept in place by a spica bandage reinforced by elastic webbing (see p. 170); this obliterates the abscess cavity by bringing its walls well into contact everywhere. This is important, since the organism being aerobic, it is thus deprived of its due supply of air much more effectually than if a drainage tube were inserted; its growth is therefore much more readily brought to a stand still. Great care must be taken in the antiseptic management of these cases, and the drain must not be left out until suppuration has entirely ceased. Where the abscess has burst and a chancroid surface is left, the skin around must be purified and the surface of the sore cauterised with nitric acid in a manner similar to that described for the primary sore. Afterwards cyanide gauze dressings and wool should be used until the ulcer has become healthy and superficial, when weak boracic ointment may be substituted. Q

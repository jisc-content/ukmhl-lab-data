WOUNDS. 156 them. The portions grasped by the forceps are then cut off, and the wire is ready for use. If the suppleness has been lost, it can be immedi- ately restored by passing the wire through the flame of a spirit lamp. Fig. 47.—Methoo of Threading Lister's Needle with Wire. The needle is shown grasped at the extreme end by a pair of dressing forceps. The forceps held in one hand serve to fix the needle and to flatten the wire into its groove while the wire is care- fully twisted up with the fingers of the other hand. The twists should always be close and regular, as in the figure, or they will be liable to catch in the skin. In order to fix wire stitches ot this kind, if the tension be not very great, the first half of a reef knot should be tied, the ends turned up at - i Fig. 48.—Method of Suturing a Wound where there is much Tension on THE Edges. On either side is a pair of button sutures, showing the figure-of-eight arrangement by which the wire is fastened. In the centre is a relaxation stitch of stout silver wire showing the manner in which the wire is tied and its ends clipped off. A con- tinuous " button-hole " stitch unites the edges of the skin which, by the aid of the button sutures and the silver wire stitch, come together without tension. The puckering of the skin caused liy the tension upon the button sutures and silver wire stitch is also indicated. The .sicin has been freely undermined. right angles, and then clipped off flush with the surface of the wire (see Fig. 48); if the wire be stout, this will hold perfectly well, while

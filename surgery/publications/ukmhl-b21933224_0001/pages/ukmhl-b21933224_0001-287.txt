TUMOURS COMPOSED OF THE MORE COMPLEX TISSUES. 267 In large ngevi both poles may be buried in the tumour, the negative pole being attached to a single needle insulated as described above, which is. Fig. 63.—Methods of inserting the Needles in Electrolysis of a N-evus. The upper figure shows the proper method, viz. where the needles are kept parallel^ and the current is uniformly diffused over a large area, and therefore produces uniform results. In the lower figure the needles are in an improper position, the current being concentrated at the centre of the tumour, which is therefore likely to slough, while the periphery will hardly be acted upon at all. (Lewis Jones.) also pushed into the swelling. For this purpose the handle figured below (see Fig. 64) is specially useful. The strength of the current should be from 40 to 80 milliamperes, but, where three or four needles are used, 20 to 25 will suffice. The current should be continued for about ten minutes; Fic. 64.—Bipolar Fork Electrode. From two to five needles can be screwed into the h.-indle. They are so .-irranged as to be alternately positive and negative, the method of insulation being shown in the smaller figure. (Lewis Jones ) the best criterion as to when to discontinue it is perhaps that the nsevus- is felt to become firm. Before withdrawing the needles the current should be reversed for a few seconds, as otherwise those connected with the positive pole adhere firmly to the tissues and bleeding results from their withdrawal; this is however not of any real moment, very slight pressure being always sufficient to check it.

ANAESTHETICS. PROLONGED NITROUS OXIDE ANESTHESIA.—Various plans have, from time to time, been suggested for increasing the ancesthelising power of the gas. In operations not involving the mouth or nose, the anaesthesia may often be much prolonged by allowing the patient an occasional breath of air directly the twitching appears. In dental and other mouth cases, the supply of nitrous oxide may be maintained by means of a cap fitted over the nose, as suggested by Coleman and Patterson, or a tube may be passed into the mouth, or down Fig. 19.—Hewitt's Apparatus for the Administration op Nitrous Oxide AND Oxygen. /4, Steel cylinders containing compressed oxygen and liquid nitrous oxide ; F, A double tube, one within the other, conveying the respective gases (O and N2O) to the double reservoir bag B and D ; C, Stop-cock by which oxygen is allowed to pass through minute holes at the same time that the nitrous oxide is turned on ; E, Facepiece. the nose, and connected with the reservoir bag, as proposed by Hillier and Coxon.^ Adopting the view that the lividity, muscular twitching, and some of the other phenomena are indications of asphyxia, or more properly speaking, of oxygen starvation, and assuming that these phenomena are always objectionable, ^ See Transactions of the Society of AncEsthetists, vol. i., 1898.

124 ANESTHETICS. In using these solutions, great stress is laid upon the technique of the proceeding. The essence of the process consists in raising a series of small wheals or bubbles under and around the area of operation; for each succeeding wheal, the point of the injecting syringe is inserted within the margin of that which immediately precedes it.^ Fig. 40.—^Anaesthesia by Infiltration (Schleich). Needle introduced at some distance from the area to be operated upon, and made to pierce the true skin. Fig. 41.—Anesthesia by Infiltration (Schleich). Showing how the bubbles of liquid overlap, and are made to surround the affected area. Excellent as this -plan has no doubt proved in the hands of Dr. Schleich and his followers, it will be seen at once that it does not over- come many of the difficulties and objections made to local anaesthesia in general, under the head of " Preliminary Observations" at the beginning of this section. It is claimed for it that, as the process can be repeated without risk as often as may be required, it is quite possible to conduct an elaborate and lengthy operation by this method; but, on the other hand, it is obviously objectionable to break off an operation in the middle for the purpose of making a fresh series of injections, while the oedema produced renders any operation very difificult, and dissection almost im- possible. 1 For Figs. 40 and 41, illustrating the details of this method, we are indebted to the Medical Neivs of New Yoj-k.

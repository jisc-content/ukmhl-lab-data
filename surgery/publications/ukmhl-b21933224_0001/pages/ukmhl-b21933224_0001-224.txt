204 WOUNDS. advisable to wait for a line of demarcation. It is not uncommon to find that, after all, the slough only involves the skin and subcutaneous tissues, or even only the surface of the skin, and by waiting a little it may turn out that amputation is not called for. In any case, there is no guide to the proper place for amputation till some sort of line of demarcation has formed, for it is impossible to say at first to what extent the tissues have been so damaged by the cold as to cause their death. As soon, however, as there is a clear indication of the extent of the frost-bite, there is no necessity to wait any longer, and amputation may be at once proceeded with. In most cases of frost-bite of the foot, a Chopart's or Syme's ampu- tation will suffice: it is seldom that the gangrene reaches the ankle. If, however, the surgeon wait too long, the gangrene is apt to spread (as is the case with the senile form), the weak tissues being unable to resist the inflammation associated with the separation of the dead part. On the other hand, if the amputation be performed antiseptically, no further inflam- mation occurs, and there is no gangrene of the flaps. Thus, by waiting too long, more tissue may be lost than if the amputation were performed as soon as the appearance of a line of demarcation indicates the extent of the original gangrene. The general treatment of the third stage of frost-bite is the same as that of the less severe forms (see p. 203).

I20 ANESTHETICS. freezing are those which do not involve any large area of surface, but which only require a short, simple incision or puncture, e.g. opening a superficial abscess. The method is open to the special objections that the tissues are apt to become so hard, that it is sometimes difficult to cut through them, so no dissecting operation can be carried out; and that the process of thawing is often accompanied by much pain, the healing is retarded, and the tissues are liable to slough. A simple plan is to employ a mixture of two parts of pounded ice to one of salt. This is placed in an india-rubber bag, and laid upon the part to be operated upon until the latter assumes a dead-white colour, and is frozen hard. This plan is hardly to be recommended in any case; too large an area is frozen, and there is a great tendency for the parts to slough. The late Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson was a great advocate for freezing anaesthesia, and introduced the ether spray (Fig. 37). The ether used for this purpose is the methylated ether, and is often known as Fig. 37.â€”Ether Spray. a minule stream of liquid out of the orifice. "anaesthetic ether"; it should have a spec. grav. of 717 or under. The nozzle of the spray is held a few inches away from the part to be frozen, so that the liquid falls in a fine shower upon the surface; in about two minutes the skin becomes hard and white, and the incision may then be made. A very convenient adaptation of this principle of freezing by evaporation is seen in the use of tubes containing ethyl chloride, anaestile, and other fluids of low boiling point (Fig. 38). In these tubes, the heat of the hand suffices to drive a stream of the liquid through a minute hole in the nozzle, and at a distance of a few inches the jet is broken up into a fine spray, and the part upon which this spray falls is quickly frozen. These substances appear to be rather more rapid in action than pure ether, to

COMBINED METHOD. 97 completion of the operation. For a more detailed reference to after- treatment see p. 116. Nitrous Oxide and Ether Combined.—The so-called combined METHOD is the plan of inducing anaisthesia with nitrous oxide, and main- taining the narcosis with ether (nitrogenizing the ether). The procedure is as follows, viz.:—If the Clover's inhaler be used, the three-way tube and bag of the nitrous oxide apparatus are substituted for the smaller ether-bag (Fig. 22). Fig. 22.—Clovkr's Portable Ether Apparatus, fitted for Nitrous Oxide AND Ether combined. A, Steel gas bottles; B, Reservoir b.ig; C, Three-way stop- cock connecting gas bag ; V, Ether chamber; £, Facepiece. About half a dozen full respirations of the nitrous oxide are allowed, and then the ether vapour is cautiously admitted by rotating the ether chamber. Wlien once the ether is tolerated, the increase in the strength of the vapour may be much greater, and made at shorter intervals than when ether alone is being administered. When irregular stertor and twitching of the muscles appear, the nitrous oxide must all be pressed out of the bag, and a breath or two of air given, or perhaps a better plan is to change the large for the smaller bag at this stage. If the Ormsby's inhaler be used for the ether, the patient is first antesthetised with G

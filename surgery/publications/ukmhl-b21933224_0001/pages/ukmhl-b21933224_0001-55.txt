DIFFUSE CELLULITIS. 35 with the view of breaking down adhesions in the joints and between tendons. In bad cases, this passive movement may be undertaken two or three times a week under an anaesthetic, but care must be taken not to do too much at a time, as otherwise fresh effusion is caused, and the object of the procedure is defeated. General Treatment.â€”The general treatment of diffuse cellulitis must be very carefully attended to. As has already been said, it is a very grave disease, and the patient is very apt to pass into the typhoid state, hence free stimulation is above all things necessary, and perhaps the best stimulant to employ is brandy. Where the patient, however, is very much exhausted, champagne will, at any rate temporarily, have a better effect. If brandy be given, at least six ounces should be administered in the twenty- four hours, and in some cases where the pulse is very weak, a considerably larger amount may be necessary. Strychnine injected hypodermically is also of great value. Every attempt should be made to promote the patient's nourishment, and this must be carried out on the lines already laid down for the treatment of acute inflammation (see p. 13). Diffuse cellulitis in certain situations, e.g. scalp, neck, etc., will be treated of in their appropriate places. The essential facts to remember with regard to diffuse cellulitis in general are the rapidity of the disease, the necessity for very early surgical intervention, and the desirability of extremely thorough measures. As a matter of fact, one is much more likely to do too little than too much in the way of free incisions into the part.

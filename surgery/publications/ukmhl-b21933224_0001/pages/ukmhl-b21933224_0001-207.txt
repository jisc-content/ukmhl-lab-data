WOUNDS ALREADY SEPTIC. 187 for necrosis, it is best to stuff the wound from the first with cyanide gauze, and then to apply the ordinary gauze dressing outside. Unless this be done, the opening in the skin is likely to close so rapidly that the dis- charge from the deeper parts does not escape freely, and healing cannot occur; besides this, the irritation of the gauze leads to unduly rapid growth of granulations, which thus fill up the wound. Under these circumstances, the external dressing should be changed on the day following the operation, and subsequently as often as the amount of discharge present may require. The stuffing should not, however, be removed unless it be quite loose; it should be gently pulled upon at each dressing and any loose portions cut away, but where the wound remains aseptic it may be two or three weeks before it can all be removed. After the loose portion has been cut off, a little fresh gauze should be laid on the remaining stuffing so as to fill up the cavity. Should the wound become septic, the stuffing comes away quite readily, and it should then be renewed daily until the cavity is almost entirely filled up. There is always great trouble with the opening in the skin, which constantly tends to close and leave a narrow sinus leading into a comparatively large cavity. Where it is evident that a long time must elapse before a cavity can fill up, it is a good plan to cut away a consider- able portion of the skin around the margin of the opening at the time of the operation; any overhanging portion should always be cut away, as it would only become inverted and delay healing. There is sometimes a good deal of trouble caused by inversion of the edges of the skin during the progress of healing, and if this occurs a little cocaine may be injected (see p. 121), and the inverted portion cut away. When the granulations are near the surface, the stuffing should be given up, and weak boracic ointment substituted.

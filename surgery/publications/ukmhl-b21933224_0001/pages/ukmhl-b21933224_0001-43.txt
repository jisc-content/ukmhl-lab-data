CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, 23 General Treatment.â€”The constitutional treatment in chronic inflamma- tion will depend rather on the disease which is at the bottom of the process than on the process itself. It is of course very essential that the patient should be put under the best possible hygienic conditions, and that he should have plenty of fresh air. Food of the most nourishing character should be ordered, and, in cases where the patient is weakly, stimulants should be administered. As regards medicines, the usual remedies for gout, rheumatism, syphilis, etc., may be employed as required. Even in some cases not due to syphilis, iodide of potassium and mercury are administered in small doses, but as a rule these do not then produce any marked effect. To sum up, therefore, we have the following means at our disposal in the treatment of chronic inflammation, viz. : the removal, or at least the appropriate treatment, of the cause; then rest, position, counter-irritation, free incisions, pressure, massage, and general treatment. Of these latter, rest, position, and good hygiene and nourishing food are essential in all cases. Of the various other methods free incisions, made aseptically, are the most certain and speedy, but in many cases they may not be necessary or advisable. Under such circumstances, resort may be had to counter- irritation, or, if the inflammation is not very active, to the use of pressure. In very inactive cases, or during subsidence of the trouble, pressure and massage are of great value.

237 HEREDITARY SYI'HILIS. of a grain of bichloride of mercury well diluted may be given three or four times a day. The hydrarg. cum cret. may usefully be combined with bicarbonate of soda in the proportion of one grain of the former to five of the latter; one grain of this is given three or four times a day to an infant. The bichloride of mercury may be given in the form of liq. hydrag. perchlor. flavoured with aq. anethi or aq. chloroformi. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to attend to the proper feeding of the child. In prescribing iodide of potassium, the dose will vary with the child's age. Dr. Lauder Brunton's plan of calculating the dose for different ages is very simple and efficacious. He takes the age for the full adult dose as 25, and reckons the age of the child at its next birthday as an integral part of that number; the full adult age is used as the denominator, and the child's age thus reckoned is used as the numerator. Thus, the dose for a child in the first year of life would be -/^th of the adult dose, that for a child one year old, Truths of the adult dose, and so on. Where the syphilis has not appeared, or at any rate has not been treated with mercury, in infancy, it is well to employ mercurial inunction in addition to the iodide of potassium which will be required in the later manifestations of the disease.

DIFFUSE CELLULITIS. 31 one end of which hangs in the lotion, while the other lies on the upper part of the wound, is employed : the fluid runs along these threads very quickly, and the wound is thus constantly washed with it (see Fig. 6). The liquid used for irrigation should be at about the temperature of the body, and this can be arranged for by keeping a night-light under the vessel in which it is. It is well to add some antiseptic, but it is important to avoid those Fig. 7.â€”Constant Irrigation. The method of forming a drain for the surplus fluid by means of the mackintosh is also shown. The nozzle of the irrigator should always lie, as represented above, in direct contact with the edge of the sore. which precipitate albumen; otherwise the surface of the sore will become coated with a layer of coagulated albumen, and the pus and organisms will accumulate beneath it instead of being washed away. Perhaps the best for the purpose are permanganate of potash or sanitas (a teaspoonful of sanitas to the tumbler of water, or two to four grains of permanganate of potash to the ounce).

If possible, it is well to have the limb suspended over an empty vessel, but in any case a piece of mackintosh should be arranged beneath it.

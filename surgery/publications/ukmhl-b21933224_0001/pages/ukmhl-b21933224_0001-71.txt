TREATMENT OF ULCERS IN GENERAL. 51 layer of granulations and not to go through the deeper one of newly formed fibrous tissue into the fat. A surface is thus left which is smooth, highly vascular, and firm, and consists of the deeper layers of granulation tissue which have already become organized into fibrous tissue (see Fig. 13). In ulcers on the lower extremity, it is also of the greatest importance to remove those portions of the edge which have already become covered with new epithelium. One is tempted to limit the skin-grafting to the parts actually unhealed, but if this be done the result will, as a rule, be very dis- appointing, for, while the part that has been grafted remains perfectly sound, the margin where spontaneous healing had occurred is very likely to break Fig. 14.â€”Thiersch's Method of Skin-grafting. Cutting the grafts. To show how the parts are steadied while the grafts are being cut. down, and thus a narrow line of ulceration appears later on at the site of the edge of the ulcer. Having then removed the layer of granulations in the manner described, and cut away the newly healed edge of the ulcer (as shown in Fig. 13), the next thing is to arrest the bleeding completely before applying the grafts. This is best done by pressure, but, if pressure be applied directly to the sore either by sponges or dressings, it will be found that the bleeding begins again when they are removed, because they stick to the raw surface. The best plan is to interpose a piece of protective (see p. 47), which prevents adhesion of the sponges to the sore and thus avoids a renewal of the bleeding on removal. Hence, when the scraping and cutting are finished, any spouting vessel is clamped, and a large piece of protective dipped in the 1-2000 sublimate solution is applied over the raw surface. Outside this several sponges are placed, and a bandage

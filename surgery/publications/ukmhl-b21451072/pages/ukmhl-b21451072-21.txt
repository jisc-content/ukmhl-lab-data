19 clerks, with great accuracy, record the cases on their admission; and also, in which reports are almost daily- engrossed with the prescription, enabling you at your leisure to copy out whatever is interesting- and lay up in store what, in after life, may prove of great value. All the medical boards of the kingdom, as well as the Directors of this Hospital, have been most anxious to secure your attendance, both in the wards as well as at the regular Clinical lecture; and many have been the attempts to attain this desirable object;—at one time by calling the catalogue, at another by handing in your cards, and, at a third, by inscribing your names in the album ; but unfortunately all these laudable attempts have proved abortive : and why ? because, in my opinion, they are not criteria of your knowledge of what is transacting ;—true, they may be tests of your bodily presence ; but unless some- thing more is ascertained, all such contrivances are, in my opinion, absurd. The plan which I have uniformly adopted, is one which not only secures your bodily but your mental presence, and which is so satisfactory to all parties that I still intend to persevere in it. At the termination of each quarter I examine all those pupils, whose names are inscribed in my list, on the nature and treatment of the cases which have been admitted. This concours is con- ducted in such a manner as to be more a test of your attendance than an exhibition of your intellectual powers; and by such means I am enabled to note the diligent, and thus to grant certificates which in after life may be of much consequence to you all.

9 localities, so much the more will it be found that the Glasgow Royal Infirmary presents at all times perhaps the most important gallery of acute surgical disease of any in the world. But it may be said, that it is not to the quality of the cases, or their acuteness, as illustrative of surgical disease, so much as to the number and variety under the pupil's observation, that we must attend. And, in a qualified sense, I grant the truth of this remark; for it has ever been my opinion, that the larger the exhibition, provided the cases are equally interesting, so much the more is it to the advantage of the student. Unfortunately, however, in mj investigations on this subject, I have discovered that in proportion to the largeness of the gallery, so do the cases diminish in interest. In illustration of what I have here advanced, I may ver}^ shortly allude to the condition of a few of the largest hospitals in the world,—those of Vienna, Hamburgh, and Berlin. Without animadverting on the locality of the Hospital at Vienna—of which 7 could say much— there is no establishment, either at home or abroad, which I have seen, so ill-constructed in regard to ventilation, consisting as it does of a succession of six small quadrangular courts surrounded with buildings, three, and some of them four, stories in height, and without the slightest attempt at archi- tectural beauty or convenient interior arrange- ment.

22 De quite out of place for me to say one single word as to the advantages which you will derive from attending any of the three schools of medicine in this city contrasted with those elsewhere. They have all been long established, and I feel convinced the more they are known, the more highly will they be valued. As to my own department. Anatomy, I can with the utmost confidence affirm, that we stand on a vantage-ground in regard to dissection, possessed by no other locality in the empire; and were our capabilities better understood, Glasgow would soon occupy the first position as a school of practical science. In my Inaugural Lecture on Anatomy w^iich I published last year, I stated a great variety of other privileges which you enjoyed in studying your pro- fession in this city, and to it I must refer for any further information on this important subject; re- marking, in conclusion, that the more Glasgow is examined, and the more its capabilities for the prosecution of the study of medical science in all its extent are understood, so much the more I feel con- vinced will it rise in the estimation of the profession.

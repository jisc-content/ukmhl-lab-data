M. S. BUCHANAN. TO THE SURGICAL PUPILS ATTENDING THE GLASGOW ROYAL INFIRMARY. Gentlemen, The Glasgow Royal Infirmary is still so little known and appreciated, as a practical school of Medicine and Surgery, that I have felt it my duty, as senior surgeon, and about a third time to retire by the regulations of this House from my labours, to proclaim its advantages more extensively than heretofore, by publishing the introductory remarks which I addressed to you at the commencement of this Session. Having visited all the largest and most celebrated hospitals in Europe during the last 25 years, it cannot, I hope, be deemed presumptuous that I should institute comparisons which may tend to the advantage of our own establishment, and by this means place it on a more stable foundation in public estimation than it has ever previously enjoyed. If such shall be the result of this investigation, the labour which I have bestowed in its prosecution shall not have passed unrewarded. Meantime, with best wishes for your future success, believe me. Yours sincerely,

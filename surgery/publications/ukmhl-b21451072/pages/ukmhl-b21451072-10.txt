Now, if we contrast these classes with the engineers, miners, mechanics, and general oper- atives who compose the largest portion of the population of this city and surrounding country, we shall not be surprised at the difference in the quality of their respective hospital cases. In the first, I found chronic diseases in all their varieties almost exclusively to occupy their surgical wards—affections of the joints, ulcers, scrofulous abscesses, &c., mon- opolize their hospitals. And so strikingly was this the case in the hospitals of the capitals of Saxony and Bavaria—both schools of Practical Surgery— that on my inquiring, when visiting them last summer, for their accident wards, I was told that no such divi- sion of their Surgical Hospital had been ever contem- plated ; and so destitute were they of acute cases that not a single fracture nor stump could be shown me.

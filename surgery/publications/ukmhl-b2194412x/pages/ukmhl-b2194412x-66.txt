2. The ultimate loss to the effective strength in the different classes of wounds, and the scale in which that loss decreases from the 1st to the 6th month after an action. The tabular returns of the whole of the wounded, and of those resulting from the two principal actions, give these re- sults for the first month concisely. They fully confirm Mr. Guthrie's estimate as to the ultimate loss, being 1 in 3, that is, between a third and a fourth of the total number treated. The rate in which the loss after an action decreases in each succeeding month after the first, taking the ave- rage upon the whole number of 1350, is as follows:— Return to Duty. Of uumber treated. Return to Duty. Of total number treated. In the 1st month 1 in 5 By the end of 1st month 1 in 6 2nd , • 1 in 4 2nd . • lin2f|^ 13rd . . 1 in 7 lit 3rd . , . linlfi 4th , , . 1 in 36 4th . .

In the actions which gave the greatest num- ber of wounded, May 5, 1836, and March 10, 14, 15 and 16, 1837, the proportion in the three first months vary consi- derably. Number May 5th, 382.

75 of vein, and never extending into the vena cava; either no vis- ceral inflammation or very slight; or if the case terminated favourably the same phenomena in the first periods of the case were present. Sometimes the stump presented an unhealthy and sympathising action, but at others the healing process went on favourably even to the last. This train of symptoms, febrile, absorbent, and disorganising, is not common in second- ary amputation, and almost invariably, when it supervenes, is of a milder type, and seldom beyond control. Some of the most striking cases in which these facts were observed, may be given hereafter: in the meantime, as they accumulated under my eye, I was insensibly led, after close investigation of all collateral circumstances, to the con- clusion, that the symptoms developed were dependent upon the reactive power of the nervous system, highly and injuriously irritated by the double and quickly succeeding shock of the original injury and subsequent amputation, thus producing a violent and absorbent action—an action which, after a short struggle, exciting general febrile irritation, absorbs the powers of life. For a most powerful absorbent action must be one of the qualities of the nervous system, or how account for its fatal action in an hour or a day, when some violent shock of pain,, or passion, destroys life without organic lesion ? Pain, for in- stance, will kill, and a remarkable instance occurred during my house-surgeoncy at the Westminster Hospital, many years back. A fine athletic, healthy-looking young man, was admitted with retention of urine. Although he described himself to have been suffering since the previous night—this was the after- noon—yet the immediate urgency of the case, from distention, &c., was not deemed sufficient to warrant puncture until other measures had been tried. In less than two hours he died- No organic lesion was discovered in the post mortem exami- nation. To this peculiar effect and train of symptoms the cases of secondary amputation were certainly not so liable ; nor when they occurred, have 1 observed them generally in sucli strong

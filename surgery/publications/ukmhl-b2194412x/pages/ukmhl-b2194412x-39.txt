29 The mortality at Bribiesca during the same period was one in three; 160 admitted, of which fifty-three died : but these were all the worst cases, for there was a barrack in which a few beds were placed, and called the Brigade Hospital, where the sick were received in the first instance, and only transferred when their cases assumed an alarming aspect: by approxima- tion, 200 may be taken as the number admitted here, of which three died. The average mortality of cases treated, therefore, would be about one in six and a-half. At Santander, out of 717 cases treated. 111 died, making a proportion of one to GtK, nearly six and one-third ; so that allowing for sources of error inevitable under similar circum- stances, it may fairly be presumed that the mortality was, as nearly as may be, the same at the different stations; and the circumstances were closely parallel; for it was not until the 20th of February, that anything deserving the name of an hospital was obtained by the medical officer in charge at San- tander. The following is a return of Santander, corresponding in date with that given of Vitoria, and for which I am indebted to Dr. Stone, who had carefully collected the data at that depot where he was stationed.

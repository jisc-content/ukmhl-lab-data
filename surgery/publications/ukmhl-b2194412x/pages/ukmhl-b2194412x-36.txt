26 were administered. Strongly as this treatment, as regards the first administration of an emetic and cathartic, is opposed to the principles laid down by Broiissais and his disciples, the treatment was peculiarly successful, but possibly may be more applicable to soldiers, whose stomachs are generally loaded with crude food, fruit, and fiery stimulants, than to civilians whose aliment is more carefully prepared. It was gratifying to find how many were saved from the worst type; and even when I did not succeed in pre- venting their passing on to the low typhoid form, it was almost invariably observed, that the character was milder, and its duration shorter, while the patient's convalescence in its ra^ pidity contrasted much with those who had been treated by bleeding, in the first instance, or without the aid of counter- irritants and cold baths. In Portugal, as in Spain, this fever was by no means con- fined to the foreignersâ€”on the contrary, the native troops seemed to suffer greatly also, although, perhaps, not in equal proportion. Some of my readers may be disposed to attribute the gan- grene to the crowded state of the hospitals, the want of cleanli- ness, ventilation, &c., already described. Such a supposition, however, seems to be negatived by the fact, that pre- cisely the same tendency manifested itself in all the officers attacked, who were quartered in separate rooms, and in pri- vate houses. Although only one of those who recovered was crippled, the inflammation supervening having proceeded to gangrene in spite of every care and exertion, yet the difference may be much more naturally attributed to the greater care and attention, in the shape of domestic attendance, better clothing, bedding, Sic, which most of the sick officers could obtain. With fewer of these advantages, evidence was not wanting to prove, that the disease in them would have run exactly the same course ; and even with all this, two of the fatal cases had both their feet in a state of sphacelas when they died.

The general x-eturn of the whole gives 28 cases of fractured skull, of which 22 died, giving an average mortality of 1 to 11^. Five were discharged to duty. The loss to the effective force, in these injuries, therefore, was twenty-three in twenty-eight.

Thus it would seem that the sympathy with the liver cannot be very great or constant, although a few cases have come under my notice of great interest, and distinctly implying the pos- sibility of a direct and fatal sympathy, which I purpose en- deavouring to trace in another work. The 61 here alluded to, were under treatment from 1 to 3 months; 28 were dis- charged durin" the first month. Penetrating Wounds of Thorax.â€”Fi'om a total of 33, two were discharged to duty; but in one the penetration of the cavity was doubtful; and the other was shortly afterwards in- valided, his wound having disabled him ; seven were invalided. The mortality will be found therefore to be 1 to Ifg. Three, of both thorax and abdomen, died, nor do I remember to have seen any case of recovery in this class.

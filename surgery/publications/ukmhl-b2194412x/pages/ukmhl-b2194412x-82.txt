72 beyond the visible and appreciable effects of the injury—it is something much more subtle in its nature and the disorgani- sing effects which may succeed, proceed from the reacting in- fluence of the brain and nervous system, and not by absorption, inflammation, or any other material action arising from the site of the wound. Although physiologists—in which class should beincluded all who practise in the profession in whatever branch—for if they are not physiologists they are at best but sorry practitioners, whether in medicine or surgery—habitually refer much to the influence of the nervous system, and are ready to attribute to it whatever is strange and unintelligible in the phenomena of disease, it is at once a reproach and a misfortune, that we do this, much as the ancient sybils and physicians were wont, when they gave the moon and planets the benefit of a power as incomprehensible. Thus Cullen and his brother nosolo- gists, have their class " Neuroses," without having been able in any way to define in what this nervous influence consists, or how it acts ; and if asked what we know of either its nature or mode of action, we have but a very unsatisfactory answer to give. All that the accumulated ingenuity, talent, and in- dustry of physiologists have been able to effect in this—the most interesting of all researches, perhaps the most important connected with our organization, may be told unfortunately in very few words. And when all is told, how much nearer are we to a knowledge of the great mystery of our organization, and the wonderful operation of all nervous matter ? There is a complex set of phenomena in the moral and physical nature of man, now almost separately and distinctly apper- taining to and proceeding from the one or the other, now mingled and blent together in force and undistinguishable unity : in one instance producing effects on the material frame so slowly as to be appreciable in its ravages or amelioration only at long intervals, at others, concentrated, rapid, and crushing,

91 wounded Spanish and English, after crowding, to overflowing, the Spanish hospitals and churches, where this fever first pre- sented itself, ended by crowding the English hospitals, for a time, also; and, although measures were taken to prevent any considerable excess in the divisions reserved for serious wounds, yet, in the whole hospital of San Telmo, for two or three weeks, there were 800 patients, instead of 600, which was its esta- blished number. That any injurious efi'ects should fall more particularly upon the most critical cases, the amputations, was of course, to be anticipated. The operations, all except one, were performed by practised operators; I performed several myself, and only saved one ultimately, a second dying just as the last point of his stump was healing, with large abscesses in the liver. An abstract of the case has been given. Return showing the relative success of' primary operations performed on the Field and in Hospital, from May 5, 1836, to June 10, 1837. On tlie Field.

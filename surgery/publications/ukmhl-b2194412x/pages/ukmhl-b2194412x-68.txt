The quantity of fracture boxes, &c., sent out for the Legion was so disproportioned to the possible exigencies, that I am in- clined to think the whole of the wounded might have been put in splints ! It would assuredly be no difficult affair to collect, from the surgical memoirs of armies and their campaigns, abundant proof that more positive data and some fixed average is required, to enable governments to provide for the wants of the wounded, without the extremes of excess and penury meeting in the same measures. It seems to me, that the most certain and ready means of obtaining such indica- tions and guiding averages, would be the formation of a table founded upon the results of several actions.

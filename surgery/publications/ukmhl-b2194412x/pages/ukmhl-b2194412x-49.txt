39 served, that many cases are borne on the hospital returns, which are generally in documents of this nature left out, being classed among the dead in action; severe wounds of head, chest, &c., many of which did not survive two hours their entry in the hospital books, their removal to the establishmentbeingexceedingly rapid, from its close proximity to the scene of action, and the exertions that were made to elfect this object. Add to this, that many admissions take place on a day of battle, which ought not strictly to be classed among the wounds, although casualties arising from it, falls, burns, sprains, kicks from horses, &c., &c., these by my directions were never included in the tables. A great many slight contusions and grazes were, moreover, never admitted. These causes in- fluence greatly the apparent average of mortality, which it would have been very easy to render more favourable, but in my opinion, the conclusions would be less rigidly accurate, and less valuable for the purposes of science. Before entering more particularly into the scientific detail, a few observations may be useful on circumstances which affect the wounded before their admission into an hospital, and also on the discipline and interior economy of these establishments, upon which the successful treatment of patients most materially depends. The transport of wounded from the scene of action is an affair of no small importance and difficulty in the operations of all armies, not only involving the lives and welfare of the maimed, but sometimes affecting directly, at others indirectly, the whole corps-d'armee. It is a subject, therefore, to which I have given much consideration during several campaigns in Portugal and Spain, with a view to determine, in my own mind, the best and most efficient plan, and put it to the proof of experience. Twelve of Cherry's carts were sent out with the British Auxiliary Legion, at Mr. Guthrie's recommendation. They

Perhaps this may seem tediously minute ; but as the re- sults of the cases may tend to controvert or to confirm im- portant conclusions already received as axioms from the high authorities by which they are sanctioned, it is desirable that those to whom the subject may prove interesting, should have at once the means of judging how far local circum- stances, independent of the injuries and their treatment, may have influenced the results observed. I have only further therefore to remark, that there was a free circulation of pure air, the sea-breeze circling round and through the building; the necessaries at the further side of the staircase were perpendicularly over the beach, a hundred feet below. The great thickness of the convent walls assisted to keep the wards cool in summer and warm in winter; so that, with order and cleanliness, which was strictly enforced, the whole hospital was perfectly free from all bad odour, and the establishment was provided, after the first week or two of its formation, with diets of excellent quality, and with everything most necessary to the efficient treatment of the wounded, and the regularity and good arrangement of a military hospital.

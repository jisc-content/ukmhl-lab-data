12 stances, more sickness than we had to complain of might fairly have been expected. The number reported by the medical officers of brigades was even smaller than at Bilbao. As the sick quarters, however, presented nothing but confinement and physic in the shape of inducement, (the severe cases were sent to the Spanish General Hospital,) doubtless many who, under other circumstances, would have reported themselves sick, continued on duty. The troops, too, were daily expect- ing to renew their march, and scarcely time enough elapsed for the stimulus of the last to be exhausted. Thus the small sick list may perhaps be explained: for although here, pro- bably, the seeds were germinated, of the disease so shortly destined to thin our ranks, privations are often long felt be- fore their effects tell upon the system in any very tangible form. The Legion was again in motion on the 1st of Decem- ber, and on the third arrived at Vitoria. The loss of life, in the period we now approach, was great; yet all armies, and the British not less than others, have been, at times subjected to privations and miseries, and to a mortality, under such circumstances, fully equal to that of the Legion at its worst period : but that which leaves the sting, in all my recollections of Vitoria, was the inertness, the lukewarmness, and sometimes the hostility, of the authori- ties.

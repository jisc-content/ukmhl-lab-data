50 The mortality upon the total of these actions is 1 to 1^^; but the results of the different actions show the difficulty of esta- blishing a correct average, or rather, the necessity of taking the average of a large number of cases. The cases of October, which offer so favourable a result, were all, with one excep- tion, injuries of the most severe kind. Five complicated with fracture; and in three of these the ball was lodged. Among the whole of the injuries of this class, which occurred during the twelve months, are two other cases of recovery. One with the ball lodged, and one without fracture, making a total of nine. The nature of these injuries, and the causes influ- encing their result, are of the highest interest, and well repay careful investigation. I must, however, confine myself here to the more general results alone, and reserve the considera- tion of this subject to a future period, when these cases will prove, satisfactorily, two points of importance, among many others. 1. That the presence of a foreign body in the lung (a musket-ball for example) does not necessarily produce, nor consequently imply, disease of the parts surrounding and in contact. 2. That a sympathy exists between the raucous membrane of the alimentary canal, and active or long-continued disease of the lungs materially affecting the result of the case. Penetrating Wounds of Abdomen.—The total number is nineteen, from gun-shot, of which one alone recovered, to be invalided; seventeen died the first month. One case of reco- very occurred in an officer, in which there was lesion of stomach. A third case recovered, after a stab from a knife, apparently wounding the liver. Penetrating Wounds of Joints; in which class is included ox\\y those cases which were not amputated in the field. (Of these there were four—one shoulder, two elbow, one wi-ist; the last only died.) There were 37 cases admitted into hospital, lud 21 died—1 to 1 f'|.

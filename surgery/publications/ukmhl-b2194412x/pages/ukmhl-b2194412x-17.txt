7 unfit for service and ought never to have been enlisted. We had in the ranks about a thousand men tainted, partially or totally disabled by disease, and from phthisis and scrofula, down to old ulcers, and varicose veins, the whole catalogue of the " disabilities for the British army "â€”and it is a long one, might have been run through with great facility. Of this number two-thirds, I should think, died in the hospital, and the whole number, without probably ever doing one day's effective duty, merely served to swell the numerical returns of the force, and crowd to a fatal degree the hospitals. It may be remarked, in addition, that of those classed as jit for service, that is, neither crippled nor diseased, two-thirds only were in the flower of manhood, or such as would be accepted in the British service ; the rest were either youths or elderly men. No registers having been kept of the whole force showing the age of each individual, it is impossible to give with greater accuracy the exact proportions. During the period of service, at different intervals, recruits were sent out, probably amounting to 1,500, and apparently enlisted after the same orthodox fashion, notwithstanding Mr. Callander, the Inspector-general of hospitals, received some long communications, written by different officers and persons employed in England, to assure us that some of the worst cases, sent back by the decision of a Medical Board held in San Sebastian, in the same vessel which brought them out, were very sound and fitting men : and with a perseverance much to be lauded, had its object been equally praiseworthy, these very men were actually returned to us. The returns of the General Military Hospitals of the Legion, during the period of service, from twenty-two to twenty-three months, give the following results; 13,407 cases admitted, 1,.588 deaths ; which makes the ])roportion of deaths about one in eight and a half, of the total number of cases treated, or })resuming the total amount of force disembarked in the

40 were employed on several occasions in the neighbourhood of Vitoria, and in all the actions in which the Legion was en- gaged in Guipuscoa. Upon the whole they were found serviceable, and much may be said with justice in their favour; but they are also hable to objections of some importance. Small as they are in size, calculated only for four wounded capable of sitting upright, in heavy roads they become too much for one horse or mule, unless a very powerful one. It is rare also that a single draft mule will draw well; it was almost in- variably necessary to employ two whenever we turned off the main road. The shafts and the wheels seemed scarcely proportionate in strength to the work of the cart: in heavy roads they broke down in several instances, and at each time either in the shaft or the wheel. It is precisely in such situations, in narrow, deep, and hilly roads, where there is no possibility of flinging a broken-down vehicle out of the direct line of march, that such an accident is sure to cause great delay and confusion, by rendering it impossible for anything in the rear to pass or ad- vance a step. Any other accident would only be to the de- triment of the four wounded. One of the nature pointed out may affect the march of a whole column, if more than one move by the same line, and at all events interfere with the closing up of the rear for hours, and, of course, if an active enemy be hanging on the skirts, is likely to compromise all that may thus be unavoidably detached from the column. There seems to me another objection relative to the wheels, but upon which I speak less confidently. Speed can never be an object in these carts, but rather a capability of progression, however slow, under the worst circumstances of time, roads, and weather: this is of the last importance. It appears to me, therefore, that if, at the same time that the wheels were made stronger, they were also somewhat increased in width of rim,

31 ticular instances of sickness and mortality in recruits, that anything approaching to a fair comparison can be established. If we take the greatest strength of the Peninsular army at 60,000, and I believe it never exceeded that, we shall see that in thirty months, from December 1811, to June 1814, 339,870 cases were admitted in hospital: take 100,000 off as an allowance for eight months, and we find that iu twenty-three months, a number of cases amounting to three times the numerical strength of the force, was admitted in the same period : calculating the Legion's greatest force at 9,600, and even allowing 5,000 cases for sickness in barrack wards, or distant cantonments, not carried into the returns of general hospitals, still the whole amount of our cases would not more than double the numerical strength. If we go farther into details of recruits, which form a still closer comparison, the result does not differ widely from our short but disastrous period at Vitoria. In less than two years, Sir James mentions, that the 91st regiment lost by death '2'20 men out of 1,703, a little less than one in seven, —but the brigade of guards, in twenty-two months, lost from death in hospital 674 out of 1,965, besides 280 inva- lided—that is, one-half of the whole were rendered ineffective by disease, and more than one-third by death. The I^egion was a body of recruits, with the additional disadvantage that they were never picked as recruits necessarily are for the guards ; so much so, that one-third of them came into the country unfit for service, and were certainly subjected to a degree and duration of hardships and privations not likely to befal the British troops. Mr. Guthrie, in a paper on the diseases of the Peninsula, published in the " London Medical and Physical Journal," and consisting of a report on the causes of the sickness which prevailed in the fourth division of infantry of the British army, formed of nearly 6,000 men, in Spain and Portugal,

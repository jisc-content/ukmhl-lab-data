67 distinct periods indicated for their performance; viz., Primary, Intermediary, and Secondary Amputation, corresponding with the diflPerent states of the patient. The generality of authors, in defining primary and secondary amputation, confine the one to the first period and the other to the third—what then be- comes of the second ? If unanimity of opinion be attainable, it can only be ren- dered so by the weight of facts, upon the accuracy of which every reliance may be placed—facts observed and classed so as to bear distinctly upon the various points of interest in- volved in any decision on the subject, and it is very doubtful whether any theoretical writings on the subject have ever been otherwise than injurious. Unfortunately we are" met on the threshold with a great if not an insurmountable diflSculty. In considering the subject of amputation, we find so many causes influence the result, some, it is true, evident, easy to observe and define, but others difficult to appreciate, although not the less certain in their action : and hence all tables are more or less inconclusive. Thus there are several classes of causes which exercise an important influence over the results of am- putation, whether primary or secondary, each branching into a multitude of ramifications, uniting, separating, and again interlacing, bearing upon each other, and finally, by their combination, producing the results upon which alone the rea- soning on both questions and the deductions are chiefly drawn. In large civil hospitals more leisure is attainable, but the nature of the injuries are not sufficiently various, and proba- bly no one life would be long enough to register the requisite numbers. And hence, doubtless, one of the chief causes of the discrepancy of opinion which has prevailed ever since the days of Pare, when amputation first became a surgical or scientific operation calculated to save life. From the causes alluded to, I may not hope to supply. ¥ 2

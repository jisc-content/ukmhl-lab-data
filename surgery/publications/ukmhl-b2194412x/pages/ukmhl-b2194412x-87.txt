•77 hitherto generally considered as a peculiar consequence of se- condary, may be frequently observed as a result of primary amputations; and is probably dependent upon the same disor- ganising action of the nervous system described as producing the two preceding classes of symptoms.

Nos 1, 2, and 3, are nearly parallel cases which may be taken as fair examples of the type of disease, which assailed chiefly the primary operations of that period, alfecting either lungs, or liver, or both ; with more or less distinctly marked bilious remittent fever. No. 4, illustrates the first or local class of effects, defined page 73. No. 5, is a striking instance of the mode in which primary amputations are sometimes carried off, without any evidence of organic lesion, or disturbance sufficient to account for an unfavourable termination, and depending, as I have above stated, upon the influence of the nervous system alone. • Complicated with penetrating gun-shot wound of thorax, and the only one lost during the campaign, out of five. t Only one of these with diseased lungs or liver.

80 heat, or redness of the part. The wound, which was closed, has opened again. B. open. Died, April 3rd, 9 a. m. Postmortem examination, eight hours after death. On exa- mining the stump it was found to be healthy, and firmly united except at the inner corner. The artery was dissected out, and afforded a good example of the mode in which arteries are filled up after ligature. The end of the bone looked unhealthy, some pus was found in the medulla. I'he opposite knee-joint con- tained upwards of a pint of foetid purulent matter ; the ball appeared to have entered a little distance, and to have slightly abraded the inner condyle just at the commencement of the cartilaginous structure; cartilage nowhere injured; con- tents of thorax healthy; liver enlarged, adherent to the peri- toneum, studded throughout its structure with tubercles, some in a stage of suppuration ; intestines somewhat injected, but neither thickening nor ulceration observed. The chief features of this case, are the rapid and healthy healing of the stump, unchecked to the last—the absence of all general or local symptoms indicating internal mischief the first ten days:—the indistinct diagnostic signs of the great disease of the liver, and the re-opening of the wound, with the sudden formation of a large quantity of matter from an injury, which at first seemed so incapable of producing mis- chief, that it was successfully treated and healed as a simple superficial wound of the integuments. The uninjured state of the cartilage proves that this formation had been exceed- ingly rapid.

In March and April it increased to 1 in 12t^, number treated 640; a ge- neral increase from 8 to 10 per cent. It would be difficult to fix upon any one circumstance as the true cause of this bilio-epidemic, or endemic visitation, although there were many exciting and pre-disposing causes. The following are the notes, made at the time, of the weather. " From March the 10th to April the 25th, the weather was exceedingly variable ; March 10 (the opening of the campaign) was a fine, hot, dry day ; 11, 12, 13, incessant and heavy rain ; the troops nearly all bivouacked; 14, rain at intervals-, 15, half the day rain, the other half fine; none of these days very cold ; 16, fine and hot.

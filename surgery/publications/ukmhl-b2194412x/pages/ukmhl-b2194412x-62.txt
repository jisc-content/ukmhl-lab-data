52 Of the 21 complete, Died. 3 were amputated in the field . . . . 3 ♦ 3 underwent primary amputation in hospital . 2 15 were reserved for cure, or secondary amputation. Of these, without amputation . . .8 In 6 amputation became imperative . . 3 One remains under treatment at the end of eighteen months without hope of ultimate recovery. 21 16 The fifteen cases reserved for treatment presented three cases of secondary haemorrhage, for which, in two cases, ampu- tation was performed: one died, one recovered; and, in the third, the state of the patient forbade amputation, and the femoral artery was tied at its upper third; sphacelas of the foot supervened, and, on the eighteenth^day, return of haemor- rhage, and death. The artery and vein, it was found on exa- mination, had both ulcerated within the space occupied by the fracture. The ligature was applied about three-quarters of an inch above the giving off of the profunda. The ligature remained attached, and a clot had formed, occupying the vessel a short distance above it; a clot had also formed, and occupied the portion of the artery for several inches above the ulcerated opening: but the channel of the lower por- tion was perfectly unobstructed. A most instructive case, and fully proving the soundness of the principle which esta- blishes the necessity of securing both ends of a wounded artery whenever it be possible. Thirteen of these cases resulted from the action of tlie 5th of May; and were all fine, young, and healthy men, to whom my attention was particularly devoted ; and although the par- • One a sickly young Basque—another bad bis limb carried off, bigb up, by a cannon shot, and died of tetanus; both very unfavourable cases.

6 self sat, ascertained that upon an average 100 men in each regiment of infantry were either too young or too old for service, deformed, diseased, or crippled. Between 200 and 300 were invalided, as men absolutely and totally incapable of bearing arms. There were not means, it seemed, of embarking all, and the greater part even of these last, were still kept hanging on with the Legion. The system of recruiting adopted by the Spanish government, paying recruiting agents so much per head, without the previous precaution of respon- sible examination by medical officers, led to this evil, which was'soon found to be of great magnitude. During the ten days which a Medical Board sat, some of the oddest cases imaginable were brought before them.

" And, indeed, the government alone were chiefly to blame, for not taking proper measures to secure, and abide by the opinion of competent medical men, rather than to their enlist- ing agents, as to what might be considered " a proper man."

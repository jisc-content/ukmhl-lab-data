30 The sickness and mortality of tlie Legion and their causes during the first period, I have endeavoured to detail with clear- ness and accuracy. Questions of some interest arise from their consideration; the first periods passed in the country by the troops, were summer and autumn; quartered too in a valley, and on the rising banks, yet our sickness was exceedingly slight—and the men seemed to escape altogether the severe remittent and intermittent fevers which might have been expected to prevail. At the close of the autumn an ex- citing and exhilirating march of ten days, kept up, doubtless the healthy state of the troops—and even in Bribiesca each day almost expecting to renew their march, during their three weeks halt, the stimulus scarcely died away. It was only after their arrival in Vitoria, exposed to the greatest misery and privations in food, clothing, and shelter, that disease in the worst form—accumulated and concentrated—apparently fell upon us, and became suddenly and fatally developed in the worst forms of remittent fever—a species of typhus gravior, although peculiarly characterized. Had the appearance of the usual forms of autumnal diseases in that climate been merely retarded by the excitement and high spirits of the troops, leaving the seeds still dormant in the constitution, to be developed ultimately with virulence, but modified in form by the exciting causes I have detailed ? With respect to our proportional sickness and mortality compared with that of the British army in the Peninsula, great as ours may justly be considered to have been, I find, on re- ference to the returns of that army, that many parallel cases at least might be selected from those records. And the British soldiers could rarely, it is presumed, have been left in so destitute a state as the Legion at Vitoria, although of course at periods subject to great privations. Sir James Macgrigor's Sketch does not include the first two or three years of the army's sickness—consequently, it is only by reference to par-

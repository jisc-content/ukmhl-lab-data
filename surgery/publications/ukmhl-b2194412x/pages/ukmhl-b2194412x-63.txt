53 ticiilars cannot here be detailed, it may be remarked, that not- withstanding the greatest care directed to them, under my own observation, and with as good means for treatment as can generally be found in military hospitals on service, several pre- parations have been preserved, proving abundantly the diffi- culty, if not impossibility, of keeping the fractured portions in good juxtaposition, for the long period required by the tedious and exhausting curative process. Showing, moreover, how in- adequate are even nature's vigorous efforts to repair the mis- chief almost invariably the result of a gun-shot fracture of the femur. These cases, and the preparations resulting, are calculated to establish several other data of importance, viz. 1. That there is a relative and proportionate activity of the absorbent and secreting vessels established during the process of cure. 2. That the different functions and actions brought into play by the fracture, in the bone and surrounding parts, particularly in the periosteum, have a constant and injurious tendency to extend far beyond the seat of injury, and the limits where their action would seem alone required or bene- ficial. 3. That loose fragments are readily cemented together, and do not necessarily, nor frequently, become foreign bodies ; consequently, that no harassing operations should ever be performed to remove them. These, and many other points, requiring illustration and details in proof, cannot be advantageously entered into here. Of gun-shot fractures of the leg, not complicated with in- jury to joints, there were 57 cases, of which 20 died ; 1 to 2iJ. Eight underwent secondary amputation, and all recovered. Nine appear in the return, but the ninth was a patient who lost his feet by gangrene, at Uribiesca; and boti) legs were

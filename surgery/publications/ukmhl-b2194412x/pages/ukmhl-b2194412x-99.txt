89 case, it is difficult to avoid the impression, that, not with stand-, iiig the long interval, the febrile irritative action developed at that period must have depended upon the hidden influence of the nervous system. The absence of all change of structure in all the important organs ministering to life, as also of all bad action in the stump, tend to support this hypothesis. Since pain, by its tension on the nerves, will kill, or, in other words, since life may be destroyed without lesion or percep- tible alteration in any one structure, through the nervous power, why may not a severe shock develope a slower work- ing irritation, or absorbent, than we have hitherto looked for as the effects of nervous intervention ? In speaking of the amputations resulting from the actions in March 1837, the bilio-endemic remittent fever which pre- vailed has been alluded to; and although I do not, on that account, consider the table showing the total number of amputations in the fourteen months, furnishes a fair scale from which to deduce any conclusions respecting the relative mortality or value of primary and secondary operations, while taking care to give the first six months separately, I have not thought it right to leave anything untold in this exposition, the object of which is to afford facts in elucidation of various questions of surgical science. The reader will thus be able, by comparing the several tables, to draw his own con- clusions without being bound down or confined to my opinions and deductions. It will be seen, on reference to the explanatory notes accom- panying the returns, that there was, throughout the medical and surgical cases, an increase of mortality. Thus the average mortality in the wounded, exclusive of amputation, was 1 to lOir; while in March and April it was 1 to 9iJ, 512 the num- ber treated. Of the surgical and other cases not wounded, treated in San Telmo, the average mortality, for the thirteen

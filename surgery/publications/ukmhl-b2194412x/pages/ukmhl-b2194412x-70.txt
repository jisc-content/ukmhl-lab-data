GO 4. Evidence on the relative value and propriety of primary and secondary amputation. There are no questions in surgery so important, from their frequently and deeply involving life and limb, as those which i-elate to amputation in all its bearings. In no part of my prac- tice and experience in the treatment of gun-shot wounds has the conviction of the great importance of correct principles and good instruction in surgery been so frequently or strongly impressed. While these sheets are going through the press, a copy of the first of a series of lectures on gun-shot wounds, delivered by Mr. Guthrie, has reached me, in which I see with pleasure, that the rules and precepts which were of such essential service to me, when I became, yet young, the ar- biter of the lives and limbs of my fellow creatures, are about to appear in print, and will no longer be confined to the cir- cle of his own pupils. There were two precepts above all others he never lost an opportunity of enforcing, and which, doubtless, will be reproduced in these lectures, of such vital importance, and so often exemplified by the circumstances and cases which occurred during my campaigns, that I am tempted to encroach upon the more general results by relat- ing two or three instances. It happened, strangely enough, that the first amputation I ever performed, and the last, both presented features of peculiar difficulty. While yet nominally assistant surgeon of my regiment, although the only medical officer left, a smart skir- mish took placeâ€”a prelude to the first determined efflart to carry the town of Oporto by assault, from which resulted between twenty and thirty wounded of the English marine battalion. On the field at the time, the wounded were dressed in one of the huts forming an outpost. One of the first cases was a serious gun-shot fracture of extremity, in which the up- per third of the left humerus was severely shattered, and cither

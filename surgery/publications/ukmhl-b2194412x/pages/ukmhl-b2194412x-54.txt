u events, the facts resulting from their adoption on service may claim some attention. The first, perhaps the greatest difficulty experienced, was the impossibility of obtaining fitting men for the various and responsible duties of ward-masters, clerks, orderlies, &c., from the different corps composing the force. No commanding of- ficer willingly sends for hospital service his best men, were there not even a prevailing and very erroneous idea among militdry men, that any class of subjects will do for an hospital. Thus, if there be an incorrigible thief, drunkard, or dirty sloven, the first requisition that arrives for an orderly, he is dispatched: andj if a good man by any chance finds his way into the hospital establishment, no pains is spared by a zealous Colonel to get him back again, even altiiough he may have learnt all his duties, and become familiar with the routine, and in spite of his being declared indispensable in his situation. It matters not —he is a good man—ergo, the regiment wants him ; and nine times out of ten the regiment gets him, and the hospital in ex- change receives a stupid or a drunken fellow, or both, totally ignorant of all the duties, and as unwilling to learn as he is in- capable of doing so. Wearied at last by the perpetual recurrence of these annoy- ances, and convinced of the impossibility of establishing a regular and efficient system in the general hospitals while labouring under these disadvantages, permission was obtained to form two small corps, or companies, for the service of the hospitals and the transport of the wounded in the field. The first consisted of fifty rank and file, the skeleton of which the Inspector-General had formed in England as conductors for the carts; these were generally able-bodied men, and received artillery pay. The second, or " hospital corps," was selected principally from the weakly men of all the regiments, and from the wounded who remained partially disabled. These men had infantry pay, and neither corps had any extra allowance.

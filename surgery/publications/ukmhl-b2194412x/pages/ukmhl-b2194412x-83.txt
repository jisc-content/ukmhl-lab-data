73 it annihilates, at a stroke, reason, physical power, or both, to the extinction of life, with the pathless speed and power of lightning'. These are among the phenomena of the nervous system, which seems the concentrated union of our material and moral nature, partaking of both, imperiously controlling both. If we seek in the constitution of the world around us for some- thing analagous from which we may draw assistance and ex- planation, the mind inevitably reverts to the phenomena of electricity and galvanism, the only facts in the range of phy- sical science which seem by their properties and action to claim affinity, but they hitherto have lent us no assistance. Whoever has studied the facts which seem dependent upon our nervous organization, and pored over the ela- borate researches, experiments, and systems of the dis- tribution of the material apparatus, must have felt how incapable they were of affording the desired clue. Have we not been somewhat blinded too by the very minuteness and elaborate accuracy with which the complex mass of nervous matter, spread throughout and over the body, and ramifying in every fibre, has been described ? Losing sight of the true and important object of so much labour, ingenuity, and patience —the nature of this nervous influence—how produced and how controlled ? We have taxed the elements and ransacked every region to accumulate materials to act upon the frame—we have pored over its mechanism, describing every follicle, gland, and fibre in the whole structure, discovering or imagining uses for all, our researches into the nature and modus operandi of the most powerful and subtle of all the agents to which our organiza- tion is subject—the most constant and all-pervading in its action, leave us the least upon which to congratulate ourselves. Nevertheless it has long seemed to me, that it is from this source we must look for any further great improvement in the art of prolonging life, controlling suffering, or counteract-

27 The treatment above detailed I followed with many officers at Vitoria, and have reason to believe it the best adapted, carefully supporting and even stimulating the vital powers in the latter stages. Unfortunately the wretched state of our means rendered this treatment, simple as it may seem, always difficult, and sometimes impossible. About the middle of February, a long expected supply of blankets,hospital clothing, baths, cooking utensils, &c.,obtained from the British ordnance, arrived at Vitoria; and the medicines and medical stores originally ordered, before theLegion left England, were received at the same time. The possession of large convents enabled us to make better arrangements also, and the condition of the patients, although far from what it ought to be, was at least signally improved. On the 12th of April, the Legion began its march back to the coast, and the joy of leaving the scene of their sufferings seemed to act like a charm. I left on the 14th, and passing the different bri- gades en route—thinned though they were by the sick and dead left behind—a wonderful change might be remarked. Even the sickly and the wan pushed gaily on, and the stronger marched with the elasticity and spirit of men who had shaken off all care. As for my friends the Irish, they looked as if they had never known care nor sickness either, and when they piled arms were as ready for a "lark" as ever they had been at Donnybrook fair.

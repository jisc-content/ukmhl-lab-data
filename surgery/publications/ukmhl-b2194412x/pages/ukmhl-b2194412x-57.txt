47 The tables, which are here brought forward, furnish evidence upon many and important points of surgical science ; and al- though facts, however carefully or ably collected, are almost always too liable to a variety of interpretations, to establish any point beyond dispute, yet are they never without value. It is, on the contrary, eventually by such labours, and the subsequent exercise of a high order of reasoning powers upon them, that all the principles of medicine have been esta- blished, that all the improvements, whether in surgery or medicine, have been elicited and adopted. The following are the chief points of interest upon which the tables bear. 1. The average mortality in any given number of wounded, from musketry principally, both in the total and in the dif- ferent classes of wounds adopted in the returns. 2. The ultimate loss to the effective strength of an army, in the total number wounded, and in various classes ; and the scale in which the first loss, after an action, decreases, from the first to the sixth month. 3. The proportion the different classes of wounds bear to each other, and to the whole, inasmuch as the tables include the wounded of a force attacking and defending battei-ies, houses, and lines, skirmishes and actions in the open field, and the assault of a fortified town. The result of the whole may be taken as fair evidence on the average. 4. On the relative value of primary and secondary amputa- tion. 5. The proportion of cases of secondary haemorrhage, and of tetanus in wounds. 1. The average mortality in any given number of wounded^ from musketry principally, both in the total and in the dif- ferent classes of wounds adopted in the returns.

21 In others, again, dysentery and its train of symptoms pre- sented the leading feature, with the same fever quickly super- vening, running a still more rapid course. If, on the contrary, the patient's state improved, one of his first complaints, on recovering from his delirium, was the ten- derness and insupportable sense of heat and pain in the feet, for the relief of which neither bland nor stimulating fomen- tations, nor friction, nor opiates, general or local, availed. The feet would feel cold to the touch, but present no external appearance of disease or inflammation whatever, and were exquisitely tender; at last, either these symptoms would gra- dually disappear after a menacing inflammation, or finally se- parate the tips or the whole of the toes; but in the worst cases often involving feet and legs before the line of demarca- tion indicated its cessation. The reduced state of the patient rarely, if ever, allowed any option as to the performance of amputation before the line of demarcation was distinctly formed. Had it been otherwise, I should certainly not have hesitated in removing the limb, at some distance above the highest point of external disease. The following abstract, although but one case, furnishes, it seems to me, strong evidence in favour of the practice. A lad, about seventeen years old, a drummer of the Irish regiment in Portugal, was admitted into the English wards of the hospital of San Francisco da Ciudad, in the spring of 1834, having been sent from Cartaxo to Lisbon, a distance of about twelve leagues. On his admission he was found to be labouring under fever, of a low and nervous character, and mortification had already set in on one foot, extending to the ankle. The Portuguese medical officer at the head of the establishment happening to pass through, was shown the case ; and a few days afterwards, the patient having greatly recovered from the fever, and the mortification which had approached nearly to the knee, ap-

65 reach it without a second operation for taking up the axillary vessel. The case was a shattered humerus, occurring at the assault of Irun—the patient a young officer—and the arm was removed at the shoulder-joint. He was of a sanguine- ous and nervous temperament—bore the operation badly —falling into nervous paroxysms or convulsions. Seeing reason to believe that the track of the ball was across the artery, and had probably divided it twenty-four hours before, and no haemorrhage supervening, I considered it safer, for the ultimate success of the operation, and the patient's life, to put the stump lightly up, without, in the state in which he was, proceeding to any farther operation, which could be done with facility at any moment if the necessity occurred, and when his system would better endure the pain. The result fully bore me out in the course adopted—no se- condary haemorrhage occurred, and the stump healed soundly, and rapidly. This is one of the cases in which I consider the surgeon, by perilling in some degree his reputation, pro- bably saves a patient's life, which would otherwise be lost by an apparently less hazardous or more orthodox practice. And this case, however differing from the two preceding, equally illustrates the value of the great importance of a due appreciation, in contradistinction to an exaggerated fear, of the dangers resulting from haemorrhage, and our means of meeting them. For this dictated the practice in all three cases, and in each, I have no doubt, saved a life. In considering the general I'esults of the amputations of the Legion, nearly a hundred from gun-shot wounds, and pro- bably fifty from other causes, in many of which I have myself been the operator, and nearly the whole of them been performed, and the cases treated, under my immediate observation, setting aside a great number which occurred under similar circum- stances, during three years' active service in Portugal, the mind involuntarily wanders into a wide field full of interest, and F

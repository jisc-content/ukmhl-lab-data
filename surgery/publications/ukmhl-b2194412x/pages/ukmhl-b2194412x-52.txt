42 front, and not their sympathy for their comrades going to the rear, is required. As battles are not generally fought upon plains, but upon some vantage ground, often steep or wooded hills, the most rapid and effective mode of withdrawing the wounded from the scene of action to any point in the rear previously fixed upon, has seemed to me to be the following, which was tried upon different occasions, our deficiency of mules alone rendering it impossible at all times. A brigade of mules, say twelve to each column of 2000 rank and file, and four of Cherry's carts placed on the main road, or by the side if possible, at the point nearest to the centre of the column engaged,each mule having a bat-man, and a chair or seat on each side, (commonly used throughout the Peninsula, and forming a part of the pack-saddle,) will in most cases be found capable of picking up the wounded within a few yards of their post, and without delay. The carts, from the smallness of their size, may often approach close to the rear of the force engaged, and pass along its line, although there be only a cross- road, or even none at all; and they would thus take up at once officers or men with fractured limbs, or who may be otherwise too seriously wounded to be able to ride or sit. These are the means of transport from the immediate scene of action, for at, or near the point from whence they started should be a relay of spring wagons, capable of containing from twelve to fourteen wounded, and conveying them to the first ambulance or hospital station. In this manner Cherry""s carts might be employed with great advantage, as peculiarly fitted ; and in proportion as the means of the corps-d'armee to which my duties attached me allowed the arrangements described to be made com- plete, the wounded were more speedily transferred to the hos- pital station, and the number of sympathising and aiding com- rades greatly diminished. I once observed, in less than an hour, a whole battalion tail off after some fifty wounded,

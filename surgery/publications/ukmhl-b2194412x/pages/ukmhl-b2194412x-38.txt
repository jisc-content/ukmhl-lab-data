28 few admissions as might arise from weakly convalescents left behind ; seventeen men also died during removal to Santander. Thus the loss at Vitoria was 1,023, exclusive of December, which may be estimated at 100 ; at Trevino, and the other cantonments, certainly not less than a 100 more,—total, 1228, for Vitoria and its environs in six months.* During this period forty-five officers died at Vitoria, of which eleven were medical; the proportion of the latter, therefore, was about one to five, of other ofiicers about one in ten. The great disproportion in the mortality between the two classes, while it fully proves the zeal of the medical oflScers, also shows the fatal influence the hospitals exercised upon the mortality, which in the men was about one in seven of the whole force. During the first four months the mortality in the sick was about one in forty to the number treated. From the end of the fifth to the ninth month, one in five; from the tenth to the twenty-third, one in 13, And this last period ex- tended through a winter, to the full as rigorous as the first, the troops much exposed and constantly on duty in the lines, much dysentery, diarrhoea and fever prevailing among them, and after they had been severely debilitated and shattered by the previous sickness. The bad policy, setting aside any inhumanity there might have been, of the Spanish authorities, is written in this short but very conclusive para- graph.* * This number of deaths took place out of about 7,000 men which were at head quarters.—And besides deaths there were at least 500 men incapacitated for further eflective duty. Thus the defective arrangements of the Government, or its agents, and the hostility or inertness of the provincial authorities, lost to the cause the services of nearly 1,800 men out of a force of 7,000—forth.is is exclusive of nearly 200 who were swept away at Santander and Bribiesca, while labouring under the miseries and hardships of the same bad management. Thus in one winter they lost the lives and services of '2,000 men of the Legion, besides cripjiling and enfeebling the wliole force for six months—if not for the whole period, even were no account taken of the mass of human suffering unnecessarily entailed!

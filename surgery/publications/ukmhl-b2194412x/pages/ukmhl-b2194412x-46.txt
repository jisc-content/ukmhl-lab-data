36 are involved in them, to sketch, in a few lines, the locale where the wounded were treated. The convent of San Telnio consists of two wings, at right angles, raised upon abroad terrace, some twenty feet above the court below, in which the kitchen offices, &c. are situated. The principal wing, consisting of four stories, and extending a length of upwards of 160 feet, running from east to west, is built upon the declivity of the rock, on which the castle stands high above, its eastern end standing sixty or seventy feet above the beach immediately beneath it. The other wing only rises one story high above the terrace, although three from the court. A part of the ground or terrace floor was occupied by the stores. Inspector general's office, &c.; and the first floor, and part of the base, were formed into wards. The three higher floors of the principal wing were particu- larly devoted to gun-shot wounds, and no other; and in the second and third, the most severe and important cases were placed. A description, therefore, with the admeasurement of one of these, will give that of the others. Thus the third divi- sion, as it was termed, (or ward,) was 157 feet in length, thirty- two feet six inches in breadth, and from the roof to the floor fourteen feet seven inches. There were eight windows down to the ground, along the front, six and a half feet in height, and three feet four inches in breadth ; and one large window at the western extremity, looking on to the castle-hill; the spacious staircase and entrance into these wards being at the eastern end. Two small rooms were partitioned ofi"at one end, for the ward-master, and medical officer in charge. Each division was calculated for one hundred patients; although in March, a month particularly fatal to our surgical operations, in the six divisions there were 800 patients for a time. Thus rating each division at one hundred patients, there would be, by the above admeasurement, 744 cubic feet of air to each.

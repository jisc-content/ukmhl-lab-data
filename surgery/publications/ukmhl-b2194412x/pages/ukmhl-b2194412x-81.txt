71 tering into fragments like china—that it is a question sur- geons Cannot often have occasion to decide. A table is given of pi-imary operations in the field and in hospital, which, under that view, resolves itself nearly into a question of time—the operations on the field being generally performed within six hours, those in the hospital from the sixth to the forty-eighth. They are also classed, however, in similar injuries, which renders it more available for com- parison, being one of the conditions of parallel cases. Without any preconceived theory, the conviction was gra- dually formed, that even in musket-shot wounds, where the ge- neral shock or concussion is less than in cannon shot, the nature of the original injury exercises important influence on the final result of the operation. Thus I am disposed to believe, that the passage of a ball through the thigh merely breaking the bone in two portions will give the patient a better chance of recovery after amputation—cceteris paribus—than if the ball had broken the bone into twenty splinters or fragments; or had traversed the knee joint, crumbling the bones and lacerating the cartilages in its course. And this would seem rather to depend upon a difference in the shock to the system—some effect at least not easy to be traced, and difficult, if not impossible, fully to appreciate by our present means of in- vestigation. Has this point had sufficient weight in our esti- mate of the comparative value of the two operations in these wounds ? It has been admitted and distinctly stated in wounds from cannon-shot; but here the thrill and commotion is great and violent. A surgeon's attention is so much fixed upon the action of organic and material causes and effects, that perhaps a tendency is created to disregard or slight the more subtle and often primary causes of the material effects upon which he exercises his reasoning powers, while he seeks by liis skill to control their deleterious action. Thus it is not certainly that the parts where the operation is performed are less sound and

88 Case V.—Series of March. Illustrating 2d class, or general effects influencing the re- sults of primary amputations. (See p. 73.) Gun-shot fracture of tibia and Jihula. Amputation of thigh 2nd day. Died, 23?-c? day. No organic disease. (abstract.) Serjeant Major D'Almy, aged 37.—Injury.—Gun-shot fracture of tibia and €bula, three inches below the patella.

Post mortem.—Body not emaciated. The stump was found to have soundly healed, callus already rounding the end of the bone.

If the shocks of the original injury and subsequent operation did not produce death, what did ? And yet for the unusual period of twelve days, no one symptom, general or local, of an untoward nature, was remarked. On a careful review of the

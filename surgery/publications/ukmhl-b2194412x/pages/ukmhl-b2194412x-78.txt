68 that which must be considered a great desideratum. Although from fortuitous circumstances, unusual advantages were en- joyed on tlie one hand, yet on the other, accidental causes inter- fered with the results, and prevented their being conclusive. All the time and attention which could be spared, however, from many and responsible duties, was eagerly devoted to this sub- ject, and in another work I hope to furnish a detailed tabular abstract of between one and two hundred cases, which cer- tainly will leave very much to be desired,—but may neverthe- less not be wholly uninstructive or vain. I have too recently escaped from active service to be able to give it here in a complete form, even were it not otherwise objectionable from the illustrations, facts, and details, by which it must unavoid- ably be accompanied, to render it either instructive or avail- able for the purposes described. The usual returns of operations, divided into primary and secondary, giving the results alone, with merely such explanatory notes as were necessary to prevent errroneous conclusions, have been given. A few general observations in reference to this subject and the accompanying returns of operations, seem still necessary, and principally upon the causes influencing the results of amputations, and more particularly of many of those borne upon these tables. It is not enough, in my opinion, to say, here are two sets of operations, primary and secondary—the greater mortality is in the latter, therefore the former is most advantageous—a summary mode of settling the question, which would be most desirable, were it just, and as conclusive as the numerical dif- ference is distinct. There are at least certain classes of causes, the influence of which should be correlative and equal in the two opposing sets of operations, before the nume- rical comparison of results can be final. These I consider to be—

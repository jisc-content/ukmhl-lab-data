76 degree; and consider them, therefore, the resUlt of the two quickly succeeding shocks ; less liable, of course, to occur after one, or after two separated by a wide interval. To the circumstances detailed may, perhaps, be attributed much of the discrepancy which has existed in the opinions of many eminent in the profession. The one party not giving sufficient weight to this result of primary amputation, even where a cannon-shot or a shell has not caused the injury, and the other not sufficiently weighing the greatly preponderating disadvantages and fatal accidents, preventing or accompany- ing delayed operation. For this seems to be the chief, if not the only solid objection to primai'y amputation, whereas, against delay the number and importance of the reasons have long been sufficient to decide the question in my own mind. Baron Larrey and Mr. Guthrie, have alone accumulated a mass of facts upon this question, well calculated to set all con- troversy at rest. No one ever doubts in which cases there is the greatest amount and duration of suffering ; and this alone would have decided the question with me, had I been convinced the loss of life was equal. The conclusions then—to recapitulate—drawn from the careful observation of between two and three hundred ampu- tations performed under a great variety of circumstances, and from very various causes—are the following: 1. That there are two classes of effects, dependent upon the nervous system, which exercise their chief influence upon primary amputations. A nervous absorbent action, resulting from two violent and quickly-succeeding shocks, developed in a febrile form and capable of causing death, without perceptible alteration of structure or lesion of any organ. A nervous and disorganising action developed in an un- healthyj inflammatory or sloughing form, aff'ecting the stump. 2. That sudden formations of matter in distant and unin- jured parts, or active and destructive disease of lungs or liver,

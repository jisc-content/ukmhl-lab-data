4 stance which must be of very rare occurrence in most armies, and affording extraordinary advantages for observation. In the summer and autumn of 1835, the recruits for the Legion were landed along the northern coast of Spain, at Santander, Bilbao and San Sebastian. Near the end of Oc- tober, between 7,000 and 8,000 men were in the country, and in about tlie following proportion. English 3,200, Irish 2,800, Scotch 1,800. The English were upon the whole a bad class as to physical capacity ; a great number of them were sickly Londoners, or men recruited from Liverpool and Bristol, accustomed to the enervating life of a large city, and exposed to a total change of climate, food, and mode of life, on their arrival in Spain. The same observation applies to the Scotch, who were chiefly from the manufacturing towns—Glasgow and its neighbourhood—probably not more than 150 from the Highlands. The change of existence from a weaver to a soldier on active service is as violent as can be conceived. The Irish were undoubtedly of all tlie Legion the men who were physically and morally the best adapted for the service. Although many were recruited in Dublin and Cork, yet the majority were accustomed to pass their days in the open fields, and to sleep soundly on a mud floor, or the hill side—to eat what they could get, and when and where, with little regularity, but with a cheerful hardihood that makes even poverty sit lightly on the heart and frame. The career of the Legion through storm and sunshine gave a fair field for the observation of national tem- peraments. It often seemed to me that both English and Scotch were quite capable of growing thin, miserable, and sick upon the moody anticipation of evils and privations, while the reality itself seldom broke down the Irishman, and never until it produced actual disease. The result would seem to prove very unequivocally the fact, however little flattering it may be to my own countrymen.

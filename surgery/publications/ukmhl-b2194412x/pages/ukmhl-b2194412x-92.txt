82 berculated and hepatized. Abdomen.—The serum lubricat- ing the surface of the peritoneum tinged with bile. Liver.— The greatest part honey-combed by a congeries of abscesses containing pus of a bilious yellow coloui'. Chief features.—No sufficient cause appearing in the pro- gress of the stump to induce febrile action, it must probably have originated from the disease in the lungs and liver. The leading symptoms referred neither to the one nor the other until near death. This case proves one point, viz. that this extraordinary diseased tendency of lungs and liver does not depend upon diseased stump, neither does it necessarily pro- duce bad action in it. This, and several similar cases, tend also to prove that those affections of the lungs, &c., which have been considered peculiarly distinctive of secondary ampu- tations, and appertaining thereto, are more common in pri- mary amputation than has been described, or that at least the proportion is greater than hitherto estimated. Case III.—Series I6th March. Primary amputation of arm, within siw hours. Gunr-shot fracture of humerus. Died 2\st day. Diseased lungs. (abstract.) Serjeant Dehal, aged 46.—Athletic, robust.—Injury.—Gun- shot comminuted fracture of humerus, lower third. Ampu- tation performed within six hours; flap operation borne well.

19 twenty-three for the whole service of the Legion ; regiments separated in different villages; seven general hospitals, and upwards of fifty officers, sick in quarters. To those who are familiar with the service of hospitals it is unnecessary to say how terribly labour is increased, when arrangement, system, and abundant means to carry every measure into effect, are wanting. Hospital Serjeants, clerks, wardmasters, all fell ill in the same manner, leaving none to supply their places. In one week the change of the medical officers in charge of an hospital was rendered thrice necessary, by illness, and at a moment's notice. It was difficult to make any head against such a sea of troubles ; and, as if nothing should be wanting to a climax, there were no purveyors ; and, harassed as the medical officers naturally were, by their attendance on the sick, and their en- deavours to provide a remedy for a thousand deficiencies, they had to keep large cash accounts, purchase provisions, make out stoppages—attend, in fact, to all the administrative details! But I am weary of the task, although but a faint outline has been attempted—an outline, which, indeed, was due to the medical officers of the Legion.* * To show how little impression this period made upon the government's agents, a commission was appointed in June, at San Sebastian, nominally to settle the affairs of the old Legion, and form a new one. On this sat the chief civil agentof the Spanish government with the Legion, a Senor Llanos,* who at Vitoria stated bis instructions directed him particularly to render the medical officers and their sick effective assistance : and although he very rarely indeed trusted himself within their desolate walls, yet he did twice, I remember, and was otherwise made fully acquainted, by the Inspector-General and myself, with our state. One of the most notable decisions of this commission tended to fling upon the head of the medical department the onus of discrepancies or objections which paymasters made rightly or wrongfully to some Vitoria hospital stoppages ; and although aware that medical officers in charge, wardmasters, clerks, and all employes, fell sick, and died, each week almost—although two purveyors died before they could reach their • The other two members were lirigadier Tena, and Colonel Wyldc, to the former of whom the new Legion was indebted for n long series of miseries and (lersecutions as unmerited by the sufferers as tl)ey were disgraceful to their author. c 2

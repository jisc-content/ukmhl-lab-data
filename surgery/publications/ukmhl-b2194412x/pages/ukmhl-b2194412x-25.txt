15 The meat I have seen thrown into the camp kettles, so im- mediately after being killed, "that it was still reeking and quivering with the principle of life. I have seen the same meat swallowed but half-cooked; and that at six o'clock in the eveningâ€”not probably having been received until past four. The wine was sometimes very sour and bad ; at others less so, but rarely of sound quality ; and these were the rations, with such addition of strong stimulus, in the shape of aqua- diente, to assist and irritate the stomach to its hard task, as could be bought, borrowed, or stolen, often of course suffi- cient in quantity to produce temporary oblivion of every evil past and present, and to lay up store of new ones by inflaming the whole of the alimentary canal. During the first two months the Legion occupied large convents and churches, with a very imperfect supply of bed- ding and straw ; which the improvidence of all, and dishonesty of some of the men, constantly tended to destroy or diminish, until at last the majority lay on the boards, many on flag- stones, with no covering but their clothes, frequently saturated with rain and snow-water. And yet, when anxiously asked, more than once, by officers in command, what extraordinary cause could be assigned for an amount of sickness and mortality truly alarming, some- thing of incredulity has stolen over the countenances of my hearers while the natural causes above described were detailed : so little are we disposed to believe that great effects can be produced by the action of common causes. We are all prone to overlook or slight that which is evident, in a search after and if I add that lie had little or no bedding, I believe it will not be necessary to say anything further to account for the great prevalence of dysentery thereafter. " In the chronic stage, and when there was much debility, success was not to be expected from any mode of treatment where the patient was unprovided with warm clothes and bedding ; and I regret to say, that not unfrequenily we felt the want of these adjuvantia."

92 This, although perfectly correct, is nevertheless not conclu- sive, for it is necessary to bear in mind, before taking the re- sults in evidence, that there was a morbid cause influencing the mortality of one of these classes and not the other. Of those amputated in hospital, sixteen, out of which only three recovered, are of the series of March—a period when a bilio- cpidemic fever swept through the surgical hospitals, Spanish and English, like a plague, carrying off nearly the whole of the amputations, 1 to Ig^, in spite of every precaution and the most earnest care and attention on the part of every medical officer. Thus perhaps the comparison would be fairer if these were eliminated, and the return would then stand as follows, and present a fair comparison of similar injuries amputated on the field, and amputated in hospital a few hours later varying from 6 to 48.

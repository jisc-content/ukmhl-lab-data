CO involving, as already observed, many questions of the greatest importance in surgeryâ€”questions which have been much dis- cussed without producing unanimity of opinion. On the contrary, however, finally it may be considered settled by many, the question of delayed amputation is one upon which evidence is still highly interesting. One of the causes which lead to erroneous estimates of the comparative value of the two operations, and which has, it ap- pears to me, had no small share in producing discrepancy of opinion on the subject, is the mode in which authors have de- fined the periods and circumstances which constitute primary and secondary amputation. M. Boucher, in a memoir ad- dressed to the French Academy, defines three periods for am- putation, and these are reproduced and adopted by Mr. Guthrie. 1. The period between the receipt of the injury and the ap- pearance of the inflammatory symptoms. 2. When the inflammatory action has commenced and is more or less capable of disturbing the animal economy. 3. When the violence of the inflammatory symptoms and symptomatic fever have abated ; that is, when the suppurative stage is fully established. Against this division of periods no objections can be urged. They are distinct, successive, and easily appre- ciable, constant in their order, and generally with intervals very sufficiently marked. But what are we to terra the am- putations performed in the second period, which is an inter- mediai-y period ? They differ greatly in the principal circum- stances which are held to influence the propriety of the am- putation and its result, and ought neither to be classed with the primary of the first class, nor the secondary of the third. Would it not be a much better classification, leading to good and practical results and simplifying the question, to have three classes of operations, as there are three well marked and

toiled indefatigably when a sense of fulfilling an important duty could alone repay them, now applied, not less zealously, to the far more agreeable and fruitful labour of carefully observing and recording, the manifold facts presented by the treatment of nearly 5,000 cases—more than 1,500 of which were from gun-shot wounds.* In no way can I more effectually render them justice than by these sheets, which give the general results of the service connected with their labours. Another work would be required to complete the task, showing the most interesting facts observed during the treatment of the wounded and others, with such illustrations and details, as would render it generally practical and useful: this, however, is a work requiring much time and labour, and the more so, that the materials are abundant. The medical history of the Legion is divided into two periods—the first chiefly absorbed in the data and general re- sults relating to thefever which decimated the force. The second devoted to the considei'ation of the casualties of the field—of the nature, treatment, progress, and result of gun-shot wounds, borne out by a more complete body of notes, preparations and accurate returns, than can often be obtained in any service, from the fortuitous circumstance that the force was employed during fourteen months in the same lines, and almost always within two hours of the hospital where they remained, under the same medical ofiicers who received them, with some rare exceptions, until either cured, invalided, or dead—a circum- • To tliese officers generally I feel [personally much indebted, for the ready assistance and indefatigable zeal with which thoy seconded main following outmy views relative to the wounded, furnishing me with notes, preparations, &c., of every case of interest. To Staff Surgeon Johnson, Surgeon Shell, and Assistant .Staff Surgeon Dolce, particularly, I am obliged for the ability and unremitting labour, extending far beyond the limits of their mere duties, which they invnri- ;ibly displayed in the collection and arrangement of the various data and prepa- rations rerjuired.

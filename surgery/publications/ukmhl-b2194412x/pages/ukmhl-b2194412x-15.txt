5 At Vitoria, during the first winter of the Legion's service, the English brigade of infantry was swept iato the hospitals with great rapidity—one-third nearly—the Scotch next, about one-fifth—and the Irish but in a comparatively moderate pro- portion, probably not more than an eighth. I regret exceed- ingly that the exact numbers cannot be given; I had, how- ever, abundant means of satisfying myself that such was the proportion. Sir James Macgrigor, in his " Sketch of the Medical History of the Peninsular War," gives several parallel instances of the sickness and mortality of recruits, and particularly among arti- zans; and the recruits of the British army must always have been, as I shall have occasion to show, of a far superior class to the great proportion of those sent out for the Legion. He says, " The 7th regiment, in its nine first months in the coun- try, lost 169 recruits out of 353," that is, nearly one-half. In the 40th regiment there were 104 deaths out of 450 re- cruits—a little less than o4ie-fourth. Yet," he adds, " no regi- ments on that service were niore ably commanded, or better officered, than the Fusileers and 40th regiment." With re- spect to manufacturers and artizans, he further remarks, that, " of 358 recruits joining the 7th regiment in Portugal in 1810—II, 201 of them were artificers and manufac- turers, and 152 had followed agricultural pursuits; in the course of a few months, 122 of the former and 62 of the lat- ter died —the proportion being .six out of ten in the artizans, and four out of ten in the agriculturists the one beinff a mortality of nujre than one half, the other less, but more than a third. This is a mortality fully equal to, if not exceeding, any which occurred in the Legion. The national proportions of the Legion have been stated, but to understand its general character and composition we must go a little further. Jiefore the force marched from Bilbao, a Medical Board, on which both the Inspector-general and my-

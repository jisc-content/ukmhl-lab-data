24 indicated. The gangrene of the lower extremities seemed to me to depend upon the near approach to annihilation in the powers of life, continuing at the lowest point consistent with existence, sometimes for many days; pulse even impercepti- ble at the wrist; and if the circulation was too languid to reach the hands, it is evident that the loss of vital powers in the blood vessels, to propel the blood, would be still more fatally experienced at the point furthest from the centre. The cold- ness of the extremities, the dreadful pain which followed, with the supervening and often very unmanageable inflammation of all the soft parts, further confirms the probability that this is an accurate diagnosis, and that some disorganizing change took place in the structure, varying in degree. Many men, however, presented themselves at the hospi- tals, proceeding from their barracks, emaciated, Aveak, and sickly—often suffering from dysentery, with the toes of one or both feet in a state of gangrene. They always attributed it to exposure to cold on some particular day or night, and per- haps truly ; for with the languid circulation observed in them — the weakened vitality of the whole system, cold, or undue heat, and other causes incapable of producing such conse- quences on a healthy frame, might well prove the proximate cause on matter peculiarly predisposed. The distinctive characters, then, of the Vitoria fever were —its frequent commencement as common continued fever—its rapid assumption of the low nervous form, with nearly entire exhaustion of vital power, and gangrene of the lower extremities. The diarrhoea, or the dysentery, with which it often seemed ushered in, or with which it became subsequently complicated, although, doubtless, a strong predisposing cause, yet I think formed no integral part of the disease in question. That strong irritation of the stomach might exist in all, is more than probable. The causes of dysentery were cvcrv-

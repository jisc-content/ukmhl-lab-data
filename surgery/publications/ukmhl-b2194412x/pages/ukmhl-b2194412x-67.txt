57 3. The proportion of I he different classes of wounds to each other, and to the ivhole number of wounded resulting from an action. The accompanying table, in which the wounded of five of the principal affairs are classed, requires little further explana- tion. The proportions varied a little in the total number of wounded ; an additional column, therefore, was added, show- ing the average proportion taken upon 1,351. This table standing alone cannot establish an average con- clusively ; but I conceive that six such tables accurately com- piled, from as many sets of wounded men of 1,000 or 1,500, might place the question upon an indisputable basis. Nor is it a mere question of scientific curiosity, but one, on the con- trary, of great importance and capable of practical applica- tion, affecting all the preparatory arrangements of hospitals and their stores of every description. And when these prepa- rations are made upon an extensive scale for a large army, and to be sent to a great distance, it is of the last importance that the medicines, apparatus, stores, as well as the number and quality of the medical staff, should be adaptedhoXh to the number and the nature of the cases. A gun-shot fracture of the leg or thigh does not require the same apparatus of splints or consumption of dressings, pads, tow, &c., which either the arm or the fore-arm does. Still less are the remedial means re- quired for injuries of the head adapted for fractures of the limbs or wounds of the trunk. The medicines for ague or syphilis are not exactly the best adapted for a wound of the lungs or abdomen. It is common, I believe, in all armies to provide stores required for hospitals upon general data of the most vague description. The most erroneous selection must be the natural consequenceâ€”injury to the pa- tients, and loss to the government; magazines may be

11 sore legs; casualties; confluent small-pox: and in this order as to number. The number of deaths was very small. In this hospital, from the 15th of September to the 15th of October, 296 patients were admitted, 202 discharged, seven died, and eighty-seven remained under treatment; thus the deaths were as one to forty-two- The weather was fine, the rations good, and the spirits of the men, excited by the novelty of the scenes, and mode of life, excellent. In this state, after a few marches and skirmishes, at San Sebastian and Bilbao, the Legion commenced its march into the interior on the 29th of October. The sick and convalescent were left behind, with a portion of the medical staff, to be transferred to the Legion depot at Santander. Nothing could be finer than the weather, or more picturesque and invigorating than the mountain scenery through which our route lay. The second day's march brought us to Castro, where we halted a day, and sent round about two hundred men who had knocked up with sore feet, fever, &c. and were unable to continue. Nearly the whole of these were weakly subjects, who should have been eliminated at Bilbao. We arrived at Bribiesca, a miserable town in the plains of Castile, on the tenth day. There had been three days' halt at different places; and each day's march had averaged from fifteen to twenty miles. The men, upon the whole, marched well for raw troops; although the weight carried was evi- dently grievous to many. At Bribiesca the Legion remained three weeks; the weather was cold, alternately snowing and raining. The majority of the troops were badly supplied with warm clothing, beds, or bedding ; and although personal experience has taught me, that four stone walls and a roof are by no means to be despised, yet they leave a great deal to be desired when snow lies on the ground.

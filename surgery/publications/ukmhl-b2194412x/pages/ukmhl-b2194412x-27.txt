Thus, while the Inspector-General, armed with all the authority of General Evans, was engaged, by entreaties, threats, commands, and, more than all, un- ceasing application, in wringing from the reluctant authori- ties a house or a convent—by the time it was placed at our disposal it was no longer sufficient to remedy the evil! and, when a building was obtained—bare walls and floors; often no doors or windows ; rooms inconveniently distributed, &c.— behold our materials for an hospital! Then a few tresselsand palliasses, long used by troops, were with great difficulty obtained ; perhaps a few blankets; two or three camp-kettles, some cups and jugs. Fortune smiled on us, when a cart-load of straw or a hundred new blankets were received; and while this was going on, our sick list increased to 1,150, and upwards; our daily deaths to ten, twelve, and once seventeen. And how could it be otherwise ? Ventilation either in excess, during a rigorous winter, or deficient, accordingly as the disposition of the buildings placed patients in little close rooms, or vast corridors, without windows; the sick lying heaped together for warmth, even where space was not wanting; the delirious, the convalescent, the moribund, or dead, for a time within a few feet of each other.

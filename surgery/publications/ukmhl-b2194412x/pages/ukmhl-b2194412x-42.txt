32 during the years 1811 and 1812, gives the following facts relative to the proportionate sickness and mortality. " In the six months, from September to March, in the 7th regiment, there were 1,329 admissions from all complaints: of these 86 died in regimental hospitals, of whom 75 were recruits; 427 were sent to general hospitals, including 320 fe- vers, of which 160 died. Of the 246 dead in six months, 169 were recruits, out of 353 landed at Lisbon, in June 1811 : 77 were old soldiers out of 1,145, that is, nearly half of the recruits, and one-sixth of the old soldiers, or about 1 in 5^ of the whole number treated.* "The40th regiment, from March to September, had 1,189 sick admitted, of which 180 died (1 in 6|,) of 450 recruits 102 died (1 in 4^ ) of 1,117 old soldiers, 78 died in the six months; that is, nearly a fourth of the recruits, and a four- teenth of the older soldiers. "The third battalion, nearly composed of Irish and of young inen, during this period remained remarkably healthy, possess- ing no advantage over the others in local situation,"—which corresponds remarkably with the observations already made on the Irish of the Legion. Thus, then, it will be seen, that whenever we come to the detail of sickness and mortality of recruits, by which we can compare similar classes under somewhat similar circumstances, thai: is, in periods of great sickness, the difference is not great ; whereas, taking the average mortality upon the whole army and the force of the Legion, there is a difference so striking that it requires explanation. The mortality of the British army, taking the last thirty months of its service in the Peninsula, was only one in 18| to the numbers treated ; while • The 7th regiment seems to have been 1,500 strong j the number of cases, therefore, in six sickly months is within 169 of the strength. In tlie 40th, the strength appears to have been 1,567 ; tlie numberof cases amounts to one-fifih less.

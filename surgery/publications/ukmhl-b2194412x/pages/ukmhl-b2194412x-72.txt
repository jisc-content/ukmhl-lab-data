62 arm, and disengage it from the assistant, when he rolled at my feet. Fortunately, beyond a little delay, no mischief was done, and in a few seconds more the arm would have been off— when, to complete the chapter of accidents and my trials, the patient had twisted by his movements from under the pressure above the clavicle, and no sooner was the artery divided by a sweep of the knife than a gush of arterial blood unequivocally convinced me that there was no effective compression. It was but one jet, however, for in an instant my finger had com- pressed the orifice, and it was secured without difficulty or further loss of blood, and the operation was then concluded. The stump was somewhat deficient in skin, but the bone was well covered by muscle, and he recovered, with an excellent stump—and after much tedious exfoliation, with some use of the hand of the other side. And thus my first operation fully proved the value of the two leading, and most carefully enforced of the instructions year after year received from Mr. Guthrie—" Never to be alarmed at haemorrhage when the finger can reach the bleeding point"—" Be sure to cut the bone short." The first enabled me under very trying circumstances to save the patient's life; the second ensured him a good stump in spite of every obstacle. Indeed, so thoroughly had I been imbued with the opinions of my teacher on this subject, that in all the operations per- formed either by myself or by officers under my orders, I do not think a tourniquet has been half a dozen times employed under my observation. Another, among many striking proofs of how safely it may be dispensed with when the surgeon has sufficient confidence in himself, occurred many months later, in the action resulting from the last assault of Don Miguel's army on Oporto. They were about to make their last desperate effort, after several repulses, to overwhelm the hand- ful of men opposed to them, and probably they would have succeeded with their immense superioiity in numbers, but

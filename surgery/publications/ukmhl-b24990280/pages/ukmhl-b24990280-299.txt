FRACTURES OF THE LEG. 201 pervened, and it was only after amputation that the tibia was disco- vered to be injured. In the case illustrated by figure 153, the fracture besides being compound was otherwise so palpable, that there was no doubt that both bones had suffered, and that, moreover, amputation was imperatively necessary. These cases occurred in my own practice years ago in Edinburgh, and, with others illustrating the same subject, now form part of the collection at King’s College. Many different methods have been devised .and recommended for the treatment of fractures in the leg, and each plan has had its advo- cate as being superior to all others. Experience, if common reflection does not, will point out to the young surgeon, that what may answer well in one case will not do so in another; and, indeed, the circum- stances are so different, in the various cases of this kind which may come under his treatment, that he will soon have reason to feel asto- nished that certain methods should have been recommended in prefer- ence to all others, as being best adapted for the treatment of all frac- tures in this part. In one instance he will find that the treatment may be conducted satisfactorily without the slightest trouble, and in another he may discover that all his care and ingenuity cannot avert unpleasant or unfortunate results: there may be serious contusion and injury of the surrounding soft parts; there may be laceration of the skin, and compound fracture; the fissure in the tibia may be oblique, and the fragments, two or more, may have a constant tendency to be- come displaced; there may be great irritability of the muscles, parti- cularly during the early part of the treatment; great restlessness of the patient, or unwillingness to submit to the requisite confinement,— in short, a vast variety of circumstances likely to cause difficulty in the treatment, or, at all events, to induce an unprejudiced practitioner not to persist in any individual method, when common sense, or the ordinary principles of his profession, (the two ought to be deemed synonymous,) should point out to him that some other plan must be pursued. Sometimes a fracture may be treated without the aid of any appliance; on other occasions, what may be deemed the most perfect apparatus will not enable the surgeon to be so successful in his treat- ment as he could wish; and here, in accordance with the general object of this work, I deem it a duty to direct the attention of the junior part of my readers to the chief reasons for resorting to the use of apparatus, or splints, in the treatment of fractures, as I am inclined to believe that false notions are occasionally entertained of their real purposes and value. The chief purpose of a splint is to enable a sur- geon effectually to keep the fractured surfaces of a broken bone in the closest apposition during the time requisite for reunion, and its value will consist, m a great measure, in the manner in which it does so, and in the protection which it gives to the limb against the various casualties to which the latter may be exposed during the treatment, either from muscular contractions, front sudden and unexpected move- ments on the part of the patient, or from external sources. The daily practice of surgery, or a slight acquaintance with pathology, points

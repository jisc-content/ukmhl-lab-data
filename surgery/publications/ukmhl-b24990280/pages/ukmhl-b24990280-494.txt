476 THE HEAD AND NECK. would be more conspicuous than that following the incision above advised. Sometimes disease is so situated that the angle of the bone, with a considerable portion—perhaps the whole—of the ascending ramus has to be removed. If a small part only of the latter is affected, the inci- sions already described—at all events carrying that over the posterior border a little higher—will permit the application of the saw and for- ceps. The bone in this situation is somewhat harder than in front, and from this circumstance, as also from its position, there will be greater difficulty in using either of these instruments. The shape of forceps indicated in figures 15 and 16 (p. 12) will be serviceable at this part. When the jaw is interfered with here, the proximity of the external carotid must be remembered. If the disease extends so high as to approach the neck of the bone, Fig. 216. it will probably be best to disarticulate.

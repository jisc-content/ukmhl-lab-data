228 THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. Fig. 126. The humerus is covered by nearly an equal thickness of soft parts throughout its circumference, and it seems to me a matter of little moment from which side the flaps are taken, provided the main ves- sels or nerves are not split. If the artery is thus divided, there may he some trouble in securing it; if it be a large vein, more injury has been inflicted on it than the operation warrants, and, if one or other of the nerves, the same remark is applicable; for in both instances very troublesome results might follow. The operation should be done in the lower third of the arm if cir- cumstances will permit, but the same instructions will answer for any part of its extent between the condyles of the humerus and its neck. The next cut (fig. 127) exhibits the stump on one of my patients, whose arm I amputated some time ago at Kingâ€™s College Hospital. The flaps here were slightly different from those referred to in the description of the operation as given above; but the stump, in my opinion, could not have been better, from whichever side the soft parts had been preserved. For a description of the circular operation in this situation, I may refer to page 131, and shall here only state to those who may prefer this proceeding, that the arm, in my opinion, presents the best part of the upper extremity for the application of such a method. In performing amputation of the arm, the surgeon may stand on either side he chooses, or that may be most convenient. I generally prefer the outside, and, for reasons stated in my observations on am-

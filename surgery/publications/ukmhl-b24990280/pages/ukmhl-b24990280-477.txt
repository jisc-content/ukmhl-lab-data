OPERATIONS ON THE LIPS. 459 and it may be necessary to push a bougie along the passage for the purpose. It may be found difficult to effect the introduction of the thread with the probe, which will be barely of sufficient length, and if a small flexible bougie is at hand it will suit better; but what will answer best is a piece of curved elastic watch-spring concealed in a sheath some- thing like a common catheter. At the point of the sheath there is a bulb with an eye in it which is attached to the spring, and when this is pushed along the nostril, after the end has been carried into the pharynx, it can be made to project into the mouth in such a way that a thread attached to the eye may be readily laid hold of, or if it is preferred the eye can now be threaded with a small cord attached to the stouter one on the plug, and the rest of the proceedings can be accomplished in the manner described above. Such an instrument is to be had in the shops. CHAPTER VIII. OPERATIONS ON THE LIPS. In operations for hare-lip, if the fissure be single, the proceedings may be conducted in this way: If the patient is young (an infant) a cloth should be wrapped round the chest, so as to confine the arms ; a pil- low-case answers the purpose well, as the legs also can thus be secured by slipping the patient into it; then the child should be held by an assistant, with its head resting, face uppermost, between the surgeon’s knees; if he puts on an apron it will answer the double purpose of keeping his trousers free of blood, and preventing the child’s head from falling too low ; a little pressure with the thighs will enable him to keep the head more steady than by any other means ; a sharp- pointed scalpel, or, as I prefer, a narrow straight bistoury, should then be passed through the lip, immediately below the nose, at the margin of the fissure, and carried downwards, so as to cut away the round edge of the gap and the blunt angle at the mouth ; if this slip is still attached at the nostril, it must be separated by the point of the knife, which should then be run down the opposite margin in the same manner, and with the same care that the angle at the lower part is completely cut off; if the textures are closely adherent to the bone they should be slightly separated, when the margins will be more easily and more accurately brought into apposition, which should now be done by means of needles, such as those described at page 34 ; the further steps of the operation, as to the application of threads, cutting the needles, removing them, and for the after-dressing, being such as have already been described in the chapter on sutures, at the commencement of the volume.

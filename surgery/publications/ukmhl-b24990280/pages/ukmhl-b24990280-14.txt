X PREFACE. not find language sufficiently expressive of his own estima- tion of the artistical skill and professional knowledge of Mr. Wm. Bagg, by whom the drawings have been executed. For most of the designs the author is himself responsible, and for others he has been indebted to the diagrams left, for the use of the chair which he has the honour to occupy, by his predecessors Mr. Green and Mr. Amott. To many friends he has to offer thanks for valuable com- munications and assistance, among whom he may mention Sir George Ballingall, Mr. Lizars, Mr. Watson, Mr. A. Miller, Dr. Handyside, Mr. Goodsir, Mr. Norman, Dr. Machardy, Mr. Elliot, his former pupils Dr. Dods (Connaught Rangers), Dr. George Williamson (Fort Pitt), Dr. Richard Mackenzie, and in an especial manner to his present assistant, Mr. Robert Storks, whose services have greatly contributed to lessen the labours attendant on the authorâ€™s task. 8, Dover Street, Piccadilly. 1st October, 1842.

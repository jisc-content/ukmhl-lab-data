A SYSTEM OF PRACTICAL SURGERY. PART I. INTRODUCTION. THE ELEMENTS OF PRACTICAL SURGERY. CHAPTER I. SURGICAL ANATOMY AND PRACTICAL SURGERY. The inseparable connexion between Practical Surgery and Surgical Anatomy, induces me so to associate these two subjects in the follow- ing pages, that I may be enabled to give full scope and effect to those objects and intentions, which influence me in undertaking the arrange- ment and elucidation of what I have ventured to term “ A System Of Practical Surgery.” The term Surgical Anatomy is used to express the relative position of the different textures and organs of the human frame, as the surgeon finds them in the treatment of the diseases and accidents which belong to his department of the profession. The term is usually understood as applicable to the parts in their normal state; but this by no means gives a sufficiently comprehensive idea of what the practical surgeon implies by Surgical Anatomy. In addition to a knowledge of rela- tive position, it may be said that no one can possess a thorough knowledge of Surgical Anatomy, who is not conversant with the va- rious alterations effected by disease or accident, in the appearance, shape, and size, as also with the differences in relative position, oc- casioned by disease, in or near any portion of the body. The opera- tion for strangulated hernia affords a good illustration of these re- marks, as it is well known to the practical surgeon, that the study of the parts in their natural state, through which a hernia protrudes, n

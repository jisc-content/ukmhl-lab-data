DISLOCATIONS OP FINGERS. 149 of bones: my object being, not to describe that kind of anatomy which is found in all elementary works on the subject, nor to give facility to the recollection of mere names; but to encourage that personal and manual examination, which can alone serve the student or practitioner for the study of surgical anatomy. Before mutilating another arm, by operations or otherwise, it may not be amiss for the student to practise the application of bandages, splints, and other apparatus, such as may be required for accident or disease, on the living body; and these proceedings may be accom- plished on the subject, on a lay-figure, or, what will be best, on the arm of a friend. They may be of little moment to those who have already had the advantage of being engaged in practice, but many students will derive no inconsiderable benefit from such lessons, as they will afterwards perceive in performing similar manipulations on the living body. In a case of wound of the humeral artery, (in- flicted, perhaps, in venesection,) it may be considered advisable to apply bandages from the points of the fingers upwards as far as the seat of injury, and this may now be done as afterwards described. Before alluding to the manner of applying apparatus in cases of dislocation or fracture, it will be proper to take the nature of such accidents into consideration. Dislocations in the fingers are of frequent occurrence, and very often of such a nature as to induce the surgeon to remove the injured part by amputation. In such instances, in addition to the displace- ment, the bones may be broken, the soft parts extensively injured, and the joint or joints laid open.

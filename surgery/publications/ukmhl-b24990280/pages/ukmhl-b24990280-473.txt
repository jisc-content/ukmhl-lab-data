Now a columna was formed in the manner already described, and at last I had the satisfaction of producing such a result as that exhibited in figure '208. Here matters were still further improved by the addition of an Fig. 208. artificial eye, to make amends (in some degree) for the loss of the original one, which had been destroyed by ophthalmia some years before.

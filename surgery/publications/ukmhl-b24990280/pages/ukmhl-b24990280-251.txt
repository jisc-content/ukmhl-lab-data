He can scarcely err in preserv- ing sufficient covering to form a good stump in either or in any way, and his chief anxiety will be with reference to the axillary artery. It is customary to desire ati assistant to compress the subclavian above the clavicle, as it passes over the first rib, by means of his fingers or thumb, or with the end of a good-sized key covered with a pad of lint. However, I would not have the operator trust too much to this plan. In most of the instances where I have seen it pur- sued, indeed I may say in all, 1 have observed it to fail. It is cer- tainly very easy to compress the subclavian in this situation, in every properly-formed person, when the body is at rest; but the violent muscular movements during amputation make a vast difference: the clavicle and shoulder are almost invariably drawn upwards, and the pressure then is uncertain. I have known a surgeon blinded for an instant with the first gush of blood from the axillary artery after its division in amputation, at a time too when he expected that the subclavian was commanded. So sceptical am I as to the utility of this practice, that I feel almost inclined to say that it is worse than use- less : the pressure, (which is usually more encfgetic than there is any occasion for,) provided it be properly applied, is often attended with

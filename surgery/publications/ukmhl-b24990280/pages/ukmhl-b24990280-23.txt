AND OPERATIONS. rally, but with practice, much ease, elegance, and dexterity, may be displayed when the knife is thus held, and even the most minute dissections may be effected with the hand and scalpel in the attitudes here represented. Many operations are now performed with the bistoury, and it will be advantageous to practise dissections with it, as well as noth the scalpel, so that it may be handled without awkwardness on the living body. A blade of the shape represented in the next sketch, about three or four inches in length, fixed in a handle similar to that of the scalpel, or in such a one that the blade can shut like a pocket-knife, may be used on these occasions. The instrument may be held in the same manner as the scalpel; it is awkward, however, to do so in the manner exhibited in figure 2, in consequence of the fingers being so near the point, and that here represented (fig. 4), perhaps, com- bines more elegance, freedom, and firmness of movement than any other. Whatever attitude is chosen at first, it is necessary, with ap- propriate movements of the fingers and wrist, so to change the position and movements of the hand during the incisions, that the cutting edge of the instrument may be drawn towards the operator, or from him, at will. There are different kinds of bistouries that I shall speak of afterwards, and both this instrument and the scalped require to be held in particular attitudes, which will be most advantageously explained and exhibited, in describing the manner of performing the various operations, in which particular instruments and positions are of consequence.

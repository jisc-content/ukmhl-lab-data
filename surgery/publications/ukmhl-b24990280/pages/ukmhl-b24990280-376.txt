the inferior extremity. 3.58 wards and outwards so as to form a flap, the extremity of which is pointed out by the dotted line on the outer side; next, the knife should again be introduced in front, and carried backwards in a line with its original course, but on the opposite side of the bone, when by cutting again downwards and towards the surface, as partly indicated by the other dotted line, the inner flap is formed : both of them should then be drawn upwards with considerable force by the hands of an assist- ant and an incision made round the bone, fully an inch higher than the place of transfixion : the saw should then be applied in the course of this last cut, and the separation completed by division of the bone. In transfixing, the point of the knife should be thrust directly down to the femur, with which it should then be kept in close contact as it is carried round to the opposite surface, and this process will be greatly facilitated by grasping the limb as directed. The assistant who has charge of the flaps should not forcibly elevate the one first made, as the knife is thereby prevented from passing readily across the limb the second time: he can scarcely, how- ever, be too energetic after the other is cut in drawing both up- wards, so as to give plenty of room for working the saw without rubbing against the soft parts. The femoral artery is not divided until the second flap is formed; indeed, Vermale had this in view when he made his external wound first; but I do not think it of much consequence whether this vessel is cut across first or last, pro- vided the surgeon takes sufficient care to have the vessel properly commanded above, or has sufficient self-confidence, in the event of an accidental mistake, to grasp the limb, and thus whilst he may arrest the bleeding with one hand he can seize the vessels with the forceps held in the other. I deem the proposal of saving the artery to the last as of little consequence, and am generally in the habit of making the inner flap first instead of the outer, as I can thereby see the pro- gress of the knife much more clearly during the second thrust. The next drawing (fig. 191) exhibits the appearance of the stump with lateral flaps. It will be found during the dressing, that care is required to keep the soft parts in their proper and natural position: they have a tendency to fall backwards, and thus the end of the femur comes nearer the anterior angle of the wound than it should be : moreover, it will be found in the course of a few weeks, that the parts behind are all more drawn upwards than those in front, and at last the bone seems to have a very scanty covering. To provide against the latter occurrence it may be well to leave the flaps a little longer behind than in front, and for the former, the bandage, properly applied after the first ten or twelve days, will do all that is required, if the dresser is careful in keeping the soft textures well fonvard during its adjustment. In figure 190, the point of the knife is nearer the table than it should be on the living subject, for by passing it somewhat ob- liquely to the long axis of the femur the soft parts can be kept longer below (or behind) than they might be if transfixion were made

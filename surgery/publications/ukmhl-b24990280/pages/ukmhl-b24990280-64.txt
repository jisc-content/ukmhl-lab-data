4G COUNTER-IRRITANTS. Fig. 49. wish to cover an extensive surface, as in spinal or hip disease, then I have one of larger dimensions. The two heads of the cauteries here (fig. 50) represented, are such as are most generally in use among surgeons: the round head, for making large eschars, the pointed one for touching the surface less extensively. Sometimes the instrument is made of a flat button- shape, at other times quadrilateral ; but there can scarcely be a limit to shapes and sizes of such tools, for I have known the most cautious of surgeons, an advocate for the cautery, use almost every shape and size, from a ware,â€”such as the stilet of a bougie, or a steel bougie it- self, to an ordinary fire-poker. The iron should be heated to a dark red, and its margin, after having been rubbed clean on the hearth-stone, floor, or on a bit of wood, should then be drawn along the skin, as indicated in the preceding sketch, the lines being of such a length and number as may be deemed requisite. As soon as the process is completed, lint dipped in cold water should be applied, and renewed from time to time during the lapse of two or three hours, when a poultice should be put over the injured surface. Cold seems to have a good effect at first in allay- ing the pain. The chief advantage which I fancy the plan above described to possess is, that sudden excitement is produced over a large surface, whilst at the same time the skin is not destroyed and converted into a slough, as with the caustic or moxa, so as to leave a large open surface, which will heal but slowly, and will always leave a consider- able scar. If, on the other hand, a round or flat piece of iron is ap- plied even once to the surface, a slough must be produced, which separates more slowly, and leaves a more troublesome sore than the small lines of sloughs, and the consecutive sores, resulting from the practice above recommended. There are other counter-irritants which I have occasionally used

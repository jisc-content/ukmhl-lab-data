INSTRUMENTS, DISSECTIONS, nor break with the strength of the hand ; the cutting edges should be sharp, and come nearly in contact when the handles are shut ; and they should be finely tempered also, so as not to be readily turned or broken. When about to be used, the flat surface of the blades should be placed nearest the healthy parts, and if sufficient force be exerted, the cut surface looks as level as if made with a saw. In a hard bone, such as the lower jaw, or in the tibia when it is required to remove a portion of the hard part of the shaft, as in compound fractures, I believe this instrument breaks the bone at the part where it is applied ; in softer bones it partly bruises, as well as cuts. Some theorists have objected to its use from the latter circumstance (bruis- ing) ; but on no occasion, so far as I know, has this instrument produced more serious consequences on the remaining portion of bone, than the saw might have done, had it been used instead. Besides the shape of cutting forceps represented in the sketch on the preceding page, I have for many years been in the habit of using others more conveniently adapted for particular purposes: sometimes I have found that when the blades were curved in this manner (fig. 14) at the point, I could effect with them what I could not with the straight ones ; and in other instances I have had reason to be much satisfied with the bends as here exhibited (figs. 15, 16). I have other shapes, too, most of them being derived from the same “ Armamentarium,” but these I have found most generally useful in all the ordinary operations on bones.

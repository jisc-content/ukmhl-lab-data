THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 280 whilst the fibula remains entire, but in such a case there evidently cannot be much displacement; and in the majority of fractures in this situation, I believe that both bones give way, the fractures being either opposite to each other as is seen in figure 153, or at a consider- able distance, as in figure 154, where the tibia is represented as Fig. 153. Fig. 154. broken a few inches above the ankle, and the fibula near its upper extremity. It is in such an example as this last that the difficulty of detecting the injury of the latter bone is found to be greatest ; and here, too, it may at once be perceived that the accident to the fibula bears a very trifling proportion to the more palpable and formidable fissure in the tibia ; indeed, in this instance the condition of the fibula was not known till examination after amputation, which I performed many weeks after the accident, in consequence of the injurious effects of phlegmonous erysipelas. Figure 151, on the preceding page, was con- sidered a simple fracture above the malleolus externus; gangrene su-

258 THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. The most common kind of dislocation at the ankle, viz., that wherein the foot is thrown outwards, whilst the bones of the leg glide inwards, is represented in figure 136, in which, for the sake of dis- tinctness, the distortion is made to appear more conspicuous, and the separation greater, perhaps, than might be in reality: here it will be observed, that the fibula is broken higher up than in the preceding figures ; such an injury invariably happens in cases of this description (indeed it is not unusual to speak of the case more as one of fracture than of dislocation, however palpable the latter may be), and the malleolu s intcrnus is almost certain to be separated from the tibia. In the drawing it is represented as being still attached to the bone, though there is a slight fissure, but in reality it would probably be retained in its natural position below by the deltoid ligament. The common principles of surgeiy will indicate the necessary pro- ceedings in all these lateral dislocations at the ankle. Gradual ex- tension, the foot being held at a right angle with the leg, with gentle movements at the joint, will enable the surgeon to effect reduction ; and the ordinary precautions to avert or subdue high inflammation being carefully attended to, the parts will, after due time, in a great measure recover their original power of resisting the varied and com- plicated influences under which the ankle-joint is exposed to injuries of the most serious description ; but I shall not dwell longer upon these cases at present, as I have again to allude to them in the chapter on fractures, to which I must refer the reader for further information. Even in most instances of compound dislocation this fortunate result may be looked for, though in occasional examples of the kind the destruction of parts seems so great, and other circumstances are so un- favourable, that amputation appears the safest measure for the patient.

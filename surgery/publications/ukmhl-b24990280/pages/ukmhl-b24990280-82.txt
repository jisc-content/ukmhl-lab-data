The point of the in- strument should be thrust into the matter, and then carried to the desired extent through the textures, by a movement with the extre- mities of the thumb and two first fingers. The edge of the knife may be carried in any direction, and consequently some slight devia- tion from the position of the blade, as here shown, must be attended to. Fi<). 52.

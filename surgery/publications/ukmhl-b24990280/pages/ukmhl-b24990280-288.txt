270 THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. eventually do,) lie will, in some measure, have acquired a slight use of the member,—at all events, he will not suffer as a patient with hip- disease does when the limb is moved, nor will he exhibit the extreme emaciation, and other marks of long-continued irritation, so character- istic of the sufferer from diseased joint; then, there will have been no suppuration,no sinuses, as in the case of spontaneous affection;—but I shall pursue the subject no further at present; and were it not that I had repeatedly seen instances where the wretched victims of hip- disease had been subjected to all the horrors and violence of attempts to return the femur to its proper position,—-as is done with propriety in common luxation from force,—I would not have dwelt so long on a subject with which every tyro should be conversant. Reduction of dislocation on the back of the ilium is seldom attended with great difficulty, though in general a powerful force is required to effect it; in addition, it may be well to relax the muscular action by administering a solution of tartarized antimony, while the patient is kept in a warm bath for half an hour before the operation is com- menced, and during the period of extension the sudden abstraction of fifteen or twenty ounces of blood from a vein in the arm will greatly facilitate the object of the surgeon. One or more of these auxiliary measures may be omitted if the accident is of recent date; but if re- duction is attempted after the lapse of several weeks, they ought in- variably to be resorted to. If the pulleys are at hand they ought always to be applied; for, though manual efforts alone may suffice in some instances, the whole proceedings will be more satisfactorily con- ducted under the steady force which can be brought into play by such a powerful apparatus. The patient, as here represented (fig. 149), should be laid on his uninjured side, on a hair mattress placed on the floor; a table-cloth folded lengthwise should be passed under the peri- neum, and its two ends should be fastened to some firm object in the floor or wall, so as to be somewhat below the level of the patient’s body. To prevent galling, a folded towel should be put between the cloth and the perineum. Another tabic-cloth, similar to the above

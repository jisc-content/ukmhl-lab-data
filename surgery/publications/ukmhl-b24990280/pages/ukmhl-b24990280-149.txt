When all preliminary arrangements such as are required for the dap operation are completed, an assistant should grasp the limb with both hands, and draw the skin upwards, both for the purpose of preserving a portion of it, and also to render the surface tense, or the surgeon may do so with his left hand, whilst with the right he places the knife in the position represented in the accompanying drawing (fig. 54): to do so, he requires to stoop, and bend the hand well backwards. Holding the instrument lightly between the fingers, as here exhibited, or grasping it firmly in the closed palm, he sinks the edge through the skin, draws it deliberately round under the limb, and then over it, gradually changing the bend of the wrist, until the hand is as much bent forwards as it previously was in the opposite direction, and thus completes a circular wound. Whatever bo the extent of natural Fuj. 54. retraction, the integuments should next he drawn upwards by an as- sistant, encircling the limb witli the forefingers and thumbs of both hands; and to facilitate the upward movement, the convex edge of the knife may be applied whenever the attachments seem to require di- vision. Again, the knife should be made to sweep round the limb, as in the first part of the operation, being kept close to the surface of the

THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 310 gastrocnemius will be divided, as well as those of the soleus, and after the division of the latter, the deep aponeurosis alone will inter- vene ; but it is here so thin that it may scarcely attract notice. Considering the irregularities of both the posterior tibial and fibular arteries, I cannot but repeat my objections to attempting these pro- ceedings on the living body, in the upper third of the leg, by the Hunterian operation,—that is, by cutting down on either of the ves- sels above an aneurism or wound: the necessity for doing so on the fibular is, as already stated, scarcely to be imagined, and the same may almost be said regarding the posterior tibial: indeed, I have for many years looked upon such proceedings as appertaining so much to mere dissecting-room displays, that, in my lectures, I have only referred to them because they have been described by the anatomist, more, in my opinion, to show what may be done with correct anatomical know- ledge, than with reference to what might be considered good surgery. In the lower part of the course of the posterior tibial, a ligature may occasionally be required, and this sketch (fig. 169) will show the lines of incision as above directed. Fig. 1G9. Ligature of the popliteal artery is seldom, if ever, performed in the present day. Previous to the introduction of Hunter’s operation on the superficial femoral for aneurism of this vessel (1735), the surgeon was in the habit of cutting into the ham, clearing out the contents of the sac, and tying the artery above and below its communication with the disease; but such a proceeding is now never contemplated for spontaneous disease; and as the vessel is so well protected against injury, it will rarely occur that the surgeon has to secure it for a

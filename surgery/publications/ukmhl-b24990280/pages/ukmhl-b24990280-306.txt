THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 280 seldom much displacement; but in the latter the space between the fragments may be from half an inch to an inch, and, if the treatment be neglected, even this distance may become much greater. In the vertical fracture, the fragments are not under the direct influence of any muscles, unless it be from a few fibres of the vasti, so that what- ever displacement there may be, must arise chiefly from the force which may have occasioned the fracture, or from the effusion into the joint which usually follows this injury. In the transverse fracture the lower fragment keeps its natural position, whilst the upper is separated by the action of the quadriceps extensor: here, too, the separation is often made more extensive by the increase of fluid within the joint. The next drawings exhibit two examples of fracture of this bone. Figure 158 shows a transverse fissure, such as that where separation may become extensive, and the other (fig. 159) is partly oblique and partly vertical. In this specimen ossific union had occurred. Though in these cases the lacerated wound of the joint is always followed by considerable inflammation, swelling, and effusion, it rarely happens that it is permanently disabled j and, so long as there is no external wound, there need be little fear of the result. It will be ob-

Some of these disldcations will be further illustrated in the succeed- ing pages. In general there is little difficulty in detecting the nature of such injuries; nevertheless, either through ignorance or neglect, they are occasionally overlooked until it is too late to remedy the misfortune. Most surgeons must have seen deplorable cases of the kind, and I have met with many.

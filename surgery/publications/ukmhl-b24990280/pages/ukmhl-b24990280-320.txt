THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 302 least idea that the fracture is such that bony union may be reasonably looked for (as in the neck of the bone outside of the capsule), then the use of the apparatus should be persisted in for five or six weeks at least. The double-inclined plane has been recommended in these cases as well as others in the lower extremity, and by some it has been thought advantageous to place both limbs in a similar attitude: the angle of the two planes is made so high, or, in other words, the thigh- boards are made so long, that the pelvis hangs from the knees, as it were ; and, whilst extension is thus kept up, the surgeon has the op- portunity, by keeping the knees together, of ascertaining that both thighs are much about the same length. Instead of using a couple of splints, two boards of wood, of sufficient breadth to sustain both limbs, have been put together at a proper angle, and used on these occasions. The same plan has been sometimes used, too, in fractures of the shaft of the femur; but it is evident that the upper fragment cannot be considered as at all fixed by this apparatus; and when ossific union is expected, I should not be inclined to recommend it, though aware that good cures have followed this method, as well as others. I have noticed that under such treatment the feet and legs have be- come remarkably cedematous, unless well supported by bandages, and there has been altogether such an apparent want of comfort and security in the plan, that, excepting under particular circum- stances, I would never resort to it. It will be remarked that in every fracture of the lower extremity I have invariably recommended the straight position, which, with few exceptions, will, I believe, be found the most satisfactory method ; the surgeon may, however, see good reason occasionally for rejecting it, and, it need scarcely be added, that whichsoever practice is pursued, there is much need of care, both in putting up the limb and in the after-treatment; its length, attitude, and general contour must each and all be carefully attended to ; and I feel satisfied that the sooner all this is done after the injury has happened, so much the better for both patient and surgeon. In pursuing the different plans above advised, I have occasionally found difficulties to be overcome, and deficiencies in the apparatus, which must have been noticed by all who have followed similar methods of practice. For example, in fractures of the tibia* a degree of extension is sometimes re- quired, more particularly in compound cases when the under frag- ment is drawn behind the upper one, which cannot be well ap- plied with JVTlntyre’s splint, whether bent or straight: and, to take another case, when the long single splint is placed on the outside of the limb, it is extremely troublesome to prevent the foot turning out, or the board turning forwards. In fractures of the leg, it is also often difficult to prevent the toes turning inwards or outwards; and it seems to me that the footboard, with the lateral movement such as has been recommended at p. 284, might be advantageously combined with some such simplification of Desault’s as that spoken of

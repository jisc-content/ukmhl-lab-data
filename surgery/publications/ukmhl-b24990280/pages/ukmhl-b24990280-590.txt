572 CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS.

The skin alone should be divided in front, and between the tuberosity and the anus the blade may be carried deeper, although there is less occasion for this in general than some have supposed. The young surgeon is often told to cut freely here, because there is no important texture,— nothing but cellular tissue; but where the stone is not above an aver- age size, there is actually no need of a wide gap in this situation. A free division of the skin, then, I consider a most important fea- ture in the operation; but beyond this the application of the knife should, in my opinion, be extremely limited. The point of the finger may, in general, be thrust without much force into the space between the muscles above named, provided the superficial fascia has been cut; it will.probably be arrested by the lower part of the triangular liga- ment, and some of the fibres of the levator ani; but I believe the groove may be felt through these parts, — they may in a manner be squeezed up against it, and the puncture with the knife as it is earned onwards will usually suffice to admit the point of the fin- ger, which, being accomplished, gives the operator the power of en- larging the wound to any extent he may think necessary. The dotted line in the accompanying drawing (fig. 244) will give an idea of the

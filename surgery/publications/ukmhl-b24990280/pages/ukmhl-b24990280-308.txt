These observations are not made by way of sanctioning any carelessness in the treatment, but rather to prevent the young practitioner giving himself much distress because he cannot bring about a close approxima- tion of the broken surfaces. Some little time ago we had it patient in King's College Hospital, whose limb is accurately represented by the accompany ing figure (160) ; even here, though the condition was Fiy. ItiO. the same in both limbs, the person seemed not to be conscious oi much inconvenience; but it was apparent that he had not the same muscular power in his thighs as he must have had at an earlier period ol life before the injuries happened. 1 he ligament which tonns between the fragments in these cases becomes remarkably strong, more so to all appearance than even the ligamentum patellar, 1 have lately had under my care, in our Hospital, an unusual case ot fracture ol this bone. About five years ago the patient broke the patella, and tin fragments remained an inch separate: on being brought into the house for an injury of the same knee, it was found that the lowei fragment was broken transversely, whilst the newly formed ligament above was uninjured.

OPERATIONS FOR VARICOSE VEINS. 319 branches was fraught with the utmost danger; and notwithstanding the apparent success attending the division of these vessels, as practised by Sir Benjamin Brodie, it seemed to have become at once a settled point, that, excepting under most urgent circumstances, the chief practice to be followed with propriety in varicose veins was that of supporting the vessels and parts by means of bandages or laced stockings. Of late years, however, there has, in my opinion, been ample ground for doubting the correctness of the prevalent doctrines of modern surgery, regarding some injuries of the veins; and though I do not wish to be understood as advocating any useless interference with these vessels, or any carelessness regarding them, in operations on arteries for aneurisms, or during amputations, I do not hesitate to say that the dangers of some of these accidental or intended injuries have been much exaggerated ; and, in illustration, the instances of interference with varicose veins, with which most modern surgeons are now very familiar, maybe referred to. The examples afforded by the practice of Velpeau, Davat, Fricke, and man}â€™ of our own practitioners, clearly evince the rarity of unfortunate results or of dangerous consequences from local inflammation, induced by surgical interference. The discus- sion of such matters does not come within the scope of my present object, but I trust that I have appeared sufficiently explicit in giving my opinion, that far less danger is to be apprehended from injury to varicose veins than the doctrines of twenty years back inculcated. The method of obliterating the enlarged veins by means of needles and threads, as advocated by Velpeau, has now been extensively tried by most of our hospital surgeons ; and having myself resorted to the practice very frequently, I can speak with some degree of precision on its merits. I have found it of most service in examples of enlarge- ment of the saphena (either the internal or the posterior), and some of its most conspicuous branches; and in those instances where the disease affects many of the vessels of the leg, more particularly the minor vessels, which have their course in the cutis vera, I have ob- served less benefit resulting: in such cases the disease often proves to be beyond the aid of active surgical interference ; but in those first referred to, it will often be found of much service, although even here success must not be invariably expected, for it will sometimes happen that some of the veins which have previously been but little affected will speedily assume the size of those already operated on, whilst on other occasions the vessels which have been under treatment, and supposed to be obliterated, will actually continue to carry on the circulation. The operations with the needles may be performed as follows : whilst the patient is in the erect position, the outline of the vessels to be se- lected for the proceedings should be observed; he should then lie down, and the surgeon should pinch up a vein between the fore-finger and thumb of the left hand, with a portion of the skin, and should with his right hand pass a needle, such as that delineated at p. 34, straight across under the vessel; he should next twist a thread

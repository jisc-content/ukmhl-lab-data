THE HEAD AND NECK. 444 terference is required for the purpose of removing foreign substances which get between the lids and ball, or actually penetrate the surface of the latter, such as particles of dust, insects, grains of powder, scales of iron from the blacksmith’s anvil, &c. ; but other rules than those which a knowledge of the anatomy of the organ, the use of instruments on sucii delicate textures, and ordinary mechanical principles will in- dicate, do not seem to require notice here. Sternutatories, and all means likely to excite a copious secretion of tears, may be of much service, by causing the latter to wash the mucous surfaces. Raising the eyelids, using a syringe and tepid water, a camel-hair pencil, or forceps, will usually ensure success. If a cataract has to be removed from the axis of vision, the proceed- ing may be effected in various ways:—that by couching is, perhaps, the most common, and may be accomplished on the living body in the following manner :—The patient should be seated on a chair with a back sufficiently high to permit his head to rest against it, and an as- sistant should be instructed to keep it steady. Then the surgeon should sit or stand in front, according to the height of the seat on which the patient rests: next he should place the fore and middle finger of his right or left hand, as the case may be, upon the margin of the lower eyelid, and whilst pulling it slightly downwards should apply gentle pressure upon the globe with their points, and at the same time the assistant who holds the head should elevate the upper lid by a some- what similar position and use of his fingers : thus these being opposite to those below will serve to keep the cornea uncovered and the ball itself steady: then the operator should pass the point of such a needle as that referred to afterwards into the interior of the eye by piercing the sclerotic about a line’s breadth from the cornea on the outer side of the globe and nearly on a line with the commissures: a slight plunge is required to pass the instrument through the tough tunic, but as soon as it has entered it then passes readily along behind the iris, and when the point is visible through the pupil (which should have been dilated by the previous application of belladonna) it can then be placed against the opaque object, which may now be treated according to circumstances: if the lens be soft the instrument must be carried across it in various directions, and several portions should, if possible, be detached and pushed forwards into the aqueous humour either in the posterior or anterior chamber: if the cataract be hard, then the needle should be pushed against it in such a way as to force it down- wards and backwards into the vitreous humour : if it is thrust almost straight downwards, without any other change of position, the pro- ceeding is usually termed depression; if laid backwards so that its anterior surface is placed uppermost—reclination is the term to denote this manoeuvre, and in either instance it will be observed, that the object is to make a clear passage for the rays of light towards the retina: this being done the instrument should be withdrawn, the eyelids closed, the patient kept quiet in a dark room, and every care taken to avert injurious inflammation, for a severe action of this kind

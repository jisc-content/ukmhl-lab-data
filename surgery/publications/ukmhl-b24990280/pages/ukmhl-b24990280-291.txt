DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. 273 after the pulleys had been used to no purpose. The muscles in some individuals will make greater resistance to extension than in others, and the patient seemingly either cannot or will not relax them ; in almost all, however, long-continued or repeated extension will at last prove superior; and in some persons, after the pulleys have been used for a considerable time, and when perhaps the rope has been relaxed in despair, a kind of collapse will supervene, when the muscles will become so flaccid, that a very slight degree of force, compared with that previously applied, will produce the desired effect. The dislocation of the head of the femur into the sciatic notch, dif- fers in no material practical point from that last referred to: it is caused by much the same kind of violence : the attitude and appear- ance of the limb are in many respects similar, the chief difference being, that the shortening is not so great, though the limb is shorter than its fellow by half an inch or more; that the trochanter and head, especially the latter, are not so distinguishable, or, if they are, they will be perceived to be a little further backwards and downwards than in the other instance; and that in the effort at re- duction the transverse force is particularly requisite from the com- mencement, to facilitate the escape of the head of the bone from the notch, as also to assist in raising it over the margin of the acetabulum. I know of no better method of applying this force than by using a long cloth, which, when passed under the thigh, should, with its ends fastened, be slung round the surgeon's neck, whilst he is in a stooping posture, so that, if he rests his foot on the pelvis and gradually raises his shoulders, his whole strength will, in a manner, be available, if required. I need scarcely point out to my readers that much violence is often necessary in these attempts, and I think it would be incorrect to conceal the fact; for, however easily reduction may be accomplish- ed in some instances, it must have been observed by all who have had much experience in such practice, that in the majority of cases big drops of moisture have stood on the brow of every one actively con- cerned, before success has been attained. When the head of the femur rests on the pubes (fig. 145), the whole limb is everted, the knee is slightly bent, the trochanter is less prominent than natural, and the displaced part can be distinctly felt in the groin under Poupartâ€™s ligament. One would imagine that a displacement of this kind could scarcely be overlooked, yet specimens of false joints formed in such cases are to be found in every museum, and afford convincing proof, either that such injuries are neglected by the patient, or overlooked by the surgeon. The apparatus and extending force applied as described for dislo- cation upwards and backwards, will produce the desired effect in this instance also; and the transverse force, as recommended to assist in raising the head of the femur from the sciatic notch, will here be of equal service ; for, as the patient lies on his side, the thigh-bone re- quires to be lifted upwards, perhaps even a little forwards, as may be imagined from an examination of the cut referred to, into its natural T

For the same reasons, too, the sciences of Chemistry, Pharmacy, Materia Medica, and others, which are included in the curriculum of medical study, have scarcely been referred to ;—not because they are irrelevant to the Practice of Surgery, hut because each, in a manner, forms a separate department of that system of in- struction which belongs alike to the Physician and the Sur- geon, and which every properly qualified medical man must have pursued ere he becomes a recognised practitioner.

DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. Fuj. 147. â€¢267 would have been creditable to sur- limb, between the dislocation and fracture together, was such as to render the patient very miserable, and unfit for all acti\e pedestrian- ism It may be doubted whether in this example the dislocation could have been reduced at the first, in consequence of the injury in the lower part of the thigh; yet it gery had its nature not been over- looked, and had some reasonable attempt been made to remedy the aggravated evil. In the dislocation upwards on the dorsum ilii (fig- 144) the head of the femur is thrust under, into, or, it may be through, the sub- stance of the gluteus minimus muscle, and rests about one inch and a half or two inches above the margin of the cotyloid cavity; the distance being in one example greater, in another less. The fi- gure (147) gives a correct represen- tation in outline, of the distortion of the limb, which appears short- ened and bent at the joints, with the thigh sloping towards its fel- low, the knee touching its lower third, and the great toe in contact with the metatarsal bone of that of the opposite side. The shortening of the limb will vary according to the position of the head of the fe- mur ; and though it is very charac- teristic of the accident, particularly when concomitant with the attitude here delineated, it should not always be relied on as a positive indi- cation of this kind of displacement. The hip itself should be most carefully examined ; and if the injury be such as that under consider- ation, it will readily be perceived that the trochanter major is nearer to the crest and anterior and superior spine of the ilium, than the same process is on the opposite side; and possibly the head of the bone may be felt in its new position: it will be observed, also, that all movements of the thigh on the pelvis are attended with pain and accomplished with difficulty, and that a slight degree of force will neither suffice to extend the limb to the length of its fellow, nor alter the apparent distortion of the hip. The contrast between this injury and that of fracture in the neck of the femur may be fully appreciated by a reference to one of the drawings illustrative of the latter subject, which will be seen in a future

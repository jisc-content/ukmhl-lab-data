163 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. as just represented in figure 72 ; nr it may be driven backwards on the dorsum of the scapula, of which I have seen one well-marked example, which may be understood by this design (fig. / 3). In the latter case, the humerus slopes slightly forwards, and the head of the bone will be felt in its unnatural position under the spine of the scapula; in the former this may also be done, though not so distinctly; and the arm will slope backwards and outwards, as shown in the sketch : in both the deficiency under the acromion, the history of the accident, as well as the general marks of dislocation, will indicate the nature of the injury. Dislocations of the shoulder-joint may be reduced in a great variety of ways; but, as it would be inconsistent with the nature of this work to describe or even refer to them all, I shall merely speak of those which I consider most worthy of attention. One of the most simple methods of reducing dislocation of the shoulder-joint is as follows :â€”The patient should be seated on a chair, a table-cloth or sheet, folded to the breadth of eight or ten inches, placed around the chest, its middle being close under the injured part, and its two ends given to an assistant standing on the oppo- site side; another cloth should be fixed by the middle on the arm immediately above the elbow, and its ends entrusted to another assist- ant ; the surgeon, placing himself behind the arm, should lay hold of the extremity in such a way as to bend the elbow, and move the humerus in a rotatory direction on its long axis, whilst the two as- sistants are engaged, the one in keeping the body steady, the other

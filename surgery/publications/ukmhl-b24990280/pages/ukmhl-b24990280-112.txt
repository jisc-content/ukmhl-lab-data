.94 HEMORRHAGE. if it be large, these means are not to be trusted to ; the ligature will alone give assurance of safety. The pressure should be applied directly on the bleeding point, by graduated compresses and bandages; and it will be of advantage, too, if pressure be put on the main artery, or arteries leading to the aper- ture, as on the humeral, radial, and ulnar, in wounds deep in the hand, or in puncture of the humeral during venesection. In some parts of the body, as at the root of the neck, the surgeon cannot do otherwise than trust to pressure, and often has he the fatal proof of its inade- quacy. When the stream is profuse, he may, on certain occasions, as in a stump, at once see the propriety of resorting to other measures. Perhaps there may be difficulty in deciding on the proper part for the application of a ligature. The occurrence may, in general, be taken as sufficient proof, that there has been little disposition towards the ad- hesive process, and that, at all events, ulceration, and other unhealthy actions, are going forward in the seat of hemorrhage: in such a case, then, it will be advisable to place a ligature on the principal vessel of the limb, at a considerable distance from the orifice;â€”in a stump in the leg, for example, the femoral artery should be tied in the mid- dle, or upper third, of the thigh. The impetuosity of the current is thus stemmed: much less pressure will check the further flow of blood from the orifice (if, indeed, there be any): more healthy action may go on in and around the bleeding vessel, and adhesion, granulation, and cicatrization, may at last close up the parts. In such a case, there may be secondary hemorrhage from the seat of the ligature, and in this event the best skill may be of little avail. The obser- vations on secondary hemorrhage after ligature of the superficial femoral artery, which will be found in a future part of the work, may serve to guide the surgeon under such difficult circumstances.

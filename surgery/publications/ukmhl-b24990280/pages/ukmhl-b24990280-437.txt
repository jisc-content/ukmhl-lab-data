419 DISSECTION OF HEAD, NECK, AND THROAT. particular on certain points of the anatomy in describing the operations on the eyeball and its appendages. Now the skin or mucous membrane of the lids should he removed in such a manner as to display the cartilages: then the lachrymal sac may be exposed, and in doing so the tendon of the orbicular muscle may he noticed immediately in front of it, and a little be- low the course of the inferior lachrymal duct. A bristle or a small silver probe can he passed into the latter: the same should be done in the upper, and perhaps, too, it may he well to carry in the manner afterwards described (p. 441) a curved probe from the nose up the nasal duct into the sac, which may then be opened, and, the probe being withdrawn, another may he pushed downwards into the nostril. The saw should now he applied to the lower jaw, a little to one side of the symphysis, and then at the anterior margin of the masseter : a common hand-saw will answer well for the purpose, hut I strongly recommend the student to practise with the small instruments, such as are represented afterwards in the chapter on operations in this situa- tion : the cutting forceps may here be advantageously brought into use also, and thus some experience may he acquired in the application of such instruments to these parts. A notch should first be made in each place above directed, the forceps should then he used to divide the inner plate, and so the portion being loose should next be sepa- rated by dividing the buccinator, the mucous membrane, and mylo- hyoid muscle. Before the saw is applied on these occasions it will he proper to remove two of the teeth, should they appear to he in the way. The submaxillary gland may now be fully examined (if this has not already been done), and its duct (Whartonâ€™s) may be traced, by passing a probe or bristle into it, up to its opening beside the fraenum lingum : the sublingual gland will now also be perceived, between the tongue and the mylo-hyoid, and next the genio-hyoid and the genio- glossus muscles may he dissected, and their attachments to the genial processes examined : on the side of the tongue the fibres of the stylo- glossus may be observed intermingling, as it were, with those of the hyo-glossus. When the masseter has been satisfactorily examined, it should be separated from the zygomatic arch, and also from the jaw, when the inferior attachment of the temporal muscle will be brought into view : the fibres should then be dissected from the coronoid process, or, what will be better, the bone should be divided vertically in a line from the base, where it has already been cut, passing directly in front of the condyle, and thus the process will be removed, when by a little further use of the knife the external and internal pterygoid muscles may be displayed : the former will be observed attached to the neck, the latter to the surface on the inner side of the bone opposite to the lower insertion of the masseter: to display either the bone must be twisted to one or other side, as may be required. In making the dissection it will be impossible to overlook the upper part of the external carotid, and its division into the temporal and

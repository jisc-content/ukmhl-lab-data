154 THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. wards the palm as the only kind which he has met with, and has advised that unless the reduction could he easily accomplished, the parts should be let alone. I have not met with any example of this kind, but have seen several where the end had slipped backwards: in two cases the injury having been occasioned by strong resistance at the distal extremity of the bone. There is little difficulty in reducing the projecting point, but there is much in keeping it in its proper place. I have seen a splint and roller fail in doing so. When it shows a tendency to slip out of its situation, a strong narrow bit of pasteboard should be laid along the lower extremity of the radius, over the entire length of the metacarpal bone, and be retained by means of a bandage for the space of three weeks, when the best pos- sible chance will thus be given for the parts keeping their natural position. The bones of the carpus are but rarely separated from each other, and only when great force is applied. In many such cases amputa- tion will probably be required; yet it may occasionally be good prac- tice to attempt to save the hand, after removing one or more of the loose and perhaps shattered bones. The os magnum is sometimes thrust backwards, however, without fatal injury being done to the Fig. 62. neighbouring parts. In such a case, if the bone cannot be at once pushed into its proper place by the surgeonâ€™s thumb, no other attempt should be made, lest it aggravate the evil, by inducing inflammation and caries of the carpal bones. I have seen amputation above the wrist required in consequence of injudicious interference in such an instance. I have known of one example, in which the pisiform bone

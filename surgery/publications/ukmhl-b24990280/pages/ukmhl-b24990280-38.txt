Some consider it advantageous to compress as near to the place of operation as possible, in the likeli- hood of less blood being lost than when done at a distance ; the prin- ciple is a good one, when judiciously acted on; but, in attempting to put it into effect, care must be taken that no impediment is cast on the due performance of the operation,—as by preventing a proper retraction of the soft parts, and, also, that the pressure is not applied in a situation where it will be of little or no avail. In the generality of instances, I prefer having the pressure applied

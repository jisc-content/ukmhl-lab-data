PREFACE. VI11 been omitted, and the descriptions have been arranged more with a view to encourage ocular inspection than to facilitate the prevalent, baneful, and schoolboy system of acquiring names from printed lessons,—a kind of knowledge which is totally worthless to the Practical Surgeon : no special atten- tion has been given to that laboured style of certain treatises on surgical anatomy, which, in describing minute divisions and subdivisions of regions has, it is feared, induced the Stu- dent to suppose that these imaginary, or, at best, artificial lines, are of equal importance with the relative position and appearance of the organs and textures themselves.

The section in question is, like the others, devoted almost exclusively to practical details, and the author hopes that it will be taken in this light alone by the Student and all who may look into these pages,—for, strictly speaking, the true elements of Practical Surgery are to be found chiefly in a complete system of education. Each subject has been treated according to the author’s estimation of its utility and importance, and this estimation has been founded partly on his own education, partly on the writings of others, but more particularly on his experience among pupils, among surgeons of his own age, and among his seniors in the profession ; and he has assumed that his personal opportunities have been such as to entitle him, on all fitting occasions, to illustrate his precepts by his own practice, al- though he must here express a hope, that in the following pages he will not be found deficient in respect for the opinions of others. The limited extent of the work has necessarily prevented notice being taken of many subjects which are of interest to the Practical Surgeon, and also of those historical details which

PART V. OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. CHAPTER I. CHEST. DISSECTIONS. DISLOCATIONS. FRACTURES. OPERATIONS. The chest presents fewer features of interest to the surgeon than most other regions of the body. There are no points of surgical ana- tomy which may not, on a glance or thought, be appreciated by any one acquainted with what is usually called descriptive anatomy. To follow out the arrangements of other parts of this volume, however, I shall make a few observations on the dissection of this region, and then on those matters of surgical interest which I deem worthy of notice on such an occasion. The mode of dissecting the broad muscles behind and in front has already been described in the section on the Superior Extremity, and supposing that the deeper examination is now contemplated, it may be conducted in the following manner:â€”The subject should be placed on its face, with a block under the chest, and the remaining muscles on the back of the spine may be examined. The sacro-lum- balis, longissimus dorsi, spinalis dorsi, will be easily displayed ; but be- fore they can be seen, the serrati must be cut across with the aponeurosis extending between them ; and in the lumbar region the strong tendinous structure, from which the latissimus dorsi mayhave alreadybeen separat- ed in the dissection of the upper extremity, should now be laid open, to expose the united portions of the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi. The slips, in connexion with the upper ends of these (cervicalis as- cendens and tranversalis colli) may next be displayed, as also, the lower part of the complexus; but as these, with the semispinalis, the multi- fidus, and other smaller muscles in this situation, present no remark- able features of surgical interest, it is not necessary to occupy space upon them at present. Now, however, that the posterior aspect of the

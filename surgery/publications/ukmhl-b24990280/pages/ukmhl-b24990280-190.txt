172 THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. Fig. 78. chest; a pad must also he placed upon the outer extremity of the clavicle, which must be covered by some turns of the roller, so as to assist in fixing it in its proper situation. These means, however, combined with keeping the arm steady in a sling, will in all likeli- hood not have the desired effect; and, moreover, the pain which the injury occasions, is not so great as to induce the patient to submit to the irksomeness of a continued application of such an apparatus. Unless the displacement be considerable, I believe it will be the best plan in most instances to leave the shoulder alone, and merely to keep the fore-arm in a sling. When the inner extremity of the clavicle is luxated, a plan similar to that above described may be pursued, a pad being placed over this end of the bone (should the case require it), instead of the outer. Here, also, it is extremely difficult to keep the extremity in its proper seat. A false joint will most probably be the result, and fortunately in this instance, as in the preceding, this condition is productive of no serious inconvenience. The next cut (fig. 79) exhibits the most com- mon displacement of the inner end of the clavicle ; the end, however, may be more in front of the sternum. I once saw a case of displacement of the inner extremity of this bone in a newly-born infant, which had happened during birth. 1 he end rested in front of the sternum, and could be pushed into its pro-

] 8 INSTRUMENTS, DISSECTIONS, AND OPERATIONS. Fig. 19. A director (fig. 19) is sometimes of use, partly as a probe, and partly to guide a cutting instrument in a desired course. It may very generally be dispensed with, as the finger is much to be preferred even in cases where this instrument is by some considered absolutely necessary, as, for example, in cutting the stricture in hernia, on which occasion the finger is the best and safest guide for the bistoury. I have known a surgeon push a director into the gut in this operation, and thus inflict an injury by using it, which it was his object to avoid with the point of the bistoury. There are instances, however, where it will be highly proper to use this instrument; and, on many occasions, it will be found service- able, in permitting a tolerably free escape of matter through its groove, when it has been thought advis- able to open an abscess by a puncture : indeed, some have recommended an instrument of a similar construc- tion with a shaip point, called an “ exploring needle,” to be thrust into swellings of doubtful nature, so as to allow of blood or matter, if either be present, to flow along the groove. On such occasions, 1 am in the habit of passing a bistoury into the seat of disease, and by gently turning it half round on its long axis, I make a sufficient opening to permit the exit of a few drops of blood or matter; or, should there be any apparent ob- struction, I then pass the common director along the flat surface of the blade, which is next withdrawn, whilst the matter, if any be present, is evacuated through the groove. This instrument is generally made of silver, of the shape and appearance here ex- hibited, and between four and five inches in length. The handle may either be flat, of a triangular shape, or in the resemblance of a small oblong spoon, like that in the sketch.

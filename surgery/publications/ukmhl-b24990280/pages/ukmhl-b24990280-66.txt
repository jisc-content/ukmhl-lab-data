INFLAMMATION. 48 As a counter-irritant, I place less reliance on the seton than other means already mentioned, but as a direct irritant I esteem it highly; thus, in certain erectile tumours, in sinuses, and in hydrocele, I deem it of much value: its application in these cases will be more appropriately considered in other parts of this volume. CHAPTER VIII INFLAMMATION. The practical surgery of this work will be found, chiefly in those pages, where the injuries and diseases of the different regions of the body are considered ; but certain general principles of treatment are so universally applicable, as to induce me to refer to them at the present stage of our progress; thus saving the necessity of frequent repetitions, and also being more in accordance with the nature of an introduction. The treatment of inflammation and its consequences constitutes a large and important share of the practice of surgery, and as the disease is met with under so many different aspects and circum- stances, even in the ordinary routine of the surgeon’s duty, each probably requiring certain modifications, or perhaps decided alter- ations of practice, I shall now, in accordance with the plan of this work, proceed with such practical remarks on the kinds of inflam- mation likely to be met with in the diseases and injuries which it is my intention to treat of in the following pages, as may elu- cidate my own practice, and guide the young surgeon, until he has acquired sufficient experience to act on his own resources. The common divisions of inflammation into acute, chronic, simple, and specific, answer sufficiently well for general purposes of illus- tration, although it is often difficult to determine the accuracy of these appellations. The terms “ acute,” and “ chronic,” in their ordinary acceptation, clearly indicate that in one case the phe- nomena of the disease are all developed rapidly, in another slowly; yet practitioners do not in all instances agree on the distinctions "which may be thought to constitute acute or chronic action. For example, when inflammation attacks the female mamma, particularly during the period of lactation, and when, in the course of a few days, a large quantity of pus is formed, and from the first attack up to the period of suppuration all the symptoms of inflammation have been well-marked, the meaning of the term “ acute,” can scarcely be misunderstood; but, on the other hand, a swelling may form in the same part, progress slowly, and, after the lapse of months, within a couple of days, perhaps, there may be every evidence

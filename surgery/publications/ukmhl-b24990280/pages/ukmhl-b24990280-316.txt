THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 298 limb is not always present, as there may be fracture without displace- ment. There is in my collection a fracture through the cervix femoris, yet during life there was no shortening, no eversion, and, moreover, no crepitus. Sometimes, instead of eversion, there has been inver- sion ; but this is exceedingly rare, and occasionally, though, perhaps, with equal rarity, the toes have been seen at one period turned out, and at another turned in, in the same case. Most of these symptoms are equally apparent in fractures through the trochanters, and also in the neck of the bone immediately above, as in instances within the capsular ligament; and if there be great obesity, or much swelling from effusions and inflammation, it will be impossible to detect the exact seat of fracture: but in some cases, as with thin old women immediately after the accident, the shaft of the bone can be so distinctly traced, in its entire condition, to the top of the trochanter, that, if there be fracture at all, it must be near the head; and if the circumstances and symptoms are as I have stated them above, there can scarcely be a doubt that the injury is within the capsule :â€”I say within; for, though it may be entirely outside, or partly within and partly without, and whether or not the fragments are still held together more or less firmly by the reflected ligament within the capsule, the practical deduction should be, that the fracture is one which in all likelihood will never unite by bone. I know of no authority so much to be relied on for the truth of this doctrine as that of Sir Astley Cooper, who, in referring to his own vast experience ranging over a period of forty years, after having seen two hundred and twenty-five cases of supposed fracture in the neck of the thigh-bone, and examining many preparations of the kind obtained from his own practice and that of others, states, that in these examinations he had only met with one example in which a bony union had taken place in transverse fracture of the cervix femoris entirely within the capsular ligament. Sir Astley, like other good authorities, though he does not deny the possibility of union in such a case, doubts its probability ; and the truth of the latter circum- stance is so incontestably proved by numerous specimens in our different museums, that it seems almost wonderful how so much should have been said and written to make the fact apparent. Like many of my contemporaries, I have seen several well-marked examples of ossific union in the neck of the femur; but there is always a doubt whether, in these cases, the fracture was entirely within the ligament or only partially so; and whether, even in bearing the marks of having been in such a situation, the reflected ligament and periosteum had been entirely divided. In the event of either of these mem- branes being more or less entire, it will be perceived that there is more chance of union, than when they are completely tom through ; for, in the latter event, the only remaining course for circulation in the head of the bone is through the round ligament, and the vessels in this narrow channel may be deemed as only of sufficient size to support the vitality of the part, but not to add new growth.

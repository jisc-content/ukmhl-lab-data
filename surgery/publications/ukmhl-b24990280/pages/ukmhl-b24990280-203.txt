J 85 FRACTURES OF THE SCAPULA. ing down of the head of this bone, the inability to move the ann without great pain, more particularly when it is twisted back- wards, and the presence of crepitus, all conduce to the suspicion of the nature of the case. I have known an instance where the coracoid process of this bone was broken, and drawn downwards by the combined action of the pectoralis minor, coraco-brachialis, and biceps muscles: nothing could be done to keep the process in its natural position. Fig. 91 gives an example of this kind. The acro- mion process may be broken, but the accident is of rare occurrence. I have dissected a number of examples of apparent fracture of the end of this process; but in such instances it is doubtful if the movable portion had ever been fixed to the rest of the bone. Whilst the acromion may be said to prevent extensive dislocation of the head of the humerus upwards, the round head of this bone may, in like man- ner, be deemed a preventive to any part of the process being driven downwards. This may probably be the reason why the acromion is so seldom broken. The body of the scapula may be split in any direc- tion ; the fissure is usually transverse, and below the spine : the frac- ture is somewhat rare, but there is nothing in its nature or treatment calling for particular comment here. The various lines in the draw- ing (fig. 92) will point out the ordinary position ef some of the fis- Fig. 92. sures here referred to. A flannel roller round the chest usually con- stitutes the mechanical appliance, and when the neck of the bone is supposed to be the seat of injury, the treatment may be similar to

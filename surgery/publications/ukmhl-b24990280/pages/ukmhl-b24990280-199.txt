FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. 181 Fiij. 88. nevertheless, did for a month), I found the bone had been fractured immediately above the condyles, and that a fissure extended through the articular surface into the joint; yet the fragments had united as favourably as if every possible care had been taken of them by means of apparatus. Not long ago I had a case in King’s College Hospital of compound fracture immediately above the condyles. A small wound on the skin seemed to communicate with the joint, and severe inflammation en- sued. The case, nevertheless, did well, though I found it requisite, about a month after the receipt of the injury, to remove by incision a portion of the external condyle which had become necrosed. In all fractures in this situation, or in the upper part of the fore-arm, I should strongly recommend the bent position at first, and that after the lapse of three weeks or a month gentle movements should be com- menced, to obviate stiffness, which is very apt to follow such injuries. Fracture may occur in any part of the humerus above the line exhibited in figure 87 ; indeed this bone suffers more frequently about its middle than elsewhere, and the nature of the injury may in gene- ral be most readily detected; the swelling and distortion of the arm, its diminished length, should the fragments ride over each other, and the crepitus, will all he distinct. The dark line in the drawing (fig. 89) exhibits a common seat of fracture in the upper end of this bone, where, I believe, it is most frequently seen in persons advanced in years. Whether the fracture be lower down than the insertions of the muscles which form the anterior and posterior boundaries of the axilla,—a little higher between these muscles and the tuberosities in the surgical neck, or between these prominences and the head,—in

THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 184 much active or vigorous use of the arm, whether as much ad- vantage will result as will compensate for the necessary annoyance and restraint of such treatment. I lately saw a case of fracture in the surgical neck of the humerus in an old woman, a patient in King’s College Hospital, in whom the pad in the axilla and bandage occasioned alarming (edema in the hand and fore-arm, and otherwise caused both patient and all of us much trouble. Finding that there was no disposition to much displacement, I removed all the trappings, and let her keep the 'extremity in that position she found most agreeable. This proceeding added greatly to her comfort, for she was bedridden with a fracture in the upper part of the thigh, which befel her at the same time. In three weeks union seemed to have taken place, and she made some use of the arm. Some weeks afterwards this patient died, and on dissecting the shoulder, I found the fragments firmly united, and in most excellent apposition. The scapula is occasionally the seat of fracture. The glenoid cavity may be broken into various fragments,—a rare kind of injury, of which, however, there is an excellent specimen at Fort Pitt, exhi- biting several fissures crossing the articular surface: sometimes it is separated from the body of the bone at the neck, and in either in- stance, it may be difficult to detect the nature of the case. In the Fig. 91. first, I should doubt if it would be possible to discover the injury : in the latter, the patient will have fallen, or have received a severe blow on the shoulder. The absence of all characteristic marks of dislocation, the humerus being distinctly felt through its whole course, and, when rotated, ascertained to be sound, the slight fall-

DISSECTIONS OF THE NECK. 379 The oesophagus should be laid open, and its commencement behind the cricoid cartilage having been noticed, it should be dissected from the trachea. The position of the epiglottis should next attract attention, and the relations which it bears to the upper opening of the larynx, diming different movements of the tongue, should be observed. Then, by looking into the upper part of the larynx, the opening formed by the fold of mucous membrane passing on each side between the aryte- noid cartilages will be noticed, and a little lower down, the proper vocal chords, forming the rima glottidis, with the pouch on each side between these and the folds first seen, may also be observed. The mem- branous part of the trachea behind, cricoid cartilage, and the soft tex- tures between the arytenoid cartilages, should now be slit open with the scissors, when the folds of mucous membrane already alluded to, with the pouch, or ventricle, on each side, may be more accurately ex- amined. The space between the cricoid cartilage and the thyroid should again be looked at: it will be observed to be of greater ex- tent transversely than vertically; and if the scalpel is thrust through the membrane from without inwards, the point may be seen below the anterior attachments of the vocal chords. The space between the thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone may next be noticed: the point of the instrument, if passed from without inwards here will be found between the larynx and the epiglottis, and if it be pushed in above the hyoid bone, it will usually be noticed between the latter part and the tongue. The thyroid gland may next be dissected from the trachea, when its isthmus will, in general, be found to have covered two, or perhaps three, of the rings of the trachea: as, however, the size of this organ, both here and in its lobes, varies exceedingly, the whole gland may be more prominent than the beginner may suppose it to be in accordance with a normal condition. As it is not my object to give a minute description of these parts, I must refer those who wish to inspect them in this way to a work on Anatomy, and shall now proceed with the practical illustration and application of the mode of dissection here described,â€”leaving the dis- section of the Head and Face for a future chapter.

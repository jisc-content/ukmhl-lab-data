21(3 THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. viously ; but certainly in this instance, as in many others treated in a similar manner, I have not heard any complaints on this score, and the patient, whose hand is now exhibited, was not aware, after the lapse of two years, of any material difference in the power of grasping with either organ. I have occasionally observed that if some care is not bestowed on the dressing, the fingers may be made to cross each other at the points ; and sometimes, also, I have noticed that if too little bone was removed, there was a slight prominence on the back of the hand, Both of these conditions are observable in this hand (fig. 112) from which I removed the middle finger, but with too small a portion of the metacarpal bone. By applying the cutting forceps sufficiently high, and afterwards taking care to keep the remaining fingers parallel with each other, these objections may be obviated.

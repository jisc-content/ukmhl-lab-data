THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 162 this description, I have found the parts as I have stated ; the cap- sular ligament has been extensively torn, with part of the tendon* of the subscapular muscle; in one instance, the supra-spinatus was greatly stretched ; in another, the tuberosity, into which the tendon of this muscle is inserted, was tom off; in all the axillary vessels and nerves were slightly on the stretch, and in none of these was the cir- cumflex nerve torn. In some examples of this dislocation of old standing, I have found it impossible to trace this nerve throughout its course, as it seemed to have been ruptured at the time of the acci- dent : in others again, I have traced it with great ease. In the former I have particularly remarked the atrophied condition of the deltoid muscle, whilst in the latter the diminution in bulk has not been more than might have been expected, as the result of restricted movements in the joint. The features of this accident are in general so well marked, that it might be supposed impossible to overlook its nature. This is, how- ever, too frequently the case. The history of the accident, the immo- bility of the limb, the pain in the armpit, numbness of the fingers, with (in some instances) oedematous swelling in the hand, the separa- tion of the elbow from the side, the increased length from the acro- mion to the olecranon, and, above all, the flatness of the shoulder, with the prominence in the axilla, should sufficiently point out what is wrong. The head of the humerus is occasionally thrown inwards and up- wards, so as to rest under the pectoralis major muscle, and to be in contact with the pectoralis minor and coracoid process of the scapula,

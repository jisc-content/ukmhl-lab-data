Fig. 8. 8 Fig. 7. INSTRUMENTS, DISSECTIONS, the right during operations, in securing arteries, from the greater fa- cility7â€™ in manipulating with this hand. A variety of hooks, sharp or blunt at the point, may he used in place of forceps, hut the latter is generally preferred. In dissections the chain-hooks here represented (fig. 7) will often he found of ser- vice; but if the parts can he put on the stretch with the thumb and fingers, or between the forceps and little finger of the left hand (the instrument being held between the thumb and fore-finger), their use had better be dispensed with, as the fingers often get scratched with their points. Instead of these, a hook fixed in a handle like that of a scalpel, as here exhibited (fig. 8), may be had recourse to ; its point it will be observed is sharp, and it is often of advantage to have it so, whilst on other occasions a blunt point is to be preferred, such as in fig. 9, and either of them may be single, as they are here repre- sented, or double, as is seen in fig. 10. The hooks set in handles are mostly used during operations, and then they are held by as- sistants ; they are of service in keeping parts out of the way of the surgeon, and there are few operations in which they can be dispensed with. They take up less room than fingers on the edge of a wound, and generally hold the parts more securely. Slips of copper bent at

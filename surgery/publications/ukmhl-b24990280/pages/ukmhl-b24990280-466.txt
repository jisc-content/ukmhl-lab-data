THE HEAD AND NECK. 448 superior rectus have been divided on such occasions, with probably part, if not the whole, of the superior oblique. It has rarely hap- pened that the squint has not been relieved in such instances, but in some the internal rectus of the other eye has been divided. Not- withstanding the proximity of the eyeball, as also extensive expo- sure of the sclerotic, it has seldom occurred that serious injurv has Fig. 204. been done at the time, or that bad results have followed. I have myself seen one instance only where injurious inflammation and sloughing ensued, and have heard of a case where the sclerotic was punctured, though doubtless more damage may have been done than has come to light. The same instructions may answer for almost every form of strabis- mus ; but manj- other modes of operating have been preferred : thus, instead of scissors a small curved knife has been used to open the conjunctiva, then a curved director has been carried behind the tendon, which has been divided by running the knife along the groove ; or sometimes the tendon has been elevated on a blunt hook, and then cut with a knife or scissors; but I shall not attempt to de- scribe all the modifications that have been proposed, and shall only state my conviction, that the operation may be well accomplished in half a dozen different ways at least, and with as many different instruments; each, or all, being selected more, perhaps, to please the fancy of the operator, than from possessing any remarkable superiority.

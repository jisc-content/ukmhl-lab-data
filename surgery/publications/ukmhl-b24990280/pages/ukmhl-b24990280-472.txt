THE HEAD AND NECK. 454 been destroyed, and the vomer had separated by necrosis. Here I imagined that a modification of the proceeding of the Berlin professor might be advantageously resorted to, and accordingly proceeded thus : The patient being seated, the point of a small scalpel was introduced under the apex, and the aim were separated from the parts under- neath ; next the knife was carried on each side between the skin and the bones, as far as the infra-orbital foramen, taking care not to interfere with the nerves, when by passing the point of my finger below the nose, I caused the latter organ to be as prominent as could be wished. I now pushed a couple of long silver needles, which had been prepared for the purpose, with round heads and steel points, across from one cheek to the other, having previously applied on each side a small piece of sole-leather perforated with holes at a proper distance ; then I cut off the steel points, and with tweezers so twisted the end of each needle as to cause the cheeks to come closer to each other, and thus render the nose prominent. Figure 207 further eluci- Fig. 207. dates the proceeding. Thus, by bringing the cheeks more into the mesial line, a new foundation, as it were, was given to the organ.

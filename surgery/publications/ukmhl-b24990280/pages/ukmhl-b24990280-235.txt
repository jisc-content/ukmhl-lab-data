AMPUTATION OF FINGERS. 217 Fig. 115. the same time. On the fore and little finger I generally prefer the latter mode, and in such cases I extend the incision a little higher, by such a line as that exhibited in figure 113. For such an operation the point of the knife should first be applied over the back and middle of the metacarpal bone, then carried downwards along the side and under surface of the joint, and up again to meet that first made, as indicated by the dotted lines ; after this the soft parts nearest the bone must be divided, and then the forceps may be used in such a manner as to cut the bone obliquely, so that there shall be no angular projection. The wound need not be so near the middle of the hand as here exhibited, for if it is placed more between the finger and thumb, the cicatrix will be less conspicuous. Figure 114 represents the hand of one of my patients after such an operation. Fig. 114. In the fore-finger, if the upper end of the metacarpal bone is sound, I should certainly make a point of saving it, for various reasons which must be obvious to any one acquainted with the anatomy of the hand; and in the little finger I should also feel inclined to save the upper end of the bone if I found it in a healthy state ; but, to lessen the chance of its extremity being observable, I would cut it across obliquely as above-mentioned. The operation should be done in a manner similar to that on the fore-finger last described, and the hand will present such an appearance as that exhibited in figure 115, which may be considered as directly in contrast with figure 116, immediately following, where the end of the bone has been preserved.

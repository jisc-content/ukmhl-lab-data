.570 THE CHEST, .ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. introduce the forceps (fig. 241) along the upper surface of the finger, slowly withdrawing the latter as the former make progress: their en- trance will be denoted by a gush of urine, at which instant the blades should be expanded, and now, in all probability, may be closed upon the stone; extraction should then be effected by a slow zigzag move- ment ; and this being done, the operation is completed. It may be well, however, to examine the inte- rior of the bladder, in case of other concretions being present, and this may be done with the point of the finger, with a common sound, or with such an instrument as is re- presented below (fig. 242), which is technically called a searcher; if others are present, they must also be extracted ; then the patient being unbound, should be carried to bed, desired to lie principally on his back, occasionally permitted to rest on his right side, and the future treatment must be conducted ac- cording to circumstances. Some- Fig. 241.

Each stage of the operation and each instrument require some se- parate consideration. It is recommended that the staff should be in- troduced as the first step,â€”chiefly because it can be more easily passed before the patient is bound, and also because it is satisfactory to touch the stone before going further. Unless the calculus be large and pal- pable, and this has been well ascertained before, the surgeon should never cut into the bladder until he feels the concretion when the pa-

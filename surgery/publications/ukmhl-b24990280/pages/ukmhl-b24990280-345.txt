327 RUPTURE OP TENDO ACHILLIS. Fig. 176. of talipes equinus, by the application of force after the division of the tendo Achillis, the heel may be immediately brought into its pro- per place; but the sudden alteration in all the textures gives much annoyance to the patient, and it therefore seems better to produce the change gradually, although in such a case the extending apparatus should, in my opinion, be applied from the first. Fig. 177. Whilst practising division of the tendo Achillis on the dead subject, there will be good proof given of the immediate effect of the accidental rupture or division of this part on the living body : the heel can then be brought further down, whilst the toes can be more freely elevated.

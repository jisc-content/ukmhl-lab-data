511 LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. Fuj. thread being fastened in the usual way, and the wound closed with a couple of stitches and straps, the operation is completed. If the opening in the fascia transversal is is made close upon Pou- part’s ligament, the peritoneum will scarcely be disturbed. There is some advantage in this ; but, on the other hand, the epigastric artery may be in the way—it has, in fact, been wounded in such a case,— and, besides, by securing the artery so very low down, the proximity of the retrograde current of blood through this vessel might possibly prevent the closure of the main artery: it will, therefore, be better even to disturb the peritoneum by stripping it off the vessel some- what higher, and there need be the less hesitation about this, as ex- perience has shown that little additional danger is occasioned thereby. The proceedings above described resemble in most respects those recommended by Sir Astley Cooper, but the external incision may be, if it is thought proper, carried more parallel with the course of the ar- tery, as practised by Abemethy in his first operation. The peritoneum is, however, in greater danger in the latter method, and most authori-

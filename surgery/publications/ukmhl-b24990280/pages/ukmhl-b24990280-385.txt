PART IV. OF THE HEAD AND NECK. CHAPTER I. DISSECTIONS OF THE NECK. The dissection of the head and neck may he conducted on the same subject as that on which the superior extremity was examined. If, h owever, another and a better can be procured, it may be well to take the advantage. The posterior part of the neck presents so little that is interesting to the surgical anatomist, that only a brief space of time need be devoted to the dissection. The body should be placed in the position described at p. 146, when, if the skin has not yet been taken off the trapezius, an incision should be made from the spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra to the acromion process of the scapula, another should next be carried from the point first named upwards to the occipital tube- rosity, and from this a third should be made to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The skin and cellular membrane may then be dissected towards the side of the neck, so as to expose the whole of the upper end of the trapezius, a portion of the sterno-mastoid and part of tlie splcnius. In this stage of the dissection there is nothing of much surgical consequence. It may be noticed that there is less fat immediately under the skin than in some other regions; that the cellular texture is in considerable quantity, but dense and fibrous. The occipital artery may be observed midway between the occipital protuberance and mastoid process, emerging from below the splcnius capitis, in its course towards the scalp. I need not describe the mode of dissecting the muscles on the back of the neck for surgical purposes. As the student takes off each layer attached to the cranium, he may observe that beneath the line leading from the occipital protuberance to the mastoid process the occipital bone is so covered with muscular attachments, that it would be almost impossible from any external examination to detect fractures in this

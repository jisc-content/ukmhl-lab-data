THE HEAD AND NECK. ■184 involving the deeper parts of the bone, as that referred to and deline- ated in Mr. Liston’s Practical Surgery, where the diseased mass ex- tended from the eyebrow to below the level of the lower jaw, and yet the textures behind were not implicated ; for the entire disease, weigh- ing several pounds, was most successfully extirpated, and, in my opi- nion, with greater facility too, than I have observed with others of a less formidable size. In Dupuytren's collection of diseased bones there are several remarkable examples of large growths in the superior maxilla, some unconnected with the parts behind, others extensively so, and some involving a considerable portion of the frontal; some of these are exhibited in the published catalogue of the preparations; but indeed there are few museums now-a-days which do not contain ex- amples of the kind. Supposing a tumour connected with the upper-jaw of a larger size than that for which I have yet described an operation, and that a pro- ceeding of the kind is necessary, it may be accomplished in the follow- ing manner: The patient being seated with his head as previously de- scribed, an incision should be made from the margin of the upper-lip towards the nostril, and then from the ala, as high as within half an inch of the inner canthus of the eyelids ; next the cheek should be laid open from the angle of the mouth (or near it) as far as the zygo- matic process of the malar bone, and, if necessary, an incision at right angles with this one should extend from the external angular process of the frontal bone, towards the neck of the lower jaw ; now the flap between the nose and the wound in the cheek should be dissected from off the tumour, and turned upwards on the brow; then that portion of the cheek below and behind the wound should be turned downwards, and the mucous membrane divided, so as to expose freely the interior of the mouth. The extent of the disease being now more appreciable, provision may be made for the application of the saw and forceps. An incisor tooth, perhaps two, may be extracted, and then the mucous lining of the hard palate should be cut a little to that side of the mesial line on which the disease is situate, as far back as the soft palate, at; whose anterior margin a transverse division should be made between that just effected and the back of the last molar tooth ; then with one or other of the saws already referred to (p. 481) the alveoli and palatine plate of the superior maxilla should be notched,— almost divided,—from below upwards, when the cutting forceps should be used to complete the separation. But before the saw is laid aside, the operator should ascertain what may be required above ; for if the malar bone is sound, and also the orbital plate of the superior maxilla, they should both be left; and for this purpose a notch must be made across from the nasal process of the latter to the outer margin of the former, and then the forceps should be used, first to complete the division between the mouth and nose, next td cut through the nasal process of the superior maxilla, and then to pass along the horizontal groove already made with the saw, below the orbit. If, on the other hand, it is found impossible to save any portion of the os malm or of

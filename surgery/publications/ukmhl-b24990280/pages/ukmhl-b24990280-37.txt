19 CHAPTER III. MEANS AND INSTRUMENTS FOR SUPPRESSING HEMORRHAGE. The means and instruments for temporary suppression of bleeding from wounded arteries, (the most troublesome and also the most for- midable occurrence in all cutting operations on the living body,) are few and simple, in the hands of a good surgeon. In amputations of large portions of the extremities, a slight degree of pressure with the lingers or thumbs, will, if judiciously applied over the main artery, be sufficient. Fig. 20. On the upper extremity the circulation may be readily arrested with the lingers thus (fig. 20): if their points are properly placed over the artery, a very slight force suffices, and any part of the arm may be selected.

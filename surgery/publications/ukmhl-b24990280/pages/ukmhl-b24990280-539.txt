HERNIA. OPERATIONS. 521 intestine unreduced, after having cut the stricture, in consequence of sloughing, or a disposition towards it. If, unfortunately, the intestine is wounded during the operation, which occasionally happens, chiefly through the rashness and careless- ness of the operator, then there is no better course of procedure than leaving the aperture at the mouth of the sac, and retaining it there by means of a stitch through the bowel and the latter part—care being taken to keep the orifice in such a position that the contents of the gut will have free egress through the wound, without passing into the peritoneal cavity of the abdomen. Should the patient survive, and if there is an artificial anus, there will be plenty of time after- wards to consider what is best to be done, and whether Dupuytren’s mode of practice may be resorted to. It has not been my design in this work to dwell at great length on any individual operation ; and though I have been more parti- cular in describing that for hernia, with its difficulties and dangers, than with most others of which I have treated, the reader must not suppose that the subject has been exhausted ; on the contrary, I have confined my remarks to the leading characteristics of the disease and the operation, as they have presented themselves to me in a considerable series of cases, occurring both in my own practice and that of others. It is well known amongst practical surgeons, that in different instances of hernia, when the knife is required, appear- ances will present themselves which no former experience could have anticipated, and it is in such examples that the real difficulties are encountered: even allowing that these are productive of no embarrassment to the experienced surgeon, it must be admitted by all who have frequently performed this operation, that no language can sufficiently explain the different appearances which may from time to time be the cause of serious impediment. These remarks will be sufficiently appreciated by any one who has already had ex- perience in such proceedings, and I shall add nothing more on the present occasion regarding this subject, than merely refer to the difference in the description of the anatomy of the inguinal canal and of the operation : in the first, various textures have been spoken of under different names, whilst in the latter I have given a ge- neral direction to cut through every texture (without specifying each fascia) between the skin and the sac or its contents: the one style answers the purposes of the anatomist, the other, viz., that of considering all the textures or fasciae, as one layer, is, or ought to be, the view which the surgeon should take of the operation : this layer may be thick or thin, and may be divided with a few strokes of the knife, or require its repeated application, as has been clearly pointed out in the preceding pages. If a femoral protrusion be small and of recent date, the textures covering it will resemble the natural condition;—there will be a con- siderable quantity of fat and cellular tissue to divide ere the sac is exposed; mid, on the other hand, if it be large and of considerable

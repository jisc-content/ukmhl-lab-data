In other parts of the extremity it is an object of importance with the surgeon to form what is called, in common language, a good stump, and my own opi- nion is, that operations, such as I have described, are well calculated to do so in this situation. There may, however, be many instances in which it mijrht be advisable to leave the end of the metacarpal bone, and if it were sound this should be done. Not long ago I saw a baker, who had lost one of his fingers, and with whom, according to his own account, the breadth of the palm was of great consequence. In proof of my anxiety not to remove more than is positively re- quired, I must refer to the next cut (fig. 117), which exhibits the stump which I was enabled to make in an instance of gun-shot in- Fig. 117. jury of the hand, where even the two fingers which were ultimately pre- served were in an almost hopeless condition. 1 he bursting of a pistol caused extensive compound fracture and laceration in the thumb, fort, and middle fingers, and, in addition, the palm was most severely bat- tered.

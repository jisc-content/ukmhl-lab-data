522 THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. standing the skin and other tissues may all be found remarkably thin. In some instances of old date, when the tumour has never attained a great size, the sac is found a quarter or even half an inch in thickness; but in general it differs little in this respect from the usual condition of the peritoneum. Before resorting to the knife the taxis must be tried, and in applying pressure with the fingers backwards, and slightly upwards, too much attention cannot be paid to the position of the thigh, which should be bent upwards on the pelvis, whilst the patient is in a horizontal position, with the chest a little elevated on a pillow. The muscular parietes of the abdomen, as well as Poupartâ€™s ligament, are thoroughly relaxed in the above position, and if the fingers be judiciously applied, every fair chance is thus given to this method of procedure. It often happens, however, that the surgeon does not deem himself warranted in applying much pressure with his fin- gers ; indeed, in many instances, from previous experience, he can form a tolerably accurate idea as to the likelihood of his efforts being successful or otherwise as soon as he places his fingers on the protru- sion, and he proceeds at once to divide the stricture with the knife. A single incision about three inches in length, as exhibited by the dotted line in the accompanying drawing (fig. 225) will, in general, permit of all the requisite steps to be performed with facility. If the tumour be of considerable size it may be made longer; but in such a

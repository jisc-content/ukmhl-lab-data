DISSECTIONS. 249 clcs should then be taken off the anterior and lateral parts of the joint; the lateral ligaments should then be displayed ; the inner one will be easily disseeted, as will also be the long external one; the short fibrous structure a little behind the latter cannot on all occasions be clearly discerned, however, and at best the display of a second ex- ternal lateral ligament requires a very artificial dissection. The point of the knife, and then the finger, may be pushed across behind the ligament of the patella, and notice should be taken of the considerable quantity of fatty substance lying between the ligament and synovial membrane. The interior of the joint should now be exposed by divid- ing the tendon of the rectus, the crureus, and sub-crureus, about an inch above the patella : here, in all likelihood, a large bursa will be found between the sub-crureus and the femur, which may communi- cate with the synovial membrane; the knife should be carried down- wards through the capsule on each side as far as the lateral ligaments, when on throwing down the patella a large extent of the interior of the joint will be exposed, more particularly if it be put into a state of flexion. Whilst in this position, a portion of the synovial membrane, which will be seen attached to the femur in the hollow between the condyles, may be observed passing forwards and expanding on the inner surface of the fatty substance between it and the ligament of the patella, forming on each side of the mesial line a transverse margin, which projects in the space between the femur and tibia:â€”these are the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamenta alaria. By cutting these textures away, and bending the knee to its greatest extent, the ante- rior surface of the crucial ligaments may be exposed: if the dissector wishes to see them from behind, the posterior ligament of the joint must be removed, and in order to get a more complete view of them, the lateral should also be cut through, so as to leave the femur and tibia connected by the crucial ligaments only. The two bones may now be separated by dividing these textures, and after an examination of the semilunar cartilages, and the transverse band of fibres between their anterior extremities, (which is far from being regular in its ap*- pearance and size,) attention may next be devoted to the ankle. The various tendons which pass along the ankle-joint should now be more carefully examined than in the early stages of the dissection. Those passing in front, and the manner in which they are bound down by transverse fibres (anterior annular ligament) may be first noticed : the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, and those of the extensor communis and peroneus tertius, will be observed to pass in pretty close contact with each other, whilst that of the tibialis anticus runs in a distinct and separate sheath. On the inner and posterior side of the joint the tendons of the flexor longus pollicis, flexor com- munis, and tibialis posticus, will each be found in a separate groove, bound down by strong fibres: at first, however, the two latter tendons run in the same groove. On the outer side, the tendons of the pe- roneus longus and brevis will be found behind and below the malleolus extemus; and on the posterior part of the joint, but about an inch se-

PARACENTESIS ABDOMINIS. .50.0 cavity to permit the escape of fluid in ascites. The operation (para- centesis abdominis) may be done in the following manner: The patient should be seated on the margin of a chair, and the upper part of the abdomen should be encircled with a folded table-cloth or sheet, the middle of which should be laid over the stomach, and the two ends be- ing made to cross each other behind, should be given each to an assist- ant, who should be directed to pull them with moderate tightness, by which the tenseness of the parts below will be increased. The sur- geon then, resting on one knee, or seated on a low chair, should pass a trochar and canula through the linea alba about an inch and a half below the umbilicus, so as to penetrate the abdominal cavity: this being accomplished, he should withdraw the trochar, allow the fluid to pass through the canula into a bowl held in the hand, or a pail be- tween the patient’s feet, and when it has entirely escaped, he should close the wound with some adhesive strap, place a folded towel on the part, bring the sheet down upon it, and fasten the loose ends of the latter by pins, or with a needle and thread, after carrying them in front. It is usually considered that as the fluid escapes, and the pres- sure on the vena cava becomes less, there is a probability of the patient fainting, and hence the necessity of always keeping up pressure by gradually tightening the cloth encircling the body, and afterwards keeping it fastened for a time, until the parts become accustomed to their new condition. In passing the trochar in the above proceeding, some considerable force is required—a kind of plunge,—and it is well to guard against the point passing too deep, by keeping the forefinger within half an inch or so of it, as represented in the drawing (fig. 221).

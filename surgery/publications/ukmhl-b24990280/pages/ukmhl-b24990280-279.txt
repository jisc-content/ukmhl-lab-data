DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE. 2<il referred to ; and unless there be great swelling, the nature of either case must be easily detected, in consequence of the prominence of the bone ; nor is there much difficulty to be looked for in replacing it,â€” an operation which is accomplished chiefly by the thumbs, with which the surgeon forces the bone over the margin of the articular cartilage into its natural position. The necessary manipulations will be greatly facilitated by bending the body forwards, which will relax the rectus femoris muscle. It has been found in instances where these simple means have failed, that violent flexion of the knee has brought the patella down- wards from the external condyle on to the articular surface of the femur, when it has been immediately drawn into its natural position by the action of the quadriceps extensor. In a case of extreme ob- stinacy the ligamentum patella: has been divided, but the operation did not seem to favour the desired result; however, a good anatomist, in any similar example, might resort advantageously to some subcu- taneous section. Fig. 140. Fig. 141. The head of the tibia is occasionally driven off the condyles of the femur in a lateral direction, but seldom to any great extent, and when dislocation between these bones does occur, it is generally either back- wards or forwards. It is hardly possible to state which is the more severe injury, both being certainly of the most serious description ; perhaps that with the tibia forwards is the worst, as in addition to the

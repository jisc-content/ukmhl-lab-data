THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. 524 ing cut this part, I have not been able to push the bowel up, and have therefore passed the instrument a little deeper, and divided Gimber- nat’s ligament with the desired effect. It is undoubtedly easier to get at Poupart’s ligament in this operation than at Gimbernat’s; but the objection I have already stated to the division of this texture seems to me a good one ; the edges of the ligament will never come close again, and there must be a certain relaxation of the parts after- wards ; for however firm the cicatrix may be supposed to make them, it is certainly no unusual thing to see instances of protrusions occurring after the wound has completely closed. I do not conceive that there is any serious danger of injuring the spermatic cord in cutting Pou- part’s ligament, as the knife ought never to be carried so high. The slight additional difficulty of reaching Gimbernat’s ligament ought not to deter the operator from dividing it in preference to the mode last referred to, and the only objection to this proceeding that I can perceive is, the risk of dividing the obturator artery, should it happen to originate from the epigastric, and run down- wards to the obturator foramen along the inner side of the neck of the sac, parallel with the margin of the ligament. This risk has, I am inclined to think, been very much exaggerated, for al- though the irregularity is of common occurrence, as proved by the statistics of the dissecting-room, no average has been yet given of its presence simultaneously with hernia, nor would such a calculation be of any great practical value. In such a calculation it would be neces- sary to ascertain how often the artery runs on the inside of the neck of the sac, and how often on the outside ; for it is by no means to be supposed that when the irregularity is present, and a hernia occurs, it must of necessity pass in such a way as to leave the artery on the inner side of the neck of the sac so as to be endangered in the division of the margin of Gimbernat’s ligament. Even supposing that the vessel is present in this unusual position, I believe that this texture may be cut to the requisite extent without at the same time dividing the artery; and with this object the point of the bistoury should alone be passed beyond the margin of the ligament; indeed, there is no ad- vantage in passing the instrument deeper than is sufficient to allow its cutting edge to come in contact with the part to be divided, and if this be attended to, the obturator artery will in all probability escape, although it may even be in close contact with the neck of the sac and ligament of Gimbemat. At the worst, the accidental division of the vessel does not appear to be fatal in all instances, as one case, at- least (occurring in Dupuytren’s hands) proves, where the vessel was wound- ed, and the occurrence was not even suspected until the death of the patient three weeks afterwards, from disease in the bowels, when a clot of blood in the site of the wound led to the detection of the injury. After the operation for crural hernia the edges of the wound should be brought into contact by stitches, and a pad should be retained over the parts by a bandage, as in the case of the inguinal protrusion.

305 FRACTURES. him, the whole limb hangs in such a manner that the fragments are less likely to be disturbed than under ordinary circumstances. The best plan for effecting this object, which I have seen in use, is that followed by Mr. Luke, of the London Hospital, who suspends the part from the inside of the cradle which is usually placed over an injured limb to keep the bed clothes from it. An arch is made by three or four stout semicircular rods of iron, and the suspension is effected by means of two or three pieces of strong tape attached to these rods. Mr. Luke uses a kind of box, well supplied with cushions, in which he places the broken member ; the thigh is slightly bent on the pelvis, and the leg is kept in a horizontal position. A MTntyre’s splint, or one such as 1 have last recommended, may be used in the same way. In fractures of the lower extremity during the period when the patient requires to keep his bed, a space seldom less than five weeks, and often much more, and when it is of great consequence to keep the fragments still, the urinal and flat bed-pan are of essential service in effecting the latter object. Some surgeons have objected even to the use of the pan, however, and beds have been constructed with aper- tures in the ticking and frame-work below the pelvis, with the view of permitting the patient to evacuate the bowels without the necessity of raising the body at all. Earle’s bed is the most celebrated of this kind, but unless in Bartholomew’s Hospital, I am not aware that it is much in use among our hospital surgeons, who, with occasional exceptions, seem mostly to prefer a well-stuffed hair-mattress, and to trust the care of the patient to the attendants.

Fit/. 17 AND OPERATIONS. Fig. 16, 13 The gouge (fig. 17) is an instrument which, I imagine, has been in a great measure overlooked by the modern surgeon; but I cannot here omit giving it a full measure of praise. It was used by the Moreaus in the excisions of carious joints which they performed, and has been recommended by various authorities; yet I have seldom seen it in the surgeon’s hands. In operations for necrosis and caries I deem it quite indispensable, more particularly for the latter ; and the amount of good which 1 have seen accrue from its use in my own practice, leads me to give it the strongest approbation as a most useful surgical instrument. Cases will be referred to in after parts of this work, when its efficacy in operations for caries of the tarsal bones, of the shaft of the tibia, and of the articular surfaces of several of the large; bones, will be fully exemplified. The instrument which I generally use is about four or five inches long, including handle and blade, about half an inch broad, and sharpened at the point like a turner’s gouge. Both handle and blade are short, to enable me to rest my hand on the surface near where the instrument is applied, and thus prevent any sudden plunge, such as might happen were it of greater length. The round handle is kept-in the palm, whilst the point of the fore- finger directs the scooping movements. As a preliminary step to dissection, the arteries should be filled with a coarse injection of tallow and vermilion, to which has been added a small proportion of carbonate of magnesia. This composition runs sufficiently minute to fill all the vessels of much surgical iruport-

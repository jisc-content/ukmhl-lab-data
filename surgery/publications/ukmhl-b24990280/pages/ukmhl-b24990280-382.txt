THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 364 through the skin on the opposite side, about two or three inches from the anus ; next, he should carry it downwards and forwards, so as to cut a flap from the anterior aspect of the thigh, about four inches in length. When the blade is entered, the limb should be held up, and even slightly bent at the joint; the instrument will then pass along more readily than if all the textures were thrown on the stretch, and, moreover, there is greater certainty of passing it behind the main vessels, and even dividing some of the fibres, if not the whole, of the iliacus internus and psoas muscles. As the knife is carried down- wards, the assistant, who stands behind the operator, should slip his fingers into the wound and carry them sufficiently far across to enable him to grasp the femoral artery between them and the thumb : this he may do from the inside or outside at will, and with the right or left hand as may be most convenient, the same grasp enabling him to raise the flap as soon as it is completed. The right hand is represented in the drawing (fig. 194), which exhibits part of the operation on the left Fij. 194. hip, but some might prefer the other hand, although I should myself put more reliance in the grasp of the right. The flap being raised, as here exhibited, the point of the knife should then be struck against the head of the bone, so as to divide the anterior part of the capsular ligament and any textures in this situation which may not have been included in the flap. To facilitate this part of the operation, the knee should be forcibly depressed by the assistant who holds it; the head of the bone will thus be caused to start from its socket, and if the round ligament is not ruptured by the force, a slight touch with the edge of the knife will cause it to give way. At this period, depression

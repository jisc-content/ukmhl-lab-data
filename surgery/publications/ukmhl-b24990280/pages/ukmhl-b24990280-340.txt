322 THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. A strap or a little simple dressing should be applied, and, to ensure perfect quietude for the next six or eight days, the limb should be kept steady with a splint. I have met with a variety of instances where it has not been advisable to resort to this practice; I have, however, in four cases, cut into the knee-joint in the way described, and with per- fect success ; and in these examples the absence of dangerous in- flammation may be attributed to the great care which was taken of each patient, both immediately before and after the operation: all the cartilages in these cases have been small,â€”not bigger than a garden bean ; but I have seen much larger extracted with equal success, though I have known alarming inflammation follow such operations. To obviate the dangers of a large external wound, a method has lately been proposed by Dr. Goyrand, as also by Mr. Syme, to re- move these bodies from the knee, by means of a subcutaneous in- cision. The object being fixed as above described, a narrow knife is passed under the skin, and a wound is made in the capsule, of sufficient size to allow it to be squeezed out of the joint into the subcutaneous cellular texture; time is then given for the wound in the synovial membrane to heal, and the cartilage may afterwards be per- mitted to remain in its new position, or removed through an incision of proper size in the skin, according to circumstances. Instances have been known where bullets, necrosed portions of bone, and other foreign substances have been extracted from this lo- cality ; but such proceedings are very different in character from those above alluded to, as before any thing of the kind has been attempted, the joint has been in a manner destroyed by inflammation and its consequences, and therefore they more resemble excisions of diseased portions of bone, than operations on a joint whose articular surfaces may be considered in a state of health, as is the case in the instance of loose cartilage.

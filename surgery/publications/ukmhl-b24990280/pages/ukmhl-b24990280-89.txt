HECTIC. 71 Effusions in the serous and synovial surfaces frequently require sur- gical treatment, as hydrocele, ascites, hydrothorax, or in certain affec- tions of bursae and articular surfaces. Sometimes these effusions con- sist of an excess of the natural secretion ; at other times, the fluid seems a mixture of serum and lymph, or pus with serum or synovia, and it rarely happens that pure pus is found in any of these cavities, although every good pathologist may occasionally have seen cases of the kind. In dissections of those who have died of acute pe- ritonitis, pure pus is sometimes found as if it had been secreted from the serous surface : in the pleura, too, a similar occurrence may occa- sionally be noticed; but in general, when there is pure pus, its secre- tion seems to have been preceded by the exudation of lymph, forming a new lining surface to the original serous membrane, in most respects analogous to that which forms the interior of ordinary abscesses. The treatment of many of these affections will be particularly con- sidered afterwards. Here, however, I may state, that it is usually conducted according to the methods above described for inflammation and abscess. At first, if the effusion seem the result of acute action, the violence of the disease must be allayed by such local and constitu- tional remedies as have already been described, and by such specifics as may be known,â€”as, for example, cathartics and diuretics in as- cites, or colchicum in what are usually called rheumatic effusions into joints; then, as the action becomes chronic, such plans as maybe supposed to excite absorption may next be used, and should these fail, the propriety of giving vent to the fluid may be taken into consiv deration. On the latter point there need be little hesitation on some occasions, as in the case of hydrocele, whilst in others, as in hydro- thorax, the circumstances of the case should be well weighed, ere the surgeon proceeds to open such a large serous surface. Long-continued and profuse suppuration is almost certain to end in hectic, and if the surgeon cannot arrest the secretion by removing its cause, changing the action, closing the abscess or sinus, or amputating the diseased part, then he can only trust to those means which a knowledge of practical medicine, or common prudence, may suggest.

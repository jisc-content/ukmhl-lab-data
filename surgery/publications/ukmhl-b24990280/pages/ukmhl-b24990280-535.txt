517 HERNIA. OPERATIONS. in doing so, even though the original sac may have been completely obliterated by the long-continued pressure. If, then, it is found impossible to reduce the contents of the sac by the taxis, the use of the knife becomes absolutely requisite, and it is my opinion that, in the majority of cases, the sooner it is resorted to, when once the surgeon is satisfied that he cannot relieve the patient in any other way, so much the greater chance is there of success attend- ing the operation. The instruments for this proceeding are, a scalpel, a director, and a curved probe-pointed bistoury, with other apparatus and assistants such as are usually required for capital operations. Whatever be the size of the hernia, a wound through the skin of three or four inches in length will, in general, permit of the due per- formance of the future steps; if the tumour be small a shorter incision than this will scarcely suffice, and if large, a longer one will not facili- tate the movements of the surgeon much, whilst it may increase the patient's danger considerably by the exposure of additional extent of textures. It may, however, be requisite to increase the length of the external opening in particular cases. The patient being on his back, with the knees (more especially that on the affected side) and shoulders slightly elevated, the surgeon, standing between the legs or on whichever side is most convenient, makes an incision through the skin over the neck and body of the tumour, its upper extremity being nearly midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the tuberosity of the pubes, about one inch and a half above the level of Poupartâ€™s ligament, and its lower about the middle Fig. 223. part of the scrotum, as indicated in the accompanying drawing (fig. 223); "the cellular membrane should next be divided in the same

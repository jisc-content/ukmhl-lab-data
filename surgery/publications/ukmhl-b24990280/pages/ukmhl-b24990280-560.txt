542 THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. Supposing little or no inflammation present, and that the parts are as represented in the last cut (fig. 228), which was sketched from a patient of mine, on whom I was about to enlarge the orifice, and at the same time remove an indolent ulcer—an excoriation on the margin—the fol- lowing proceeding will effectually put matters right:—The extremity of the foreskin should be seized between the forefinger and thumb of the left hand, and half an inch of it removed with a single stroke of a sharp bistoury—care being taken not to injure the point of the glans : the skin will now retract suddenly over half the latter part, a large wound will appear; but as yet the surface of the glans will be as completely covered as ever : now, the blunt-pointed blade of the surgical scissors (p. 30) should be inserted between the glans and what covers it, which is in fact the lining membrane of the prepuce, and a slit should be made half an inch, or a little more, directly upwards, and in the mesial line, when the membrane will curl over in a manner, and follow the course of the skin, whereby the glans will be completely exposed : next the skin and mucous membrane should be tacked toge- ther by a few stitches of interrupted suture,—no heed being taken of the sharp comers of the mucous tissues, excepting to keep them as far from each other as possible: the narrow circular line of wound will close by the first intention; and thus in the course of six or eight days the parts will be as if no operation had ever been performed, or rather, as if they had been naturally well formed at first. A proceeding such as this may be so conducted as to effect a partial removal of the foreskin, and still leave sufficient behind to bear a re- semblance to one originally well formed, or a complete circumcision may be effected. Perhaps the latter course should in general be re- sorted to, as when inflammation occurs in the prepuce—as it must after these wounds—a troublesome swelling is apt to continue in the remaining part for a long time afterwards. The above proceeding may be modified in various ways; with the exception of the stitches, it resembles, I believe, the Jewish rite. In the infant the stitches are of no consequence, but in the adult I deem them an essential appendage of good surgery. Erections are of frequent occurrence during the nights immediately succeeding such an operation, and if the two membranes of the pre- puce are not thus held together, a large open granulating surface will be established, which will be slow in healing, and may, moreover, by its contractions in a circular direction, cause, for a long period after- wards, a degree of inconvenient tightness on the end of the corpus cavernosum. Usually, when I mean to perform complete circumcision I pass a director between the front of the glans and the foreskin as high as possible, then run a narrow, straight, sharp-pointed bistoury upon the groove, transfix the root of the prepuce by cutting towards myself, and next by carrying the blade in a circular direction, right and left, separate the part. In certain cases the prepuce is of a natural length and appearance in every respect, saving that the orifice is painfully tight and liable to

231 AMPUTATION AT THE LEFT SHOULDER. supra-spirmtus, capsule, and long heads of the biceps and triceps ; and to facilitate these steps, the elbow should now be carried in front of the chest, and the head of the bone pushed backwards. When the textures are sufficiently divided, the same movement will cause the luxation of the articular surface: the knife should then be passed in front of the bone, and carried downwards and forwards to form a flap about the same length as the other, by dividing the subscapular muscle, the re- maining portions of the capsule and of the deltoid, short head of the biceps, pectoralis major, vessels, nerves, and skin of the axilla and forepart of the shoulder. In the last movements of the knife, the axillary artery must be divided; and to restrain hemorrhage an assist- ant, at this period of the operation, should grasp the soft parts in the axilla. As soon as the arm is detached, a ligature should be placed on the main vessel, the subscapular, and any other artery which may continue to bleed. The edges of the wound should then bo brought in contact, and the line of union will be nearly perpendicular, the flaps being posterior and anterior. I his drawing (fig. 128) will serve to make my description clear. The knife (which, in my opinion, the artist has represented a little too long) is seen transfixing the shoulder, and the dotted line shows the size of the posterior flap, which, in such a case as this, where the deltoid appears so well developed, may be made of any reasonable size and length which the surgeon may choose. This operation is nearly similar to the mode proposed by Lisfranc, and may be varied in different ways. The point of the knife need not be entered so low: in which case, it may be pushed further forwards,

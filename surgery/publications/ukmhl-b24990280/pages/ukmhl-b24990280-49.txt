Their length should be between four and five inches, and the curve near the hinge will be found of advantage on many occasions. When bleeding has been arrested from a wound, its edges are generally brought in contact, in hopes that they will speedily unite. Various means are resorted to for keeping the cut surfaces in apposi- tion, which characterise the different kinds of sutures. A combina- tion of stitching and bandaging is applied, in almost all instances, where a wound is of such magnitude that its edges gape. The interrupted suture (fig. 34) is in most frequent use. It is formed by passing a needle and thread, such as are represented on a preceding page (fig. 31), through the skin and subcutaneous cellular tex- ture from without inwards on the one side, and from within outwards on the other, at about the fourth of an inch distant from each margin, and fastening the end of the thread with sufficient tightness to pre- vent the surfaces from separating. The stitches are proportioned in number to the extent of the wound ; they are commonly placed about an inch from each other: where the distance is greater, the parts may be supported by a few straps of adhesive plaster, placed between each stitch, thus (fig. 35) ; and, over all, it is usual to ap- CIIAPTER IV.

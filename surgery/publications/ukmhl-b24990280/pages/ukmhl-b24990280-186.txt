THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 168 viously been tried and recommended. The surgeon will best display his judgment, not by obstinately refusing to resort to any plan but that which he may think best, but by attempting, after his first f effort lias failed, any other which will give his patient a reasonable chance of relief: if he fail with one, he may succeed with another; if gentle force will not suffice, he must apply a greater amount; if a steady extension will not answer, he must try the lever and fulcrum ; and, should one attitude for the arm not do, he may place it in an- other; he may move it gently from side to side, upwards and down- wards, or twist and twine it rudely in all directions to attain the wished-for result; and should he succeed, as in all likelihood he may, he ought not on that account to imagine, that the successful plan in this instance, and that only, is the best for all future cases. It will be remarked, that I have drawn no broad distinctions be- tween the methods to be pursued in one dislocation and another. The means above recommended, 1 have seen successfully used, what- ever might be the position of the bone; and the references which have been made to others now deemed obsolete, as well as the occa- sional necessity of varying the plans and the attitude of the limb, null be sufficient to show, that the surgeon must often trust more to his own skill and mechanical ingenuity, than to any minute rules which might be given here, but which are purposely omitted, as not being in accordance with the arrangements for this work. It may often be a question, whether or not, in dislocations of old standing, the surgeon should persist in, or even attempt, the applica- tion of violent force to effect reduction. I have seen a most excellent practitioner fail at the shoulder, after the lapse of three weeks, when another, making the attempt a few days afterwards, succeeded. I have myself been successful in the eleventh week; and, though cases have been put to rights even after the third month, the propriety of inter- fering with the generality of such instances may admit of doubt. Frequent experience on the living subject, and that acquired in the dissecting-room, have sufficiently demonstrated the fact, that even when the head of a bone is left in its abnormal position, the limb be- low will gradually acquire an amazing latitude of movement, and a new joint will be formed, which, in many respects, will almost equal in efficiency the natural articulation before the injury. I have seen individuals with old unreduced dislocations of the shoulder move the elbow backwards and forwards, and also raise the hand to the head with the utmost facility; and every one experienced in the dissecting- room and in museums must be familiar with the admirable manner in which nature adjusts the newly opposed surfaces to each other. These observations are peculiarly applicable to the shoulder and hip- joints, but they should be kept in view in other regions also : I can- not imagine that they will engender carelessness either in the exami- nation of any joint supposed to be the seat of displacement, or in the application of remedial measures, and I shall only, therefore, add the views entertained on the above important question by one of the

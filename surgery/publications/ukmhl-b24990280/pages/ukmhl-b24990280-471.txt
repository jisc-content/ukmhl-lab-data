OPERATIONS ON THE NOSE AND NOSTRILS. 453 • < ' • \ until there seems good assurance that the ulcerative process has terminated. In some instances the apex and alae of the nose seem so entire, al- though sunken to a level with the cheeks, that the propriety of thus covering them may be doubted. Instead of doing so, Dieffenbach has elevated the parts again, by slitting them into three longitudinal por- tions,—the outermost incisions being carried in the course of the lines on the cheeks in figure 205,—then he has pared the edges of the slips so as to make each narrower within than without, like the stones of an arch ; next he has dissected the cheeks from the nasal margin of each superior maxilla, fitted the wounds closely by interrupted sutures, and then kept the whole prominently forward with a couple of long silver needles passed from one cheek to the other: but this latter pro- ceding will be best understood by a reference to the next figures. A patient of mine (a young gentleman who had been somewhat vain of his personal appearance previously, and not without good reason,) was left after severe ulceration of the interior of the nose, in the condition represented in fig. 206, the columna and the cartilaginous septum had Fig. 206.

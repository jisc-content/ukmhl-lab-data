ABSCESS. 65â€™ the point of the bistoury is supposed to have reached this fluid, the blade may then be gently turned a little on its long axis, when, pro- bably, the pus will spring up along its surface, or a director, as re- ferred to at p. 18, may be pushed down through the wound, the blade remaining and serving as a guide. In opening an abscess, whatever be the instrument used, I invariably prefer puncturing first, and then cutting from within outwards, to the method pursued by some, of making a sort of dissection, by successive incisions through the skin and other textures. When an abscess is freely opened, as above recommended, the whole surface is exposed to the air, and to the contact of such dress- ings as may be deemed advisable. Within a few days the whole cavity is covered with red granulations; and these, with the contrac- tion of the sac subsequent to the evacuation, serve to diminish the space, until ultimately, as cicatrization is completed, the part is nearly, if not entirely, on a level with those around. After the open- ing is made I generally apply slight pressure to squeeze out most of the matter, then push in with the point of a probe a long narrow strip of lint, which I allow to remain for a couple of days, until sup- puration is established on the cut surfaces; in the interval I apply a poultice, or the warm-water dressing, as recommended at p. 54, and continue with one or other of these until the granulations seem to fill up the whole space to a level with the surrounding surface: then I make use of simple ointment, thinly spread on lint, and from time to time wash the sore with a solution of sulphate of zinc or of copper (gr. ii. ad *i.), until it is healed over. Some little variety may be required occasionally, as will be more fully explained in my observ- ations on the treatment of granulations. F

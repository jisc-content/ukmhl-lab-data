LITHOTOMY. 577 calls the proceeding) I need not refer more particularly at present to such a practice. Among the numerous authors on the subject of lithotomy, there is difficulty in selecting those most worthy of notice in such a work as this; and it is not deemed necessary to advert in any particular man- ner to the modifications which have been or are practised with regard to different steps in the proceedings. Of the method with the cutting gorget I have had little experience; and although I have seen the operation admirably executed with this instrument by Mr. Green at St. Thomas’s Hospital, I cannot but express my concurrence with the prevailing feeling of the present day, that the scalpel or bistoury is the safest instrument for making the wound in the neck of the bladder. There is no modem author with whose works I am acquainted, who has so clearly pointed out the deplorable effects of the gorget, as Mr. Crosse, and in so far as I am myself able to form an opinion, the in- strument might be altogether dispensed with among modem surgeons. Through the polite attention of Mr. Key, I have had an opportunity of witnessing with what ease and dexterity he performs the operation on a straight staff in a way peculiar to himself, and of which he has published an account; but partly from custom, and partly because I think that in the present state of our knowledge of the means of ex- tracting a stone from the bladder by lithotomy the proceeding of Cheselden cannot be excelled, whether as regards facility of exe- cution or safety to the patient, I give his method the preference. The highest averages of success (one death in five, in six, seven, and in eight) have been attained in this way, by Cheselden himself, and by many who have imitated his movements, among whom I may enumerate as perhaps the most successful, Mr. Martineau of Norwich, Mr. Chrichton of Dundee, and Mr. Liston, whose operations I often witnessed in former years with admiration. •J n

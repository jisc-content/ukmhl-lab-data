THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. To the beginner this proceeding will be the simplest; but to any one who has confidence in the use of the knife, I recommend the following method: The heel of the instrument should be laid on the side of the leg furthest from the surgeon, and the blade should then be drawn across the front, cutting the semilunar flap of skin, until its point comes opposite to where the edge was first laid on ; without raising the in- strument transfixion should next be made behind the bones, and the rest of the proceedings conducted as in the other instance. The ope- ration when done in this manner will look somewhat more elegant, (if the term be applicable to any such proceeding,) but can scarcely be said to possess any other advantage. The drawings (figs. 188 and 189) will further elucidate these de- scriptions: the one (188) exhibiting the first position of the knife, and the outlines for the two flaps ; the other the attitude after trans- fixion, and as the blade is being carried downwards : both operations were done on the subject according to the method last referred to; and, in the lower part of the leg (fig. 189), as soon as the knife was thrust across behind the bones, the artist cried tc stop,” and pencilled the design as it is represented. I may here call attention to the acute angle at the junction between the two flaps: the incision is seemingly further back than there is any occasion for, and this will be most likely to strike those who may have witnessed only the method by transfixion first, and the transverse incision afterwards. By the latter proceeding the anterior and posterior do not correspond very accu- rately in their respective lengths, and so when the stitches are in- serted there is always a puckered irregularity at each angle,—the wound in the skin of the posterior flap being doubled on itself, as it were, whereas by carrying the incision backwards on each side of the

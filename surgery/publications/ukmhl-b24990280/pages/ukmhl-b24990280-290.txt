THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 272 notch into which it is desired to put it, can be fastened in an instant by slipping a little iron wedge between it and the smooth side of the pillar opposite to the notches. Each pillar is about an inch and three- fourths in diameter; it is fastened to the floor below and a strong rail above, and can withstand any reasonable degree of force; and as it occasionally happens during the reduction of a dislocation, that it is necessary to move the ends of the apparatus upwards or the reverse, the movements can be much more readily accomplished with this mechanism than by undoing one or more knots, as would be required, if a rope or towel were made use of. The apparatus for extension and counter-extension being adjusted, the surgeon, having desired his assistant to commence, places himself at the patient’s pelvis, and, by frequent examination with his eyes and hands, ascertains the progress of the attempt. As the assistant continues to pull, the trochanter major, or perhaps the head of the bone, can lie perceived gliding gradually downwards, and the descent will be greatly facilitated by moving the thigh in a rotatory manner on its long axis, which can be readily accomplished by laying hold of the leg at the ankle, and carrying the foot upwards and downwards. In most examples that have come under my notice, I have observed that the extending force alone has been sufficient; but in some I have seen advantages derived from passing a long towel under the upper part of the thigh, with which the surgeon has endeavoured to raise the head of the femur over the margin of the cotyloid cavity, by pull- ing in a transverse direction to the force already in use, at the same time placing his foot on the pelvis by way of counter-extension. I believe that this method, in some instances, facilitates reduction ; but feel satisfied that continued extension at the same time is necessary, and I have less faith in sudden and eccentric movements producing benefit in this dislocation than in most others. The sudden snap, jerk, or shock which, when the reduction is accomplished, usually is observed by both patient and surgeon, sufficiently indicates the suc- cess of the effort, and if, when the apparatus is slackened, the move- ments at the joint can be easily effected,— the distortion has disap- peared,—and the opposite sides are symmetrical, there need be no further doubt; the patient should then be carried to bed, and kept quiet for several weeks, until the parts have adhered and regained some considerable strength. In some instances, where the displacement has existed several weeks, I have known it necessary to repeat the attempt at reduction, the first having completely failed ; and though I have frequently seen them to be equally useless, I have in some observed the most happy results. A surgeon, therefore, when he can reasonably hope to benefit his patient, should not at once give up a case as beyond his power merely because he fails in the first trial: circumstances may be more favourable on a second attempt a few days afterwards; indeed, I may say a few minutes in some cases, as I have known an effort suc- ceed, with the hands alone, within the lapse of a short space of time

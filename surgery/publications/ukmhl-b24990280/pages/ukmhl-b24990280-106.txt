88 ERYSIPELAS. the use of flour or chalk, or smearing the part with mercurial oint- ment ; the two former are said to have a cooling effect, and moreover they absorb the moisture, which is exuded in the form of cuticular bulla: or vesicles, in many cases of erysipelas ; and the latter, with most equivocal merits, has the disadvantage of being a most filthy mode of treatment. I imagine that the heating influence of flour may probably he greater than the cooling, and I can see little benefit in the absorbing effect of this material, of chalk, or of any other similar re- medy. When fluid is actually present, and when such means are used, a dirty cake is generally formed on the surface, which, if not soon removed, often proves a source of irritation ; the secretion forming a vesicle becomes semi-purulent, and thus the supposed remedy be- comes an evil. In slight excoriations of surface, slight inflammations from certain apparent sources of irritation, such as may be noticed in very fat children, or even grown-up parties, or from urine coming constantly in contact with the skin during any period of life, I have no particular objection to such remedies, although 1 believe that in all such cases attention to cleanliness, and a proper change of dressings, may be equally conducive to good; but in erysipelas they are often, I imagine, worse than useless. In erythema, which term implies the mildest form of this disease, I believe all that need, in general, be done locally is to apply warm fomentations, which, with the ordinary treatment for other simple kinds of inflammation, will keep the surface comfortable, until, in the course of a few days, the affection subsides. It may happen, however, that the disease may assume a more severe character, or may actually be so from the commencement, but even then I would recommend the above local treatment, and, in addition, such a number of leeches to be applied, as the extent of the disease might seem to demand, or the age of the patient, and his condition generally, might appear to warrant. In instances requiring leeches, I should consider the dis- ease as simple erysipelas,â€”that is, a more severe form of inflamma- tion in the skin; and in some such examples, if the swelling were considerable, as it occasionally is on the head and neck, I should deem punctures with a lancet of advantage in permitting the escape of both blood and serum. In the most severe forms of the disease, when from the pain and other symptoms of acute inflammation there was every reason to ap- prehend the fonnation of matter, I should first, perhaps, endeavour to mitigate the violence of the action, by the use of a greater number of leeches ; and in the event of not succeeding in this way, I should not hesitate to make one or more incisions, according to the extent of the disease, through the skin, so as to give free vent to blood and serum, and also to matter, should it happen to have already formed. Pos- sibly, however, the suppurative action may not have occurred, but notwithstanding, the wounds will be productive of great benefit; and should the secretion of pus ensue, the fluid will have ready egress through one or other of the openings.

LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. 307 should be made over the most convex part of the foot, commencing a little in front of the ankle and extending as far as the space between the metatarsal bones of the great and second toes : after the skin is divided, the strong aponeurosis immediately underneath must be cut nearly to the same extent; the tendons of the extensor pollicis and extensor longus communis muscles will now be exposed, and the vessel will be found lying between them in close contact with the bones, ac- companied by a vein on each side: a slight scratch with the point of the needle will allow them to be put aside; then the ligature being carried round the artery and fastened, and the edges of the wound approximated by one or two stitches, the operation is completed. Occasionally, in this situation the vessel will not be found exactly in the space between the tendons above-named : it may take a slight turn under the common extensors ere its dips between the metatarsal bones, and it should always be remembered that it may possibly be wanting altogether. In the dead subject such an operation as that described is very easily accomplished; but in the living body, unless the parts are free from swelling, whether from inflammation or infiltration of blood, the same facility should not be expected. The vessel may be secured above the instep, by making an incision three inches in length, and searching still between the tendons already named : if, however, the incisions be made more than a hand-breadth above the ankle, the artery must be looked for between the extensor communis and tibialis antieus ; low down it lies on the surface of the tibia,â€”higher up, on the interosseal membrane. In the upper third of the leg, the vessel lies deep between the two last-named muscles, and a free incision of the surface will be required to get to the bottom of the space between them : the aponeurosis of the leg offers a greater obstacle to exposure of this deep space than the integuments; it must, therefore, be divided to an equal extent, and in addition a little transverse notch in it on each side of the wound will greatly facilitate the proceedings. Throughout its course in the leg the vessel is accompanied by two veins; but here, as in the foot, the anterior tibial nerve is so far separated from it, as not to be much in the way; and, indeed, its division with the knife would be of no great consequence. The following sketch (fig. 1G8) exhibits the lines of incision: on the lower part of the leg the wound should be about three-fourths of an inch on the fibular side of the crest of the tibia ; higher up, particularly if the subject be muscular, it should be an inch and a quarter at least from the same part, to make allowance for the breadth of the anterior surface of the tibialis antieus; and in each proceeding, especially that high up, the surgeon should not make his way between the muscles directly backwards, but should follow the line of separation between them, which leads towards the centre of the limb. In attempting these operations it should be remembered that the artery is occasionally irregular; it may be very small, or it may be

INSTRUMENTS, DISSECTIONS, 1G of the thigh, only then discovers that he is on the wrong side of the patient, and, in order to complete the operation, has to walk round to the place where he should have been at the commencement. I have also seen an occurrence of this kind, and, as a teacher, I must say, that although such untoward events may not be of much conse- quence to the patient, assuredly they reflect little credit on the sur- geon, or on the art which he professes. On the dead subject it is not necessary to provide all that may be required on the living; but, for the sake of illustration, I shall sup- pose a case occurring in practice, in which event, then, to make sure that all the requisite apparatus for an operation is provided, the best plan is to lay everything in order on a small table or tray, which can be placed near the surgeon; as, for example, in a capital amputa- tion, they may be placed thus : the knife, to cut the soft parts ; saw to divide the bones ; cutting forceps to remove spicuke of bone ; forceps and tenaculum to lay hold of the arteries requiring to be tied ; liga- tures to apply to these vessels ; needles with thread to stitch the wound ; straps of adhesive plaster, lint, and bandages, to dress it; sponges with water, cold and hot, to wipe away the blood; and such other apparatus as, from the circumstances of the case, the surgeon may deem requisite: moreover, no capital operation should ever be commenced without some cordial being ready, in case the patient should grow faint. Wine is generally provided on such occasions ; but it may be well in some instances to have stronger stimulants at hand, as brandy, whiskey, or carbonate of ammonia. The quantity of wine which a patient will take during the performance of a severe and pro- tracted operation is often remarkable; and this should be kept in view when a formidable operation is contemplated. Some time ago, in performing amputation in the thigh, an accident occurred with the tourniquet, and the patient, already much exhausted by disease, grew faint from the sudden loss of blood, as well as from the shock of the operation : his pulse was gone at the wrists, and scarcely to be felt in the arms ; his face was pale, cold, and clammy, and his eyes had the glassy stare of speedy dissolution ; yet he was roused from this alarming state by the rapid exhibition of wine, having in the course of a few minutes swallowed fourteen ounces of that fluid. Besides these arrangements, some previous understanding ought to exist between the surgeon and assistants, who must, of necessity, be present at a capital operation. One must be placed to compress the main artery, if a tourniquet is not used ; another, supposing the operation is an amputation, to retract the flaps; a third to hand the instruments or take them from the surgeon ; a fourth to take charge of the sponges and warm water; there may be others to assist in secur- ing the patient during his struggles, and of course if a large portion of a limb is to be removed, an assistant must be instructed to keep it steady during the operation, and to lay it aside as soon as it is sepa- rated. When the surgeon has it in his power to provide a sufficient number of assistants, he ought always to do so; occasionally, how-

Figure 166 is from a cast where the tibia and fibula were broken ; I had it taken with the object of showing the kind of displacement which occurs in some of these cases. The other drawing (fig. 167) Fiy. 166. Fia. 167. exhibits the same limb two months afterwards. It is intended to show that, with care, the projection of the upper fragment may be entirely avoided, and also is a good example of what may be done with the above splint, which was used on this occasion. In concluding my observations on fractures of the leg, I cannot omit again referring to the method of swinging the part, after it has been properly put up with splints and bandages, although it has al- ready been adverted to in the introductory chapter on fractures. The chief advantage of the proceeding seems to be, that, when the pa- tient moves his body in any way, as when the bed-pan is placed undei

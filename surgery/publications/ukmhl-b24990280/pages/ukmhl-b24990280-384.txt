THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 366 were pushed in front of that muscle, and so what he strives for on one side is lost on the other. Next to having command of the vessels, the management of the thigh may he deemed the most important part of the assistantsâ€™ duties. If he to whom this task is allotted does not depress forcibly, and then raise the head of the bone, as has been directed, the disarticulation can never be easily or rapidly accomplished : besides, to do his work well, he should be careful when the surgeon is forming the posterior flap, not to abduct the thigh or allow it to be turned forward on its own axis, as the knife is thus apt to get between the head of the bone and the trochanter, so that its progress is completely arrested by this pro- cess. I have frequently seen this occur on the subject, and the artist has been careful in showing the limb in a proper position to obviate this difficulty. It is evident, however, that these manoeuvres with the femur cannot be practised on all occasions, as for example in gun-shot fracture of the neck of the bone, and the operator must therefore do the best he can, under the circumstances, in disarticulating. In such a case the knife, after the formation of the first flap, might perhaps be insinuated between the fragments, although probably this plan would not succeed, as I have, in fractures in other parts requiring amputation, known its progress arrested or impeded by a small fragment or splinter: if then, the circumstances did not seem favourable for such a pro- ceeding, the head of the bone might be dissected out, and the blade then placed behind it; but I should feel most inclined under the circumstances to make the posterior flap immediately after the first is formed, by transfixing a second time, as in the amputation of the thigh with anterior and posterior flaps, and then apply the saw above the seat of fracture, if that were possible; if this could not be done I would use it at any other convenient part, and the limb being removed, and the vessels secured, would then with a scalpel or bistoury remove the remainder of the bone. It is possible that in such a case (indeed I have seen it on the living body) the femur might separate at the seat of fracture after division of the soft parts, and in such an event the end of the upper fragment would require to be smoothed, or perhaps its entire removal might be necessary. In certain cases of disease or injury in the upper portion of the bone the surgeon may find it impossible to determine the condition of its neck and head, and perhaps in such examples it would be best to am- putate through the trochanters ; and then, should it be necessary, re- move the head of the bone. I have often amputated at the hip-joint on the dead subject in this manner, and have found it a simple pro- ceeding to cut out the head : as soon as the limb is separated, the end of the upper portion should be seized with the left hand, and turned in the requisite directions to expedite the application of the knife to the capsular ligament, and when a sufficient opening is made in this part, in front, or towards the inside, a slight twist will cause the disarticulation.

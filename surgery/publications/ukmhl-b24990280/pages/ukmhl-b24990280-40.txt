MEANS AND INSTRUMENTS â€™22 arm-pit and elbow may, according to circumstances, answer equally well. Fig. 23. On the lower limb, the place usually selected for the application of this instrument is the upper third of the thigh, as represented in sketch 24. If amputation in the thigh is to be performed, it should be placed as high as possible; and it should always be remem- bered that its presence impedes the retraction of the soft parts. In amputations of the leg or foot, some place it on the lower third of the thigh, a large pad, proportioned to the depth of the popliteal space, being used on the occasion, and I give a decided preference to this situation in such operations. If the instrument is properly applied at the knee, in the position represented in figure 25, amputation may be performed anywhere between the knee and ankle, without the loss of a single ounce of blood; and so far from the pressure .being less effective in this situ- ation than elsewhere, I deem it the most eligible of all the extent of the lower extremity, when the operation is to be done below the knee.

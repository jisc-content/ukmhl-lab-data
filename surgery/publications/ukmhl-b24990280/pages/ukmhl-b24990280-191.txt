173 DISLOCATIONS OF TIIE CLAVICLE. Fig. 79. per place with great ease ; but, when left alone, it immediately slip- ped out again. Nothing was done, a new joint formed, and the child afterwards possessed as much power in the one arm as in the other. Sir Astley Cooper refers to a case of displacement of this part of the bone backwards, which occurred to Mr. Davie, of Bungay, in Suf- folk, wherein that gentleman successfully removed about an inch of its extremity to relieve the patient of dysphagia, occasioned by pres- sure upon the oesophagus. The displacement had occurred gradually in consequence of great spinal deformity; and Sir Astley states, that he had never seen an instance of the luxation resulting from violence, although he admits its possibility. Several cases of this dislocation, occasioned by violence, have been observed since Sir Astley Cooperâ€™s work was first published; and I may refer the reader to the London and Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science, for October 1841, for some interesting notices of examples of the kind. Displacement of the upper margin of the latissimus dorsi muscle, beneath the lower angle of the scapula, has been referred to occa- sionally. 1 have not seen an instance of the kind on the living body. It is quite possible, however, judging from appearances on dissection, that such an occurrence may happen; but 1 should suppose that a slight movement of the arm and scapula would put all right again.

•253 DISLOCATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. the skin only ; it may, however, extend to the joint, or in some in- stances its effects may be most conspicuous in a bursa, which is some- times present in this situation. The disease is exceedingly trouble- some, more particularly if ulceration is present,—an event which is by no means unusual,—for then even the slightest pressure (which is at all times annoying) cannot be borne ; but unless the joint becomes permanently affected, no active surgical means beyond those usually adopted in local inflammations are required ; rest and the horizontal position will be of the utmost consequence if the latter disease be in a state of activity, and, under ordinary circumstances, a shoe made of soft upper leather, and so constructed as to save the part from pres- sure, should always be worn ; no further special instructions seem necessary here, and I will therefore only caution the young surgeon not to mistake a swelling of this kind for a tumour of another cha- racter, and resort to an operation for its removal, which will reflect great discredit on his professional character. The drawing (fig. 132) exhibits an example of the kind of swelling referred to. The tumour in this case was slightly inflamed, but there was no ulceration present. There are few feet where such a projection is not more or less conspicuous, and that here exhibited is below the average size of what is so familiarly known under the title of bunion ; it seems, therefore, sufficiently strange that the true nature of the disease should ever be mistaken ; for in many instances the skin over the end of the metatarsal bone is actually so thin as to permit the outline of its shape to be most distinctly felt, when the fingers are placed over the part. The phalanges of the toes arc liable to various forms of displacement and distortion, from the pressure of overtight shoes, for which no re- medy but that of avoiding the cause will be of any avail ; indeed, in

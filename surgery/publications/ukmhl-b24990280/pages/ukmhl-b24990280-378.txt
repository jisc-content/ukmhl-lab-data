the inferior extremity. 360 employ bis left hand when he stands on the left side of the limb about to be removed. If an operation of this kind is done towards the lower part of the thigh, it is impossible to make the anterior flap sufficiently large unless the skin and other textures are well elevated before the knife is applied. A momentâ€™s reflection on the anatomy of the thigh will be sufficient to convince any one of the greater tendency to shortening of the muscles on its posterior surface than on the anterior: here, with the exception perhaps of the sartorius, which, however, will not be in the anterior flap if the amputation is low down, the only muscle likely to retract much is the rectus, but it lies so close to the bone, and, more- over, its fibres are so peculiarly arranged, that its sphere of contraction is but limited, when compared with that of those on the opposite side, where the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and biceps, with part of the adductor magnus, have so much scope, and are so far separated from the femur, that it would not, judging from physiological considera- tions only, be unreasonable to anticipate very considerable retraction. On the living body this actually occurs, and whatever operation is performed, unless some provision is made on this account, so that at first the parts behind shall be longer than those in front, the stump after a time will never look well. I have now frequently performed amputation in the thigh after this method, and can speak highly in its favour. The following figure (193), taken from a stump made in this way by my colleague Mr. Partridge, shows an ample cushion on all sides, without that prominence in front, formed by the end of the bone, such as is not unfrequently seen in stumps in this part of the limb. The femur is covered with such a mass of soft texures on its whole

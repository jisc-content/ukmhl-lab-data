186 THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. that for fractuve of the upper end of the humerus, great care being taken to keep the arm well up in a sling. I he clavicle is often the seat of fracture, being generally broken about its middle, though either extremity may suffer; a fall, or weight coming on the shoulder, being the most common cause of the injuiy. rhe nature of the case can be made out by the sight alone in many instances, but the application of the fingers will put the matter beyond doubt. When there is much displacement, the outer extremity of the inner fragment will invariably be felt over the other portion of the bone, immediately under the skin, as may be imagined from the accompanying design (fig. 93). ■* The arm should be put up in this wav':—a large pad, composed of tow or hair, or a soft towel folded, should be placed in the axilla, whilst the shoulder is drawn upwards and backwards: a few turns of the roller should then be passed over the shoulder and under the pad, so as to retain the latter in its position; the arm should then be applied close to the side, and fixed with numerous turns of the roller round the chest, as exemplified in figure 90. The starch, as already recommend- ed, will be of great service if used in this case. The figure referred to (although intended to illustrate the mode of treating fractures in the upper end of the humerus) shows the appearance of the parts when thus secured, and the portions of the roller over the shoulders, as there represented, will be of great service in keeping the bandage from slipping down, in all instances when the chest is thus enveloped: these,•particularly that on the left shoulder, may be either outside or inside of those round the chest. Generally it will be found best to apply them outside, and they can be fastened to the others by means of pins, a needle .and thread, or with the starch. Occasionally, a pad

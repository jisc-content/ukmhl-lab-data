THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 264 cause the cartilages to slip forwards, by moving the joint (flexion and extension); and, this being accomplished, restraining for a consider- able time further extensive motion, by means of a bandage or leather cap, so as to give the moveable object a chance of becoming again fixed in its proper position. Notwithstanding the vast natural strength of the hip-joint, as evinced in the shape of the bones and their adaptation to each other, the depth of the socket, and the great power of the surrounding muscles, dislocations are by no means uncommon in this articula- tion. The head of the femur may be thrown upwards on the dor- sum of the ilium, or it may pass backwards, and rest on the mar- gin of, or actually in, the sacro-sciatic notch; in other instances it may pass forwards and inwards so as to rest on the body of the pubes; and in some cases it passes forwards and downwards into Ftp. 144. \ the obturator foramen. The precise spot on which the head of the bone rests is seldom the same in any two cases : upwards, for exam- ple, it has been found to range, in different instances, throughout every point between the anterior spinous processes and the sacro-

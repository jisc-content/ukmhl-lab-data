THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. 520 inner opening (in the fascia transversalis) is in general not far distant from that in the tendon of the external oblique, having by a gradual process passed downwards (or been in a manner dragged by the weight of the protruded viscera) until it has come nearly opposite the latter part, so as to have made the passage from the sac into the abdo- men nearly direct, and diminished the length of the canal, if it can now be called so, to merely the thickness of the abdominal parietes in this situation. In the first of these instances, when the hernia takes an oblique course, the division of the tendon of the external oblique to a small extent may permit the return of the protruded parts ; it may be necessary, however, to cut deeper, and divide the lower margins of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, or the conjoined tendons, or perhaps the neck of the sac, with a portion of the fascia transversalis ; and in the instance where the upper ex- tremity of the canal has come down opposite the lower, the whole of these structures will, in all likelihood, assist more or less in form- ing the' stricture — at all events in cutting it, a small portion of each of them will probably be divided. At this step of the operation the bistoury should be nearly in a parallel direction with the linea alba, and the upper margin of the opening should be the seat of di- vision. The epigastric arteiy will be either on the inner side of the neck of the sac or on the outer, as the case happens to be an oblique hernia or a direct one ; but as the surgeon can seldom be certain as to the nature of the case, it will be better on all occasions to follow the above directions, as this vessel will thus be less endangered than if the incision were carried outwards or inwards, under the supposition of the hernia being oblique or direct, as to which points the operator might find himself mistaken. In dividing the stricture, the point of the knife should be raised from the finger, or it may be gently pushed upwards and forwards by the latter until about one eighth or one fourth of an inch of the textures has been cut, when an attempt may be made to reduce the contents of the sac ; a little pressure should be applied on a part of the bowel nearest the neck of the sac, and if it recedes, the remaining portion will be readily made to follow; if part of the contents of the bowel—even a small quantity of air—can be squeezed into the canal within, the reduction will be much facilitated. If any portion of the omentum be down, it must next be returned, by pushing in that part first which is nearest the abdomen. If there arc extensive adhesions it may be found impossible to re- duce the protruded viscera, and in such a case all that the surgeon can do is to divide the stricture freely; if, on the other hand, the adhe- sions be slight, they may with propriety be destroyed, when reduction may be accomplished. In some instances it is proper practice to re- move a portion of the omentum when it has become much altered in shape, and perhaps irreducible: in such a case a ligature should be applied above the part .about to be divided, one end of which should be left hanging out of the wound, after the upper portion of the omen- tum has been reduced : in other cases it may be advisable to leave the

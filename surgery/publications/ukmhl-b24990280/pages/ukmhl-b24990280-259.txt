241 DISSECTIONS. in the course of the fibres of eacli muscle ; but at the upper region some additional caution is necessary. Immediately below Poupart’s ligament, the fascia is loose in its texture, being thin, and perforated with numerous small apertures for the passage of blood-vessels and nerves; towards the inner margin of the groin, the incisions must be carried deep, so as to raise this membrane from the pectineus muscle ; and, previously to doing so, the saphena vein should be cut across about an inch before it joins the femoral. At the outer end of Poupart’s ligament, below the crest of the ilium, the aponeurosis will be found very thin where it covers the tensor muscle ; indeed, here it seems to be merely a slip of it, as the lower part of this muscle is attached to the outer surface of the main portion of the mem- brane. As the relative anatomy of the femoral artery and its main branches forms one of the principal objects of investigation, the dissection should now be conducted in the following manner:—The sartorius muscle should be carefully cleaned, and each of its margins made dis- tinct ; the cellular texture surrounding the femoral vessels, forming their sheath, should be removed, so as to expose their course between Poupart’s ligament and the inner margin of the sartorius. In making this dissection, the incisions should commence over the common femoral artery, as it passes under Poupart’s ligament, where it will be found about midway between the superior spine of the ilium and tuberosity of the pubes, being, however, a little nearer the latter part than the former: here, in removing the sheath from the artery and vein, notice should be taken of the little slip of cellular tissue which passes between these two vessels, and at the lower part of the dissection the small nerve (n. saphenus) which lies on the sheath under the inner margin of the sartorius should be carefully preserved. The adductor longus and pectineus muscles should now be cleared, as low down as can conve- nient^ be done, without disturbing the vessels or the sartorius from their natural position ; the portions of the psoas magnus and iliacus intemus muscles on the outer side of the common femoral artery should also be clearly made out, and the anterior crural nerve, lying in the fissure between them, with its branches a little lower down, as well as the deep femoral artery and its branches, should likewise be displayed. The upper part of the thigh will now appear thus: the common femoral artery, lying upon the inner margin of the psoas magnus muscle, will be seen passing from under Poupart’s ligament, nearly midway, as already stated, between the two points of bone to which this ligament is attached ; about two inches lower down, it will be observed dividing into the deep and superficial branches, the latter of which passes downwards, under the sartorius muscle, whilst the former speedily divides into its different branches; the common fe- moral vein will be seen on the inner margin of the artery, and a little lower down the vein corresponding to the superficial femoral artery will be observed to occupy a similar position; but where these two vessels lie behind the sartorius, the vein will be nearly covered by the It

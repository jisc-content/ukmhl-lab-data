14 INSTRUMENTS, DISSECTIONS, ance, and keeps well in a dried preparation, should it be thought desirable to prepare any of the parts in this manner, after the vessels have been dissected: but if the dissector be already a little familiar with the parts, they will appear more as they are met with in the living body, if the arteries are not thus distended, and the veins being usually filled with dark blood, there never can be much difficulty in detecting them. The body should be placed on a firm table, of a convenient height, and in a good light. Before using the knife, the contour of each part should be carefully studied; the prominences of bone and muscle should be looked at and fingered, and each joint should be examined, and put through its movements. These matters are too generally neglected in the dissecting-rooms, and I know of no exercise, or minor part of education, if it may be so called, which will be more useful to the young surgeon, in enabling him to detect distortion, whether from disease or accident. Both eyes and fingers may be advan- tageously exercised on these occasions: with the former we can detect the most conspicuous deviations from nature ; but, to make assurance “ doubly sure,” we in general use the latter also ; indeed, in all in- stances, where accurate examination is requisite, we must use the fingers, and by the touch we can often acquire a knowledge of im- portant circumstances, of which we might otherwise be ignorant: we should so use both in the practice of surgery, as to be able to make out the cause of ophthalmia to be an eyelash in contact with the con- junctiva, or the symptoms of ileus to be occasioned by the presence of a small hernial tumour,—too minute to be discerned by the eye, but sufficiently large to be detected with the fingers. Mistakes occa- sionally happen on these points, (I have known them both,) and it is notorious that a common dislocation of the shoulder-joint has often been detected by a glance or touch by one individual, when it had not been discovered by another who had previously examined the case, but who has been devoid of the “ tadits eruditus,” which is considered so essential to the efficient practice of .surgery, and to the acquisition of which, a due attention to the above hints will in no small degree contribute. It will also be well before commencing, to have made some ar- rangements as to the chief objects to be attended to in the dissection. A previous knowledge of descriptive anatomy, and what the dissector may already know of surgery, will enable him to arrange some conve- nient plan : a work on anatomy or surgery may be consulted, but it will be perceived that, in the following pages, every care has been taken to point out the manner of displaying each part to the greatest advantage for surgical purposes. The dissection may now be commenced, and pursued in accordance with the object in view. It is a good general rule, in prosecuting sur- gical anatomy, to cut away as few textures as possible, and to displace no structure until its relations to the neighbouring organs have been fully examined. In order to examine deep-seated parts, it is necessary

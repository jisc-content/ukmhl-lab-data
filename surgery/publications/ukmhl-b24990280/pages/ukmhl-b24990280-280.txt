262 THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. Fig. 143. Fig. 142. to understand that the knee may be greatly bent, as is conspicuous in one of the casts at Kingâ€™s College. In reducing dislocations of the head of the tibia, the extending force, whether by means of the hands or the pulleys, should be ap- plied to the upper part of the leg, and it may be advantageous to fix the counter-extension on the pelvis, so as to avoid pressure on the muscles of the thigh, which might thereby be prevented from being relaxed or elongated, or perhaps might even be irritated into contrac- tion. The difficulty in effecting the object of the operation will not in general be very great ; and, provided there has been no serious in- jury of the soft parts, or, in other words, no extensive displacement, a extensive laceration of ligaments and other textures which happens in either instance, the projection of the lower part of the femur back- wards may overstretch and lacerate the popliteal artery. I have seen this happen in one instance, but in that case the displacement was such that the condyles of the femur were forced through the skin of the ham. The preceding figures (140 and 141) exhibit the displace- ments backwards and forwards, and those which follow (142 and 143) display the partial luxations laterally. The large bones have alone been displayed, as, if the patella had been left, or any of the soft parts, the young student might have had some difficulty in appre- ciating the nature of each. The limbs are here represented in almost straight positions, but in such extensive injuries it will not be difficult

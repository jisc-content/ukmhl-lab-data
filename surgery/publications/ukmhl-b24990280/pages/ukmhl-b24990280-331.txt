LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. 313 a little above its passage through the adductor raagnus, the operation has been done for secondary hemorrhage in the leg, after amputation ; I know of no particular advantage in selecting this situation, unless it be that in the event of secondary bleeding at the seat of de- ligation, there is still another chance left for the patient of having the same vessel tied a little higher up; neither is there any great disadvantage, for I attach no consequence to the arguments that high inflammation with abscess or diffuse suppuration is more likely to fol- low here than nearer the groin: considering, however, that in the upper third of the thigh, the vessel is much more easily reached, that there must he less disturbance of parts, and that the operation must be equally efficient,—I cannot but recommend the selection of the operation in this situation. The circumstance of secondary hemor- rhage is one of grave importance; yet, in my opinion any calcu- lations as to its probability of occurrence should not deter the sur- geon from the operation above the sartorius, which seems to me, under nearly every circumstance, that which is most eligible. Here the vessel is to be secured towards the lower angle of that triangular space so particularly referred to by Scarpa, which is described at p. 241. The operation may be performed in this manner:—The patient being placed on his back, with the limb bent as already directed, the surgeon should feel for the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and for the tuberosity of the pubes; nearly midway between these points he will discover the femoral pulsating, and about two inches below he should commence his incision through the skin, and carry it downwards for three inches and a half, in a direction parallel with the axis of the limb, and consequently parallel with the superficial femo- ral : the skin being divided, the aponeurosis of the thigh will next be exposed by division of the superficial fascia, and here, perhaps, a few lymphatic glands may be met with; the aponeurosis being now cut through, some fibres of the sartorius may probably be seen, and the sheath of the vessels will be exposed: this latter texture being cau- tiously opened to the extent of a quarter of an inch, or less, the artery- may be recognized, and the needle passed around it from within out- wards. If the first incision is placed as above directed, and if the operator takes care to go neither to one side nor the other, the vessel can scarce- ly be missed ; yet 1 have known a surgeon pass an inch deeper on its inner side. The pulsations of the artery will form a good guide in general; and when there is any difficulty, a reference to the sartorius muscle will be of service, provided the incisions have been made suffi- ciently low to expose its fibres. In this situation, as in most other parts of the body, I believe, as has already been stated in the intro- duction to this work, that a knowledge of the appearance of tex- tures is of the greatest value in enabling the surgeon to complete the operation in a safe and satisfactory- manner., The internal saphena vein may possibly be seen in the first inci-

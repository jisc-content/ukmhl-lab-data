This caution should not be overlooked even, as already stated in a preceding page, in the case of fracture of one bone only ; and in most instances, parti- cularly when the fore-arm is thin and flat, it will be a wise precaution to lay a pad along each surface before the splints are applied. If the fractures are near to the elbow, they may be treated much in the manner recommended for those in the lower end of the humerus. Compound fractures are by no means unusual in the fore-arm, but unless the injury be otherwise severe, such cases generally do well. Sometimes everything will go on as in simple fractures, at other times there may be diffuse inflammation, suppuration, exfoliation, and the usual train of misfortunes resulting from compound fractures else- where ; but even in most unfavourable looking cases the surgeon should never resort to amputation while there is the slightest hope of saving the hand ; for however unwieldy the part, it will assuredly be better than any substitute which can be afterwards made use of. In such cases the pads, splints, and bandages will not require to be ma- terially different from those which are used in other instances, al- though it may be requisite to adjust them in such a way that proper care can be taken of the external wound. The formation of a false joint may follow such injuries (simple or Fig. 84. Fig. 85.

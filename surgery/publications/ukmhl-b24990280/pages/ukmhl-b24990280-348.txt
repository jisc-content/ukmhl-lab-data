THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 330 sion has been sustained with impunity by a third class! but such practice cannot, in my opinion, be recommended ; and I feel, more- over, bound to state, that even the method of gradual extension to which approval has been given, must be cautiously resorted to,—all tendency to disease must have ceased, otherwise the slight stretching of contracted textures, and altered relative position of parts, may pro- duce alarming inflammation in and around the joint. If, however, the disease has seemingly been cured, the extending process, provided bony anchylosis is not present, may be applied in certain individuals, with great freedom. An instance has lately come under my notice, where the limb in a boy of nine years old, from having been bent at a right angle, has been brought to a straight line by gradual extension after division of the hamstrings: the tibia in this case, however, which ori- ginally only touched the back of the condyles, still occupies that situar tion, being now much in the same position as if displaced backwards by accident; therefore doubts may be entertained as to the future utility of the limb, and whether, with such a result, amputation would not, after all, have been the best proceeding for the patient’s after comfort. The mutilation of the body should at all times be a last resource; yet, in some of these examples, when the member proves a source of an- noyance to the individual, I believe that such a proceeding may, probably, even yet, with all our knowledge of what has recently been done, be most advisable.

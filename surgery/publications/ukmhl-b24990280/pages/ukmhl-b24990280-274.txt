256 THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. Fig. 133. parts above described can be attended with little or no difficulty, and I believe that there will be more likelihood of saving the foot by this proceeding than by replacing it. The success of this practice has been so frequently proved, that in any instance of displacement of the bone, where the skin and other textures happened to be-extensively stretched, although not torn or wounded, and where I found it impos- sible to reduce the dislocation, I should consider that there would be less risk were the bone cut down' upon and removed, than if it were left in its new and unnatural position, more particularly if immediate union of the wound were effected, and great care were taken to subdue the inflammation likely to result from such an extensive injury. I have met with one example of an unreduced dislocation of the astragalus forwards ; the accident had occurred many years previously, and the person, an active old soldier, had regained a tolerable use of the foot and new ankle-joint, which was formed partly on the upper surface of the os calcis and posterior portion of the displaced bone ; he required the use of a stick, however, and walked on the fore part of the foot, which was pointed downwards, like a person who has reco- vered from hip disease after dislocation of the femur, of which distor- tion there is a good illustration in page 268. Dislocation of the foot at the ankle-joint is more frequently met with than the cases last alluded to ; the foot may be thrown back- wards or forwards, and in either example there can be no difficulty in perceiving its nature, by the increase or the diminution of the pro- jection of the heel. The first of these is represented in this sketch, (fig. 133,) in which

The point should be entered about one inch and three fourths in front of the anus, about a lineâ€™s breadth left of the raphe, pushed through the skin, and earned by a kind of saw- ing motion down to the left side of the perineum, about an inch beyond the anus, the middle of the incision being at equal distances from the latter part and the tuberosity, as indicated by the line on the accompanying drawing (fig. 240) ; next, the blade should be run Fig. 240. along the surface of the exposed cellular tissue, and then the point of the forefinger of the left hand should be thrust into the wound a little in front of the anus, so as to penetrate between the accelerator urinae muscle and the erector, the knife being applied to any part which offers resistance ; now with a little force the finger can be placed upon the membranous portion of the urethra, and the groove in the staff, and the blade, with the flat surfaces nearly horizontal, should be car- ried along above the finger, made to perforate the urethra about three lines in front of the prostate, and then be slid along the groove until it has entered the bladder, having slit open the side of the urethra and notched the margin of the prostate in its course. In withdrawing the knife,'if the stone is supposed to be of considerable magnitude, the blade should be kept a little out of the groove, so as to increase the incision of the prostate. The forefinger of the left hand should next be slipped slowly into the bladder along the staff, and in such a manner as to cause dilation of the surrounding textures, and its point should be moved about in search of the stone, which being found, should be retained in a position near the neck of the viscus ; then the assistant should be desired to remove the staff, and the surgeon should

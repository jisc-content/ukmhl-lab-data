THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 196 Fig. 98. flow of blood, until a dish convenient for its reception is held opposite the wound : the thumb should then be raised, and after the quantity of blood required has been allowed to escape, the bandage should be loosened, when the stream will immediately cease to flow. A few folds of lint or linen rag, about two inches square, should then be put over the wound, care being taken that its edges are in close contact, and the bandage which has been already in use should be put round the elbow in the form of the figure 8, the arm being kept slightly bent. This is one of the operations where it will occasionally be more convenient to use the lancet with the left hand than with the right. In opening a vein on the left arm, for example, it will be best to use the left hand, as the surgeon can stand behind the arm, and avoid the first jet of blood. In all instances of this operation, every care should be taken to perform it in as cleanly a manner as the circumstances will permit, so as not to bespatter any of the surrounding objects, more particularly the patientâ€™s body or bed-clothes; and the more effectually to guard against this, the precaution of placing a towel to protect the parts beneath should not be omitted. It is seldom indeed that any evils result from the above operation, but such as they are may be treated according to the observations which may be found in the introductory section of this work, or in those devoted to the injury of the humeral artery occurring during the use of the lancet in this situation.

284 THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. From day to day the position of the fragments must be carefully examined : occasionally a bandage must be loosened or tightened, or some little change may be necessary to obviate undue pressure on any particular point. The heel suffers most in this respect, and injury is best obviated by a just adaptation of stuffing under the lower third of the leg, by which the weight of the limb is diffused over a great ex- tent of surface, instead of being allowed to press upon one part only. It is customary to keep the knee slightly bent, this attitude being most agreeable to the patient; but it will occasionally be perceived that the broken end of the upper fragment has a tendency to rise, and, by fretting the inner surface of the skin, endangers the safety of the limb by exciting suppuration and ulceration. I have known simple fractures thus converted into compound ones, and in several instances have seen the worst possible results ensue. To obviate the dangers above alluded to, the foot should be placed nearly on the same level as the knee; the leg, from the knee downwards, should be kept a little above the level of the sound limb by placing a square block of wood under the lower end of the splint; or it may be found most convenient to keep the latter almost straight, and allow it to rest on the mattress. In the early years of my practice I was induced, from education and example, to consider the double-inclined plane as the most eligible method of treating all such fractures as have lately been referred to ; within these few years, however, I have often had good reason to doubt the advantage of this system in all cases, as well as to admire the comparative comfort afforded to the patient, by placing the whole limb, from the hip downwards, nearly on the same line with that of the sound side. The appa- ratus above recommended will answer in any attitude which will be found most convenient, whether as a double-inclined plane, as a hori- zontal plane from the knee to the foot, or from the hip downwards : the screw will regulate the relative positions of the leg and thigh plates, and by having the foot-board so constructed that it can be made, at the will of the surgeon, to slope outwards or inwards, in either of which positions he can counteract any tendency to displace- ment or twisting in the opposite directions, the apparatus seems to me as simple and efficient as any with which I am acquainted. I have often thought that an erroneous idea is too prevalent that such a splint can only be used with propriety when the knee is kept in the bent position; but,from what has been stated, it will be observed that it may be used under any circumstances. In certain fractures it will be found difficult, with the ordinary foot-board, to prevent the toes turning outwards or inwards, particu- larly in the latter direction; but with one, such as has lately been adapted to this splint, having a kind of hinge near the heel, which permits of lateral movements, these difficulties will be more readily overcome than by the usual means of pads placed alongside of the foot, which here, as in other parts of the limb, always convey a certain

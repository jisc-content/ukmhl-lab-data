24 MEANS AND INSTRUMENTS on the strap of the instrument, may be used ; or, what I consider better (such as exhibited in the other cuts), a hard roll of calico, about two inches in length and one in thickness, is to be put on the skin over and parallel with the course of the main artery, and secured there by one or two turns of its free end; the strap of the instrument is then to be carried round the limb, and fastened by means of the buc- kle, when the requisite amount of pressure can be applied by turning the screw. The latter movement effects the separation of the two plates with which the strap is connected, and thus diminishes the circumference of that part which is round the limb, and at the same time forces the roller against the artery. If care be not taken in its application, there may be as much danger in trusting to this instru- ment as to the fingers; the strap must be strong enough not to break on the application of any reasonable degree of force. It seems to me of little consequence on which side the screw is placed: some prefer it over the main artery, others directly on the opposite surface of the limb, but in any way the roller or pad must be directly over the vessel, and the buckle must not be so close to the plates as to come in contact with them, when the screw is turned. After the vessels are cut in an amputation, it is sometimes found necessary to apply additional pressure, which could not possibly be done were the buckle close to the plates. It is of consequence, too, that when the strap is fastened in the buckle, the screw should be immediately turned, for a very slight pressure round the limb, even that occasioned by the weight of the tourniquet, will retard the circulation through the veins, the superficial in particular; and thus, whilst the blood still passes, in its usual full stream, into the lower part of the limb, a considerable accumulation occurs in the veins below the instrument, and a larger quantity is lost during the operation, than can be deemed in accordance with good surgery. There are other pieces of apparatus which may be used for the same purposes as the tourniquet, but the above, since its invention by Petit, has generally been considered the most perfect, and it is an instrument which every surgeon should have in his possession. Though he may dispense with its use, when surrounded by able assistants, and is himself possessed of great self-confidence, he may, on some occasions, have reason to regret that one has not been at hand; or even should this never be so, he will, at best, only display a degree of foolish vanity in his own resources or good fortune, if, in vaunting of his temerity, he attempts to bring into desuetude an instrument which has the sanction of the highest authorities, and which has been so long considered indispensable in the practice of sm-gery. Various pieces of mechanism have been used and recommended, as tourniquets; but I know of none worthy of superseding that just referred to. Of late, a very ingenious and simple foreign contrivance has been exhibited by some of our instrument-makers, consisting of two elliptical bars, joined at two ends by a kind of hinge, where they are so acted on by a screw, that the other two ends, which are pro-

564 THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. citement: next, when the curved point is fairly within the cavity, he should cautiously feel for the stone, as in the process of sounding al- ready described: then having touched it, he opens the blades by drawing the inner one towards him, and pushing the outer a little onwards, until he supposes the gap sufficient to include the calculus, when he turns their points, and dips the whole end of the instrument in the supposed direction of the stone, then pushes them towards each other, and thus grasps the object: this being done, he should move the instrument slightly by way of making sure that he has not included part of the mucous membrane, and being satisfied on this score, he should apply the handle (fig. 232), and by turn- ing it in the manner indicated by the ac- companying drawing (fig. 233), should force the inner blade onwards, either by a continued turn of the hand, or by sudden and short jerks, so as to imitate slight per- cussions, until the object is shattered, when he may repeat the proceedings on one or more of the fragments, according to Fig. 232. Fig. 233. circumstances. Perhaps one proceeding may suffice if the stone is small; but more frequently the different portions have to be touched, and the repetitions must be resorted to at intervals of two days, or more, according to the condition of the bladder above referred to. Previous to the performance of each operation, the patient should be desired to retain his water for a couple of hours or more, or else some tepid fluid must be thrown in immediately before. When the cavity is tolerably distended, the instrument moves about with more facility and less pain to the patient,â€”besides the stone is more isolated, as it were, and the blades can be placed on each side of it with less risk to the tunics. Usually towards the end of each proceeding, the bladder

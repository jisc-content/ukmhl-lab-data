274 THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. position, and. indeed, perhaps, this force is more essential in such a case than extension. The displacement into the thyroid foramen is probably the most rare that occurs at this articulation ; like the rest, it too seems to be overlooked in some cases. The attitude somewhat resembles that of the kind last referred to ; but the limb is more bent on the pelvis, considerably elongated, and, as it were, thrown downwards and forwards. The flatness of the hip, the sinking of the trochanter, and the natural condition of the pubes, contrasted with the dislocation last-described, will sufficiently indicate the true nature of the case; and besides, as was very distinctly ob- served in an instance that occurred to me in Edinburgh, a degree of swelling may be noticed in the upper and inner part of the thigh, oc- casioned by the head of the bone in its new situation. Extension can scarcely be deemed requisite in effecting reduction in this case : I am inclined, however, to recommend a slight degree of it, as the patient's body can thus be kept more steady. Transverse force must then be applied in the manner above-described, and in all likelihood the parts

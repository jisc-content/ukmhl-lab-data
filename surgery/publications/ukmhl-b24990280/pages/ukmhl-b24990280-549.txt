In some instances it may be found most convenient to hook the apex of the finger behind the point of the blade, and thus in a manner to force the cutting edge through the parts which must to be divided. It is scarcely requisite to point out, that if the opening in the skin has been some way from the anus, the sphincter muscle must be divided in the incision ; indeed, with few exceptions, the success of the operation seems to depend Fig. 227. chiefly on this circumstance. When the sinus is thus laid open, it is well to push the finger into the track to ascertain that there has been no off-set from it.

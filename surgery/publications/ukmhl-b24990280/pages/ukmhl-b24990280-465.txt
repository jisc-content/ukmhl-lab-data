OPERATION FOR STRABISMUS. 447 my limits will not permit me to dwell upon. The removal of foreign substances from the surface, the mode of using the lancet in dividing enlarged vessels—as in chronic inflammation, the manner of dissecting off a pterygium, of separating an encanthis, of removing a staphy- loma, of making an artificial pupil, and conducting various proceedings on the iris, are all treated of at length in works devoted to ophthalmic surgery, but which, in a work such as this, where the use of the fingers and instruments forms such frequent subject of consideration, may on that account be omitted, to make room for other and, perhaps, more important matters. One, however, I must not pass over without description, that is, the operation for strabismus, regarding which so much has been said, written, and done, within the last three years. The merit belongs to DiefFenbach of having discovered, that division of one or more of the muscles of the eyeball permits the others to restore it to its natural position ; thus, in strabismus convergens where the inner side of the cornea approaches or is concealed by the plica semilunaris, division of the internal rectus allows the other muscles to give the globe a more natural balance ; and so in that form termed divergens, the section of the external rectus puts all to rights. Since the principle has been established an infinite variety of modifications have been proposed and executed, and considering the zeal with which the subject has been cultivated, the success of the operation, its advantages and simplicity— both as regards its performance and results, it seems strange that such a condition as a confirmed squint should now-a-days ever be seen. The operation may be done thus: Supposing that the right eye is affected with convergent squint, the patient should he seated on a chair, the eyelids should be held open with the fingers, or what will be better for the upper lid a Pellier’s elevator should be hooked under it, and then a small double hook (made expressly for the purpose) should be passed into the sclerotic, or through the conjunctiva at all events, about a line’s breadth from the inner margin of the cornea, both of these being held by an assistant; the eye should then be drawn slightly outwards ; the surgeon standing in front should now seize, with well-pointed forceps, a fold of mucous membrane at the inner canthus, and with scissors such as those represented at p. 6, the points not being so sharp, however, he should divide the conjunctiva in a vertical direction as is represented in the next drawing, (fig. 204,) so as to make a wound about half an inch in length between two and three lines from the cornea: the tendon of the internal rectus will thus be laid bare and can then be divided with the same instrument ; next the hook should be removed, the forceps loosened, when if it be' found that the eye is straight, and can no longer be turned towards the nose, the operation may be deemed complete. If, however, the squint still continues, the eye must be again fixed and the scissors re- applied, when some remaining fibre, which probably kept the organ in its wrong position, will be divided, and then all will be right. It may even yet be necessary to cut again, and some of the "fibres of tlic

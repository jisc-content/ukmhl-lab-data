LITHOTOMY. 567 I propose here, in accordance with the arrangements in other parts of this work, to limit my notice of lithotomy to an exposition of the practice which I myself should follow, and of which I can speak from personal experience. Cutting on the gripe is not practised by any surgeon of the present day; the operation with the apparatus major is equally obsolete ; the high operation is hut little followed unless by the distinguished Souberbielle, or in instances where other modes are not deemed eligible ; the recto-vesical method has few if any advocates ; the bilateral proceeding is but rarely pursued, and has never, to my knowledge, been performed in this country with the double lithotome; the cutting gorget, from all I can perceive, is getting more and more into disuse ; and the lateral operation, as practised by Jaques in his latter years, by Rau and by Cheselden, seems, with few exceptions, to be that in most common use among the modem surgeons of this country. The whole proceedings as practised by some in the present day so nearly resemble those of the last-named most distinguished of all British lithotomists, that the custom prevails more than ever of calling the operation Cheselden’s. With some slight modifications, the following is a description of the proceeding, and such as I should re- commend :—Every care being taken, as in all other operations, whether capital or not, that the patient is in as favourable a condition as cir- cumstances will permit, the perineum should be shaved, a clyster of warm water should be administered about an hour before, and he should be desired to retain his urine until the operation. Before the appointed time the surgeon, particularly in the early part of his prac- tice, should ascertain that there is a good stout table in the apartment, and also a chair, each of a proper height in proportion to his own taste and size ; and here too, as in all other operations of great magnitude, he should see that all his apparatus is in perfect order, as has been especially noticed in some of the early chapters in this volume. Everything being prepared, the first step is to introduce the staff, which should be as large as the urethra will admit with ease, and of such a shape as that here represented (fig. 237), having the groove

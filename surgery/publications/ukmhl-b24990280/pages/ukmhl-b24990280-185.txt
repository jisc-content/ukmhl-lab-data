167 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SIIOULDER-JOINT. f t with, more particularly when the head of the humerus is in the axilla, in which it will not answer. If it be found necessary, a prodigious additional power may be gained by passing a towel under the axilla, and desiring an assistant to pull upwards, whilst the surgeon increases the extending force, as he throws his body backwards, by having had, whilst in the sitting posture and slightly stooping, the band attached to the patient’s arm fixed round his own shoulders. This drawing Fig. 77. (fig. 77) will convey a very distinct idea of the most important features of the explanation above given. These are the methods of reducing dislocations of the shoulder-joint, which, in so far as I am aware, are most commonly in use; there are others, however, which some consider equally efficient, and for a de- scription of which I must refer to the works of Pare and Scultetus, to Heister’s surgery, or other systematic authorities of the last and preceding century. The ancient ambi, the scala, and the glossocoma, are now looked upon with interest, only as relics of bygone ages : although Mr. Bransby Cooper relates the case of a farmer near Nor- wich, who, being frequently the subject of luxation of the humerus into the axilla, used to “ do the doctor,” by suspending himself over a gate, his body on one side, his arm on the other, we no longer hear of patients being suspended by the armpit over the upper bar of a lad- der, or the top of a door, nor hung from the ceiling by the wrist of the injured arm, with the sanction of the modern surgeon. Though the pathology of luxations in this joint is now better known than in former times, the history of their treatment clearly shows, that it would indeed be diflicult to resort to any method which has not pre-

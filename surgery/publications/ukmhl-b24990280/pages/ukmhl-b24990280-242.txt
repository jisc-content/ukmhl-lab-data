THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 224 Fig. 123. pocket-case (no saw being required), I can see no good reason for pre- ferring it to the more common operation a little higher up. Amputation in the fore-arm may be done in this waythe elbow being slightly bent, and the hand placed in a state of pronation, a blade about six inches long should be passed from one side to the other behind (or above) the bones; it should then be carried in an oblique direction, so as to come through the skin about an inch and a half lower down; the flap thus formed should now be raised, and the knife should next be passed across close in front of the bones, and then carried obliquely downwards, when a second flap, similar in size and shape to that already made, will be formed: both of these should now be drawn slightly upwards, and after all the textures close upon the bones have been divided with the same knife, care being taken to pass its point between them, the saw should be applied close to the roots of the flaps, and the part separated. If the latter instru- ment be well used, it is of little moment whether a single bone or both be cut at once. Some prefer to place the hand about to be removed in a state of supination, and to make the anterior flap first: others hold it between pronation and supination; but I have never been convinced that, under ordinary circumstances, any one of these three positions possesses such advantages over the other two, as should induce the surgeon to prefer it in all instances. It is of consequence, however, to observe the attitude in which the limb may be placed, Â«

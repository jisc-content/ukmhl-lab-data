357 AMPUTATIONS OF THE THIGH. practical suygeon to prefer it to the ordinary method below or above the articulation. Since the operation was done by Hoin in 1764, it has been occasionally performed, and the results coming under Vel- peauâ€™s observation seem to have been favourable enough. Being in no position to speak from personal experience on such a proceeding, I shall not dwell on the subject further than to state, that by making a semilunar incision in front, extending from one side of the knee to the other, then passing through the joint, by dividing the mucous, lateral, and crucial ligaments, and reserving another semilunar flap behind, there, can be little difficulty in forming a covering to the end of the femur, notwithstanding the great extent of articular surface. The patella may be left, or removed, according to circumstances. It need scarcely be added, that the operation can be thought of only when the end of the femur is unaffected by disease or accident. Amputation in the thigh may be performed in a variety of ways : perhaps the following, which is in most respects similar to that ori- ginally done by Vermale, may be found as efficient in every respect as any other, more especially in the lower third of the member. The femoral artery being commanded, as described and represented at pp. 20 and 23, the surgeon, standing on the outside of the limb, should grasp the outer side of the thigh between his fingers and thumb, and having drawn them as it were from the side of the bone, should pass the knife from before backwards, or rather from above downwards, as it is here represented (fig. 190), and then cut down-

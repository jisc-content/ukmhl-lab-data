2 SURGICAL ANATOMY. gives but an imperfect idea of what is met with during the operation. Perhaps, before the knife is used, the skin and other textures to which it is to be applied, may have become inflamed and swollen,—• infiltrated with serum or sero-purulent fluid, and consequently much altered from their more healthy condition: even under more ordinary circumstances where inflammation has not as yet attacked those textures, the skin, fasciae, and openings are all very different from the usual appearances met with in the dissecting-room: the hernial sac on many occasions bears but a slight resemblance to the peritoneum, and the bowels generally present few traces of what is usually con- sidered the healthy condition. It may be affirmed that the elements of Surgical Anatomy can only be acquired by application to the healthy frame, and that a compre- hensive knowledge of it can never be obtained without a study of the effects of disease and accident. In some rare instances, as for the performance of certain amputations, or ligature of main arteries, (ope- rations generally done at a distance from the seat of disease,) a knowledge of healthy anatomy is what is chiefly required by the operator; but in the greater number of instances, when a practitioner’s knowledge of Surgical Anatomy is called into requisition, there is a necessity that it should be much more comprehensive than is required merely for the appreciation of healthy textures. From what I have stated, then, it will appear, that I include a certain amount of knowledge of what is termed Pathological Anatomy in my definition of Surgical Anatomy ; and I need not here do more than simply state, that I cannot believe any one to possess a compe- tent acquaintance with either of these two departments of knowledge, who is not conversant with what is termed Descriptive or Elementary, and also with General Anatomy. Having this extended view of Surgical Anatomy, I shall in the following pages, when I deem the subject of much importance, not confine my descriptions to the healthy parts alone, but shall occa- sionally digress, when I think I can do so with advantage. Indeed, without a constant reference to injuries and surgical diseases, I can- not conceive it possible to treat of the subject of Surgical Anatomy with much practical efficiency. Under the term Practical Surgery, I shall include the symptoms of disease and injury, the principles and objects of treatment, and such medicinal means of cure as seem to me to belong to the province of surgery ; and under what is commonly called Operative Surgery, I shall describe not only those operations which are performed with cutting instruments, but also the various duties required on the part of the surgeon, as in the setting of fractured bones, reduction of dis- locations, application of bandages, and other manipulations of Practical Surgery.

Here I re- solved to be guided by what I ascer- tained during the progress of the operation, and in performing it, find- ing that the disease was limited to the fore-finger and its sustaining bone, I was enabled to preserve the rest of the hand, as here represent- ed (fig. 120). The proceeding was accomplished much in the manner already described for removing the index finger. The next drawing (fig. 121) ex- hibits a large fibrous tumour con- nected with the middle of the palm, and with the middle and ring- fingers. It is the largest of the kind which I have seen ; but we have the cast of a larger one in the Museum at King’s College, and Fig. 121. there is one of greater magnitude portrayed in the third volume of the quarto edition of John Bell’s Surgery. Here I intended to re- move both the affected fingers and their metacarpal bones, but the patient refused to submit to an operation, although he had come many miles for the purpose of having one performed.

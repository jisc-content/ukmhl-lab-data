THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 17G water, or not, previous to application ; I think this of little conse- quence : but, whenever it is done, care should be taken that the sub- stance is not too much softened, lest, under the supposed security of the splint, displacement occur again ere the latter hardens and assumes a permanent form. The ulna may be broken at any part of its course. Figure 81 exhibits the fissure in a part of the bone which is often the seat of fracture. It may be lower, however; but the additional strength higher up gives considerable security to this extremity of the shaft. Here, also, as with the radius, the fragments may lean to the oppo- site bone ; and I must, therefore, beg attention to my remarks in re- ference to the treatment of fracture in both bones. A fall or blow will probably be the cause of such a fracture. I once treated an in- stance of the latter kind, about three inches above the carpus, which was occasioned by the patient, in striking downwards, hitting the back of a chair, not being aware of its presence. The treatment differs in no respect from that of similar accidents in the radius. When the olecranon process, however, is broken, the case is more serious; for, in addition to the fracture, there is an injury of the joint. In an instance of this kind I once found it necessary to per- Fig. 81.

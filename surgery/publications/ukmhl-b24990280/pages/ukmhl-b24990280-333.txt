LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. 315 nicnce of displaying the lines, the artist has kept the limb in a straighter position than has been above described. Secondary hemorrhage occasionally occurs after ligature of the su- perficial femoral artery, and often, too, in instances where it might be least expected. Two examples have happened in my own experience, and in neither of these instances was the artery disturbed in an unusual manner, or divested of its sheath to a greater extent than to allow the point of the needle to be passed, nor was the ligature placed nearer than an inch to the deep femoral. In such cases a question will arise regarding the course of practice to be followed :— If the vessel has originally been tied in the middle of the thigh, I should be most inclined to place another ligature on the same vessel higher up,—that is, several inches higher, above the sartorius ; but if the operation has already been done in this situation, the question may be, whether the vessel should be again tied at the same place, or that a ligature be cast on the common femoral or exter- nal iliac. If either of the latter operations be adopted, it will be observed that the circulation through the deep femoral will be obstructed, and that consequently there may be such a deficiency of blood in the limb afterwards as to end in mortification. In ligature of either the femoral or external iliac, as a primary operation, such an event is of rare occurrence; but the circumstances are very different in the case at present under consideration: here not even the smallest quantity of blood can be expected to flow by the superficial femoral, supplied either by a retrograde current through its deep branch, or through the epigastric; whilst, in a primary operation on the iliac, this may reasonably be calculated on, even in an instance of aneurism in the groin,— the current at first being sufficient to give effective assist- ance to the other channels of circulation which support the vitality of the limb below, but yet not so strong as to prevent the favourable changes in the tumour, which tend to the cure. In secondary bleed- ing from the superficial femoral, the retrograde circulation referred to above must be prevented by pressure over the bleeding orifice and the course of the main artery, otherwise, even after ligature of the external iliac, the hemorrhage, though checked in its impe- tuosity, might still continue to an injurious extent. In one of my own cases, on the sixteenth day after deligation of the superficial femoral in the groin, a ligature was applied to the exter- nal iliac, and also slight pressure in the groin over the course of the open vessel, to check secondary bleeding : these had the desired effect; but mortification of the whole limb, from the foot to the hip, speedily ensued, and death was the result. The loss of vitality seemed at first to be confined to the lower part of the limb, and I was, therefore, in- duced to amputate in the thigh, but the stump within twenty-four hours became similarly affected. I confess that I should feel reluctant to fol- low this practice in a similar case, and should be more inclined to place ligatures immediately above and below the bleeding orifice, though such

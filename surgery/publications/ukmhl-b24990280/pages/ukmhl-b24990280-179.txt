DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. 161 The attention may now be directed to dislocations of the shoulder- joint, which, in one form or other, are of such frequent occurrence. When this joint is examined anatomically, it will be readily perceived that its weakest part is below, in the space between the teres minor and subscapularis, where it is protected neither by muscles nor tendons, and where, moreover, the capsular ligament is less likely to restrain the head of the bone than at any other point. These cir- cumstances, combined with the lever force of the humerus when a person falls with the arm thrown forwards for protection, may account for the frequency of dislocation of the head of the bone in this situa- tion. It is impossible in most instances to ascertain the position of the limb previous to the accident, nor is it of much consequence to know whether the displacement has been occasioned whilst the arm has been raised from the side, or by direct violence over the shoulder, as undoubtedly may be the case. In whatever way it may be ac- counted for, the accident—displacement into the axilla as it is called —is of more common occurrence than any other sort of dislocation in this joint. The bones occupy this position (fig. 71) ; the head of the Fir,. 71. humerus rests on the margin of the scapula below its neck, in front of the attachment of the long head of the triceps, and it may be slightly in the substance of the subscapular muscle, as may be imagined from an examination of the drawing.

435 OPERATION FOR HYDROCEPHALUS. ceive that necrosis might follow: or, should suppuration ensue, it is possible that matter might collect between the cranium and dura mater. Incisions may sometimes be necessary to facilitate the re- moval of necrosed portions of bone here, and they may also be required in the treatment of aneurisms by anastomosis, when such practice is resorted to, but no special rules further than those already given in different parts of the volume are applicable to this locality. In incisions required for the latter disease, the surgeon will of course be prepared for copious hemorrhage; but I may here caution the young practi- tioner, that the bleeding is usually very active from all incised wounds of the scalp, whether in a state of health or not. The practice of puncturing through the fontanel with a small trochar and canula in cases of chronic hydrocephalus needs no parti- cular notice here. It is a proceeding which can be thought of only in early infancy, while the over-distended cranium is as yet soft and pliable, and is certainly one attended with great immediate danger,â€” not from the puncture, which is a very simple matter, but from the inflammation likely to succeed. I have seen only one instance where the method was resorted to, and it occurred in the practice of my friend Dr. Wm. Campbell of Edinburgh. The patient was a new- born infant with congenital disease: a puncture was made a little to one side of the mesial line \(to avoid the longitudinal sinus) a large quantity of fluid was evacuated, and a roller compressed the head to a natural size. No bad effects followed, but in the course of a few weeks the fluid had again collected: another puncture was made, and death from inflammation ensued.

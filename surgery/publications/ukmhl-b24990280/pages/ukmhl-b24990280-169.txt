151 DISLOCATIONS OF FINGERS. (58) of a dislocation of the index finger backwards, will have all the advantage of a firmer hold, and a more powerful lever. The Fig. 58. middle and ring fingers are so well protected by their position, that dislocations of the head of either on the metacarpal bone, is of rare occurrence, unless the injury to the hand is severe and complicated. The phalanges of the thumb may suffer like those of the fingers, and the preceding observations are equally applicable here. The dis- Fig. 59- tal joint is seldom the seat of simple luxation, however, the proximal phalanx being most frequently displaced ; and it may be either in front or behind the end of the metacarpal bone, as exhibited in the accom- panying figures (59 and 60). Fig. 60. The displacement of the first phalanx backwards (fig. 601, or, as some describe it, of the metacarpal bone forwards, has attracted con-

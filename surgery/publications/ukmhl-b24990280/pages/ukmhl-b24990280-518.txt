500 CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. fasciae must cover the sac, and the difference between the thickness of the cremaster muscle with the cellular texture binding its fibres toge- ther, and the infundibuliform fascia, on the one hand, and the fascia transversalis with the cellular texture between it and the sac on the other, is so little appreciable as to be unworthy of notice in a surgical point of view. An inguinal hernia may be so small as scarcely' to be observed,— nay, it may be so very' minute, as not even to be detected during life, —as I have known in two cases, where all the symptoms of strangu- lated hernia were present, when the most careful examination was made by very competent surgeons without the protrusion being de- tected until dissection after death, or the sac mayr be so capacious, as to contain a large proportion of the contents of the abdomen; the pro- trusion may not pass so low as the aperture in the tendon of the ex- ternal oblique, as was the case in the instances above alluded to, or it may, as must happen in all large tumours of the kind, pass to the lowest part of the scrotum. There may be an inguinal hernia without it being a scrotal, or in other words the protrusion mayr not have passed down to the scrotum ; but a scrotal hernia must of necessity' pass through the lower end of the inguinal canal; hence it will be observed that the scrotal hernia is merely a larger form of -protrusion through the inguinal canal. When there is difficulty in reducing a hernial tumour by the taxis, the propriety of bending the patient’s body forwards, and raising the thigh, so as to relax the abdominal parietes and Poupart’s ligament, may' now be observed, by placing the body' and thigh in different atti- tudes ; and the direction in which the necessary' pressure must be applied during the taxis, may' also be understood from a consideration of the course of the canal. The anatomy of crural or femoral hernia may' now be examined, and if possible a female subject should be chosen for the dissection. If a different body' is selected from that on which the inguinal canal has been laid open, incisions similar to those recommended for the display' of the latter (p. 497) should be made; the skin should then be removed from the upper and fore part of the thigh, five or six inches below Pou- part’s ligament; and to permit of this an incision of six inches in length should be made down the front of the limb from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and another from the tuberosity' of the pubes along the inner margin, as low as it is wished to remove the skin; the subcutaneous cellular membrane will then be displayed, and may be perceived to be a continuation of the superficial fascia already described. The superficial epigastric vein may now be traced lower; other small veins will be observed in this membrane, and if the subject be minutely injected, the corresponding arteries may also be remarked. The fascia should next be dissected downwards, as the skin has been, and the aponeurosis (fascia lata) displayed. In this part of the dissection the different small vessels, already' remark- ed, must be divided, and when the membrane is raised numerous

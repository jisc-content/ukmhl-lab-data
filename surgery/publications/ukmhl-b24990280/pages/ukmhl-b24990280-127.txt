109 ANEURISM. eligible situations there need be no hesitation in giving it a trial, although it would be wrong to be sanguine 'as to the favourable issue. It may be applied over the tumour, on the artery leading to the disease, or partly on both. I know of no other remedy on which the smallest reliance should be placed: the different proposals of causing coagulation, or deposits of fibrin, by means of cold, passing threads through the tumour, or heated wires into it, and by other methods, are all in my opinion of the most futile character; and the trials that have been made of them on the living body, should be considered valuable, chiefly on account of the assurance which they have given, that their success has not been such as to encourage repetition. Success, in a single instance, with one or other of such plans, may possibly occur; but I should deem it unjustifiable, in most examples, to tamper, either with the disease or the patient’s credulity, in persisting in their use, or even applying them at all. In internal aneurisms which are beyond the reach of surgical art, there is, of course, every propriety in resorting to a trial of one or all of those methods, which have been proposed for the purpose of en- couraging a spontaneous cure ; but as it is not my present object to speak particularly of what is usually termed the medical treatment, I need not refer to such modes of practice, further than to add the testimony of my own limited experience to the vast amount of evi- dence already obtained, that, however laudable it may be to resort to such treatment in cases which are so fatal in their character, we possess no remedy which seems to have the smallest specific influence on the disease ; at all events such an influence as to lead to a certain cure. In the practice of surgery, the application of a ligature to the vessel with which the disease is connected, has a powerful and specific effect; and although the operation for its accomplishment is not without danger, both at the time and subsequently, it possesses such advantages over all other modes of practice, that the surgeon who, when other circumstances are favourable, hesitates to adopt or recommend it, may with justice have either his skill or his sincerity called in question. The immediate effect of a ligature is to check the flow of blood through the disease, either entirely, or to such an extent as shall per- mit the contents of the sac to consolidate, by impeding the influence of the heart’s action. In aneurisms at certain parts of the body, it cannot be doubted that after the main vessel has been obstructed by opera- tion, circulation still goes on, though with diminished force and quan- tity. Sometimes this is quite appreciable ; as, for example, in the popliteal artery, where pulsation often can be felt after obstruction of the femoral; the same has occurred, too, in an inguinal aneurism after ligature of the external iliac ; at other times the surgeon cannot feel pulsation, although a very considerable current of blood may be passing along, as is proved by what sometimes happens after ligature of the subclavian artery for wounds and aneurisms of the axillary. A case will be referred to afterwards where such an operation failed,—bleed- ing continued; a similar case has lately been described in The Lancet,—

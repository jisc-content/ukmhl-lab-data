382 THE HEAD AND NECK. Fig. 195. the knife should be applied very cautiously, and not before the parts have been examined with the eye and point of the finger ; the handle of the instrument, or a silver blade, may be called into requisition; for, besides the danger of coming in contact with the artery or vein, there is the risk of wounding some of their branches. If, after a careful division of the textures supposed to lie over the artery, the vessel is not yet exposed, the anterior scalenus muscle should be looked for, and to facilitate this step a few of the fibres of the stemo-mastoid may, if required, be divided,â€”indeed, whenever this muscle takes a broad attachment to the clavicle, there should be no hesitation about this proceeding, and thus the scalenus will be rea- dily exposed by separating with the handle of the knife the cellular tissue immediately over it. The fore-finger should now be run down to -the attachment of this muscle to the first rib, and immediately out- side and a little behind this point the artery may be felt pulsating: a slight and cautious dissection will now expose a small portion of the vessel; and, when its identity has been ascertained, the point of the aneurism needle should be carried under it, from before backwards, and thus the ligature may be conveyed .around it. On the living body when the needle is under the artery, or before the noose is drawn, the vessel may be slightly elevated and compressed with the point of the finger, and by watching the effects of this manoeuvre on the pulse at the wrist and on the aneurismal tumour, if one be pre- sent, all further doubts (if any still remain) about the vessel, will be set at rest. The ligature may now be tightened; one or both ends should be allowed to hang out of the wound, the edges of which, on

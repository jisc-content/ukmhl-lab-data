416 THE HEAD AND NECK. or rather from this last incision, the knife should he carried obliquely down to the lower margin of the jaw, about midway between its angle and the chin: then a cut should extend, from opposite the upper end of the one last made, as far up as the outer extremity of the inci- sion already over the eyebrow, to the upper margin of the malar bone : a semicircular incision should next be made along the lower eyelid, about an inch from its margin, from that over the malar up to the division in the forehead at the root of the nose. The orbicular muscles of the mouth and eyelid may now be displayed,—the depressor and levator anguli oris, the zygomatici, the depressor labii inferioris, the levator labii superioris, and the smaller muscles connected with the lips and nose may all be displayed by elevating the flaps marked out by the incisions recommended; but I must refer the student to a work on anatomy, if he wishes to examine them particularly. Wherever the knife passes in the face, it will divide some twig of the portio dura; but this can scarcely be avoided unless the dissection be solely for the purpose of exposing the branches of that nerve. In the hollow of the cheek, or rather where it is now pressed outwards, the facial artery will be observed passing obliquely upwards to the root of the nose, and the corresponding vein will be noticed a quarter of an inch or more behind and above it: here, too, a pellet of fat will be found between the anterior margin of the masseter and the buccinator, and, in removing it so as to expose the latter muscle, the anterior ex- tremity of the parotid duct (Steno’s) will be brought into view. The latter may now be traced back to the gland, and the masseter may be exposed at the same time: some of the branches of the portio dura may be readily preserved in this part of the dissection, and (particu- larly if an injection has been used) some branches of the external carotid (the transverse facial) may also be displayed: these may be traced through the substance of the parotid, — the arteries to the main trunk, and the nerves to the portio dura itself, where it has already been displayed in the dissection of the neck. The facial artery may now be traced throughout its whole course from the mar- gin of the jaw (where it has been previously exposed, p. 377) as far as the inner commissure of the eyelids, and the branches most worthy of notice are those proceeding to the lips : if these are followed whilst the lips are closed, it will be necessary to remove the orbicular muscle ; but it will be better to open the mouth and examine their position by dividing the mucous membrane, and it should be noticed that they lie close upon it. Tile supra-orbital, infra-orbital, and mental foramina should now be exposed, with the branches of the fifth pair passing through them, and the further examination of the face may be delayed for the present. The aponeurosis over the temporal muscle may next be cleared, and then it may be detached from its connexions above, when the course of the muscle can be traced as far as the zygomatic arch. The calvarium should next be removed by carrying a saw through the bones a little above the occipital protuberance, cars, and supra-

THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 332 other means for checking inflammation, it happens much more fre- quently, that treatment similar to that required for abscess is posi- tively necessary, and I shall therefore now refer the reader to the chapters on abscess and sinus in the introductory part of the volume, where he will be at no loss to find the practice which may be recom- mended in such cases. Occasionally sarcomatous tumours form over the ligament of the patella. I have seen and removed examples of the kind. In all such a section has presented a hard fibrous aspect. Sometimes such growths have been developed in one side of the bursa,â€”being merely, as it were, an increase in thickness; but in most the tumour has been separated. Those which I have interfered with have been about the size of a walnut or billiard ball, and from their size have caused annoyance. Excision of portions of bones may often be practised with great advantage in the lower extremity, whether for caries, necrosis, or ex- posure resulting from dislocations or fractures. When there is caries in the toes or metatarsus, there need be no hesitation about the propriety of amputation: in the first place, supposing the point of the toe to be sound, if the part behind is re- moved, the remaining portion, being deprived of support, will probably be useless; and in the instance of the metatarsal bones being affected the result will be the same. The best exemplification of this remark will be to take the cases of disease of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The condition of the foot represented by this sketch (fig. 178), Fig. 178. is by no means uncommon : the extent of enlargement often excites suspicion, with the inexperienced, that the disease is more extensive than it is in reality. Among numerous instances of the kind which

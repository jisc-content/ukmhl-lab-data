•2!) FOR SUPPRESSING HEMORRHAGE. Fig. 30. aneurism, when the main artery is cut down upon at a distance from the disease, an instrument of this kind is generally used,—the com- mon aneurism needle (fig 30), as here represented. Various sorts and shapes are recommended by different surgeons; but one like the sketch will be found most con- venient for general purposes. The metal should not bend nor break with moderate force, and the eye should be near the point, which should not be so sharp as to en- danger either artery or vein. The handle should resemble that of a common scalpel. When a ligature is applied to an artery, the nearer it is placed to the neighbouring textures, so much the better; great care should be taken, however, that none of these are included, particularly the veins and nerves ; and, in opera- tions for aneurism, the less an artery is disturbed in passing the needle and thread under it, so much the more favourable opportu- nity is supposed to be given for its permanent closure. In some rare and troublesome cases of bleeding, when the vessel or vessels cannot be got hold of with the forceps, it is necessary in order to arrest the flow of blood, to pass a needle and thread through the textures on each side, so as to include some of the surrounding parts in the noose. Common surgical needles, such as are here represented (fig. 31), may be used for this Fig. 31.

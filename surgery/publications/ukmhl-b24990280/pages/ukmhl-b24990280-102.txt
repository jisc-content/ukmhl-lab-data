84 GANGRENE AND MORTIFICATION. greatly inclined to wait for a line of demarcation; and, that even here, I should not be very sanguine as to the result. Numerous cases might be brought forward, however, to prove the success of such prac- tice, yet I believe that, in many instances, the surgeon will best show his judgment, by amputating, in severe injuries, before sufficient time has elapsed for gangrene to come on, or by waiting, in the event of such an occurrence, until it is seen how far, and to what degree, the affection is likely to proceed, and in addition, to what extent the consti- tution sympathises with the local disease. The latter circumstance is, indeed, often remarkable ; but whether it is from the wound or the gangrene, it is difficult to say. I once saw an amputation in the leg performed by a surgeon of great experience, for a severe compound fracture : the calf of the leg, when the incisions were made, was in a slightly suspicious condition, but not sufficient to deter from select- ing this part for the operation: unequivocal gangrene, however, attacked the stump, and within eight-and-forty hours amputation was performed in the thigh: again the disease appeared in the stump, and at the same time in the skin over one of the scapula;, where there was no suspicion even, that the slightest injury had been inflicted. Although I am satisfied that the operator did what the best rules of surgery dictated in this case, it is nevertheless exceedingly probable, that if delay had been given, in hopes of a line of demarcation form- ing, the condition of the shoulder would have been sufficient to have deterred from an operation at all. It will often happen, both in spreading gangrene and in mortifica- tion, that the surgeon does not feel warranted in resorting to am- putation ; yet, such is the tenacity of life in some individuals in the latter affection, that a large portion of an extremity may be converted, after the lapse of weeks or months, into a shrivelled, dry, and black mass, attached to the body only by means of bone, which undergoes disjunctive absorption more slowly than the soft textures. In such a case it will be but charity to assist nature with the saw, by applying it close to the living part, where, if no dead bone be left, granulations will spring up, and a tolerable, nay often an excellent, stump will be the result. It may sometimes be a question in such cases, whether it will be best to cut in the line of demarcation, or perform a regular amputation a little higher up: the latter should certainly be preferred in some instances, although, as a general rule, particularly in those advanced in life and of debilitated constitution, I believe it will be best to follow the indications of nature, and confine the manipulations to the parts where separation is already in progress.

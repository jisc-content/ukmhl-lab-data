557 SOUNDING FOR STONE. or the other, raises the pelvis above the level of the shoulders, or stands erect, the search may be more successful. In one instance, a common catheter will be as efficient as any other instrument; when, however, there may be doubt as to the metal having touched a stone or merely a hard surface within the bladder, the solid steel should be preferred. Of late years it has been a prevailing custom to use a sound similar in shape, near the point, to the lithotrite exhibited in one of the future figures, under the supposition that the short part beyond the curve can be turned down behind the prostate gland, and that the interior of the bladder can thus be more thoroughly examined: with this shape, or with a large curve, it will sometimes be of advantage to raise the lower part of the bladder by introducing the forefinger into the rec- tum. In one example the stone can be touched most readily when the bladder is moderately distended with urine; in another, when it is almost empty: on one occasion, in the same individual the object may be most palpable, at another time, the utmost tact cannot detect it— and the latter will be observed, too, in instances where there is after- wards every proof that the stone has not in the interval passed into any pouch connected with the bladder: indeed, this condition is exceedingly rare — I mean that of a large pouch sufficient to conceal a calculus of ordinary dimensions. On all occasions a small stone, as might be anticipated, is more difficult to detect than a large one, and in general, when one of moderate diameter (eight or twelve lines) is pre- sent, it is felt almost as soon as the instrument enters the bladder; for although a calculus may for a time lodge in any part of the organ, its most frequent seat is so immediately in contact with the orifice of the urethra, that it is often struck ere the curve of the sound has pass- ed the prostate. It need scarcely be added, that all the movements with the sound must be made in the gentlest manner possible: on one occasion a slight rotatory motion with the hand will suffice, on another the whole instrument must be carried inwards so as to tap the stone, and again, it may probably be necessary to draw it backwards in such a manner as to cause the concavity between the curve and point to touch the neck of the bladder on all sides of the urethral orifice. Although it has been recommended that the sound should be in- troduced as for catheterism, it will be found inconvenient to use the right hand when the outer end of the instrument is between the pa- tient’s thighs: the left may therefore be used at this time; but as few possess the same delicacy of touch with the latter organ, the surgeon may, after having reached the bladder, place himself between the patient’s thighs or stand upon his right side. For my own part, I generally introduce the sound with my left hand, while standing by the patient's right side, and then, when any minute search is required, I seize the instrument with my right hand. In the event of a stone being detected, the treatment may next be taken into consideration. Supposing that all those internal, or, as they may be called, constitutional means, which a knowledge of the

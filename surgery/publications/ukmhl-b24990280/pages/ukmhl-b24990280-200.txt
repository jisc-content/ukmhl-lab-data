THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 182 the anatomical neck, as it is called,â€”the treatment should be the same. The lower fragment should be sufficiently drawn down, the upper kept in its natural place by a small pad in the axilla, a pasteboard splint, about two and a half inches broad, and long enough to reach from the elbow to the acromion, should be laid on the outside of the arm, and both should be retained by means of a roller, which should be first carried round the limb and then round the chest, as represented below, in figure 90. The bandage round the chest keeps the parts stead}- by fixing the shoulder, and the pad in the axilla an- swers the double purpose of preventing displacement of either fragment inwards; for if the fissure is above the insertions of the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis muscle the lower fragment may be drawn towards the side by their action, and if below their insertion, the upper fragment may be drawn in a similar manner by the same influence. There is great trouble in re- taining a bandage round the chest in a proper position for any considerable length of time, such as may be required in the instance of fracture at present under con-

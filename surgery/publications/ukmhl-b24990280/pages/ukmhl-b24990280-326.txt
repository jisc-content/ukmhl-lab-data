THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 308 wanting altogether: neither a bleeding wound nor an aneurism on the dorsum of the foot, though the vessel can actually be felt pul- tating in front of the ankle, will with certainty denote its presence in the usual situation higher up; for, when it is deficient in size or ab- sent, there is commonly a large branch of the fibular passing through the interosseous ligament, a little above the ankle, to the fore part of the leg, which occupies the site of the anterior tibial on the foot. The circumstances which may demand ligature of the posterior sibial artery will be similar to those requiring deligation of the ante- rior, and the remarks in reference to the rules of practice are equally applicable. If the surgeon has a choice of situation, he ought un- doubtedly to select that part of the vessel where it lies between the malleolus and calcaneum. An incision, two inches in length, should be made midway between this process and"the insertion of the tendo Achillis: after the skin has been divided, some strong aponeurotic fibres must next be cut in the same manner, and the artery will be found immediately beneath, accompanied by two veins, with the poste- rior tibial nerve between it and the os calcis. Perhaps, however, the vessel must be sought for higher up, and four inches above the ankle an incision may be made through the skin about three inches in length, and about half an inch posterior to the margin of the tibia. The knife should next be carried through the aponeurosis; for, in this situation, both the superficial and deep layers, if they are not actually, arc so nearly, in contact, that they may be considered as one, when the artery will be found on the flexor communis and tibialis por-

The sketch on the preceding page (fig. 163) gives a fair illustration of the most conspicuous appearances; the aspect of age, compared with that at p. 267, of a figure with dis- location on the dorsum ilii, at once points out one of the most dis- tinctive features between them ; and a slight study of each figure, with the symptoms peculiar to each, will show how wide the diifer- Fig. 164. ences arc.

The treatment of this kind of fracture may be conducted with the thigh bent at the hip, or in a straight position ; the latter plan seems most in repute, and, as in fractures in other parts of the limb, I gene- rally give it the preference. The splint, bandages, and manner of setting the limb, are all such as have been described and exhibited at p. 295, in treating of fractures of the bone lower down.

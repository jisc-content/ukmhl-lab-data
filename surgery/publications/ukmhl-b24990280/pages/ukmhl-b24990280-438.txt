420 THE HEAD AND NECK. superior maxillary, the latter of which should he traced between the pterygoids, where it lies behind the neck of the bone, and forwards also until it gets into the pterygo-maxillary fossa. In clearing these vessels behind the ascending ramus of the jaw, several branches, sometimes of considerable size, (transverse facial,) may be noticed, some passing across the masseter, others into its substance ; an as- cending branch of the portio dura will also be found in the parotid, and now it may be observed how deep this gland penetrates, and how it fills up the space between the jaw and the mastoid pro- cess. The external lateral ligament, between the root of the zy- goma and the condyle of the jaw, may next be examined; then it should be divided, as also the synovial capsule, and thus the in- terior of the articulations will be exposed: the two compartments formed by the inter-articular cartilage will be observed, and now it may be well to move the condyle as when the mouth is opened and closed: next the knife should be carried round the head of the bone, so as to disarticulate it, a proceeding which will be greatly facilitated by beginning from below, first dividing the internal pterygoid, then the external, and, lastly, the internal lateral ligament, and any part of the synovial capsule which may impede the removal of the condyle. In thus detaching the bones the positions of the upper part of the carotid and its two chief branches will be brought into view more fully than ever ; but it may be observed that the separation can be effected without interfering with any of them,â€”a circumstance to be referred to afterwards in describing excision of this part of the bone on the living body. Now the palate and throat may be examined: the part shoidd be sponged out, and then the finger should be passed from the mouth into the pharynx: its point should be hooked up over the soft palate into the nostrils, then placed against the tonsils, and carried all round the surface, as also upon the upper aspect of the epiglottis. These parts, as far as can be permitted in their present condition, should then be looked at; next the side of the pharynx should be slit open, by dividing any portion of the buccinator muscle which may be left entire, the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and the constrictors, when a more complete examination can be effected. The anterior and pos- terior pillars of the fauces and the tonsil between them may now be seen on the side which has not been cut: the posterior openings of the nostrils, the pharyngeal extremity of the Eustachian tube, the upper orifice of the larynx, and that leading into the oesophagus, may also be perceived: and now, to complete the proceedings, an elastic bougie may be passed through one nostril into the pharynx, then it may be passed into the widest part of the Eustachian tube; then hooked forward into the mouth, then again passed into the pharynx, from whence it may be pushed into the larynx, and lastly into the oeso- phagus: it is well to exercise these manoeuvres, so as to be able to appreciate similar movements on the living subject. The further in- vestigation of the oesophagus and larynx has already been described

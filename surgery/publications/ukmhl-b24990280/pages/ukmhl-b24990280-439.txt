421 DISSECTION OF HEAD, FACE, AND THROAT. at p. 378, and the only other point of much surgical interest in this situation which in the present style of dissection deserves especial notice, is the relation of the internal carotid to the pharynx, particularly the outer part of the tonsil: this may he understood by an examination either on the side already laid open, or the opposite one, when the vessel may be observed passing at such a distance from the amygdala as to be quite free of the gland, and not at all firmly connected either with it or with the pharynx. The posterior surface of the superior maxilla may now be cleared, and the finger should be carefully carried over it, so that the natural shape of this part may be fully appreciated by such a mode of examination : then a punch should be thrust into the antrum, immediately above the fangs of the anterior molar tooth; next the latter should be drawn, and the instrument again thrust into the cavity of the socket, when a part of the bone between the malar and the alveoli (canine fossa) should be scooped out with a gouge or cut away with forceps, and so the cavity in the superior maxilla will be laid open. The proximity of the fangs of the teeth to the interior, the thickness of the shell of bone, and the opening into the nostril at the inner side, should all be duly taken notice of. Next the saw should be carried from the frontal bone down through the hard palate, a little to one side of the mesial line, when the interior of the nostril may be exposed; but the parts cannot be separated unless the occipital bone be cut also, or a transverse division be made in its basilar process, â€” the latter, perhaps, being the best plan, as the foramen magnum and upper part of the spine can thus be left entire for future dissection. '1 he course and level of the floor of the nostril should now be no- ticed, the fossa between it and the inferior turbinated bone should be looked to, and here the lower opening of the nasal duct, just within or covered by the anterior point of the last-named bone, may now be displayed: the fossa above the bone should then be examined, and here the opening from the antrum may be perceived : the middle and superior turbinated bones (portions of the cribriform) may next be touched with the points of the forceps or the forefinger, when a little pressure will evince how very fragile they are, and how easily they may be broken with the application of but a slight force. The saw may now be applied to the lowermost cervical vertebra1: the spinal canal may be laid open between the division and the occiput, by removing the laminae of the vertebra, and the back part of the occipital bone may also be di sided so as to permit the removal of the posterior half of the foramen magnum; and, lastly, the ligaments of the column in this region may be examined, care being taken to observe the singularly beautiful mechanism between the atlas, axis, and occipital bone: the manner in which the odontoid process is held in its position by the transverse (cruciform) and odontoid ligaments is especially worthy of notice, but I must refer the dissector to an anatomical work for a description of these structures.

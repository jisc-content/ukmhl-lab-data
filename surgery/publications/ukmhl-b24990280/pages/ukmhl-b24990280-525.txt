507 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. Next the attachment of the peritoneum to the bladder should be more carefully examined than previously, also the entrance of the ureters, the whole circumference of the prostate, and the vcsicula seminalis with the vas deferens on each side. An opening (with scissors) should then be made in the anterior part of the bladder, and the interior should be surveyed, with reference to the entrance of the ureters, the projection (if there be any) of the third lobe of the pros- tate, and especially the orifice of the urethra, which latter may be per- ceived to be a little above the lower end of the viscus. The scissors may now be carried through the neck of the bladder, the upper part of the prostate, and along the membranous portion of the urethra, and through the middle of the corpus cavemosum, so as to lay open the canal throughout its entire course. The apertures of the mucous and other ducts may next be examined; but in such an investigation, a work containing the descriptive anatomy of these parts should be con- sulted, and therefore I will not dwell longer upon them. The ligaments of the pelvis may next attract attention. Those be- tween the sacrum and innominatum require no particular mention here; but the main strength of the articulation may be observed to consist in the close junction of the two bones by intervening cartilage; which is firm in itself, and firmly attached to both. The articulation is very frequently anchylosed in old persons. The sacro-sciatic liga- ments and the obturator need no special notice either, and those of Poupart and of Gimbernat, as also the triangular one between the rami of the pubes, have already been referred to.

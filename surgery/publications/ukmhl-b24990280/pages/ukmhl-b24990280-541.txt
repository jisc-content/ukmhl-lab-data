HERNIA. OPERATIONS. 5-23 case an incision of this kind , of this , or of this A , (I generally prefer the last,) will be better: two or three flaps can thus be raised, and the parts can then be more clearly distinguished. After the integuments have been dissected from the tumour, it is not necessary to clear away each succeeding layer in the same manner,—a single line of division being all that is required. The dissection must be conducted much in the same manner as is described in the operation for inguinal hernia: whatever is the thick- ness of the coverings, they must all be divided : and when the sac is opened, the finger must be pushed up towards the seat of stricture; a probe-pointed bistoury must then be passed a little higher than this part, and its edge being turned against the stricture, an incision about one-fourth of an inch will in general suffice to permit the reduc- tion to be accomplished. With regard to the seat of stricture in this kind of hernia, it will almost invariably be found in the crural ring itself. It is customary for some surgeons to speak of Gimbernat’s ligament as being the seat of stricture; but, in my opinion, it is not more so than any other part of the ring; and the idea is quite erroneous, that because this structure happens to be cut to permit the protrusion to be reduced, it has been the sole cause of the stricture. I think there can be little doubt as to the propriety of dividing this ligament to the extent already mention- ed, and the reasons may be stated in a few words: the knife cannot be carried outwards without endangering the common femoral vein, and it cannot be conveniently passed behind the protrusion, so as to open the back part of the ring, nor if it were so could any texture be divided likely to relieve the tightness ; if it be carried in front, Pou- part’s ligament may be cut with facility ; but the parts will be thus rendered so weak that a protrusion may afterwards happen in the cicatrix; there is thus then only another side of the ring left, and that is formed by Gimbernat’s ligament, which seems to me by far the most eligible part for the enlargement. When the aperture is thus cut its diameter is increased, and the stricture is consequently removed. In some instances the stricture may be relieved by dividing the upper horn of the crescentic margin of the fascia lata where it is attached to Poupart’s ligament; it does not follow, however, that this part has consequently been the cause of constriction, for the effect of the incision has been to enlarge the ring, and thus to relax the real seat of stricture; nor do I suppose that the plan would answer in any in- stance where the latter is very tight: on some occasions, after hav-

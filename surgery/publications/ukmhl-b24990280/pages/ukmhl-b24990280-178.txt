160 THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. an injury being complicated with fracture of the radius, lower down, so as to permit the lower fragment with the ulna passing upwards ; and here, too, I imagine that the coronoid process of the ulna might be broken off. Should any of these cases be such as to admit of remedy without amputation (and that such do occur there can be no doubt), there may or there may not be difficulty in replacing the bones; and here, as in all other injuries of this joint, whether the attempt at reduction is successful or not, too much care cannot be bestowed in keeping the limb quiet, and in a bent position. At first, as the patient will be kept to his bed, the arm may be placed on a cushion, and afterwards it should be carried in a sling. In certain compound dislocations of the elbow, when complicated with fractures of the coronoid or olecranon process, or of the con- dyles of the humerus, and in which, were the ends replaced, there might be every reason to apprehend severe inflammation, which might probably end in caries of the bones ; were the case one, in short, where at the first glance amputation might be deemed the only re- source, it may be well to pause and contemplate the propriety of cutting away the exposed and injured ends of the bones, and thus give the patient a chance of having his hand preserved. There can be no doubt, that in many instances such practice would be better than amputation ; but in such as is represented in this drawing (70), (taken from an arm which I amputated some time ago in Kingâ€™s Col- lege Hospital,) the soft parts seemed too much injured to encourage me to cherish a hope of saving the limb by such a proceeding as that re- ferred to. The particulars of this case, and my reasons for preferring amputation, were given in the Lancet, October 2nd, 1841: but as- suredly in less severe injuries it would be proper to try the chance of saving the limb, without or with excision, as might be deemed most advisable.

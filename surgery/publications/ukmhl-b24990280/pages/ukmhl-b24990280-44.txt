26 MEANS AND INSTRUMENTS instances where a wound is dressed with a view to union by the first intention, this plan is preferable to that of cutting away both ends of the ligature, close by the knot; and so far as my experience goes, I would rather even leave both ends, so that as we remove them when free from the artery, the noose may be drawn out at the same time, than leave the noose to find its own way to the surface,â€”a process Fig. 27. which is sometimes both tedious and troublesome, as well as the source of much anxiety and pain to the patient. Taking into consi- deration the injury inflicted, and the extent of wound when a ligature is required, I deem the presence of one, or even both of its ends, a matter of little additional consequence. I have on many occasions left both ends of a ligature on the main artery, hanging out of the wound (as in the operation for aneurism), without having had cause to regret doing so, and in instances where numerous ligatures have been applied, have had more trouble with some small part of the wound (perhaps the aperture of a stitch) than with the tracks of all the ligatures used. When a wound is expected to heal by granu- lation, both ends may be cut away; but even here, though I in general practise the plan, much annoyance may be caused by the noose remaining imbedded in the granulations. The ligature which I generally make use of is small, smooth, and well-spun twine, which as it comes from the shops, is sufficiently stiff, without the aid of bees-wax, to permit a noose to be cast without trouble from the ends being too limber. Silk may be used, but it should not be supposed that the finer material produces less irritation in the wound ; indeed I think that some practical surgeons have been far too nice on some points regarding the size and material of liga- tures. In my own practice I am in the habit of using a greater number of ligatures than I know to be the custom of other surgeons, often preferring the thread to the chance of the vessel closing natu- rally, and I feel bound to say, that on no single occasion have I ever had reason to suppose, that any subsequent unpleasant occurrence has been in any way attributable either to the size or number of ligatures. I do not wisli it to be imagined, however, that I am an advocate for thick.ligatures, or for using more than may be reasonably deemed

THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 344 perhaps, from the anterior tibia), or the extremity of the plantar arch, and after having in my own cases fruitlessly endeavoured to get a noose cast round the bleeding point, I have been obliged to resort to pressure, which on these occasions has never been found to fail. In such instances a little pellet of lint has been placed on the bleeding point, then a larger, until the wound has been partially filled, when I have compressed the whole with a bandage applied moderately tight round the foot. Occasionally in scrofulous subjects the foot has the appearance re- presented in this drawing (fig. 180). In this instance the swelling was Fig. 160. so great on the inner margin that it was doubtful if any partial amputa- tion, unless it were Chopartâ€™s, would be of any avail; I determined, however, to be guided by what appeared during an attempt to save the outer side of the foot by a longitudinal operation. Being convinced that the internal cuneiform, and probably the scaphoid bone also, was diseased, as well as that which supported the great toe, the external in- cision was made further back than for the operation last described: after separating the latter bone and the internal cuneiform, it was found necessary to scoop away a small part of the middle cuneiform, and also a portion of the second metatarsal bone, but thus the rest of the foot was preserved. I have lately had the satisfaction of learning that this patient has now, after the lapse of two years, an excellent use of the foot, which presents the appearance exhibited in figure 181. The concave shape of the inner margin of the foot will be noticed, and the manner in which the second toe (now the first) is curved inwards is remarkable. Had this kind of distortion proceeded further, the foot might have resembled the condition referred to at page 333, in which it became so much twisted inwards, with the sole upwards, as to resemble a club-foot when the person walks on its outer margin.

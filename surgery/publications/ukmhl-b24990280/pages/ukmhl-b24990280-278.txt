2G0 Fie,. 133. THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. Fig. 139. stated that “ when this accident is accompanied, as it sometimes is, with a wound of the integuments of the inner ankle, and that made by the protrusion of the bone, it not unfrequently ends in a fatal gan- grene, unless prevented by timely amputation, though,” he adds, “ I have several times seen it do very well without.” In severe injuries of the ankle, the fibula has been separated from the tibia, but the accompanying fractures and dislocations have always formed the most conspicuous and serious features of each case. The upper extremity of the fibula has occasionally been separated from the tibia, but the accident is so rare, and being at the same time in all likelihood accompanied with fracture, that no separate comment upon it is here required. The bones of the knee-joint may be displaced, in almost any direc- tion. The patella will be drawn upwards, in the event of the acci- dental division or rupture of its ligament; and when the tibia and femur are thrown out of their natural position, this bone will also be more or less displaced. In some individuals, a very trifling force will cause the patella to slip in front of either condyle of the femur, parti- cularly when the limb is in a horizontal position, with the muscles on the fore part of the thigh in a relaxed state ; I have known displace- ment occasioned, under these circumstances, by a child resting its foot on a person’s knee, in stepping across to get out of bed. The drawings (figs. 13d and 139) exhibit the lateral displacements above

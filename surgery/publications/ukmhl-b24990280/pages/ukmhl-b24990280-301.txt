203 FRACTURES OF THE LEG. attached that in the event of the foot being raised or depressed, it will always rest flatwise on the mattress, or a board placed at the foot of the bed, for the purpose of supporting it. In treating a fracture of the leg with this apparatus, the patient must be kept in bed for three or four weeks at least, however favourably union may seem to go on, and due regard should therefore be paid to his comfort during this irksome confinement. With a down or feather bed it will be almost impossible to keep the limb and body in a satisfactory position, and a hair mattress will be found best suited to the object in view. Previous to placing the limb on the splint, the latter should be covered on its upper surface with a folded towel, of a corresponding breadth, which should extend from the point of the foot-board to the extremity of the thigh-piece : a thin wool or hair cushion may be used instead; the object of either being to protect the skin from fret- ting. The limb, slightly bent at the knee, may now be placed on the splint, with the ham resting opposite to the junction of the leg and thigh plates, care being taken to apply such a degree of extending force as shall bring the fragments into the most favourable position : these things being done, the foot-board should next be placed against the sole, and fastened at the most convenient angle ; a calico bandage should then be applied so as to fix the foot, leg, and thigh, to the whole apparatus ; and in doing this it may be necessary to stuff in little pads of tow, lint, cushions of hair, or folds of cloth, between the towel and the splint, or to place some of these in front of the leg, to facilitate the proper adjustment of the fragments. If the pads and cushions can be dispensed with, the handiwork will always look neater, and possibly, too, the surgeon will have less trouble in the re-adjustments, which their presence will almost always render frequently necessary: in many instances, however, they seem absolutely required, not only to assist in keeping the fragments in proper apposition, but also to prevent partial pressure, either from the weight of the limb, or the tightness of the bandages. In some examples it is desirable to leave that part of the skin over the injury uncovered for a time, probably eight or ten days; and in all cases of compound fracture, where suppuration may be expected, this is clearly requisite; indeed, in many examples the surgeon must be guided more by peculiar circumstances which may require corre- sponding treatment, than by any general rules which can be set down in such a work as this. By comparing the limb with its sound neighbour, a tolerably cor- rect idea may be formed as to its shape ; and, when once all the parts are properly adjusted, it rarely happens that much future trouble is experienced : on this score, however, much will depend on the nature of the fracture, the patientâ€™s condition and constitution, as well as upon those exigencies and casualties to which every one is at all times more or less exposed, and which, one and all, may serve to make the treatment difficult, to retard it, or even to set at nought the best efforts of the surgeon.

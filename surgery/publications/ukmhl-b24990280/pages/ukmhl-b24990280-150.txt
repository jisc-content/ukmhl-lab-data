AMPUTATION. 132 retracted integuments, and passed half an inch or more through aponeu- rosis and superficial muscular fibres ; now the assistant should place his fingers and thumbs deeper in the wound, and apply more force, so as to retract both skin and the parts last divided ; for the third time, the instrument should encircle the limb, so as to divide every texture down to the hone; here the retractor should be put on in such a way as to cover the greater part of the wound, and then drawn forcibly upwards: it may be pulled an inch or more above the part where the knife has first touched the periosteum, when muscular fibres will appear in the centre, still adhering to the bone ; these must be divided close up to the cloth, either with another circular sweep, or by applying the point of the knife ; and if on the application of a little more retrac- tile force, any additional fibres appear, they must also be divided in the same way, and then the saw must be applied at the highest part where the bone is exposed. A variety of circumstances may influence the extent and facility of retraction ; but to preserve a sufficient covering by the operation just described, I consider it always requisite to apply a good deal of force, —certainly much more than is required for the retraction of flaps. Sometimes the fingers alone will suffice, but in general the retractor will be found more efficient. By the operation as thus described, there will be a sloping surface, from the edge of the skin up to the bone ; the wound will represent a “ conical cavity,” as described by Alanson, and, provided the re- traction has been sufficient, a “ fleshy ” stump will be formed. I do not deem it at all necessary to place the knife obliquely, nor to use it in the manner described by the celebrated authority last named. The cutting instrument may, in all the circular incisions, be held at right angles with the bone, and the retraction, first with the fingers and then with the linen band, seems to me to obviate the stumbling-block which commentators on Alanson’s operation have always brought for- ward against the plan proposed by him. It is evident that Alanson could not have applied the saw at the apex of the cone without draw- ing the parts upwards ; he must have done so, although he does not clearly state the circumstance, and it is somewhat singular that even in the second edition of his work, when he adverts to the misunder- standing that had arisen about his operation, he should not have pointed out that the “ conical cavity” was not made from hard incom- pressible materials, but from those of a soft flexible nature, such as could be caused by pressure to assume almost any form or shape for the time being. Perhaps he did not think it requisite to notice such an apparent circumstance ; but I cannot divest myself of the idea that some have supposed, that in order to form the cone, a kind of process is required, such as might be necessary to make a similar figure in a bit of wood, or other equally incompressible substance. By the forci- ble retraction, the length of the cone is made scarcely appreciable; but as soon as the pressure is taken off, it becomes apparent. I am convinced that if the circular incision is made through skin,

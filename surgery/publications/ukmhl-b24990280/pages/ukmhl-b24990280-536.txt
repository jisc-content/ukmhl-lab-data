The two hands and the bistoury are here represented in the usual attitude Fig. 224. on these occasions. The edge of the knife may be supposed to have been turned towards the stricture, and it will be evident that its point may be raised cither with the right hand, or with the forefinger of the left. It has been the custom of some teachers to recommend that the point of the bistoury should always be kept close upon that of the finger, and that the stricture should be divided by.describing part of a circle with the right hand,â€”a manoeuvre which evidently could not be accomplished in a deep-seated stricture, as it often is, without making a much more extensive wound than the circumstances demand. These instructions will give a general idea of the style and nature of the operation ; but to make the description more useful, it will be necessary to treat at greater length of the various steps, and also to refer to the ordinary appearances presented by each texture as it is exposed and divided. . , . If the hernia be of recent formation, the cellular tissue and fat will differ little in appearance from the ordinary condition in their natural state ; but if the protrusion has been of long standing, in all

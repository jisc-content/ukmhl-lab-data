INSTRUMENTS, DISSECTIONS, 4 some, and others, again, occasionally select a smaller one ; some have the cutting edge more convex, others less so; a few prefer a double edge, and some choose the point on a level with the back of the blade. Each anatomist and surgeon has a taste of his own in these matters, and it is of no great moment which shape or size is selected, provided he who wields the instrument has the skill and dexterity requisite for its proper application. With such an instrument as is here recommended, I have performed most of the capital operations of surgery,â€”from those requiring the most careful dissection, to the most coarse that can be imagined; from cutting on large arteries, for hernia, for lithotomy, for the removal of tumours from important parts, to the extirpation of large growths where extensive and rapid incisions have been resorted to: indeed, in case of necessity, an in- strument of this kind might even be used in amputation of either extremity; but in proper time I shall describe others which are ' better adapted for the peculiarities of each operation. Fig. 2. The scalpel should be held between the thumb and fingers, by the thickest part of the handle, with such a degree of firmness only, that its weight may still be felt. Either of these positions may be re- sorted to, although the first (fig. 2) is usually deemed best for general purposes. The little finger may be placed on the neighbouring parts, Fig. 3. so as to support the hand, and assist in steadying it; but when extensive incisions are required, the instrument should be laid on with the hand unsupported. The other method, exhibited in the second sketch on this page (fig. 3), requires great steadiness natu-

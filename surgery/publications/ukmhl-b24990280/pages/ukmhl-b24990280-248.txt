230 THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. doing this operation have been recorded, not one of which can be clearly understood without a competent anatomical knowledge. The effort of distinguishing the minute differences between any two or three of these plans actually requires as much study (with some at all events) as does the anatomy of the joint itself, whilst the knowledge acquired in the one pursuit is of incalculably less value than the other. Few surgeons, in the course of extensive practice, meet with many occasions for the performance of this operation; but, on the other hand, the necessity for an acquaintance with the physical structure of the shoulder, is, in a manner, paramount. I do not mean by these remarks to discourage the study of the opinions and proceedings of many who are justly considered our best authorities on such matters : but, as it is not within the compass of this work to describe, or allude to, all that has been said or done in surgery, or to point out the tri- fling shades of difference in the practice of twenty or thirty indi- viduals, — each of whom, be it remarked, is an authority perhaps equal to any other,—I shall rest satisfied with describing two methods which I have myself resorted to on the living body, after having given to most of the others a fair consideration and trial on the subject. If the left arm is to be removed, the patient may be seated, but the position will be better if he is placed on a firm table, with the shoul- der a little elevated and projected beyond its margin. The surgeon, standing on the patient’s left side, should then lay hold of the arm a little above the elbow, and move it from the side and slightly back- wards, so as to give a view of the skin in the axilla. A sharp-pointed amputating knife, seven or eight inches in length, held in the right hand, should then be pushed through the skin in the armpit, imme- diately in front of the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles, and carried upwards and obliquely forwards, until its point protrudes a little in front of the extremity of the acromion : during this movement a good anatomist, with a dexterous hand, may actually open the capsule behind, by adroitly touching the tendons of the teres minor and infra-spinatus; but there is some danger of breaking the point of the instrument against the humerus in this attempt, and the operator may rest contented with cutting as close to the joint as safety in this respect will permit. With whatever object the thrust is in- tended, it will be greatly facilitated by moving the elbow outwards, upwards, and backwards,—indeed, unless this be attended to, there is every chance of the point of the knife appearing through the skin long before it has reached the extremity of the acromion: still keeping the arm in the attitude last mentioned, the knife should be thrust up to its heel, and then carried, with a sawing motion, downwards, back- wards, and outwards, (i. e. towards the surgeon,) so as to make a flap four or five inches in length, formed chiefly of the posterior part of the deltoid with the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, and of the skill behind ; this flap being raised by an assistant, the point of the knife should be used to open completely the posterior and upper part of the joint by a thorough division of the teres minor, infra-spinatus,

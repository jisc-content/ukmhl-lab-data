351 AMPUTATIONS OF THE LEG. Fig. 188. stump be made of such a length only as to fix into the socket, should it he found that the weight of the body cannot be sustained in this way, the projection when the knee is bent will appear so trifling that little objection can be taken to it. When the surgeon has a choice of parts, then, lie should prefer operating about the middle of the leg. A stump of sufficient length for fixing any apparatus will thus be left, whilst at the same time the soft parts bear such proportion to the bones, that an excellent covering to their ends can be provided; whereas, if the incisions are made nearer the ankle this is not so certain. The operation may be conducted in the following manner:â€”A tourniquet being applied at the knee (p. 23), or the vessel commanded here or in the groin (p. 20) with the fingers, the patient being placed on a film table, and properly supported and held by assistants, one of whom should have charge of the part about to be removed, the surgeon should pass an amputating knife, about seven inches long, from one side of the limb to the other, close behind the bones, and cut a flap from the back of the leg, about three or four inches long, in proportion to the bulk of the member ; next he should draw the knife across the fore part of the leg with a semilunar sweep between the points where the knife has transfixed: the large flap behind and the small one in front being drawn up by an assistant, he should then carry the knife round and between the bones, a little higher than the line, of transfixion, and having cleared a space for the saw, that instrument should be applied, and the sepa- ration of the part effected.

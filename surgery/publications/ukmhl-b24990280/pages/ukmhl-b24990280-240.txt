222 THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. Fuj. 122. the incision outwards, this being formed after the end of the bone has been disarticulated. The operation may be done in a manner somewhat similar to that recommended for removal of the fore-finger with a portion of its meta- carpal bone, by detaching the phalanges and distal end of the larger bone, and then continuing to use the point of the knife until the member is separated from the trapezium. Of these two methods, some give the preference to the latter, in which it will be observed there is only a single cicatrix left; whereas in the other there must be one both behind and in front. In all these operations, and in many others, indeed in most, in dif- ferent parts of the body, though the cutting instrument is held in the light hand, the dexterous use of the left will be of infinite service. In amputation of a finger it will (as I have already stated with refer- ence to the phalanges) be advantageous in most cases to wrap a bit of lint round it, so as to enable the surgeon to take a firm hold with the thumb and forefinger of his left hand; when, by turning in a proper direction, he can throw the textures about to be cut so much upon the stretch, that the slightest touch of the knife will divide them ; and in operating at a joint, unless the part intended to be removed be held to one side, it will scarcely be possible to pass a knife across without coming into contact with some point of cartilage or bone. A common scalpel may be used for all the operations above de- scribed ; but I invariably prefer a long, narrow, and somewhat slender bistoury, the blade of which is about three inches in length, and about a quarter in breadth at its widest part. It may be fixed in a common ebony handle, but for convenience I give the preference to the clasp bistoury, which shuts into its handle after the fashion of a

FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 207 within the capsule,) and hence the necessity of forming an accurate diagnosis before the treatment is actually begun. Although age is by no means a certain criterion of judging of the exact position of a fracture, in the upper part of the femur, either within or without the capsular ligament, and though Mr. Stanley has recorded a case of fracture of this bone, within the hip-joint, at the age of eighteen, it must be admitted from all evidence and experience that fracture in the shaft of the femur happens more frequently in the upper third than in any other part of the bone, after the middle period of life ; and that those in its neck, particularly within the capsule, are of rare occurrence under the age of fifty. Out of two hundred and twenty-five cases which Sir A. Cooper calculated he had seen in public and private practice during a period of thirty-nine years, he had only seen two cases of fracture in the neck of the bone within the capsule under fifty years of age, and during the same period he had only once seen a dislocation of the thigh at the age of sixty-two. These statements, then, ought to be very conclusive on this point; and when a person above the age stated, and more especially above sixty, and being of the female sex, has met with an injury of the hip attend- ed with symptoms of fracture, the chances are that it is within the capsule. The injury is usually the result of a fall, and may be appreciated with tolerable accuracy by the following circumstances and symptoms: the advanced period of life, the patient having pitched on the tro- chanter or hip, and being immediately afterwards unable to move the limb without great pain, are all sufficient to excite suspicion of what has happened: when he is laid in bed, the toes seem much pointed outwards; the whole limb upwards to the trochanter major is everted; it is half an inch, an inch, or more, shorter than its fellow ; the trochanter is less prominent than on the other side; and, besides being further back than its natural position, is also nearer to the crest of the ilium; if the limb be turned inwards, it will of its own accord soon resume its everted position; the knee is usually straight; the whole muscles of the member seem to be paralysed ; the patient makes no effort to move the part; and, if desired, seems incapable of raising the thigh by calling the psoas and iliacus into action ; if, added to all these, there is crepitus, there need be little doubt about the nature of the injury. Crepitus is not easily felt on all occasions, even when there is fracture: the manner in which it can be best detected is by desiring an assistant to draw down the limb, a proceeding which is very easily accomplished, and then, by pushing the trochanter to- wards the acetabulum, and rotating the femur on its long axis, the rough surfaces can be felt grating against each other. It must be confessed, however, that this sensation is often detected only after considerable manipulation and much pain to the patient. The ab- sence of, or difference in, one or more of these symptoms, should nei- ther lull suspicion nor alter the diagnosis: thus, shortening of the

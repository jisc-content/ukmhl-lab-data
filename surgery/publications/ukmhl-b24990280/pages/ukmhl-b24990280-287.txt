DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. 269 neous luxation in hip-disease which has ever come under my notice. A remarkably muscular man, about twenty-five years of age, had a large deep-seated abscess in the hip, which there was reason to sup- pose was connected, by an opening in the sacro-sciatic notch, with in- flammation in the iliac fossa. In the course of three months, during which time he was confined to bed, several openings were formed in the loins to permit the escape of matter, and, latterly, the skin be- tween the lumbar region and upper and back part of the thigh seemed one bag of fluid. For three weeks previous to death, he had suffered greatly from pain in the region of the hip, and would not allow the part to be touched;—indeed, he was so much exhausted that there was no inducement to make any attempt to examine the condition of the joint: during the latter period he lay with the thigh more bent upon the pelvis than ever, and the knee rested on the sound thigh fully four inches above the condyles of the femur ; the trochanter appeared much nearer the anterior part of the crest of the ilium than previously, and a fulness on the dorsum ilii became remarkably distinct before his death. On examining the body afterwards, these latter features were all most conspicuous : and when the skin was elevated, the head of the femur was found in the situation represented in figure 144 : the round ligament was softened and torn across; the capsular —or rather what remained of it—and also the gluteus medius and minimus, with the smaller rotator muscles, were soft, pulpy, broken up, and so infiltrated with pus, that they could scarcely be recognized, and the head of the bone, saving that the cartilage was absorbed, was otherwise as entire as if the displacement had resulted from acci- dental force. The cotyloid ligament had disappeared, but the margin of the cavity where the head had slipped upwards, although in a state of caries, was as prominent as in the healthy condition. It is usually considered that the bones undergo considerable changes ere disloca- tion occurs in such instances, and I believe that they generally do : most preparations in museums prove the latter fact, but 1 imagine that such examples as that just detailed are somewhat rare. There are palpable features in the history of each case, which ought at once to lead to a correct estimation of its true nature; thus, in hip- disease, the patient will have been bedridden for months, perhaps for years, a sufferer from severe pain, which will have rather increased than otherwise from the commencement to the period of examination; the illness will have come on without any apparent cause; for although it may by the friends be attributed to a fall or some other accident, the surgeon will feel certain that immediate displacement could not have been produced thereby; on the other hand, in dislocations result- ing directly from force, the person will have been exposed to some great violence, which has caused immediate lameness, and all the other symptoms of dislocation: if he has been neglected at this period, his sufferings, after the first few days, will have gradually diminished; and though the distortion will still remain as apparent as at first, (perhaps even more so, as the extremity becomes thinner, which it will

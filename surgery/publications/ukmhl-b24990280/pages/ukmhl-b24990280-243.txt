AMPUTATION OF THE FORE-ARM. 225 so as to avoid passing the knife between the bones,â€”a mistake I have seen happen. The first position of the knife and the lines of incision are here shown (fig. 124). The posterior or upper flap, as thus exhibited, Fig. 124. would be small in proportion to that below, but to avoid this, it is well in such a situation, (indeed it is so in most parts of the extremi- ties,) to grasp the textures about to be transfixed, and to elevate them in such a manner as to keep more above the blade than can be done without this manoeuvre. Such a proceeding is well exemplified in the drawing illustrative of amputation in the thigh with anterior and posterior flaps, and it will be found to facilitate transfixion, both for the first and second time. It will often be observed that the tendons hang out of the wound after the flaps are brought into apposition, especially if the incisions have been made near the wrist. It may be advisable sometimes to cut small portions of them away: occasionally I have known these projections slough, whilst at other times no inconvenience has resulted further than a slight difficulty at first in covering them with the skin. The drawing (fig. 125) exhibits a stump made after the method above recommended. The sketch was taken from a patient whose hand I had to remove in consequence of a severe injury by machinery. u

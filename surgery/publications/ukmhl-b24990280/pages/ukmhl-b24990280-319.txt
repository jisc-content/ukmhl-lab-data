FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 301 it may be doubted whether or not a splint should he applied at all ; in fractures of the shaft of the bone, no such doubt can or should be entertained, for ossific union is almost certain to follow, and a splint is of infinite service in keeping the fragments in their proper position ; in the neck of the bone, however, no such union can reasonably be expected; and as any kind of apparatus, such as splints and tight bandages, may be exceedingly troublesome to some parties, nay, ac- tually productive of harm, and as no ultimate benefit can be expected from a persistence in their use, the propriety of applying them at all may well be taken into consideration. For my own part, I am an advocate for the use of a splint in the early stages of treatment. I be- lieve that the shortening of the limb, which is the inevitable result of these injuries, is less when a splint is used during the first eight or ten days, than if none be applied ; after this period, however, it may be doubtful if restraint will be of much further sendee. At first the shortening and continued disposition to an increase of it, as also the tendency to further eversion, may be efficiently counteracted by a splint ; but after the parts have set, as it were, in this way, and after the acute pain and inflammation,—the necessary result of the injury,— have subsided, the sooner a little movement is made, the earlier will a false and callous joint be formed, and the patient begin to make some use of the limb. When the splint is removed, the knee and hip may be slightly bent, and a pillow put under the former, to give it support; as soon as the patient is inclined to leave his bed, he may be permitted to do so : at first he must support himself with crutches; by and by a stick may be substituted ; and, with the additional aid of a high-heeled shoe, he may afterwards move about with great ease and security. In such instances, as I have had frequent opportunities of witnessing on inspection after death, the fragment of the neck nearest the tro- chanter becomes absorbed to a greater or less degree; becomes hard and enamelled on the broken surface ; the textures around thicken, and form a kind of new capsule; occasionally.-even a little bone is de- posited on various parts in the vicinity; and the obturator externus and other muscles attached to the digital fossa, behind the trochanters, become considerably increased in bulk and strength. The above method cannot be accomplished in some cases, and in others it would not be correctly applicable ; thus in certain individuals the tightness of the bandage around the ankle is sufficient to threaten or induce sloughing, and in others similar effects are produced by the band under the pelvis; sometimes there may be positive objections to this plan, from the state of the ankle or perineum ; again, if the patient is very aged, and otherwise infirm, and likely to be little ca- pable of using or requiring the limb in any active exertion at a future period, it may not be thought proper to harass him with any incumbrances, or at all events the advantage gained (if any) will not be equivalent to the vexatious restraint; but, on the other hand, if the patient be comparatively young and stout, and if there be the

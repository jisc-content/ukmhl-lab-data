THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 198 tumour may here be supposed to be small, but it must sometimes be much more extensive than is represented. Fitj. 100. It is often requisite in the removal of the mamma to take away at the same time diseased glands in or near the axilla. For this pur- pose, the extremity of the wound nearest the armpit should be ex- tended by an incision into this space, when, by separating its edges, the glands may be uncovered, and, if they are small and loosely con- nected, the knife may be carried round them on all sides. This in- strument cannot be used too cautiously in this space, however, and it will be safer to use the fingers a good deal, and, in a manner, to tear out the glands, only making small incisions from time to time, when the cellular membrane does not easily give way. When the textures about to be cut cannot be readily seen, and when there is any suspi- cion of a vessel of magnitude being in danger, the glands should be separated from their surrounding connexions as well as can be accom- plished by moderate force with the fingers or handle of the knife, and after a loop of strong thread has been cast around the remaining tissues, the knife may then be applied between it and the part to be removed. In some instances the diseased glands are so near the mamma, and so loosely connected, that they may be dissected out at the same time, and with the same incisions ; but it is frequently more convenient to take away the large mass first. These proceedings in the axilla are almost invariably attended with more trouble than the other steps of the operation: to facilitate them, and in some degree to avert the danger of cutting in this situation, I strongly

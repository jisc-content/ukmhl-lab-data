“ ■* THE SUPERIOR EXTREJIITV. variety of ways, such as by a circular incision, or by leaving two flaps, one on each side of the linger; but after operating in all the different Fig. 109. manners recommended by different surgeons, I seldom resort to any other than those above described, and of the two I generally give the preference to that in the phalanx between the joints, as in figure 109. When the whole finger is to be removed, the knife should be passed from one side of the joint to the other in this way: the heel of the blade should be laid on the skin, about half an inch below the articu- lation, when by drawing it downwards, with a little pressure to- wards the joint, the lateral ligament will be reached, and should then be cut; the knife should next be carried across the articulation, and then outwards, so as to make a flap similar to the one already made on the opposite side. After the vessels have been secured (two will perhaps require to be tied) the opposite surfaces should be kept in apposition by means of a couple of stitches ; a fold of lint should then be applied over the wound, and retained with a bandage carried round the hand, which will also have the effect of keeping the fingers still. After the separation of the finger, as above described, I strongly re- commend the removal of a portion of the metacarpal bone ere the margins of the wound are brought into contact. This can easily be done by carrying the point of the bistoury round the bone, about three fourths of an inch above its extremity, and then dividing it with the forceps. The flaps, however, might be a little too long were the incision made so low down as in the operation just described, and those represented in this hand (fig. 110), will leave flaps sufficiently long to make an excellent cicatrix, provided the end of the metacarpal bone is removed ; but if

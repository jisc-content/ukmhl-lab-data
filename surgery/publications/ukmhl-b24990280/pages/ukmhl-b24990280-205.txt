FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE. 187 is placed over the inner fragment when it shows any disposition to rise, and then some additional turns over the shoulders are required. Two belts, one passing round each shoulder, and drawn towards each other behind, between the scapulae, so as to keep the shoulders well back, or a figure of 8 as shown in cut 94, made behind from shoulder to shoulder, will serve the same purpose as the above plan; indeed, in most instances, one or other of these two methods may be preferred, and whichever is adopted, the fore-arm must be carried in a sling until the fragments have united. Fig. 94. I once had occasion to remove various fragments of this bone, which had become necrosed in consequence of neglected treatment. The patient, a fine young man about twenty years of age, had the right collar bone broken by the falling of a tree; not being aware of the nature of the injury, he worked as a reaper for several hours after, until obliged to desist from excessive pain: violent inflammation, sup- puration, and necrosis followed; but alter the dead portions were re- moved, he made a rapid and excellent recovery. Fractures of the clavicle will often cause greater trouble than those which are considered of a more serious character, and the utmost pains will not on all occasions suffice to prevent a slight prominence of the innei fragment. Fortunately, however, this condition is productive of no future inconvenience.

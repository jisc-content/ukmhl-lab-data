DISLOCATIONâ€™S OP THE ANKLE-JOINT. 259 The great mass of evidence collected by Sir Astley Cooper seems to settle the line of practice to be followed in by far the greater number of injuries of the ankle-joint; whether the case be one of simple or of compound dislocation, or the latter, complicated with extensive wound of the skin, contusion, and laceration of the other soft parts, and even severe fracture of the bones in the vicinity, the surgeon is fully en- titled to give the patient a chance of having his foot preserved. The pulleys may be applied to facilitate reduction, where much difficulty is experienced ; loose portions of bone must be picked away ; projections may be cut off with the saw or pliers, or the aperture in the skin may be enlarged with the knife; in short, any reasonable expedient may be resorted to in order to save the foot, which, whatever be its after condition, will in general be preferred, by most patients, to any artificial substitute. In the example here represented (fig. 137), it was deemed ex- pedient to remove the foot, in consequence of the apparent extent of injury to the soft parts in front of the joint; but the practice may seem very questionable, when, in the evidence above referred to it is proved, in some of the cases, that the patients actually stood and walked on the protruded end of the tibia, and yet most satis- factory recoveries followed. I fear, however, that in the attempts which have been made to save the foot, the results in all the cases have not met with the same publicity ; that the instances where amputation has afterwards been necessary, or where death has been the consequence, have not also been recorded ; and from what I have myself seen, I would caution the inexperienced practitioner from being over sanguine in anticipating a happy result in every example. Mr.-> Pott, in referring to fracture of the fibula, with displacement of the foot outwards, and protrusion of the end of the tibia inwards, has

276 THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. Although I have strongly recommended the pulleys in such cases, I do not deem them absolutely necessary in all; indeed, as already stated, I have known the hands of the surgeon alone succeed, when other and more violent means had failed; I am therefore not surprised at the proposal of M. Colombot to reduce such luxations by the hands only, although I shall take leave to express my doubt as to the supe- riority of the practice. This gentleman places the body and limb in a favourable position for relaxing, as much as possible, all the muscles which may be supposed to oppose or prevent the return of the head of the bone, and then by using the femur as a lever, and moving the limb in all directions, the reduction, during some fortunate chance, is accomplished. A similar method is known to have succeeded in the shoulder; and it has been affirmed, too, that an accidental twist of the thigh, received by a person falling over the gunwale of a boat, has caused the head of the bone to pass into its natural position, after dis- location had existed for more than a year. With reference to the most distant date at which it will be proper to attempt these operations, I shall here also call attention to my remarks on this subject, in regard to the shoulder. I have myself seen attempts made in various instances of old standing, but have not witnessed a successful effort beyond the period of three weeks. Sir Astley Cooper has described instances of a more fortunate kind, after the lapse of four, five, six, and seven weeks ; and I should certainly deem it quite correct to make trial of all reasonable means, at a much longer date than this, although, after two or three months, I should not be at all sanguine of a favourable result. I purposely omit any particular allusions to congenital luxations of the hip, as not coming, strictly, within the scope of this work.

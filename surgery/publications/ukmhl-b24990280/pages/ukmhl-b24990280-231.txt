213 AMPUTATION OP PHALANGES. the part had better always be thus enveloped, as the surgeon can then grasp it more readily with his left hand, and move it in such directions as will facilitate the progress of the knife. Fig. 108. If the operation is done between the articulations, (that is, in the continuity of a phalanx,) I recommend it to be performed in this way: a blade, similar to that exhibited in the drawings, should be pushed from one side of the finger to the other, close in front of the bone, and a flap made from this surface; a lunated incision should then be made across the posterior aspect down to the bone, when, by using the cutting forceps, the amputation will be completed. Figure 109 shows the position of the knife after transfixion, and the lines exhibit the length of each flap. Here the point of the finger has been left uncovered, to illustrate the recommendation in the preced- ing page ; for it must be apparent, from the condition of the end of the finger, that the operator cannot have such a secure hold of it as when covered by rag or surgeonsâ€™ lint. In either of these proceedings two arteries may require to be tied, though it is possible that no ligature may be necessary, and in both a single stitch will suffice to keep the edges in contact. Amputation of one or more of the phalanges may be done in a

DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. 26.5 sciatic notch, and in the other directions, considerable differences in position have been remarked ; in one example, the limb will appear much shorter, compared with its fellow, than in another: again, the toes or foot may be more pointed inwards or outwards in one patient than another, and all these circumstances, it will be perceived, indi- cate corresponding varieties in the position of the head of the bone. Figure 144 exhibits the skeleton of the displacement upwards and backwards: the shaft of the bone (at the trochanter) would probably lie more completely over the acetabulum. Here the head may be in some cases a little nearer the anterior part of the crest, — per- haps immediately under the anterior spine,—possibly a little more forwards, or it may be further backwards, and either more down- wards or upwards; of which, however, though examples of all such cases have been seen, I do not think it necessary to give pictorial illustrations. Fig. 145. Drawing 145 shows a rarer kind of displacement: here the head of the bone is hooked, as it were, upon the horizontal ramus of the pubes, having passed partly into the pelvis; but in luxation in this

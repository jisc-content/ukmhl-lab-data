THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 22G The remaining part of the fore-ami is sufficiently long to admit of any kind of apparatus being applied as a substitute for the hand. It may be well on all occasions to keep the latter object in view : the part can scarcely be left too long for the attachment of anything of the kind, but the surgeon might inadvertently apply the knife so close upon the elbow, as to leave too short a portion below for the purpose in ques- tion. Amputation, as above described, may be performed in the fore-arm at any point between the wrist and elbow with equal facility; the radial and ulnar artery will each require a ligature, the interosseal arteries, particularly the anterior, will also require to be tied, and possibly one or two more of a smaller size. The flaps may next be laid together, and retained by means of three or four stitches. During the performance of these operations, the circulation must be arrested by compressing the humeral artery with the fingers or tour- niquet, as recommended, and exhibited in the drawings, at pages 19 and 22. In those at the wrist, the assistant who holds the arm may compress the two main arteries with the points of his fin- gers until ligatures are applied; and the like may be done, if required, during the minor proceedings on the hand and fingers. I need scarcely add, that the circular operation may be applied in any part of the fore-arm; but considering the flat shape of the member, and other circumstances referred to in the chapter on amputation, I should on all occasions give the flap method the preference in this locality. It will be observed that in describing these different operations, I do not enter into such minute details as some may expect; but I must beg of the reader, when he is not satisfied in these respects, occasion- ally to refer to the introduction, where he may possibly find what he

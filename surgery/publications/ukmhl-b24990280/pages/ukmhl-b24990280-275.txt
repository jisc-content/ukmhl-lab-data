the tibia resting on the upper and 2o/ DISLOCATIONS OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. Fig. 135. the distance between the ankle and toes is diminished, whilst tile heel is more prominent than natural. The fibula is fractured above the malleolus, and it will rarely be otherwise. Figure 134 shows the displacement of the foot forwards, back part of the os calcis, the fibula being broken in this instance also. In both of these drawings the at- titude is such as would most pro- bably be present, although it might vary in many respects, which, how- ever, require no particular comment at present. Such displacements as those above delineated are comparatively rare, and the same may be said of that of the foot inwards, the fibula and tibia being thrown to the outer side of the tarsus. In this case the malleolus intemus will, in almost all instances, be broken ; and in all probability the fibula will have suffered in the same way. The sketch at the side of the page (fig. 135) gives a kind' of diagram of such a case, although were the parts so much displaced as is here represented, there would doubtless be wounds in the inte- guments, through which some of the fragments would project.

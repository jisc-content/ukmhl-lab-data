387 LIGATURE OF ARTERIES. margin of the scalenus; but it may be a little towards the middle of its anterior surface, although it is perhaps more frequently slightly separated from the margin by some loose cellular tissue. In the dissecting-room it is an easy matter so to contrive the incisions as to permit a saw to be applied to the middle of the cla- vicle for the purpose of dividing it, and thus exposing the artery more completely. On the living subject, however, I can scarcely imagine such a case as to require or warrant this proceeding. If the aneurism is high, large, and encroaches on the clavicle, in all probability the bone will actually form a portion of the sac : here, then, such a step is inadmissible, and if the tumour is not in the condition described, I cannot suppose that the proceeding is at all necessary. Perhaps in such a case as that just referred to, or in an instance of a small aneurism connected with the vessel between or immediately outside of the scaleni, the surgeon might endeavour to deligate the subclavian at a point still nearer the heart. Such an operation, how- ever, can only be resorted to on the right side, for on the left the vessel lies so very deep that, in so far as I am aware, no such pro- ceeding has ever been accomplished on the living body. The patient should be on his back, with the shoulders slightly raised, a pillow being placed under the neck, so as to allow his head to hang a little; care, however, being taken not to depress it so much as to cause him any uneasiness. The surgeon should stand on the patient’s right side, or at his head, being guided by circumstances or taste in selecting his place, l’or my own part, I should prefer stand- ing at the end of the table, so as to look, as it were, over the patient’s face.

DISLOCATIONS OF THE WRIST. 155 was detached from its lower connexions by the action of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Little benefit can be expected from any attempt to keep this bone in its proper position, nor, indeed, is the displacement of much consequence. The carpus may be displaced either backwards or forwards, or in a lateral direction. In the latter case, the dislocation cannot be com- plete without great injury, which may possibly necessitate amputa- tion. In the former of these examples, the hand with the bones of the carpus may be deemed the moveable parts, as indeed they really are. When the first row of the carpus is driven from the articular sur- face of the radius, in a direction backwards or forwards, the projection thus formed, and the corresponding one on the opposite side, can leave small doubt of the nature of the injuiy. The two skeletons (figs. 6'2 and 63) will give the student a tolerably correct idea of each of these luxations, although it should always be remembered, that in the living body the appearances may not be altogether so clear. With these sketches, as with those of the fingers and thumb, the state of flexion is such as, I believe, will generally be met with in practice, although occasionally the angle may be more or less acute, as most surgeons of experience must have noticed. Little difficulty will be met with in reducing these displacements, provided they are seen at an early period After the lapse of ten or fifteen days, it may be a question whether or not it will be safe to apply such a degree of force as may be required. I have seen one case where reduction was accomplished with tolerable ease after fourteen days, and all went on favourably afterwards. In this in-

321 REMOVAL OF LOOSE CARTILAGES FROM KNEE-JOINT. amples, it appears that coagulation does not occur, although, partly with a view to ascertain this, I have included an inch or more of the enlarged and distended saphena on the inner side of the knee, be- tween two needles, and have, on withdrawing them before much in- flammatory action was excited, discovered that the circulation has gone on immediately after, almost in as full a volume as before. Out of numerous instances in which I have resorted to this practice, I have met with no seriously unpleasant effects ; in one case only has there been a slight suppuration around the needles ; but as already stated, a cure has not been the invariable result: the practice, how- ever, is an admirable addition to surgery ; and whatever may be the opinioji ultimately formed by the profession of its utility in the treat- ment of varicose veins, there can be little doubt of its eligibility in instances of rupture of the enlarged saphena, — an accident by no means of rare occurrence. Some months ago there was a patient in King’s College Hospital, with varicose veins of the leg: she had been admitted in consequence of rupture of the saphena, in the site of a small ulcer. By rest in the horizontal position, and the usual lotions, ointments, 6cc., the surface healed, and the patient was dis- missed cured, but she returned within a few days, the vein having again given way, and the cicatrix having burst; needles were then applied, and caused the obliteration of the vessel above and below the ulcer; when the latter was healed the patient was again dismissed, and has since remained cured. Occasionally the surgeon may deem it requisite to cut into the knee-joint, for the purpose of removing loose cartilages ; and as it is a wound which ought not to be thought lightly of, in so far as the safety of the patient is concerned, it would be advisable to try palliative measures before resorting to such a proceeding. The ap- plication of a common roller to the knee, or any apparatus to restrain the movements of the joint, or to fix the loose substance in one posi- tion, where its presence will not cause further annoyance, should first be tried; and if it is then found that something more must be done, the cartilage may be removed. The operation may be thus accom- plished :—The patient’s limb should be placed horizontally, and the body should be slightly raised to relax the extensor muscles in front of the thigh ; by pressure with the fingers, the loose object should then be worked to one side of the patella, until it lies in front of one or other of the condyles of the femur, and the internal should, if pos- sible, be preferred ; the surgeon should then draw the skin slightly upwards, and keep the object steadily fixed between the fore-fingers and thumb of his left hand ; he should next cut boldly down upon it, with an incision of sufficient size to allow it to escape, which it usually does by starting suddenly through the wound,—a movement which may be much expedited by gentle pressure with the points of the fingers. As soon as the substance is away, the skin should be allowed to resume its natural position, when the aperture on the surface will be half an inch or more below that through the synovial capsule.

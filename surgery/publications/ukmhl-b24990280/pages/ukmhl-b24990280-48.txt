If the parts be deep-seated and difficult to reach, the latter form will be most convenient, more particularly if some considerable force is required to pass the needle. In passing threads through small tumours, too, such as naevi and hemorrhoids, this kind will be found exceedingly convenient. When these means are resorted to, a little more than the bleeding- vessel must necessarily be included in the ligature ; and though, in general, this circumstance is of no great moment, the rule in surgery ought never to be forgotten, of including the bleeding vessels only, when such a proceeding is practicable. The end of each ligature should be cut with scissors, as when a knife is used for the purpose, however sharp its edge may be, it will drag out the end of the vessel, and, besides causing additional pain, may actually separate the ligature. The common dissecting scissors (p. 6) will answer ; but there may be danger in some cases from the sharp point, and such as those here exhibited (fig. 33), which, for

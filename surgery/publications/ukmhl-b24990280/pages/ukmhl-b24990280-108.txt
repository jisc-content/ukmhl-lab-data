90 ERYSIPELAS. around, the ends of the fragments are often so denuded of periosteum, that they are certain to die. In some, I might almost say in many, instances of simple erysipelas, when, throughout the whole active progress of the inflammation, there have been no symptoms of suppuration, the presence of matter is de- tected when it is least expected ; and this will occur, too, when the disease has, to all appearance, ceased; there may be one abscess or several, but it seldom happens that beyond a few drachms or ounces of pus collect; and moreover, unlike the example of the phlegmonous form of the disease, the matter is usually surrounded by condensed cellular substance, as in the case of common abscess ; indeed, I con- sider that for several weeks after an attack of simple erysipelas, the textures, particularly the subcutaneous cellular tissue, are extremely liable to suppuration. These abscesses shoidd be treated according to the method already described for simple collections of matter. There are few injuries or diseases of the body or of its textures, regions, or members, to which the foregoing methods of treatment are not more or less applicable. The diseases of the skin which fall imder the province of surgery, such as pimple, pustule, boil, carbuncle, and ulcers ; the effects of heat, as exemplified in scalds and bums ; those of cold, as chilblain and frost-bite, may all be treated according to the rules inculcated in the preceding pages ; nor does it require much ad- ditional skill to apply them to those of the mucous membrane, blood- vessels, nerves, muscles, tendons, bones, sheaths, bursae, and joints. As it is not within the intended scope of this work, to name or de- scribe the nature and treatment of all the diseases to which these textures are liable, I shall not profess to do so; but notwithstanding it will be afterwards found in treating of the injuries and diseases of the different regions, that few subjects of much interest to the surgeon, such as he may meet with in ordinary practice in this country, have been overlooked.

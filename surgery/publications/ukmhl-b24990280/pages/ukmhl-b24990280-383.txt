AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT. 36.5 being no longer required, the assistant should bring the head of the femur a little forwards to allow the knife to be slipped over it, and when it is in the position represented in the design, it should then be carried downwards and backwards in the course of the line, so as to form a flap somewhat longer than that in front, the last cut completing the separation of the limb. By means of the fingers of assistants (and here one or two more than those referred to may be of service) and the application of sponges, the bleeding may in some degree be restrained until ligatures are applied. If the vessels seem large on the posterior flap, it will be best to secure them first, and then the femoral and such other branches as may require ligature in the front flap should be attended to. If, however, there is any fear of the main vessel eluding the grasp of the assistant, there will be greater safety in tying it first. If, in making the anterior flap, the knife is kept close to the femur for some way down, the superficial femoral will not be divided until the incision is nearly completed, and this branch •with those of the profunda may all be sufficiently compressed whilst the hand is used in the manner above described. Delpech and others have recommended ligature of the femoral artery as a preliminary step, but it seems unnecessary, mid the pro- ceeding has not been frequently resorted to. Pressure with the thumbs on the brim of the pelvis has also been recommended ; but as there can be no bleeding of any consequence until the main vessel is cut across, and as it is quite possible for the assistant to have his fingers behind it, as the surgeon cuts towards the surface, this prelimi- nary pressure is not required : should the assistant, however, be unable to squeeze the flap sufficiently tight, he should at once apply pressure on the common femoral at Poupart’s ligament, with the thumb of the hand which is free, or he may commit the flap to the charge of another, and apply both. When thus placed, however, they may prevent the flap being raised with the same facility as when they are absent, and it is of some consequence that the operator should see where to apply the knife when he is about to cut the capsular ligament. I have not inculcated the necessity of introducing the point of the blade a certain number of lines distant from the spine of the ilium, nor have I been very precise as to the exact distance from the anus at which it should protrude, for I believe that the operator, instead of limiting himself to lines here, may actually take the freedom of inches: his object should be to make as broad a flap in front as the method by transfixion will admit of; but whether he pushes in the knife, or brings it out, an inch above or the same length below certain given distances, seems to me of very little consequence: if he begins low down, he has to cut so much deeper, as it were, ere he reaches the capsule, and if this is a disadvantage, it is, perhaps, compensated by the wound on and near the surface being a little further from the trunk : if he introduces the point much behind the tensor vaginas femoris, he cannot with safety carry it so near the anus as if it

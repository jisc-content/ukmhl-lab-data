AMPUTATIONS OK THE THIGH. 359 Fig. 191. at right angles. The young surgeon should remember, however, that if he slopes the knife in this way, and if the knee is much bent, as it often is in cases of white-swelling, there is a risk of thrusting its point into the calf of the leg below, as 1 have actually witnessed on the living body. The projection of the bone through the anterior part of the wound, when the amputation is above the middle of the thigh, lias been found so difficult to counteract, in consequence partly of the action of the psoas and iliacus interims muscles, and the weight and contraction of the muscles behind, as to induce most surgeons who practise the flap operation to select the covering from the anterior and posterior sur- faces; in fact, it is now generally the custom with some operators to make anterior and posterior flaps in all parts of the thigh, and I have myself latterly often resorted to this method, partly with a view to obviate the ill effects above referred to, but chiefly because I find it to possess an advantage over the other, which does not seem to have attracted so much attention as, in my opinion, it deserves. The ope- ration I perform is as follows:â€”grasping the soft parts, so as to bring them well forward, I push the knife across from the outside and form a flap in front ; this being slightly elevated I again carry the knife in the direction which it first took, but behind the bone, and form the second flap from the posterior surface, taking care to leave it at least an inch longer than the anterior: the rest of the proceedings are con- ducted as in the other operation. The dotted lines in the next cut (fig. 192) exhibit the comparative length of the flaps, and the seeming arch of the thigh has been accurately represented from nature. When the knife is thus placed, if the parts are as fully drawn forwards as they should be, they give this appearance of distortion, but the sketch was purposely taken in this stage of the operation with the object of illustrating this feature, and the manner in which the operator may

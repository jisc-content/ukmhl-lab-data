TREPHINE. 431 and the diploe may be cut with a bold and free movement, but cau- tion is requisite when the inner plate is encountered : the central pin should now be drawn above the level of the serrated edge, and again by more cautious movements the vitreous table must be divided: when the incision is supposed to be nearly complete the instrument must be removed: an elevator should then be introduced so as to raise the loosened portion, and the rest of the operation must be conducted according to circumstances. When a foreign substance, blood, or mat- ter, is sought for under the cranium, a circular piece of bone is thus removed ; but in the case of de- pressed fracture, only a little more than a semicircular portion requires to be cut, and this, be it observed by the young student, is taken , from the sound portion of bone, not that which is depressed; for the sole object in applying the instrument in a case of the kind is, to permit the introduction of a lever to elevate the portion at fault. In such a case I have known the cutting pliers used instead, or a small saw, similar to those afterwards represented for the operations on the jaws. In using the trephines commonly sold, it is necessary to raise them from the groove from time to time, so as to allow the particles of bone to be brushed away, but the blade being slit up and perforated in the manner represented in the sketch obviates this. However, towards the latter part of the proceedings it is proper to remove the teeth once or twice and to examine the fissure with the point of a probe, a strip of quill, or any other convenient article, so as to make sure that the dura mater is not in danger from the skull-cap being thicker on one side of the opening than on the other. In the instance of fracture the operator can scarcely go wrong as to the proper part for applying the instrument, but in other instances he may discover that he has erred in his diagnosis, or he may then (not finding that which he has expected) think of opening another part of the cranium, either immediately contiguous or at a distance. Such pro- ceedings arc now rarely ever heard of, yet, under the desperate cir- cumstances of the patient, I should consider the surgeon justified in making further search ; provided always .that he has some degree of reason on his side, (such as that the patient is not actually in artivulo, Fig. 201.

AMPUTATION. 13G 'vantage of either of these materials is, that the usual discharges from a wound do not affect them, as they do the common adhesive strap, and the caoutchouc is said to possess the advantage of elasticity, whereby it expands with the swelling incidental to a wound, and con- tracts again as it subsides. I feel inclined, however, after using both, to give the preference to the ordinary and older-fashioned adhesive straps, of which perhaps not the least advantage is, that the necessity for their frequent repetition ensures a greater degree of care towards the stump. When union by the first intention does not take place, or if this is not expected, as in some instances when it is advisable to stuff the wound with lint to check hemorrhage, the treatment must be such as to encourage suppuration and granulation; and if care be taken, as the latter process is going on, to keep the soft parts properly supported by straps and bandages, the wound may ultimately heal so perfectly, that it may be difficult for a stranger to say whether it has healed by immediate union or by granulation. Most of the casualties likely to follow an amputation are treated of in different parts of this volume, and such as are not particularly re- ferred to, are usually of a nature requiring no especial notice here, as I imagine that a slight acquaintance with the principles of surgery will enable even the youngest practitioner to treat each case according to the combined dictates of skill and prudence.

FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. 299 other period ; I have, therefore, The remarkable frequency of these injuries in aged females, com- pared with their occurrence in man, must have been observed by all who have had much experience. It is usual to attribute the facility with which the fracture happens to the natural change in the direc- tion of the neck of the bone, which is the result of advanced years. In youth it shoots obliquely from the shaft, but in old age it passes off from between the trochanters, almost at a right angle; some- times the trochanter major is actually above the level of the head of the bone, and it is by no means uncommon to find the neck shorter, and even less in diameter, than in the early or middle periods of life. It is evident that in the erect position the weight of the trunk must, in the young person, be transmitted through the femur more directly in the long axis of its neck, and that under such circumstances it must be capable of supporting a much greater weight than when passing horizontally between the trochanter and the acetabulum ; but at any period of life, so far as I know, the fracture never occurs when the patient is upright; it happens during a fall on the hip or trochanter, at which time it may be supposed that the weight of the pelvis is supported more directly in the long axis of the neck than at any often doubted whether or not these alterations in the line of the bone have much influence in the produc- tion of fracture, and have been more inclined to attribute their fre- quent occurrence in old age to the triable state of the bones at this period, as also to the circumstance of the neck, from its thinness and cellular character, being the weakest part: and if in all these views I am correct, the frequency of the acci- dent in females may be reasonably attributed, cateris paribus, to the greater projections of the trochan- ter in them, from the width of the pelvis, than in the male subject. If, however, the fracture occurs in con- sequence of the limb being twisted under the other, as it generally is in a fall on the trochanter, then, of course, the altered line of the neck of the bone above referred to must render the part particularly liable to the injury. The diagnosis of fracture in the upper part of the femur, or in the

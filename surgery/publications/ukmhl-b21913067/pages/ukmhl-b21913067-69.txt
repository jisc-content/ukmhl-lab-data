[ 37 ] PLASTIC OPERATIONS FOR LOSS OF NOSE, LOWER EYELIDS, ETC. BY THOMAS T. SABINE, M.D., Professor of Anatomy, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New YorTc. Thomas Colt, age 25, IT. S.

This finally healed after having destroyed the nose, both lower eyelids, part of the lips, especially the upper, and part of cheeks. He came under my notice in 1878, at which time he presented the appearance seen in the two upper pho- tographs of plate YI. The corner, from constant exposure, had become hazy, so that' he was unable to read, and the mouth could be closed but little more than is seen in plate YI. I felt disinclined to do any- thing, as the tissues to be operated on were cicatricial, and I feared that the old disease might return. I heard nothing from him for some months, when he again applied to me. I consented to do an operation for restoration of the right lower lid, intend- ing to be guided by the result of this as to any further proceedings. May 28, 1S78.—Fig. 28.—An in- cision ABCD, was made, marking out a flap which was dissected up as far as AD. The skin Avas then removed from the semi- circle a, and the flap doubled upon itself along the dotted line and raised in such a way that the surface above the dotted line lookqd backwards toward the eyeball, the surface below looked forward, the part at dotted line forming margin of the lid ; b fitted into a ; which part of the Fis. 28.

SARCOMA OF THE ANTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. [ 161 1 root of the right lung, surrounding in part the right bronchus; it extended over the base of the heart, arch of the aorta, and pulmonary vessels, so as to effectually hide the aortic branches. Both lungs were smaller by far than normal, though both were thoroughly permeable to air, and neither con- tained deposits. The amount of pulmonary collapse seemed due to the great feebleness of the patient, which prevented anything like a thorough expansion of the lungs, for no organic changes were noticeable, except that part of the right lung to which the tumor had grown, and at the point for the space of an inch or so the pulmonary tissue was thickened and not permeable to air. Liver was of a dark bronze color, with no secondary deposits in it. Spleen slightly enlai’ged, friable, and of dark color. Stomach empty, contracted, and without secondary involvement. Bowels nor- mal A large mesenteric gland was found near the pancreas, which broke down in removing it; its character was cheesy. Uterus, ova- ries, and bladder presented nothing of an abnormal type. The kid- neys, however, were very large, measuring 6^ inches in length by .‘U in breadth; the capsule was non-adherent, or at least very slightly so; in color a pinkish white; on section thoroughly anaemic around the thickened cortical part, while the cones by contrast at least appeared redder than usual. The microscopic character of the large white kidney was unmistakable. Sections of the tumor show it to be a sarcoma of the round-celled variety, though a number of spindle-cells are scattered throughout the stroma.

ILLUSTRATED MEDICINE AND SURGERY. [ 8G ] “Feb. 8.—Pt. is sitting up. Breathes freely through his mouth. “ Feb. 21.—The incision has healed within the mouth, and, on the outside, as far back as to the angle of the jaw ; behind that is a cavity, which is granulating. The tracheotomy tube was removed a few days ago, and the opening has closed. Fig. 84. “Mar. 3.—The tumor is growing rapidly in the soft palate, and a gland above the left cheek has become as large as a horse-chestnut. “ Apr. 13.—Replaced the tracheotomy tube; the trachea was displaced to the right about an inch. The growth has extended down the pharynx beyond the reach of the finger, and involves the margin of the glottis. “May 19.—The tumor in the neck is enormous, half as large as the boy’s head. The glands on the opposite side are involved. “ July 12.—Otto died to-day of exhaustion. The tumor had grown to an enormous size, and a week before his death ulcerated on the cheek, the ulcer extending through into the mouth. The trachea and the tube were pushed far over to the right. The veins on the front of the chest were much enlarged. Towards the last he had some difficulty in swallowing even liquid food.” No autopsy allowed. The photograph was taken two or three days before his death.

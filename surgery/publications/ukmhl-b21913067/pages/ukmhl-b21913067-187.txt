[ 109 ] EXCISION OF THE SHOULDER JOINT. BY RANDOLPH WINSLOW, MIX, Demonstrator of Anatomy in the University of Maryland, and Professor of Surgery in the TJ Oman's Medical College of Baltimore, Charles C. Smith, negro, aged 39 years, a rag-picker by trade, was ad- mitted to the University Hospital on May 29th, 1882, with the diagnosis of caries of the shoulder joint.

The periosteum and capsular liga- ment were divided longitudinally, and with the insertions of the pericapsular muscles were separated

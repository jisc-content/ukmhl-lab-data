Great as is the relief thus depicted, it is not more marked than that which attends mechanical treatment in this stage of the disease. When fixation is secured, the anxious look gives way to an expression of repose, appetite and sleep return, and the reparative process begins. As Mr. Hancock has suggested, the question of recovery after exsection is a momentous one. It is a serious question even when the operation is performed under the most favorable circumstances, such as surrounded the patients of Mr. Annaudale. He was accustomed to operate at a very early stage of the disease. In one of his cases, a girl of sixteen years, the duration of the disease, previous to the operation, is recorded as three weeks. In the twenty-two cases which he reported in 1876, there were only five in which external sinuses existed. It will be seen from these facts that his cases were exceptionally favorable for operation, because they had not been weakened by exhausting discharges and long periods of suffering. Yet in these twenty-two cases death occurred in eight, at periods ranging from three to eighteen months after the operation (Edinburgh Medical Journal, February, 1S76, p. 694). As hip disease derives its desperate character (its quasi malignancy) from the difficulty experienced in securing rest, and not from the nature of the disease, which is sufficiently amenable to treatment when occurring in other parts of the body, it follows that the rate of mortality is diminished by providing efficient rest and avoiding the risks of operation. Finally, in regard to the usefulness of the limb, the firm attitude shown in the figures,* the facility in walking and running possessed by the patients, and their ability to endure fatigue, leave but little to be desired for the results of treatment. The figures are from photographs in the library of the New York Hospital.

[ 119 ] CONGENITAL UNION OF THE FINGERS. with TWO OTHER CASES OE MALFORMATION OF THE HAND. BY J. H. POOLEY, M.D., Formerly Professor of Surgery in Starling Medical College. Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in the Columbus Medical College. Thomas E. B., aged sixteen, a native of the United States, came under my care May 20, 1874. He was the subject of a very interesting and complete congenital fusion of the phalanges of both hands and feet, Syndactilitis universalis. As one hand and foot was an almost exact duplicate of the other, a description of one will suffice for an understanding of both. Taking, then, the right hand for description, we find the following peculiarities: Dorsal aspectâ€” 1st. The ring and middle fingers are entirely united from their commissure to their extremities. While normally the middle finger projects somewhat be- yond the index and ring fin- gers, in this case it is not so, as the extremities of the united fingers are on a level with each other, being made so by their close union, and }Tet the mid- dle finger is of its normal length. It is therefore curved, with its convexity outward, on the hack of the hand, where it rises or projects above its neighbors; and it is plain that if the unnatural connection were severed it would project J beyond the digit on either side of it, as in a normal hand.

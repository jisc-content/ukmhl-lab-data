THE THERAPEUTIC USES OF RUBBER TUBING. joined by causing the opposed ends to meet over a bit of glass tube having a diameter larger than the lumen of the rubber tube. When enough has been laid, the border of the coil is drawn toward the edge of the table, and, while one section is confined by a band passing from the outer to the inner border, the rest of the coil is kept flat and in place by a ruler or a book laid over it. The best way of making the bands, in the case of coils of large tubing, is to take smaller tubing cut in lengths equal to the diameter of the coil; slide into these lengths pieces of copper wire; bend the tube and wire like a hairpin, and pass one arm above and one below the surface of the coil. Tie these arms together at the inner border of the coil, and also between the strands of the coil; see PI. 73.. For coils made of smaller tubing, take the wire ribbon (“wire taste”) used by milliners; bend like a hairpin over and under the coil, and sew between the strands. PI. 75 shows a coil laid upon the head; one held over the eye, and one fastened around the throat. In the eye coil, the circles are maintained by a silver wire drawn through the lumen of the rubber tube. Made thus,—i. e., in either of the ways named,—the coil may be shaped to fit any surface, however irregular. The bent bands will retain it in any form, and it may be drawn out or compressed like a coil of wire. PI. 70 shows an appliance for the spine. For this purpose about ten feet of stout tube, one- halt' inch in calibre, should be used, and a brass wire, stiff enough to neutralize the elasticity of the [ 1

[ 84 ] ILLUSTRATED MEDICINE AND SURGERY. Case I. illustrates the malignant character of the spindle-celled form of sarcoma—a feature which has been denied by some authors, but which has been definitely established by the researches of Prof. S. W. Gross.

The time at which the internal deposits occurred is un- certain, but, from the extreme prostration, it is probable that they existed before the first operation was performed. The freedom from disease of the axillary glands is a well-known feature of this sort of neoplasm.

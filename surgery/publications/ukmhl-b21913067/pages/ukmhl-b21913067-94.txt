I do not know who has the credit of introducing it in America, but early in 1S71, I saw my preceptor, Professor Henry B. Sands, apply several grafts, and he then spoke of it as something entirely new. Mons. Ollier* * * § claims priority over Reverdin ; and says he grafted periosteum, seven years l>efore, though his results were published three years after Reverdin's successful cases. 1. Sources of supply.—The skin from any part of the body, provided it is not too thick and horny, may be used. Formerly, I supposed I was the first to graft from amputated limbs,f but learned afterwards that it had been previously done in Boston4 The results however, are unpublished. I have grafted successfully from a limb which had not been kept warm, eight hours after ampu- tation, and indeed it is said that in dead bodies the skin of animals and the lining membrane of an egg have been used successfully for this purpose. 3. Method. — Reverdin and Mr. Fides describe the cutaneous grafts as “ epidermic graft- ing,” [j the former believing the epidermis to be the active part of the operation.§ The graft usually includes both derma and epidermis; but should not contain any of the subjacent cellular tissue, because this prevents its attachment to the ulcer. A very ingenious combination of forceps and scissors for the removal of the skin has been H ^ - c- AAp o-tc^v. 13^ ------ C —• V rl turn ->UxrfTt«vv\.

This strip should be made about a quarter of an inch wide, by two inches long, and should include the upper layers of the derma, with its rete mucosum. This is enough to make several grafts—which should be about one-eighth by one-quarter inch in size. Those first used were very small; and while grafts the size of the finger-nail will usually <rrow« better results are attained, if the same amount of tissue is distributed in smaller sections. The surface of the sore, which must be healthy and bright, should be thoroughly cleansed with moist lint until the mucus which covers it is removed ; and the nicer appears dry and raw. On this surface, without cutting or scraping, as was formerly done, the first row of grafts, their cut surfaces looking downwards, should be placed half an inch from the edge of the wound. A second row may be placed the same distance beyond the first. Thus arranged, both the graft and edges of the ulcer grow rapidly ; and unite before the stimulated granulations rise and prevent healing, which they * Gaz.

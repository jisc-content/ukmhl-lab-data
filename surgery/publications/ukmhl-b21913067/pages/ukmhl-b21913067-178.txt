He was put upon good, nourishing food, and carbonate of lithia, gr. ii., t. i. d., was prescribed. Under this treatment the patient improved rapidly in strength, and he was apparently in good health at the end of four weeks ; but the enlargement of the joints and tumors on hand did not diminish in the least. Surgical interference was now deemed proper. In the meantime, Dr. Longstreth had examined fluid taken from the tumor on the dorsal surface of hand by an exploring needle, and found a large amount of the crystals of nitrate of soda. On the first of July Dr. Lewis made a free incision in the tumor on the dorsum of right hand, and allowed a free discharge of a white chalky substance. On the second day after the operation, the tissues surrounding the wound becoming red and swollen, with some pain, lead water and laudanum were applied. The inflammation soon subsided, and the wound healed rapidly. The enlargements on the fingers were ti’eated in the same manner, with good result, with the exception of the enlargement on little finger of the left hand. Pure carbolic acid was injected into this without good result, free incision being the only treatment that was attended with success. On the 22d of July the patient was discharged, to all appearance cured.

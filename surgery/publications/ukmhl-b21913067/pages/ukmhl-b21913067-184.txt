Many other subjects of greater interest might have been chosen from sections now in the labora- tory, for after ten years or more of work in the teaching of practical microscopy in the laboratory of a medical school, one learns to simplify methods and make improvements, and to bring within the range of accomplishment many things hitherto beyond the reach of the student, because of the time required for their preparation and study. In this work I have been greatly assisted by mv friend and assistant, Dr. S. G. Shanks, of Albany. I am also greatly indebted to my friend, C. E. Beecher, of X. Y. State Museum, Albany, in the preparation of the drawings. There are many other points of interest in this section, which an inspection of the Figs, will exhibit.

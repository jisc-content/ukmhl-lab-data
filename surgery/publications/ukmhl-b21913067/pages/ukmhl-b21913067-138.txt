ILLUSTRATED MEDICINE AND SURGERY. [ 80 ] described. Fig. 78 shows to what extent the patient leaned to one side after a carefnl application of the jacket. Fig. 79, from a photograph taken ten minutes afterward and with the elastic cord tightened, shows how effectually it corrected the lateral distortion due to muscular weakness. It will be seen that the elastic cord does not restrict the movements of the patient. After stooping, or bending to one side, the patient, instead of resuming the faulty position shown in Fig. 78, remains as in Fig. 79. This sin pie mechanical adjuvant to the plaster jacket proved a complete success, not only in its immediate but its permanent elfects. Some two months afterward the patient returned to my office, and had recovered so much strength in the weakened muscles, by their daily exercise, that he was able, without the aid of the jacket, or other artificial support, to stand quite as erect, as in Fig. 79.

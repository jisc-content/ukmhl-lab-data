APPARATUS FOR TREATING FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. r 128 ] This apparatus has the following advantages : 1. The force of gravitation is utilized for keeping the fragments in apposition, and is applied in such a way as not to cease acting. 2. The patient can move about in bed to a considerable extent, and not interfere with the proper action of the retentive forces; and this affords great relief, as I have more than once seen. 3. The limb will not be excoriated by its contact with the hammock on which it rests. 4. There will be no material interference with the blood supply to the fragments of the patella, and so delay union. 5. The leg will be left free, so that passive motion can be made at the ankle-joint from time to time: also passive motion can be made at the knee-joint in such a manner as not to interfere with union, and so as not to make anchylosis so imminent.

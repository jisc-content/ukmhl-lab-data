[ 89 ] EXTRANEOUS MICROSCOPIC MATTER IN ANIMAL FLUIDS. BY E. P. BREWER, M.D., PH.D., Of Norwich, Conn., Late Surgeon to Hartford Hospital, Conn. In the microscopy of solids little difficulty is experienced from the admixture of foreign matter, but in the examination of fluids where its features are made up of a large number of suspended ele- ments, and, further, is exposed to contamination by deposits from the air, and in the transfer from vessel to vessel, we frequently meet with diverse and perplexing substances, calling forth considerable labor for their differentiation from the correct elements of our specimen. When encompassed by these difficulties our enthusiasm, I fear, sometimes falters, and we regard microscopy, in ease of acquisition at least, as Huxley did Bathybias, failing to fulfill the promise of its youth ; however, with perseverance the shadows fall behind, and are forgotten in the advance of the bright light of victory. The drawings of Fig. 88 represent the most common of extraneous matter met with in fluids. Some of them, as cotton (b) and woollen fibre, (o) are almost constantly present, and thus become familiar to the microscopist in the early part of his career. Their characters are so decided that they seldom give the least difficulty in identity. Cot- ton fibres (b) are generally long, much twisted, and marked with lines confusingly interlacing, so that no definite repetition of structure is apparent; the diameter is irregular, both in the same and different specimens, though generally large; per- haps, in their extremes, from to Hrg-; in the ends are frayed out and the fibres dis- cordantly arranged. Woollen fibre (<?) pre- sents a striking contrast with cotton fibre. Its dull, pearly lustre, distinct, scale-like markings, long, graceful curves, large diameter, and nearly square broken ends, separate it widely from all other extraneous matter. Flax fibre (a) will seldom give trouble from its resemblance to Fig. 88.

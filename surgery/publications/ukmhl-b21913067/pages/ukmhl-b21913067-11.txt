PREFACE. To every one familiar with foreign Hospital Reports and Society Transactions, the value of illustrated articles is evident. While in this country there is no dearth of medical literature, it must be admitted that many of the rare and interesting cases, especially of a surgical or pathological nature, including methods of treatment, are imperfectly reported, or remain unrecorded, in consequence of the great expense attend- ing the production of satisfactoiy illustrations. It is the object of this volume to meet this defect. By means of photographs from life, chromo-lithographs of drawings from nature, and engravings of the highest artistic excellence, much valuable and instructive ma- terial from our most eminent professors and practitioners has been brought within the reach of the Profession, which has heretofore been withheld, or published at personal expense. The cases presented, in matter and illustrations, are original contributions to this work, and have been liberally paid for and copyrighted. George Henry Fox. Frederic R. Sturgis.

DISLOCATION OF THE COLUMN Alt CARTILAGE OF THE NOSE. The second case was of a gentleman of this city, and differed in no especial manner from the first, except that the dislocation was to the left, which would suggest a probable explanation of the affection. In the first case the gentleman was left-handed, while in the latter he was right-handed. Probably the deformity was caused, primarily, by pressure of the thumb in using the handkerchief. Subsequently, as the nostril became partially closed, more vigorous efforts at clearing the occluded passage would be attempted by closing the opposite side by the thumb, and thereby the deformity be aggravated. The operation in each was the same, and consisted in the removal of the cartilage. This was done by making an incision along the edge of the protruding mass with a gum lancet, which I found to answer an admirable purpose, and dissecting down until it was sufficiently cleared to enable me to seize it with a pair of rat-tooth forceps. The dissection was then easily completed, and the cartilage extracted. A small elliptical piece of redundant muco-cutaneous membrane was then cut out with a pair of scissors, and the wound closed with two fine sutures. In each case the parts healed by first intention, the sutures being removed on the second day. No anaesthetic was used, and the operation was not especially painful. The results were eminently satisfactory, the deformity being completely removed, and absolute symmetry restored. L 20 ]

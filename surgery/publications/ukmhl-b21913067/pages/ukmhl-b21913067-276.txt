[ 162 ] CANCER OF BREASTâ€”ULCERATION AND DISSEMINATED NODULES. BY GEORGE HENRY FOX, M.D, Physician to the Neiv York Skin and Cancer Hospital. The accompanying plate is presented as an illustration of cancerous ulceration with disseminated, hemispherical nodules, some of which are undergoing central atrophy. The patient, who was brought to my clinic at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, was -18 years of age, and gave the following brief history. Two years previously the disease began as a small, hard, rounded lump in the left breast above the nipple. An enlarged gland in the axilla soon followed. These tumors were injected by a physician a year and a half later, and shortly after ulcerated. New nodules now appeared with great rapidity on the breast and arm. Many of these ulcerated and coalesced until the axilla became one large irregular ulcer, as is seen in the plate. The borders of this ulcer were hard and raised, and its base presented a dull red glazed appearance. The disseminated nodules were indurated and freely movable with the skin. They were located chiefly in the vicinity of the axillary ulcer, but a few were scattered over the arm. In this case the nipple was unaffected. The disease was very painful, but unfortunately beyond the stage in which permanent relief might be afforded by surgical measures. The patient died about three months after the drawing was made.

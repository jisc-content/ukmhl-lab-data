[ 158 ] DOUBLE CONGENITAL DISLOCATION OF THE HIP. BY HENRY B. SANDS, M.D., Professor of the Practice of Surgery in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York City, etc. The patient, a girl, aged IT, was admitted into Bellevue Hospital in June, 1872. She had always been deformed, and had occasionally suffered from pain in the right knee during locomotion. Usually she could walk rapidly, and without difficulty; although she had a waddling gait, and exhibited the characteristic rolling motion of the pelvis. Examination showed that on each side, the head of the femur was dislocated backward and upward on the dorsum ilii. The movements of flexion, extension, and rotation were free. Traction on the lower limbs increased their length by drawing the heads of the femora toward the acetabula; but the displacement returned as soon as the force was withheld. Ho treatment was advised. The photographs illustrate the characteristic deformity. 1. Each trochanter is seen to be unu- sually prominent, and to be situated much nearer the iliac crest than when in its normal position. Owing to their projection, the width of the pelvis appears considerably increased. 2. The centre of motion at the junction of the pelvis with the femur being behind the line of gravity, the pelvis is depressed, or inclined forward. 3. To compensate for the obliquity of the pelvis, the lumbar vertebrae present an antero-posterior curvature, with its convexity forward, constituting lordosis, while another compensatory curve is seen in the dorsal region, having its convexity backward. In the present case a slight degree of lateral spinal curvature is also observed. This is due to the fact that the lower limbs were of unequal length, one being displaced farther than the other.

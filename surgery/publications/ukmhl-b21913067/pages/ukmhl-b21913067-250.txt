SYPHILITIC STENOSIS OF TITE LARYNX: TRACHEOTOMY. [ 148 ] At that time the voice could not be raised above a whisper, and respiration wTas somewhat stridulous. Treatment was pursued with gradual improvement until March 1881, a period of nine months, when the patient passed from observation. The patient again came to my notice at the Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital in January 1883, when the condition seen in the accompanying plates was found. Fig. 142. The voice is whispering and nasal, resembling that of a person with cleft palate. The vocal cords are not visible, except for a very limited extent at their anterior extremities. Phonation seems to be largely performed by the ventricular bands, which are excessively thickened. There is no ap- parent loss of tissue in the larynx. The act of swallowing is now accomplished with ease. Up to six months ago, however, liquids would occasionally regurgitate through the nose, or trickle into the larynx. In general condition there has been great improvement, and there has been no recurrence of laryngeal obstruction. Specific treatment has been entirely suspended since March 1881, no symp- toms of syphilis having developed.

55 An irritable constitution is most prone to inflammation ; and, when produced in it, is more dangerous and extensive. Some persons are naturally irritable, others become so from disease. Thus, in fever, when the constitu- tion has suffered much, the parts on which the body rests become inflamed and mortify. But in fractures, where the system is healthy and vigorous, although the patient remains many weeks in bed, no such effects are produced. Where there is great irritability, inflamma- tion is always dangerous; the application of a blister to the chest of a child, for the re- moval of a cough after measles, frequently, in this town, destroys life, by producing gan- grene. So mercury, by rendering the body irritable, disposes it to inflammation ; and it is wrong to operate on a patient immediately after a mercurial course on account of this in- flammatory tendency The exciting causes of inflammation are, whatever produces an unnatural state of a part, calling upon nature for its reparation, *' A young woman in our Hospital, who had passed through a course of mercury, had a fatty tumour removed, and died of erysipelatous inflammation, brought on by this simple operation. A man had a musket ball extracted from his arm whilst under a course of mercury, and had severe erysipelas produced in consequence. E 4 Exciting causes.

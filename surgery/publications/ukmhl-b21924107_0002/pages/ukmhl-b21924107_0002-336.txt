The man said, You may do what you like; I am no judge, but you are; so do what you please with me.” Accordingly he walked into the operating theatre to be trephined; the portion of bone was removed; he walked back again to bed, and never had a bad symptom * February 1823, John Mahoney, aet. 30, an Irish la- bourer^ was brought into St. Thomas’s Hospital, having been struck by the end of a bar of iron on his head: the blow stunned him for a few minutes. On examination, I found a compound fracture of the right parietal bone, a little above its centre, with depression of the fractured portion, in extent about the size of a crown piece, the greater part of which was below the inner table of the sound bone. The patient was perfectly sensible, and only complained of slight pain at the seat of the injury. He walked into the operating theatre, where I removed the whole of the depressed part of the bone, which was much comminuted. The dura mater was sound, and the haemor- rhage very trifling. After the operation, he was freely purged, was ordered low, light diet, and kept very quiet, and merely cold water applied on linen to the wound. He rapidly recovered, without any bad symptom, and was discharged at the end of ten weeks, with the wound per- fectly closed; but the pulsation of the brain could be dis- tinctly felt, as soft matter occupied the place of the bone which I had removed. During the progress of the cure he was only bled three times. He wears a metal plate over the part at which the bone is deficient, but this is gradually becoming firmer, and the pulsation less distinct.

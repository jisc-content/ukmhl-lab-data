When any important organ is directly in- jured, or its functions are disturbed in conse- quence of the influence of the injury upon the constitution, the treatment must be neces- sarily constitutional. No vital organ can be deranged in its functions, without producing a general disturbance in the system; and this will be greater or less, in proportion to the importance of the part injured, the extent of the injury, and the nature of the personâ€™s constitution. The most powerful constitutional means of relieving inflammation is, by the abstrac- tion of blood. Its beneficial effects princi- pally result from its producing a diminution of nervous power; and that it does so, is proved by the syncope which it occasions. Sometimes the removal of a very small quan- tity of blood will occasion not only suspension of all the voluntary functions, but of the mental powers. Constitu- tional or local. Bleeding.

311 from the accident, and advised him to keep particularly quiet and sober. On the 20th of January 1822, exactly six months from the receipt of the injury, he had an epileptic fit; Mr. H. was called to visit him, and recommended the same plan of treatment. The fits, however, returned once or twice every fortnight; and oftener, if he exerted himself, or was guilty of any excess. Mr. H. told him, that he could not be cured without having the depressed portion of bone removed; to which he was averse, and came to town to consult me, when I confirmed the opinion of Mr. H. The patient still refused to undergo any operation at that period. The fits increased in frequency; and on the 30th of July 1822, having had two, he became much alarmed, and sent for Mr. Hemsted to remove the portion of depressed bone, which Mr. H. did with a trephine. He speedily recovered from the operation, and has not since had any return of the epileptic fits. Another circumstance I shall mention; and whether we regard it in a physiological or surgical point of view, it is perhaps one of the most extraordinary which ever oc- curred ; and as connected with surgery and physiology, I am surprised that it has not made a greater impression on the public mind than it appears to have done.

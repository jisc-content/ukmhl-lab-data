343 OF THE OPERATION OP TREPHINING. This operation will be required under the following circumstances. 1st. Where there is extravasation of blood between the dura mater and skull, 2d. In fractures of the skull, with symp- toms of compression continuing after deple- tion. 3d. In simple fractures with depression and continued symptoms of compression. 4th. In compound fracture with depres- sion, unattended with symptoms of compres- sion, it is best to trephine, or to raise the depressed bone by the elevator. 5th. When matter has formed. It generally happens in these last cases, when matter is seated between the dura mater and skull, that there is fracture; and this is an indication of the seat of the injury which has been done to the brain, it is also fol- lowed by rigors and other symptoms, which indicate its presence ; still it would be right, in cases in which there is no fracture, and the other symptoms, rigors, &c. are present, to penetrate the bone, to see whether matter is lodged between it and the dura mater. When an abscess is placed beneath the dura mater, I have never seen a case recover from . z 4 Circum- stances ren- deritjg the operation necessary.

178 Parts repro- duced. of the cicatrix; and unfortunately it was a deformity incapable of being remedied by any means which art could suggest. I have never seen a case like that represented in the plas- ter bust on the table, where the chin is united firmly to the breast, which was capable of being cured. There are some parts of the body, however, in which deformities of this kind may be removed; as in cases in which the thigh is united to the abdomen; where the bridle of skin may be divided, and the joint afterwards straightened; but where the bridle is broad, and not separated from the muscles, as under the chin, no operation wiU, avail *. In the formation of cicatrices, the original parts may all be reproduced, except two. In the first place, new skin, though differing somewhat in texture and smoothness, is still a substance similar to the original skin. Skin may be defined to be a substance producing rete mucosum and cuticle. Are both pro- duced by the newly formed skin? Undoubt- edly. The cuticle is produced very quickly; * When the cicatrix is not very extensive, and is pro- ducing much deformity, or impeding the motions of a joint, Mr. Earle has proposed that it should be removed by tlie knife, and a case is related in the fifth vol. of the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, in which he performed this ope- ration with success.

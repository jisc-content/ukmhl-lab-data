345 parietal bone; the first on account of the artery of the dura mater, which penetrates there the parietal bone; and under the second, the lateral sinus is situated. If depression oc- curs at any of these points, the trephine must be applied at a little distance. Fractured portions of bone may be often raised by the elevator; and I may observe here, that this is the instrument I recom- mend in cases in which it can be employed without the use of the trephine. The saw which Mr. Hey has recommend- ed may be useful in removing an angle of bone, to admit the elevator. The mode of trephining is as follows: you are called to a case, in which there is a wound of the scalp, with fracture and depression of the bone ; you introduce your finger into the wound, in order to ascer- tain the extent of the depression. If neces- sary, you then enlarge the wound, in the direction of the fracture; and if the depres- sion be extensive, you should make a crucial incision, and turn aside the integuments from the part at which you intend to apply the tre- phine, cut through the pericranium, and se- parate it from that part of the bone on which the crown of the trephine will act. The pin of the trephine is to be pushed down, and placed on the sound bone, as near to its fractured Elevator to be used alone, if possible. Keyâ€™s saw. Mode of peiforming the opera- tion.

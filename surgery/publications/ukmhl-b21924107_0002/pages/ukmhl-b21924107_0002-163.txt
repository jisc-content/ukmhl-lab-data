So in an abscess of the liver, the matter is discharged, not through the skin, which is a more remote surface, but into the cavity of the stomach or intestines, which may be con- sidered as the nearest outlets, from which it is thrown up by vomiting, or discharged with the faeces. These effects are produced in the following manner: the surface of the abscess becoming united with a portion of intestine or stomach by the adhesive process, the ulcerative action commences; by which a communication is formed between these surfaces, and the matter is discharged in the manner before mentioned, without danger, or with less danger to life. The same thing happens in absorption of the bones. Thus, in ulceration of the tibia, the matter breaks through the skin; on that surface which is only covered by skin and peri- osteum. This is a law in some degree depend- ing on the greater irritability of those parts which are nearest the surface of the body. The most external surfaces of the body are more irritable, and more subject to vicissitudes of action from corresponding changes of tempe- rature than other parts of the body, and they give way to ulceration more readily than those which are more deeply seated, and pos- K 3

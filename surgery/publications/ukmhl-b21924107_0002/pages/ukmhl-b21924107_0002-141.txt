Ill trate the skin only, avoiding the ligament; apply a piece of lint over it wetted in the patientâ€™s blood, and strips of adhesive plaster over the lint. A roller is to be gently bound round the knee, and to be kept constantly wet with the liq. plumb, acet. c spir. vini; and a splint is to be placed behind the joint to preserve perfect rest. In cases in which the constitution is de- stitute of vigour, the adhesive inflammation is sometimes so deficient, that immense abscesses are formed from their not being bounded by adhesion; and I recollect having seen in a poor hypochondriac the back nearly covered by an abscess to which adhesion had not formed bounds. In hare-lip it is by the adhesive inflamma- tion the wound becomes united, and the hor- ^ rible deformity is removed. The effusion of adhesive matter, by un- loading the vessels of the part, has the effect of reducing the inflammation; so that the process generally terminates as soon as this effect is produced. The great facility with which many of the soft parts unite by adhesion, has led to the application of this principle for the reparation or restoration of some portions which have : been destroyed by disease, or designedly mu- tilated.

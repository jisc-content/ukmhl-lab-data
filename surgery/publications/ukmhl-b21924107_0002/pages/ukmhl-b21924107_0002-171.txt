141 the ulcerative process; a space being thus pro- duced for the effusion of matter occasioned by the second stage of inflammation. A drop of matter is, at first, secreted into the cavity; and as soon as it is poured out, its pressure occasions an increase of the ulcerative process which adds to the cavity previously formed; fresh matter is then produced, and the sur- rounding solids ulcerating, it is accumulated, but it excavates chiefly on the side towards the skin, and very little in the opposite direc- tion ; a circumstance which shows that mat- ter has no power of corroding, as was for- merly supposed, when it was thought that matter acted chemically on the solids like an acid or alkali. Abscesses are dangerous, according to the following circumstances. First, from their size. â€¢ It is not, however, the quantity of matter produced which ren- ders them dangerous; but the difficulty which nature, has in repairing the devastation made by excavation of the solids, from the pressure of the matter. An abscess may contain a great quantity of matter, and the constitution may have been scarcely affected by it; but very soon after it is opened, the constitution begins to suffer. It is not, therefore, the quantity of matter, but the process of restoration after the evacuation Danger of abscesses: From their size.

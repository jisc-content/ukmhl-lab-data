150 Treatment of chronic abscesses. The treatment of chronic abscess is very different from the acute. In the last case, you wish to diminish the state of excitement in the constitution; and, in the former, you do all you can to give it additional powers, by allowing a generous diet and giving the ammonia and bark: the ammonia is the me- dicine on which the principal reliance is to be placed. You know that of late bark has not been much used; but we are apt to run into extremes:—bark assists the suppurative process, and a generous diet must be al- lowed in order to increase the action of the parts, by giving tone to the constitution. Stimulant poultices should be applied, and the best I know is the muriate of soda (com- mon salt) and water; a table spoonful of the salt to a pint of water, and the poultice should be wetted with this. Yeast and oat- meal, vinegar and flour, each of these expe- dite the process of suppuration. In indolent cases it is customary to apply stimulant on examination, several tumours, of various sizes, situated on different parts of the cranium, and in two or three of them a distinct feeling of fluctuation; more particularly in the largest, which had formed on the forehead. Although the integument was slightly discoloured, the abscesses entirely disappeared, without the matter being discharged, by the free use of sarsaparilla with minute doses of the oxymuriate of mercury.—T.

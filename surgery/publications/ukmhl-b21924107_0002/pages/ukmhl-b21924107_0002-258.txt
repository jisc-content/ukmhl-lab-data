228 Nature of gangrene. Experiment. artery is enclosed in a sheath, which so far protects it; and its elasticity yielding to the pressure of the bone, enables it to escape in a great majority of cases from being injured by this accident. The nature of gangrene, as far as dissec- tion enables me to judge of it, is this: the excessive action of the part kills the blood vessels, and the blood contained in dead ves- sels becomes coagulated. This is a curious circumstance, which I ascertained by an experiment made on an animal. It is a well known fact in physio- logy, that if a quantity of blood be included in a living vessel between two ligatures, at the distance of two or three inches, this blood remains rather more than three hours before it becomes coagulated. To ascertain whe- ther, if blood were admitted into a dead ves- sel, from which the air was entirely excluded, it would coagulate as it would out of the body, I put a ligature on the jugular vein of a dog, and another ligature at a distance of two inches from the first; then cutting through the vein, I brought it externally to the skin, so that it hung out from the wound for six hours. Having ascertained that the blood coagulates in three hours and a quarter, in a living vessel, I took off one ligature from the dead

If the sinus has existed for a con- siderable time, the oxymuriate of mercury is frequently absorbed, and the mouth becomes affected in the same-manner as if the mercury had been absorbed into the system by rubbing it into the skin, or taking it into the stomach. This proves that old granulating surfaces have the power of receiving by absorption a fluid of this description. I have known what is commonly called the black lotion, which is composed of the liquor calcis, and the submuriate of mercury, when applied to the surface of ulcers, pro- duce an effect upon the mouth in persons who are easily affected by mercury. I believe that the lotion of the liquor calcis and calomel often produces good effects in sores, by the mercurial action which it excites in the system, and not merely by its local effects on the sore to which it is applied.

Thus, arsenic applied to the surfaces of sores is very frequently absorbed into the system; and on this account arsenic is to be regarded as a very dangerous remedy. With respect to the use of arsenic as an internal or external re-

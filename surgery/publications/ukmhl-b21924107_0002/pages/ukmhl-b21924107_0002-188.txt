But what was the consequence ? when the air became absorbed, the adhesive inflammation had not been produced, and the hydrocele returned. Again, experiments have been made on ani- mals; air has been blown into the cellular membrane of a dog; nothing follows but a temporary stiffness, from the distension of the skin; and when the air is absorbed the crackling goes off without adhesive inflam- mation. Dr. Haighton made an ingenious experi- ment, some years ago: he inflated the abdo- men of a dog from an opening in the tunica vaginalis; and this mode of doing it evinced his knowledge; for in the dog, and many other animals, there is a communication with the abdomen from the tunica vaginalis.

211 Occasionally the thickened state of the edges of ulcers impedes the healing process. These edges must be adapted to their surfaces, and this may be done by means of the empl: galban: comp: whicli will remove the indu- rated cuticle, and stimulate the parts to ac- tion ; if this, however, should not succeed, you may use the ungt: hydr: fort: or ungt: lyttse, or you may with a lancet scarify the edges, and this method will often succeed, when every other fails. A blister has an ex- cellent effect. The edges of sores are sometimes very much inverted: a constitutional, as well as local treatment, is then necessary. With re- spect to the local, the application of nitrate of silver to the edges, and the black mercurial wash to the surface of the wound, is gene- rally all that will be required, and the altera- tive medicines I have so often mentioned to you must be regularly given until the ulcer heals. Some sores have their edges very muck evertedy and this affection is commonly symp- tomatic of a malignant diathesis. The usual method of treatment practised in these hos- pitals is, to poultice such ulcers; to attend particularly to the condition of the geneml health, until it is possible the edges have re- sumed a natural and healthy state. p 2 , Ulcers with thickened edgÂ£&.

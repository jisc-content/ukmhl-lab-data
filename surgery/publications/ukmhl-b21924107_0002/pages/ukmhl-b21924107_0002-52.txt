Case. at twelve o’clock on a Monday; at night he spoke to me, when at Lecture, of a pain in his finger and arm; and I advised him to mention it to Dr. Haighton, with whom he lived. On Tuesday he was in considerable pain, which extended up the arm, and he had high febrile symptoms. On Wednesday he was delirious, and died during Wednesday night, or early on Thursday morning. Injuries producing fatal consequences destroy life in three different modes. 1st. When slight, by keeping up a continued constitutional irritation, they gradually wear out the system. 2dly. When more severe, they destroy by occasioning excess of action. 3dly. The most severe, by shock to the nervous system, cause death, without reac- tion. Thus I have seen a person admit- ted into Guy’s Hospital, who had a laden waggon pass over his knee: the bones were crushed, but there was no wound or haemor- rhage, yet the person died in a few hours after his admission. I have also seen a man, who fell into a vat of hot beer, by which both his lower extremities were scalded, but the body escaped any direct injury. This man’s pulse was very small and feeble; his skin was cold; his teeth chattered; no reac- tion took place, and he died in eight hours, notwithstanding stimulants were freely given.

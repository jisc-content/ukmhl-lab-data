64 terwards continued pain in his head, and had considerable constitutional irritation; blood was abstracted from the external jugular vein, and immediately the pain in the head ceased, and did not afterwards return. When you are required to take charge of patients suffering from an injury, which de- mands a length of time for its restoration, you must be exceedingly careful how you take away blood from the system generally, but must in preference adopt local bleeding ; for if, as I have observed, you adopt a system of free depletion, nature will not be equal to the restoration of the injured parts, and the most disastrous consequences follow the indiscri- minate employment of blood-letting. There is not a greater error than this in the practice of surgery*. *■- A stout man was admitted into Guy’s Hospital, having a simple fracture of the tibia, with considerable contusion of the surrounding parts; a day or two after his admission, he had severe constitutional irritation, and acute pain, with spasmodic action of the muscles near the seat of injury. To relieve these symptoms, the dresser was directed to take some blood, from the arm of the pa- tient, which he did; but thinking it proper that faintness should be produced, as a proof of its effect on the consti- tution, and forgetting that the patient was in a recumbent position, he abstracted so large a quantity of blood, that all power of restoration was completely annihilated, and the man died.—^T.

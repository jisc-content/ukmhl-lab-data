We shall now proceed to consider the other mode of union of divided parts; namely, that by granulation; for the two processes which nature institutes for the purpose of filling up ulcers, and for the cure of wounds, are adhe- sion and granulation. A granulation is a newly formed sub- stance, generally red in colour, and having the power of secreting pus. The mode in which a granulation is pro- duced is as follows;â€”it is a process veiy similar to adhesion, but differing from it in one respect.

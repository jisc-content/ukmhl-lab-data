344 Parts on which the trephine must not be applied. trephining for it, although that membrane has been opened for its discharge The operation of trephining used to be of the most complicated kind, requiring several instruments; to learn the names and use of which was of itself a study. It is now simple, and few instruments are necessary. Three will be quite sufficient; viz. a knife with a double edge, in order to separate the pericranium from the bone; an elevator; and a trephine, having a crown; and a pin which will allow of being moved with facility. There are several parts of the skull on which the trephine should not be applied. First, you should never place it on the me- dian line, which extends from above the nose to the tuberosity of the occiput, on account of the intimate connexion between the dura mater and bone; as well as to avoid the longitudi- nal sinus on the fore and upper part, and the perpendicular ridge of the occipital bone at the posterior portion. Over the frontal si- nuses the trephine could not be used with any effect. There are tAvo other points which it is necessary to avoid: the anterior inferior angle, and the posterior inferior angle of the * If the dura mater be punctured, the pia mater should be punctured also, as adliesion will more readily occur.

293 June, 1814, Joseph Constable was brought into Guyâ€™s Hospital, having fallen about twenty feet, on the railing of a house. When admitted, he complained of great pain in his head and shoulder. There was a wound over the right mastoid process, and another on the shoulder, from which he had lost a con- siderable quantity of blood. In the same day he became comatose; purgative medi- cines and injections were administered, by the action of which he appeared a little relieved. On the following day he was deli- rious, and his pulse full and hard: sixteen ounces of blood were taken from the temporal artery, and purgatives again given. The next day he was quite comatose and had the left side paralized; in this state he remained until the following morning, when he died. DISSECTION.

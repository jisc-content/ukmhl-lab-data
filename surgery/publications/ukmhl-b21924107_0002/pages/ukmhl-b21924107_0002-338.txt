308 it happens, that fracture with depression is sometimes not followed bv inflammation, even when the fracture is compound; but we cannot be certain of this; and if it ensue, we cannot save the patient by tre- phining at a late period. The rule, there- fore, which I always follow, is this: When I am called to a compound fracture, with de- pression, which is exposed to view, whether symptoms of injured brain exist or not, I generally use an elevator, and very rarely the trephine. I put this instrument under the bone, raise it, and if it has been comminuted, remove the small portions of bone. The ele- vation of the bone is not followed by any mischief; but if you do not raise it, and in- flammation follows, it will be too late to attempt to save the life of the patient. It sometimes happens, in fracture of the skull, attended with depression, that a small spicula of bone will project into the brain, so as to produce and support epileptic symp- toms. A negro had received a blow on his head with a hammer. He was taken into St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital, having epileptic fits, and he had the appearance of a very slight (depression on his head. Mr. Birch, whose patient he was, trephined him ; and as he was raising the bone, which was effected with great difficulty, the man had a violent epileptic fit. The bone

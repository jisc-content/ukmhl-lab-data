38 Swelling. Termina- tions of in- flammation. Adhesion. It appears also by Mr. Hunter’s experi- ments, that the temperature indicated by the thermometer, when inflammation-was excited in the rectum or vagina of an ass or a dog, was not greater than that existing in an healthy state of those parts. But although no increase of heat is evinced in internal inflammation, yet when the in- flammation is seated on the surface of the body, in which the temperature varies much, and is below 98^^, an alteration sometimes of seven degrees takes place ; as on the inside of the thigh, on which a blister was applied, the thermometer rose to 90°, whilst on the inside of the opposite thigh it only reached 83°: in another instance it rose only 4°, but in every experiment the temperature was increased. 4th. Swelling.—Is occasioned in part by an increased determination of blood to the dis- eased spot, distending the vessels ; but it also depends on effusion of the fibrin of the blood, which, in coagulating, separates a serum into the surrounding cellular tissue. Inflammation has four terminations. 1st. In adhesion. This arises from fibrin being thrown into the cellular membrane, and the parts becoming glued together by it. It had been supposed that , it was albumen which was poured out in inflammation; but in examining this subject with care, it is

Dr. Solander, who was one of the party, particularly cautioned them not to go to sleep, stating that it was ex- tremely dangerous to do so in very cold situa- tions. It happened, however, that the Dr. himself became drowsy, and it was with the greatest difficulty that his companions could ^ keep him in motion ; and it was only by ex- traordinary perseverance that they succeeded in getting him back to the ship alive. Cold therefore, applied generally and gradually for a length of time to a healthy person, diminishes the power of the nervous system, and has the effect of lessening arterial action, both in force and frequency. When cold is applied locally to an in- flamed part, it robs it of its heat, lessens its nervous energy, and diminishes the diame- ter of the vessels; it must be severe if it re- duces the temperature of internal parts be- low 98""; but in this climate many parts of the body, remote from the source of circu- lation, vary in temperature from 20® to 80®: thus, a thermometer applied to the toes when they are cold, will be found to indicate 20°' less of heat than when it is applied to the calf of the leg. Cold applied to excess de-

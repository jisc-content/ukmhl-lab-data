119 from this cause, she was in the most immi- nent danger. The formation of matter in the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum, succeeding the adhesive inflammation, shows the wise provision of that law which renders them prone to the adhesive process. Pus is not, as it was formerly supposed to be, a fluid formed by the dissolution of so- lids, but is produced directly from the blood, changed somewhat in its nature from the action of the blood vessels. That it is not the product of the solids of the part upon which it is pro- duced, is seen in the application of a blister to a surface. For instance, let a blister be applied upon the chest, and the cuticle raised, the serum which is produced, and the fibrin which is poured ^out, be removed in a few hours: inflammation arises upon that surface, ^ and pus is formed on it from the extremities of the exposed vessels. Some little change may take place after the effusion, but the fluid is directly formed from the open extremities of the vessels. On all serous surfaces, as the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum, there is no loss of substance in the largest produc- tions of matter; but, on the contrary, great addition is made to these membranes.

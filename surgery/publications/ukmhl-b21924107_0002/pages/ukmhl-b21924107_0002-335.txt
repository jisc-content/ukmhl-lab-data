305 to the brain, deplete before you trephine; and when it is unattended with such symptoms, though there may be depression, deplete merely, and do not divide the scalp, unless the symptoms have not yielded to depletion. If the fracture be compound, the treatment must be very different; because a compound fracture is followed very generally by inflam- mation of the brain ; and it will be of little use to trephine, when inflammation is once pro- duced. It might be thought that it would be time enough to perform this operation when inflammation had appeared; but this is not the case; for if the inflammation comes on, the patient will generally die whether you trephine or not; and you will not arrest its fatal progress by trephining, but the opera- tion will add to the danger of increasing the inflammation. When inflammation of the dura mater and membranes of the brain has been excited by the depression of the bone, you scarcely retard the progress to death by performing the operation. These principles may be illustrated by many cases. In this Hospital I saw two instances: one in a patient of Mr. Cline, and another in a patient of Mr. Birch. Mr. Clineâ€™s patient was a man who had compound fracture from a blow on the head. A portion of bone had been depressed, and Mr. Cline advised him to VOL. I. X

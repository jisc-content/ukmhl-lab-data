When adhesive matter has been formed, blood vessels soon enter it, and within a short time it becomes organized; the vasa vasorum are elongated, by the force of circulation, and enter the newly formed substance, send- ing out minute ramifications. On cutting into adhesive matter within twenty-four hours after it has been deposited, small bloody spots may be seen, marking the future si- tuation of the vessels which nourish it; but it is not till ten days after it has been formed that any considerable portion of adhesive matter becomes entirely organized; for if injected, you will not completely succeed through every part of the newly formed sub- stance until ten days after the injury, and not even so soon in certain structures When vessels elongate, they have not the * Mr. Hunter relates a case in which the adhesive matter, effused in inflammation, had become organized in twenty-nine hours. He operated on a man for strangu- lated hernia, and the patient died twenty-nine hours after the operation. On examination of the body, he found some adhesive matter (which did not exist at the time the operation was performed) deposited on the portion of in- testine which had been strangulated: very fine injection of different colours was thrown into the arteries and veins of the gut, which also filled the new-formed vessels in the adhesive matter, rendering them perfectly distinct.â€”T.

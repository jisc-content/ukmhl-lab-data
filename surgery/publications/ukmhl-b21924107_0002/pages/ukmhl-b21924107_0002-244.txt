When the serum is discharged, the skin assumes the gangrenous appearance, and becomes perfectly insensible. The vesi- cations extend to parts beyond the ulceration: thus in soies of the leg we frequently see a large portion of the skin giving way, and the gangrenous vesications extending beyond the ulcerated surface.

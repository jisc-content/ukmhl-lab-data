On the day following his admission I was desired to see him ; and I immediately cut away the projecting part of the fungus, and recommended pressure to be made on the part by means of a bandage, applying to the wound a pledget of lint, wetted with lime water. No other treatment was found neces- sary; by these means the fungus was kept down, the ulcer gradually contracted, and on the 9th of August it was nearly skinned over, without one bad symptom occurring during the cure. He always complained of head- ache when the bandage was applied tight. He took no medicine while in the hospital. Mr. Henry, jun. of Keswick, was struck on the forehead by a portion of a small brass cannon, which burst while he w^as firing it; he was immediately afterwards found in a senseless state, but was in a few minutes able to rise and speak. Mr. Edmondstone, sur- geon, was called to see him, and arrived ten minutes after the accident; he found a wound over the left eyebrow, which he enlarged, and then discovered a comminuted fracture of the skull: the fractured portions of bone were loose, and detached; the dura mater was la- cerated, so as to allow of the escape of about a teaspoonful of the substance of the brain.

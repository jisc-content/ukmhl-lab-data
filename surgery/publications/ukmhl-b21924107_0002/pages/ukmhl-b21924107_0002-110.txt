The next mode of relieving inflammation by local remedies is by the application of heat, with moisture; this appears like con- tradiction ; apparently, opposite causes are used to produce the same effect, and it seems to be blowing hot and cold with the same breath ; but it is so. The application of heat alone would be injurious, by increasing ac- tion ; but, when combined with moisture, it is beneficial, by producing relaxation, open- ing the cutaneous pores, and, giving rise to perspiration; thereby removing congestion, and producing nearly similar effects to those which arise from the application of blisters. The effects of heat and moisture combined are well exemplified by what happens when a person takes a warm bath; for instance, a person, whose pulse is at 75®, places himself in a bath, the water of which is heated to 100®; his pulse soon rises to 100®; presently he perspires freely, his pulse becomes less frequent, but soft; great relaxation follows, and, if he were not removed, he would faint, so great is the exhaustion that it occasions. Here then is a direct proof of what heat and moisture produce, when applied generally;

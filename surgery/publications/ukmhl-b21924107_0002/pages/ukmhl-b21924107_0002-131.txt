101 you have had an opportunity of witnessing the fatal consequences of haemorrhage in a case of compound fracture; but if the adhesive process had taken place, haemorrhage would have been prevented, constitutional irritation lessened, and recovery rendered almost sure. It is the same in formidable operations. The Caesarean section, which consists in mak- ing an incision in the course of the linea alba, for the purpose of extracting a foetus from the womb, is not dangerous, if the adhesive process takes place. Its advantage may be exemplified by the operation for cataract: in this operation a wound is made in the eye, more than half of the cornea is cut, the ad- hesive process begins within twelve hours, and in twenty-four the edges of the wound are consolidated. Suppose, on the contrary, they do not adhere, violent inflammation su- pervenes, and the result is destruction to the eye of the patient by suppuration; the success of the operation depends then on the adhe- sive process. In a person who has been in â€¢ill health, the inflammation may be too weak, and in another case it might be too strong; suppuration would be the conse- quence in both instances: thus the same effect results, though produced by very dif- ferent causes. Again, in the operation for strangulated hernia, an opening is made into In opera- tions.

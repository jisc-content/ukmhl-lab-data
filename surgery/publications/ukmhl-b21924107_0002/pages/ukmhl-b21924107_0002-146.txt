116 Parts prone to suppura- tion. The ure- thra. Trachea. Nasal mem- brane and lachrymal canal. The an- trum. Joints. Some parts of the body are very prone to the suppurative inflammation, so that in them suppuration seems to precede the adhesive process; a slight degree of inflammation, producing suppuration, or a higher degree of it, adhesion. Mr. Hunter first observed this circumstance. The urethra, when it has irritation pro- duced in it from the introduction of a bougie, frequently suppurates, but very rarely ad- heres. The trachea, if it inflames, generally sup- purates, although the adhesive inflammation does sometimes occur in it. The lining membrane of the nose, if it in- flames, easily suppurates, the mucous becomes first of a yellow colour, and then pus is se- creted. The lachrymal sac and duct very generally suppurate, under inflammation; and hence the disease is called fistula lachryma- lis, from the suppuration proceeding to ul- ceration, and the matter being discharged through the fore part of the cheek. The antrum maxillare and the frontal sinuses also readily suppurate under inflam- mation. When joints inflame, the internal surface of the ligament which secretes the synovia is more disposed to the suppurative than to the adhesive inflammation, on account of its mu-

137 who was an observing man^ though he knew nothing of otir profession, that the men who had ulceration before, were attacked with ulcers in the same parts; and if their bones had been formerly fractured, they became dis- united. This does not excite surprise, because we know that scurvy produces the ulcerative process, attacking the gums, causing profuse bleeding, &c.; that the ulcerative process has a stronger disposition towards parts newly formed, and that in this case, therefore, it appeared in parts where ulcers had formerly healed, and in disunited limbs where callus had previously formed. When the men ob- tained fresh vegetables^ &c. on shore, they re- covered their health; their bones united, and their sores healed. There cannot be a better example than this, to show the readiness with which newly-formed parts ulcerate, when com- pared with the original organs of the body. The parts more remote from the heart ul- cerate more readily than those in the vicinity of it. This circumstance led me to say, that when the vital action is feeble, and the power of the circulation diminished, we find a greater disposition to the ulcerative process than otherwise. Thus for one ulcer in the arm, we find twenty in the lower extremities; and it can- not but have been observed in going through Parts re- mote from the heart more rea- dily ulce- rate.

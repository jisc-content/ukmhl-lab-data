307 A short time after, a patient tinder Mr. Birch, with fracture and depression, was told that he was in a similar danger, and advised to uli^ dergo the same operation. He was^ however, self-willed, and obstinately refused to submit to the operation. Several days after the acci- dent he was seized with pain in the head^ and symptoms of inflammation in the brain; and when he became insensible^ the operation of trephining was performed; but it did not arrest the symptoms, and he died of the inflamma- tion. In Guy’s Hospital two boys were admit- ted under very similar circumstances. The Os frontis had, in one case, been broken by a kick from a horse, and in the other by a fall on the forehead. In one case the portion of bone Was raised, and the boy did well: but the mother of the other boy interfered to pre- vent the operation of trephining; and though it was performed after symptoms of inflam- mation had appeared, he died. It is true. had been struck with a hammer by addderit on the supe- rior part of the frontal bone to the left of the median line. The blow had produced a compound fracture, with depres- sion, in extent about the size of an half-crown. He was perfectly sensible, and Said he only felt a soreness at the injured part. I reihoved the whole of the fractured bone, which was comminuted; one small portion had penetrated the dura mater. He has since been treated exactly as the former patient was, and has not had a bad symptom since. (Sept. 20.) He has been bled twice.—-T.

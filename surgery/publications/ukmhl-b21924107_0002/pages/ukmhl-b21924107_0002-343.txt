He was discharged cured from the Hospital, on the 10th of July. The exact mode in which his accident had happened I could not learn; but he was found on board his ship in a state of insensibility, and was taken to Gibraltar, and to Deptford, in this state of deprivation of mental faculties and bodily power *. It appears, therefore, that in cases of de- pression, we should not be prevented from trephining, however distant the period may be at which the accident occurred, if there be no inflammation ; and the patient may, after a great interval, be restored to the powers of body and mind. * Mr. Cline may, perhaps, be able to add circum* stances, which I have omitted in the relation of this case.

16 Case. Case. sionally result from slight local injury. Dr. Ludlow^ of Caine, pricked his hand with a thorn in shooting, and died of tetanus in a few days. I was called to see a young gentle- man who had been thrown into a hedge, by which his hand was lacerated; in seven days he had symptoms of tetanus, and on the ninth day he died. A man, who lived intemperately, was bled on Tuesday, by the late Mr. Saunders; on the Wednesday he. invited some friends to composed and sane : the porter was continued daily, with a few ounces of wine; the sloughing of the stump stopped, and he rapidly recovered. Charles Gordon, set. 40, applied at the surgery of St. Thomas’s Hospital for advice, on account of severe in- flammation of the arm, w’hich had arisen from a slight con- tused wound on the elbow. On examining the arm I found that inflammation of a phlegmonous character, attacking the cellular tissue, extended from the carpus to the shoul- der; this had produced excessive constitutional suffering; his tongue was very foul, his bowels affected with diarrhoea, his pulse very rapid, his countenance anxious, and his skin hot and dry. I had him immediately admitted into the hospital, and ordered medicines to allay the constitutional irritation, and to check the diarrhoea; nevertheless in the evening he became delirious. On the following morning I learnt that he had been accustomed to take considerable quantities of spirits daily; in consequence of which I di- rected he should have some gin (his favourite liquor). Soon after taking the first quantity he became much more tran- quil ; it was, therefore, repeated, and produced as good effects as the porter in the former case.—T.

109 so that these are the principles by which you are to be directed* The adhesive process is useful in the for- mation of cysts. Balls encysted, have been known to remain in the body for many years. Morgagni, if I rightly recollect, mentions a case, in which he found a ball lodged in a cyst in the lungs. You see by this prepara- tion how complete is the cyst, and being little irritable, the ball remains in a quiescent state for the rest of life. If the ball be not encyst- ed, it travels, by absorption of the parts through which it passes. Another very important use of adhesive inflammation is, that of its dividing cavities into distinct parts, by which means it fixes a boundary to the suppurative process; thus the cavity of the abdomen becomes divided into two, by the elFusion of adhesive matter on the surface of the colon, by which it is glued to the peritoneum. In abscesses a cyst is formed by the adhesive process round the matter, and prevents its escape into the sur- rounding cellular tissue. The advantage of adhesive inflammation is admirably shown in wounds in the joints. So soon as the knee joint is opened the syno- via escapes, the person feels faint, looks pale, and the constitution appears to have received a severe shock. The wound endangers the

159 flating the cellular tissue beneath the integu- ment before flaying: the man himself men- tioned it afterwards as a good joke. What takes place when a lung is wounded and air is admitted into the cavity of the chest ? The air inspired enters into the cel- lular tissue, the face and body become bloated; but it is afterwards removed by absorption, without producing any inflam- mation. He who holds that the admission of air produces the irritation attending the open- ing of abscesses, takes a narrow and par- tial view of the case; for the cause of the irritation is as follows : If a wound be made into any cavity of the body, be lt an abscess or a natural cavity, soon after the vessels of the part are divided, inflammation arises to heal the wound, whether it be exposed to the air or not. If it heal by adhesion, the influence is slight and directly terminates; but if the adhesive inflammation be insufficient or im- perfect, then a suppurative inflammation fol- lows, and granulations arise, which process produces violent influence both upon the part ' and constitution. The cause is, therefore, the division of the blood vessels, and not the presence of air; and its degree depends upon the ease or difficulty with which the injury is repaired. 4

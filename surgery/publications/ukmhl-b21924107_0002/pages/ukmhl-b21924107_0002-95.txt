65 The second mode of relieving inflamma- tion, is by restoring the secretions ; for when- ever inflammation occurs, at least in a violent degree, all the secretions are diminished or suppressed. The most important secretions are those of the liver, intestines, skin, and kidneys; and when these cease to perform their proper functions, irritative fever is the consequence. A deficiency of secretion from the alimentary canal is the cause of a great number of the diseases to which human beings are subject. The internal surface of the in- testines is lined by glands; the tube itself is on an average twenty-seven feet in length, and three inches at least in circumference; so there are here near one thousand inches of surface, from which, in health, continual se- cretion proceeds. What, then, must be the result of allowing so extensive a secreting sur- face to remain inactive? the production and continuance of constitutional irritation. To excite the intestinal canal, and to restore its action, is, therefore, one of your principal ob- jects ; this may be done by purgatives. Pur- gatives afford relief in nearly the same man- ner as the abstraction of blood from the arm; for a pint of serum will pass off with the faeces, after taking a brisk cathartic. Purgatives have likewise another excellent influence, independently of restoring the in- VOL. I. F Secretions restored. Purgatives,

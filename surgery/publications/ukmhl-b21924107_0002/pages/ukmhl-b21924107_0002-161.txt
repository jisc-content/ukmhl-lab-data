131 cerated part, it looks as if it were worm- eaten; the surface is rough and very irre- gular. Sometimes a very considerable portion of the body is removed by ulceration. Here is an example, on the table, of an ulcerated tibia. See to what an extent ulceration has removed not only the cancellated structure of the bone, but the shell in which that structure is contained. Flere is another example in which a great part of the tibia has been re- moved; the ulceration has extended six or seven inches, so that little more than the fibula remains: such is the power of the ab- sorbent vessels of feeding upon the body and upon themselves. The ulcerative process is sometimes ex- tremely rapid in its progress; as much of the body will be destroyed in a few hours, as it will require weeks and months to repair. In proportion to the extent of surface de- stroyed will be the difficulty with which that surface is closed. Something will depend also on the form of the ulceration, and the kind of surface exposed; but the general rule is, that the difficulty of the restorative process is pro- portional to the extent of surface destroyed. It is a curious law with respect to ulcera- tion, that it has a tendency to the nearest ex- ternal surface. This is a law which is at- K 2 Extent of ulceration, Its rapid extension.

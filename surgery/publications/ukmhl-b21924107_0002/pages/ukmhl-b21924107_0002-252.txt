Bones, at last, become separated; but this process is very slow, loaded as they are with phosphate of lime. Hence we are often under the necessity of taking away bones, when the process of separation is, in other re- spects, complete. I am anxious, whenever I have an opportunity in these lectures, to refer you to cases actually existing in the hospitals; and you cannot have a better opportunity of observing the process of nature with respect to the separation of bones, than in the case of popliteal aneurism, to which I have before directed your attention. This man underwent the operation for aneurism in the other hos- pital. The aneurismal bag had been loaded with fluid blood for a length of time; the process of gangrene commenced at the ankle, all the soft parts were absorbed, and there is nothing now remaining but a portion of bone, which will also separate, if we permit it to do so, by the efforts of nature alone. I knew a person in the country from which I came (Norfolk), whose leg entirely separated by the process of ulceration. In the foot.this very commonly takes place; in the calf of the leg it is not common, but below the calf it fre- quently occurs.

250 with starch, and if gangrene be produced apply a port wine poultice, or the nitrous acid lotion, in the proportion of a drachm of the undiluted acid to a quart of water. Fomen- tations and emollient poultices relax the parts, and dispose to gangrene * Mr. Copeland Hutchison has advised incisions in the gangrene of erysipelas. There is anotlier form of inflammation, which I shall term cellular, as it appears to be principally situated in that texture. I mention it here, as it is sometimes con- founded with true erysipelas, and because it so fre- quently terminates in gangrene. It is usually situated in the extremities, and is often produced from very trifling injury. I have seen five cases within these last two years in which it arose from slight injury to the elbow, occasion- ed by the persons falling on the olecranon. Shortly after the accident, pain is experienced at the wound, and the surrounding parts become swelled, from effusion into the cellular tissue, but the integument is scarcely discoloured; this swelling extends gradually, so as to cover the whole of the extremity in a few days. Constitutional symptoms now arise, the patient is restless, anxious, and has occasional rigors, succeeded by heat; the skin becomes partially discoloured, and on these parts vesicles are formed, which burst, and expose gangrenous spots beneath: when these spots separate, the cellular tissue is found also to be gangrenous, not only the portion thus exposed, but that likewise which is situated to a con- siderable extent beneath the surrounding integument. By the subsequent separation of this substance the connexion

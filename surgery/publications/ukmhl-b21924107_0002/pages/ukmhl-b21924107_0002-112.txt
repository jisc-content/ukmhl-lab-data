To some persons^ and in some situations, however, the application of leeches is attended with very great inconvenience*; as, forex- ample, when the testis is inflamed, it is of considerable importance to some persons that bleeding from this part should be concealed; in such a case, to avoid the inconvenience of the application of leeches, and the expo- sure consequent on the after bleeding, it is better to puncture some of the distended vessels on the scrotum with a lancet, keeping the patient in the erect position; you may in this way get away any quantity of blood you wish; and what is of great consequence you can stop the bleeding when you please, * In many persons, when leeches are applied, they cause a kind of erysipelatous inflammation, rarely of a dangerous nature, but producing considerable inconve- nience and disfigurement. In such cases they afford little or no relief, and, therefore, should never be used. If applied over parts which contain much loose cellular tissue, as the palpebr0e, or the scrotum, an ecchymosis is a frequent consequence: this is a great objection to their being used to the exterior of the palpebrae in persons who are particular about their appearance.â€”T.

7 extract it and the disease will quickly disap- pear, the cause of irritation being removed. Many cases of this kind have fallen under my observation, and I will relate a few of them by way of illustration. Some years since, two persons came to case, consult me from the same town (not knowing each otherâ€™s situation or intention) ; each of them had an abscess near the alveolar pro- cesses ; which, on examination, I found ex- tensive, and it had produced an opening through the cheek. The disease had been of long standing in both cases, and occasional pain was experienced in the surrounding parts of the jaw; I directed a diseased tooth, near the ulcer, to be drawn; which being done, the patients quickly recovered. A lady was for a long period afflicted with case, a fungoid granulation, which protruded through an ulcerated opening in the cheek: she tried for several months every remedy that was recommended to destroy the fungus, but without producing the desired effect; a tooth, nearly opposite the opening, being oc- casionally painful, she was advised to have it extracted; this was done, and there was no longer a difficulty in curing the fungoid growth; for it was absorbed rapidly, the most simple applications only being used.

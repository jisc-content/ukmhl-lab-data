78 Experiment. Effects of the cold bath. Some years since^ when I was making* a series of physiological experiments^ I wished to ascertain what effects would be produced on the pulse by the sudden application of severe cold, for which purpose I plunged my bare arm up to the shoulder into snow ; immedi- ately before the immersion the pulse was 80"", and it quickly rose, when immersed, to 109Â°; this result was contrary to what I expected, and I repeated the experiment. The pulse sometime did not rise so high, but was small and hard. The exposure to so great a degree of cold caused severe pain, and consequently was a source of irritation. However, in deep-seated inflammation, as in that of the brain, and in determination of blood to the head, the application of ice to the scalp is of signal service. The experiment I have related led me to an examination of the principles of the action of cold bath ; and I found, that when a per- son in health takes a cold bath, not being accustomed to it, it produces irritation, and sometimes renders the pulse irregular: but, on the contrary, when a person in a state of irritability and weakness, with a feel- ing of heat about him, goes into a cold bath, it tranquillizes the nervous system, and there- fore is beneficial. It absorbs the superfluous heat, lessens nervous irritability, and reduces

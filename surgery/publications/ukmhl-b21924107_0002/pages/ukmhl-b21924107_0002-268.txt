238 Case, Gangrene from acci- dent. Case. there were some granulations between the bones, which, in sawing, the dresser did not observe, and he cut through them ; a slight haemorrhage ensued, and in the same night the patient died.â€”There was a case, in the other Hospital, in which the ope- ration of amputation was performed; gan- grene existed on one foot, a slight gangrene on the nose, and on the other foot: the leg was amputated; but the gangrene spread on the nose and foot, which, before the operation, were only slightly affected. Amputation, then, should never be performed till the constitu- tion be in an improved state, and healthy granulations have appeared. But, with respect to gangrene from di- minished action, or accident on some im- portant vessel, amputation may be perform- ed without hesitation. A girl was brought to Guys Hospital, who, in endeavour- ing to reach something from a chimney- piece, trod on the fender, which turned over and she fell on its edge: a compound dislocation of the elbow joint, together with a wound of the brachial artery, were produced ; the vessel was tied by the dresser; haemorrhage was arrested; gangrene soon after appeared on the fingers, hand and fore- arm ; when, nine days from the accident.

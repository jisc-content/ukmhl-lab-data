61 but not equally so with that which arises from inflammation of the heart. When the stomach or intestines are in- flamed, the pulse is hard, but is often so small as to be scarcely distinguishable. Persons unacquainted with this fact are afraid to take away blood, although it is imperiously re- quired, on account of the paleness, depres- sion of strength, and smallness of pulse ; as, for instance, in strangulated hernia. This observation also applies to peritoneal inflam- mation. Quickness of pulse is not in itself a suffi- cient proof that bleeding is required; but when united with hardness, no additional evi- dence of its necessity can be wanted; there- fore do not bleed when there is a quick pulse, unless, at the same time, it is hard; for a quick pulse is in itself a proof of irritability, which bleeding will increase. The indication for a repetition of bleeding is said to be a buffy state of the blood; but your decision must not be governed by this appearance alone, for you must still have re- gard to the pulse. When blood is cupped or hollowed upon its surface, it is said to be a proof of inflam- mation, and that bleeding should be repeated; but the following case will show, that even a cupped state of the blood, and buff conjoined with it, are not sufficient evidence that vene- i I

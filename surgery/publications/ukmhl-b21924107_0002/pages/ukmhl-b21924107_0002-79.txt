49 local applications should be such as soothe and allay local irritation, for which purpose emollient and narcotic fomentations are most appropriate. When by such means the acute inflammation has been subdued, it frequently happens that the chronic begins. In the acute stage, our object was to decrease power, but now it is required to stimulate the vessels, to contract their diameters, to diminish the quantity of blood which has accumulated in them, and thus restore them to their natural state, and this is best effected by astringent and stimulating lotions; as the solutions of alum, sulphate of zinc, nitrate of silver, &c.; and as the depletion necessary to check the acute form of the disease, may have produced general debility, medicines will be required to increase the tone of the stomach and to give vigour to the circulation. Another example of chronic inflammation succeeding the acute may be witnessed in gonorrhoea; at first it is necessary to check the violent action in the vessels of the urethra, 1 but you are afterwards obliged to excite ac- ! tion by giving the balsam of copaibae ; and j branch which has been punctured, thus the anastomosis is I cut off; and the blood, which before passed oft* in part by the divided vessel, is thus determined to the affected organ.â€”T.

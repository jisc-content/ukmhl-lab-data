257 may recover, have they ever any recollection of the kind of accident; yet when they regain any power of volition, or sensation, they will act from habit. This is well illustrated by the following case. June 3d. Mr. S.’s horse ran case, away in Chiswell Street, and rushing against a dray was killed. Mr. S. was thrown over the dray, and was taken up senseless. I saw him about half an hour after the accident, when he was restless and impatient: he had • two wounds on the scalp, one of which penetrated to the bone. He was imme- diately bled; but being seized with violent convulsions, and his pulse being slow and weak, the vein was closed. 4th. In the same state as on the preceding evening; at noon, his pulse being hard and quick, he was bled to twelve ounces, and afterwards became more sensible. 5th. Had passed a restless night; the pulse full and slow; he was cupped on the neck. 6th. He ordered the servant to quit the room, got out of bed, bolted the door, and had a stool, but returned to his bed without unbolting the door, which was obliged to be ‘forced open, as they could not rouse him. At another time he , lathered himself with his blistering ointment, as he wished to shave; and washed his feet with some lemonade in the chamber-pot. 7th, He was bled to eight ounces. 9tb.

You will find that the same treatment, which is applicable to inflammation in gene- ral, will be of service in these ulcers, where in- flammation has existed for a long time to a high degree. Rest must be enjoined; and the patient must be kept in bed, in the re- cumbent posture. Fomentations and poul- tices should be employed; fomentations will tend to produce a secretion from the part, and poultices to promote the growth of gra- nulations. With these applications the ves- sels begin to shoot, the sore assumes a better aspect, healthy secretions are thrown out, and granulations form, fibrous matter is depo- sited, and in a little time you will have the skin cover the wound. Fomentation, poul- tices, rest, and the recumbent posture, must be enjoined, and the patient be freely purged; the best cathartic that you can administer is calomel and compound extract of colocynth, and a draught of the infusion of senna and sulphate of magnesia on the following morn- ing; by this plan you will do more to subdue the inflammation, than by any other that I know.

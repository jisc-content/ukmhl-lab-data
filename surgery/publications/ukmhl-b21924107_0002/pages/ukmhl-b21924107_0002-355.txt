325 ries at some distance from the bed; this cir- cumstance of itself would be quite sufficient to convince you that there was a great deter- mination of blood to the brain. Next the patient is seized with rigors, and these follow in very quick succession; hemiplegia often attends, and is generally situated on the op- posite side of the body to that of injury to the brain. Violent convulsions of that side of the body occasionally occur; the patient remains in a comatose state, but when roused will give (until towards the very close of life) ra- tional answers to such questions as may be put to him. These, then, are the ordinary symptoms of inflammation of the brain aris- ing from wounds of that organ. If the inflammation terminates in sup- puration, the matter will be situated, either between the dura mater and skull, pia mater and tunica arachnoides, pia mater and surface of the brain; or, lastly, in the brain itself. . When pus is situated between the dura mater and skull, trephining for its removal is attended with success ; but it is compara- tively rarely there, as it is generally situated between the pia mater and surface of the brain, for which an operation will be useless. Another situation in which matter has been found is in the longitudinal sinus of the dura mater. Y 3 Formation of matter and its si- tuation. Between the skull and dura mater.

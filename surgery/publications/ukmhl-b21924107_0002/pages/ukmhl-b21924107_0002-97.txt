67 will sometimes continue with little alteration for life. There is another mode in which purga- tives produce a beneficial effect in inflam- mation^ by irritating the intestines; blood is determined to them^ and it is abstracted from the part inflamed; upon the acknow- ledged principle, that two increased actions proceed, with difficulty, in the body at the same time. It is of little use to produce action in the intestines, unless you also excite the secretion of the liver; therefore, give mercurials with your saline medicines, as these produce secre- tion of bile : do not give saline aperients alone, which act chiefly upon the intestines ; the best plan is, to administer some mercurial medicine at night, and a purge in the morn- ing. An excellent purge for an adult is, one grain of calomel with four of cathartic ex- tract, or two grains of blue pill, with three of extr: col: comp: castor oil may also be recommended; and as another safe opening medicine, you may prescribeâ€”Infus. sennae with magnes. sulphas. In children, calomel with rhubarb, scam- mony, or antimony, may be ordered as ape- rients; and in addition to these means the use of injections and the warm bath are the best means of restoring the secretions of the diges- F 2 Action on the liver.

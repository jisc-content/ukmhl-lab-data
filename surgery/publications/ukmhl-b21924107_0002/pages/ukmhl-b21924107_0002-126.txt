96 Trachea. the ready production of adhesion, they would have become closed and life destroyed. Sometimes, where inflammation of the mu- cous membrane of the urethra is exceedingly violent, it passes into the adhesive stage, glues the parts together, produces retention of urine, and unless the person were relieved by an operation, the disease would end in the destruction of life. I witnessed the following curious example of this circumstance : a kan- garoo was brought to me for dissection, from Exeter Change ; its bed of straw had caught fire, and, although it was very soon extin- guished, the animal died ; and the proprietor, knowing that it had not been severely burnt, was at a loss to account for its death. Upon examination, the bladder was excessively dis- tended with urine, and it was retained in con- sequence of the closure of the urethra by the adhesive inflammation; the penis having been injured by the fire, the inflammation that followed was violent, and, being adhesive, closed the urethra. Thus you may perceive that common gonorrhoea would destroy life if the urethra were not so constructed that its membrane is more readily affected by the suppurative than by the adhesive inflamma- tion. When inflammation attacks the air tube, it usually happens that, the mucus, which it secretes, becomes purulent; but in

102 the hernial sac, which communicates with the cavity of the abdomen; and if the parts are not afterwards united by the adhesive process, the patient dies. In the operation for aneurism, it is the adhesive inflammation which saves life; a ligature is applied to the artery, a coagulum of blood forms, the adhesive process com- mences, fibrin is poured out, and the inter- nal coats of the artery are glued together; but for this circumstance, when the ligature separates, heemorrhage will certainly ensue. In the operation for the radical cure of hydrocele, we have an excellent opportunity of witnessing the effects of adhesive inflam- mation. After the water has been evacuated, a stimulating injection being thrown into the cavity, excites upon its sides an irritation; inflammation is set up, adhesive matter is thrown out, the internal surface of the cavity generally becomes permanently united, and thus a radical cure is effected. If an incision be required to be made into the tunica vagi- nalis, whilst it is suffering from the adhesive inflammation, its cavity is found filled with a substance which has the appearance of jelly. The treatment of a stump after amputa- tion will best exemplify this subject. In am- putating a limb, your first object is to pre- serve sufficient integuments to cover the ends

112 In the East Indies, where it is the practice of many of the chiefs to cut off the noses of their prisoners, an operation is frequently, and in most cases, successfully performed, to make a new nose. Mr. Carpue has performed some successful operations of the same nature in this country, and the mode of conducting them has been well described by him. Mr. Lynn has made a new under lip, by bringing the skin from beneath the chin. I have made a new portion of urethra from the skin of the scrotum, and Mr. Earle has performed a similar operation with suc- cess. Occasionally some small portions of the soft parts, which had been completely sepa- rated from the body, have again united: many curious cases are on record; but I shall speak more at length on this subject in the Lecture on Wounds.

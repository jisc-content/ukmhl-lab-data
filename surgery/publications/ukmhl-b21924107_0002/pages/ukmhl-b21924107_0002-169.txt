139 Case. The ulcerative process is useful to the ani- mal economy^, in removing extraneous bodies from the system. Thus a ball lodgeddn the body is removed. A gentleman who had formerly received a wound above the zygomatic arch from a ball, called on me, having a swelling on the side of his face. I asked him whether he thought the ball was there? to which he replied, no. Upon cutting on it, I found that it was the ball by which he had been wounded some years before. It had travelled beneath the zygoma to the middle of the cheek, on the surface of the parotid gland, from whence I removed it; perhaps it was assisted in its course by the action of the temporal muscle. I saw a boy at Walworth who had been attending a target, at which some volunteers had been firing: he thought himself safe at a distance of thirteen yards; he was mistaken, however, for one of them shot him in the collar bone. Some months after he came to Guy’s Hospital, and I removed the ball from near the middle of the upper arm. The ball, by its pressure, had occasioned suppuration and ulceration, which had enabled it to travel ed; and I have a cast in ray possession (taken after death from a young woman who died in Guy’s Hospital, from an extensive sore of this description), in which this exposure of these vessels is very extensive.—T.

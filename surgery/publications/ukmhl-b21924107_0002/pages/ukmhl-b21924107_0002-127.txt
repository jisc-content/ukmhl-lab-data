97 very violent inflammation, adhesive matter is effused, and produces the disease which is called croup. If the larynx be the seat of this disease, it frequently destroys life; but when the inflammation is seated in one of the bronchiae, the adhesive matter is coughed up, in an arborescent form, and the patient re- covers. When an incision is made into a part which has been affected by the adhesive in- flammation, viz. the cellular membrane, a quantity of serum is found effused around the inflamed part; and in the part itself, a yellow and semi-transparent substance, hav- ing the appearance of jelly, though different in its nature. The best opportunity of wit- nessing the adhesive inflammation, is on the skin, under the irritation of a blister; the blister produces the same effects as those occasioned by the operation for hydro- cele. Let a blister be applied for twenty-four hours, till the cuticle be raised; then make an incision into the vesicle, and a quantity of serum will escape: here, your observation generally terminates; but examine the sur- face, and you will find on it a yellow substance, which will in a greater or less degree exist, according to the length of time the blister has been applied; also on its severity, and the I irritability of the skin, but, generally under i VOL.

We have already endeavoured to explain to you, that under the action of the vessels which accompanies inflammation, an increas- ed deposit follows from the arteries ; also that this deposition depends on the stage of the inflammation, and the texture of the part in which it is seated; thus the inflammation is either adhesive or suppurative; and it ends in the one state in the immediate production of adhesion, and in the other in the effusion of a quantity of purulent matter from the extremi- ties of the vessels.

2-25 g'ang'rene very rarely happens without inflam- mation ; but as there are some exceptions to this general principle, I will mention them. I have seen, in a case of hydrothorax, a small spot on the leg become at once black, without any appearance of inflammation, and extend itself until it occupied a very large surface. Here the total absence of circula- tion, and not an increased degree of it, oc- casioned the destruction of life in the part. So we now and then see aneurism producing gangrene. In the case of popliteal aneu- rism, to which I before adverted, the gan- grene is produced, not by the bursting of the aneurismal bag, but by its pressure on the vessels, occasioning the destruction of life in the limb below. I saw a gentleman, a few months ago, who appeared upon the point of death from the pressure of a popliteal aneu- rism. His foot afterwards became gangren- ous. He did not die, however; for a separa- tion of the foot, and part of the leg, fol- lowed, and he ultimately recovered. Thus it appears that impeded circulation, without inflammation, is sometimes a cause of gan- grene. The division of a considerable blood vessel will produce the same effect. A per- son was stabbed in the groin by a foreigner, with a dirk or sharp knife, which penetrated VOL. I.

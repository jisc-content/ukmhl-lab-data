66 The proxi- mate cause of inflam- mation. Experiment. which it effects by the process of inflamma- tion ; as bruises, cuts, pressure, extraneous substances, &c. The manner in which nature repairs these injuries will hereafter be more particularly described. The state of the blood does not tend to the production of inflammation ; and the opi- nions formerly entertained of the increased thickness of this fluid in inflammation are now known to be diametrically opposed* to the fact, as the blood is rendered more than usually fluid by it. If a part which is the subject of inflam- mation be examined, the following* are the appearances which I observe : The tail of the tadpole is the best transpa- rent part of an animal for making these ob- servations : in the web of the frogâ€™s foot the vessels are less conspicuous. When the tail of the tadpole is placed under the microscope, a surface appears intersected by rivulets of blood, in which the red particles may be seen rolling on in a most beautiful current. The part is now irritated either by slightly wound- ing it, or by the application of an acid; almost immediately the velocity of the circulation ap- pears to be increased ; in a few minutes little branches of vessels appear to be growing out of the sides of those before visible, into the transparent part; these vessels are now seen 3

125 The second use of matter is seen in ab- cesses^ in which it is the means of exciting absorption, and thus of producing an open- ing, by which the cause of irritation may be removed; and it afterwards covers the rising granulations until they reach the surface of the skin. The coagulable matter, which the pus contains, will lead to the healing of a sore without any adventitious aid. Thus we see, in other animals, sores encrusted with the solid matter of pus left by evaporation: under this is fluid pus contained ; and when the in- crustation is removed, healthy granulations appear. In sores obstinately resisting differ- ent applications, I have seen them thus en- crusted when left without applications of any kind, and heal gradually without further attention. When sores have long existed, some cau- tion is necessary in healing them: nature ap- pears to produce a quantity of blood equal to the discharge which they have supported, and to continue to do so after it has ceased. In- flammation of the lungs and apoplectic sei- ! zures will sometimes follow their sudden cica- 1 . . ! trization. This may be prevented by great i attention to the secretions, by giving fre- I quently calomel at night, and an aperient in the morning; or by occasionally taking i In expelling extraneous bodies. Caution in stopping long-con- tinued sup- puration.

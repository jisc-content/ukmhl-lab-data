Vlll AUTHORâ€™S PREFACE. PREFACE TO TIIE SIXTH EDITION. Although from the extremely short space of time which has ren- dered a sixth edition of this Handbook necessary, very numerous additions and alterations cannot be made, yet I hope, by much im- provement, to have increased its utility. May it still continue to merit the favourable reception it has hitherto enjoyed. CHELIUS. Heidelberg, August, 1843.

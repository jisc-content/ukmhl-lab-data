586 FRACTURES OF THE TOES. superficial branch of the peroneal nerve, and having the heel-bone projecting through it. This bone was entirely deprived of its shell excepting its articular surfaces, but the hinder one for the astrayalus was broken. The shell of the bone was fractured into numerous pieces of various size, and the Achilles’ tendon was partially detached. Amputation was recommended, but to this she would not submit; and therefore, after removing all the loose pieces of bone, I brought the edges together, with the view of producing adhesion. Sloughing, however, ensued, and she died exhausted on the sixth day after the accident.—J. F. S.j [711.* The toe-bones can never be broken without very considerable violence, and, in consequence of their shortness, are rather crushed than broken. Whether simple or accompanied with wound, they are best treated by wrapping up in a poultice, and rest, without any bandaging. If the soft parts be much injured, the whole toe generally sloughs, so that it may be as well to amputate at once, especially as the gait is not much affected thereby. This, however, does not apply to the great toe, which is a very important part of the foot, and a very principal agent in walking, and therefore should be amputated only under circumstances of absolute necessity ; as by its removal not only considerable halting is produced, but the pressure made on the scar induces ulceration and great inconvenience. A pasteboard splint, if the fracture be simple, attached with some slips of adhesive plaster, is sufficient; and the patient should be kept quiet and not allowed to bear on his foot. If the fracture be compound, it is best to apply a poultice, under which the wound heals either by quick union or by granulation ; and when the scarring has taken place, then a pasteboard splint or a gum roller may be applied for the completion of the cure.—J. f. s.]

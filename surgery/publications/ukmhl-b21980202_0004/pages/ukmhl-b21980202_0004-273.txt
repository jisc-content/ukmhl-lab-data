Sed. XVIII. Difeafes of the Eyes. 263 The This ftiort recapitulation of the anato- my of the lachrymal paffages, will |:en- der the defcription now to be given of the difeafes to which they are liable more intelligible. The fiftula lachrymalis arlfes, as I have already obferved, from obftrudtion to the paflage of the tears into the nofe^ but the difeafe affiimes a variety of appear- ances, according to the feat of the ob- ftruftion, and to the effeds produced by it upon the neighbouring parts. Thus we may readily fuppofe, that the fymp- toms produced by obftrudion in the punc- ta lachrymalia, or in the duds leading from thefe to the fac, will be widely dif- ferent from thofe which arife from ob- ftrudion in the lachrymal fac itfelf, or in the dud leading from this fac to the nofe. And again, we might, a priori, conclude, that the appearances induced by a recent obftrudion of any cf thefe parts, mull probably be very different from thofe arlfing from a long contmua- tion of the difeafe.

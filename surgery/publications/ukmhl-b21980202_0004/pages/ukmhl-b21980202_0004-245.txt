Sed. XVil. Bifeafes of the Eyes. 235 left hand with fufficient fteadmefs, I have delineated a knife, fig. 2. Plate XVI. by which it may be eafily done with the right hand, while the patient and furgeon are fitting oppofite to each other in the manner I have direded : only, in this cafe, the point of the knife muft be en- tered at the internal canthiis of the eye^ and mufl then be pufhed outwards to the oppofite,fide, inflead of being introduced at the external angle and carried towards the nofe. The operation being finiflied, the eye fhould be immediately covered with a comprefs of foft lint, or old linen, foaked in a weak faturnine folution, to be retain^ ed by the bandage, fig. 3. Plate XXIX. or any other that does not comprefs the head much, or keep it too warm. For feveral days after the operation, no light fhould be admitted to the patientâ€™s apart- ment. A very low diet fhould be advifed: And the eye being very apt to inflame,, repeated blood-lettings are frequently re- (|uifite from the jugular vein or temporal artery. P 2 As

322 Difeafes of the Eyes. Chap, XI. Mr 3. Although a black catarad is not a frequent occurrence, Mr Pellier fays he has mejt with it in different inftances. The onlj difeafe for which it may be inif- taken is the gutta ferena; but with due attention, the one may be diftinguilhed from the other. In the gutta'ferena the difeafe for the mofl part comes on fud- denly, the pupil is of a deep black, it remains immoveable in every degree of light, and the patient cannot diftinguifh Gololirs, or the cleareft light from perfecl darknefs ^ w^hereas, in the black cataracl, the accelfion of blindnefs is commonly flow and gradual 3 the pupil, to a certain degree, contrafls and dilates on bein^ ex- pofed to light. The bottom of the eye is of a dark colour, but not of fuch a deep black as in the gutta ferena f and the patient can .diftinguifh light and vivid colours. In fhort, the fymptoms of this variety of the difeafe are exadly the fame with thbfe of the common catarad ; on- ly, inftead of being white, the opacity is black.

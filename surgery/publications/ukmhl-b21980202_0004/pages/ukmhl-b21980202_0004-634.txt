566 Explanation oj the Plates. Fig, A well adapted fpeciilum Is an ufeful inflrument in many difeafes of the eyes, but particularly in the operations of couch- ing and extracting the catarad:. As it has been imagined that it may be an advan- tage to be able to withdraw the fpecuium while the knife or needle remains in' the eye, It has been propofed to leave a va- cant fpace for this purpofe in the circle which furrounds the eye-ball, as is repre- fented in fig. 3. The fpecuium fliould be always kept, however, upon the eye, as long as either the extrading knife or couching needle remains in it, otherwife the eye cannot be rendered fufficiently fteady : But to thofe who are of a differ- ent opinion, this form of the inflrument delineated in fig. 3. will anfwer the pur- pofe exadly, Plate XV, Fig. I. A couching needle of the beft form I have ever ufed. It penetrates the eye, more readily than the round needle, fig. 2. and the catarad is more eafily de- prefled with it.

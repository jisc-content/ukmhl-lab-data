5 7 S Explanation of the Plates. Plate Fig. 4. Curved fciffiirs of a proper fize for every operation on the eyes where fciflars are needed : Indeed every opera- tor who pradlifes much in this branch fliould have them. Fig. 5. This is the only fpeculum which Mr Pellier employs. It may be made of gold or filver wire, or of any other metal. It is here reprefented of the full fize both in length and thick- nefs of wire. In ufing It, one of the curves is placed upon the upper eye-lid diredlly behind the cartilaginous bor- der \ and being given to an afiiftant, a degree of force is applied with it fufii- clent for fixing the eye ^ which is eafily done, if the operator at the fame time makes fome refiflance, by placing the in- dex and middle fingers of one hand on the under edge of the orbit, fo as to com- prefs the eye beneath. All the inftniments of this plate are re- prefented of the full fize.

to Difeafes of the Eyes. Chap. XI. fore proceeding farther, it will be proper to premife an anatomical defcriptlon of the parts in which thefe difeafes are feated. Minutenefs on this fubjedi would lead to a greater length than the extent of this work will admit, nor does it appear to be necelTary j I Ihall therefore give only fuch a general defcriptlon as the nature of the difeafes, and the operations to be de- fcribed, feem to require. The, eyes, and part of their appendages, are placed in two bony cavities, termed the Orbits, formed by a conjundion of the in- ferior part of the frontal bone with feveral other bones of the head and face ; name- ly, with the offa maxillarja, offa malarum, ofla unguis, os ethmoides, os fpheholdes, and oila palati. All the upper part of the orbits is formed by the orbitar procelfes of the frontal bone ^ and the fame pro- eelTes form a confiderable vacuity in each orbit towards the external canthus of the eye, in which the glandhla lachrymalis is lodged. The inferior part of the'orbits is formed by the offamaxillaria and offa ma- larum, which alfo form part of the fdes or 3 angles

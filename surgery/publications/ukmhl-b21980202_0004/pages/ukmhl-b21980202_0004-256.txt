2^6 Difeafes of the Eyes, Chap. XL it ; the catarad: muft necefTarily pafs through the pupil, and in doing fo the iris is often Irreparably injured. As this renders the operation much more hazardous than it otherwife would be, it has always appeared to me that it would be an objed of much importance to extrad the catarad in any other man- ner that would not expofe the iris to this hazard. It may be done by opening the eye behind this membrane, initead of making the incifion in the ufual place in the lucid cornea; audit would be attend- ed with this advantage, that no inconve- nience would enfue from the cicatrix. I have performed the operation in this way on other animals ; but it has never, fo far as I know, been put in pradice on the human eye. The objedions which occu^ to it are, that the opening being made in the fclerotica, the Inflammation induced by it muft probably be great; and this coat of the eye being thicker than the tranfparent cornea, wounds made in it are commonly fuppofed to be more diffi- 3 cult.

Sed. XVIII. > Difeafes of the Eyes. 307 It was propofed a confiderable time ago by different pradlitioners, to obviate the uncertainty attending this operation, by introducing a fmall canula of gold or fil- ver, either through the natural paflage of the os unguis, or through an opening made with a trocar ^ and by leaving the canula, and healing the ikin over it, thus to form a paffage which no difeafe of the confti- tution could a<5t upon. By thofe who con- fider the ulual operation for the fiftula lachrymalls as very uncertain, it has been propofed to employ a canula of this kind in every cafe; but as this operation, when properly performed, proves for the moft part completely fuccefsful, and as patients in general confider it as a fevere meafure to have any extraneous body left in a wound with a view to remain, I would not advife it in any cafe till we have found by expe-. rience that the other will not fucceed. In every cafe, however, where the uliial oÂ« peration has failed, the method of cure by a canula ought to be tried; and when properly performed, it will often fucceed. Tubes

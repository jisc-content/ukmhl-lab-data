Se6l. XVII. Difeafes of the Eyes. 201 of a ca^arail Is ill-founded, than the. variety of opinions that prevail refpedling it: For while by fome it is faid that this ftate of the dlfeale is indicated by a pure white or milky appearance, others affert, that a light gray or pearl colour Is the on- ly certain mark of it. Now, the fact is, that the real ilate of a cataradt can ne- ver be known from Its colour ^ and the beft Informed pradlitioners will allow, that no advantage is to be derived from this means of diftindion. The idea of a catarad being more ripe at one period of the difeafe than at an- other, originated, as I have obferved above, from the cryftalline being In fome inftances found to be fluid, which gave caufe to fufped that the firfl: effid of a catarad is to Induce a foftnefs of the lens, and that this foft or fluid ftatfe of it. is gradually altered by the progrefs or continuance of the difeafe, by which it is fuppofed to acquire a firm confiflence, when it is conceived to be thoroughly ripe.

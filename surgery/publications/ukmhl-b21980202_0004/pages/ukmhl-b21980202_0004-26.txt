18 Vifeafes of the Eyes. Chap. XI* The traniparent, and of a gelatinous confift- ence: This humour is completely fur- rounded by a very delicate membrane, which likewife appears to pafs through the fubfiance of this gelatinous mafs, and to confine it in a kind of cellular texuure or net-work. In the anterior furface of the vitreous humour, we find a depreflion exadlly oppofite to the pupil, for the pur- pofe of receiving the cryftalline humour, a fubflance of a much firmer texture than xtfelf, and of a rounded or lentic\ilar fhape. This body, or the Lens as it is commonly termed, is retained in its fi- tuation by a very fine membrane or cap- fule, which appears to be formed by the capfiile of the vitreous humour, fepara- ting or dividing at this part into t;wo di- flind: laminae. It has indeed been fup- pofed, that the cryftalline lens has a cyft or capfiile peculiar to itfelf; but I have never been able to diftinguifh it, nor has any fufficient evidence ever been given of it. ,

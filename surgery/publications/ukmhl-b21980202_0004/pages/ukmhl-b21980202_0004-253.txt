243 Se6l. XVII. Difeafes of the Eyes. The any preffure made upon the ball of the eye by the fpeculum, or even by the na- tural action of the mufcles of the eye, is therefore very apt to force it out. Inftead of this, when the incilion is made in the upper part of the cornea, the lens may be extradted with equal eafe 3 while a confi- derable part of the aqueous humour being Hill retained by the inferior half of the cornea remaining entire, the vitreous hu- mour is neither fo fuddenly nor fp entirely deprived of the fupport which it affords, and does not efcape fo readily as in the ordinary method of performing the ope- ration. At leaft, this I have found to hap- pen in other animals^ and there is reafon to imagine that it will likewife take place, when the operation is done on the human eye. It is probable, too, that another advan- tage may be derived from the incifion be- ' ing made in the upper part of the cornea* One material objedion to this operation, when done in the ufual way, arifes, as I have already obferved, from the cicatrix induced by the incifion on the cornea.

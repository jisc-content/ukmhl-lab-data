Explanation of the. Plates* 567 Fig. 3. A needle of a flat form fimilar to fig. I. with a fmall curve near to the point. With this curve I have fome- times found that the catarad; is more ea- lily depreiled than with a flraight needle ; but I have not yet ufed it fo frequently as to be able to fpeak with certainty a- bout it. Figs. 4. and 5. Two needles, for per- forming the operation of Couching, by entering the inftrument at the internal angle of the eye, and pufliing it out to- wards the other. By which means the operation may be done upon the right eye with the right hand; w^hereas, with the common flraight needle, the left hand mufl be ufed for the right eye ; a degree of fteadinefs, which fome praditioners cannot always attain with the left hand. All thefe inAruments are delineated of a fize exadly fit for ufe. The handles fhould be made of light timber, and the fteel part of them fliould be poliflied in the mofl exquifite manner. None of them fliould exceed forty grains in weight. N n 4 Plate

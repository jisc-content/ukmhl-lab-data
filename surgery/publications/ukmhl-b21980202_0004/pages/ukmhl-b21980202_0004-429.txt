In this manner almoft every polypus in any part of the nofe may be extirpated. Thbfe who have not feen it put in prac- tice, may be apt to doubt of this aflertion; but a few trials will ftiow that it is not on- ly the moft effectual method, but the fafeft and eafieft that has yet been propofed of removing polypi of every kind : It alfo has the advantage over every other me- thod of applying ligatures upon polypi in the nofe, of anfwering equally well in the large as in the fmaller kinds of themâ€”and it may even be applied where the tumor is fo large as to diftend the noftril to a confiderable fize.

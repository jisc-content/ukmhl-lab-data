The fliape of the firft is nearly that of a fpear- pointed lancet; only the back of it is blunt, excepting a fourth part of an inch or thereby near the point, which ftiould be fharp on both edges ; and that fide of the knife which pafles next the iris fhould be fomewhat round, while the other^ is nearly or altogether flat. By this we pre- vent, as much as pofiible, any rifk of hurt- ing the iris, which is apt to happen with a knife that is flat on both fides and with both edges fharp through its whple length.. The operation has frequently indeed been performed with this kind of knife, but it is. done with more fafety with the one I have mentioned.

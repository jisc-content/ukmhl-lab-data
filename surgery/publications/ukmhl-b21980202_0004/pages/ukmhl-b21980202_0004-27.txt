19 Sedl. I. Bifeafes of the Eyes. The The whole anterior part of the eye, from the termination of the vitreous and cryftalline humours, to the internal fur- face of the tranfparent cornea, is filled with the aqueous humour, a thin tranfpa- rent fluid. By the iris, already defcri- bed, this part of the eye is divided into two unequal departments: The fmallefl of thefe, which is fcarcely a tenth of an inch in width, ^nd lies between the iris and the capfule of the vitreous Tiumour, is termed the Pofterior Chamber ^ and the other, which is confiderably larger, and occupies the whole fpace from the iris to the cornea, is called the Anterior Cham- ber of the eye. Although thefe two di- vifions of the eye, however, are perfed- ly diftind, it is obvious that they mufl: communicate at the pupil, the opening in the centre of the iris. The mufcles of the eye are fix in num- ber; namely, the levator oculi, the de- prefTor, addudor and abdudor, the obli- quus fuperior and inferior. By thefe all |:he motions of the eye are performed.â€”

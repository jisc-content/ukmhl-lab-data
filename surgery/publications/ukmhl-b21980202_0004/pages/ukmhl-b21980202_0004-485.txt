475 Sed. I. Difeafes of the Lips. the lip. This fiifpiclon, however, can have occurred only to thofe who have ne- ver ufed it; for when the blades are fmooth and equal, a degree of eompref- fion may be made with it perfeclly fuffi- cient for fixing the lip without giving a- ny degree of uneafinefs to the patient. This I can affert from much experience of its utility. Inftead of making the incifion in thjs manner, fome have diredled it to be done by fitting a piece of pafteboard, lead, or tin, to the gums beneath; and the lip being placed upon it, it is divided by cut- ting down upon it with a fcalpel into the fupporting fubftance : The operation may no doubt be done in this manner, but the cut is more eafily made in the man- ner I have advifed. Till of late the incifion in this opera- tion was commonly made with fciflars ; and although they are now very general- ly laid afide on the fnppofition of their bruifing the lip, yet I know that the ope- ration may be very properly done with G g 2 them.

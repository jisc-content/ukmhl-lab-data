The bottom or back part of each orbit is formed by the ethmoid, fphenoid, and a fmall portion of the palate bones; and a fmall part of the internal corner or angle of each orbit is filled up by the bs unguis. As this lafl: mentioned bone, the os un- guis, is frequently the fubjed of" a nice operation, it is more particularly necefi fary for furgeons to be well acquainted with its ftrudure and fituation. A con- fiderable part of it is fo thin and brittle,, that a pefforation may be made in it with very little force; with lefs indeed than is commonly imagined; for not being thicker than fine paper, the point of a lharp inftrument is eafily made to pafs through it. The internal furface of the,os unguis, which in part covers the cells of the ethmoid bone, is fomewhat rough ; but its external furface is fmootfi, and confifts of tWo deprelGons or con- A 2 cavities

Sâ‚¬(S. II. Nofe and Fauces, 373 In SECTION II. Of Hemorrhagies from the'NoJlrils, HE internal parts of the nofe are fupplied almoft entirely with blood from the internal maxillary artery: And, in. general, the branches of this artery that go to the nofe are fo fmall, as to render a divifion or rupture of any of them an ob- ject of little importance. In fome inftan- ees, however, it is otherwife, and he- morrhagies occafionally occur from thefe parts that give much anxiety and diftrefs to praditioners, and prove very hazardous to patients. They have fometimes even baffled every attempt that, could be made to reftrain them. However trifling, there- fore, this evacuation may for the mofl: part appear, it ought always to be treat- jsd with attention.

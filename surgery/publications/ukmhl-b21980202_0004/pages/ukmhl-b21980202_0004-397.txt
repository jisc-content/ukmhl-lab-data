Sed. IIL t^ofe and Fauces,. 3^7 This thus prevented, and the fores kept clean by the frequent ufe of an aftringent antiâ€œ feptic wafh, the paflage of the noftril will be preferved pervious, the difeafe will not fp'read fo readily, and at the fame time the carious bones will proba- bly be more quickly feparated and thrown off than when thefe circuinftanccs are o- verlooked. Till the caries is removed, no perma- nent cure can be expedted. The treat- ment therefore that I have juft pointed out Ihould be perftfted in till this is fully ac- compliflied. Indeed, after a fufBcient quantity of mercury is exhibited for the removal of any latent venereal taint that might exift in the fyftem, all that we can exped: farther from art, is to allift in the manner I have advifed, in effeding a fe- paration of fuch bones as are difeafed. This being done, the fores will aflurne a milder afped, and will in general heal by a continuance of the aftringent applica- tions alone.

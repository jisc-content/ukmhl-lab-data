In the anatomical defcription that I premifed of thefe parts, we have feen that the pofterior part of the lachrymal fac is lodged in and attached to a groove in the os unguis; and as the fac is feparated from the cavity of the correfponding no- ftril by this bone only, it is evident that an opening made frotn the back part of the fac mull ferve to convey the contents of it into the nofe.

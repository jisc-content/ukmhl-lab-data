But the explanation I have given fcts it in a more diftind point of view. Thefe tumors of the amygda- lae, commonly' termed Shirrous Tonfils, are not of the true fchirrous nature; and hence it is that they never degenerate in- to cancer, nor return 'after extirpation; and this is accordingly a very weighty argument for removing them as foon as they become fo large as to impede either deglutition or refpiration.

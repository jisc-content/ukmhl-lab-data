582 Explanation of the Plates. Figs. 8. and 9. A tube "and tent with a ftile and firing united to each and rea- dy for ufe. Thefe tubes and tents Mr Watheri ob- ferves are of the largeft fcale : There are two inferior fcrews; the middlemoft of which proves mofl generally applicable. I have thus given a delineation of this part of Mr Wathen’s apparatus, with which I doubt not that the fiftula lachry- malis may be cured; but I confider it in every part as inferior to what I have delineated in Plate XXV. both for the form of tubes and method of introducing them. For a more particular detail, how- ever, than can be given here of the me- thod of ufing Mr Wathen’s apparatus, his book jfhould be confultedy in which many valuable obfervations will be met with Plate * Vide A New and Eafj Method of curing the Fi- flula Lachrymalis ; the Second Edition, &c.

Explanation of the Plates. J99 contents of the lun^s are difcharged up* on the furface of the water 3 and inftead of forcing the water back through the hollow handle, the air efcapes by lifting the round light cork valve fo as to fet- tle upon the furface of the body under the bedâ€˜Cloaths. Thus the whole a6i: of refpiration is performed, without removing the inftru- ment from the mouth. The flexible part of the tube D is a- bout fix inches long, fitted with a wooden mouth-piece E at one end, and a part G of the fame materials at the other, to be received into the cone C on the cover. This flexible tube is made by winding a long flip of filkoil-lkin over a fpiral brafs- wire. This fliould be then covered with one of the fame fize, of thin filk, and both fecured by ftrong fewing filk wound fpirally round them. Some length and degree of flexibility is necelfary to this tube, for the fake of a convenient ac- commodation to the mouth when the head is laid on the pillow. Care

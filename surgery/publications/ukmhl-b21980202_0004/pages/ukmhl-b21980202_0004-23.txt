X 5 ment of the tranfparent oornea, where a circular whitifti ring is formed by this jundion of the choroides with the fcle- rotica, commonly termed the Ligamen- tum Ciliare. From this jundion of the choroid with the fclerotic coat, a perfo- rated kii^d of curtain or feptum is produ- ced, which from the variety of its co- lours is termed, the Iris. The perfora-' tion in the centre of' this membrane is termed the Pupil, and ferves tp admit the rays of light to the bottom of the eye. Towards the middle of the iris, we perceive a number of radiated lines run- ning from the circumference to the cen- tre : Thefe are denominated the ciliary proceiles, and on their adion the con^ tradlon and dilatation of the pupil ap- pears to depend; for it feems to be doubt- ful, whether any circular fibres exift in the iris or not.

S37 'Sed:, VI, Difeafes of the Mouth. VoL. IV. L 1 The fented in Plate XXXVIL fig. 3. In the courfe of the operation, care fliould be taken to remove the difeafe entirely, at the fame time that the incifion fliould not be carried fo deep as to injure the parts be- neath, unlefs the tumor is firmly and clofely attached to them ^ in which cafe, it may not only be proper to remove a portion of the gums, but even to go to,the depth of thefocket: But as this ^ill incur the rilk of injuring the contiguous teeth by laying their ropts bare, it fliould never be advifed when with any propriety it can be avoided. After the operation the blood-vefiels that have been divided fliould be encou- raged to bleed freely : But when the he- morrhagy proceeds too far, it Ihould be reftrained, by the patient being made to take from time to time a mouthful of fpi- jrit of wine or tindure of myrrh ^ or if this does not prove fufficient, the appli- cation of lunar cauftic to the bleeding ar- teries will feldom or never fail.

Se£l. VIH. IJofe and Fauces, 453 In the treatment of inflammatory affec- tions of thefe parts, we often find it ne- ceffary to recommend fomentations 3 a remedy, too, which proves frequently highly ufeful in catarrhal affedlions of the trachea and lungs. Various methods are propofed for conveying fleams to thefe parts; but the befl I have ever feen, and it is likewife the neatefl and moft fimple in its conflrudion, is the inflru- ment delineated in Plate XL. fig. 2. the invention of Mr Mudge of Plymouth. By means of it, the throat, trachea, and lungs, may be very effedlually fomented by drawing warm fleams into them, and without any difficulty or inconvenience to the patient, who may lie in bed during the whole operation.—This inflrument I confider as fo highly ufeful in the treat- ment of every cafe of catarrh, that I think every family fhould have it.

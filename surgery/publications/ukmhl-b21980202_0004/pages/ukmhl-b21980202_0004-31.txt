Sedi; I. Difeafes of the Eyes. 23 der of which, towards the roots of the cilia, a number of fmall follicles are pla- ced, named after their difcoverer, the follicles or glands of Meibomius ^ from whence is poured out a vifcid febaceous matter, commonly termed the gum of the eyes. * The motion of the eye-lids is perform- ed entirely by two mufcles, the orbicu- laris palpebrarum, and the Jevator palpe- brae fuperioris. The former is common to both the eye-lids; It originates by a fmall tendon at the inner angle of the eye, and by fine flefhy fibres from the orbitar procefs of the maxillary bone, and is inferted by a fmall round tendon into the nafal procefs of the fame bone. A few of the. tendinous fibres of this mufcle are Spread upon, and fccm to be inferted into, the anterior furface of the lachrymal fac. The ufe of this mufcle is to draw the eye-lids together, and to com- prefs the eye-ball. The levator palpebral fuperioris origi- nates from tiie bottom of the orbit, and is

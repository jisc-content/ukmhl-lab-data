Difeafes of the Chap. XII. 444 however, may be adopted when any dif- ficulty occurs in the application of the li- gature in the manner I have mentioned. For the moll part we find both tonfils nearly equally enlarged • In fome cafesp the removal of one of them forms a fuffi« cient opening for the paflage of the fogd^. but \yhen it becomes neceflary to extir*- pate both, it anfwers better to. allow any inflammation or tenfion induced by the removal of the firft, to fubfide entirely before attempting to remove the other.^ This mode of applying ligatures upon thefe tumors, is in my opinion the bell; but it may often be done in a different manner. Let a ligature fufiiciently ftrong be formed of waxed thread ^ and let this be carried round the tumor either with the fingers or with a fplit probe, fuch as is reprefented in Plate XXXIII. fig. 2. A noofe is now to be made upon it, with which a knot of any degree of tightnefs may be formed- on it by fixing one end of the thread at the fide of the tumor in the throat, with the inflrument, fig. 2.

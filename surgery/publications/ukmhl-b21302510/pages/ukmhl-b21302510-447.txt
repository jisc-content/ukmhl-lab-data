R E P 0 E I ON MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. BY C. HILTON EAGGE, M.D., M.R.C.P., ASSISTANT-PHYSICIAN TO, AND LECTURER ON EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY AT, GUY’S HOSPITAL; PHYSICIAN TO THE ROYAL INFIRMARY FOR THE DISEASES OF CHILDREN AND WOMEN. Poisoning. In an essay on tlie subject of poisoning, M. Tardieu* discusses various questions which arise in medico-legal inquiries from a point of view which differs from that ordinarily adopted. The most interesting part of his paper appears to be that in which he discusses the question whether it is necessary that the medical jurist should be able to de- termine the exact nature of the substance which gave rise to illness or death in the particular case under inquiry. “ If the fact of poisoning,” he says/ ‘has been established it seems to he at least superfluous to inquire what was the poisonous substance. If the death of a person is the result of injuries to the head, fracturing the skull, it would appear to he a matter of no importance, or at least of secondary importance, to determine with absolute accuracy what instrument produced the wounds. Yet there is not the least difference in this respect between such a case and one of poisoning. Indeed, whereas the exact determination of the weapon may often aid in the discovery of the murderer in a case of assassination, it is very rare that the nature of the poison used adds in any way to the elucidation of a poisoning case. But,” continues M. Tardieu, “ so artificial and opposed to common-sense is the construction * “ Etude medico-legale sur l’empoisonnement,” 1 Annales d’Hyg.,’ 2eme ser., xxiii, p. 108. The essay in the ‘ Annales d’Hygiene’ consists merely of certain chapters of the complete systematic work on the subject since published by M. Tardieu. 28

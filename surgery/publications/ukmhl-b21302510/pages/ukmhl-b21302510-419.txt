PUERPERAL ECLAMPSIA. 407 before the society there could not be found any with premonitory symptoms which of themselves would warrant any operative measures being taken in order to avert the impending danger. A case of labour in which fracture of the 'pelvis occurred is recorded by Dr. Van der Espt (‘ Journ. de Med. Brux.,’ 1866). Inversion of the uterus is illustrated in the following:—Dr. Sidey (‘Edin. Med. Journ.,’ 1866), Dr. Denham (‘Dubl. Quart. Journ. of Med.,’ 1866), Dr. Prael (‘Mon. f. Geb.,’ 1865), Dr. Courty (‘Gaz. d. Hop.,’ 1866), Dr. Mattei (ibid.), Dr. Clemens (‘ Wurzb. Med. Ztschr.,’ 1865), Dr. Casati (‘Anna!. Univ. di Med.,’ 1866), Dr. Ogle (‘Pathol. Trans.,’ 1866), Dr. G. Moller (‘Mon. f. Geb.,’ 1866), Dr. Marion Sims (‘ Obstet. Trans.,’ vii), E. Clemensen (‘Hospital Tidende,’ 1863). Hcemorrhctge.—Dr. D. W. Parsons (‘Med. Times and Gaz.,’ 1865) relates a case of flooding, in which contraction was caused by electro- magnetism. Dr. J. G. Wilson (‘ Glasgow Med. Journ.,’ 1866) effected contraction by the ether-spray. Prolapsed 'placenta.—See cases by P. Miiller (‘Wurzb. Med. Ztschr.,’ 1866), DrSinuts (‘Obstet. Trans.,’ viii). Placenta prcevia.—See a remarkable case by George Eoper (ibid.). Retention of placenta.—See E. Howitz (‘Bibliotek f. Laeger,’ ,1866), Dr. Baumgartner (‘Rev. Ther. Med. Chir.,’ 1865). Accidental or concealed haemorrhage.—J. T. Mitchell, R. Dunn, R. Greenhalgh, Dr. Brunton (‘Obstet. Trans.,’ viii). Transfusion of Hood.—Prof. Simon Thomas relates a case (‘ Schmidt’s Jahrb.,’ 1865). See also Drs. Aveling and G. Hewitt (‘ Obstet. Trans.,’ vii). Puerperal Eclampsia. Cases of puerperal convulsions successfully treated by the inhalation of chloroform are reported by Dr. James Cutbill (‘ Edin. Med. Journ,,’ 1865). Dr. Cairns relates (‘Edin. Med. Journ.,’ Eeb. 1866) a case of convulsions apparently due to shock and haemorrhage. A primipara was affected with partial right hemiplegia. At times haemorrhage occured. Pains were weak, and had no influence on the os uteri. The membranes were ruptured. Labour on, but in four hours a convulsive fit occurred. No oedema, no albumen in the urine. Several fits. Live child delivered by long forceps. The placenta was found to contain a rupture near the centre. She ultimately recovered. Dr. Putegnat contributes (‘Journ. de Med., &c., Bruxelles,’ 1866) a memoir on eclampsia. He relates six cases. Pour were primiparae. In one the convulsions appeared before labour, in one during, and in two after labour. Three died; one before, one during, one after labour. One was killed by a single attack, one died undelivered. Not one of the six had oedema. In three cases the urine was examined ; in one only was much albumen found, in one there was a slight cloud, in one nothing. In the case of a single girl, Bet. 19, who had been delivered without accident, violent emotion was caused by the visit of her lover, promising marriage, and again by the reproaches of her parents. The attack followed this. The urine was not examined. She died in epileptic eclampsia. In another case, in which the eclampsia broke

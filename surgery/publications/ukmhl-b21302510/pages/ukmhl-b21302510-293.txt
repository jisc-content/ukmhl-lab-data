DISLOCATIONS OF THE SPINE. 281 “In 3 the cause is not given. Of these, i died and 2 terminated well. “If to these we add 52 cases performed by surgeons abroad, we get 109 in the whole. “ Of these, 64 were for compound dislocations, of which 5 were com- plicated with fracture; 4 were for compound fracture ; 20 for simple dislocation; 10 for disease (caries); 1 was for necrosis; of 10 the causes are not stated. “ Of the 64 excisions performed for compound dislocation, 50 recovered with good and useful limbs; 1 underwent secondary amputation of the leg, and recovered; 11 died, of whom 1 had undergone secondary am- putation ; of 2 the results are not given. “ Of the 4 operated upon for compound fracture, 3 recovered with good and useful limbs ; 1 died. “ Of the 20 operated upon for simple dislocation, in 4, of whom 1 died, the bone was allowed to remain for a month ; in 1 the bone remained for nineteen weeks ; in 7, of whom 2 died, the bone was removed immediately; in 2 the bone was removed for secondary caries, but at what period it is not stated. In the remaining 6 the period of removal is not given. “ Of these 20, 14 recovered with good and useful limbs ; 3 died ; in 3 the results are doubtful. “ Of the 10 cases performed for disease (caries), 6 recovered with good and useful limbs; 1 submitted to secondary amputation two years afterwards, and recovered ; 1 died ; in 2 the results are doubtful. “ The patient operated upon for necrosis did well. “Of the 10 cases the causes of which are unknown, 2 recovered with good and useful limbs; 1 died; in 7 the results are not known. “ So that of the 109 cases, 76 recovered with good and useful limbs ; 2 submitted to secondary amputation, 1 recovered; 16 died, including 1 in which secondary amputation had been performed; in 14 the results are not known.” In ‘ Omodei’s Annali Universali di Medicina,’ 1863, vol. 191, p. 383, will be found a digest of a memoir by Prof. Porta on “ Dislocations of the Vertebrae,” which was read before the Loyal Lombard Institution of Science and Letters, and published in series 3, vol. x, of the memoirs of that body. The cases on which this memoir is founded are 27 in number—13 in the cervical, 10 in the dorsal, and 4 in the lumbar region—all traumatic. Two were caused by somersaults, 2 by falls, 1 by the combined action of a bullet-wound and a fall, 2 by indirect force (a blow on the head in one case, and a fall on the nates or perhaps the back in the other) ; all the rest, 20 in number, by direct blows on the part. Fourteen cases were complicated with fracture, 5 in the cervical, 6 in the dorsal, 3 in the lumbar region. Most were accom- panied by palsy. Six only were cured. Dissection was practised in 20 out of the 21 fatal cases. This memoir does not include any case of luxation of the atlas on the occiput or of the axis on the atlas. Two kinds of dislocation are dis-

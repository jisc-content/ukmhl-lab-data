DISEASES OE THE CIRCULATOllY SYSTEM. 178 may occasionally exist without thrombosis, and often occurs without being followed by pysemia. Pyaemia often exists without any evidence of phlebitis or thrombosis ; still oftener it occurs without any evidence that it has been preceded by either of these, or by any other affection of the veins. It has, therefore, not been satisfactorily shown that either phlebitis or thrombosis stands, in any especial or peculiar manner, in re- lation to pyaemia, as cause and effect.” Other papers, &c., on diseases of the organs of circulation are— Alexander, thrombosis of the portal vein and its branches (‘ Berl.

VASCULAR PROTRUSION OF THE EYE. 359 near to its origin, is, I think, now certainly proved. In cases of trau- matic origin, supervening soon after severe injury to the head, the cause is most probably effused blood near to or within the carvernous sinus, while in those cases where the protrusion does not come on until some time after the receipt of the injury, or where the violence has not been so considerable, it may he serum, or fibrine, or even pus, the result of suppuration in the sinus.” Where the protrusion takes place more slowly and is unaccompanied by the acute symptoms usually resulting from aneurismal pressure, we may suspect the cause to he some growth in or near the cavernous sinus, or some tumour or effusion within the orbit and near its apex, rather than aneurism, whether true or false. Mr. Nunneley believes that “in a less intense degree and more chronic condition protrusion of the eyeball resulting from posterior venous congestion is by no means uncommon. Whatever obstructs the return of blood may indirectly, if not directly, induce fulness of the eyeball. Tumours of every kind in the orbit, cranium, or neck, may be all causes.” The author quotes as examples exophthalmic goitre, the prominence of the eye not unfrequently seen in heart disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and confirmed asthma.* Lachrymal apparatus.—Mr. Laurence has re-introduced removal of the lachrymal gland as a radical cure for lachrymal disease ;j* he has removed nine glands, and considers this operation applicable to those cases of inveterate fistula which other methods have failed to cure.

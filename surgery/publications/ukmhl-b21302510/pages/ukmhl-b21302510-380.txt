REPORT MIDWIFERY AND THE DISEASES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN. R. BARNES, M.D., F.R.C.P. I. GYNAECOLOGY, EMBRACING THE PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OE THE NON-PREGNANT STATE. Menstruation.—The Ovaries. The normal state of the uterus and ovaries during menstruation is well shown in a case by Dr. Gfraily Hewitt (‘ Obstet. Trans.,’ viii, 1867). Dr. Allbutt relates the following case of ‘premature menstruation (‘ Med.-Chir. Trans.,’ 1866) :—M. A. W— was seen in the summer of 1865, and was reported to have menstruated within the last few days. Her age was one year and sis months. The child was then suffering from emaciation, weakness, quick pulse, and other symptoms of hectic fever. These symptoms passed off in a few days, and the child partially recovered her health. On examination the anal and genital regions were found free from discharge, and quite healthy iu appearance. On the following month the discharge again appeared, and after it had passed away the author found the child as before—in a state of hectic, and still presenting a perfectly healthy appearance about the anus and pudenda. He was unfortunately unable, being absent from home for a while, to see the child during the continuance of the flow. In about a fortnight the child had again recovered some degree of health. On many occasions the author carefully examined the child for disease in other organs, but did not find anything of importance. At the third monthly period he actually saw the child in a menstruating state. The discharge appeared with curious accuracy at the month, and lasted about two days and a half. The discharge was sanguineous, and in every way resembled that of a girl at puberty, but was more scanty iu quantity.

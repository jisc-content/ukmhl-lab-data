The principles on which disinfectants should be employed in the pre- vention of cholera are ably discussed in a paper by Professors W. Griesinger, Max v. Pettenkofer, and C. A. Wunderlich, which also contains general rules for the guidance of sanitary authorities, prac- titioners, and the public, during the prevalence of this disease. A translation is published, without curtailment, as an appendix to vol. xliv of the ‘Half-yearly Abstract of the Medical Sciences.’ It is stated that the main object is to prevent the spontaneous decomposi- tion of the discharges, by which these acquire an alkaline reaction, and that the best and cheapest disinfectant is the sulphate of iron, or, in certain localities, the chloride of manganese. It is also recommended that carbolic acid in small quantity should be used in addition to the sulphate of iron. The writers of this paper are very doubtful as to the value of the chloride of lime.

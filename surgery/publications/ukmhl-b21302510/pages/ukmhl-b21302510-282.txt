In estimating the com- parative value of reduction by manipulation, it is only fair to mention, successful as the practice has been in the hands of my colleagues and myself, it is highly probable that, after the method becomes more fami- liar to us and others, and the required conditions better understood, that greater and more favorable will be the general results ; for to each of us the practice was new, and had to be done for the first time by each of us. I need hardly remind my hearers that it is precisely in such manual feats as these that practice makes perfect; and that those who have before done it, or seen others do it, are likely to perform better than those who have not had the advantage. “ The most important condition to be ensured is a relaxed, but not perfectly helpless, flaccid, uncontractile condition of the muscles; as it is by the contraction of the muscles which are attached near to the head of the dislocated bone that reduction is mainly accom- plished. The importance of constantly bearing this in mind I cannot too strongly impress upon those who may feel inclined to attempt the plan of reduction by manipulation. If the muscles which are more immediately concerned be in a state of active, rigid contrac- tion, as they commonly are after a dislocation has existed for a short space of time, and the patient hqs recovered'from the immediate shock of the accident, they will almost inevitably prevent those move- ments of the bone which are essential for its being brought into a posi- tion for slipping into the socket, whence it has been removed; while, on the other hand, if they be incapable of any contraction whatever, it will frequently be found to be impossible for any manipulatory move- ments of tbe surgeon to replace the bone, or, being replaced, for its being retained in its position. I feel confident that I have seen both of these causes materially interfere with success, particularly the latter one, when the muscles have been entirely paralysed, owing to the ansesthesia having been rendered too profound. In the wish to prevent any muscular resistance whatever, the necessity for some contractility has been forgotten, or not understood. If the patient be still suffering from the shock of the injury, sickness, drunkenness, or, from age or any other cause, be in a depressed condition, he will hardly require to be put under chloroform or any other anaesthetic; but, on the contrary, if the patient be young and vigorous, if the muscles are in strong con- tractile action, or have been shortened by the loss of their normal op- posing resistance, particularly where the dislocation is of long standing, or where there are adhesions to overcome, then the anaesthesia should at first be sufficiently profound to allow of free manipulatory move- ments being effected, so as to have overcome all such resistance by the time returning contractile power in the adjuvant muscles may be ready to pull the bone into the socket. “ As the first commencement of manipulation, particularly in cases of recent dates, the movements made with the limb should be very gentle, not rough nor abrupt. The limb should bo well flexed ; then, when all the muscles are relaxed as much as possible, and, so to speak, thrown off their guard, the limb should be suddenly and rapidly, but not violently, rotated on its axis, and completely abducted or adducted, as the case requires, and at the same time depressed or raised, when the

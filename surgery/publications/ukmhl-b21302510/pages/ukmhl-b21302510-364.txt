352 REPORT Olsr SURGERY. In 9 cases the subclavian has been tied in the first part of its course, viz., by Colies, Haxden of Dublin, Liston, Mott, Oâ€™Reilly of Dublin, Partridge, Rodgers of New York, and twice by Auvert. All these died of hamiorrhage, supervening more rapidly than when the innominate was operated on, and proceeding, as it appears, in all cases from the distal end. This is held by M. Le Port to be a strong support to the theory, that the fatal event is caused by the re-establishment of the cir- culation in the anastomosing branches, of which the vertebral is the most active ; and that, by lessening the distance between the ligature and the vertebral artery, the danger is increased. Hence a strong motive for securing that vessel at first.

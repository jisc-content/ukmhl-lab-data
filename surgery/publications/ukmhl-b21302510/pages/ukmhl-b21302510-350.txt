In 27 the ends of the radius or ulna, or of both, were removed ; and, in some instances, shattered fragments of the upper row of carpal bones. In 8 the greater part of the carpus was excised. Death took place once from pyaemia, and twice from ex- haustion from protracted suppuration and ^irritative fever; 26 cases are reported as recovered. In 2 cases amputation of the forearm became necessary. The reports are unsatisfactory in relation to the amount of mobility left in the hand, and the cases are now under investigation with reference to this point.” “ Excisions of the elbow.—The returns for three fourths of the entire period give 31.5 cases of excision of the elbow, and the results are ascertained in 286 cases. In 16 cases amputation of the arm became necessary; 62 cases terminated fatally, or 21-67 per cent., which is a mortality a fraction greater than that resulting from amputations of the arm. This result is altogether opposed to the Schleswig-Holstein and Crimean experience, and will doubtless be modified when the statistics are completed. It may be ascribed partly to the fact that the returns for the earlier period of the war include quite a large proportion of partial excisions, which are far more hazardous than complete removal of the articular surfaces.” “ Excisions of the shoulder-joint.—Nearly all of the cases that have been reported during the war have been recorded. The results are given in the following table:

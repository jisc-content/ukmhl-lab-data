The value of this method was most strikingly exemplified in this case, for we literally replaced the head of the femur in the acetabulum with the hands. “ 13. 1861, October. Dislocation on to dorsum ilii; a female, set. 31. “ 14. 1863, March. Dislocation on to dorsum ilii; a male, set. 47. “13. 1864, March. Dislocation on to dorsum ilii; a male, set. 66, knocked down in the streets, and complicated with simple fracture of the left clavicle and several of the ribs on the left side. The patient, however, completely recovered. “ 16. 1864, September. Dislocation into ischiatic notch ; a very mus- cular man, set. 32. “ All these patients were under the influence of chloroform at the time of the reduction of the dislocation. “ Thus, 6 dislocations of the femur on the dorsum ilii, 3 into the ischiatic notch, 4 into the foramen ovale, and 1 on the ramus of the pubes, were reduced by manipulation without the aid of pulleys during the last 18 years.” In ‘Schmidt’s Jahrb.,’ 1866, vol. 139, p. 311, vol. 130, p. 34, Prof. Streubel gives a very full description of the mechanism of dislocations of the patella. The communication is prefaced by an historical account of the matter on this head which is to be found in the writings of former authors, and of 2 cases which occurred in the author’s own practice. He then proceeds to give directions for the production of this dislocation in the dead subject. These directions are, perhaps, too long for us to give here, since, doubtless, any one who wished to under- take this study would prefer to consult the original or an exact transla- tion from it. Suffice it to say that Prof. Streubel describes two ways of producing this dislocation on the dead body, one by means of an ingenious machine for applying screw-pressure directly to the patella, and thus forcing it out of the joint, and the other by movements applied to the leg. This latter requires great force. He only succeeded by either direct or indirect violence in producing the displacement on to the outer condyle. These experiments prove that dislocation, even incomplete, of the patella cannot take place without laceration of the

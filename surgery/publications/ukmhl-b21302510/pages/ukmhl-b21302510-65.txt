CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS. 55 [We regret that it is impossible, our space being exhausted, to find room for an excellent and most suggestive paper by Dr. B. W. Richard- son,* which it is impossible to abridge without spoiling it. The injection of a compound nutrient fluid into the Areins, by a most in- genious apparatus which Dr. Richardson has invented, is a peculiarly promising proposal; and the whole paper is replete with interest.] Other papers, &c., on various questions connected with cholera are the following: Bennet, Dr. Risdon, treatment of cholera collapse (‘ Brit.

Cerebrospinal Meningitis, f The epidemic appearance of this disease in Germany commenced, upon a very limited scale during 1863, when it showed itself in Silesia. In the spring and summer of 1864 it appeared at Stettin, Brunswick, Bromberg (in West Prussia), and at Berlin, with some severity. A very limited number of cases again occurred in West Prussia in December, 1864. But in the end of January or beginning of February, 1865, an outbreak of considerable extent had occurred some 30 miles south-west * “On the Physiological Formula of Cholera, and of the Treatment,” ‘Med.

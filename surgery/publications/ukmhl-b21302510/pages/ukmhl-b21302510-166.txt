REPORT ON PRACTICAL MEDICINE. 156 complications. Termination by complete reabsorption of tbe fluid eflusion is quite the rule; the process is often completed in simple pleurisy, even with considerable effusion, in a few days; in other cases the remaining products, in the form of layers of lymph, adhesions, &c. by their contraction produce curvature of the spine ; or otherwise, if there be frequent relapses and a gradual increase, may under circum- stances prove the most powerful cause of pulmonary tubercle. Such children seldom recover perfectly; they have frequent attacks of bron- chial catarrh ; their complexion is pale, with a tendency to yellowness, they have palpitation of the heart, and great fatigue after slight exertion. The termination of pleurisy in empyema is in children generally less dangerous than in adults. Prognosis is more favorable in primary than in secondary pleurisy, and in the latter'the degree of danger is to be measured by the severity of the primary pleurisy ; but the prognosis is fatal in secondary pleurisy in the course of pyaemia. The treatment of pleurisy in children is not different in principle from that of the same disease in adults.

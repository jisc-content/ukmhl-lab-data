WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. 3.‘31 the employment of stitches becomes necessary in extensive incised or lacerated wounds. In sewing such wounds, the needle may be introduced from the interior of the wound, outwards, so as to avoid perforating any portion of the intes- tine, which sometimes insinuates itself between the edges of the wound without protruding externally. Of the utility of sutures in some wounds of the abdominal parietes, I am fully satisfied both from experience and from the observation of others, but it is proper to state that Baron Larrey has depre- cated in strong terms the employment of gastroraphy. He speaks of it as an operation which ought to be banished from surgery, and even goes so far as to attribute the bad results of the Cesarean operation to this piece of after-treatment. We all know how' strong and indelible early impressions are liable to become, and with all possible respect for the Baron’s opi- nion, I cannot avoid thinking that he has taken up a hasty prejudice, upon this point, from having witnessed the bad ef- fects of sutures in a case treated by his uncle, where a maniac had made an extensive wound into his own belly. It is, at the same time, but justice to Baron Larrey, to state, that he assigns reasons for objecting to the use of sutures in abdominal wounds, and particularly the difficulty of supporting the stitches by compress and bandage for want of a solid point of resistance in the subjacent parts ; this, however, may be held by others as well as by myself an additional reason for having recourse to sutures. In gunshot wounds of the abdomen, the orifices made by the entrance and exit of the ball, are, as in other cases, to be covered with light and simple dressings; in wounds made by musket balls, there is seldom or never any tend- ency to protrusion of the viscera, and of course no sur- gical expedient is necessary to obviate this occurrence. Wherever balls, pieces of wadding, cloth, or other extraneous substances are felt within reach of the external orifice, it

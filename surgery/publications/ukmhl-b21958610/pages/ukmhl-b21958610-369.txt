In commenting upon one of these cases, I have elsewhere expressed myself to the following effect:— “ My observations on this case were chiefly intended to apprize you of what I have found to be the most common difficulties in the treatment of this disease. First, The diagnosis be- tween the hernia and those tumours with which it is liable to be confounded; and, secondly, the diagnosis between the hernial sac and its contents. t; In illustration of the former point, I noticed several mis- takes which had fallen under my own observation, and in- ; stanecd two cases in which every thing was prepared, and the surgeon about to operate, when I had the good fortune to sus- pend his proceedings; and both cases turned out to be glandular swellings in the groin, accompanied with an accidental obstruc- tion of the oowels, and some febrile excitement in the system. “ In illustration of the second point, the difficulty of dis- tinguishing between the hernial sac, and the bowel which it contains, 1 mentioned to you that in one of my earlier opera- tions for a strangulated femoral hernia, where the tumour was very small, and the fascia propria thick, I mistook the latter for the hernial sac, dilated the stricture in the crural arch, and pushed up what I conceived to be the intestine into the cavity of the abdomen ; but the symptoms of strangulation continu- ing, my patient died, and on dissection, I had the mortification to find a small portion of the ileum still strangulated in the neck of the sac. “ When the sac has been successfully opened, and its con- tents fairly displayed, the difficulty of the operation is in a

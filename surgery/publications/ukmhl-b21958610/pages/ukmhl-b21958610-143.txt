INFLAMMATION. 123 of the two latter; and we now speak of several other pro- cesses, such as adhesion, effusion, ulceration, granulation, &c. as the results or concomitants of inflammatory action. Resolution is in general the most desirable termination ; and when complete, the symptoms, both constitutional and lo- cal, gradually decline, the increased action of the vessels of tthe inflamed part subsides, and, without any considerable or (obvious evacuation taking place, the inflamed part gradually 1 resumes its natural state and its proper functions. This is, in fact, the spontaneous cure of inflammation ; and while it is â€¢ sometimes altogether the work of nature, it may, at the same t time, be greatly promoted by art. Effusion is that effect of inflammation in which the fluid i naturally poured out by the exhalant vessels, from the sur- face of the serous membranes, is separated in a superabundant (quantity ; and this is a very common result of an inflamed ; state of such membranes, giving rise to hydrocephalus in the 'head, hydrothorax in the chest, ascites in the abdomen, and (anasarca in the limbs; in which latter case the fluid occupies (the cellular membrane. The process of Adhesion, another result of inflammation, is one of great importance to the surgeon ; it is to this process to which we look for the cure of many formidable wounds; it is upon this process we depend for reunion of the parts after the removal of morbid excrescences, and after the am- putation of limbs. Although, in a great proportion of cases, it is our purpose to promote this as a salutary process, we are 'Sometimes called upon to obviate the consequences of preter- natural adhesion, as producing hideous deformities, as imped- ing the motions of limbs, or interrupting the salutary func- tions of organs. Union by adhesion, or what has, ever since the days of Galen, been termed, union by the first inten- tion, has been considered under two different conditions: when the part divided by fracture, rupture, laceration, or

421 AMPUTATION. operation has been performed, the results have been most sa- tisfactory. In amputating the leg between the knee and ankle-joints, the operation which I have almost exclusively seen and prac- tised for the last ten years is that of Loudham and Verduin, a complete account of which is given in Massuet’s Treatise “ De L’Amputation a Lambeau.” In this operation a large Hap, sufficient to cover the extremity of the bones, is formed from the muscles on the posterior surface of the leg. Here it must be observed, that in a very brawny limb, or in amputat- ing high up towards the knee, it is necessary to guard against a superfluity of muscle, either by cutting from with- out inwards and retracting the skin before forming the mus- cular flap, or by .passing the catline through the limb at some distance behind the bones, so as to exclude a portion of the muscular substance from the flap, leaving it to he after- wards divided by a circular turn of the knife. In this am- putation the flap does not meet a corresponding Hap from the opposite side of the limb, but the muscular substance is turned completely round the extremity of the bone, and it will be observed that every exterior layer of muscular sub- stance has to form an arc of a larger circle than the one im- mediately within, while the integuments, in order to cover the subjacent muscle, must form an arc of a circle of still larger diameter. This leads me to observe, that this ope- ration is, for the most part, executed most neatly and success- fully when performed as a secondary amputation in a limb shrunk and wasted from previous disease, than as a primary amputation in consequence of an accident. In a case of the latter kind, I once saw the muscular substance so redundant, that the integuments were with great difficulty brought to cover it; the stricture was so great that the stump rapidly sloughed and the patient died. This is indeed but one of many cases in which I have seen bad consequences from a

MILITARY SURGERY. larger quantities, I have generally found it become offensive 490 to medical advice in the very early stage of the affection, that we have an opportunity of putting in practice this means of relief. In all such cases, when the constitution is hale, and the patient young, I am disposed to recommend general bleed- ing, observing at the same time that in proportion as the attack has been of longer duration, and more frequently repeated, bleeding becomes less necessary and less efficacious. The use of purgatives to any great extent, in the treatment of gonorrhoea, is by no means an eligible practice. When an opportunity is afforded of employing them in a very early stage of the affec- tion, they will in this, as in most other inflammatory af- fections, materially promote our views ; but from the repeated and long continued use of purgatives I may safely assert that no good effect is to be expected, and many instances occur of the disease being prolonged, or terminating in gleet, from patients trying to cure themselves by purgatives. Where much constitutional excitement takes place, marked by quick pulse, and hot skin, accompanied by local irritation, frequent calls to urine, pain and scalding, I know of no constitu- tional remedy more efficacious than the warm bath at a moderate temperature, from 90 to 100, and continued from 20 minutes to half an hour or longer. This is a remedy from which patients seldom fail to experience the highest gratification, and which is generally followed by an alleviation of the urgent symptoms both constitutional and local. Before proceeding to consider the use of local remedies, I may here mention some medicines which are administered internally for the cure of gonorrhoea, and which are thought to have a specific influence on this disease. Of these, the prin- cipal are the balsam of copaiba and the cubeb pepper; the for- mer may be given in doses of from half a drachm to two drachms, three times a-day, either simply dropped on a piece of loaf sugar, or combined with some common emulsion.

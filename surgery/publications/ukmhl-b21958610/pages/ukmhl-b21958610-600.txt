MILITARY SURGERY. 5H0 insensible to the action of light, they are in fictitious cases obedient to this stimulus; and individuals have been roused from a feigned paroxysm of epilepsy by dropping into the eye a few drops of alcohol, or any acrid liquid ; by blowing into the nostrils some pungent snuff; by sud- denly dashing a bucket of cold water over them; or by applying to the skin a spatula or piece of cloth dipped in boiling water. Fictitious epileptics have also occasion- ally betrayed themselves by opening their eyes, evidently for the purpose of observing tbe effects of their gesticulations on the bystanders; or by adopting certain suggestions as to the nature of real epileptic fits, which have been purposely thrown out in their hearing by expert and intelligent surgeons with a view to mislead them. Partial convulsive affections, if feigned, are for the most part readily exposed by protracted watching, it being impos- sible for the impostor to keep up an incessant muscular action without exhausting himself; and when it is pretended that such affections come on periodically, the suspected person should be placed, as if accidentally, in a situation where he can be overlooked without his being at all aware that he is under ob- servation ; in such a situation he will not continue the sem- blance of diseased when he can expect no impression to be made even by the reality. Paralytic affections, it may be observed, unless dependent upon some obvious organic lesion, are but little incident to men at that time of life, when they are usually called upon to serve as soldiers or seamen. The general appearance of paralytic limbs is well known ; and when this disease has been feigned, impostors have occasionally been detected by the application of strong and unusual stimuli, particularly the electric shock, or by approaching the individual cautiously during sleep, and tickling him in such a way as will induce him to move the pretended paralytic limb.

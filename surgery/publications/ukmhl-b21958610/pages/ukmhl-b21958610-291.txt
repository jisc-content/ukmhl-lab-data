•ANEURIS5I. 271 ::hc coagulum is again gradually absorbed, and the artery and tithe sac contract until the one assumes the appearance of a Ligamentous cord, and the other that of a small fleshy tumour. Ifn all artificial attempts towards the cure of aneurism, we have iat in view to assist nature in accomplishing the cure by this Hast mentioned process, by the deposition of coagulum, not only in the sac but in the contiguous portions of the artery Leading to a permanent obstruction of its canal, and leaving tihe blood to find its way to the more distant parts of the limb by collateral channels, by the gradual enlargement of the contiguous small arteries, and their anastomoses with those in tithe more distant part of the extremity. The treatment of aneurism may be divided into medical and surgical ; the former consists essentially of bleeding, low diet, .land abstinence from all excitement of the vascular system by ex- ercise or otherwise, and is the only means we have in our power eof promoting the cure of internal aneurisms. The surgical treat- nnent of this disease, applicable to aneurisms of the extremities, ^consists of pressure; or of an operation by which the trunk of the artery is laid bare and tied, the flow of blood into the sac 1 moderated or obstructed, and an opportunity given for the formation of the coagulum, by which the cure is finally ac- complished. There are cases in which compression has effect- ed a cure, but it is to be observed, that it is in certain stages of aneurism only that it can be advantageously or even safely applied. If there be any inflammation of the aneurismal sac indicated by pain on pressure, it becomes dangerous to employ it; and when used, it is to be applied not only to the surface ^of the tumour, but to the whole member, by means of a roller. ; Prior to the year 17115, the operation practised for the cure of aneurism was pregnant with difficulty and danger, so much so that Mr. Pott, after forty years’ practice, declared, that until a better mode of treating the disease was discovered, amputation was the only resource in cases of popliteal aneurism.

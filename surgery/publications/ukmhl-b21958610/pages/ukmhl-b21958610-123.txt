transportation of sick and m ounded. 103 bulky articles that are required by an army, or sick and wounded men, with greater comfort and ease than can pos- sibly be afforded by the spring-waggon.” Mr. Cherry’s objections to this last-mentioned mode of i conveyance are detailed at length, and arc for the most part, II think, exceedingly well-founded. He very justly observes, lithat “ The ease and comfort procured to the sick and wound- ed soldier, by the spring-waggon conveyance, does not equal what it is sometimes supposed to do ; and therefore cannot on that score be said to compensate for any additional burden or expense.” “ The ease resulting from the elasticity of springs to a car- riage, particularly belongs to rapid motion over made roads. In very rough situations their effect is lost; and, under the most favourable circumstances, the production of ease depends upon a proper adjustment of the strength of the springs to the weight to be carried on them. The tvorst cases of sickness or wounds, of course, require the most ease in being moved ; but in spring-waggons they receive the least. The waggon is calculated to carry seven or eight men with ordinary com- plaints, and with the weight of these the springs may act; but when the M'aggon is occupied by one, or even two men, who, when very ill or badly wounded, are fully sufficient to occupy an entire waggon, their weight is not sufficient to act on the elasticity of the springs, and they M'ould ride quite as easy in a carriage M'ithout any. Was the strength of the springs, again, adapted to this lesser weight, their elasticity would be overcome by the greater, so that in cither one case or the other, the persons conveyed in spring-waggons are placed in a similar situation to what they would be on a car- riage M'ithout springs.” After noticing the impediments which not unfrequently occur to the movements of troops, from the breaking down or •sticking fast of waggons in bad roads, bridges, hollow ways,

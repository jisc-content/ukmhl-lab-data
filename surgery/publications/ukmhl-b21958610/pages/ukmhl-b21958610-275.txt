255 WOUNDS OP THK ARTERIES. The Torsion or twisting the extremity of a bleeding artery, ‘ so as to reduce it to a state somewhat similar to that in 1 which we find arteries torn across, without haemorrhage, is i a practice which has been recently introduced, and which 1 have seen several times employed in small-sized arteries. It is a practice however of which I have no personal expe- rrience, nor am I likely to have much, while I see so few' i objections to the use ot the ligature, and so much reason to ! be satisfied with the security which it affords. The Ligature of arteries is a practice which, if it possesses a superiority over every other in the surgery of civil life, is ’’of still more importance in the treatment of those haemor- rhages which it often becomes the business of the military -surgeon to suppress. Here we have no time to lose in trying .'successively various expedients for effecting our purpose ; it is our duty to adopt at once the most speedy and secure; more .■especially as we are often destitute of intelligent professional assistants whom we might appoint to watch the wounded, and tto whom we might intrust the patient’s safety in the event of a renewal of the hemorrhage,—above all, we are often uncer- :tain how soon an exertion may be required on the part of the patient, totally incompatible with that tranquillity and repose •■so necessary to the success of all the other expedients for the suppression of haemorrhage. Nothing can here be made too secure ; we may be speedily compelled to move with our pa- tients, or to remove from them. In either case it will be well or us not to have trusted to a less certain mode of effecting >ur purpose, when a more infallible one was within our reach. The best mode of tying arteries, and the immediate effects of rhe ligature, have been subjects warmly discussed by modern urgeons. I rom a series of experiments instituted in this place »y the late Doctor Jones, he was led to infer that the first step f the process employed by nature in the permanent sup-

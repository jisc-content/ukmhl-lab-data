It is necessary to observe that this amputation below the knee is frequently performed by the circular incision, and that there is also a third mode of operating by two lateral flaps, which, it appears, has long been shown by Mr. Brooks in his courses of lectures, and of which I am in possession of a minute detail in a letter from Mr. Brooks to Mr. Cop- land Hutchison, written at my request, some years ago. But as I consider the single flap operation, when carefully ex- ecuted, to be by far the most eligible mode of amputating the leg, it seems unnecessary to enter into the subject farther in this outline. The general remarks which were made in regard to the two most common modes of operating in the removal of limbs, may be considered as more peculiarly applicable to Amputations of the thigh, and this is one of the cases in which we see either operation frequently executed with success; it is one of those cases in which the surgeon will be very much guid- ed by his general estimate of their respective advantages; and it may be remarked, that in no other instance is the superior facility and rapidity with which the flap operation may be executed more conspicuous than here. Indeed the rapidity with which this operation is frequently performed, is some- times alleged as an objection to it; but this is an objection in which I do not concur ; for although the maxim, â€œ sat cito si sat bene," is an excellent one in surgery, yet, we may say, with equal truth, that if an operation is well done, it can scarcely be done too quickly, a sentiment in which the pa- tient will always concur. The only points upon which it seems necessary to remark particularly in regard to amputa- tions of the thigh, is the mode of forming the flaps, and dressing the stump after the circular operation, and both these points I have noticed in the following extract from a Clinical Lecture.

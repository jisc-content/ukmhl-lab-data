ULCERS. 159 as we learn from Knox’s account of the American Campaigns Ii under Lord Amherst and General Wolfe, and is said to be • still in use amongst the seamen employed in the whale fishery. The good effects expected, and said to be observed from this i remedy, are probably attributable more to its influence on the iminds than on the bodies of scorbutic patients, who, to say Ii nothing of the superstitious character of seamen, arc often of a imost desponding turn, likely to be benefited by any mea- s sures which show an interest in their fate, or which they can be led to look upon as a means of cure ; and it w ill be ob- > served, the very employment of the earth-bath necessarily implies a communication with the shore, the most effectual of all means of counteracting scurvy.

This has been more particularly observed with i regard to dysenteric complaints, and to ulcers of the legs, the latter often originating from the most trivial scratches or ac- c cidental wounds, and even from the bites of minute insects. This last mentioned cause I have known to be productive of t the loss of several lives, and of many limbs, sometimes ren- i dering their removal by amputation necessaiy, and at other : times leading to such extensive sloughing of the muscular and : tendinous parts, as to produce irremediable contractions and distortions of the limb.

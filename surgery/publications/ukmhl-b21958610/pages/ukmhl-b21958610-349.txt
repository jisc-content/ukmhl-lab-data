329 "WOUNDS OF THF. ABDOMEN. voided soon after the infliction of wounds of the abdomen, in- dicate lesions of the lower intestine, of the kidneys, or of the urinary bladder. When we consider the variety of organs contained in the abdomen, the great vascularity of some of them, as the liver and spleen, the acrid and irritating contents of others, as the gall and urinary bladders, the paramount importance of others, as the stomach, we see how readily patients arc cut off by hae- morrhage from the first, by effusion from the second, and by a suspension of the functions of the third. The extensive sympathy existing between the abdominal viscera and other parts of the system through the medium of the great sympa- thetic nerve, is a circumstance which accounts for many phe- nomena occurring in wounds of these viscera, and which often leads to the death of the patient, even sooner than he would sink from inanition, by a suspension of the functions of the stomach, or by the accession of inflammation of the peritoneum. To the peculiar liability of this membrane to inflame, I have already observed that much of the danger, and many of the fatal terminations of abdominal wounds are to be ascribed; but like other serous membranes, the form of inflammation which the peritoneum is most liable to assume is the adhesive; while the membrane lining the intestinal tube, like others of the mucous class, is most liable to the ulcerative inflammation. And here, as Mr. Travers has well observed, we have an irre- sistible evidence of the salutary provision of nature against the effects of disease. If the inflamed peritoneum had run directly into suppuration, ulceration of the containing parts would have been necessary for an outlet; and if the internal surface of the irritated bowel had tended to form adhesions, the canal would have been in frequent danger of obliteration. Before proceeding to consider more particularly wounds of the floating, or what may be termed the tubular viscera of the abdomen, 1 shall advert to wounds of the parietes of the belly,

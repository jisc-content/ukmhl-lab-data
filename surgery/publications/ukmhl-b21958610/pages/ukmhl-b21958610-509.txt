489 OONORRHOEA. a number of different and apparently contradictory indica- tions ; in the hands of ignorance, temerity, or indiscretion, it will certainly do more harm than good. GONORRHOEA. The word Gonorrhoea implies a discharge of seminal fluid, and is obviously misapplied in so far as it is generally em- ployed to denote a puriform discharge from the urethra. No practical inconvenience, however, now occurs from the em- ployment of the word in this latter sense, and as it is not my ambition to remodel the language of medicine, but to convey useful information, I would proceed, without dwelling on the early history of the disease, to a question of some practical moment, and which was at one time keenly agitated, namely, the identity of the gonorrhoeal and syphilitic poisons. For many years the sameness of these affections was hardly questioned, and practitioners believed that both were to be cured by the same remedies. The use of mercury, how- ever, which after its first introduction into practice was long held specific in the cure of syphilis, was observed to be given without a proportionate benefit in gonorrhoea, and perhaps it was this which first suggested a doubt of the identity of the two diseases, a doubt which has gradually grown, notwith- standing the ingenious speculations of Mr. Hunter, into a ge- neral conviction of the diversity of the two poisons. Those who argue for the identity of the two diseases, at the head of whom is the distinguished author just named, account for the different phenomena which they present, the ulceration oc- curring externally in syphilis, and the discharge of purulent matter without ulceration in gonorrhoea, by adverting to the different texture and functions of the parts affected.

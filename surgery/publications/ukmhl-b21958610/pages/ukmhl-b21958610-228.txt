208 MILITARY SURGERY. in the centre, which slit being placed over the wound, one of the heads is passed through it, and both ends of the roller be- ing pulled tight, the edges of the wound are approximated and retained in this situation. It is obvious that wherever this bandage can be applied with effect, it must have a very power- ful influence in fulfilling the intention with which it is em- ployed ; it is equally obvious, however, that its application is very much limited to the case of wrounds, extending longitu- dinally in the course of the trunk or limbs, and in such cases the edges of the wound having little tendency to retract, there can be no necessity for having recourse to a contrivance in any degree complicated for retaining them in contact. This form of roller has therefore, in this country at least, gradually given place to the common single-headed roller, or the eighteen-tailed bandage, either of which are capable of effect- ing all that bandaging can effect in the cure of recent wounds. In dressing wounds of the head,and those extending transverse- ly across the trunk or extremities, bandages are employed chief- ly with a view of retaining the dressings ; and here it is obvious that the form and size of the bandage must vary according to the direction, the extent, and nature of the wound. The due application of the bandages can only be learned from experi- ence ; and although there are many cases in surgery, particu- larly cases of sinuous ulcers, in which a bandage artfully ap- plied is of essential service in promoting the cure, recent wounds can scarcely be considered as cases which are to be greatly benefited by this means. In longitudinal wounds of the limbs, the only ones perhaps in which we could employ ban- dages with a powerful effect, there is comparatively little ten- dency to retraction, and here therefore they are comparatively less necessary. Nothing indeed can be more preposterous than applying bandages to such wounds with immoderate tightness, for if the bandage be tight on its first application, a danger-

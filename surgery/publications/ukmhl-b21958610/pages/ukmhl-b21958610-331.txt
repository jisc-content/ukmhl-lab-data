311 WOUNDS OF THE FACE AND NECK. â€¢external wound, have surprised me more than most things which I have had occasion to witness in the practice of my profession. The numerous parts of importance which lie on the fore or sternal aspect of the neck, the large blood-vessels and nerves, the respiratory and alimentary tubes which occupy this re- gion, render its wounds extremely hazardous. In adverting to the relative situation of the trachea and of the carotid ar- teries which are here so much exposed to injury, we may re- mark that the large blood-vessels gradually recede backwards as they advance upwards, or rather that the prominence of the larynx or pomum adami, exposes it more immediately to wounds in the upper part of the neck, and in some degree protects the arteries from injury. Hence the frequent escape of these vessels in attempts at suicide, in consequence of the incisions being made too high. Wounds of the larynx and trachea, although difficult to heal, and liable to give rise to inflammation which may ex- tend downwards into the bronchial, are not in the first instance peculiarly dangerous. In simple incised wounds of this kind, attempts to heal them by the first intention are sometimes successful, and should always be made; but it often happens that after having brought the edges of the wound into accu- rate approximation by plasters or stitches, we are again, in consequence of the irritation, or of emphysema in the neigh- bourhood of the wound, compelled to throw it open, and to permit the patient to breathe through the aperture. We have examples of both the trachea and oesophagus being opened at once by the same wound, and in some rare cases, one of which I had an opportunity of seeing, both these tubes were completely divided by an incised wound. The wound in each of the canals became fistulous, the patient breathed through a silver tube which he wore in the trachea, and which at the time of his meals was withdrawn to make room for the introduction of an

413 AMPUTATION. breadth of its base, the quantity of cut surface exposed by this operation would be rather more than double that exposed by the former. Or, in other words, “ Supposing the limb to be cut represented by a cylinder three inches in diameter, then, if the section be made at right angles to its length, the area of the surface exposed will be 7-05 inches nearly.” If the section be made, again, by two flaps of the proportions formerly men- tioned, “ the area of the surface exposed will be 15.5 inches nearly, being the area of an ellipsis formed by the section of a cylinder whose length is twice its diameter.” The above, however, can only be considered as an approximation to the truth, inasmuch as the double circular incision exposes a some- what larger surface than the direct transverse section of a limb, and inasmuch as some of the limbs, the thigh particu- larly, can scarcely be considered as a cylinder, but a gently ta- pering cone. The next and perhaps one of the most important points of view in which the two operations may be compared, is, the covering left for the extremity of the bone, and the fa- vourable state of the parts for an accurate approximation and speedy healing of the wound. In both these respects the flap operation offers great advantages, according to the views en- tertained and the practice followed by the surgeons of this country. But, should circumstances occur to prevent union by the first intention, it is obvious, from what has been said, that the flap operation will leave nearly double the quantity of suppurating surface. In operating by the double flap, it will easily be understood that the blood-vessels are often cut obliquely; sometimes, indeed, they may be seen scooped like a writing pen ; and although this may be of no great moment, when these vessels are carefully and accurately secured with ligatures, yet this is obviously a division of the vessel which is unfavourable to its retraction and rapid closure ; and if, in consequence of the faintness of the patient, a vessel should not

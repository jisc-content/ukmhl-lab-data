MILITARY SURGERY. 28G and in a case detailed in the second volume of the Mcdico- Chirurgical Transactions, by Mr. Harkness of Ratcliffe, the patient continued to take for a period of twenty-six days, at the rate of one ounce of laudanum daily, besides a very li- beral supply of wine and porter. Indeed, as I conceive it right in every instance of tetanus to give a trial to opium, it seems to me equally right to push it at once with an unsparing hand to the fullest extent; the risk which a pa- tient may run from an overdose of the medicine can scarcely exceed the risk which he runs from the uncontrolled progress of the disease. One of the remedies which has lately been most confidently spoken of in the cure of tetanus, is an infu- sion of tobacco in the form of a bath ; and several very inter- esting cases in support of this practice are detailed by Dr. Anderson of Trinidad, in the first and second volumes of the Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh. Of the local applications to lacerated or punctured wounds complicated with tetanus, warm anodyne fomentations, and large emollient cataplasms, are perhaps the best; but besides these, blisters in the immediate neighbourhood of the wound, or the blistering ointment applied to the wound itself, have been employed for the purpose of re-establishing the purulent secretion, which, in cases of tetanus, has b&en observed to be altered, interrupted, or suppressed. Baron Larrey has, in conformity with his views of the disease, recommended the use of caustics, actual and potential, both in the neighbour- hood of the wound and along the course of the spine. When the foreefoinrr measures fail to make a favourable impression on the disease, it is not surprising that the di- vision of the principal nervous trunks supplying the wounded part, or the removal of the limb, should have been attempted. These are steps which, from the fullest consideration of the evidence both for and against the measure, we have no very great encouragement to undertake; at the same time, if prac-

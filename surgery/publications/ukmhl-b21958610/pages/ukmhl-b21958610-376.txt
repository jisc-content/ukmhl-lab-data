MILITARY SURGERY. 35G ly enabled to devote himself to agricultural pursuits, in which lie had been formerly employed.'” A case still more remarkable, inasmuch as the artery was divided along with the bone, was communicated to me by Mr. Stevenson of the Madras Army ; and the following is an abstract of it from a minute diary kept by Mr. Stevenson. A Jemadar of the Nabob of Masulipatam, received a sabre wound, passing obliquely across the arm, dividing the belly of the biceps muscle and the bone. The attendants described the stream of blood as having been very profuse, and projected several feet, from which circumstance, and the absence of all pulsation at the wrist, it was concluded that the artery was divided. The haemorrhage was stayed in the first instance by a turban wrapped tightly round the arm ; and as the Na- bob firmly opposed the amputation of the man’s limb, the turban was cautiously removed, the lips of the wound approxi- mated, a splint placed under the arm, and a tourniquet ap- plied loosely on the upper part of it. No haemorrhage super- vened, the pulse was barely perceptible at the wrist on the third day. On the twenty-sixth day the wound was nearly all cicatrised, and on the forty-fifth the bone was firmly united ; but as might have been expected, the arm that was saved proved of little use. In punctured wounds of the extremities, it may be remark- ed, that the bayonet, or pike, even when it passes completely through, does not penetrate the member in its longest dia- meter, the point being turned to one side or the other by the bone ; and hence the muscles directly opposed to each other can seldom be implicated in the same wound. The danger from immediate haem or rh age in punctured wounds is greatly less than that from incised wounds, even when the principal blood-vessels are opened, because the nature of this wound affords a much less ready exit to the blood, and ren- ders more effectual those expedients naturally resorted to

These changes have taken place several times, and the methods of cure adopted in the two countries at the present hour are in illustration ot the fact; for while we are endeavouring to prove the inutility, if not the danger of mercurial remedies, it is well known, that in some of the principal establishments in France, one preparation alone, and that the most powerful, the muriate of mercury, is relied on almost universally for the cure ot vene- real disorders.

Of its powers in any way I cannot convey my own opinion in language more energetic than that of the late Dr. Fordyce of London, who recommended to his pupils to prescribe it in the shape of “ a pudding or a pyc” Of the many publications which have at different times issued from the press in order to prove, u that there are ac- tually, in rerum natura, such remedies and antidotes as will free us from the venereal disease without the aid of mer- cury,” the most singular is that published in 1709 by J.

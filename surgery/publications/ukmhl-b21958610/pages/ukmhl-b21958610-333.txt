The expanded surface of the thorax renders wounds of this region very frequent in battle, while the vital importance of the organs lodged within it render them also peculiarly dan- gerous. It has already been observed that the head and up- per part of the trunk are particularly exposed to sabre wounds in rencontres amongst the cavalry ; while the common error, particularly of young soldiers, in levelling too high, may be considered as a circumstance more particularly exposing this cavity to wounds from fire-arms. Superficial wounds of the thoracic region offer nothing very peculiar in their character, nor do they require any particular mode of treatment, if we except the great caution requisite to prevent the inflammation extending to the pleura, the heart, or the lungs. From the contiguity of these important parts, wounds of the thorax, even although not of a very alarming appearance, have occasionally, particularly in those predisposed to pulmonary complaints, terminated fatally, and these fatal terminations are liable to become more frequent in conse- quence of the wounded soldier lying exposed, as he often must do, to the inclemencies of the weather. As an encouraging example, however, to show the very desperate wounds of the thoracic region from which patients occasionally recover, even under the disadvantages of season and external circumstances, I may refer to that of a private of the Royal Artillery, who was wounded by a twenty-four pound shot, while employed in the

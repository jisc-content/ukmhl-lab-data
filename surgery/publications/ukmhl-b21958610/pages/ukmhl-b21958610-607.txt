In judging of such cases, a medical officer will naturally be guid- ed by a consideration of the nature, site, and extent of the wound, its correspondence with the alleged cause, and other collateral circumstances. But the difficulty of forming a cor- rect judgment in such cases may be estimated by the follow- ing occurrence in the French army after the battles of Lutzen and Bautzen, in which it appears that 2632 soldiers were slightly wounded in the hands ; suspicions having arisen that the wounds were voluntarily inflicted, a board of medical officers, at the head of which was Baron Larrey, was assembled by order of Napoleon, to investigate the circumstances attend- ing these wounds; but, after mature inquiry and deliberation, the board came to the conclusion, that it was impossible to distinguish between wounds occasioned by the fire of an enemy and those voluntarily inflicted, and, consequently, they report- ed that there was no satisfactory proof that any of the soldiers under examination had mutilated themselves. An effectual provision against future acts of mutilation will probably be found in the 26th and 27th clauses of the pensioning warrant, formerly referred to, by which it is provided, that “ every sol- dier maimed by the firing off of his musket, or by other means, and who thereby becomes unfit for service, whether the injury occurred on or off duty, whether accidentally or intentionally, shall in all cases be tried by a district court martial, as soon after the event as possible.” The soldier’s claim to discharge or to pension, and even his exemption from punishment, depends on the decision of the court.

MILITARY SURGERY. 228 still more remarkable, aiul perhaps less easily explained, is, that halls, after penetrating the thorax or abdomen, sometimes take the internal contour of these cavities, and pass round from one point to another, grazing the pleura or peritonaeum, without injuring the contained viscera. This fact, so far as I know, was first noticed by Fondacq, who reports a case in which a ball coursed round the interior of the thorax, but without wounding the lungs ; it is a circumstance which I cannot vouch for from personal experience, but it is amply confirmed by the observations of Dr. Hennen, who refers to six fatal cases which he had carefully examined. In two of these cases, balls had entered on the right of the sternum, coursed round between the pleura and lungs, and passed out near the spine; in two others, balls had entered close to the umbilicus, and passed out exactly opposite, beside the spine, without wounding any important organ; in the other two cases, balls had entered over the region of the spleen, and after having passed round a considerable portion of the cavity, without wounding its contents, were found lodged in a distant part of the abdomen. A remarkable case of this kind was recently stated to me by Mr. Gulliver of the 71st Regiment, in which a musket ball was found lodged in the posterior surface of the sternum, without having passed through the bone, but having entered at a dis- tant part of the thorax. The fact of balls coursing along the interior or concave sur- face of the limbs in a state of flexion, has been long known to military surgeons; and all the practical writers abound writh instances in which balls have been lodged in parts of the ex- tremities far from their entrance. In such cases, the course of the missile is often regulated by the particular position of the limb at the time of receiving the shot, and hence the practi- cal rule in searching for lodged balls, to place the body or limb as much as possible in the position in which it is supposed to have been injured.

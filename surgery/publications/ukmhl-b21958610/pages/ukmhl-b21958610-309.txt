289 WOUNDS OF THE HEAD. In the treatment of simple incised and lacerated wounds of the scalp, when the cranium, the brain, and its membranes have not sustained any injury, the wound, however formidable it may appear from its length, does not bear any proportion- ate depth,—it is wholly within our view, is easily accessible to every necessary examination, and readily admits of the re- moval of foreign bodies, or whatever other steps may be ne- cessary, previous to our bringing its edges into apposition ; hence, such wounds are free from some of those difficulties which we experience in the treatment of wounds in other parts of the body. The saving of every portion of integuments which may be detached from the subjacent bone, in consequence of incised or lacerated wounds of the scalp, was one of those improvements in surgery, which was almost universally adopted, so soon as it was proposed ; and it is only sur- prising that an improvement so obvious,—an improvement more and more recommended by every succeeding author,— should have been left to be brought into notice by so recent a writer as Mr. Pott; for although some insulated cases, in fa- vour of this practice, may be picked out from preceding writers, it was the good sense and authoritative character of Mr. Pott, which led to the general practice of saving and re- placing portions of the scalp detached by accidental wounds. It is singular, however, that Mr. Pott, who saw so distinct- ly, and inculcated so forcibly the propriety of laying down the scalp in such cases, and promoting its adhesion, should have failed to extend his principles to those cases in which the scalp is artificially and purposely raised to admit of a more per- fect examination of the bone, or to make room for the applicr- tion of the trepan. We are now so well aware of the use of the scalp in affording protection and nourishment to the subjacent parts, as well as in accelerating the cure, that we have no hesi- tation in extending to all wounds of this region, whether inter.- u t

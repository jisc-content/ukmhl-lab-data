215 WOUNDS OF 1HE ARTERIES. Mistakes, the danger of trusting a matter of this importance to inexperienced youths, and of delegating the proper duty and responsibility of the surgeon to non-professional assist- ants, have prevented this recommendation from being acted ■on to any great extent. Previously to the invention of the tourniquet, its place was •supplied by the powerful gripe of an assistant, and we find some of the older surgeons complimenting each other on the . effectual manner in which they suppressed the haemorrhage in cases of amputation by grasping the upper part of the limb. In very recent times the practice of compression by the hand of an assistant has again been revived, and it becomes mili- tary men above all others to make themselves familiar with this practice, and thereby to render themselves as far as possible independent of complex instruments or extraneous re- sources. The error of supposing it impossible to make an ef- fectual compression on the main artery of a limb, so as to re- strain its bleeding, has of late been abundantly exposed by 'Mr. Guthrie; and wherever the pressure does not require to be protracted, there can be no better method of making it than by the hand of the surgeon or his assistant. But a plan of permanently suppressing haemorrhage, confined exclusively in its operation to the opened vessels, and equally applicable to all parts of the system, has always been a desideratum to the practical surgeon. Of the means employed at different times for this purpose, II shall immediately proceed to give a summary account, but in the first place it is necessary to state that, although punc- tures or very limited wounds in the arteries, may possibly heal without obstructing the calibre of the vessel, this is an event which we are not to look for in practice, and for the accom- plishment of which, no means have been proposed since the attempts made many years ago, by Mr. Lambert of New- castle, to close the wounds of arteries by means of the twisted

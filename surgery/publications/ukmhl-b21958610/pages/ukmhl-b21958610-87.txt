PROPORTION OF SICK IN ARJIIES. G7 ease, and sometimes suffering severely from it, the gallant army which lately served in the Peninsula was kept for years together in a state of efficiency which enabled it repeatedly to conquer, and ultimately to triumph over a brave and de- termined enemy. That much of this efficiency was justly due to the zeal and ability which directed the medical concerns of that army, I hold the following fact to be an abundant proof. During the ten months from the siege of Burgos to the battle of Vittoria, inclusive, the total number of sick and wounded which passed through the hospitals was ninety-five thousand three hundred and forty-eight. By the unremitting exertions of Sir James M‘Grigor and the medical staff under his orders, the army took the field preparatory to the battle with a sick-list under five thousand. For twenty successive days it marched towards the enemy, and in less than one month after it had defeated him, mustered within thirty men as strong as before the action,—and this too without rein- forcements from England, the ranks having been recruited by convalescents. But it is in the navy, perhaps even more than in the army, that the effects of prophylactic measures, both medical and military, have had the most conspicuous influence in dimi- nishing sickness and mortality. A fleet under ordinary cir- cumstances, where the discipline and interior economy of the ships are good, the supply of warm clothing and wholesome provisions sufficient, the means of ventilation and cleanliness perfect, above all, where the officers have it in their power to keep disorder and intemperance in check, may attain a degree of health which can never be expected in an army on active sendee. A long sea voyage was formerly considered one of the most unhealthy situations to which a man could be exposed, while by the institution and enforcement of prophylactic mea- sures a ship’s company may now be conducted round the world, exposed to every vicissitude of temperature, and to all

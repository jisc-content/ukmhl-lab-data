468 MILITARY SURGERY. we are under great obligations for his description of the phagedenic and sloughing ulcers of the genitals, and for his observations on the injurious effects of mercury in their treatment: hut the practical utility of his other subdivi- sions of primary venereal ulcers, does not, I confess, appear to me by any means so obvious; and if in any instance we have introduced too much refinement into the diagno- sis of disease, it is, I apprehend, in the case before us. In affections of the internal organs, the mistaking disease of one viscus for that of another, may, in many cases, be produc- tive of the most serious evils ; but in the case of external ul- cers, cognizable by the sight and by the touch, seated upon the same parts of the body, occupying the same structure, originating in the same way, and so much alike that they are liable to be confounded one with another, even by a cautious observer, I will venture to assert, that the same or similar re- medies are likely to prove beneficial, and that, for all practi-. cal purposes, the necessity of a very minute diagnosis is done away. “ As the characteristic of the Hunterian chancre, ‘ the cir- cumscribed hardness of the edge and base,’ is admitted to vary in degree, and as this hardness may be shaded down until it becomes nearly uiulistinguishable, 1 think it advisable not to confine ourselves too rigidly to this definition in deciding upon the mode of treatment; particularly if we arc to exclude from the beneficial operation of mercury all ulcerations of the genitals which do not possess the Hunterian characters of chancre : for my experience convinces me that the cure of many of these ulcerations will be expedited by mercury,when a circumscribed hardness of the edge and base does not exist in any re- markable degree.” As to the local treatment of Ulcerations of (he genitals, this will of course depend much on the characters they exhibit. In many cases they have been treated most successfully by

252 MILITARY SURGERY. tion by a very extraordinary coincidence ; for while reading a newspaper report of it in the mess-room at Nottingham, where I was then quartered with the 33d regiment, I was called to the assistance of a soldier who had accidentally wounded his radial artery in whetting his razor; and having the fear of tight bandages fully before my eyes, I of course proceeded to secure the wounded vessel with ligatures.'â€™ In a paper by my colleague, Professor Turner, which is to be found in the Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical So- ciety of Edinburgh, there are some very interesting observa- tions on the sudden spontaneous obstruction of the canals of the larger arteries of the body, and on the process employed by nature to prevent or arrest haemorrhage from lacerated ar- teries. But without entering farther into the rationale of this process at present, I would advert to the artificial means which have, at different times, been employed for the suppression of haemorrhage ; these are compression, styptics, the actual cau- tery, the torsion, and ligature of arteries. Compressioji is a means of restraining hemorrhage, the success of which must greatly depend upon the possibility of effectually accomplishing it, and this again upon the parti- cular situation of the wound. When a subjacent bone affords a point of resistance, against which we may compress a bleeding vessel, almost any hemorrhage, however profuse, may be restrained in this way ; but here it must often hap- pen, that the degree of pressure necessary to prevent the effusion of blood, if continued for any considerable time, and applied over the surrounding parts, has a tendency to excite violent reaction, and to endanger the destruction of the part by gangrene. As an immediate application to the bleeding surfaces of wounds, with the view of applying superincumbent pressure, agaric, sponge, or charpie are the articles chiefly em- ployed ; the former was introduced by a French practitioner, Mons. Brossard, surgeon at Chatre, in Berry. Several members

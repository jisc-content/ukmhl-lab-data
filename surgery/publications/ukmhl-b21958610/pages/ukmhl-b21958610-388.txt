MILITARY SURGERY. 308 think that nothing has been omitted which was calculated to promote it, and that nothing has been done which could possi- bly impede it. It would ill become me to underrate the importance of the discussion about fractures of the neck of the thigh-bone, con- sidering the distinguished surgeons who have taken part in it; but while several points connected with this controversy are still undecided* I must, pendente lite, be permitted to solicit attention to a division of fractures of the upper part of the thigh-bone capable of immediate practical application. I would divide these fractures into such as occur in that part of the bone above the muscular insertions, and such as occur at or below the point at which these muscular insertions com- mence ; that is, into fractures above the trochanters; frac- tures passing through these processes ; and fractures imme- diately below them ; of each of which there are numerous va- rieties. In the first case, it is obvious that we have no command over the head and neck of the bone, except through the me- dium of its ligamentous connexions with the pelvis, and every contrivance calculated to insure the successful treatment ol this accident must have in view the fixture of the pelvis as well as of the thigh bone. The limb may be placed either in the bent or extended posture ; but the former I consider the best wherever we have an apparatus sufficiently perfect for keeping the parts in apposition. In the second case, that of fracture through the trochan- ters, we have both portions of the bone- acted upon, and some- times rotated in opposite directions by the muscles implanted into them ; and hence we are enabled to explain the fracture of this part of the bone with inversion of the toes ; an occur- rence which was long ago noticed by Pare and Petit, but of which the true explanation has only recently been given by Mr. Guthrie of London, and Mr. Syme of this city, each of

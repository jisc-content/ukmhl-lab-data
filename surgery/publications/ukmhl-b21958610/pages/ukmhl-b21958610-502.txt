MILITARY SURGERY. 4b2 the vessels of the former. Yet, in the most obstinate instances, I doubt the propriety of continuing a full mercurial action longer than two months. This period is more than suHieient to supersede the syphilitic action, if the course is managed with judgment. 1 have always found it unnecessary to per- severe in the use of mercury until the tumour of the bone is entirely removed. And there can be no doubt, that if the node remains after a judicious course, we should regard it merely as a simple enlargement of the bone, deriving no character whatever from its syphilitic origin.” Having now enumerated in succession the more charac- teristic symptoms of the venereal disease, both primary and secondary, and having endeavoured to point out concisely what appears to me the most eligible treatment, I would re- capitulate the leading points of that treatment. In primary venereal ulcers, when of a very recent date, and of a limited extent, my practice has lately been to destroy them imme- diately with caustic, by which I have frequently succeed- ed in superseding the necessity of any farther treatment. When these sores are more extensive, and of longer standing, when they offer nothing characteristic in their appearance, but present a clean and indolent surface, 1 adopt the same local application, and consider it in some measure a matter of option whether the patient shall or shall not take mercury ; I warn him, however, that in the event of his adopting the latter mode of cure, although the primary sores may be healed without much loss of time, he runs a greater risk of a subse- quent eruption, or other constitutional symptoms. Where ulcers again present a foul surface, with induration of the edge and base, approaching to Mr. Hunter’s description of chancre, I consider it my duty to urge the patient to submit to a mercurial course as a means of promoting the cure of the primary sore, and of guarding his constitution from a secondary affection.

TETANUS. •287 tisccl in a very early stage of the disease, there is some reason to think that amputation might not unfrequently succeed in arresting its progress. In those cases where it has been adopt- ed, it has naturally been resorted to with reluctance, as a desperate remedy, when the disease has been allowed to gain head by the lapse of time consumed in the fruitless ex- hibition of internal remedies ; and w'hen, indeed, the veiy ex- hibition of these remedies,—the continued use of large opiates, of wine, and of porter,—has perhaps brought the system into a state little likely to benefit by the operation. In short, my own experience of the effect of amputation in tetanus arising from lacerated or punctured wounds, is not sufficient to enable me to speak with confidence of its effect; nor, in scrutinizing the writings of practical surgeons, have I seen any thing to convince me, that this operation has yet had a sufficient trial in that very early stage of the disease in w'hich alone I should expect it to be successful. The diminished number of tetanic- cases which have occurred amongst the wounded, since the practice of immediate amputation became generally establish- ed throughout the army and navy, is, I think, a strong argu- ment in favour of a farther trial of this remedy in the early and acute form of the disease. A partial success has induced Baron Larrey to advise this operation in the chronic form of tetanus ; but in this state of the disease, I believe all the English surgeons, and particu- larly Sir A. Cooper, have expressed their disapprobation of it. The uncertain efficacy of so severe a remedy, and the occa- sional possibility of curing this form of the disease by milder means, will for ever prove insuperable objections to this practice. The following statement of staff-surgeon Bontflovrer, with re- ference to the state of the wounded under his care after the bat- tle of Toulouse, gives too true a picture of the treatment and general result of cases of traumatic tetanus. “ Five cases of tetanus occurred ; in one, the cold bath was the principal reme-

222 MILITARY SURGERY. entering upon the consideration of this subject, it is neces- sary to divest ourselves of much of the unsound doctrine and injurious practice of the earlier writers on gunshot wounds: it is necessary to lay aside opinions long prevalent as to the mysterious nature of wounds inflicted by musket balls, and the sovereign virtues of this or of that nostrum in their cure. We must permit the sound sense, the extended experi- ence, and the matured judgment of our modern army sur- geons, to overbalance the fanciful opinions and complicated practices to which the older surgeons resorted, at a time when the general principles of our art were less firmly established, and when the novelty of gunshot wounds induced them to seek their cure in applications equally novel. The various missiles employed by the ancients, and the powerful mechanical contrivances by which they were propel- led, it is now unnecessary to consider, the Catapult®, Balista?, and other warlike engines, having been entirely supersed- ed by the use of gunpowder, cannon, and musketry. As a matter of historical curiosity, I may however be permitted to remark, that the powders of these ancient pieces of artillery would seem, from the accounts handed down to us, to have been but little inferior to our modern instruments of destruc- tion. Atheneus speaks of a Catapulta which threw an arrow to the distance of half a mile, and we are told of others which could throw javelins from one side of the Danube to the other. Josephus has related some examples of the power of these machines. He speaks of Balist® which beat down the battlements and corners of towers, and overthrew7 many files of soldiers : they were also employed to throw great beams of wrood, lances tw’dve feet long, and stones of not less than three hundred and sixty pounds weight. Even after the invention and general employment of cannon, we find that stones, if not the only, constituted at least a prin- cipal part of the missiles projected by these engines. In

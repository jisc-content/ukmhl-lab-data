On the passage a most fatal typhoid fever broke out, which spread far and wide amongst the nurses and medical attendants of the hospitals in England when they were landed, although it was highly improbable, not to say impossible, that a particle of fomites or the matter of contagion could exist among them at the moment of their embarkation.

This author’s observations are particularly calculat-

MILITARY SURGERY. 251 alcohol ; solutions of the sulphates of iron, copper, and alum ; the diluted mineral acids; and the sulphate of copper in a solid form, or what was termed the vitriol button, con- sisting of a portion of this salt wrapped up in a piece of cloth ; in our own day, those of most note are “ Ruspini’s Styptic,” and the ct Liquide Haemostatique ” of MM. Hal- mick and Talmagrand, the merits of which will not, I think, he estimated very highly after the perusal of Mr. Hawkin’s paper on this subject, in the last volume of the Medico-Chi- rurgical Transactions of London. All these applications acting upon the principle of constringing the mouths of the bleeding vessels, or promoting the coagulation of the blood, are only applicable to superficial wounds, and here they are very generally unnecessary ; “ they are more advantageously applied in secondary haemorrhages, which arise from gangrene or ulceration, than in those which occur in fresh wounds, which it is generally an object to heal by the first inten- tion —an object which will be more or less frustrated in all cases where it may be thought necessary to have recourse to astringent applications. The Actual cautery was a means of suppressing haemor- rhage, extensively used by the ancient surgeons; but the dif- ficulty of regulating the heat, so as, on the one hand, to produce an effectual suppression of the haemorrhage, and on the other to obviate the too speedy separation of the eschar— a natural consequence of employing the iron too hot—were found to be powerful objections to the use of this remedy, even when it was most prevalent. As a means of suppressing haemorrhage from recent wounds, it is now laid aside, its use being chiefly confined to cases of haemorrhage within the mouth, and to the suppression of those bloody oosings, which some- times takes place from bony surfaces, particularly in cases where exostoses have been removed.

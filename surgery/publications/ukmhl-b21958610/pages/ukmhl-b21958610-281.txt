ANEURISM. 261 stages, it must always possess ; but in proportion as the tu- i mour increases in bulk, and the surrounding parts become in- ’ volved, this pulsation often becomes obscure, and sometimes it j i is altogether lost. Previously to the discovery of the circulation, ; and the minute investigations of morbid structure, which dis- ttinguish the recent annals of our profession, the pathology of aneurism was very imperfectly understood, and the practice j proportionally inefficient. In recent times, again, the consi- deration of this subject has perhaps been' rather obscured than elucidated by refined and exclusive views as to the structure of aneurismal tumours, by dwelling upon shades of difference not distinguishable during life, and of no moment in practice, and by the introduction of terms which, from being variously used by different writers, have led to discrepancies of opinion more apparent than real. It will, I think, afford a view of this subject sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all the principal varieties, and at the same time sufficiently minute for every practical purpose, if we look upon all aneurismal tumours as formed in one or other ' of the following ways either by a preternatural dilatation of the coats of an artery,—by a breach in one or all of these coats proceeding from within outwards,—or by a wound penetrating the coats from without inwards, and giving room for the im- mediate escape of blood into the contiguous cellular mem- brane. 1 he Hist comprehends partial dilatations, which have occa- sionally been observed in some of the larger arteries, and also that singular form of disease to which I wish to see the term varicose aneurism restricted, in contradistinction to aneu- rismal varix. That morbid dilatations in the course of the large arterial trunks, without any obvious change of struc- tuic in their coats, do occasionally occur, is admitted by all writers on this subject; and while some authors give the name ol aneurism to such dilatation, others contend, that alien-

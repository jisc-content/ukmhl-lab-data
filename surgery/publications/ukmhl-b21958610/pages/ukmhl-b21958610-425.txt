405 AMPUTATION. parative advantages of immediate and delayed amputation, tliis writer being a decided advocate for the former. Our countryman, Ranby, sergeant-surgeon to King George II. although he does not enter minutely into an enumeration of those cases in which amputation may be required, is decidedly an advocate for the immediate performance of this operation when it is absolutely necessary. In consequence of the con- flicting opinions which existed amongst the French surgeons on this point, and in consequence also of repeated failures in cases of amputation from its being performed in unfavourable circumstances, or at improper periods, the Royal Academy of Surgery was induced, in 1750, to offer the following question as the subject ol their prize essay .—“ Amputation being ab- solutely necessary in wounds complicated with fractured bones, and particularly those from gunshot, to determine the cases where it is necessary to operate on the field, and those where it may be delayed.” Of the memoirs submitted to the Aca- demy in reply to this important question, those distinguished by the approbation of this body were the memoirs of Le Cotne, and Faure, to the latter of which the prize was assign- ed, not so much from any superiority of the memoir, but from the circumstance of its being supported by a few cases in fa- vour of the advantages of delayed amputation, which both writers advocate, in all cases where it«s immediate performance is not considered absolutely indispensable. Of cases, however, requiring immediate amputation, Faure has given a most distinct enumeration, which has been very little altered in the writings of subsequent au- thors. It is therefore unfair, as has sometimes been done, to represent this writer as opposed to amputation in almost all the injuries of the extremities. After recounting several eases in which be considers the operation justifiable, be ob- serves, “ in all these six cases I say that the prompt removal of the part injured is the only remedy which surgery acknow-

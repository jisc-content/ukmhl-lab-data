MILITARY SURGERY. .100 by long experience, and there is no remedy more appropriate to wounds of this kind, nor of the efficacy of w hich we have better evidence. The eminent Prussian surgeon Schmucker, perhaps the most experienced surgeon who ever w rote on gunshot wounds of the head, places his chief dependance on Cold Lotions, occasion- ally combined with bleeding and stimulant clysters; and the following interesting statement by the late Mr. Rose of the Coldstream Guards, in reference to this point, is highly satis- factory :—“ In the battle of Talavera de la Reyna, which was fought on the 27th and 28th of July 1809, the brigade of guards lost about 600 men in killed and wounded. Amongst the latter were a considerable number of cases of wounds in the head. There were a great many cases of fracture of the bones of the cranium with and without depression, and from the cause which produced them, these were, of course, in every instance complicated with wounds of the scalp. “ On the 3d of August, in consequence of some military movements, the town of Talavera, in which the hospital had been formed, became exposed, and an order was given for all the wounded who could march, to leave it. This was so speedily obeyed that no time was afforded to make any selec- tion. The worst cases necessarily remained, but among those who undertook the march there were twelve or fourteen with wounds in the head, accompanied with injuries of the bone, at least four or five of whom had both tables of the skull fractured, and two of them, along with fracture of the os fron- tis, had each the globe of one eye totally destroyed. In none of them had the trephine been applied, nor had any attempt been made to remove splinters of bone. After leaving Tala- vera, they were exposed to a burning sun, and to very severe latigue. Every evening, after the day’s march, Mr. Rose col- lected the wounded round him, examined and washed their wounds, dressing with care those that particularly required it.

210 MILITARY SURGERY. sity.‚Äù In cases where much time is likely to be occupied in dressing a wound, it is an object worthy of attention to study in what position the patient may be most advan- tageously placed, in which every necessary examination of the wound may be most easily effected, and in which the old dressings may be removed, and the new ones applied with the least pain to the patient, and the least inconvenience to the surgeon. As a preliminary step to the removal of the dress- ings, it is often necessary to soften them by the repeated, or continued application of warm water; and this becomes particularly necessary, when, in consequence of the discharge of blood, or other matter from the wound, the dressings are stiffened and glued together, or adherent to the subjacent skin, so as, if abruptly removed, to occasion unnecessary pain, and to endanger the premature removal of the ligatures. The propriety of raising both extremities of the adhesive strap at once, and pulling towards the centre, so that the part covering the line of the wound may be the part last dis- engaged, is admitted by all who have bestowed attention upon this subject. By a contrary procedure, or by raising the strap successively from one end to the other, we should inevitably disturb the process of reunion, and lacerate the tender adhesions already formed. With a view to obviate this as much as possible, it should also be a rule, in dress- ing wounds of large extent, that no more than one, or at most two, of the stripes of adhesive plaster should be off the wound at the same time ; the new ones being applied in succession as the old are removed. In dressing wounds, we should make a point of having every thing in readiness, so that no delay may occur, by which the wound may be unne- cessarily exposed. The patient should be as soon as possible restored to that state of tranquillity and repose, which are so conducive, indeed so necessary, to his cure.

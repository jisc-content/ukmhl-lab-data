249 WOUNDS OF THE ARTERIES. mark, that the foregoing observations, obviously lead to the rule inculcated by all practical writers, of securing both ends of a divided artery. Whenever this is practicable, it ought on no account to be omitted, but there are cases of dangerous haemorrhage from stumps, from ulcerating or sloughing sores on the limbs, or from deep-seated arteries, in the hands and feet, where a ligature cannot be placed, or will not hold upon the extremities of the bleeding vessel, and where the propriety of securing the artery in the upper part of the limb becomes a question. Of this troublesome and dangerous haemorrhage, examples are not uncommon in wounds of the lower part of the radial artery, where it dips between the metacarpal bone of the thumb and forefinger; in two such cases I have suc- cessfully had recourse to the ligature of the humeral artery; and I have known the same operation twice executed with success by others. This is a practice which some will think more honoured in the breach than the observance; and it has, I know, been said, that there is no haemorrhage from vessels in the hand or foot, which may not be restrained by pressure. This I believe to be true ; but, on the other hand, I believe it to be equally true, that in certain states of a wound or ulcer, the healing process will not go on, nor the closure of the ves- sel take place, under that degree of pressure which is necessary to suppress the bleeding; and it is by checking the flux of blood to the part, without irritating or inflaming the wound itself, that I believe the ligature of the artery above to operate favourably in such cases. Besides the difference which has already been remarked in the facility and rapidity with which the superior and inferior extremities of a divided artery are closed, it would appear that there are particular arteries in which the process of closure is slower and less perfect than in others ; in other words, there are some arteries peculiarly liable to secondary haemorrhage. 1 he following observations on this point are extracted from a

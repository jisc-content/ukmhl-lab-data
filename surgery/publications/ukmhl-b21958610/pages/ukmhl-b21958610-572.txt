MILITARY SURGERY. 552 was the disease which of all others produced the greatest mor- tality. A table of all the diseases which terminated fatally in the Peninsular army during the above period, exclusive of the wounded, gives the following results : In the year 1812, 2340 men perished from this disease; in 1813, 1629; and during the first seven months of 1814, 748; in all, 4717. What may be the comparative frequency and fatality of this disease in our West India islands, I am unable to say ; but, from a table published in my work on the diseases of the Eu- ropean troops in India, it appears, that, at the principal sta- tions of the Madras army, the deaths from dysentery during the year 1817» when that table was made out, were 515, more than double the number of deaths from fever, the next most fatal disease. To an account of the phenomena and treatment of this dis- ease, as it has occurred under my own observation in various parts of India, I must necessarily confine myself, premising the following remarks of Sir James M‘Grigor on the treat- ment of the dysentery in the Peninsular army : “ The prac- tice,'” says he, “ of Dr. Buchan, Dr. Fergusson, Dr. Somers, Dr. Erly, Dr. Vetch, Drs. C. and James Forbes, Dr. Walk- er, (I may add the lamented names of the late Drs. Gray and Cabell, and indeed of most practitioners,) was to attack the disease vigorously by depletion on its earliest commencement. I myself,'” says Sir James, £< had seen much of the benefit of this practice in and about Portsmouth, in the years 1810 and 1811, with many dysenteric cases received 'from the Penin- sula. The plan of Dr. Somers appeared so judicious, and proved so successful on the first attacks of the pure unmixed disease, that I recommended its being generally followed in the army.’’ The particular details of this practice have been published by Dr. Somers himself; and, referring to his tract for the most successful mode of treatment in the form of the disease which

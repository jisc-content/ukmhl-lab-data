MILITARY SURGERY. 112 of the local phenomena of inflammation, and are more or less obviously connected with an increased determination of blood to the inflamed part. In severe cases of inflammation the constitution becomes so far involved, that we have all the usual symptoms of fever accompanying the local affection, and this symptomatic fever is liable to assume every possible shape, from that which has been peculiarly denominated inflammatory, with strong vascular action, down through every variety of shade to the lowest, form of typhus ; it follows also the usual laws of periodical increase and abatement, sometimes nearly continued, at others remittent, or intermittent. We have this fever not unfrequently assuming the bilious character, particularly when connected with the form of inflammation termed erysipelatous, and it sometimes', even in this country, assumes all the characteristics of yellow fever. Upon this point I have expressed myself to the following effect in one of my clinical lectures, addressed some years ago to the students of surgery in the Royal Infirmary, and printed for their use. ££ One symptom appeared early in this patient’s case, j which I did not fail to remark to my colleagues, and which, as far as my observation goes, is a circumstance almost , uniformly foreboding a fatal termination; I allude to a pecu- liar yellow hue of the skin, which not unfrequently attends- the symptomatic fever supervening upon wounds and opera- tions. This has perhaps struck me more forcibly from being familiar with a similar appearance in the idiopathic fevers of tropical climates; and although I have no wish to alarm the citizens of Edinburgh by talking of a yellow fever in this part of the world, yet I am bound to state for your instruction, that I have occasionally seen it here as well marked as I ever saw it at Seringapatam or Batavia, and when supervening upon injuries, much more uniformly fatal.” “ A case of this kind occurred some years ago, which made a , deep impression on my mind, and which must have done so, •

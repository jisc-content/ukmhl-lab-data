WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. 343 on the inferior animals, it promises to be highly successful; but as we cannot always calculate upon equally favourable re- sults in the human subject, I am desirous of seeing this kind of suture tried in accidental wounds of the intestine in man, and have therefore been induced to describe the operation par- ticularly. Apertures in the intestine, whether the consequence of wounds or of sloughing in cases of hernia, are extremely apt to become fistulous, and to give vent to the contents of the bowel, through what is termed an artificial anus. The dan- ger of these apertures diminishes nearly in proportion as their distance from the pyloric extremity of the stomach increases, and lhave seen several of them ultimately close without any sur- gical treatment whatever ; others have seemed to derive benefit from being touched occasionally with lunar caustic, or with the actual cautery. The ingenious proposal of Dupuytren, for the treatment of artificial anus, is fully detailed in his me- moir on this subject, and is best explained by shewing his con- trivance for restoring the continuity of the intestinal canal; but as my own experience does not enable me to speak of the merits of this proposal, it seems unnecessary to dwell upon it here. Wounds inflicted on the upper part of the Bladder, passing through that portion of it which is covered by the peritoneum, and giving place to the escape of urine into the cavity of the abdomen, are, I apprehend, inevitably fatal, at least I know of no instance of recovery from such a wound ; and Baron Larrey states that, although he has had occasion to give his assistance to many soldiers wounded in this way, they have all died within forty-eight hours. Bayonet and musket wounds in the lower part of the bladder, although complicated with fractures of the bones of the pelvis, with severe injury to the soft parts, and even with wounds of the intestines, are by no means necessarily nor immediately fatal. I have known a patient survive a wound with all these complications for four-

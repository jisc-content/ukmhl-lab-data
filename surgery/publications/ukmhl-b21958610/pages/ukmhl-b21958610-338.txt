MILITARY .SURGERY. 318 and most immediate dangers resulting from wounds of the chest When the hemorrhage arises from the lungs themselves, wc have no efficient means of commanding it, and can only obviate it by general depletion, and thus diminishing the quantity of blood passing through the lungs;—by substituting, in short, an open haemorrhage from one of the brachial veins, for a con- cealed one within the thorax. And this being the only arti- ficial means to which we can trust, it must be boldly pushed to the utmost limit. Of the extent to which this depletion may be carried with safety and with success, we have some very remarkable cases on record ; besides those mentioned by Le Dran and Schmucker, in the first of which the patient was bled fifteen times, and in the other he was bled four times a-day for eight days successively. In the report on the military hospitals in Belgium, by my predecessor Dr. Thomson, a case is mentioned in which 250 ounces of blood were drawn oft’ by the lancet in eighteen days, exclusive of the quantity abstract- ed by leeches ;—in this case repeated haemorrhages of arterial blood took place by the mouth, which were checked by re- peated venesection. In such cases we should bear in mind the following remarks of Mr. John Bell, who inculcates in his usual energetic manner the practice which every sensible writer on this subject has taught, which every experienced practi- tioner has adopted, and to which alone we can attribute the favourable issue of many formidable cases. “ One thing is very clear, that if you bleed only when the cough and bleed- ing from the lungs return, you never can do wrong; for this is the plain matter : The patient lying struggling be- fore you, is to lose a given quantity of blood ; if it be al- lowed to flow out into the lungs, he may be suffocated; if you draw it from the arm, this suffocation is prevented; if you keep him low enough by bleeding, there will be no blood to spare for this extravasation into the lungs ; if you bleed only when the bloody extravasation returns, you are taking no

54 MILITARY SURGERY. all inhabited buildings, but especially in those where numbers are collected, is so perfectly well known, that it would be su- perfluous to enter upon it here, were it not to advert to some errors in the common practice upon the subject, and to point out the means of obviating them. To ensure a due and re- gulated supply of air requires some address, for ignorance is as frequently conspicuous in its introduction as in its ex- clusion ; and when left at the discretion of capricious, un- thinking, or uncontrolled individuals, bad consequences often ensue. The class of society from which soldiers and their wives are taken have an incorrigible aversion to the free circulation of air, a circulation which is rendered more necessary for them than for the higher ranks, in consequence of their less minute attention to personal cleanliness. The essential part of the mode of ventilation which I would recommend, is to convert the passages, lobbies, and staircases of a barrack or public building into spacious air-trunks, or re- servoirs, communicating directly with the external atmos- phere, and supplying the rooms adjoining them on either side, both by means of the doors opening into such pas- sages, and by means of additional apertures made for the spe- cial purpose of ventilation. Thus at either extremity of the passages, there should be a window reaching from the ceiling to the floor of each story, the upper part capable of letting down, and the lower of lifting up, so contrived, however, as not to shut perfectly close at either top or bottom, but to leave a slit or aperture at least two inches wide, forming at all times a direct communication with the external atmosphere ; and in fine weather these passage-windows may remain open to any extent, giving the most unlimited access to the external air. In the floor of each passage one or more apertures should be made of at least two feet square, covered with strong iron gratings, and in the roof a properly sheltered aperture or penthouse, so as to admit the escape of the air outwards,

With a view to obviate suppuration, and to promote the resolution of inflammation, blood-letting, both general and topical, is our chief resource ; but, in addition to this, mercury has been long held to possess a specific influence in resolving inflammatory affections of the liver, and to its efficacy in such cases I can bear personal testimony. I am at the same time persuaded, that, from the high repute which this medicine enjoys, it has in some instances, par- ticularly of the acute disease, been too exclusively trusted to. Practitioners seem now, however, to be generally aware, that, in patients of peculiarly robust constitutions and san- guineous habits, full mercurial action cannot be induced un- til the tone of the system is lowered by bleeding and other evacuations. It therefore behoves us to remember, that, while bleeding in the acute hepatitis cannot be too promptly resorted to, the exhibition of mercury may perhaps be deferred, without any ultimate disadvantage. It was common, in my time in India, to look upon blood-letting as an evacuation which it was upon all occasions desirable to avoid, but this was a sen- timent in which I never permitted myself to indulge; and in the regiment in which I had the honour to serve, an opposite practice was gradually established, both in fever and in hepatitis, where something peculiar in the patientâ€™s habit or circumstances did not forbid it.

Under the apprehension of such a re- sult, I have employed blood-letting to a larger extent than

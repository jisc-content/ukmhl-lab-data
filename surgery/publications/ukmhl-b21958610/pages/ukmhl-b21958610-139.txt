119 INFLAMMATION. post'd, and of these none has more generally or more deserved- ly attracted attention than that in which inflammations are arranged according to the elementary tissues in which they occur. Of inflammation, as affecting different textures, we may remark, that while the inflammatory affections of the skin have all something in common, which has been characterised by the term erysipelatous, there is no texture in the system in which we see such an endless variety of diseases bearing, in a greater or less degree, the common characters of inflamma- tion, redness, heat, pain, and swelling. Erysipelas, or inflammation of the skin, presents consider- able variety in appearance and intensity, but there are two forms of it which more particularly demand attention; in the one, the disease is confined to the exterior surface of the skin, is of a superficial, transitory and erratic form, often declining in one place, and attacking another ; in the other, the inflammation is more fixed and circumscribed; the whole substance of the skin is affected, the cuticle on its surface often elevated into vesicles, while the cellular membrane beneath becomes deeply involved, being sometimes loaded with serous effusion, forming what is termed (Ede- matous Erysipelas, at other times becoming the scat of ex- tensive purulent depositions and sloughs, constituting the Phlegmonoid Erysipelas; in both forms of the disease, the erratic and the phlegmonoid, the fever preceding or accom- panying the attack is very much of the kind termed by the French, gastro-enteritic, attended with great irritability of the stomach and alimentary canal; at its commencement, it is often of a very acute and inflammatory nature, but is ex- tremely apt to degenerate into typhus. From the extensive prevalence of erysipelas in hospitals, it has sometimes been looked upon as of a contagious nature; it is, at any rate, ob- viously epidemic in particular seasons, and at particular pe- riods of the year, and is liable to supervene upon wounds and

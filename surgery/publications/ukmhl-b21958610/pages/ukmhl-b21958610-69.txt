49 ACCOMMODATION OF TROOPS. 1 India, where the army encamps at the end of every day’s march, and often changes its situation daily for months in ■succession, positions are occasionally taken up which would be ill adapted to the stationary camps sometimes formed in this country, still less to an entrenched camp, or to a barrack. VWhen necessity compels an army to encamp on wet or marshy .ground, every effort should be made to render it as dry as pos- sible, by means of drains cut across the field, and round the tents ; wherever circumstances permit, an abundance of straw, Jerns, or heath should be furnished to the men, to be inter- posed between their bodies and the ground, when lying in the tents; and when a camp is inevitably situated near a standing pool or marsh, that side of the tents, marquees, or huts, which faces the marsh should be closed as much as possible, and all ithe openings, windows, and doors, should be made on the op- posite side, in order to shun the ill effects of the exhaling va- pour. The situation of a camp must sometimes be regulated by accidental circumstances, over which the opinion of a medical officer can have little control; but whenever a choice of the ground for encampment is submitted to professional ipinion, it will be proper to recommend a dry elevated situ- ation, remote from marshes, swamps, stagnant waters, and from the immediate neighbourhood of orchards, forests, or mderwood, which are calculated to retain moisture. A ;amp is most advantageously situated on a gentle declivity, in a dry soil, and in the vicinity of a running stream. In mler to ascertain the state of the ground, it may sometimes )e necessary to dig into it to some extent, for although appa- •ently dry on the surface, it may be found sufficiently wet at ;he depth ot a few feet; and if so, ought, if possible, to be changed, particularly if an encampment is to be stationary. A. camp should never be formed on ground recently occupied, aor on a field of battle where much carnage has recently oc-

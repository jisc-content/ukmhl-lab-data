BURNS, 145 treme parts of the limbs, are often unattended with any con- stitutional symptoms whatever, and where the cuticle has not been elevated sometimes disappear in a few hours. When a vesication has once occurred, the period of complete restora- tion must necessarily be protracted, in order to give time for ' the formation of a new cuticle, which, in slight cases may, by proper management, be greatly forwarded previous to the de- i tachment of the old. In burns from gunpowder, it is to be observed that, from the momentary application of the cause, the injury is often of a superficial kind unless in those cases where, from the close contact or large quantity of the powder, or from the ac- 1 CIcIentaI combustion of the patient’s clothing, the contiguous ; parts become extensively and deeply involved. In many of the injuries originating from explosions of gunpowder, •the hands and face are more particularly affected, and there the structure of the parts as well as the nature of the ;iaccident contribute to limit the number and extent of the wesications; the surface is blackened, the eyelashes, eyebrows, "whiskers, and whatever hairs may be contiguous to the affect- ed part, are singed or entirely destroyed; grains of gun- powder are found lodged in the skin, some of them par- tially and others completely buried in it: when this has taken place an indelible mark remains after the cure, not, as some have supposed, from each distinct granule of the powder remaining undecomposed and enclosed in a minute capsule, but rather, I believe, from the granules being decomposed and partially discharged or absorbed, while the :arbonaceous or colouring matter remains in the skin ; as in t lose letters or emblematic figures which we often see artifi- cially imprinted on the arms of soldiers and seamen by pricking out the figure with a needle and inserting a little gunpowder into the skin, a mode of marking deserters which s enjoined by the articles of war.

129 INFLAMMATION. mation, and restoring the vessels of the inflamed part to a healthy mode of action. These means are twofold, Constitu- tional a,nd Local; and while the treatment of slight or limited cases of inflammation may often be trusted to local applications, where\ er the inflammation is acute and its site extended particularly if any vital organ is involved, we shall find oc- casion for the most powerful constitutional remedies. Whatever view has been taken by different pathologists of the immediate nature or proximate cause of inflammation, the utility of General Blood-letting in every severe case of this af- fection has been universally admitted ; in the employment of this remedy, we must have respect to the violence of the disease, the importance and texture of the organ affected, and to the age and constitution of the patient. One of the veins at the bend of the arm is, for the sake of convenience, generally selected as the spot from which blood is abstracted, and as much experience has taught us that more good is obtained by the abstraction of a smaller quantity of blood in a short space of time, than by withdrawing a larger quantity in a more gradual manner, we are led to the practical rule of making a large orifice in the vein, or, in robust constitutions and violent attacks, to open a vein in each arm. The early em- ployment too of general bleeding is one of the most certain means of promoting its efficacy, and when we are satisfied of its necessity, we cannot be too early in having recourse to it. As to the quantity necessary to be taken away, we ought to be regulated more by the impression which the bleeding makes on the disease, or on the system at large, than by any preconceived notions as to the particular quantity, measured y pounds or ounces. The occurrence of syncope, an event much dreaded by the patient, is one which the surgeon fre- quently looks forward to as the only thing which ought to limit the extent of the bleeding ; this event suspends for a time t e process of inflammation, by rendering the system incapa-

158 MILITARY SURGERY. the scurvy declined so rapidly, that in two years it was extinct, and there are now surgeons in the navy, of long standing, who have never seen a case of it. One of the most striking proofs of the beneficial change which has taken place in this respect, is given by Sir Gilbert Blane, • who states, on the authority of Dr. Lind, that in one of the first years of the American war, six thousand and sixty-four men, mostly affected with fever and scurvy, had been sent ashore from the Channel fleet in the course of four months; that on another occasion, after a ten weeks1 cruise, two thousand five hundred men were brought into port ill of scurvy; while the fleet under Lord St. Vincent, which blockaded Brest in 1800, consisting of twenty-four ships of the line, kept the sea from the 27th of May till the 28th of September, without one of them being in port,—without the men having a single meal of fresh meat,—and without sending more then sixteen to hos- pital. The use of fresh meat and vegetables must ever be look- ed to as the great desiderata with a view to the preserva- tion of the health and vigour of ship’s crews, or of troops on ship-board. And when, from the deficiency of these, any thing of a medicinal character becomes requisite, the lime-juice is by common consent looked upon as the most desirable and efficacious remedy; this, indeed, is so much the case, that were it not for the chance that its supply in some circum- stances and situations may be found impracticable, it would be altogether superfluous to mention the various substitutes which have at times been adopted. Of these, perhaps, the most noted are the sour krout, or pickled cabbage, vine- gar, beer, molasses, onions, nopal, and the earth-bath. In mentioning the last, I do not express any confidence in its virtues, but it was a celebrated remedy in the days of Com- modore Anson, appears to have been used in later times,

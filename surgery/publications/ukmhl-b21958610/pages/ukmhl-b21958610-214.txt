MILITARY SURGERY. 191 by accident or design, been exposed to a great extent, and where it has been penetrated by balls or other missiles, almost to its centre; where large portions of this important organ have been removed, and where the patient has nevertheless survived, and has, in some instances, been enabled to resume the active duties of a soldier. In treating of injuries of the chest, cases will be noticed in which the lungs have been wounded by pointed weapons, musket balls, splinters of bone from a fractured rib or clavicle, and where the individuals have nevertheless been restored to health. There are also several cases on record, where patients have long survived wounds of the heart; and one case is well authenticated, in which a musket ball was lodged in the substance of the heart itself, whence it was cut out after the patientâ€™s death, which took place after the lapse of six years, from disease altogether unconnected with the wound. In treating of wounds of the abdomen, we shall find that this cavity has been penetrated in every direction, both by pointed weapons and musket balls, that every important viscus contained in it has been wounded without fatal effects, and that balls have been lodged in this cavity during a large portion of a long life. In discussing the subject of wounds of the extremities, we shall have occasion to advert to cases in which the most formidable lesions, both in the soft parts and in the bones have been repaired ; above all, we shall here have occasion to admire the wonderful provisions of nature in those remarkable cases, of which many are on re- cord, where limbs have been tom from , the trunk without an alarming, much less a fatal hemorrhage. Such remarkable cases induce us to circumscribe very much the list of mortal wounds. On the other hand, we sometimes see fatal consequences originate from accidents apparently trifling. A puncture almost imperceptible, received in the most remote part of an extremity, at a distance from any vital organ, will sometimes be followed by tetanus with all its horrors, and

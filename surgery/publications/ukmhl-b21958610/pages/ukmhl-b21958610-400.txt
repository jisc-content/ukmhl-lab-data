380 MILITARY SUKGKRY. straint which am attempt to cure a broken bone necessarily implies. The opening of joints, or fracturing the articular extre- mities of bones forming them, constitutes one of the most severe classes of injuries we meet with in wounds of the limbs; and there are perhaps few cases in which it is advis- able to attempt to save limbs so injured. When such an attempt is made, the extent of the wound, its proximity to large blood-vessels, the more simple or complicated structure of the joint, the comparative injury done to the bones form- ing the articulation, the constitution and habits of the in- dividual, and the accommodation to be procured for him, are all circumstances to be maturely weighed. The most essential points in the treatment of wounded joints, are to subdue excessive inflammation by local bleeding and the usual applications, to facilitate the escape of matter when it forms, and to keep the wounded joint in a state of rest. The cavities of the joints of the upper extremity, even the shoulder-joint, is not unfrequently laid open by a stroke of the sabre ; and when the constitution is sound, and circumstances otherwise favourable, the wound ought immediately to be closed, and by proper attention to the after-treatment, re- coveries occasionally take place. Injuries of this joint from musket or grape-shot are often a sufficient ground for the re- moval of the arm at its articulation with the scapula, or for the excision of the head of the humerus. The propriety of this operation, as applicable to cases of caries of the joint, occur- ring in civil life, is well illustrated in Mr. Syme’s valuable work on excision of the joints; and its utility in wounds of the shoulder joint is fully established by several cases, of which the details are to be found in the writings of Mr. Guthrie, Mr. Morel, and others. This operation has been no less successful in the French army, in the hands of Garon Larrey, who observes, “ it sometimes happens that a

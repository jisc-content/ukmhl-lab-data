MILITARY SURGERY. 244 cno.ugh to let him see where to apply his restrictives, nor shall the pain of that operation be comparable to what it would be were not the member numbed by the compress.‚Äù If a tourniquet constructed on this principle possesses any ad- vantages in military practice, it is the ease and expedition with which it can always be procured; a handkerchief, a sash, a garter, or brace, twisted by means of a drumstick, a fife, a pistol ramrod, or some such instrument, will answer every purpose to which this mode of compression is adapted ; its dis- advantages, on the other hand, are its comparative bulk and unwieldiness, the difficulty of adjusting the compression with sufficient accuracy, and above all, its requiring a continued attention to prevent the recoil of the stick, and the consequent removal of the pressure. The improvement in the construc- tion of the tourniquet, which was introduced by Petit, con- sisted in the adaptation of a pad to be placed over the course of the artery, and the tightening of the strap by means of a screw so adjusted as to separate gradually the two plates of the instrument through which the strap is passed. This forms an instrument very superior to the other in point of neatness and accuracy of application. With either of them a sufficient power may be employed to put a complete stop to the effusion of blood in all wounds and operations upon the extremities, so as to enable the surgeon to execute the different steps of an operation with safety to the patient and case to himself; but as the tourniquet is capable of putting a complete stop to the circulation of a limb, so must its application be regulated with prudence, and its employment limited in point of time. With a view of extending as far as possible the security derived from the tourniquet to those wounded in battle, it has been proposed to point out to the musicians of a regiment the course of the principal arteries, and to instruct them in the application of the tourniquet; the difficulty, however, of mak- ing the subject intelligible to uneducated men, the risk of

W ounds of the cheek which cross the course of the parotid duct, are often followed by salivary fistulas, from the opening of this canal, and it will readily be understood, that this is moic ready to happen when the wound does not penetrate through the cheek ; in fact, one of the most effectual means of obviating this occurrence, is by carrying the incision com- pletely through the check, and thus affording facility for the formation of an internal instead of an external fistula ; or the saliva may be artificially conducted into the mouth by means of a seton. Desault proposed the cure of salivary fistulaâ€™, by compressing the parotid gland of the affected side to such a degree as to destroy its function, and to stop the secretion of saliva from it. It seems to me, however, extremely question- able whether patients in general could bear the necessary pressure for this purpose, or whether it could be effectually ap- plied. The numerous operations which have of late years been undertaken for the removal of morbid growths, originating in the antrum, afford very remarkable proofs of the liberties which may be taken both with the soft parts and with the bones of the face. I have never seen, nor do I ever expect to see, such wounds inflicted by accident, as those which I have purposely inflicted and seen others inflict, for the removal of polypous tumours, originating in the cavities of the upper jaw ; and although the result of these cases, of which not less than twelve or fourteen have now fallen under my own obser- vation, is very unsatisfactory, as regards the complete eradica- tion or final cure of the disease, yet the little constitutional disturbance which has often attended these severe and pro- tracted operations, and the rapid and complete closure of the

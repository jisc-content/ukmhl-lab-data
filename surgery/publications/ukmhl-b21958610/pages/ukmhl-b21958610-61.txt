41 DIET, CLOTHING, AND EXERCISE OF TROOPS. men will not stand a comparison with those ol their forefa- thers, or of their enemies, neither of whom were drinkers ol tea ?r1 Before quitting the important subject of diet, it may be well to offer a few remarks on the intemperate use of spirits, which has at all times proved such a bane to the British ser- vice. Of the destructive effects of dram-drinking on the health of soldiers, we have a remarkable instance noticed by Dr. Rollo, who states that, in the year 17^9, the 45th regiment, then stationed in Grenada, lost within a very few weeks twenty-six men out of ninety-six sick, and of such of these as were opened, the whole were found to have ulcer- ated intestines ; and fourteen of them had abscesses in the li- ver. The circumstance was the more remarkable, as the island was at that time considered healthy ; and, upon an in- vestigation into the causes of the mortality, one was particu- larly remarkable; the common breakfast among the men was a glass of raw spirits, with a small slice of broiled salt pork, the spirits being not unfrequently repeated during the day. It is chiefly indeed upon foreign service that the ruinous consequences of excesses amongst the soldiery are conspicuous ; and perhaps there is no situation where it is seen in a more deplorable shape than in the remote quarters in India. There, as well as upon other foreign stations, it was, until lately, not only the practice but the positive duty of a soldier to drink his allowance of spirits, amounting to nearly half a pint, daily ; the habit of dram-drinking being thus engendered, the men were induced to straggle to a great distance from the camp or cantonments in search of liquor ; they obtained it of the very worst description, and when in a state of brutal intoxication from its influence, they often lay exposed to the sun, to the parching land-winds, or to the night dews, all fertile sources of disease in that climate ; and they were also not unfrequent.. ly, in such circumstances, subjected to the ridicule, insults, or

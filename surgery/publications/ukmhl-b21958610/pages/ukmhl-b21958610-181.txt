ULCERS. 161 bones bare, while the patients suffered severely from pain, rrestlessness, general debility, impaired appetite, quick pulse, ;and other marks of a hectic diathesis. A more detailed description of these ulcers, as they occurred amongst the seamen in the Naval Hospital at Madras, will be 'found in a work on the diseases of India, published in 1807, by ■'Mr. Curtis, formerly surgeon of the Medea frigate: but the malignant ulcers described by Blane and Trotter, as frequent- ly occurring in the navy, although, perhaps, in some in- stances connected with a scorbutic disposition, are more allied to the nature of hospital gangrene, than to those ulcers which prevailed amongst the men of the Royals after their arrival n India. rI hese latter were at the time very generally, and ;[ am still of opinion, very justly attributed to the preva- ence of a scorbutic diathesis in the men’s habits from a long sea-voyage; it is necessary, however, to state, that sores of a imilar description have been observed in these localities in circumstances where the usual causes of sea-scurvy did not xist. In a collection of official papers on the Medical Sta- istiesand Topography of Malacca and Prince of Wales island, irinted in 1830 by order of the government at Pinang, we lave an account by Dr. Ward of the Madras establishment, fa destructive ulcer prevalent amongst the native troops at lalacca in the years 182/—28, which appears to me to re- semble, in every respect, the ulcer which I formerly had an pportunity of seeing amongst the European troops in that uarter. And instead of attempting a more minute description 1 this ulcer from my own remote experience, I prefer giving le following from Dr. Ward, who observes, that “ these ulcers ppeared in two forms, the common and the phagedaenic, the twiner differing little from ulcers occurring at other stations i India, the latter appearing in two distinct varieties, the 'ute and chronic phagedaina. ’

Inflammation, like almost every other affection to which we are liable, exhibits great variety in its nature and intensity ; it differs indeed in almost every individual instance, from the nature of the part affected, from the age and constitution of the patient, or from the external circumstances of climate or of season ; and the symptoms, both constitutional and local, vary also in the progress of the same inflammatory at- tack. We find inflammation in some instances hurrying on rapidly to one or other of those terminations about to be described, while in other cases its progress is slow and attend- ed with comparatively little constitutional excitement, thus giving rise to a very common division of inflammations into Acute and Chronic,â€”a division, however, entirely relative, and marked chiefly in the one case by the acuteness of the pain and severity of the constitutional symptoms, and in the other by a comparative exemption from pain and absence of symp- tomatic fever. This has given rise to another division of in- flammation, into Active and Passive, the former corresponding to the acute, and the latter to the chronic. It is impossible, however, to assign any accurate limits to these different divi- sions. And although it is of much consequence, in the ap- plication of our curative means, to attend to the character of the inflammation, we find the states of active and passive in- flammation so insensibly gliding into each other, that it be- comes a difficult question in practice to ascertain the proper period for laying aside the remedies suited to the one state, and adopting those suited to the other. Every inflammatory disease has, in fact, its paroxysms of aggravation and remis- sion, which give it at one time the character of an active, and at another that of a passive inflammation. Various other classifications of inflammation have been pro- 1

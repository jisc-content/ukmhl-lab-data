WOUNDS OF THE THORAX. 321 those, an unfortunate soldier had his body wantonly blown up by some butchers to such a pitch, that he could scarcely move his limbs from the extreme tension of the skin, and his breath- ing was so much oppressed and impeded, that he was obliged to seek relief by making deep incisions with a penknife about the region of the throat. Littre’s case gives a still more ac- curate idea of the extent to which this distension in emphy- sema may be carried. Here the swelling was six inches deep about the neck, eleven inches over the thorax, nine about the abdomen, and four over all the other parts of the body, the scalp, the palms of the hands, and the soles of the feet except- ed. In Larrey’s Clinique Chirurgicale, a plate is given which will perhaps convey a better idea of the appearance of a patient affected with emphysema than any verbal description. Both the affections now described under the terms pneumo- thorax and emphysema, may be coexistent, but it is not so much the extent of the outward swelling as the accumulation of air within the thorax, compressing first the wounded lung, and subsequently the mediastium the diaphragm and the oppo- site lung, which renders these cases so urgent and alarming. In cases where the air contained within the pleura has not escaped from a wound in the lungs, but has entered by the external orifice, we have it in our power to cut off any further supply, by closing the external wound, a practice which should generally be followed in all wounds of this re- gion. I he air will then by the expansion of the lung have a tendency to escape from the cavity of the pleura, and to dif- fuse itself in the cellular membrane adjoining the wound ; a circumstance attended with no danger, and contributing great- ly to relieve the oppressed breathing, inasmuch as the air, instead of being impacted within the parietes of the thorax and pressing wholly upon the lungs, becomes diffused over an extensive surface exterior to the chest ; and from this situa- tion it may always be evacuated if necessary, by scarifications

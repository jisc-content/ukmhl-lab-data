It was frequently established in the face of an enemy, and nearly within the reach of his guns. When a regiment halted, after getting the men under cover in some building, and con- structing chimnies, the first object was to make bedsteads, getting at the same time additional mattresses of straw, rushes, &c. It was really surprising to see with what rapidity this was done ; so much were the regiments in the habit of it, that latterly I found the hospitals complete in every thing, and the men most comfortably lodged in a few days after a regi- ment had halted. In short, by making every corps constant- ly keep up an establishment for itself, we could prevent the general hospitals from being crowded ; much severe and acute disease was treated in its early and only curable stage, and no slight wounds or ailments were ever sent off’ from the regi- ments ; by which means the effective force of the army was kept up, or perhaps increased by several thousand men, and this was effected by the joint exertions of the medical officers who served in the Peninsula; the result of medical science, and their experience of soldiers, their habits, and their apti- tude to particular diseases.” “ Regimental hospitals,” says Dr. Millcngen, “ hold out advantages which will in vain be sought for in general ones. Conducted under the eye of the commanding officers of corps, they form part of the regimental economy. The surgeon can acquaint himself with every individual’s character, habits, and description, circumstances which most materially tend to assist him in the execution of his duties :—The men, indeed, assembled 'in these establishments, are bound by ties of regimental discipline and economy, which constitute the su- periority of battalion hospitals—here misconduct is more thoroughly repressed, and malingering more easily detected ;

426 MILITARY SURGERY. seen amputation at the hip-joint performed on the living body, and it appears to me scarcely susceptible of improve- ment. OPHTHALMIA. The subject of Ophthalmia is, in my estimation, one of the greatest importance to which the attention of a military sur- geon can possibly be directed ; and that I do not overrate its importance to the military profession and to the public at large,jwill appear from the following statement. In an ex- cellent publication on this disease by Dr. Vetch, formerly of the 52d regiment, he states, that in the second battalion of this regiment, consisting of about 700 men, 636 cases of oph- thalmia were admitted into the regimental hospital between August 1805 and August 1806, of which number fifty were dismissed with the loss of both eyes, and forty with that of one; and it appears from the returns of Chelsea and Kil- mainham hospitals, that on the first of December 1810, that is, in little more than five years from the appearance of the disease in the 52d regiment, the number of soldiers who were a burden on the public, from blindness occasioned by ophthalmia, was 2317- The loss of men which armies occa- sionally sustain from fever and from dysentery, a temporary privation of the services of numbers from venereal complaints, from ulcers, and from accidents, are occurrences with which military practitioners have long been familiar; but few of these have ever been such a source of regret to commanding officers, or of vexation and disappointment to surgeons, as that fonn of ophthalmia which, for the last thirty years, has in many instances rendered whole regiments for a time ineffec- tive, and has entailed an unheard of expense on the country.

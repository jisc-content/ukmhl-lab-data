34 MILITARY SURGERY are not only unequal to the fatigues of war, but their consti- tutions not being as yet firmly established, they are almost certain to suffer greatly from change of climate, and to become sickly even in the ordinary course of service.” Even in the con- tinental armies, in which the troops are employed almost ex- clusively in their native climate, similar objections have been made to young recruits, as we find from Kirckhoff and from Coche, who in his work “ De l’Operation Medicale du Re- crutement,” &c. states it “ as his deliberate opinion, that re- cruits at eighteen years of age are commonly unfit for the du- ties of the army, not only in time of war, but even during peace.” On the other hand, in services such as ours, when men are enlisted for an unlimited period, it is of importance that they should not be admitted at too advanced an age; and upon a full consideration of all the circumstances, I think we may state that the most eligible period of life for enlist- ment is from twenty to twenty-five years of age. Into the physical defects which ought to lead to the rejec- tion of recruits presented to a medical officer for examination, we can only enter very generally : they could not be easily borne in mind individually, and being specified in the printed instructions furnished to surgeons on this subject, their enu- meration here becomes less necessary. My chief object at present is to inculcate the advantages of a systematic mode of proceeding in the examination of recruits. This examination ought never to be entered upon when the recruit is intoxicat- ed, a state in which he is not unfrequeritly presented to the surgeon. He is, of course, to be stripped naked, and exa- mined generally a capite ad calcem, both in front and in rear. He is to be made to move about the room, and to extend his joints and limbs in various directions, which will give the sur- geon an opportunity of observing any glaring malformation or distortion of the bones or contractions of the joints. The surgeon is then to proceed more minutely to examine the

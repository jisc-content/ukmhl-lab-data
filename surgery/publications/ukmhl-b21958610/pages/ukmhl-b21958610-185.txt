ULCERS. 1G5 weakly, indiscriminately. Nothing occurred to create any suspicion of its being contagious, though for the sake ol cer- tainty, every precaution, such as supplying clean sponge to each patient, avoidance of contact, or crowding, and separa- tion of the bad cases from the more simple, was carefully taken.” Ulcers of a similar character were prevalent amongst the 'Madras sepoys at Ceylon during the insurrection of 1817 and 1818, as noticed in Mr Marshall’s interesting topography of the interior of that island ; and as they were frequently ob- served to succeed to leech bites, they have been very absurdly attributed to the “ poisonous leeches of Ceylon;” but the medi- cal staff serving on the island at the time saw more adequate and 'Satisfactory causes for their production, in the very reduced diet, excessive fatigue, inclement weather, and privations of every .kind to which the troops were subjected. Such ulcers also pre- vailed both amongst the European and native troops at Prome land Rangoon, and there they seem to have been consider- ed decidedly of a scorbutic nature. It appears from Mr. Welch’s account of the diseases prevalent in the 89th regi- ment, that his patients suffered greatly from privations of all kinds engendering a scorbutic diathesis ; and Mr. Pater- son of the Madras establishment, who served with the troops lately employed at Rangoon, in reply to a letter written to him at my request, states in very decided terms, that the ulcer prevalent there was of a scorbutic character, obviously attri- butable to insufficient diet, and that it was not contagious. Such ulcers as I have now been describing, for the most ; part involve a very extended surface, but the extent of ulcers is exceedingly various : it depends much upon the injury from which they originate ; and it is well known that an ulcer is not always so extensive, either in diameter or in depth, as it appears,—the thickening of its edges, and the distension of the skin, by the swelling of the part where it is seated, giving

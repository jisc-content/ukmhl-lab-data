MILITARY SURGERY. 440 very frequently been observed to come on during the night, which gives rise to the conjecture of its being caused by something having fallen into the eyes from the roof of the barrack. It has also been observed, that “ this sensation is not constant, as it comes on suddenly, and as suddenly departs, confirming to the patient the idea of something extraneous being lodged in the eye.'” Its intermittent form has been explained, by observing, that when a vessel on the globe of the eye first be- comes turgid, its projection excites in the conjunctival lining of the palpebrae an uneasy sensation, as if it moved over a par- ticle of sand or other extraneous substance, a sensation which gradually subsides as the tension of the affected vessel dimi- nishes, and as the palpebral lining becomes accustomed to the new feeling. The accession of this symptom so frequently in the evening, or early part of the night, is perhaps owing to the change from the bracing effects of the open air, to the close atmosphere of a full barrack-room, while the tempera- ture of the eye is augmented by the closing of the eyelids in the attempts to sleep, and the determination of blood towards it in some degree increased by the horizontal posture. The appearance of increased vascularity, which subsequently becomes conspicuous over the whole of the conjunctiva, is at first confined to that portion of it lining the eyelids, and, if examined in a very early stage of the disease, this part will be found to exhibit a mottled appearance, the inflam- mation affecting detached portions or patches of the mem- brane, and these patches become gradually more extensive, until the whole of the conjunctiva assumes a fleshy redness. This inflammation of the conjunctiva is attended from the first with a great degree of swelling and puffiness, which occurs more readily, and extends more rapidly in this situation from the lax and open texture of the cellular membrane, connecting the conjunctiva with the ball of the eye. This ecchymosis is often so considerable as to elevate the conjunctiva very much 6

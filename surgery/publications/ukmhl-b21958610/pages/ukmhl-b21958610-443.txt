423 AMPUTATION. « You would observe, Gentlemen, that in amputating this young woman’s thigh, instead of forming two lateral flaps, as I had hitherto been accustomed to do, I formed an anterior and posterior flap, the one from the extensors on the fore part, and the other from the flexors on the back part of the thigh. This is a mode of operating which I flrst saw prac- tised by Mr. Liston in the cases of two boys whom he operat- ed upon in the house last autumn ; and in the case of such young subjects who cannot readily be made to retain their stumps in a desirable position, but are constantly inclined to elevate the point of the stump, it appears to me to offer de- cided advantages ; in the first place, it obviates the projection of the hone between the lateral flaps, which 1 am told has sometimes occurred ; and in the next place, you will sec that the more the point of the stump is elevated, the more are the extensor muscles relaxed, so as to afford a covering for the point of the bone. Other collateral advantages attendant upon this mode of forming the flaps are pointed out in a paper of Mr. Creasers, formerly of the Bath Infirmary, in the Twenty-second volume of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal; although he indeed recommends the flap to he formed by cutting from the surface towards the bone, instead of transfixing the limb and cutting outwards. The plan of dressing stumps after the common circular amputa- tion of the thigh, so as to place the line of the cicatrix transversely instead of perpendicularly, you will find advo- cated both by Mr. Guthrie and by Mr. Copland Hutchison, the latter of whom, in the first edition of his Surgical work, gave a marginal sketch well calculated to illustrate his valu- able remarks upon this point.” Amputation at the hip-joint is an operation which can never be contemplated with any sanguine hopes of success, but which it has nevertheless frequently become the duty of military sur- geons to undertake, and from which we have several instances

AMPUTATION. 419 difications, to sonic of which the names of Morand, La Faye, Lc Dran, Larrey, Lisfranc, Broomfield, Alanson and others, have been attached, yet these may all be resolved into two modes of proceeding, either by forming a superior and in- ferior, or an anterior and posterior flap. I have myself ope- rated in both ways, but not sufficiently often to enable me to institute any fair comparison as to the best mode of proceeding ; I may however be permitted to remark, that in a very large proportion of the cases requiring amputation at the shoulder- joint, the soft parts are so lacerated as to leave us no choice, but to compel us, as in the present case, to form the flaps as circumstances will best admit. We are now well aware that the apprehension of an uncontrollable hannorrhage, which alarmed our predecessors and made them slow to adopt this operation, is altogether unfounded ; the bleeding may always be controlled by firm pressure above the clavicle, by the hands of a steady assistant; and, in fact, this compression, as my distinguished predecessor Dr. Thomson observes, has been found ‘ easier in practice than it appeared to be in speculation.’ It is necessary, however, to remark, that at the moment of cut- ting through the axillary vessels and nerves, the patient is apt to give an involuntary start, and may throw the fingers of the assistant oft’ the artery ; an accident which once happened to a gentleman assisting me in this operation, and by which I nearly lost my patient. I was for a moment completely blind- ed by the discharge of blood into my eyes from the open axil- lary artery.” The general result of amputations at the shoulder-joint, particularly of primary amputation, is highly satisfactory, and may here he stated as an encouragement to this operation. Mr. Guthrie we find performed this amputation in all four- teen times while serving with the army, and although some of his patients, from unfavourable circumstances, did not recover.

OPHTHALMIA. 441 from the posterior part of the eyeball, while, in consequence ol the firm adhesion of the membrane round the margin of the transparent cornea, the swelling is suddenly stopped at this point, and the cornea is to be seen at the bottom of a circular cup-like depression. While this effusion is going on under the conjunctiva, oedema also takes place in the substance of the palpebra;, sometimes to an enormous extent, completely shutting up the eye, and disfiguring the whole countenance ; and as the integuments swell outwards, the firm inelastic margin of the tarsi not admitting of a correspondent extension, are in some degree inverted, so that the integuments of the upper and lower eyelids come to meet over the tarsi. Of this particular appearance a representation is given in Dr. Vetch’s first work, and of many minute circumstances which I am now attempting to describe verbally, admirable representations are given in the plates attached to Dcmour s “ T. raite, des Maladies des Yeux.” During the progress of this inflammation the discharge, which at first consisted of a little mucous fluid lodged in the duplicature of the conjunctiva, progressively increases, and assumes the character of pus. When mixed with the lachrymal fluid it is sometimes pent up in large quantities within the palpebne, and gushes out in a stream when they are opened; at other times it finds an exit more readily towards the inner canthus of the eye, and continues to flow over the cheek in a quantity almost inconceivable, “amounting to some ounces in the course of the day.” The patient during this period is affected with severe lancinating pains darting through the eye, or referred to the interior of the head ; he also complains of fulness and throbbing of the temples, a symptom which, like every other connected with the disease, is often remit- tent or intermittent. While the disease is confined exclu- sively to the conjunctiva, the symptoms of pyrexia are by no means urgent, sometimes not at all perceptible, until

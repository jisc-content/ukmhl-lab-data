117 INFLAMMATION. markable either for extremes of heat or of cold, are equally productive of diseases which frequently render the soldier in- capable of those exertions required of him, or even deprive him of life. In India, we see him falling a victim to inflammation of the liver, and in the rigour of a northern winter often dis- abled by frost-bite. I may observe, in general terms, that inflammation is apt to occur, and its symptoms to run high, in proportion to the youth and vigour of the subject affected with it; and hence we see how naturally it occurs as a consequence of those injuries to which soldiers are exposed, when inflicted upon men with constitutions such as they generally possess,—men in the vigour of life,—men enjoying, for the most part, abun- dance of nutritious diet,—and men whose habits are, in some instances, rendered irritable by the use of intoxicating liquors. In speaking of constitution as modifying the nature and re- sults of inflammation, I may here notice what has been term- ed the scrofulous diathesis, a state of the system which, wherever it exists, gives a peculiar chronic character to every inflammatory disease, rendering it less painful in its attack, slower in its progress, and more difficult of cure; but upon this state of the system I do not consider this the proper place to enlarge. The instructions for the inspection of recruits direct that every individual bearing marks of scro- fula should be rejected from the service ; and with these instructions every surgeon who values his own comfort and credit will find it his best policy, as well as his bounden duty, to comply. It is, therefore, with a view of preventing the admission of such individuals into the service that I here enumerate the marks which have been considered as charac- terising the scrofulous diathesis ;—these are, a complexion remarkably fair, with florid cheeks; thickness and swelling of the upper lip and septaum nasi; the eyelids are occasionally affected with a peculiar tenderness and irritability, easily pass-

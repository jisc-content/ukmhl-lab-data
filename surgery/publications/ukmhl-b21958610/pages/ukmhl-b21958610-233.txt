PUNCTURED WOUNDS. 213 teles to their cure, was to convert them by dilatation into I‘simple incised wounds. Of all modes of dilating recent ’ wounds, the use of the knife is certainly the least 'exeep- itionable ; and it is painful to think how much mischief must I have been produced in former times by the forcible dila- itation of such wounds, through the medium of tents, canulas, and similar instruments. Were the fact established, that a , ] punctured wound, penetrating through various textures, could be converted by the dilatation of its orifice into the state of a simple incised wound, the practice would be highly commend- able. But the violence with which stabs and penetrating wounds hare often inflicted, produce injury to a depth to which we are unable to follow with safety in dilating them, in conse- quence of the neighbourhood of important organs. In fact, the limited and circumscribed nature of a wound often proves a patient’s safety ; and as the mere enlargement of the exter- nal orifice in such cases could not obviate the injury done to the deep-seated parts, the indiscriminate practice of dilating the orifices of punctured wounds was not founded in reason, and is now very generally abandoned in practice. The necessity of affording an outlet to matter was a more plausi- ble pretext for dilating wounds amongst the older sur- geons than we can possibly admit it to be now. Under the old treatment, every wound of this kind necessarily suppur- ated ; but the doctrine of adhesion being now more complete- ly established, and the mode of promoting it better under- stood, we have sometimes the satisfaction of seeing punctured wounds uniting throughout their whole extent, or at least healing without suppuration. This indeed we must admit to be but a rare occurrence in severe punctured wounds ; but still we are to proceed in the first instance, as if we wished and ex- pected that such a termination should take place. The most formidable obstacles with which we have to con- tend in cases of punctured wounds, are, as may be infer-

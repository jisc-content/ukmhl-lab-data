LUXATIONS. 393 moved in opposite directions. The dislocation was reduced by bending and extending the forearm over the knee. The fore- arm was afterwards bent to a right angle with the upper arm, and supported by a sling, a cold lotion was applied to the inflamed parts. In a few days the patient began to have a little passive motion of the joint, and on the twelfth day was dismissed cured. Since the above was written I have seen two instances of displacement of the head of the radius forwards, one of them in a recruit, where the motion of the limb was so little im- paired, and the deformity so slight, as to have escaped the notice of a most intelligent and experienced staff-surgeon. When this man was subsequently brought before a medical board, of which I was a member, he was recommended to be discharged, rather from the apprehension that lie might at some future period make a convenience of this accident, and use it as a pretence for evading his duty, than from an opinion that he was inefficient. Although one would not willingly make a remark which could give countenance to any thing like negligence in practice, yet there is no disguising this truth, that injuries of the elbow-joint, even when treated most carefully and by the most experienced surgeons, are not unfrequently followed by stiffness and im- paired motion; while on the other hand, even when careless- ly treated or altogether overlooked, we sometimes find them followed by little or no permanent injury. The dislocation of the thumb, in which the head of the metacarpal bone is found projecting towards the palm of the hand, was first particularly noticed by Mr. Hey of Leeds, and since his time has been the subject of numerous observations. In commenting upon tbc case of a patient of Dr. Hunterâ€™s, who appeared at the Royal Infirmary some years ngo, with an irreducible luxation of the thumb, I find the following remarks in one of my printed lectures :

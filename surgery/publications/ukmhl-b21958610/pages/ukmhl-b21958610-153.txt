In addition to the increased secretion from the bowels, it is of much consequence also to promote the action of the liver; and with this view mercurial purgatives are often given with great advantage. It is a common and highly useful practice to exhibit mercurials at night, and to follow them with saline purgatives in the morning. Saline purges alone, are also greatly conducive to the cure of inflammation. They should always be taken largely diluted; in small doses frequently repeated, their beneficial operation is prolonged ; and they produce in this way another good effect, which has not been sufficiently adverted to,—they excite in the patient a greater or less degree of thirst, which leading, as it should do, to the employment of diluent drinks, promotes their bene- ficial operation. • ' Diaphoretics are another important means of moderating the symptomatic fever attendant upon inflammatory com- plaints ; and from the extensive surface upon which they ope- rate, producing often a copious discharge from the whole skin, we may easily understand the beneficial effects with which they are attended. In the selection of medicines of this class, those containing opium are avoided by some practitioners, from an apprehension that this medicine will, by increasing the action of the heart and arteries, have an injurious effect upon the local disease ; and this it certainly will have, if the sudo- rific fails in producing a copious perspiration ; but when this desirable result is procured, it will more than compensate for any temporary excitement of the circulating system from the opium. Much experience in the employment of the common Dover’s powder, and of antimonial wine combined with lauda- num, has given me confidence in the use of these remedies,

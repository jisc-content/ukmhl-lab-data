In recent cases this luxation is attended with severe pain in the situation of the joint, and inability to close the mouth. If the luxation is partial, that is to say, of one side only, the symphysis vienli is turned somewhat to the opposite side ; if complete, the chin is advanced directly forward, and the teeth of the lower jaw project beyond those of the upper. This luxation is for the most part easily reduced by introducing the thumbs, guarded with a napkin or roller wrapped round them, along the course of the molares, and thus depressing one or both sides of the jaw as may be necessary. When this de- pression is effected so as to disengage the condyle from its new situation under the zygoma, the muscles tend forcibly to replace the jaw in its proper situation, and to shut the mouth violently ; an occurrence which renders it prudent for the surgeon to slip his thumbs out laterally towards the cheek as speedily as possible. Some writers have recommend- ed the introduction of a wooden lever, which being rested on the superior molares as a fulcrum, may be used to depress the lower jaw, but every mechanical expedient of this kind is for the most part unnecessary, and is liable to injure the teeth. In the thirteenth volume of the Edinburgh Medical Journal, there is an interesting detail of the case of a seaman, named Payne, in which luxation of the lower jaw was pro- duced by gagging- The commanding-officer of the ship, who had directed the punishment, was tried by a court martial, and acquitted on the ground that the practice of gagging was cus- tomary in the service, and that, in this case, there was no un- usual severity employed. In consequence of the manâ€™s vio- lence, who bit through one or more gag-sticks, and in con- sequence of his jaw having been twice dislocated by former ac- cidents, the luxation in this case became permanent, and rc-

Independently of the usual arrangements of patients ’.according to the diseases under which they labour, wherever -space will admit of it, it would be highly useful to subdivide the sick according to the divisions, brigades, or regiments to ‘■which they belong ; so that medical officers of divisions and brigades, when serving in these general hospitals, may have their respective charges concentrated as much as possible ; while by the mere juxta-position of men belonging to the same regiment, the steady soldier or non-commissioned officer who feels for the character of his corps, may have a vigilant and controlling eye over those who may be disposed to irre- gularities, idleness, or malingering. General hospitals, when well regulated, afford perhaps advantages and superior comfort to the sick soldier worn down by protracted disease, as in them he has the advice and attendance of the ablest and most ex- perienced medical officers: as schools of instruction too they are capable of being made exceedingly useful to young men joining the army—advantages to be set off against the evils and abuses with which these establishments have been charged. Let it not, however, be supposed that I mean to dissent from the opinion entertained, I believe, by every experienced medical officer, of the superiority of regimental hospitals, which afford the means of effectually treating the sick of armies, without that accumulation of disease, irregularity of conduct, and complication of accounts, which have sometimes proved so detrimental to the service. Of the advantages de- lived from regimental hospitals in the late war, some estimate may be formed from the following passage of Sir James M‘Grigor’s paper on the health of the Peninsular army. However short a time a battalion or a corps rested in one place, a regimental hospital was established ; indeed as they

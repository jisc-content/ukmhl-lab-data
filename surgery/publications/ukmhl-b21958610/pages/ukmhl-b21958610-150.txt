MILITARY SURGERY. 130 ble of carrying it on, and thus proves one of the most cer- tain of all remedies. The quantity of blood that may be taken away before syncope is induced varies exceedingly in different individuals, and even in the same individual at dif- ferent times and under different circumstances. Many deli- cate people cannot bear the sight of their own blood, but will faint even before the vein can be well opened; and as an ex- treme case, on the opposite side of the question, I may mention that of a young soldier of the 33d regiment who was at- tacked with acute Ophthalmia. Having seen the disease in its very earliest stage, and expecting that a bleeding ad deli- quium would cut short the attack, a vein was immediately opened in each of his arms by a large orifice, while the pa- tient was standing in the erect position, (a position in which it is well known that syncope most readily supervenes), and to my astonishment the young man stood in this situation until ft fly-two ounces of blood flowed from him, when he fell into the arms of the hospital sergeant who stood ready to receive him. The ophthalmia completely disappeared for a time, but having recurred next day, the same treatment was repeated ; the patient upon this occasion fainted on the abstraction of thirty ounces of blood ; the inflammation of his eyes again disappeared, and did not recur. Although such copious depletions as the above may be em- ployed without much delicacy or reserve in young and vigorous habits, it becomes us to be exceedingly guarded in the use of the lancet in elderly persons, or in cases where a long and pro- tracted confinement must necessarily be expected. In hospital practice more particularly, in cases of compound fractures, or other severe injuries, the process of restoration may be interrupt- ed or altogether suspended by too copious evacuations. The state of the pulse is generally looked to as one of the most certain means of guiding us in the employment of bleeding,â€”in regu- ating the extent of the evacuation, and in judging of the pro-

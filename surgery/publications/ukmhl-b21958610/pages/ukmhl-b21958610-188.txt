168 MILITARY SURGERY. So numerous and so various arc the circumstances, appar- ently trivial in themselves, hy which ulcers are affected, that it is in vain to attempt, upon general principles, to determine • the quantum of exercise or of rest to be recommended, whether the object be to increase action or to diminish it,—to correct the local disease, or to improve the constitution ? Exercise, as an universal remedy in all cases of ulcerated legs, has been much insisted on; but the advice is too general to be very useful; and notwithstanding the number of instances adduced to corroborate the truth of the doctrine, many exceptions must be admitted. In cases of ulcers on the lower extremi- ties, accompanied with a state of irritability, or disposition to violent and inordinate action, where the edges are inflamed, and the surface exquisitely tender and painful, covered with a thin ichorous discharge, free and unrestrained motion proves highly injurious; but the advantages of rest and a horizontal posture are obvious. The inflammation around the ulcer abates, the pain and tension subside, and well formed pus is secreted, to the great relief of the patient’s feelings. It may also be remarked here, that ulcers accompanied with a vari- cose state of the veins of the leg, are, in many instances, cured hy horizontal posture and well-applied bandages, without re- sorting to the hazardous expedient of dividing or tying the va- ricose veins. Ulcers, on the other hand, accompanied by exces- sive languor in the circulation, oedematous swellings and cold- ness of the feet, such as are usually met with in chlorotic pa- tients, in persons advanced in life, or in persons who follow a sedentary occupation, are speedily improved in their appearance hy the moderate use of exercise, with a roller applied tight from the toes to the knee. And I may add, that the healing of ulcers under a moderate share of exercise, is found to be much more permanent, and the ulcers less liable to break out again, than when cured in the horizontal posture.

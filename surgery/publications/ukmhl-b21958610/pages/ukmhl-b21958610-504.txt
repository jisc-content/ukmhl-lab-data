MILITARY SURGERY. 4ff4 profuse employment of mercury. These swellings will, how- ever, when they originate without the previous abuse of mer- cury, often be discussed under the employment of this mi- neral. When they originate in broken constitutions, and after a variety of complicated treatment, we must chiefly expect relief from an improvement of the general health under judicious regimen and wholesome air. In giving this general recommendation of mercury for the cure of venereal complaints, I am not guided solely by my own experience, which has been too generally, and for a long time too exclusively on one side of the question, to enable me to form an accurate comparison. But recollecting that for many years of my life I was in the habit of seeing at least lrom ten to twenty venereal cases daily; recollecting that these cases were almost uniformly treated with mercury; and recollecting only one instance of death from this disease, where the treatment, from first to last, fell under my own observation, I am naturally led to look upon mercury as more generally successful in the cure of syphilis than any other remedy in any other disease whatever. Let me not, however, be misunderstood; I renounce the idea of holding out mercury as a specific, for in what have been called specifics no confidence is to be placed. I have never contended, as some have done, for the absolute necessity of this medicine in the cure of the vene- real disease, and have ever held it absurd to assert that this individual medicine, so peculiar in its character, -and limited in its production, that this and this alone should be capable of curing a disease so Protean in its shapes; so widely diffused over the surface of the globe ; effecting every texture in the body ; incident to the natives of every country, and of every clime, of every colour, and of every constitution. I equally renounce the idea of recommending for the cure of the vene- real disease, those violent and long-continued salivations.

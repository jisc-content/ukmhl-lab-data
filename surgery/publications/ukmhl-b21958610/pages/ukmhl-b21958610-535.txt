515 STRICTURES. able to retain a bougie with tolerable case varies greatly in different individuals; and although in irritable constitutions this may not at first extend to more than a few minutes, yet by extending the period gradually the patient becomes able to retain it sometimes for hours without inconvenience ; and it is obvious that the longer it is retained, the more speedily shall we accomplish our purpose, for by the continued compression the activity of the nourishing vessels will soon be destroyed, and the part itself will ulcerate or be absorbed. In all cases, when we can pass a bougie even of the smallest size through the stricture, we have the cure within our power by due perseverance with the common plaster or metallic in- strument ; but in cases where the stricture is of very limited extent, or where the stricture is so irritable as to prevent the patient from retaining the instrument in contact with it for any length of time, the use of caustic will often be found preferable. Of the bougies in common use, which are made of plaster, catgut, elastic gum, or steel, the last is by far the most manage- able instrument; and although the others may occasionally be found useful, the steel instrument, particularly when the stric- ture admits a bougie of some size, is undoubtedly the safest, from the surgeon having always a command over the point of the instrument. Some ingenious contrivances have been brought forward with a view to the dilatation of strictures, but none of them, it may be observed, is admissible into very tight strictures, and whenever a stricture is of such dimen- sions as to admit \Y iesss Dilator, oranysimilar instrument, the cure is comparatively easy by a succession of common steel bougies. The position of the patient, for the introduction of a bougie, whether erect or horizontal, is in common cases a matter of in- difference ; but wherever difficulty is anticipated, the patient should be made to lie down upon a bed or couch, by which means he is enabled to put his thighs in a state of complete

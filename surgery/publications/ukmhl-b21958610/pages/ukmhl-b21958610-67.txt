Actual war was in reality a time of relaxation to the soldiers of this en- terprising people. The Romans were not only sensible of the advantages which those habits of exercise procured them in action, but had also the penetration to discover that they were eminently serviceable in the preservation of health. We learn from Vegetius that the Romans exercised their men daily in the Campus Martius when it was fair weather, and under cover when it rained or snowed, and this author adds a remark by no means flattering to the members of our profession, Rei militaris periti, plus quotidiana armorum exercitia ad sanita- tem militum putaverunt prodesse, quam medicos.

It is of consequence also that troops coming to a climate different from their own should be somewhat habituated to it before they enter on the fatigues of service.

214 MILITARY SURGERY. red from the preceding observations, the excess of inflamma- tion with which they are apt to be followed, the liability of this inflammation to extend along the contiguous textures, and to proceed till it terminates in suppuration ; thus giving rise to extensive collections of matter, which not finding a ready exit, from the contracted nature of the wound, insinuates it- self under the fascia, and in the interstices of the contiguous muscles, leading to the formation of sinuses and fistulous openings; the cure of which, every surgeon knows to be te- dious, difficult, and uncertain. So much indeed has a punc- tured wound been allied in its nature to a sinus, that some writers have represented all such wounds as exactly requiring that mode of treatment adapted to the cure of sinuses, and for this purpose they have recommended the introduction of a seton along the course of the wound ; a practice which, however ap- plicable to an old, callous, and indolent sinus, where a defect of inflammatory action is the chief obstacle to the cure, would be little fitted to allay the irritation, to mitigate the pain, and to subdue the inflammation, which in punctured wounds are so apt to baffle even the best concerted plans of cure. Although some French authors have given us accounts of their having drawn their setons across patients’ chests, in cases of stabs, they would find it very difficult, in these days, to convince us that such practices were devoid of harm, much less productive of good. The indiscriminate use of setons, like the preposterous and unmeaning dilatation of the orifices of punctured wounds, is now, happily for the comfort of the patient, and the credit of surgery, entirely laid aside ; it was, as Mr. John Bell has justly observed, only fit for that period of our art “ when every flap of skin, instead of being re- united, was cut away, when every open wound was dressed as a sore, and every deep one plugged up with a tent lest it should heal.—When M. Guerin continued for thirty days drawing a coarse seton through the breast every morning, and

Internally, Baron Larrey recommends warm emollient and antispasmodic beverages. His patients are never deprived of light nourishment, broths, jellies, eggs, soup, &c.; “ his experience having,” he says, “ taught him, that soldiers cannot bear low diet so well as persons leading an inactive life.” Notwithstanding the above observations of Baron Lar- rey, to whose extensive experience as an army surgeon every deference is due, I am greatly inclined to lean to the .practice of using *cold applications, which were recommend- ed so long ago as the days of Rhazes and Avicenna, and advocated, in later times, by Sir James Earle, who, in “ An Essay on the Means of Lessening the Effects of Fire on the Human Body,” published some thirty years ago, has recommended the use of cold water, or of ice ; the burned parts to be immersed in the cold water, or covered with cloths dipped in the same, and changed from time to time, as they acquire warmth from the part.

To show the extent to which cold applications have been

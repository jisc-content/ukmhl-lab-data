483 SYPHILIS. In short, for a long time back, I have been strongly im- pressed with the opinion, that the more speedily we can cure the primary sore, by whatever means, whether with or without mercury, the more likely we are to prevent any constitutional affection ; and it is a remarkable fact, established by the general returns from the army hospitals already referred to, that of patients treated without mercury, one-twentieth have had secondary symptoms, while of those whose primary sores were cured under the use of this mineral, only one-fifty-fifth have had secondary symptoms. When ulcers are accompanied with much inflammation, where they show any disposition to phagedama or sloughing, I consider mercury positively forbid- den, at least in the first instance, and the inflammatory symp- toms are to be met by local or constitutional antiphlogistic remedies, according to their severity. In the treatment of acute buboes, I recommend mercury more with a view to pro- tect the constitution, than from any decided influence it seems to possess on the local affection. The treatment of these is to be conducted upon the same principle as that of other glandular swellings; but I cannot help again adverting to the bene- ficial effects experienced from blisters in the indolent state of buboes. In the treatment of ulceration of the throat, possessing an indolent, and what has been considered the true venereal cha- racter, mercury will be found to operate most beneficially ; but when much "inflammation of an erysipelatous character exists around the ulcer, it is to be carefully withheld. Cutaneous eruptions for the most part yield readily to the combination of calomel and antimony, in the shape of the Plummer's pill, when in a chronic form ; in their earlier and more acute stages, they frequently require bleeding, warm bathing, and purgatives. In affections of tlie bones, perhaps more than in any other in- stance, much mischief has been done by the indiscriminate and

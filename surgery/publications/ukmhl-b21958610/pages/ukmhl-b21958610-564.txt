In these renewed paroxysms, instead of intense febrile heat and strong arterial action, the warmth of the body and the frequency and strength of the pulse are sometimes less than when the patient was in health ; but the pain and heat of the stomach become excruciating, with incessant strainings to vomit, which in most of the fatal cases are followed by hiccough and repeated dis- charges of matter resembling turbid coffee, more or less dilut- ed, and also by the evacuation of similar dark matters from the bowels.

It seldom happens in severe cases of this disease that the

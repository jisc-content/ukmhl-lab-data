333 Mâ€™OtfftDS OP THE ABDOMEN. Journal, recorded hy Mr. Doyle, surgeon of the 62d Regi- ment. Here no alarming symptoms supervened until many months after the infliction of the injury, but the patient was eventually carried off by the accession of inflammation of the intestine, which had been forced upwards, through the wound of the diaphragm, and lodged in the cavity of the thorax. The symptoms which particularly indicate wounds of the diaphragm are acute pain, great anxiety, and oppres- sion about the prajeordia, with hiccup, and risus sardoniens. The treatment which naturally suggests itself is depletion, ab- stinence, and rest. AY ounds which penetrate deeply into the substance of the Liver, are for the most part speedily fatal, nor will this surprise us when we recollect how abundantly this organ is supplied with blood. The wounded ramifications of the hepatic ar- tery, the \ena porta, and hepatic veins, are all sources of profuse haemorrhage, a haemorrhage which we have no me- chanical means of effectually suppressing; and whether the blood finds an exit by the external wound, or accumulates in the cavity of the abdomen, a quantity is often lost sufficient to prove destructive to the life of the patient; but from slighter wounds of the liver, recoveries are not unknown. When the patient survives so long as to admit of an adhesion taking place between the surface of the liver and the lining contiguous to the wound, the matter which subsequently forms is precluded from access to the abdomina\ cavity, and the case is then assimilated to one of abscess of the liver, of which I have had an opportunity of seeing many. % Rnccess, however, in the treatment of these cases has not been such as to induce me to form, or to justify me in bold- ing out, any sanguine hopes of success in the management of vounds of the liver. The fixed situation of this viscus gives us considerable facility in detecting its wounds, and the symp- 7

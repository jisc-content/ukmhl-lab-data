401 MILITARY SURGERY. lapse occurs, while in a great land-battle it is often otherwise. It has also been said that the seaman generally goes into, ac- tion in a full and vigorous state of health, while the soldier is often debilitated by the privations and fatigues of a previous campaign, and that this may render the state of collapse afier wounds more frequent or more marked in the one service than in the other. But these circumstances do not afford to my mind a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty, nor do they exist to such an extent as to lead to opposite results; and although at a loss to reconcile the conflicting statements upon this point, 1 am pleased to observe that the sentiments of a surgeon arc not to be regulated by the department of the service to which he happens to belong. In the most recent work upon the subject, that of Mr. Hammick of the navy, the author distinctly admits the necessity, in some cases, of allowing “ the patient to recover a little from the shock of the accident,” previously to amputation of his limb. This I confess I am greatly pleased to see, not so much because it supports my owrn view- of the matter, as because it takes aw ay from this subject the semblance of a party question between the surgeons of the two branches of the public service, a colour- ing which some have been disposed to give to it, and which, 1 am confident, from the high professional character of the two gentlemen who have chiefly agitated this question, that they would both be very sorry to see it assume. Our celebrated surgeon Wiseman had evidently consider- ed the question of primary and secondary amputation, and he gives a decided preference to the former. It does not appear, however, that Wiseman was in the habit of performing ampu- tation except in the extreme parts of the limbs; and no instance is, I believe, recorded in his works, nor in those of his prede- cessors, of immediate amputation above the knee. In the work of Le Bran on gunshot wounds, published in 1737, we have the first, and one of the most distinct statements of the com-

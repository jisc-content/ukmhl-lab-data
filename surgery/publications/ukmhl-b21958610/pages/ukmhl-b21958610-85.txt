PROPORTION OF SICK IN ARMIES. Go ivith which an army can be supplied, the fatigue it under- goes, and its success or discomfiture by the enemy ; if we nclude the probable casualties from wounds, the calculation -s -rendered still more difficult; it may however be worth vhile to notice the following statement of the numbers of sick and wounded in the Peninsular army, from 21st De- cember 1811 to the 24th June 1816, as given in Sir J. ’M‘G rigor's paper. “ On reference to the returns of sick and wounded for the above period, it appears that three hundred and forty-six thou- sand one hundred and eight cases of disease or wounds were treated in the hospitals : of which were discharged cured two hundred and thirty-two thousand five hundred and fifty-three ; four thousand five hundred and eighty-six were invalided ; and eighteen thousand five hundred and thirteen died of their wounds or of disease ; including however every wounded man who had been received into hospital, or who had even been seen by a surgeon.” Into this statement some accidental error seems to have crept, as the numbers cured, dead, and invalided, does not correspond with the total number treated, but it gives us a view of the chances of war upon an extend- ed scale. It refers to a period of considerable duration, em- bracing very active operations, and is the most recent account wre possess of the contingencies incident to a European anny fighting on a European soil. The article Hygiene Militaire, in the Dictionnaire des Sciences Medicales, contains some observations on the pro- bable number of sick which an army is likely to furnish ; and Vaidy, the author of that article, states, that in gar- rison, in a healthy country, where provisions are abund- ant, and the barracks well constructed, we may expect about five per cent, of sick in the infantry, nnd somewhat less in the cavalry and artillery ; after a successful campaign, when an army has been victorious, he has known this number much

INFLAMMATION. 121 it seems to be a wise provision of nature, that mucous mem- branes, in the inflamed state, show no disposition to adhere, an event which, by closing up the different canals to which they afford a lining, would inevitably be attended, in many cases, with a fatal event. The serous membranes which line the three great cavities of the body, and which also afford an envelope or coat to the viscera which these cavities contain, are extremely susceptible of inflammation, the presence of which is ascertained by the severe and lancinating pain with which it is accompanied, and by the existence of symptomatic fever. In a state of inflammation these membranes are found to afford a copious effusion of serous fluid, sometimes of pus, frequently of sero- purulcnt matter, and very often of coagulable lymph ; the effusion of the latter giving rise to those adhesions which are so common a result of inflammatory attacks of the pleura or peritonEeum. The capsular ligaments of joints, the sheaths of tendons, the bursa: mucosae, in short, what are termed synovial mem- branes, are less susceptible of inflammation than the class of serous membranes ; but as the synovial membranes are liable to inflame from those external injuries to which soldiers and sailors are peculiarly liable, I mean from wounds and contu- sions of the joints, they demand much attention from the mi- litary surgeon. The constitutional symptoms are extremely difficult to control, and require the use of the most powerful antiphlogistic remedies ; in cases where the inflammation of these membranes arises spontaneously, or, at least, without any obvious cause, the constitutional symptoms are more mild in the incipient stage, but frequently, after a long continu- ance, assume the form of an irremediable hectic. Inflammation of the periosteum, of the aponeuroses of mus- cles, of tendons, and of ligaments, which, in a sound state, are endowed with little sensibility, is characterised generally by an

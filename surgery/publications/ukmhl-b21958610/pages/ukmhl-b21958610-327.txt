WOUNDS OF THE SPINE. 307 transitory concussion, liable to end, like that of the brain, in inflammatory action, and they also very frequently occa- sion paralysis of the inferior parts of the trunk and of the limbs from compression of the spinal marrow; which may, as in the head, be caused either by depression or displacement of the bone, by the accumulation of fluids within the sheath of the spinal cord, or by the intrusion and lodgment of fo- reign bodies. In those cases of injury of the spine, from cannon and musket shot, incident to soldiers and seamen, and in those accidents which happen more particularly to the latter, by falls from the rigging, the seat of the injury is for the most part conspicuous, and it will readily be un- derstood, that the symptoms vary considerably, as the in- jury is more or less distant from the occiput. In every severe injury of the spine, besides the pain and inflammatory swelling, with its usual concomitant fever, we have paralysis more or less complete of the parts which derive their nerves from the inferior portions of the spinal marrow ; if the injury be above the origin of the nerves, supplying the thoracic muscles, the respiration is impeded ; or if lower down, the respiration may go on freely, while the alvine and urinary evacuations are suspended or impeded. In all parts of the spine, diastases or subluxations are liable to occur, for the most part, followed by inflammatory action, which, in the early and acute stages, often demands blood-letting both general and local, with other antiphlogistic measures. But when the in- flammation appears in a chronic or subacute form, it is best treated by repeated local bleeding, the actual cautery, caustic and blister issues. In the region of the neck, we have occasionally luxations of the vertebra5, ending for the most part fatally. A remark- able example of complete luxation was transmitted to me some years ago, by Mr. Oldknow of Nottingham, in which the displacement took place between the fifth and sixth cervical

167 ULCERS. i 1 has but little to ilo ; indeed, the less he interferes with the I process of nature the better, any over activity on his part will i in all probability retard the cure. The following remarks must be looked upon as more pecu- 1 liarly applicable to ulcers of the inferior extremities. In this : situation they are by far the most frequent, and here, also, va- rious circumstances concur to render them difficult of cure. While no part either of the surface of the body, or of the mem- branes which line the different canals, are exempt from ulcer- ation, yet the integuments, the muscular and tendinous parts of the legs, are peculiarly the seats of this disease; and here the proximity of a large extent of the tibia to the surface, the languor of the circulation, partly by reason of its distance from the heart, and partly by reason of the dependent position of the limbs, are circumstances calculated to retard the cure. The influence of these circumstances is rendered very conspicuous by a statement of Sir Everard Home, published on the au- thority of Dr. Young, who served several years as a regimental surgeon in the West Indies. Dr. Young observed, that “in the 32d regiment there were 145 tall men, and 276 short men. That in the course of four years, 22 were discharged from those of the first description, and only 23 from the se- cond on account of ulcers of the legs;” and this singular ob- servation does not stand alone, but is quite coincident with m own experience and that of others. In the treatment of ulcers of the legs, two general and op- posite principles have been enjoined,—Exercise and Rest; and each of these has in recent times had its abettors. Is a patient with an ulcer on his leg to keep himself still and quiet ? Is rest absolutely necessary for his cure ? Or may he be allowed to walk about as usual P These are questions which constantly present themselves, and have not hitherto received, nor do they indeed admit of any definite reply.

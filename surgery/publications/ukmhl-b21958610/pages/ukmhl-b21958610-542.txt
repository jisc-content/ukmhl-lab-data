MILITARY SURGERY. 522 of large opiates. I cannot however avoid this opportunity of expressing my apprehension, that this plan of treatment is used too indiscriminately, and may sometimes be pushed to an inju- rious extent. In the cases of young subjects, when the attack was attended with much flushing of the face and tendency to phrenitis, I have repeatedly employed blood-letting, both gene- ral and local, with obvious advantage, and indeed I am at this moment attending, along with another practitioner, a patient whom I have twice seen bled under attacks of this disease. He is a young master tradesman, left by the death of his father at the head of a large establishment, and has repeatedly given himself up to fits of continued intoxication, followed by de- lirium tremens. The extent of Corporal punishment, or Flogging is now greatly restricted ; the powers of a Regimental court-martial extend only to the infliction of two hundred lashes, a circum- stance which relieves the surgeon from much irksome duty and heavy responsibility ; but as the regulations of the service still provide for the corporal punishment of offenders, they also enforce the attendance of the surgeon to see that it shall not be carried to excess. In this climate, soldiers are generally able to bear the limited number of lashes to which the sentence of regimental courts-martial has latterly been restricted, but on foreign stations, menâ€™s constitutions are sometimes brought into a state in which even a hundred lashes may prove most seriously hurtful. The formidable ulcers formerly noticed as prevalent upon some of the East India stations are liable to supervene upon punishments, and I have now before me some remarkable cases of this kind which occurred amongst soldiers who had served on the western coast of Africa. In all climates, it should be recollected, that those individuals who are most likely to render themselves amenable to corporal punishment, are very frequently the least able to bear it; and this applies equally to those whose vital powers may be temporarily impaired

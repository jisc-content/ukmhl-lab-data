For although some peculiar views have been entertained relative to the na- ture of what has been termed the granular state of the lining of the palpebras, yet I believe its treatment by escharotics as preferable to excision is fully established by continued observation. And of the length of time during which this subject has been more or less under the notice of the pro- fession, some idea may be formal from the following passage of a Report of a Committee of the House of Commons ap- pointed in 1821 to inquire into the establishment of the Ophthalmic Hospital in the Regent’s Park, and the claims of Sir William Adams upon the public. “ Your Com- mittee have to report, that the existence of these granula- tions, and the necessity of removing them, seems to have ban

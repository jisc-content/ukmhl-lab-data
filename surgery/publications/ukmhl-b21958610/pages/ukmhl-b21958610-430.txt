Upon this point I have had as good an opportunity of forming an opi- nion as most of my cotemporaries, having now served nearly thirteen years in the former, and eleven in the latter. In civil hospitals the comparative success of primary amputation has been by no means so great as that which I was accustomed to see and to hear of in the army. Sanson, who has noticed this fact, has assigned several reasons obviously leading to a difference of result, and amongst others, the moral influence of the different circumstances under which a patient is often received into a civil and into a military hospital. A trades- man, who has perhaps an indifferent constitution, and a wife and family dependent upon his exertions, is admitted with an injury requiring amputation, and which may be the result of an accident originating in intoxication, ignorance, or folly, by which he finds himself suddenly reduced to miseiy and dependence; while the soldier, again, with a constitu- tion originally sound, and accustomed to contemplate such an accident, loses his limb in a good cause, under circum- stances creditable to himself and duly appreciated by his country, from which he is certain of a pension for life.

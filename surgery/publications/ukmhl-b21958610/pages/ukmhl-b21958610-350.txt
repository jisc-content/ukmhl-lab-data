MILITARY SURGERY. 330 and of what may be termed the fixed or glandular viscera. I have already had occasion to observe that wounds of tendinous parts are frequently attended with troublesome and dangerous consequences ; and w hen we recollect the extensive tendinous expansions over the forepart of the belly, we cannot be sur- prised at seeing bayonet or other punctured wounds of this region, followed by much constitutional disturbance, extensive inflammation, and the formation of abscesses. Such inflam- mation is best obviated in its early stages by the usual anti- phlogistic measures, general and local blood-letting, low diet, gentle aperient medicines, warm bath, fomentations, or cold sedative applications, relaxation of the wounded parts, and perhaps enlargement of the puncture, a practice which is par- ticularly recommended by the Danish surgeon Callisen in su- perficial punctured wounds of the abdomen, and which is un- doubtedly more admissible and more advantageous here than in many cases in which early dilatations have been recom- mended. When suppuration occurs from wounds or contu- sions in this region, the matter does not readily point outwards, but extends under the fascia; of the abdominal muscles, and between the tendinous layers. Early incisions are therefore ad- visable whenever the existence of matter is ascertained. In wounds penetrating the parietes of the abdomen, where no lesion of any of the internal organs is indicated, and where no protrusion of the viscera takes place, the surgeonâ€™s duty is plain and obvious. In slight cases of punctured wounds, the external opening may be covered with adhesive plaster ; ten- sion and swelling will be best treated by relaxation of the wounded muscles, and the application of leeches in the im- mediate neighbourhood of the wound, while inflammation of the peritoneum and internal parts is to be obviated by general bleeding, abstinence, and rest. The means of treat- ment I have just recommended, are also applicable to in- cised wounds of a limited extent; and in addition to these,

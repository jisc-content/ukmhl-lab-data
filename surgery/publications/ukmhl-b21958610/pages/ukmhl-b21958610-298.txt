MILITARY SURGERY. 278 Java in 1811, and from a memorandum kept by Dr. Bade- nach, who was then assistant surgeon of the 59th regiment, I am enabled to state, that out of 150 Europeans wounded at the attack on Fort Cornelius near Batavia, only one tetanic case occurred ; while from the same gentleman I learn that in a small detachment which proceeded to Macassar, out of eight or ten men wounded, two died of tetanus ; and it ap- pears from an essay published in 1817 by Mr. Schaw, that he had occasion to witness a large proportion of tetanic cases amongst the wounded Europeans and sepoys employed in a successful attack upon Sambas, a piratical Malay town in the island of Borneo. In all tropical climates, wounded persons, particularly if exposed during the night, are liable to be at- tacked by tetanus ; it is said to be particularly apt to super- vene upon contused, lacerated, and punctured wounds about the fingers and toes or other tendinous parts, upon gunshot wounds in the course of the nerves, and upon injuries of the joints. Baron Larrey has observed the frequency of this disease in Egypt, where he says that “ this affection was more intense, and bore a greater resemblance to hydrophobia, than in the colder climate of Germany.” Exposure to the cold, moist, nocturnal air, he found particularly conducive to it, and that it was most prevalent in damp situations adjacent to the Nile or to the sea. In speaking of the traumatic tetanus, Baron Larrey remarks that when it originated from wounds injuring nerves on the fore part of the body, cmprostliotonos was occasioned; when the posterior nerves were hurt, opistholonos ; and that when the wound extended quite through a limb, so as to injure equally both descriptions of nerves, complete tetanus ensued. The Baron’s remarks upon this point have hitherto been so little supported by the experience of others, that I am parti- cularly desirous to turn the attention of future observers to his statements regarding the causes and comparative frequency of

WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 353 constitutes much of the surgical treatment of patients wound- ed in the trunk. The removal of extraneous bodies when easily accessible, by the finger, the probe or the forceps, is ob- viously consonant to the dictates of common sense. The re- turn of prolapsed parts, and securing them as far as pos- sible in their natural situation, are almost all that the sur- geon has to do in the way of operation. In the treatment of wounds of the three great cavities, it is of the utmost importance to keep constantly in view the func- tions of the respective organs lodged within. In addition to the general measures of depletion and abstinence applicable alike to them all, we should act upon the principle of giving the wounded viscus the least possible cause for exertion in the exercise of its peculiar function. In wounds'of the head, quietness and exemption from mental exertion should be en- joined. In wounds of the thorax, the circulating fluid should be reduced, with the view of diminishing the effort which the heart is called upon to make in circulating, and the lungs in oxygenating the blood. In wounds of the abdomen, again, the diminution of the ingesta, to the smallest possible quan- tity consistent with life, is eminently calculated to facilitate the repair of injuries of the chylopoetic viscera. WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. Many of the general observations which have already been made on wounds of the soft parts, apply particularly to wounds of the limbs, and a very brief recapitulation of these, is all that seems necessary, previously to entering upon the consid- eration of those injuries which involve the bones. 2 A

325 WOUNDS OF THE THORAX.' as happens in other parts of the body ; three cases of this kind are mentioned by Percy, and one by Boyer, in which a ball was found in the lung, which was known to have been received twenty years before. The more common consequence, however, particularly of balls lying loose in the cavity of the thorax, of which examples are also given in Percyâ€™s Man- ual, is the copious secretion of purulent matter, or empyema, a disease occurring also from inflammatory attacks in the chest without any mechanical violence. W hen the aperture made by a ball remains fistulous, it for the most part af- fords a sufficient opening for the escape of any purulent mat- ter which may be formed, although it may not afford sufficient space for the extraction of the ball. 1 or m cases of this kind, when the function of one lung has been long suspended, the intercostal spaces become diminished, the ribs become anchy- loscd, and the cavity on the affected side of the chest adapts itself to the diminished bulk of the collapsed lung. This change has been well explained by Baron Larrey, who has published in his Clinique Chirurgicalc, some figures illustra- tive of the altered shape of the thorax, in patients who have laboured under empyema. It is the diminution of the in- tercostal spaces m such cases, which renders the removal of a portion of one of the ribs necessary, as practised by the Barou in the case formerly referred to ; and I have been for years in the habit of showing upon the dead body, that such an opera- tion may be easily performed by applying the head of a trepan to the portion of rib we wish to remove. When it becomes necessary to make an opening for the re- lief of idiopathic cases of empyema, the point of election, as specified in all the systematic works in surgery, is between the fifth and sixth ribs, and midway between the spine and sternum. An opening in this situation will for the most part give sufficient facility for the escape of any fluid collected within the thorax, but in cases where a patient is greaty de-

DISEASES OF CAMPS AND GARRISONS. G3 The diseases of soldiers, while they admit of all the usual classifications and nosological arrangements into febrile, in- flammatory, and so forth, have, with reference to their pecu- liar mode of life, been divided into diseases of the Camp and of the Garrison. The former have also been characterised as the diseases of summer and of autumn, this being the season of the year for encampment; and here fever and dysentery have, from the earliest ages, been the scourge of armies; have always been a source of infinite loss to the service, and of un- ceasing labour to the medical attendants. Of the extent to which these two diseases prevailed in the Peninsular army, some conception may be formed from the following statement extracted from Sir James M‘Grigor's account of the diseases of that army. There were admitted during the years 1812-13, and part of 1814, sixty-eight thousand eight hundred and ninety-four cases of fever, of which six thousand seven hun- dred and three died, equal to 9-7 per cent. ; and during the same period there were admitted into the regimental hospi- tals seven thousand five hundred and twenty-six cases of dysentery, of which four thousand seven hundred and seventeen died, or 62.5 per cent. The diseases incident to soldiers in garrison, or quarters, have also been characterised as the diseases of winter, and of the early part of spring; they consist, in this part of the world, chiefly of inflammatory affections of the chest, rheumatic complaints, venereal diseases, and ophthalmia. The diseases prevalent amongst troops on foreign stations will be more particularly noticed in a subsequent part of the course, but in estimating the proportional sickness amongst troops at different seasons of the year, Sir John Pringle lias given a statement from his experience in Germany, in Flan- ders, and in this country, during the campaign of 1742 and the subsequent years, which may not be undeserving of at- tention. “ In the beginning of every campaign,”' says he.

WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. .‘337 gastric artery. When portions of omentum have been for some time protruded, they are occasionally found adhering to the lips of the wound, and may be removed by ligature or excision ; but whether this be done or not, the protruded part will ultimately slough and drop off, so as to prevent its be- coming an obstacle to the closure of the wound. Although wounds of the Stomach are not necessarily mortal, we can never look upon them as devoid of the utmost dan- ger, particularly if inflicted towards its pyloric extremity, or in the course of the great vessels running along its curva- tures. No organ in the whole animal economy seems to possess greater powers of adapting itself to circumstances than the stomach, both in man and in the inferior animals. The numerous instances of foreign bodies, such as stones, and even knives introduced into the human stomach ; the enormous balls of matted hair found in the stomachs of cattle, and the his- tory of the lamb mentioned in Captain Bligh’s voyage, which subsisted on animal food, prove to us that the stomach, an organ so essential to the existence of * the individual, is not easily deprived of its vitality, by the introduction of substances altogether foreign to its usual contents ; and the incisions purposely made for withdrawing such substances, as weir as the injuries inflicted by the usual accidents of war, prove also, that the stomach is capable of sustaining and re- Pairing the consequences of very formidable wounds. The interesting case detailed by Dr. Marcet, in the Medico- ’ Chirurgical Transactions, gives an example of a sailor who con- i tinued occasionally, for a succession of years, to entertain his ■ conn'ades by swallowing knives; and of the successful extraction ■ of knives from the human stomach, we have the well-known case of the Prussian peasant, operated on at Konigsberg upwards of two hundred years ago, as well as a more recent one mention- od by Baron Larrey, in which hi. Frizac successfully per- formed this operation at Toulouse. In these, operations the z

102 MILITARY SURGERY. Transport, with Suggestions for its Improvement,” show that he has considered the subject of military transport in all its bearings, and that his observations are the result of sound judgment and matured experience. I shall, therefore, make no farther apology for introducing the following extensive quotations from his work. “ The transport required by every army, independent of the ordnance service, which has its own peculiar establish- ments, may be classed under two heads; namely, that which is requisite to carry provisions, forage, and the ordin- ary supplies ; and that which is requisite to carry sick and wounded men; or, in other words, into Commissariat and Hospital transport.” “ But although the transport required by an army admits of being classed under these two heads, yet they again, in a great measure, resolve themselves into one, and require but one species of transport to supply both, more especially during an active campaign, when transport is most valuable ; because the wrants of each exist, principally in opposite directions; stores and supplies of all kinds requiring to be carried to the front, and sick men to the rear.” “ The first step, therefore, towards substantial improve- ment in our army transport, should be to adopt a carriage, simple in its construction, and applicable to the conveyance of every thing that an army requires to have carried.

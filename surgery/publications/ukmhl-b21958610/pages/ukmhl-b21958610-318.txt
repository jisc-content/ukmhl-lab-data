298 MILITARY SURGERY. with stupor and drowsiness, these symptoms gradually in- creasing, accompanied with insensibility, and assuming alto- gether an apoplectic character, there is every reason to pre- sume that the patient is suffering from extravasation of blood within the skull; and in every urgent case of this kind, the surgeon is, I think, warranted in perforating the cranium, making the part struck the centre of the perforation. This is a practice which some may hardly think justifiable, but in a case of this nature where matters are hurrying on from bad to worse, it appears to me, incumbent on the surgeon to have immediate recourse to an operation, which, from the insensibi- lity of the patient, adds little to his sufferings, and by which we may have the gratification of rescuing him from otherwise inevitable death. These immediate extravasations of blood are naturally most liable to occur from injuries in the course of the meningeal artery, or contiguous to the sutures where the blood-vessels are most numerous; and the symptoms are produced by the immediate effusion of blood making pressure on the brain and origin of the nerves so as to impair or abo- lish sense and voluntary motion. Another set of symptoms are caused by an inflamed or sloughy state of the membranes of the brain, and seldom af- fect the organs of sense until a late period of the disease, or until a considerable quantity of matter is formed, which makes pressure like any other fluid.

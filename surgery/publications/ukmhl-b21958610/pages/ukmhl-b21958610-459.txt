ophthalmia. 439 dangerous anil less destructive to vision than the second spe- cies, or ophthalmitis sclerotica of Dr. Vetch ; and the inflam- mation, when seated in the ins, is for the most part more difficult to subdue, and more apt to be followed by a perman- ent injury to the sight, than in either of the two fonner cases. Ophthalmia has frequently been referred to, and selected as an illustration of all the phenomena of inflammation, pain, swelling, heat and redness. Of the last particularly it exhibits a most striking example, from the contrast which the blood-red colour of the inflamed conjunctiva presents to its natural white or pearly appearance; at the same time the other symp- toms of inflammation above mentioned are often well mark- ed in this affection.

FEIONED AND FACTITIOUS DISEASES. 579 object of it can be distinctly seen. These last observations apply equally to cases of assumed idiocy or mental weakness, which in the case of a clever and persevering impostor it is extremely difficult to detect; most men having enjoyed “ op- portunities of studying the character in the instance of the poor idiot still to be met with at large in almost every village.’1 Solitary confinement, spare diet, bleeding, and repeated blis- ters or counter-irritants are amongst the most appropriate re- medies in real mania, and are not very tolerable to an impos- tor.

In cases where this disease is assumed either amongst the soldiery or in civil life, the times and places of attack are naturally selected, so that the paroxysm may not pass unobserved by those upon whom it is desirable to make an impression.

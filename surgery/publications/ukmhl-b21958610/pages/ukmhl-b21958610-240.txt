It is obvious, that a laceration of the integuments may take place without almost any degree of contusion. We may again have a considerable degree of contusion, without its going so far as to destroy the vitality of the lips of the wound ; or the contusion accompanying a wound may be such as entirely to destroy the contiguous texture. In the first two cases, the wound may be united wholly or partly by the adhesive inflammation, while in the last, suppuration or spha- celation to a certain extent must occur; and it is possible, indeed it is by no means unfrequent, in extensive wounds, that all these three states may be co-existent, and that one por- tion of a wound may be united by the first intention, while another part of it may fall into a state of suppuration, and a third sphacelate. It will be easily understood, that while sup- puration may take place in the external portion of a wound, the bottom of it may become agglutinated or reunited by ad- hesion, in consequence of the flesh being less injured in this situation, the force of the impinging body which inflicted the wound having in some degree spent itself upon the parts with which it first came into contact. In wounds penetrating so deeply as to expose the surface of a subjacent bone, it is de- sirable to reunite as speedily as possible the bottom or interior part of the wound, with a view of preventing an exfoliation of the bone. But it must be remarked, that when the wound is inflicted with a blunt instrument, and in consequence par-

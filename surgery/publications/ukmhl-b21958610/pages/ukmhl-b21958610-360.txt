MILITARY SURGERY. 340 fled as to treatment with the employment of general remedies, bleeding, abstinence, and rest. No man in his senses would think of enlarging the external wound, for the purpose of searching out and sewing up the wounded part of the gut; a practice, the propriety of which is not universally admitted, even when the wounded intestine protrudes externally. Ex- travasation of the contents of the bowels within the peritoneum is by no means so liable to occur as speculative writers would lead us to imagine, and when it does happen to any extent, the case may, for the most part, be abandoned as hopeless. Mr. Travers, in his Essay upon Injuries of the Intestines, has shewn distinctly the phenomena which wounded intes- tines present, and the processes adopted by nature in the re- pair of such injuries. From this inquiry it appears, that â€œ if a gut be punctured, the elasticity of the peritoneal coat, and the contraction of the muscular fibres, tend to open the wound, while the villous or mucous coat forms a sort of hernial pro- trusion and obliterates the aperture; if an incised wound be made, the edges are drawn asunder and reverted, so that the mucous coat protrudes in the form of a fleshy lip ; if the section be transverse, the lip is broad and bulbous, acquiring tume- faction and redness from the contraction of the circular fibres behind it; if the incision is according to the length of the cylinder, the lip is narrow, and the contraction of the longitu- dinal resisting that of the circular fibres, gives the orifice an oval form ; and of these two last mentioned incisions, the longitudinal and the transverse, it appears that the former are most easily rcpaired.1, How far art can be useful in promot- ing such repair, and what the form of suture best calculated to promote it, have been subjects of very warm discussion. This discussion, however, like many others, relative to wounded intestines, has been chiefly grounded on experi- ments instituted on brutes, and not on the practice of those most employed in the treatment of wounds in the human sub-

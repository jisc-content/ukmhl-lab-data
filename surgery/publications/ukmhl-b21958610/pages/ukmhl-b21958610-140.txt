From the ravages which it has occasionally com- mitted in the Royal Infirmary here, I was, at one time, greatly inclined to look upon it as connected with circumstances in the locality and construction of the building, and the un- cleanly habits of many of our patients in this country ; subse- quent observation, however, has made me inclined to attribute less to these local peculiarities, and more to general atmospheric causes. During the present season, for instance, although erysipelas has not been so prevalent in the Royal Infirmary as upon some former occasions, yet I have seen much more of it, both in private practice and in the Military Hospitals, than upon any former occasion ; several soldiers have died of it with- in the last year, both in the cavalry and infantry barracks; and the Queenâ€™s Bays, stationed at Piershill, have lost two officers, within a few months, from erysipelas supervening upon slight local injuries. In proceeding to consider the inflammatory affections of the other tissues, it may be observed, that the cellular mem- brane lying immediately under the skin, occupying also the interstices of the muscular fibres, and enveloping every vessel and nerve, is one of the most common seats of in- flammation, to which, when it occurs' in this particular texture, the term Phlegmon has been applied ; and from the appearances, progress, and terminations of which, the de- scriptions of inflammation adopted by most systematic writers have been chiefly borrowed. All the other membranes, as well as the cellular, are liable to inflammatory attacks, which, besides exhibiting the com- mon symptoms of inflammation, modify, alter, or destroy the natural secretions and functions of these membranes. On the first occurrence of inflammation in mucous membranes, the secretion from their surfaces is often for a time suspended, and this is succeeded by an increased formation of a thin acrimo- nious humour, or of a fluid bearing the character of pus ; and

Name me,1 says he, c one absurd or cruel measure—the am- putation of large pieces of the scalp—the widening of fissures, —the perforating the cranium with many trepans,—and open- ing the dura mater for every idle suspicion or imaginary pur- pose—name me, any extravagance for which their works do not afford us a precedent.1 ‘ Turn, again,’ says Mr. Bell, 4 to the works of more modern authors, and you would be persuaded that the more violent the fracture the less the danger; that your patient, though he lie in a deadly stupor with fractures of the skull, or deep wounds of the brain, needs but to lie undisturbed or unassisted to insure his perfect re- covery.1 “ Even in very recent times, we find the most distinguished surgeons of the day inculcating practices almost diametrically opposite ; Mr. Pott in England, encouraging a use of the trepan almost unlimited, and Desault in France, latterly renouncing it in toto,—his practice apparently becoming enfeebled as his experience increased. Nothing can possibly be more perplexing to students of surgery, than such differ- ence of sentiment between authors whose practical habits and extensive experience render it difficult to say which of the two is most worthy of your confidence.

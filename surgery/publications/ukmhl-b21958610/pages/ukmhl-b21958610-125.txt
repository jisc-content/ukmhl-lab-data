105 TRANSPORTATION OF SICK AND WOUNDED. It will be obvious, upon a moment’s reflection, that such accidents as this, occurring either from the failure of morses, or from the desertion, sickness, or incapacity of dri- vers, are much more easily remedied in cases where carts are employed than when waggons are the only means of convey- ance ; for “ when the weight of a load does not exceed what one horse is able to draw, skill in a driver ceases to be requi- site, and it may be led by any man, however inexperienced. ''Neither man nor horse require instruction.

When, in the Penin- sula, the more laborious and tedious method of carrying on he backs of mules was not resorted to, it was by carts that he magazines were supplied, from which the men and horses mployed with waggons drew their support ; it was by carts hat far the greater proportion of sick and wounded soldiers * ,-ere carried to hospitals in the rear; in short, it wasjby carts hat all the efficient wheel-carriage transport was performed.” After these and many more interesting observations on the ubject of military transport in general, Mr. Cherry concludes y observing, that he has at length succeeded in completing ' machine sufficiently near perfection to be submitted to a rial of its advantages, which he enumerates in his pamphlet, nd which may be seen in my introductory lectures, along with ie official reports upon this conveyance, from Dr. James oibes, and numerous military and medical officers at Cliat- am. Enough has been said to excite reflection and inquiry into

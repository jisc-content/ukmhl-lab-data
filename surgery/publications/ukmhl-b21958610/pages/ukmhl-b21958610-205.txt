HOSPITAL GANGRENE. 185 plete cicatrix had formed, and it was upwards of six months I before the part had regained the colour of the surrounding in- j t teguments. It is chiefly, however, with the appearances of this dis- ,<ease as supervening upon gun-shot wounds, upon stumps, jiand upon old suppurating surfaces, that, as military sur- igeons, we are concerned. And the following excellent de- • scription of it, by Staff-Surgeon Boggie, will be found in a Paper on Hospital Gangrene, published in the Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh. “ When a wound or ulcer is affected with contagious gangrene, it loses its healthy florid appearance, it becomes painful and > swollen, and the granulations which were small and distinct, ' become flabby, and appear sometimes as if they were dis- tended with air; at other times, vesicles containing a wa- Itery coloured fluid, or bloody serum, have been observed ; and i the sensation in the sore has been described as resembling the -stinging of a gnat. The secretion of pus is suspended, the 'wound is dry, and covered with a tenacious viscid ash-colour- i ed matter which adheres firmly to the surface. When this i morbid state has existed for some time, a discharge takes place of a thin ichorous matter of a very peculiar smell; the pain increases, the edges of the wound arc reverted, and in ge- neral assume a circular form ; an erysipelatous redness sur- rounds the wound, and sometimes extends to a great distance, even over a whole limb.

The inflammation goes on increasing, the thin ichor continues to be discharged in great quantity, and a thick slough, apparently of coagulated lymph,

MILITARY SURGERY. 382 formed the operation myself; and from the results of these, I am satisfied that in some cases of gunshot fractures of the elbow-joint, particularly in young subjects, the operation of excision may be successfully and advantageously performed. The hazardous character of wounds involving the hip-joint is well known to every experienced surgeon, and the removal of the thigh at the hip joint, recommended for some of these wounds, is an operation which no one can contemplate with any sanguine hopes of success. The experience which we have of the excision of the head of the femur, in cases of caries, is not extensive, but it appears to me to be encouraging; and since I have become familiar with the excision of other joints, I have frequently reflected upon the possibility of sub- stituting the operation of excision for that of amputation at the hip-joint, in some of those cases of gunshot wounds where the latter has been recommended. That the operation might be performed with facility, I make no doubt. I have been in the habit of shewing in my class for a number of years, that by a perpendicular incision along the bone on the outside of the joint, and by another crossing it at right angles, the head of the femur may be excised, even when the head and neck of the bone are not previously broken or comminuted ; and when this is the case, the operation would of course be greatly faci- litated. I should scarcely expect by such an operation to save a useful limb, but it should never be forgotten, that in cases requiring amputation at the hip-joint, it is not only the patientâ€™s limb, but his life which is deeply involved. Excision of the knee-joint is an operation which I have twice witnessed for chronic disease, and although one case was successful, it is not an operation which I consider advis- able in any case of recent wound, or hardly in any circum- stances whatever. In cases of compound luxation at the ankle joint, the re- moval of the protruding extremity of the bone by the saw has

155 ULCERS. for the cure of ulcers were endless in number, and often [highly injurious in effect. A more rational pathology has t taught us that very simple means will accomplish every thing \ which art can effect in the treatment of ulcers; and circum- stances have concurred to render the employment even of these ssimple means less frequently necessary. In the introductory part of a treatise upon ulcers of the legs, [published by Sir Edward Home, there are some interesting oobservations on the frequency of this complaint amongst sol- diers, and on the state of decrepitude and inefficiency to which* - regiments were sometimes reduced by the prevalence of ulcers. 'Sir Everard observes, that “ no surgical complaint incident to the soldier has deprived his majesty’s service of so many men sas that of ulcers in the legs,” a remark which will not apply tto the present state of the service. This favourable change is [partly to be attributed to an increased vigilance in excluding :from the service men who are suffering, or who may have suf- fered from this complaint previously to their enlistment; partly ito the improved modes of treatment which have been adopted ; but above all, I believe, to the great amelioration in the condition of the soldier, which has taken place under the auspices of the late Duke of York, and the present com- : mander-in-chief. The increased comforts with which the soldier is provided, the prospect of obtaining his discharge .at the end of a stated time, without having recourse to stra- tagem to procure it; the prospect of a pension upon com- jipleting a given period of service; the diminished frequency and extent of corporal punishments ; and the difficulty of ^finding employment in manufacturing and agricultural pur- -suits, arc all circumstances which have greatly tended to make ■ a soldiers life more desirable, and must have a powerful effect m diminishing the frequency of ulcers, by taking away the temptation to produce or to aggravate such complaints. ^ c h;lve now no ulcer of any formidable character occurrincr " O 3

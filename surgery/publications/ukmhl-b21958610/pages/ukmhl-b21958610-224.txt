For all wounds of considerable extent the straps in common use are those composed of the em- plastrum adhaesivum of the pharmacopoeias, spread upon linen; and my own experience does not lead me to offer any import- ant objection to its use, although I have sometimes been in- clined to think that the irritation of the resinous matter which enters into its composition, and the complete obstruction of the pores of the skin by the plaster, have a tendency to excite cutaneous or erysipelatous inflammation. As a substitute for the common adhesive strap, slips of ribbon, or of linen, dipped in a strong alcoholic solution of isinglass, have of late been extensively and successfully used by Mr. Liston in the Royal Infirmary here. The next means employed for retaining the surfaces of in- cised wounds in contact is the use of sutures ; this practice amongst the older surgeons was executed in a variety of fan- ciful ways ; hence the twisted—the interrupted—the quilled— the glover’s—the herring bone,—and many different species of sutures ; some of them, however, while they were well adapt- ed to the purposes of the glover, the shoemaker, the saddler, or other artists, operating upon dead animal matter, were but ill calculated to be transferred to the living system ; here the reunion of parts depends upon a regulated degree of inflam- mation, and there can be no doubt that the abuse of sutures, in former days, was one of the principal means which frus- trated the purposes they were intended to serve, by exciting such a degree of inflammation as necessarily terminated in suppuration. One of the first surgeons whose eyes were open- ed to this mischievous effect of sutures, was M. Pibrac, a mem- ber of the French academy of surgery ; in the memoirs of which body will be found a paper by this gentleman, con- demning very generally the use of sutures, and instancing particularly wounds of the lower belly, of the tongue, of the throat, of the tendons, cases of hare-lip, and various

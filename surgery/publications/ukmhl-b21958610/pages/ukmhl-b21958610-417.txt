LUXATIONS. 397 the difficulties of reduction were in that instance so groat as to induce the surgeon to cut across both “ the common ten- don of the extensor muscles above, and the ligament below the patella.” Even this desperate measure was unsuccessful, and the patient died of the consequences. Dislocations of the ankle-joint, with fracture of the lower part of the fibula, are cases of every-day occurrence, and their treatment well understood, particularly since the publication of Dupuytren’s Memoir on fractures of the fibula, in which a simple and effectual apparatus is recommended. The ankle- joint is remarkable as being one of the most common seats of compound dislocation ; and although I have known several in- stances of recovery from that accident, yet, in severe injuries of this kind, and particularly when a patient cannot be im- mediately and permanently placed in favourable circum- stances, as often happens in military life, the surgeon will, I believe, best consult his patient’s interest by an immediate removal of the limb. In taking a retrospective view of the several luxations, I would observe that those of the shoulder and of the hip-joints are accidents the nature of which have been well investigated, and the treatment of which is as satisfactory as the circum- stances warrant us to expect. The luxations and injuries of the elbow-joint are so numerous and obscure as to render them fit objects of future inquiry. The luxation of the thumb, to which I have adverted, is an accident of which the nature is not satisfactorily explained, and of which the treatment is very unsuccessful. Luxation of the patella is liable to occur fiom an accident to which horsemen are frequently exposed, and its reduction is sometimes difficult, its consequences, as wre have seen, having in one instance been most deplorable. Luxations of tbe ankle-joint, the last to which I have advert- ed, are, in their simple state, treated, for the most part, with

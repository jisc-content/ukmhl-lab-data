MILITARY SURGERY. 312 elastic gum tube into the oesophagus, for the purpose of con- veying into his stomach strong soup or beef-tea, on which he was fed for years. When apertures in the trachea have re- mained long in a fistulous state, the portion of the tube above the wound contracts greatly in diameter, so as to prevent the possibility of closing the wound until the canal is again re- stored by dilatation to its proper dimensions. With this view a series of bougies or plugs progressively increasing in diameter, have in some instances been successfully employed here by Mr. Liston, evincing in a very remarkable manner thejiberty w-hich we can take with these parts in the way of operation; and demonstrating a fact which has often been ob- served, that in examining and dressing wounds about the fau- ces or throat, the tickling sensation produced by treating the parts with extreme delicacy, is less easily borne than more rough handling. Wounds of the primitive carotids, are so generally fatal that it wrere idle to enlarge upon them. We have indeed an instance recorded by Baron Larrey, of an officer wound- ed at the siege of Acre, by a musket shot, said to have opened the common carotid, and in which the patient was saved by one of the artillerymen plugging up the orifice with his fingers until the Baron came to his assistance; but the case is given with so imperfect a detail as to render it but little instructive. In the event of balls or small shot lodging in the region of the neck, we are much hampered in our efforts to remove them by the contiguity of the large vessels and nerves, but, in some cases of this kind, one of which is related by Baron Percy, nature has found a chan- nel for the exit of the ball by its perforating the oesophagus, passing into the stomach, and being ultimately discharged by stool. Wounds on the back part of the neck require no pecu- liarity of treatment; they are not dangerous nor attended with any peculiar symptoms unless they penetrate so deeply as to

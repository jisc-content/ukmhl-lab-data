TUNCTURED WOUNDS. 211 The foregoing remarks are chiefly applicable to wounds when treated with the hope of procuring adhesion ; when we are likely to fail in this, and are threatened with an excess of i inflammation in the treatment of wounds, the practice of co- vering the wound with pledgets, or compresses soaked in cold ' water, is peculiarly applicable in military life, and is, in gene- ral, preferable to the common practice of enveloping wounds 1 in a poultice; the latter is only applicable when the hope of 2 a cure by adhesion is given up, when the extent of inflam- mation is such as to render a different termination inevitable, when, in short, the only alternative is between suppura- tion and gangrene. Having considered the phenomena more particularly observ- able in simple incised wounds, and noticed the means to be ladopted in their treatment, it is unnecessary, in considering the other descriptions of wounds, to enlarge upon those circum- stances in which they agree with incised wounds ; and instead of recapitulating what has already been said, it will perhaps lead to a more accurate and satisfactory knowledge of the sub- ject, to treat it, as it were, by contrast, and to notice chiefly -ithosc points in which punctured, lacerated, and contused â€¢wounds differ from those inflicted by incision. Punctured wounds are so called from the pointed figure of the weapons with which they are inflicted, and from their penetrating to a depth disproportioned to the extent of the external opening. Those to which soldiers and seamen are more particularly exposed, are inflicted with the lance, the small sword, the bayonet, or the boarding-pike. Wounds nflicted by the former of these instruments, partake in some degree of the nature of incised wounds, and while they may, n the first instance, be more dangerous from being attended vith greater hemorrhage, they are less liable to be followed >y that extensive and diffuse inflammation, and that subse- [uent formation and lodgment of matter, which constitute so

GONORRHOEA. 501 ami points out the propriety, when we have no previous ex- perience of this circumstance, of beginning in all cases with those metallic solutions in a very diluted state, augmenting the strength of the solution according to the circumstances of the case and the feelings of the patient. A solution of the most active of all these salts, the nitrate of silver, in the quantity of a scruple and even half a drachm to an ounce of water, was some years ago, in consequence of some reports in favour of it, suggested by the heads of the Army Medical Department, as deserving the consideration of regimental surgeons. How far the general reports upon this practice were favourable, or how many of the army surgeons thought themselves jus- tified in giving trial to it, I am unable to say. I my- self had recourse to it in the cases of two soldiers of the 33d regiment, of which I was then surgeon; but although these men recovered quickly, it was at the expense of so much suffering, that I hesitate to recommend it as a gene- ral practice. The report formerly alluded to from the 88th regiment, gives the following results of twenty cases treat- ed by an injection of a scruple of the nitrate of silver to an ounce of plain boiled water, these were discharged cured at various periods from ten to forty-two days, the average length of time being seventeen days. The above statement, to say nothing of the sufferings of the individuals, cither present or future, is, I think, amply sufficient to deter any j udicious prac- titioner from the repetition of a practice of the success of which, without at all adverting to its hazard, there is so little reason to boast; for in the very same report there is a statement of the results of fifteen cases treated solely by rest and abstinence; of these, three were discharged cured in three days, and the rest at intermediate periods, up to the twenty-third day, the average being little more than eight days. In the early stages of gonorrhoea, much may be effected by subjecting the patient to confinement, strict regimen and an- tiphlogistic remedies, with the timely interposition of a \ vo-

WOUNDS OF THE HEAD. 293 alone were the cause of erysipelatous inflammation superven- ing upon the wounds of the scalp ; but the numerous in- stances which we see of erysipelas supervening on punctured wounds of the head, where neither stitches nor straps are em- ployed, seem to me a sufficient refutation of this opinion. But it is enough for our present purpose, to notice the fact, .and to state, that the most effectual means of sub- duing it, arc the free discharge of blood from the wound, or from its immediate neighbourhood ; the employment of mer- curial and saline purgatives ; antimonials in nauseating doses ; cold saturnine lotions to the head ^ the most abstemious diet; and rigid abstinence from wine or spirituous liquors. In gunshot wounds of the head, the injury is seldom con- fined to the scalp, but is found to implicate the bone or the brain itself, and to give rise to the symptoms familiarly known to surgeons as those of Concussion or Compression of the brain. It will therefore be necessary to advert briefly to these before proceeding to the consideration of fractures of the skull, and the lodgment of foreign bodies within the cra- nium. Co7icussion is sometimes the result of a severe blow on the head, in consequence of a solid body impinging against it: in consequence however of the flexibility of the neck, the head yields in some degree to the impetus of a projectile, and hence concussion is less frequently the consequence of wounds than of falls from a height. In the latter case it is possible, and indeed it is not uncommon, that concussion of the brain may take place, although the head itself should not have come in contact with the ground, or with any solid body. The most prominent symptoms are an immediate abolition of sense and motion; the pulse weak, slow, and intermitting, the respira-* tion languid, sometimes scarcely perceptible ; the iris is insen- sible to the stimulus of light; and the extremities cold and lclaxcd. These symptoms are sometimes transient, and in

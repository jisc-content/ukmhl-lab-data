STRICTURES. 507 withdrawing it, have been considered undeniable proofs of mus- cularity in the membrane of the urethra ; but these phenomena may be otherwise explained, and none of them give a satisfactory proof of muscular contraction. In short, I know of no anatomical observations which decidedly prove the existence of such muscu- larity, nor have 1 met in the course of a good deal of experience with any phenomena in the living body calculated to impress me with a belief in the existence of spasmodic or muscular ac- tion in the fore part of the urethra, anterior to the insertion of the acceleratores urinae. As much of the doctrine relative to the formation and to the treatment of strictures has been built upon the supposition of a muscular power in the urethra, I have thought it necessary to offer the foregoing remarks on this point, previously to a consideration of the site, the nature, and the cure of stricture. The doctrine of spasm has engross- ed too much attention in the consideration of this disease, and I cannot help suspecting that it has occasionally been found a convenient means of explaining a failure in the introduction of the bougie, and this, even where such force has been used as would have overcome any muscular power which the urethra can be supposed to exert; which would in- deed have lacerated any part of that membranous canal, had it not been strengthened by the deposition of adventitious matter from disease. On examining accurately the dimensions of the urethra, we observe that one of the narrowest parts of the canal is immediately behind the bulb, and that it is also less capa- cious towards the root of the penis from three inches and a half to four inches and a half from the external orifice, and those are points at which, according to Sir Everard Home, strictures most frequently take place. My own ob- servations enable me to concur entirely with this distinguish- ed surgeon in fixing upon the former of these spots, viz. the contraction immediately behind the bulb, as a common scat of

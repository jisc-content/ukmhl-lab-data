46 MILITARY SURGERY profuse perspirations induced by active military operations, the quantity of sordes collected about the persons of soldiers by marching on dirty roads, or even going through the evo- lutions of a field day, are only to be removed by perfect ablu- tion ; and for this purpose bathing should be encourag- ed, wherever circumstances and season render it practicable. One of the most important steps toward personal cleanliness which the English army has made, since I knew any thing of it, is the general adoption of cropping, and the consequent abolition of those quantities of powder, soap and pomatum, with which the heads of the soldiers used to be besmeared. “ To live comfortably,” says General Maitland, “ men must be cleanly; it improves every advantage and lessens every evil ; cleanliness in the person of a soldier, and in the bar- racks and hospital, are almost certain indications of a good regiment.” The benefits which accrue to health from habits of exer- cise are so well understood, that it is surprising to find strong prejudices sometimes existing upon this subject; some officers in the army, although disposed to take plenty of exercise at their own time, and in their own way, are quite unable to see the utility or advantage of being summoned at an early hour in the morning to parade for drill along with the men.

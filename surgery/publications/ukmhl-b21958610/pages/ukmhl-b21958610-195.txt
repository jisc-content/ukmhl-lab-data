HOSPITAL GANGRENE. There is every reason to believe, that under peculiar cir- cumstances, wounds and open sores must at all times have been liable to assume some of the features of Hospital Gan- grene. But it is only in times comparatively recent, that we have any minute or accurate account of this formidable disease. Although it was seen by La Motte in the early part of the last century, yet there is no distinct and separate

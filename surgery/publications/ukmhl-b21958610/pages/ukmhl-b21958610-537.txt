517 STRICTURES. have been adopted. The French surgeons from the days of Pare downwards, and particularly encouraged by the example of Desault, have been in the habit of forcing a passage into the bladder by means of a conical silver catheter, “ sonde conique d’argentbut such a practice is very far from being generally advisable, for the strictured part of the urethra is for the most part much firmer and stronger than the rest of the canal, and it will readily be understood how much more easily an instrument of this description will lacerate the sound, than dilate the diseased portion of the tube. Puncturing the bladder, is in such cases another ex- pedient occasionally resorted to, but this only affords a tem- porary relief, and in no degree tends to better the condition of the strictured part, except, in as far as, by abating the irri- tation, it allows the spasmodic and inflammatory action in the parts to subside; after which we are sometimes again enabled to carry a bougie or catheter into the bladder through the urethra. The third, and what I conceive the best practice in such cases, is to open the urethra behind the stricture, wherc- ever this is so situated as to render such an opening practica- ble from the perinamm, and by continuing our incision for- wards through the stricture, we may be immediately enabled to carry a flexible catheter from the point of the penis into the bladder, and proceed to heal the wound in the perinamm over it. By this practice we give immediate relief to the urgent symptoms from the retention of urine, and by the re- moval of the stricture we obviate their recurrence. There are some excellent observations on this subject in Mr. Shaw’s second paper in the Medico-Chi rurgical Transactions, where he inculcates the propriety of patients submitting to this practice, even in cases where a complete retention has not taken place, with a view to obviate other serious consequences of stricture. This practice I was induced to employ twenty- two years ago, in the case of a soldier of the Royals, who be-

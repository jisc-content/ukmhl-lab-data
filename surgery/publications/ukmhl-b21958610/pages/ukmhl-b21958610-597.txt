In lecturing upon this subject I am in the habit of teaching chiefly by examples, giving, in addition to the cases which have fallen under my own observation, a selection from those contained in the writings of Marshall, Cheyne, Hutchison, Hennen, and in the article “ Feigned Diseases,’ in the Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine ; here however I shall content myself with a few general remarks on the most com- mon impostures practised by soldiers and seamen, the charac- teristic distinctions between real and feigned diseases, the means by which artificial diseases are frequently produced, and the best means of counteracting imposition. „ The diseases assumed by malingerers, or “ hospital birds, as they are technically termed in the service, are various, ac- cording as they are assumed for temporary or permanent purposes—for the purpose of admission into the sick list, or of procuring their discharge from the service.

MILITARY SURGERY. 3 02 the cranium, it be in all cases advisable to institute a pro- tracted search for them, requires some consideration. Every surgeon will, I am persuaded, be disposed to make the at- tempt ; but before commencing an unguided search after them, it becomes us seriously to weigh the additional injury which we may inflict. On the one hand, we have numerous cases recorded in the writings of Quesnay, of Larrey, of Hen- lien, and of other military surgeons, in which balls and other metallic bodies have been extracted from the cranium with suc- cess ; on the other hand, there are numerous instances both of pointed bodies and of musket balls remaining imbedded in the brain, even for months or years ; and in some such cases, the extraction of the foreign body has been immediately fol- lowed by alarming symptoms which did not previously exist, and even by fatal consequences. In favour of immediate extraction, amongst other interest- ing cases, a very remarkable one is recorded by Baron Larrey, in which he traced a musket ball by means of an elastic bou- gie, from its entrance at the frontal sinus to its lodgment un- der the lambdoidal suture, and by a corresponding measure- ment externally, he was enabled to apply the trepan over its site, to extract it with facility, and to relieve his patient from the symptoms of compression under which he laboured. This may be compared with another case referred to by the same writer, in which a portion of the blade of a javelin lodged in the brain for fourteen years, and was successfully extracted at the end of that period. This case may again be contrasted with one recorded in Turnbullâ€™s Naval Surgeon, in which a portion of an iron spindle, three inches long, remained sunk for a period of eight years, in the orbit and brain of a child, and where febrile symptoms ending fatally supervened upon its extraction. So various indeed are the results of cases in which foreign bodies have been lodged within the cranium, and so little has

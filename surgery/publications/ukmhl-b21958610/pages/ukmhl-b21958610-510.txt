MILITARY SURGERY. 4U0 Hunter divides the different surfaces to which contagious matter may be applied into secreting and non-secreting surfaces ; the former of which, including the urethra and other mucous mem- branes, when subjected to irritation or excitement, afford an increased or altered secretion, and the latter, comprising the external teguments, are more prone to ulceration. The ex- ternal surface of the glans and the lining membrane of the prepuce, the most usual seats of chancre or venereal ulceration, are not precisely in the situation either of secreting or non- secreting textures; but as these surfaces, when irritated by the application of the venereal virus, are found to assume the ul- cerative inflammation, Mr. Hunter has chosen to consider them more akin to the non-secreting surfaces. This is how- ever in a great measure a gratuitous assumption, for the natural secretion of sebaceous matter under the prepuce is in many individuals profuse, and in some instances it is so far increased as to constitute a disease termed gonorrhoea spuria. But to appeal from this hypothetical reasoning to facts, it must be admitted, that if both gonorrhoea and syphilis are the results of the same poison, we ought oc- casionally, nay frequently, to see the one affection communi- cated by a patient labouring under the other. Now this is on all hands avowedly so rare an occurrence, that the abettors of the opinion which holds the two diseases to proceed from the same virus, have been forced to the necessity of defending their views by a few cases, questionable in their nature, sus- ceptible of different explanations, and resting upon the testi- mony of ignorant, interested, or prejudiced witnesses ; while, on the other hand, the cases which tend to prove that gonor- rhoea is invariably produced from gonorrhoea, and chancre from chancre, arc unlimited in number, unequivocal in their na- ture, and supported by the most unexceptionable testimony both of medical men and of others. The chief supporters of the identity of the two diseases me

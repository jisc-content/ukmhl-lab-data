GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 231 ,either of the former; but like the others, it wants the sup- port of positive evidence, while much negative evidence may be brought against it.” Circumstances are constantly occurring, such as the removal dof portions of the soldier’s dress or accoutrements by balls, with- ,out any injury to his person, which militate against all the (explanations given of the wind ol a ball, burgeons seem now lgenerally agreed, that the accidents ascribed to this cause ccannot happen without the actual contact ol the ball. And this is no new observation, lor it is stated by Johnson, that “ when another Dutch war broke out in 16/2, Sheffield ivent again a volunteer in the ship which the celebrated Loid Ossory commanded, and there made, as he relates, two curious remarks —“ I have observed two things which I dare affirm, : though not generally believed. One was, that the wind ol a can- mon bullet, though flying never so near, is incapable of doing i the least harm ; and, indeed, were it otherwise, no man above (deck would escape.” It is not difficult to conceive that, 'where the injury is fatal from an internal lesion, death may t take place so suddenly as to afford no time for the develop- 1 ment of any external mark of the accident; and we are assured by Karon Larrey, that in all such cases he has found so much (disorder and disorganization internally, as leave him no room i to doubt of the mechanical contact of the ball. The following is I the Baron’s explanation of the phenomenon; an explanation, so I far as I can judge, quite analogous to that suggested in Sir Gil- 1 bert Blanc’s work ; and in which, also, Mr. Guthrie, the first authority in this country, seems disposed to concur. He says, “ a cannon ball is propelled at first with a rectilinear move- ment ; and if during this part of its course it strikes against any part of the human body, it carries it away; but the ball, after having traversed a certain distance, undergoes some change of motion in consequence of the resistance of the at- mosphere and the attraction of the earth, and turns on its

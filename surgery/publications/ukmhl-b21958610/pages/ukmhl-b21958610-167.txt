HUH NS. 147 distinctly; but the sympathy existing between the skin and the lungs, from their both being exhalant surfaces ; the ad- ditional load thrown upon the latter by the cessation of the functions of the skin over a large surface, and the great dyspnoea which often exists during the life of the patient, all appear to me circumstances which render it highly pro- bable that the lungs are the organs most likely to suffer. Some of the French writers, full of the gastro-ententic doc- tune, attribute the patient’s death in such cases to inflam- mation of the internal surfaces of the abdominal viscera; but from whichever of these sources the danger may be ap- prehended, the indications in the acute stage of the symp- tomatic fever, are the same,—the exhibition of mild evacu- ants, laxatives, diaphoretics, and opiates, with the employment of blood-letting, whenever the severity of the symptoms re- quires it, or the vigour of the patient’s constitution admits of such a means of cure. After the lapse of ten or fifteen days, the severity of the febrile symptoms generally abates, and in favourable cases, a progressive amendment goes on ; but in severe cases, a temporary diminution of the febrile action, about the period just specified, docs not always indicate an exemption from ‘ danSer ’ fur thc febrile action is liable to recur, and the patient 1 may bc camed off b7 such recurrence, at any time from three to six weeks after the injury. When death occurs after this period, the patient for the most part sinks in a hectic state, ' exhausted by a profuse discharge of matter from an extensive suppurating surface. Here the indications are, to support the sinking powers by nutritious diet, by the exhibition of porter and wine; to obviate diarrhoea by opiates, and profuse sweat- ing by mineral acids. I o recapitulate, then, the leading indications for the inter- nal treatment of severe burns; the exquisite pain, the constitu- tional shock, and nervous agitation, immediately succeeding the

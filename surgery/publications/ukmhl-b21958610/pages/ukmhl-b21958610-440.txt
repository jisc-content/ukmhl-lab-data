420 MILITARY SURGERY. yet lie states that in one of them only could the fatal event be attributed to the operation. He considers it to be less danger- ous than amputation of the thigh, a statement in which my own experience of the result of seven cases leads me to concur. Of nineteen cases of primary amputation at the shoulder-joint in the army, under the Duke of Wellington, from June to December 1814, sixteen recovered, two were transferred to distant hospitals, but considered out of danger, and only one died. In the French army the results seem to have been equally satisfactory. Baron Larrey performed this operation in sixteen cases during the Egyptian campaign, and of these he lost but two, after the battle of Wagram, and of Essling, out of fourteen cases he lost but two ; a similar train of success seems to have attended this operation in his hands on other occasions, and it is stated, generally, that in the I rench army 90 out of 100 have recovered. Amputations of the toes are almost uniformly performed at their junction with the metatarsal bones, and here they are best done, as in the fingers, by two lateral and equal flaps. Partial amputation of the foot at the junction of the meta- tarsal bones with those of the tarsus, or through the tarsus itself, immediately in front of the astragalus and os calcis, are operations often successfully performed. So far as these can be rendered intelligible by description alone, Mr. Gu- thrie’s observations upon this subject leave nothing to be de- sired, and Maingault’s plates, which I am in the habit of exhibiting to my pupils when performing these operations on the dead body, contribute much to a right understand- ing of the various modifications of amputation which may here be practised. With reference to the operation through the tarsus, or what has been termed Chopart’s operation, the utility of which has sometimes been questioned, I may state, from my own observation, that in two cases where this

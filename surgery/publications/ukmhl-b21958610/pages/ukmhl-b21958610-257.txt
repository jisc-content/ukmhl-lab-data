237 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. ; ticular directions for the extraction of foreign bodies when im- hbedded between, or in the substance of bones. And while wc ! have in this author, so far as I know, the first mention of lleaden halls as wounding bodies, we have also, perhaps, to at- tribute to him the foundation of the practice of scarifying and dilating gunshot wounds, which many subsequent writers have tenforced with so much energy, and which, without due con- Ifidence in the resources of nature, have been often practised '"with painful and injurious effects. 'I he indications in the treatment of gunshot wounds vary considerably according to the extent of the injury. The prin- cipal objects are, to remove the ball if it has lodged, or any extraneous substance which may have been carried in with it, —to remove also any fragments of bone which have become so j completely detached as to afford no hope of reunion, and which are of course, to all intents and purposes, acting as fo- reign bodies,—to secure any important blood-vessels which 'may have been wounded,—to circumscribe the inflammation by ‘the adoption of the most vigorous antiphlogistic practice, and, co* course, to limit the suppuration, without a considerable ex- ttent of which a gunshot wound seldom heals. If a musket ball passes through the fleshy part of a limb, our practice is 'simply to sponge the orifices clean, and to cover them with a little scraped lint, securing it with two cross slips of adhesive plaster, and keeping the limb as much as possible at rest. If (the ball has passed through the parietes of the chest or abdo- imen, and if no hemorrhage ensues, we are, in addition to the above simple mode of dressing both orifices of the wound, to have recourse to the abstraction of blood, say from twelve to 11 twenty ounces, according to the age, size, and state of health of the patient; and this precaution of bleeding is equally ne- ' ecssary where balls or splinters of shells may have produced much contusion of the head, trunk, or great joints, even when hno wound or solution of continuity occurs.

Although Gardener’s recovery was rapid, and his stump in every respect a good one, yet the con- sideration of this case gave rise to a remark for which I am entirely indebted to Dr. Lubbock, and which I consider well entitled to your attention. In a case like the present, where the tendons have been torn through, or disengaged at their distal extremities, and where the amputation is perform- ed by transfixing the limb with a catline and cutting out- wards, the tendons, from the resistance which they give to the edge of the knife, are in some measure drawn upwards, and are thus cut longer and less smoothly than is desirable ; this remark will obviously apply more forcibly as we come farther down in the lore-arm, the tendons being here cut with move difficulty, and less intimately connected by cellular adhesions. “ Although decidedly favourable to the double flap opera- tion in a large proportion of cases, yet I am not an advocate for its indiscriminate use, and I am desirous that none of its occasional inconveniences should escape notice, in order that we may be prepared to avoid them; in the case specified above, the simple expedient of making an assis- tant grasp the wrist firmly will, 1 think, enable us to do so.” With reference to another case, I find the following re- marks. “ This case, I am induced to mention, not from any very instructive lesson to be gathered from its progress, much less for any thing very unexpected in its event, but to caution you against an accident which occurred during the operation. While passing the knife through the fore-arm, from the radial to the ulnar side, for the purpose of forming

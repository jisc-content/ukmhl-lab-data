MILITARY SURGERY. ICO visions ; the men’s constitutions were in consequence much tainted with scurvy, and upon being exposed to musquito bites after landing, the trifling sores produced by these animals de- generated into ulcers of the most formidable description, thus affording an example of a very common occurrence,—an ulcer acknowledging both a local and constitutional cause. In such cases the ulcerative process advances with great rapidity, and soon removes a great extent of parts, sparing nothing which comes within its range; the blood-vessels are thus often ex- posed to the ravages of ulceration, and we have not unfre- quently an extensive haemorrhage superaddcd to the other ef- fects of the ulcer. Sometimes an ulcer, after having extended itself rapidly for a time, appears to receive a check, and becomes stationary for a long period ; sometimes it even advances to- wards a cure, and again suddenly resumes a destructive ac- tion. These phenomena were remarkably conspicuous in those ulcers which occurred amongst the men of the Royals after their arrival in India. It was then a very common thing to find an ulcer to all appearance doing well at the evening visit, and upon inquiring for the patient next morning, he frequent- ly observed,—“ My leg is going back, Sir.” And this alter- nate deterioration and improvement in the appearance of ul- cers occurs often without our being able to give a satisfactory account of it, or to promote the amendment of such sores be- yond a given point. Large ulcers, as I have already hinted, were often attributed to very trifling causes, such as scratches, bruises, and, above all, to the bites of musquitoes, which in place of healing up kindly, degenerated into foul and painful ulcers, with ragged edges, extensive surrounding inflamma- tion, and an ichorous offensive discharge. These sores, for the most part, spread rapidly, and often as it were by piece- meal, large portions of the inflamed parts contiguous to the ulcer falling out in gangrenous patches, and often laying the

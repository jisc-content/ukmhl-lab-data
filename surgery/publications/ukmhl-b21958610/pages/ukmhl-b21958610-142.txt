Bones, the most solid and compact parts of our system, are susceptible of inflammation from many causes which the mili- tary and naval surgeon have abundant opportunities of witness- ing ; and although the progress of inflammation is often slow and protracted in this texture, it still exhibits those phenomena by which it is characterised in other tissues. The death or mor- tification of bone, termed necrosis, with the separation of the dead parts from the living, is a process of a very remarkable nature, and requires often a great length of time for its com- pletion. The constitutional symptoms attending this process vary exceedingly in-t severity ; and where the disease is ex- tensive, often assume the form of hectic fever. The muscular fibres, the nerves, the blood-vessels, both ar- teries and veins, and the lymphatic vessels, are all structures susceptible of inflammation, and alfording peculiarities which we shall have other opportunities of noticing. It may be re- marked, that the liability of different textures to inflame is, generally speaking, proportioned to the number of capillary vessels which they contain, and to the nerves which they re- ceive ; the skin, the mucous, the cellular, and serous mem- branes, and the parenchymatous substance of the internal or- gans, are the textures most susceptible of this affection ; parts of a fibrous structure, such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, and aponeuroses, are less liable to inflammation, and less so still are the bones and cartilages ; while some portions of the structure, such as the epidermis, the nails, and hairs, arc al- together unsusceptible of this process. Inflammation has long been looked upon as terminating in Resolution, Suppuration, or Gangrene; but more recent and ac- curate observation has led to a subdivision of these, or at least.

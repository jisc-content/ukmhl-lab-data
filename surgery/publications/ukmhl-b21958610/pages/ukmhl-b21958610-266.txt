MILITARY SURGERY. 246 suture. The process followed by nature in the spontaneous suppression of haemorrhage, or in closing the mouth of a divided artery, was first investigated by Petit in ] 731, and this investi- gation was subsequently prosecuted by Morand and Pouteau, as well /is by our countrymen Sharpe, Gooch, Aitkin, Kirkland, and John Bell. About the beginning of the present century the farther investigation of this matter was undertaken by Dr. Jones while prosecuting his studies at this university, and his observations were given to the public in a work on haemorrhage, published in London in 1805. In this essay, Dr. Jones takes a much more comprehensive view of the subject than any of his predecessors, and in his explanation of the natural process for closing the orifice of a divided artery, notices the changes which take place—in the tunics of the wounded artery itself—in the cellular sheath embracing it,—in the blood circulating through it—and in the soft parts contiguous to it. His experiments show, that the blood, the action and the structure of arteries, their sheath, and even the cellular substance connecting them with it, in short, that all the parts concerned in, or affected by haemorrhage contribute to arrest its fatal progress. “ An impetuous flow of blood, a sudden and forcible retraction of the artery within its sheath, and a slight contraction of its ex- tremity, are the immediate, and almost simultaneous effects of its division.” This again, as the impetus of the circulation diminishes from the loss of blood, is followed by the forma- tion of a plug or coagulum within the sheath of the vessel, termed the external coagulum, and forming the “ first com- plete barrier to the effusion of blood.11 “ The mouth of the artery being no longer pervious, nor a collateral branch very near it, the blood just within it is at ' rest, coagulates, and forms in general a slender conical coagu- lum, which neither fills up the canal of the artery, nor ad- heres to its sides, except by a small portion of the circumfer- ence of its base, which lies near the extremity of the vessel

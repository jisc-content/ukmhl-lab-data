209 WOUNDS. ©us constriction of the limb must follow, when the swelling arising from the wound has come on. These are the chief objects of attention in the first dressing of wounds, and some of the steps to which I have now ad- verted,—the securing of blood-vessels, and the stitching of wounds,—fall to be performed once for all ; others, the applica- tion of plasters and bandages, are to be renewed from time to time, more or less frequently, according to the profusion of the discharge, the heat of the atmosphere, the feelings of the pa- tient, or other accidental circumstances. When no untoward occurrence takes place, the first dressings need seldom be dis- turbed in a shorter period than from three to five days, and where the feelings of the patient, the swelling and tension of the parts contiguous to a wound, or the occurrence of an of- fensive discharge from it, do not call upon us to interfere, the dressings may be left undisturbed until the wound be com- pletely healed. Every surgeon must have seen the advan- tage of such a practice, in clean cuts about the fingers, from the common accidents of civil life ; and for the extension of this practice we have very ample authority, both of old and re- cent date, from the time of Magatus down to our own day ; in which we have instances recorded by Sir Astley Cooper, of those formidable wounds which occur in compound luxations of the ankle joint healed by simply covering them with pledgets ol lint soaked in blood, and leaving them undisturbed. In proceeding to the dressing of wounds, the first point upon which it is necessary to caution the young surgeon, is the idle and injurious practice of probing wounds without any defi- nite object in view, and thereby adding to the sufferings of his patient, without increasing his own information. “ We ought never to probe a wound where probing can be of no use, and should be contented to remain ignorant of those things which, if known, could only gratify an idle curio- 1*

WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 363 the last may frequently be attained by a piece of pasteboard and a roller. It will readily be understood, that both these objects, the setting and retention of a broken bone, are greatly facilitated by attention to the general position of the limb. In some particular cases, as in fractures of the olecranon and of the patella, we have it in our power, by stretching out the limb, to relax the whole of the muscles whose operation can tend to displace the fractured parts ; and as a general prin- ciple, whenever a particular position of the limb, relaxing the most powerful of its muscles, can be made to co-operate with the best mechanical contrivance for securing a due approxi- mation of the ends of the fractured bone, this unquestionably is the position which we ought to adopt. But as these two objects are not always attainable at the same time, we must sometimes sacrifice the former to the latter. Simple fractures may generally be looked upon as accidents devoid of much danger, and their treatment should be particu- larly successful amongst soldiers, who have, for the most part, the advantage of immediate and constant medical attendance from the receipt of the injury to the completion of the cure. Many soldiers, however, are invalided in consequence of imper- fect recoveries from fractures of the limbs, a circumstance which has not escaped the notice of the authorities ; and the respon- sibility of a more successful treatment ol these accidents is very properly fixed upon medical officers, by the following paragraph ol a printed circular letter, under the signatures of Sir James M‘Grigor and Sir William Franklin. “ Too much care cannot be taken by medical officers to counter- act the measures adopted by designing individuals to ren- der the recovery of an injury incomplete. The 25th and 51st articles of the Warrant, dated 14th November 1329, relative to the discharging of soldiers, confer a power on me- dical officers, adequate, it is hoped, to deter men from pro- tracting their recovery, or from rendering the cure of an injury

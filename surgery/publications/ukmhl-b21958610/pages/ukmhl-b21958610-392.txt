MILITARY SURGERY. 372 under the best treatment, the cure of compound fractures is necessarily a tedious process, and hence blood-letting should be used with great, perhaps with more than usual cau- tion. In gunshot fracture, when this occurs towards the middle of a bone, and when the comminution is not great, the soft parts not much contused, and the patient likely to be speedily placed in circumstances favourable to his recovery, an attempt may be made to save the limb ; and after having extracted the ball or other extraneous substances which may havelodgedin the wound, and having also removed any detached splinters of bone or projecting spiculae, the wound is to be co- vered with a pledget of lint, placed in a position calculated to relax as far as possible the injured muscles, and if the patient is to be moved, it should be surrounded with splints and a many-headed roller, more however with a view of securing him from any additional violence to his limb during the trans- portation to the car than with any view to its speedy reunion. Whenever a ball has become imbedded in the substance of a bone, no effort should be spared to effect its removal. Mr. Guthrie’s extensive experience has led him to express himself very strongly on this point, and Sir Charles Bell’s account of the sufferings of the Russian General Baron Driesen, will afford a striking example of the miseries often entailed upon patients by balls lodged in bones. A case in which I was consulted about three years ago, affords if possible a still stronger proof of the extent and duration of suffering from this cause. An officer wounded so long back as April 1813, had retained from that time a musket ball in the upper part of the i tibia, a source of almost continued distress and repeated fe- brile attacks, by which his constitution was so much impaired, that although the extraction of the ball was successfully ac- complished, the fever supervening upon the operation assumed a typhoid character and carried him off rapidly.

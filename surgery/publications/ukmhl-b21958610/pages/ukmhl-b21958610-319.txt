"WOUNDS OF THK HEAD. 299 are most frequently followed by this kind of mischief, which goes on to the formation of matter within the skull. The obvious indications in the early stages of such cases are, the employment of blood-letting and other antiphlogistic measures, with a view to repress the inflammation and obviate suppura- tion. When this suppuration is limited in quantity, and concentrated round the seat of the injury, relief is occasionally given by the use of the trepan, but it much more frequently happens that the matter formed by this secondary inflamma- tion, is diffused extensively over the surface of the brain or its membranes, and is not to be evacuated by a perforation. Others have no doubt been more fortunate, but it so happens that I have never seen a drop of matter evacuated, nor the smallest relief given by the use of the trepan in such cases. The three kinds of compression which I have now specified from depressed bone, from blood, and from matter, comprise all those commonly arising from the accidents which occur in civil life, and may all take place without any wound in the scalp; but in addition to this, we have to consider, with reference to military practice, the consequences of wounds penetrating the brain, and of foreign bodies lodging within the cranium. Wounds penetrating the brain or its membranes, although not necessarily fatal, must ever be looked upon as cases of the most hazardous description. The symptoms of such wounds, although various, anomalous, and sometimes inexplicable, are to be considered chiefly as of an inflammatory character, and have been already specified. With regard to the treatment, in addition to what has already been said, I would more par- ticularly urge the necessity of being constantly alive to every occasional or periodical aggravation of the symptoms, and the propriety of meeting this by repeated local depletion, by bleed- ing from the temples, or the application of leeches contiguous to the wound. The utility of cold applications in idiopathic inflammations of the brain and its membranes, is established

The opinion that peculiar forms of eruption succeed peculiar descriptions of primary sore, is not supported by the general testimony of surgeons, and, indeed, it must be admitted, that the same primary ulcer is sometimes succeeded in the same patient by eruptions of several differ- ent sorts either existing together on various parts of the body, or breaking out in succession. Dr. Hennen assures us, that he has frequently observed eruptions of the same nature and character to succeed to the foul indurated excavated ulcer, and to the simple excoriation. In fifteen cases of eruptions, unaccompanied with any other symptoms, which succeeded the Hunterian sore, six were tubercular, five exanthematous, two pustular, one tubercular and scaly, and one tubercular and vesicular. In twelve cases following the non-Hunterian sore, and in which eruptions were the only symptoms, six were pustular, three were exanthematous, two were tubercular, and one was tubercular and scaly. These statements are sufficient to shew the uncertainty of the oc- currence of any particular form of eruption, after any given appearance of the primary sore, and this is still farther con- firmed by the following general inference stated by Sir J M‘Grigor and Sir W. Franklin, as the result of the reports transmitted to them by the great body of the army surgeons 111 reP1y t0 certain Tories proposed with a view to the estab’ hshment of several important points in the treatment of the venereal disease.-- 1.

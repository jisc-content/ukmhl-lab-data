WOUNDS. 197 -rectioii of the muscular fibres. If these fibres are penetrated .'obliquely, the retraction is greater ; and if the fibres are , ^divided transversely, the separation of the lips of the wound i is still farther increased. The prognosis, in cases of incised .'wounds, although, as a general rule, it may be considered rmore favourable than in any other description of wounds of :the same extent, is yet modified by many contingent circum- ' stances. Deep wounds are more dangerous and difficult of cure than superficial wounds of even a greater extent; and the danger of wounds is greatly increased by various compli- cations, such as the division of large blood-vessels, giving rise to profuse hemorrhage ; the lesion of nerves, tendons, and aponeuroses, giving rise to spasms and convulsions; the di- vision of excretory ducts, and nutritious canals leading to the , effusion of various fluids ; and the opening of the great ca- wities, making room for the protrusion of the different vis- eeera. Although the gigantic blows, by which bodies are dismem- i.bercd, and limbs severed from the trunk, are but a rare oc- ccurrence in modern warfare, yet very severe and dangerous I\ wounds are often inflicted by the sabre ; and it is about the \ Ihead, the neck, the shoulders, and upper part of the trunk, t that these wounds are chiefly to be met with. By such wounds, extensive portions of the cranium are occasionally detached along with the scalp, and in such cases reunion - sometimes takes place in a manner that could scarcely be ex- ] pected; indeed it is not by the injury of bones that sabre i wounds are most destructive ; but by means of the sabre, joints are occasionally laid open, their appendages destroyed, the tendons divided, and such extensive mischief occasioned, as to endanger the loss of a limb, and, very frequently, to bring the patientâ€™s life into hazard. From our being able in general to ascertain at once the extent of the injury, our I ] prognosis in sabre. wounds becomes less doubtful, and the

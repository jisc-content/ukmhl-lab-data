MILITARY SURGERY. 294 slight cases disappear without any surgical aid. There arc some extreme cases in which the use of stimulants, wine, or brandy and water, administered in small quantities, may be necessary to renovate the sinking powers; these, however, are to be used with a sparing hand, and to be withheld the mo- ment that the immediate danger from collapse is over, and symptoms of reaction commence. In proportion as the im- mediate stupefaction consequent upon the injury subsides, the pulse rises, the respiration becomes more perceptible, some- times laborious, the heat of the limbs returns, the pupils con- tract, the patient evinces an unusual degree of impatience of temper, is averse to answer questions, or answers them in a hurried manner; he becomes restless, is deprived of sleep, and complete delirium often supervenes, denoting an inflammatory state of the brain, or its membranes. This is what every concussion, not immediately fatal, is liable to terminate in ; this is what should induce us to be very guarded in the use of stimulants in the first instance, from a fear of aggravating the subsequent inflammation, and this it is which calls for the abstraction of blood,—the exhibition of purgatives,—of anti- monial sudorifics,—the exclusion of light from the patient’s chamber,—perfect rest and the most rigid abstinence. The employment of bloodletting in concussion of the brain, requires much discrimination. In cases where the concussion is so severe as to produce any organic lesion of the brain, or (to lacerate any of its tender vessels, bleeding may in the first instance obviate internal hemorrhage, and subsequently pre- vents the excess of inflammatory action ; on the other hand, if too early employed, as is sometimes the case, it may con. vert a temporary into a fatal collapse, and if unduly persevered in, it may suspend the salutary action of the capillary vessels upon which the repair of the injury depends. In young and vigorous subjects, it will readily be understood, that bleeding, p all points of view, is more admissible than in old soldiers

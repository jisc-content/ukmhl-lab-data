141 BURNS. The inflammatory action succeeding to burns is the chief < object of attention in conducting their medical treatment, . and hence their consideration appears to me to he nppro- jpriately introduced as a sequel to the subject of inflamma- * tion. T. he accidents of this kind to which I would more par- ticularly advert, as incident to soldiers and seamen, occur perhaps less frequently from the fire of an enemy, than from accidental explosions of gunpowder, originating often from ignorance or inattention. The bursting of fire-anus, i the explosion of cartridge-boxes, the blowing up of tumbrils, i magazines, and batteries, are amongst the most common sources of burning in military life, and in such cases the burns : are frequently accompanied with lacerated and contused wounds so formidable as to render the burn a secondary < object. ^ o give some idea of the nature of such accidents, I may i refer to a case detailed in Trotter’s Medicina Nautica, of a seaman belonging to the Circe, who, by the explosion of a gun in the act of reloading, was blown into the main chains, and was there found with his face, head, and breast, scorched m the most shocking manner, part of both arms carried away, and the right arm fractured near the axilla—notwithstanding which, this individual was saved.

More than a hundred of our men were in the for- tifications at the moment when the mines wrere sprung; they were raised along with the debris of the batteries, and the

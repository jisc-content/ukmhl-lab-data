MILITARY SURGERY. 364* mperfect. In civil life, persons commonly recover from the effect of fractures and dislocations of bones, and there is no good reason why soldiers should not be equally fortu- nate.‚Äù When any considerable displacement of the fractured ex- tremities of a bone exists, it must prove a source of continued irritation, and where the nature of the accident is distinctly seen, the fracture should be immediately reduced. We know, however, that in as far as regards the formation of callus, and the ultimate reunion of the bone, particularly in gunshot frac- tures, the cure will not be retarded by the want of immediate coaptation ; and where the swelling has rendered the nature of an accident obscure, we may run the risk of aggravating the injury by violent or unguarded attempts at reduction. It does not fall within my province to consider successively and minutely the fractures of each individual bone; but I may remark, that when fractures occur near the junction of the limbs with the trunk of the body, much difficulty is experi- enced in their management, from our not being able to confine the upper fragments. Here, generally speaking, the diagnosis is most difficult and the treatment least satisfactory. Fracture of the clavicle is an accident very common in mi- litary as in civil life; its diagnosis is not difficult, and its treatment on the principles so well explained by Desault, should be amply successful. But we find many instances of soldiers whose clavicles have been broken, and carelessly treated, constantly complaining that they are incommoded by their belts, or by the straps of their knapsacks pressing upon the prominent part of the bone, and this even to such a de- gree, as to be thought a ground for soliciting their discharge. Cases of this kind will never cease to be a source of vexation to a surgeon when lie has to blame himself for any negligence in their treatment, which it is well known may be successfully conducted by placing a cushion in the axilla, raising the shoul-

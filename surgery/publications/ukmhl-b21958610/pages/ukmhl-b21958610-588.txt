568 MILITARY SURGERY. There is little clanger of our neglecting or overlooking those acute cases of the disease which are attended with severe pain in the region of the liver, impeded respiration, quick andbard pulse, with the other symptoms enumerated by nosologists as charac- teristic of hepatitis. It is, therefore, more my present object to direct attention to some of those symptoms characteristic of those milder or more chronic forms of the disease, where pam is not urgent, and where we want this guide to direct us to the seat of the evil.

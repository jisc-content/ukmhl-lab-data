If it should strike any part of the body when the velocity with which the ball is passing is great- ly diminished, it does not cany it away, as in the preceding ease, but, in consequence of its curvilinear or rolling motion, it turns round the part in the same manner as a wheel passes over a limb, instead of forcing a passage through it. The soft elastic parts, such as the skin and cellular membrane, yield, while the bones, muscles, tendons, arteries, &c., offering a greater degree of resistance, are either bruised or ruptured; if the ball should strike one of the cavities of the body,-the viscera suffer in like manner.1’ But, to advert to the more obvious and more frequent con- sequences of gunshot wounds.—These injuries are so various in degree, and so different in texture and in function are the parts upon which they happen to be inflicted, that no train of symptoms can be enumerated as applicable to all cases of gun- shot wounds. The simple passage of a musket bullet through the arm or thigh of a healthy subject, when it docs not injure the bone or wound any important arterial, venous, or nervous trunk, is not in general attended with any urgent or alarm- ing symptoms ; the pain attending it is frequently found to attract little of the patient’s attention ; and he is only induced to notice it in consequence of more or less impediment to the motion of the limb, with a sense of numbness rather than of pain, and some degree of tremor. No haemorrhage of any con- sequence occurs from such a wound, and on the part being more particularly examined, we observe a circular hole, with its edges somewhat inverted and generally blackened,. mark- in cr the entrance of the ball; and when the ball has passed out, we find an opening more irregular in shape, larger, free from blackness or discolouration, and with its edges rather everted. If the ball in its passage has cut across or lacerated an important arterial trunk, there is haemorrhage superadded;

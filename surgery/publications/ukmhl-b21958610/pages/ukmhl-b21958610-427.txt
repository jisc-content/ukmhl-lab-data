407 AMPUTATION. operation is delayed the greater will be the chance of suc- cess. This question of immediate or delayed amputation was discussed in memoirs submitted to the French Academy by Bourdenaave and Bagieii; both of whom advocate opinions similar to those of Boucher, and contrary to those of Faure, who recommended delay. Bourdenaave, in speaking of the cases requiring this operation, admits that it may often become necessary in military practice, when in similar cases occurring in civil life it might be dispensed with. The ne- cessity of moving the sick from place to place, and the in- juries which this movement, in cases of fractured limbs, often superadds to the original mischief, are the circumstances upon which he founds this very accurate opinion. Soon after these discussions in the Academy of Surgery in France, Bilguer, Surgeon-General to the Prussian army, published opinions on the subject of amputation, so singular, supported with so much confidence, and enforced by such an extent of practice, that his memoir on the subject attracted very general notice, and its celebrity was perhaps enhanced by a shew of humanity, which, whether specious or real, is well calculated to ex- cite public sympathy. Such language as Bilguer adopts will always have its effect until due reflection shews its absurdity. “ To cut off a limb,” says he, “ after a bad wound, what is it but to add wound to wound, to heap new pains upon a dis- ordered system ?” The frequent failure of this operation in the Prussian service previous to the time of Bilguer’s appointment as Surgeon-Ge- neral, seems to have made an indelible impression upon his mind of its inutility, and so soon as he acquired the power, he lost no time in enforcing his opinion of its impropriety. A general order was issued forbidding its performance in any case, and at the conclusion of the war we find Bilguer boasting, that amidst upwards of six thousand wounded, the Prussian sur-

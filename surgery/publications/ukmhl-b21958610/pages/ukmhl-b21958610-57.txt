DIET, CLOTHING, AND EXERCISE OF TROOPS. 37 valuable information for which the most experienced will be ready to offer their acknowledgments to the author. On many of the points thus cursorily noticed, a medical of- ficer may be greatly assisted in forming an accurate judgment by an attentive study of the French “ Code de la Conscrip- tion,” of which an abstract is to be found in the sixth volume of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. There is also a “ Memoire sur le Choix des Hommes Propres au Service Mili- taire,” published by Beaupre, an article on the “ Simulation des Maladies,” in the “ Dictionnaire des Sciences Medicales,” by Baron Percy, and some observations on this subject in the “ Hygiene Militaire” of Revolat, well deserving attention. The many attempts made to evade the operation of the con- scriptive laws in France during the revolutionary war, induced the authorities to frame and enact a set of regulations for the guidance of those concerned in examining conscripts, embrac- ing almost every point on which a doubt or difference of opi- nion can exist.

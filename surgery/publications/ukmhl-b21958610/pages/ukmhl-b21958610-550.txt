MILITARY SURGERY. 530 average annual mortality for a period of twelve years, was up- wards ofl 2 per cent., anil from a table inserted in Boling- brokeâ€™s description of the settlement of Demerara, it appears that the annual number of deaths in the British army serving in the West Indies, from 1796 to 1802 inclusive, was upon an average 21 per cent. ; and in the year 1797 it amounted to upwards of 32 per cent. But before proceeding farther with the consideration of tropical diseases, it may be well to give a view of the extern and general distribution of our forces. The British army, in- dependently of the ordnance department, during peace, usu- ally consists of about 110,000 men. Of these, 26,000 are distributed in Great Britain. A similar number is employed in Ireland, 20,000 in India, and 38,000 in other foreign stations. Forty-four regiments of Europeans, besides native and colonial corps, are commonly employed in intertropical stations. Of these, four regiments of cavalry, and twenty of infantry, are stationed in the East Indies, four regiments of infantry in Ceylon, and three in the Mauritius, eight in the Windward and Leeward Islands, and five in Jamaica. The artillery and European corps belonging to the East India Company amount to about ten thousand men. The usual ratio of mortality among troops employed in the United Kingdom, is about 1.5 per cent. ; in the army generally, it is about 3.5, while among the troops on foreign service, it com- monly amounts to 5.7 per cent. As the mortality among troops employed abroad is about four times greater than that among troops on home service, a corresponding degree of care ought to be taken to preserve the health of soldiers on foreign service, and thereby to diminish the rate of mortality. Among the various means which may be employed to prevent disease among troops on foreign stations, none is of more importance than the selection of that period of the year for their disembarkation which is most con-

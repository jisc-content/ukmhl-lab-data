201 INCISED WOUNDS. on the subject of adhesion or union by the first intention* t there is no important difference amongst practical surgeons as tto the most effectual means of promoting it; and there is no i difference amongst the surgeons of this country as to the pro- priety of attempting the cure of almost all wounds by approx- iimating their lips, and thereby promoting adhesion. This pro- perty in living parts of inosculating and uniting again, is in- pdeed so perfect, that in certain cases we may depend upon it ’ with confidence ; and it is thus that in wounds we save i much pain, prevent a large suppuration, a great waste of ] parts, and limit the scar to a narrow and almost invisible line, — these “ will be allowed to be improvements while human : nature shall remain sensible of pain, while scars shall be thought deformities, or confinement be deemed irksome.” In those incised wounds to which the soldier and sailor are more particularly exposed, the sabre or cutlass inflicting the wound is withdrawn by the hand which guided it; and our only object, after staying the haunorrhage, is to bring the re- cently divided surfaces into accurate contact, and to retain them in this position so as to favour reunion. Even when a perfect approximation of the opposite surfaces cannot be ef- fected, it still becomes an object to bring them as nearly in contact as circumstances will admit. This diminishes the extent of the effort which nature is called upon to make for the repair of the injury, and proportionally lessens the consti- tutional irritation ; it makes a more seemly, a less extensive, and, above all, a firmer cicatrix; it greatly accelerates the cure, and, of course, diminishes the time during which the patient is confined to hospital. This is a consideration of the very utmost importance, particularly after ev.ery great action, when the hospitals are necessarily crowded with wounded,— when hospital gangrene is liable to occur,—when the consti- tution of every individual must suffer more or less by confine- ment, his convalescence be rendered proportionally more tc-

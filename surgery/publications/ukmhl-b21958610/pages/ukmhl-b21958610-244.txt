Each of these makes of course a correspondent opening, a cir- cumstance which it may be of some moment to recollect when balls are lodged between bones, or imbedded in their sub- stance, and when it becomes necessary to effect their removal by instruments. Besides the common musket bullet composed of lead, the various other projectiles which I have just men- tioned are employed in modern European warfare ; and the injuries inflicted by them fall to be considered under the head of gunshot wounds. Shells are large hollow spheres of iron filled with gunpowder, which may act either in their entire form as solid balls, or subsequently, by their explosion and subdivision into numerous splinters, in which state their ra- vages are greatly extended ; and the wounds they occasion are of the most formidable kind. Cannon balls vary in size and weight, from one to thirty-two pounds; the latter being chiefly employed in batteries for the purpose of effecting breaches, and those of smaller dimensions in engagement in the open field. Grape-shot consist of small iron balls contained in canvass bags, to which a circular wooden bottom is attached, with a spindle passing up through the centre of the bag, and round this the balls are disposed, and secured by means of cord or wire, so as to have some distant resemblance to a bunch of grapes. Canister or case-shot consist of the same description of balls contained in cylindrical cases of tin, closed at either extremity with circular pieces of wood ; bpth the latter descrip- tion of missiles are so constructed as to fit the calibre of field pieces from which they arc discharged. Attempts have been made to calculate with precision the force and velocity of these different projectiles, and to specify the number of files through which each of them will penetrate. Thus, Dâ€™Antoni, director of the Military Academy at Turin, calculates, that a 32 pound shot will pierce a file of 70 men

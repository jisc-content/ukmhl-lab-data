WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 36J and shortening of the limb, with eversion of the toes. The space between the trochanter and crest of the ilium is dimi- nished ; on drawing down and rolling the limb, a crepitus is perceptible, and the trochanter may be observed to move along with the shaft of the bone. The attention of the profession has of late been much directed to fractures of the neck of the femur, to the possibility of procuring a bony reunion when the fracture is within the capsular ligament, and to the circum- stances which may favour or counteract such reunion. But without going into this controversy,I may observe, that I have not yet seen any unequivocal instance of a bony reunion where the fracture was wholly within the capsule, and the head of the hone fairly detached, and I am necessarily led to agree with Sir Astley Cooper in questioning the probability of a bony re- union under such circumstances. On the other hand, I am induced, from my own experience, to admit the difficulty of ascertaining precisely whether a fracture of the neck of the fe- mur is wholly or only in part within the capsule; and I con- cur with Mr. Karle in believing, that painful and protracted efforts to ascertain this point may prove not only futile, but ultimately injurious, by lacerating the investing membrane of the neck of the bone, and impeding its reunion ; “ thus con- tributing to make good our opinions by our practice.” In the treatment of this accident, I presume that every sur- geon is desirous of taking steps to procure the most perfect re- union of which the case admits; and I believe that the perfec- tion of this reunion often depends upon circumstances which it is nearly or altogether impossible to ascertain with precision, nay, upon circumstances which may be altered for the worse by the very attempt at such precision. I would therefore recommend in every case to take the chance of obtaining a bony reunion by adopting that mode of treatment most likely to procure it; for, however imperfect this union may ultimately prove, it will always be a pleasant reflection to

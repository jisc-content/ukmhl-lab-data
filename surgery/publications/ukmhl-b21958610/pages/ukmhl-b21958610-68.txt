MILITARY SURGERY. 48 above period, one hundred and four recruits out of four bun- dredand fifty landed in the preceding July, and only fifty-six out of eleven hundred and seventeen old soldiers ; yet no regiments on that service were more ably commanded or better officered, than the Fusileers and 40th regiments. It would be easy to en- large here on the importance of exercise as a branch of mili- tary education, but my remarks must be limited to what is needful towards preserving an army in health ; and without specifying more minutely the exercises or amusements which ought to be encouraged, it may be observed that walking, run- ning, leaping, swimming, wrestling, and fencing, are exer- cises often useful in the actual practice of war. ACCOMMODATION OF TROOPS, IN CAMP, IN BARRACKS, IN BIL- LETS, DISEASES PREVALENT IN CAMPS AND GARRISONS. Of all the circumstances connected with a camp, the most important is its site ; the experience of all ages has proved, that the neighbourhood of marshes, grounds subject to be overflowed by large rivers, surrounded with foul stagnating water, or low places covered with wood, are most injurious to health ; and the noxious effluvia arising from these situations are augmented in proportion to the heat of the climate, or the season of the year; hence such neighbourhoods become more dangerous for encampments in tropical regions, and in our own country during the heats of summer and of autumn. The danger of such situations is also, in some degree, depen- dant upon the temporary or permanent nature of the establish- ment we have in view.

243 WOUNDS OF THE ARTERIES. i trolled bleeding from a large vessel, that surgeons have, in all : ages, looked with anxiety to an efficacious means of restraining I haemorrhage; and the reflection that three-fourths of those kill- (ed in battle are supposed to die from the escape or extravasa- tion of blood, is a circumstance noways calculated to diminish i this anxiety. The various expedients resorted to for arresting ta flow of blood may be looked upon as either of a temporary (or permanent nature; and as operating either indirectly on tthe trunks conveying the fluid to the bleeding point, or di- i rectly on the orifices of the bleeding vessels: As a temporary expedient for the suspension of hemorrhage in wounds and K operations, the tourniquet is an instrument with which every surgeon of the present day is familiar: for the invention of ilthis instrument, as well as for the greatest improvement which i it has ever undergone, we are indebted to two eminent French -surgeons, Morel and Petit. The former was the first to em- ]ploy the tourniquet in a very simple form at the siege of Be- ■ san^on in 1G74. A ligature or broad tape being passed round the limb, a wooden pin was employed to tighten it, in the same way that carters employ what, in Scotland, is termed a rack-stick to tighten the ropes which retain the loads upon j: their waggons. A particular description of this mode of restraining hsemor- i rhage is given by Mr. Young in the Currus Triumphalis, pub- lished in 1768 : “ I hope,” says he, “it will not be altogether d impertinent if I here take occasion to recommend to the young 1 practitioner one way of ligature very useful in amputations, especially above the knee, that is to say, a wadd of hard linen (cloth, or the like, inside the thigh, a little below the inguen ; ■ then passing a towel round the member, knit the ends of it together, and with a baton, a bed-staff or the like, twist it till it compress the wadd or bolster so very strait on the crural vessels, that (the circulation being stopped in them) their bleeding, when divided by the excision, shall be scarce large

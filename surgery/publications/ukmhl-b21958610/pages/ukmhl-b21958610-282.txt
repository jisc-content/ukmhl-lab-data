MILITARY SURGERY. 262 rism is in all cases necessarily preceded by a breach in the internal and middle coats of an artery. This is the opinion of the distinguished Professor Scarpa, who acknowledges a state of preternatural dilatation in the whole circumference of an artery, and mentions the frequency of its occurrence in the ascending aorta ; but at the same time considers this as differing from aneurism, although he admits that the two diseases frequently exist in the same vessel. Of this circum- scribed dilatation, or aneurismal swelling in the course of an artery, examples are occasionally met with on dissection in the course of the thoracic aorta, and I have seen two exam- ples, in the living body, of what I believe to be similar swell- ings at the root of the common carotid ; both of these cases, one of them in the person of a medical man, have remained nearly stationary for years, and do not easily admit of, nor seem to demand, any remedial treatment. The disease termed varicose aneurism, consists in a preternatural dilatation of the branches of an artery, only observable in vessels lying super- ficially, and giving them a resemblance to the disease of the venous system tenned varix. Of this interesting examples arc recorded by Pelletan, Wardrop, Syme, MacLachlan, and others ; but as the varicose aneurism, as well as the aneurism by anastomosis, is always, I believe, congenital, and of course ought to be a reason for excluding any individual affected with it from military service, it is foreign to my purpose to en- large on its nature or treatment. The second description of aneurism is formed by a breach in the coats of an artery, originating in the interior coat, and proceeding outwards. It comprehends the greater number of spontaneous aneurisms, and is described by Scarpa, Hodgson, and others as the true aneurism. Its principal varieties are the circumscribed and diffused ; circumscribed, so long as the external coat remains entire, forming the sac of the tu- mour, and diffused when in the progress of the disease this

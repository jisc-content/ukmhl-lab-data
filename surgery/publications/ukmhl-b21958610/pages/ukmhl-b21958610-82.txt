MILITARY SURGERY. 62 heads covered with their hoods, their ears previously protected by the flaps of their forage-caps ; their feet converging to- wards the fire ; their heads supported by their packs. They should lie close to each other, covered with the rest of the blankets; in wet and cold weather, a half ration of spirits should be issued previous to their retiring to rest. “ In very cold weather, sentries should only be kept on an hour, or even half an hour; and when relieved, the men should not be permitted to lie down immediately by the fires, but be kept pacing round them, till the sensation of numbness is relieved. Under similar circumstances, only one-half of the troops should be allowed to lie down at a time, the other half being kept in motion round the fires, with orders to awake their comrades after two hours’ sleep, that they may rest in their turn. “ When sleeping on the snow-covered ground, the men had better pile up a heap of snow on each side of them ; these banks will afford a comfortable protection. Under these cir- cumstances, incredible comfort will arise from anointing the face and ears with oil before retiring to rest or going upon duty. “ On arriving on the bivouack ground, the sick should be put under canvass, or accommodated in adjoining buildings, each corps assembling its sick in the rear of its centre.” A due attention to the foregoing circumstances in the selec- tion of recruits, the diet, clothing, and exercise of troops, and their accommodation in camp or in quarters, will do much to obviate the occurrence and to check the progress of disease amongst soldiers ; but it has been, perhaps justly, observed, that in all large armies, more men perish by inbred disease than by the sword of the enemy, and that more campaigns have been decided by sickness than by battle ; it is therefore neces- sary that we should be aware of the particular kinds of disease most prevalent in the field and in quarters.

MILITARY SURGERY. 14 “ when I was in the wars at Muttrel, in the time of that most famous prince, King Henry VIII., there was a great rabble- ment there that took upon them to be surgeons. Some were sow-geklers, and horse-gelders, with tinkers and cobblers. This noble sect did such great cures that they got themselves a perpetual name, for like as Thessalus’s sect were called Thes- salians, so was this rabblement, for their notorious cures, call- ed dog-leeches ; for in two dressings they did commonly make their cures whole and sound for ever, so that they neither felt heat nor cold, nor no manner of pain after. But when the Duke of Norfolk, who was then general, understood how the people did die, and that of small wounds, he sent for me and certain other surgeons, commanding us to make search how these men came to their death, whether it were by the griev- ousness of their wounds, or by the lack of knowledge of the surgeons ; and we, according to our commandment, made search through all the camp, and found many of the same good fellows, which took upon them the names of surgeons, not only the names, but the wages also. We asking of them whether they were surgeons or no ; they said they were. We demanded with whom they were brought up : and they, with shameless faces, would answer, either with one cunning man or another who was dead. Then we demanded of them what chirurgery stuff they had to cure men withal: and they would shew us a pot or a box, which they had in a budget, wherein was such trumpery as they did use to grease horses1 heels, and laid upon scabbed horses1 backs; and others that were cobblers and tinkers, they used shoemakers1 wax, with the rust of old pans, and made therewithal a noble salve, as they did term it. But in the end this worthy rabblement was committed to the Marshalsea, and threatened by the Duke’s Grace to be hanged for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth what they were, and of what occupation, and in the end they did confess as I have declared to you before.

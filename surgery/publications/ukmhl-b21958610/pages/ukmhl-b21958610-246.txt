MILITARY SURGERY. 220 of a ball cannot be given, this arises only from the want of sufficient data ; for the causes of many of the peculiarities at- tending gunshot wounds certainly depend upon the laws by which projectiles are governed, and hy which the mechanical effect of a hall is determined. The force, the momentum, and the direction of the shot that is received; the position, variety of structure, and powers of resistance in the part receiving it, must always he considered, in order to account for the effects it produces. As a general law, it may he observed, that a body in motion striking against any substance loses a part of its momentum, which is communicated to the substance against which it strikes. If a body in motion meets with a direct resistance equal to itsmomentum, the motion will be stop- ped ; if this resistance is less than the impetus, the motion will be continued at a diminished rate ; and should the resistance act laterally on a body in motion, it will alter its course, and the moving body will fly off’ from the point at which it meets the resistance, in a line forming an angle with the line of its original direction. This last proposition, which is important to our present purpose, may he more generally stated thus, as may he seen in various works upon mechanical philosophy i “ A body acted on at once by the impulse of two powers, will not move in the direction of either, but in the diagonal of a parallelogram, of which two sides are fonned by the direction given by each of these powers respectively ; and every change of impulse or resistance w ill cause the body to assume so many changes of direction, till at length its momentum is overcome, and it becomes quiescent.” The resistance from the soft parts may be considered as the continued application of a power, the uniform and equable oper- ation of which causes the motion of a hall to be curvilinear, and ultimately brings it to rest; as is explained by writers on pro- jectiles. And in illustration of these propositions a diagram is given in Chevalier’s Essay on Gunshot Wounds, and also i»

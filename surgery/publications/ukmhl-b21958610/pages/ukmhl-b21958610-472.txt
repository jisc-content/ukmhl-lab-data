MILITARY SUROERY. 452 iris, which terminate in suppuration, ami as the matter they contain falls into the anterior chamber, hypopion is produced. The occurrence of iritis is fraught with so much danger to the organ of vision, that we cannot be too early or too assiduous in our endeavours to obviate the disorgani- zation of the eye in which it is so apt to terminate. This is most likely to be accomplished by local depletion, either by opening the temporal artery or by cupping, combined with the internal use of calomel and hyosciamus or opium, which in this instance is observed to operate more like a specific than in any other case; and it is one of the singu- lar and apparently contradictory circumstances attending this affection, that whether it occurs without any obvious consti- tutional taint, whether it occurs as a secondary symptom of syphilis under the non-mercurial practice, or whether it oc- curs in connexion with a mercurialized state of the system, the employment of mercury is for the most part attended with the same good effects. In the last case it proves, as Mr. Travers has observed, both the bane and antidote, tending to check the effusion of lymph and to promote its absorption. For this purpose it has been recommended locally ; the blue ointment combined with opium, extract of hyosciamus, bel- ladonna, or stramonium, to be rubbed morning and evening into the eyelids and temple. It is, however, the combination of calomel with opium given internally, general and local bleeding, warm bath, purgatives and antimonials, with the application of extract of belladonna round the eyelids, to which I have been accustomed to trust in the treatment of this af- fection, and my success in numerous instances induces me to recommend such treatment with confidence. One of the most serious consequences of inflammation of the iris is complete closure of the pupil, an affection only to be remedied by an operation ; and as I have avoided going

MILITARY SURGERY. 101 or other narrow passes, anil the difficulty with which these unwieldy conveyances are removed, he observes, “ The addi- tion of one spare horse to a cart doubles the power to get over any road particularly bad ; but in the case of waggons, even the adding of four horses, where it is practicable, to those usually allotted, increases but little the power, from the unwieldiness of so numerous a team, and the difficulty of making so many horses draw together. Again, over rocks or any occasional impediment, where the strength of a few men would be lost on a waggon and its lading, the same means applied to carts would surmount the obstruction with ease.-” “ When one horse, in a set of four, fails in strength from sickness or any other cause, the consequences extend to the other three horses of the team, inasmuch as increased exertion is required from them to make up for the defective horse. The tendency of this is to knock up them also; and a whole team, together with the waggon, has frequently been destroy- ed from the failure of one horse.” These inconveniences arising from the failure of a team of horses belonging to a waggon are also sometimes experienced from the failure of the men employed to drive them, of which, amongst other instances, one rather ludicrous than serious occurred to myself in France. When about to march off one morning from the village wrhere wre had halted during the night, the hospital sergeant came up to me in great distress to say, that the sick could not be moved ; that one of the waggon-drivers had deserted during the night, leaving one of his horses without shoes, and that the other driver was, as he termed it, a sort of an idiot. Upon inquiiy I found that the hospital cook, a Yorkshire man, amongst his other ac- quirements, knew something of the management of horses; he wras immediately put in requisition as a wraggoner, had the horse shod by the village blacksmith, and got the waggon under weigh amidst the jokes ol his comrades.

TETANUS. 2H1 that 1 cannot but look upon the pulse as affording us very little assistance in forming a prognosis. The violence, ex- tent, and duration of the spasms,—the sudden accession of the disease,—and the rapidity ofits increase, are the circumstances which should lead us to an unfavourable prognosis; while, its more gradual approach,—the spasms being more circum- scribed and confined to fewer muscles,—the remissions more frequent and of longer continuance,—the patient enjoying sound sleep,—the cutaneous, the focal, and urinary secre- tions continuing natural, or obedient to the powers of medicine, are the circumstances which, in a few, a very few cases, forebode a favourable termination. Although tetanus has been considered as more peculiarly incident to punctured wounds in tendinous parts, yet it oc- casionally supervenes upon every variety of wound, from the most slight and simple, to the most severe and complicated ; in every kind ox texture, and in some cases even where the injury has been so slight as to pass unnoticed. Four re- maikablc cases, three of them fatal, have lately been men- tioned to me, by an experienced army surgeon ; in two of these tetanus supervened on superficial abrasions scarcely pene- trating beyond the cuticle, in a third, on a slight scratch from a razor in shaving, and in the fourth upon the wound made in tapping a hydrocele. There is unfortunately no- thing generally remarkable in the state and progress of wounds, which can lead the most attentive observer to anticipate the attack of the disease, and its invasion occurs also at periods very uncertain. In Rees’s Cyclopaedia a case is recorded, on the authority of the late Professor Robison of this University, in which a negro who had scratched his thumb with a broken china plate, died of tetanus in a quarter of an hour after this slight injury ; but the more usual period of its attack is from to the twentieth day. Sir J. M‘Grigor, in his paper upon the health of the Peninsular army, states, as the general result

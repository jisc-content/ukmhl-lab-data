AMPUTATION. 403 we should sometimes have to regret the precipitate perform- ance of unavailing operations. I am led to say this from the recollection of two remarkable cases, one of which occurred during my apprenticeship, and the other a few years ago. In these cases the patients had sustained such injuries in their limbs as to be deemed fit subjects for amputation, while no suspicion existed of internal injury. In the first case the patient, who was injured by an explosion in a quarry, was lying in a state of collapse, which was expected to be tran- sient, and, in the hope that it would pass off, I was sent away for instruments to amputate the limb, but on my return found that my master had changed his mind, and had begun very shrewdly to suspect, from the man not rally- ing, that he was hurt internally, which proved to be the case, and he died in the course of the ensuing night. In the other case the patient had thrown himself from a window, and I was prevented from amputating the manâ€™s limb by the opposition of his relatives, he being himself in a state of maniacal excitement. Upon calling a few hours afterwards to see if they had altered their minds, I found my patient in a state of collapse, sinking with symptoms of internal haemorrhage, and upon more minute examination I felt an obscure crepitus indicating fracture of the pelvis. This last case leads me to observe, that the state of excitement under which a man receives a wound or un- dergoes a severe surgical operation, does not instantly sub- side after the receipt of the one or the termination of the other, and that sometimes the constitutional shock does not supervene till some distance of time. This has even been suggested to me as a possible explanation of the differ- ence of opinion between some naval and military surgeons upon the point of delay ; it has been suggested that within the limits of a ship, the wounded are necessarily so near the surgeon that they may always be seen by him before the col-

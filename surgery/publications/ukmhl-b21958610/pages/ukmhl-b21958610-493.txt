SYPHILIS. 473 purative process has been long protracted, and the integu- ments much thinned, caustic is the preferable means of making an opening. In speaking of the diagnosis between venereal buboes and scrofulous swellings of the glands/ I pointed out the torpid and indolent nature of the latter as their chief characteristic ; and in practice we must be prepared to meet with tumours of a mixed nature, evidently originating from a venereal infec- tion, while in their progress they seem more akin to the scro- fulous bubo; remaining for days, and sometimes for weeks, quite stationary, without showing a decided tendency either to resolution or suppuration. This is a most tantalizing occur- rence, particularly in private practice, but I am happy to think, that we possess a remedy which will, in a majority of such instances, procure the discussion of the swellings, and in all of them will certainly expedite their termination either in resolution or in suppuration,—blisters to the surface. After having long employed this remedy, and often urged it upon the attention of my medical friends, I was very happy to find my views of its efficacy confirmed by the following recommen- dation of it by a gentleman of Mr. Carmichael’s talents and experience. “ The buboes in this form of venereal disease are often remarkably hard and indolent, evincing neither a ten- dency to disperse nor to suppurate. In such cases the greatest advantage may be derived from the repeated application of blisters to the indurated bubo, which soon either cause the dispersion or the suppuration of the tumour, and thus free the patient from a troublesome symptom which might otherwise continue many months to torment him.” I he symptoms which usually mark the more advanced stages of the venereal disease, or what are denominated se- condary symptoms,—arc, ulcerations of the throat, eruptions on the skin, and nodes, or caries of the bones. These, when they occur in the same individual, appear frequently, but by no

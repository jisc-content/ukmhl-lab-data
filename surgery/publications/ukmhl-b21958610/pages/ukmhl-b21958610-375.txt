WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 3 55 cases, however, where an opportunity is afforded of tying a bleeding artery, it becomes our immediate and indispensable duty to do so, whatever 'may be its size. The possibility of the limb being nourished by the anastomosing branches, even when the largest arteries are tied, is now too well established to render it necessary for me to recur to this subject, or to recapitulate those observations and arguments, by which Mr. J. Bell has so triumphantly rebutted the aphorism of Gooch and his predecessors already quoted. Another injury from extensive sabre wounds, is the divi- sion of the principal nerves of a limb, and from this circum- stance the nutrition and perfect functions of the member are more endangered than from the division of the principal artery. Wasting and paralysis more or less complete, arc in- deed common occurrences from the division of the nerves of an extremity ; but the division of such nerves calls for no surgical expedient, nor does our art hold out any particular means of obviating these consequences ; at the same time, the cutting across of a principal nerve, is not a reason sufficient for the immediate removal of the limb, and our duty still is to endeavour by every means to procure reunion. We have some remarkable instances of sabre wounds di- viding the bones as well as the soft parts of an extremity, and even in such cases useful limbs have been saved. Of this an interesting case is given by Baron Percy, in the paper for- merly quoted, on the reunion of separated parts ; in which he states, that â€œ at the affair of Arlon, under General Delaage, a person named Thiery received a blow from a sabre in the right arm, by which the whole substance of the arm was di- vided, with the exception of a small portion of the soft parts, m which fortunately were the artery and nerve. A cure was accomplished in three months, when the bone, the flesh, and the skin were found to be firmly united; and although the arm remained long in a feeble state, the patient was ultimate-

MILITARY SURGERY. 304 cases of this description, the fatal cases being for the most part regarded as too much a matter of course to be worthy of pub- lication, while a very different opinion is entertained respecting the cases of recovery.” Itwill readilybe understood, that in the removal of foreign bo- dies lodged within the cranium, the use of the trepan frequently becomes necessary; and although I do not now enter into any details of the operation, but leave the steps of it to be shewn upon the dead body in presence of the class, yet I may re- mark, that the practice of military surgery has, in some de- gree, extended the use of this instrument, and shown its ap- plication to parts of the skull formerly considered dangerous or inaccessible.

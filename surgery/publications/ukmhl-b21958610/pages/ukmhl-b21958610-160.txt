He then told me, that his fa- ther had long been a martyr to rheumatism, and that many of his family had also suffered from it, circumstances which induced him to conceive that he inherited a peculiarity of con- stitution. Such occurrences shew how little wre can judge, a priori, of the benefits likely to accrue from the employment of any given remedy in any given case ; and while the impossibility of being more precise upon this point is much to be regret- cd, the feelings of the patient should always be consulted; “ for if the pain be materially alleviated by this or by that ap- plication, its employment will hardly ever be wrong.” The only remaining topic connected with the treatment of inflammation to which I think it necessary to advert, is the nature of the diet and regimen ; and, upon this point no dif- ference of opinion exists. Every scientific surgeon admits, that in acute inflammation, while a cure by resolution is practica- ble, and while this is the object of our treatment, the patient’s diet can scarcely be too abstemious ; his abstinence from vin- ous, or spirituous liquors, cannot be too rigid ; the body, and particularly the affected part, cannot be kept too much at rest, nor the mind too tranquil.

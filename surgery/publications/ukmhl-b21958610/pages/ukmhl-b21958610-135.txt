115 INFLAMMATION. ence of the digestive organs in modifying the phenomena of disease, I am still inclined to give much weight to the follow- ing judicious observations, relative to the vascular system, or to the blood itself, which are contained in an excellent essay on inflammation, by Mr. James of the Exeter Infirma- ry. “ An impure state of the blood exists perhaps more fre- quently than we are aware of; but as it is invariably connect- ed with disorder of the disgestive organs, the effects which partly arise from both causes, are often exclusively attributed to one. But when I see persons in whom every scratch festers into a sore, as in scurvy or scrofula ; when I observe that the atmosphere alone will change the disposition of every action, that poisons introduced, and acting upon the circulating me- dium will induce the most powerful effects upon the whole system,—I must profess myself to be a humoralist in a consi- derable degree, although quite ready to recognise the direct as well as the indirect influence of the digestive organs and nervous system in disease.” Upon the immediate influence of the nervous system in modifying the process of inflammation, I have but little to observe. Amongst soldiers, the class of individuals to whom my observations chiefly refer, we may in general expect these nervous dispositions to exercise a less extensive influence over the process of inflammation and other morbid phenomena than is to be observed in the promiscuous range of private practice ; the nervous system is in some persons extremely ir- ritable, and this irritability, while it is generally the result of disordered health, again becomes a cause of disorder in its turn ; indeed, it may be observed of all the three systems to which I have just adverted, the alimentary, the vascular, and the nervous, that they mutually act and re-act on each other, in such a manner as to render it often exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to specify the extent to which each

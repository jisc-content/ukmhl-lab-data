MILITARY SUROERY. 24-2 be considered hereafter. Of late we have got rid of much of the mystery formerly attached to the nature of gunshot wounds; and have acquired more useful lessons, in learning to dispense with idle, inefficient, or injurious practices, than in the employment of any remedy of a specific nature, exclu- sively applicable to these injuries. Neither soldiers nor sur- geons are now apprehensive of any thing poisonous in a leaden ball; nobody now believes in the mysterious efficacy of silk vestments, which were at one time thought to be impenetra- ble by balls ; nor are we now so credulous with regard to the “ wind of a shot.” In the treatment of gunshot wounds our views are now for the most part bounded by the following simple indications,—the removal of the ball itself, and of any portions of the clothing or accoutrements which may have been carried in with it,—the removal also of detached por- tions of bone,—the securing of wounded blood-vessels,—the moderating the violence, and circumscribing the extent of the consequent inflammation by means of cold applications, leeching, or general bloodletting. WOUNDS OF THE ARTERIES AND ANEURISM. In treating of the different kinds of wounds we have had repeated occasion to advert to the occurrence of haemor- rhage from the division of blood-vessels ; and before proceeding to consider the wounds of particular regions and organs, it is necessary to offer a few remarks on the wounds and diseases of the arterial and nervous systems which are universally distri- buted throughout the body, and the wounds of which are a sub- ject of infinite importance in the practice of military surgery. The loss of life is so natural a consequence of uncon-

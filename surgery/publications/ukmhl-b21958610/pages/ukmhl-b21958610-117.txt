TRANSPORTATION OF SICK AND WOUNDED. 97 s simple, efficient, and practicable contrivances for the convey- ance of the wounded which has yet been devised. A bearer somewhat akin to this was proposed by the late l Colonel Crighton of this place, which is figured in the first • volume of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, and one of which is deposited in the Royal Infirmary, where it i may be seen by the pupils of the house. It consists of a a piece of frame-work, borne, like the former, upon two poles, supporting a tilted cover, and having a small cot or hung bed suspended from it, in which the patient is placed. I have upon two or three occasions employed this litter in conveying patients to or from the Infirmary, and have rea- son to consider it a very comfortable conveyance. It is, how- c ever, obviously the production of a man who had the Edin- burgh chairmen in his eye as bearers, and from its cum- brous and unwieldy form it is quite unfit for the service of the field. The only other conveyance of this kind I shall notice, is that which is very generally used in the Indian army, the Dooly. This varies somewhat in its form in different parts of the country ; in some cases it consists simply of a cot, or rather hammock, suspended from a bamboo, and screened by an awning from the sun, when it obtains the name of a Mancheel. In other cases it consists of a more finished piece of frame-work, covered by painted canvass, so as to protect the patient from the weather, and calculated to let him lie at length within it. A model of the Dooly used in the Madras army is always shown to the pupils of my class ; this dooly is suspended by a pole or bamboo passing through it, and is borne on the shoulders of four men.—Nothing can well be conceived more perfectly adapted to the conveyance of sick than doolies or palaquins, but the number of bearers required for them renders it impossible to bring them into general use in the armies of Europe.

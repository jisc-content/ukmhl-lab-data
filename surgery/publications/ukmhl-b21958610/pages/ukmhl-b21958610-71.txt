ACCOMMODATION OF TROOPS. 51 Notwithstanding every precaution, filth is apt to accumu- late in camp, and consequently stationary camps for the most part soon become unhealthy. In such circumstances, it is con- sonant to all experience, that the most effectual step has always been a change of ground; a measure distinctly recommended by Vegetius—“ Si autumnali festivoque tempore diutius in iis- dem locis militum multitudo consistat, ex contagione aqua- rum et odore ipsius foeditatis vitiatis haustibus et aere corrupto pemiciosissimus nascitur morbus, £ qui proliiberi non potest aliter nisi frequenli mutatione castrorum.’ ” Whenever, therefore, a camp becomes offensive or unwholesome, from the accumulation of filth, instead of trifling or inefficient attempts to remove the nuisance from the camp, the proper re- medy is to remove the camp from the nuisance, and, if possible, to takeup aposition towindwardof the ground formerly occupied. For the accommodation of the sick in camp, the general regu- lations enjoin the propriety of obtaining, if possible, an ad- joining house for their reception; and where this cannot be procured, every exertion is to be used to render the hospital- tent dry and comfortable ; a trench should always be made round it, and the floor boarded with deals, when these can be procured. While the foregoing considerations demand serious atten- tion in judging of the site of camps, similar views will natur- ally influence our decision in recommending a site for the erection of barracks; but here every consideration naturally becomes more important in proportion to the expense, the du- rability, and the permanence of the establishment. Barracks well situated, well ventilated, and kept thoroughly clean, are eminently calculated to promote the health of troops ; and in no other situation do we find soldiers, in general, so exempt from disease, while at the same time their concentration in these establishments facilitates their training, and effectually sub- jects them to the wholesome surveillance of their officers.

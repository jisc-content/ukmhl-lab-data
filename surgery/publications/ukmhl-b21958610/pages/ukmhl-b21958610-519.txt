This gentleman, who is a strenuous advocate for injections, says, that he took the hint of using them thirty-five years before, from a Mr. Green, a surgeon in Leman Street, Goodmanâ€™s Fields, who was the only man that then used them, and whose practice raised much clamour, and many objections and prejudices against him. Since the above period, injections have been recommended by some practitioners, and reprobated by others in terms the most unmeasured. All unbiassed practitioners however will I think admit, that injections, by coming in contact with the seat of the disease, are more likely to act efficaciously upon it than any other form of remedy.

MILITARY SURGERY. 33G locations, and this circumstance will no doubt be observed to his prejudice whenever he fails in the reduction. In considering more particularly the subject of dislocation, we find that the more varied and extensive the motions of which a joint naturally admits, so is it more liable to luxa- tion. Thus in joints simply admitting of flexion and ex- tension, as the elbow and knee-joints, luxations are less fre- quent than in the joints of the hip, and especially of the shoul- der. Much is added, in some cases, to the security of joints, by a large articular surface and a powerful ligamentous apparatus; of this we have a remarkable example in the knee-joint. But in proportion as this joint is secured from luxation by a com- plex structure, so are its wounds more dangerous and its dis- eases more frequent. As a general rule it may be remarked, that while the surrounding muscles form the principal secu- rity of joints in their sound state, they also form the prin- cipal impediments to reduction in a state of luxation. It is now very generally understood, that lacerations of the capsular ligament sufficient to admit of the displacement of the head of a hone, are equally sufficient to admit of its replacement, and there are few if any cases in which we can consider the smallness of the breach in the capsular ligament to be an obstacle to the reduction of the bone. Hence it is to the resistance offered by a contraction of the surrounding muscles, that we must chiefly ascribe the difficulty in reducing luxations, these muscles drawing the head of the luxated bone as far from its natural receptacle as the connexions of the neighbouring parts will admit. The principal diagnostics in cases of luxation are pain in the region of the joint, inability to perform the usual ro- tation or flexion, an unusual protuberance or an unusual flatness of the affected joint, and in general a remarkable lengthening or shortening of the limb. In some cases, a

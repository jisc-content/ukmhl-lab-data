OPHTHALMIA. 447 brane of the palpebra?, and the application of leeches within the eyelids, arc measures which my own experience does not enable me to recommend. The irritation occasioned by the scarifications, or leech-bites, and the inflammation necessarily established for the cure of the wounds inflicted by them, are more than sufficient to counterbalance the good effects of the small quantity of blood abstracted by this means. Similar ob- jections apply, in some degree, to blisters, particularly in the acute stage of the disease, and in the way in which they are frequently employed, of a very small size, and applied close to the eye; but in the chronic stages, and in some of the se- quela; of ophthalmia, blister issues, on the temples, behind the ears, or on the nape of the neck, are highly beneficial. The effect of long continued nausea and sickness in allay- ing febrile excitement, and checking inordinate vascular ac- tion, is known to every tyro in the profession ; and the pro- duction of this state by artificial means has not been over- looked by oculists. The practice of keeping up incessant vo- miting for several hours, was strenuously urged by Sir Wil- liam Adams ; and while some of his cotemporaries have justly condemned this practice as harsh and unsatisfactory, they ap- pear to me to have scarcely rated the good effects of nauseat- ing antimonials sufficiently high. In slight cases, and in the very incipient stage of the com- plaint, the effect of stimulating or acrid substances, dropped into the eye, is sometimes successful in checking the suppur- ative inflammation, and putting a complete stop to the pro- gress of the disease. The experiment, however, is somewhat hazardous; for if not successful, such applications naturally aggravatc the subsequent attack. Of local applications used in this way, the undiluted liquor plumbi acetatis is perhaps the niost generally useful, and may be employed even in the earliest stage of the disease, without much risk of increasing

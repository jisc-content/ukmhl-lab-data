HOSPITALS. 73 The first traces of field hospitals, or, as they are sometimes ailed, flying hospitals, occur perhaps in the east. At any rate, he Emperors Mauricius and Leo \ I. had along with their rmies certain followers termed deputati, (Aa/5roraro/,) who were distributed among the cavalry, and were obliged to carry off .hose wounded in battle. On this account they had on the left tide of the saddle two stirrups, in order that they might more â€¢asily take up the wounded behind them ; and for every person hus saved they obtained a certain reward. They were obliged dso to carry with them a bottle containing water, for the pur- pose of reviving those who might have fainted through loss if blood. In early times, however, it would seem that the spiritual ather than the bodily wants of warriors were the chief ob- jects of attention ; for although an order was made by the first utouncil of Ratisbon, in 7^2, that every commander of an army should have along with him two bishops, with priests and chaplains, and that every colonel should be attended by a jonfessor, no mention is to be found either of field hospitals >r of army surgeons belonging to the first Christian armies, in the writings of the middle ages. We learn, indeed, from the works of Paracelsus, Thurneyser, and others, that they were present at battles and sieges, but they certainly were not appointed as army surgeons, and served merely as soldiers. The field surgeons who occur as accompanying armies in the beginning of the fifteenth century were destined rather for the use of the commanders and principal officers than for the ser- vice of the field hospitals. Their number was too small for a whole army; and as they were authorized by their commis- sions to receive prisoners and booty, and, like the knights, were obliged to bring with them archers, it is highly probable that to fight was a part of their duty also.

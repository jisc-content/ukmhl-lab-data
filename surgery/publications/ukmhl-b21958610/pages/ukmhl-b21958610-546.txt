All over India, and in the West Indies also, the backs of punished men are dressed most successfully by the young leaf of the plan- tain “ Musa Paradisiaca” of Linnaeus. I his is a prac- tice in all probability adopted from the natives of these coun- tries, and is akin to the water dressings, and other natural pro- ductions employed in the dressing of wounds in savage life, which we would often do well to imitate. The foregoing observations will be sufficient to impress young men with a due sense of the responsibility devolving on a military or naval surgeon, when called upon to superintend the infliction of corporal punishments. It is, I conceive, much less necessary to dwell upon motives of humanity and dis- cretion, • than to caution military surgeons against attempts which are sometimes made to deceive them, by soldiers feigning complaints to evade punishment, and feigning syn- cope or fits during its infliction,—to caution them also against any untimely or undue interference with the discipline of the service, or any vain parade of authority, in the only case in which their authority can be considered as at all paramount to that of the commanding officer. While it may be neces- sary to call to mind what the discipline of the army and navy demands, every thing due to humanity may be very safely trusted to the natural feelings of a British surgeon.

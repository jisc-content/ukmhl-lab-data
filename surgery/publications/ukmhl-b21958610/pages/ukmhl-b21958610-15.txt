Vll PREFACE. Wounds, Gunshot Fractures, and Amputations, it will be seen that I am greatly indebted to some of the leading authorities in military and naval surgery, particularly to the writings of Baron Larrey, the late Dr. Hennen, Messieurs Guthrie, Hutchison, Hammick, and Samuel Cooper. On many points relating to fractures and amputation, I have quoted largely from a series of Clinical Lectures which I delivered some years ago to the Students of Surgery in the Royal Infirmary. To explain the circumstance of these quotations being generally expressed in the past tense, it may be ne- cessary to observe, that the lectures to which I al- lude consisted in a summary of the most interest- ing cases occurring during each course, and of the observations arising out of them, which were deli- vered as a concluding lecture, and subsequently printed for the use of the students. On the subject of Ophthalmia, I have obtained much valuable information from manuscript reports in my possession by Staft-Surgeons Murray, Dease, and Lindsay, and particularly from the writings of Dr. Vetch, whose observations I find to corres- pond, in almost every instance, with my own, and of whose language 1 have frequently availed myself.

MILITARY SURGERY. 2G8 its commencement, is not painful, anti the integuments are ot their natural colour ; the pulsations are strong, particularly in the earlier stages of the disease, and when all the coats are yet entire; a circumstance readily accounted for by the ample and direct communication between the expanded part of the vessel and the direct channel of the blood. When the inner tunics are destroyed, and the external coat alone dilated, th<^_ communication between the canal of the artery and the cavity of the aneurism, though not so large as in the preceding form of aneurism, is more direct and capacious than in a false aneurism ; and therefore the pulsation of the tumour is general- ly stronger than in the latter case. The symptoms of a cir- cumscribed false aneurism, are not materially different from those above stated ; but it is to be observed, that a true aneu- rism generally yields to pressure, and recurs on its discontinu- ance, while a false one yields with difficulty, and the swelling returns very gradually. These circumstances are plainly referri- ble, first, to the diversity in the size of the direct communica- tion between the aneurismal swelling and the canal of the artery ; and secondly, to the circumstance of the blood being often more or less coagulated even in the early stages of the circumscribed false aneurism. With respect to the diffused false aneurism, it generally presents but a feeble and indistinct degree of pulsation, except close to the aperture in the artery; in consequence also of the extensive injection of the cellular membrane with blood, the case is at the same time attended with more discolouration than any other form of aneurism un- accompanied with inflammation. The history of the disease ; its cause; its sudden formation, &c., also tend to assist us in the diagnosis, and are to be carefully considered. These tumours, like abscesses, generally proceed towards the surface of the body ; but in this respect they are much influ- enced by the situation and by the site of the vessel from which they originate. When the sac points externally, it rarely or

EXAMINATION OK RECRUITS. 31 seldom temperate or healthy, helpless, and dependent on im- aginary comforts, are ill calculated for the business of war.” This view of the matter is strongly confirmed by a state- ment contained in a very interesting paper on the health of the Peninsular army, by Sir James M‘Grigor, published in the sixth volume of the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions of London: “ Of the classes of society from which soldiers are recruited, I believe it will be found that, cceteris paribus, tradesmen and manufacturers, particularly those from large towns, are soonest swept away by the fatigues and diseases of an army ; and that those who have followed agricultural pur- suits are the most healthy. Three hundred and fifty-three recruits joined the 7th regiment in Portugal, in the years 1810—11. Of these two hundred and one were artificers and manufacturers, and one hundred and fifty-two had followed agricultural pursuits. In the course of a few months one hundred and twenty-two of the former died, and sixty-two of the latter; the proportion being six out of ten in the former case, and four out of ten in the latter.” These authorities go far to set the question at rest, as to the superiority of the agricultural over the manufacturing part of the population, for the purposes of warfare ; and it is almost superfluous to add, that my own observation induces me to concur entirely in the opinions just quoted. For cer- tain branches of the service ; for the cavalry and horse artil- lery particularly, recruits from the agricultural districts, men accustomed to the management of horses and of wheel car- riages, are still more peculiarly eligible. And it may not be out of place to remark, with reference to the three great branches of the service, and to the description of men best adapted for each, that the infantry of the line are, during active operations, called upon for the most constant and un- remitting exertions, are the most exposed to night duties, and in marching are loaded with their knapsacks, arms, and

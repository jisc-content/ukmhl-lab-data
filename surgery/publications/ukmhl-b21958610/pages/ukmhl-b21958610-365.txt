WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. 345 behind, having lodged under the pubis, and become partially encysted. The operation for the removal of foreign bodies from the bladder is in all respects akin to that for the stone, and the general superiority of the lateral operation over every other, ap- pears to me fully established. It may always be advantageously performed by a staff and straight scalpel, making the direction of the internal incision through the prostate and neck of the bladder, to correspond nearly with the external incision ; and to this mode of operating it becomes army surgeons, above all others, to habituate themselves, as they cannot expect to have the command of any of these complicated contrivances which have been devised with a view to facilitate this operation. The different steps of the lateral operation for the stone I am in the habit of exhibiting to my pupils upon the dead body ; but as these arc shown in every surgical class, and as the symptoms and treatment of urinary calculi are minutely de- tailed in the common systematic works on surgery, and in numerous monographs on the subject, it would be superflu- ous to cidarge upon them in these outlines, particularly as the stone is a disease extremely rare amongst soldiers and sea- men. During a period of twenty-six years1 connexion with the service, I have only known two cases in which stones were ascertained to exist in the persons of soldiers, and the following extract from Dr. Yelloly’s paper on the tendency to calculous diseases, will show that in this respect my own experience coincides with that of numerous army surgeons. —41 In a valuable report published by Sir James Macgrigor, on the diseases of the British army in the peninsula, under the command of the Duke of Wellington, no case of calculus appears to have presented itself during the period of which he treats, viz. between December 1811 and June 1814, though above 380,000 cases were admitted into the general and regi- mental hospitals during that period.

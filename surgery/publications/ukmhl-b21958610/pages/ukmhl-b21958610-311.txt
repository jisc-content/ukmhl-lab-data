WOUNDS OF THE HEAD. 291 purpose of retaining the divided parts in accurate apposition ; but in a large proportion of sabre wounds, slips of adhesive plas- ter will be found sufficient, and this remark is also to be extend- ed to many cases of lacerated wounds of the scalp. Although unable to confirm the fact from personal observation, yet it is proper to mention, as an encouragement to the practice of at- tempting reunion in wounds, detaching portions of the crani- um along with the scalp, that such attempts are reported by the German surgeon Klein, to have been more successful when both tables of the skull were implicated, than when the external table only was injured. Wounds which lay bare any portion of the cranium, or in any degree involve its structure, whether inflicted by the sabre, or by a more obtuse instrument, are always to be considered of a hazardous description. But it would appear that the inhabitants of some foreign countries, particularly the natives of New South Wales, recover again and again from wounds of this description, which to a European would inevitably prove fatal. I have in my possession, a cast from the skull of a well-known cha- racter, chief of a considerable tribe to the northward of Syd- ney, in which the whole upper part of the skull, particularly the frontal and parietal bones, are disfigured by deep and extensive exfoliations, the result of blows received from the waddies, or heavy wooden bludgeons, with which the natives of that country fight. These various inequalities appear, at first sight, to bear very much the character of having been produced by some specific disease, and some of my professional brethren are a little sceptical as to the origin assigned to them; but I am induced to believe it to be the true one, from ob- serving that the inequalities are confined exclusively to those portions, of the skull naturally exposed in their mode of fight- mg, that the lamellated and spongy bones of the nose, the al- veolar processes, and other parts usually attacked by syphi- litic disease, were in this instance sound; and also from thc

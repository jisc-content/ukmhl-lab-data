LUXATIONS. 395 chiefly on a consideration of the action of the adductor and abductor muscles. As that explanation is entirely hypo- thetical, I am not disposed to dwell upon it, and I regret to say that out of four cases of this luxation which I have now seen, only one has been reduced. When the accident hap- pens to the right thumb, as was the case in both of my own patients, if the luxation remains unreduced, it renders a sol- dier incapable of some of the necessary motions with the fire- lock, and nothing can be more vexatious to a military sur- geon than to lose the services of a gallant young soldier from an accident apparently so trifling. Upon luxations of the hip-joint I have no particular ob- servations to offer, either as regards the nature of the acci- dent or its connexion with military life, but 1 cannot omit noticing the valuable sketches which Sir Astley Cooper has given of the different positions of the limb in the accidents affecting this joint. These are admirably adapted to impress upon students the diagnostics of the several luxations, and as a teacher I feel grateful for the facility which I derive from them in explaining the nature of these accidents. Of compound luxation of the knee-joint 1 have seen two instances,—in one of these the limb was amputated, and in the other the patient died without amputation. A simple and at the same time a complete luxation of the knee is an occurrence which I have never met with, and which I be- lieve to be exceedingly rare. The nature of such an accident must be immediately conspicuous, and the replacement of the dislocated bone is not represented as being very difficult. Dislocation of the patella is not an unfrequent accident, and is liable to happen to cavalry soldiers in particular, by striking each other’s knees in the ranks. The most fre- quent displacement of this bone is towards the outside, over the external condyle of the femur, and, for the most part,

OPHTHALMIA. 445 ft hole extent, from a slight opacity which accompanied it, and which daily increased till the greater extent of the cornea was not only opaque, but projected in an irregular cone. As this alteration of structure went on, the vision which continu- ed for some time after the rupture, more correct than be- fore, became completely obstructed. Other cases have occur- red which, by corresponding with the above, confirm the ac- count I have now given, from which it appears that the aqueous humour escapes by a division of the cornea, nearly as clean as if cut by a knife, and that it is to the attempts of the part to effect a re-union, under the presence of disease, that the future deformity is owing. Were the disease to subside immediately after the rupture of the cornea, this accident, in all probability, would not be attended with much permanent injury to the sight; but as, besides the obstacles which the presence of the disease occasions to its healthy re-union, the same causes which produce the first rupture continuing to operate so as to produce a second, or a third, the deformity becomes further augmented, and the termination, with respect to vision, is proportionally unfavourable.” Such is the series of phenomena which generally takes place in an acute attack of purulent ophthalmia, from the first ap- pearance of inflammation, perhaps in mottled spots on the lining membrane of the palpebr®, to the subsequent affection of the whole conjunctiva, the extension of the disease to the sclerotic coat, occasioning an increased secretion of the aque- ous humour, and terminating in rupture of the cornea. The treatment of this affection now claims our attention, and in so far as general remedies are concerned, the practice which I would urge, in the acute stage of ophthalmia and as it occurs amongst young and otherwise healthy soldiers, consists essentially in bleeding and low diet. The obser- vation cannot be too often repeated, that by one early and

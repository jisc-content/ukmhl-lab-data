MILITARY SUROERY. 50G and transparent, without the slightest trace of muscular fibres on it. When the urethra is first opened, there is an appear- ance of muscular fibres running in the length of the canal; but by examining this with attention, we shall find that it is principally owing to the inner membrane having been thrown into folds by the elasticity of the spongy body. We are re- ferred to comparative anatomy for the ocular demonstration of muscular fibres, and it is confidently asserted that circular muscular fibres are seen in the urethra of the horse ; an appearance which seems to be nothing but the internal membrane of the urethra thrown into folds by its own elas- ticity, and by that of the spongy body. The cjaculator se- minis is continued up to the glans in the horse, and when we sec this strong muscle surrounding the whole of the ure- thra, we must be at a loss to suggest a use for muscular fibres in the delicate mucous membrane.” But the muscularity of the urethra has been attempted to be proved more by argu- ments from analogy, and from observations occurring in prac- tice, than from ocular demonstration. The expulsion of an injection in a case of gonorrhoea has been considered as one of the most decided proofs, but if we throw- an injection into the dead penis, the fluid will be thrown out with some force; and Mr. Shaw relates the following experiment in confirma- tion of this fact: he threw- a small quantity of water into the corpus spongionsum, so as to swell the penis a little, making it resemble the state in which we generally see it in gonor- rhoea, and on injecting the urethra, the fluid was thrown out nearly two yards. “ Surely,” he adds, “ no one will say that there was muscular action existing in the urethra of a body almost putrid.” What has been considered the spasmodic action of strictures, at times resisting the passage of a bougie, which on other occa- sions passes easily, and the circumstance of a bougie being oc- casionally grasped in a stricture, so as to require some force in

GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 227 'Mr. Guthrie’s more recent work on the same subject. On Ithcse principles the direction of balls is illustrated at great •length by Vacher, an eminent French surgeon, in the 'Memoirs of the French Academy of Surgery. Regula- ted then by such laws, and acting upon substances so va- rious in texture, as the different organs of which our bodies .ire composed, balls are often found to have their direction •changed by circumstances apparently of a trivial nature ; many instances are upon record, where balls have been avert- ed from their course by striking against a button, a buckle, 1 breast-plate, a watch, or a piece of coin in the pocket, ■and to such an occurrence many a brave man has been ndebted for his life. The course of a ball, after having oenetrated the integuments, is often changed by impinging igainst a bone; and in consequence of the resistance offer- 'd by the bone to its further progress inwards, while the •lasticity and toughness of the common integuments pre- vent its recoil outwards, it is not unfrequcntly found to lave coursed in 4 circular direction nearly round the whole :ontour of the body or of a limb ; and has at last made ts exit or been found to have lodged very near to the dace of entrance, the tract being marked by a weal or dis- colouration of the skin. For various examples of the sin- gular courses of balls, I may refer to the paper of Vacher al- cady quoted, and to the practical work of Dr. Hennen. It has been long known that balls may pass round al- most any part of the body immediately under the integu- aents, without entering any of the three great cavities. Of his I have seen several cases on the head and chest, where alls impinging against the cranium, or against a rib, their arther progress inwards had been prevented, and they cad taken a circular course round a portion of the head r trunk. Some cases of this kind are mentioned in Mr. Hunter’s work, and some in Vachcr’s Memoir; but a fact

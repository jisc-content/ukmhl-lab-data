MILITARY SURGERY". 250 great measure at an end; but you are all aware, that the fear of wounding the epigastric artery, in relieving the stricture, has been the great bugbear in this operation; and this fear has, I believe, had a most injurious effect in the treatment of strangulated inguinal hernia. I illustrated by a diagram the true position of this artery, and showed you that when the hernia, as in M‘Intyre’s case, enters the superior aperture of the inguinal canal, and descends along its course, constituting the oblique, or what Hesselbach terms the external inguinal hernia, the artery lies on the pubic or mesial side of the neck of the sac. When hernia again protrudes directly through the lower aperture of the inguinal canal, forming the direct, the vcntro-inguinal, or what Hesselbach terms the internal hernia, the artery lies on the iliac or lateral side of the neck of the sac. In one or other of these situations this vessel is always to be found, and, of course, by avoiding them both, by cutting neither outwards nor inwards, but directly upwards, parallel to the linea alba, you will in all cases avoid this ar- tery ; and for this practical rule in operating, you are indebt- ed to Sir Astley Cooper, to whom his profession is under so many important obligations. “ In support of the opinion which I gave, that the risk of wounding the epigastric artery had been very much over- rated, I mentioned the fact, that even among the older writers, who were in the habit of making more extensive incisions than are now thought necessary, we find few or no instances of haemorrhage from wounds of the epigastric ; and I stated, that in conversing with the most experienced of my brethren here, I could not find that any one of them had met with a serious or fatal haemorrhage from wounding the epigastric in this operation. With the view of encourag- ing you to have speedy recourse to an operation in stran- gulated hernia, I took the liberty of pressing upon your at- tention the result of the cases which I have had occasion

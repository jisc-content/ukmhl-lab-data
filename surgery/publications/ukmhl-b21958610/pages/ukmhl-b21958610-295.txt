WOUNDS OF THE NERVES. S’]5 ease more tedious and uncertain.” Concurring entirely in Mr. Hodgson’s views upon this point, and considering that the only other mode of treating aneurisms—by pressure—is a process at all times exceedingly tardy, wearisome, and uncer- tain, there appears to me no room for delay in the application of the ligature.

WOUNDS OF THE NEHVES. TETANUS. Wounds of the nerves, although, in the first instance, less alarming, and less hazardous, than those of the arteries, are not less formidable in their after-consequences. Aneurism is an infinitely more manageable disease than tetanus, one of the most severe and one of the least remediable consequences of wounds. Nerves, like other parts of the system, are found capable of

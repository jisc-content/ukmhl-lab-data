WOUNDS OF THE THORAX. 317 deeply, haemoptysis must occur from the blood finding its way into the larger branches of the bronchia?; but in superficial wounds of the lungs, blood may be effused to a considerable extent without any being expectorated, of which I have seen one remarkable instance. Besides the branches of the pulmo- nary artery within the lungs, another source of haemorrhage in wounds of the thorax, is the intercostal and internal mam- mary arteries. Haemorrhage, from the last mentioned vessel, is exceedingly difficult to detect or to control, and I have seen two instances of fatal bleeding from this source. In wounds of the intercostals, accompanied with fractures of the ribs, the source of the haemorrhage is often obvious, and various expedients have been suggested for its suppression; the passage of a curved needle, armed with a ligature com- pletely round the rib, and compressing the wounded artery by means of a pledget placed over its orifice, and included in the ligature, was an expedient practised by Blench, and by Theden, the Prussian Surgeon-General. The employment of agaric or sponge, with continued compression by the hands of successive assistants, or the compressive purse of Desault, is the plan which has been most generally employed in sup- pressing haemorrhage from the intercostals; but wherever it is possible to secure the bleeding vessel with a ligature by means of the tenaculum or dissecting forceps, it should at once be employed. The tying of a wounded intercostal must neces- sarily be considered as an operation of difficulty, but the de- terminate position of the vessel, running along the inferior margin of the rib, offers some facility in its execution, and when the wound is originally large, or when it has been enlarged for the express purpose, and where the patient is not very corpulent, it may be attempted with considerable chance of success. The accumulation of blood within the thorax from one or other of the sources which I have mentioned, is one of the first

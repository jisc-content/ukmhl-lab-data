MILITARY SCRGERY. 334 toms which particularly characterise wounds of the liver, are a discharge from the wound of a bilious character, yellow and glutinous, and sometimes of the colour of bile, but of a thin serous consistence. To this is superadded derangement of the functions of the stomach and bowels, and in some cases a general and troublesome itching of the skin over the whole surface of the body, with a jaundiced state of the skin and urine. The medical treatment in wounds of this organ resolves itself into measures for obviating inflammatory symptoms, di- minishing the ingesta, and ensuring the regular evacuation of the bowels, chiefly by the use of the mildest purgatives and emollient glysters; the topical applications are leeches and fo- mentations. Wounds of the Spleen are rare, in so much that Baron Larrey has only seen three cases in the course of his extended experience. They are chiefly recognised by the site of the wound, and by the faintness, pallor, and coldness of the sur- face, denoting internal hannorrhage, which the peculiar texture of this organ readily affords. We are also guided in our diagnosis by the absence of those symptoms, indicating wounds of the contiguous viscera, the stomach, the kidney, and splenic flexure of the colon. Wounds of the spleen in situ arc to be treated by those means, to the use of which I have so often had occasion to limit my recommendations in the treatment of penetrating wounds of the great cavities, viz. bleeding and abstinence. The useless, not to say cruel expe- riment of removing the spleen, to which dogs have been so often subjected with unsatisfactory and contradictory results, has also, from necessity however, and not from choice, been performed on the human subject. Although incisions into the Kidney have been proposed, and wounds voluntarily inflicted upon this organ, for the purpose nf removing calculi; although indeed the operation of nc-

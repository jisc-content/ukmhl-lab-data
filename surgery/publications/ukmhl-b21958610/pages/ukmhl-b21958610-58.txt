3 ii MILITARY SURGERY. The conqueror is ordinarily frugal and homely; the con- quered is frequently rich, luxurious, and what is called re- fined. It is reported of General Wolfe, who, while a man of superior goodness, was perhaps the most perfect soldier of the age in which he lived, that the cook and butler did not much engage his attention. He never gave an elegant, and rarely an eatable dinner to persons of the liaut gout; the epicurean was disgusted—the soldier was regaled. General Wolfe’s table was said to be an epitome of a Spartan mers- room ; no one rose from it without having been furnished with the opportunity of carrying away a military lesson; and few left it without feeling an accession of military importance communi- cated to the mind by the impressive influence of a hero’s spirit.” In his last work on the “ Formation, Discipline, and Economy of Armies,” Dr. Jackson has adduced much inge- nious argument in support of his views of this subject; and he concludes by observing, that luxurious living places the military character on the brink of destruction ; “ for,” says he, “ if there be any thing like correct observation among men, it may be confidently asserted that, if high living be the life of the gentleman, it is the death of the soldier.” It is obvious, however, that such observations as the foregoing, al- though just in themselves, can only be addressed with pro- priety to the officers—to the educated and reflecting part of the army ; and habits of abstinence are so little congenial to the disposition of an English soldier, that he will never prac- tise them when he can do otherwise.

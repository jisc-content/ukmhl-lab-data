MILITARY SURGERY.- 292 statement of Mr. Drummond, surgeon In the navy, by whose kindness I was favoured with this interesting cast, and who assures me, that “ the gentleman who gave him the head knew almost each occasion on which the various injuries were received.” Mr. Drummond’s letter to me contains some very interesting statements, as to the facility with which the natives of that country recover from injuries of the crani- um, and the habitual indifference with which fractures of the bones in general, are treated by them ; in proof of which, he mentions that “ both their sable majesties of the Sydney blacks are found to have artificial joints in the forearm.” Punctured wounds, from the bayonet or pike, are much less frequent in the head than in the trunk of the body ; and unless inflicted through the orbits, through the face, or towards the base of the skull, they do not in general penetrate deeply ; wounds inflicted by a bayonet, however, on the upper globu- lar part of the head, frequently penetrate obliquely between the integuments and bone, the point of the instrument being turned aside by the latter. In such cases, a puffy erysipelatous swelling of the integuments, with great tension and tenderness of the scalp, are exceedingly liable to occur; and where this is threatened, much may be done to obviate it by judicious incisions or scarifications. By sueh incisions we procure a dis- charge of blood,—we anticipate the effects of that tumefaction and tension which so generally occur in such wounds,—we prevent perhaps the formation, and at any rate the lodg- ment, of matter over the bone. The supervention of erysipelatous inflammation on wounds of the scalp, is an occurrence extremely common, and liable to frustrate our views of reunion. This has been attributed to the peculiarly dense texture of the scalp, or to the tendinous expan- sion of the occipito-frontalis muscle being implicated in the wound. The employment of stitches has been spoken of by some, and the use of adhesive straps by others, as if they

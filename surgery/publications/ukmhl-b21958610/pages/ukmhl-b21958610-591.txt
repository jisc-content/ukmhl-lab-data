LIVER DISEASE. 571 lections of pus, similar to what are termed vomica; in the lungs. The whole mass of the liver, in such cases, is generally altered in colour ; it assumes an appearance as if parboiled, and be- comes much firmer in texture than natural; insomuch, that on cutting into its substance, a sensation is communicated to the hand of the dissector as if his knife were passing through a cartilaginous mass. The small quantity of blood which flows from an incision into a liver in this indurated state is also remarkable. Although white spots on the surface of the liver, and tubercles in its substance, with other anomalous appearances, are sometimes met with in India, yet in that country such appearances are comparatively rare ; while sup- puration and induration, the more common and legitimate results of a preceding inflammation, are extremely common. The gall-bladder does not exhibit any general or uniform morbid appearance; sometimes it is a little thickened in its coats, and consequently diminished in capacity, while the bile itself is frequently found thickened or inspissated. In the treatment of hepatitis, of the symptoms, and con- sequences of which I have now given a brief sketch, our most strenuous efforts should be directed to prevent suppura- tion ; for although I do not mean to assert, that whenever the liver suppurates, the patient must inevitably die from this cause, yet 1 believe that after such an event very few recove- ries take place, and that an individual has little chance of enjoying any thing like health and comfort under the vicissi- tudes of a soldierâ€™s life. Recoveries would be more fre- quent were we enabled by any means to procure an early derivation of the matter to the surface, and to make an opening for its exit; but in these deep-seated abscesses, such is the resistance opposed to their progress outwards, and such the facility with which the substance of the liver gives way to the ulcerative process, that we are often sur- prised to find an enormous collection of matter accumulated,

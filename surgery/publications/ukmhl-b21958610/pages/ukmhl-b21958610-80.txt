The most judicious plans of practice may be laid down, but, under such circumstances, it will be next to impossible that they can prove successful.11 It is to be wished that more recent experience would enable me to give a different picture of the disadvantages attend- ing the billeting of soldiers throughout England, but these, as pourtrayed by Dr. Hamilton, are in every particular perfectly coincident with my own observation ; and of the fatal consequences which sometimes occur from the practice of billeting soldiers, one of the last cases which I had occasion to treat in the service afforded a melancholy example.

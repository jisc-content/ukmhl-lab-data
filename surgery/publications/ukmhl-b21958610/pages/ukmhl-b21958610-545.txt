There are two modifica- tions of corporal punishment employed in the navy, which naturally add much to its severity; in what is termed Flog- ging round the Jleet, the culprit is conveyed in a boat, with certain ceremonies, from ship to ship, receiving in succession a proportion of lashes from the boatswain’s mate of each, while the respective crews are paraded to witness the infliction.

Even when the punishment has been severe, and the parts in consequence ulcerate considerably, lotions of this kind arc found eligible; but when the ulceration becomes ex- tensive, and puts on a sloughing or gangrenous form, it falls

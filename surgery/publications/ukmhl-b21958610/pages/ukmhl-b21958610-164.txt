MILITARY SURGERY. 144 expires. The dangerous symptoms which proceed from the ex- tent of a superficial burn or scald in one instance, may equally result in another from an injury more circumscribed but pe- netrating deeper, so that in all cases, in estimating the dan- ger from burns, attention must be paid both to their extent superficially, and to the depth to which they may have affect- ed the subjacent textures; circumstances which are greatly influenced by the nature of the burning body, and the length of time it may have remained in contact with the skin. Thus it has been observed, that scalds occasioned by boiling liquids are more or less severe according to the various capa- cities of these liquids for caloric ; and burns from metallic bodies when the period of contact has been the same are propor- tioned to the heat of the metal. The danger is also dependant upon the age and constitution of the patient, and on the seat of the injury. Such accidents are generally considered more dan- gerous in cachectic habits, in childhood and in advanced years, than in hale constitutions and in the prime of life; more dan- gerous when seated about the head or trunk, than when affect- ing the extremities. When burns are occasioned by the contact of hot fluids, the first phenomena which present themselves are, redness of the skin and pungent pain in the burned part; to which succeed vesication, in consequence of a serous effusion under the cuticle, and a slight degree of swelling. The appear- ance and extent of the vesication is greatly influenced by the natural thickness of the cuticle in different parts of the body, and the facility with which it is detached from the subjacent texture. Thus vesications in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, where the cuticle is thick and firmly adherent, are generally less extensive, and slower in making their appearance, than in other parts of the body. These local phenomena, when of limited extent, and confined to the ex-

MILITARY SURGERY. 562 it would be of little avail to exhibit remedies calculated to restore a healthy action to the liver, while the patient is dying of mortification of the colon. In the chronic or hepa- tic form of flux again, many circumstances combine to induce us to consider it more of a constitutional disease than the preceding. The circumstance of its prevailing chiefly amongst men some time resident in India, the degree of fever which is always more or less conspicuous, the diseased secretions apparent in the stools, and in the matter rejected by vomiting, all tend to mark a disease in which a more general derange- ment of the functions of the glandular viscera of the abdomen and of the intestinal tube takes place. That in this disease the functions of the liver, the stomach, and upper part of the intestinal canal are greatly impaired seems obvious ; of which the vitiated secretions, the frequent attacks of vomiting, the passing of indigested portions of food along with the faeces, and therapid emaciation of the patient, appear to me abundantproofs. While, then, in the acute form of disease, our attention is to be directed to the diminution of a violent inflammatory affec- tion of the colon, threatening to terminate in mortification and death, in the more chronic form of disease, our object is to restore healthy secretions, and to obviate a general affection and tendency to disease in the chylopoctic viscera, without a mark- ed inflammation of any particular organ. With these views of the indications in the treatment of dysentery, 1 proceed to observe, that, in the worst form, or inflammatory stage of it, blood-letting is the remedy upon which our chief dependance must be placed. But, in expressing a favourable opinion of this practice, I must candidly own, that it is grounded more on the ravages of inflammation so uni- versally apparent in the dead, than on any repeated or exten- sive experience of its beneficial effects in the living. In those cases of dysentery in which I have employed bleeding, the majority have, I think, terminated favourably, and of those.

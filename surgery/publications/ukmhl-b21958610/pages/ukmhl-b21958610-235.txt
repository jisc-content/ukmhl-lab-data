PUNCTURED WOUNDS. E?15 bleeding for the cough every night; what did he do but raise inflammation with his left hand, to shew how well he could subdue it with his right ? 1 Instead of adopting a practice calculated to aggravate in- flammation,our chief care ought to be, to adopt measures calcu- lated to keep it under ; to prevent, if possible, its termination in suppuration ; and, if this cannot be accomplished, to ensure an early discharge to the matter. If the wound is slight, the ap- plication of a piece of adhesive plaster on the orifice is often all that is requisite, particularly if the wound is situat- ed in a part of the body where no fascia or membranous expansion has been penetrated ; but when the injury is more considerable, when the patient is young and vigorous, and when the wound may have penetrated any of the great cavities, we must be assiduous in the use of every means calculated to pre- vent and to allay excessive inflammation. With this view, blood- letting, saline purgatives, nauseating doses of the antimonial so- lution, and the most abstemious diet, are often necessary. The blood-letting may be practised both generally and locally ; for the latter purpose, the application of leeches round the orifice of the wound, when they can be procured, is highly advantage- ous, but when not, the general bleeding must be pushed far- ther, and the local treatment may be trusted, in the first in- stance, to cooling saturnine lotions applied to the wounded part. Should the pain and tension increase under the use of these means, they may in general be advantageously withdrawn, and wann anodyne fomentations substituted for them during the day, with emollient cataplasms during the night. In all cases of recent punctured wounds, any bandages requisite to retain the dressings should be applied with very moderate tightness, so as not to prove an obstacle to the swelling of the wounded limb, which in general speedily takes place. When the pain is severe, in punc- tured wounds, and when much constitutional irritability ex-

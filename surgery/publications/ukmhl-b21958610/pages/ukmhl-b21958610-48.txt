The teacher must not only instruct his pupils for the present, he must select objects for their future study. He must teach them this truth, that their education is only be- gun, and that the best of their studies remain as yet untouch- ed ; he must show them how to think for themselves, and then he may hope to reap in his turn the fruit of their la- bours, and live to see their observations and cases published under his own care.’1 Of the peculiarities of the study on which we are about to enter, I have already attempted to give some general idea. Every candid man who is conversant with the recent writings of military and of naval surgeons, will admit that there are a sufficient number of accidents peculiar to njilitary life, or at least of accidents so modified in their nature, progress, and treatment, by the circumstances peculiar to military life, as to afford ample room for a course of this kind ; and of the nume- rous inducements which are held out to the study of surgery in general, none are more striking than those arising from its obvious importance to military men. “ We must,” says Dionis, “ allow the necessity of chirurgery, which daily raises many persons from the brink of the grave. How many men has it cured in the army ? How many great commanders would have died of their ghastly wounds without its assistance ? Chirurgery triumphs in armies and in sieges. ’Tis there that its empire is owned ; ’tis there that its effects, and not words, express its culogium.”

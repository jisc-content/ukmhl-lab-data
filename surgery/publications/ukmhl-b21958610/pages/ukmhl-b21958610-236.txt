When in spite of all our efforts to mitigate the in- flammation, matter is nevertheless formed, we must endeavour to procure for it a free and speedy discharge, either by enlarging the wound, or making a counter opening. The practice of dilating wounds, formerly reprobated, comes now to have a meaning; an important object is to be attained; an object which can often be attained in no other way—even the use of setons comes now to be sometimes a useful practice,—and al- though, amongst young, and otherwise healthy soldiers, few cases occur of a defect of inflammatory action in the treatment of wounds, yet it is possible, that, when from the exfoliation of bones or the sloughing of tendons—processes always tedi- ous,—the patient’s constitution may be impaired, and his energies diminished, cases will occur in which the intro- duction of a seton may very much expedite the cure. There is one particular description of punctured wounds which- requires peculiar attention, namely, those inflicted by the bites of rabid animals, and venomous serpents. These form frequent objects of attention to military surgeons when serving on foreign stations ; and it is much to be regretted that so little practical information of a satisfactory kind is to be met with on this'subject. This naturally happens from the little inclination which a professional man feels to write upon a class of accidents where both the curative and the preventative means, usually recommended, are so little to be depended upon. When the peculiar symptoms resulting from poisoned wounds have once supervened, the recoveries are extremely few ; and when these symptoms are supposed to have been prevented, we are always left in doubt whether this has been the conse- quence of our measures or not. It has been my fortune, whether good or bad, to sec a greater number of deaths from the bites of rabid animals than most ol my standing in the profession. I have seen not less than

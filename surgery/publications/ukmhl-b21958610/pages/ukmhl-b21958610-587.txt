567 LIVER DISEASE. LIVER DISEASE. This disease, when it occurs in an acute form, with all its usual diagnostics, is easy of detection, and in general leads to a practice sufficiently active and amply successful. “ It may,1’ says Dr. Chisholm, “ be generally observed, that regular acute hepatitis is a very tractable disease, if early known, and suit- able means promptly and judiciously administered.” It is not, therefore, by this well marked form of the disease that so many lives are lost, and to which the health and vigour of so many Europeans are prostrated in tropical climates; but in these climates insidious and ill-marked cases of liver dis- ease steal upon us unawares, and proceed to an extreme, from which there is no chance of recovery, without giving either patient or surgeon a sufficient degree of alarm. While, in a great majority of cases, affections of the liver are obviously the joint effects of climate and intemperance, we find them in others the result of climate alone, and in such cases they are often very obscurely marked. It is a singular fact, that, in a register of deaths kept in the regiment with which I served in India, in a period of seven years, and out of up- wards of five hundred deaths, twenty-seven only are ascribed to hepatitis. This, however, I am persuaded, is not the pro- portion which this disease bears to the other fatal diseases of the country, for this register shows only the disease under which a patient was admitted into hospital; and many have, no doubt, been registered under the head of fever or dysentery, where symptoms of these were alone conspicuous at the time of their admission, while eventually they have died of dis- eased liver. Upon the relative proportion of these diseases in India and elsewhere, much valuable information will be found in Mr. Marshall’s sketch of the geographical distribution of diseases in a recent number of the Edinburgh Medical Journal.

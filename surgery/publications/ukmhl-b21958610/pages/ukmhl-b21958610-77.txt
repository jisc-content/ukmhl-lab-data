ACCOMMODATION OF TROOPS. 57 : and overheated, and which are furnished with fixed bed-places that do not admit of a free circulation of air under them, per- forations on a level with the floor and with the ceiling should never be omitted. The same should be introduced into black- holes, and other places of confinement, which frequently prove sources of much more severe punishment than they were ever intended to be. In barrack necessaries the due admission of air is seldom sufficiently attended to by architects, insomuch that offensive and noxious vapours are accumulated and re- tained, while the detection of the most palpable filth is but too often rendered difficult by the want of a sufficiency of light. In cases where it is necessary, for the sake of admit- ting light, to have windows opening into close or inaccessi- ble areas, it would be well that such windows were invariably place d at such a height from the floor, and so grated over as to prevent dirty or indolent soldiers from throwing out filthy or offensive matters into places whence they cannot easily be removed. The system of dry scrubbing for cleaning the floors of bar- racks has now universally taken place of the practice of fre- quent washing, in all weathers, which formerly existed, and which in many instances was found injurious to the health of the soldiers ; but there are certain circumstances under which washing with soap and hot w'ater, or scouring with sand, may still be requisite. Byâ€™the general introduction of iron bed- steads into barracks, cleanliness has been essentially promoted, and ventilation improved; for those cumbersome w:ooden bed- steads formerly in use, not only obstructed the circulation of air, but even materially diminished the cubical bulk of it con- tained in a room. In rooms perforated as I have proposed, the bedsteads should be placed, relatively to the perforations, in such a manner that the air beneath them should be con- stantly changing, and its current directed along the floors and walls. This may be done cither by placing a bedstead over

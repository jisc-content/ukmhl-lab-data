455 OPHTHALMIA. known in very early times, and are adverted to in the works of Celsus in the first century, of Paulus of iEgina in the se- venth, of Phases, the Arabian, in the tenth, and in the work of Sir William Reid in the reign of Queen Anne; that, consequently, no person in the present day can on this subject claim more than the merit of having revived knowledge which had fallen into neglect. Your Committee do not feel it ne- cessary to pronounce between the conflicting claims upon this head, or by recommending a parliamentary reward for such revival, to decide to whom that merit properly belongs ; they conceive that question is best left to the decision of the pro- fession and of the public. But they are of opinion that Sir William Adams has, among others, been greatly instrumental in promulgating this knowledge, and in rendering it generally available.‚Äù How any pretensions to discovery on the part of Sir W.

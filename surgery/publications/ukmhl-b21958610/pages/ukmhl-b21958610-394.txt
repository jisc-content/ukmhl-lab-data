This ought particularly to be observed in the application of those temporary and often imperfect expe- dients which we must adopt in securing a fractured limb, dur- ing the removal of a patient from the field of battle, or land- ing him from a ship of war. It is chiefly in reference to fractures of the inferior extre- mity, that this question of relaxing the muscles becomes of paramount importance, and the different view of the subject adopted by the English and by the French surgeons, was fol- lowed, for a series of years, by a very marked difference in their practice ; the former adopting the bent position, and the latter the extended. Of late, however, I believe that the surgeons of both countries are disposed to take a less exclu- sive view of this matter; and my own experience tells me, that in the infinite variety of fractures which one has occasion to see in the course of a long run of hospital practice, he will find that a fractured limb sometimes lies best in one position, sometimes in another, without his being always able to see very distinctly the reason why. An early bias, derived per- haps from the study of Mr. Pott’s writings, and the observa- tion that the limbs naturally fall into the bent position during sleep, have made me partial to this position in the treatment of fractures of the lowrer extremities. But there is one im- portant consideration by which I have often been guided, and which army and navy surgeons above all others must never lose sight of. In military practice we are not always

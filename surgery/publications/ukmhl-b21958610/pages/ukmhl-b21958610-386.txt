MILITARY SURGERY. 3G6 out to you, that when the bone is broken, as in this instance, above the insertion of the pectoralis major and latissimus dor- si, these powerful muscles tend to draw the lower fragment of the bone towards the trunk, away from the head of the hume- rus w hich remains attached to the glenoid cavity of the scapu- la ; when the fracture, again, passes through that part of the bone into which the two last mentioned muscles are inserted, both fragments are naturally drawn towards the trunk ; and when the fracture is below the insertion of these muscles, it is the superior fragment of the bone which is drawn by them towards the trunk of the body, while the lower "fragment is drawn outwards and upwards by the deltoid. These, I re- marked, were not to be considered as the only muscles tending to displace the broken fragments of the bone, but they are by far the most powerful; and by leaving the others out of view for a moment, you will, I think, be better enabled to under- stand the true position which the broken ends of the bone ge- nerally assume in fractures of the upper part of the humerus; and you will readily perceive, in treating them, the propriety of placing, along with the splints on the outside of the arm, a pad or cushion in the axilla, so as to operate on one or other, or both fragments of the bone, as the case may re- quire.'” Fractures of the neck of the thigh-bone, although chiefly incident to people in advanced life, beyond the age of military service, are nevertheless occasionally met with amongst the various accidents to which soldiers and seamen arc liable. This fracture, like that of the neck of the humerus, is, in some rare cases, accompanied with so little displacement, that I have, in one instance, known a patient to walk after a frac- ture of the neck of the thigh-bone ; and from a memoir of Sabatier’s, it will be seen that the same thing has been observed by others. But the common consequences of a fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, arc complete lameness

35 examination of recruits. head, where, if any obvious defect in its general formation, (r any marks of severe fracture, with depression, nodes, exostoses, or tinea capitis, are observed, they must be considered as un- fitting this individual for the service. All defects in the eye or lachrymal passages, polypi in the nose, malignant tumours in the mouth, extensive deficiency particularly of the front teeth, any appearance of caries in the jaws, either upper or under, are for the most part sufficient causes of rejection. In the neck, tumours, or rigidity of the muscles, with the marks^of previous scrofulous ulcerations, are the circumstances most commonly met with as causes of incapacity, Distortions of the spine, and original malformations, or injuries leading to distortions of the ribs or sternum, so as to affect the circula- tion or respiration, are decided causes of rejection ; as are all indications of a phthisical habit.

Distortions of the anns, thighs, legs, or ancles; exostoses, nodes, ulcers, or extensive cicatrices of ul- cers ; varicose veins, and contractions or rigidity of the joints, are all to be looked upon as causes of rejection. By adopting this systematic mode of proceeding in succession over the head, trunk, and extremities, much time will be saved ; any very serious defect can scarcely escape the surgeon’s observation ; and it behoves him, as he values his own credit, the character of his corps, and the interest of his Majesty’s service, to be accurate and minute in this inspection. A duty of equal difficulty and importance devolves upon the military surgeon, in deciding upon the cases of men about to be discharged from the service, particularly of such as are to become a permanent charge to the public as pensioners or an- nuitants. While, in the examination of recruits, it is the surgeon’s duty to see that no man is admitted into the army,

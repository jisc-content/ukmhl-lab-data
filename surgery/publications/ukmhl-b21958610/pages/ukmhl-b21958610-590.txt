570 MILITARY SURGERY. evacuations also are often remarkable in colour, being some- times darker sometimes lighter than natural, often alternating in this way, according to periodical accessions of activity or torpor in the liver, and an alternate increase or diminution in the secretion of the bile. The urine is scanty, and frequently deposits a copious flaky sediment. The peculiar sallowness of complexion and jaundiced eye, which some authors have held to be particularly characteristic of liver disease, I do not dwell upon, conceiving, that although, in obscure cases, this may assist our diagnosis in Europe, and although, perhaps, it may generally originate in diseased liver, or indicate a pre- disposition to that affection, yet we see it so frequent in India, that, as a diagnostic symptom of disease, it becomes compa- ratively unimportant. On dissecting patients who have died of hepatitis, the ap- pearances of course differ materially, according to the rapidity and violence with which the symptoms have proceeded. In acute cases of the disease, when it proves speedily fatal by terminating in suppuration, it is not uncommon to find one, or both lobes of the liver almost wholly converted into matter ; partly serous and partly purulent, confined in a sac formed by the peritoneal coat of the liver. In a few cases of this kind I have found the diaphragm eroded, and the matter commu- nicating with the extreme branches of the bronchia, through which, when the patient has survived for any length of time, it has been discharged by expectoration. In many instances, an extensive adhesion is formed between the liver and trans- verse arch of the colon ; from which it is apparent that the matter may thus find its way into the intestinal canal, and be discharged by stool. Although I believe that abscesses of the liver have occasionally been discharged in this way, I have never really seen such a communication in the dead body. In the chronic form of disease, instead of meeting with an abscess of any remarkable size, we generally find several small distinct col-

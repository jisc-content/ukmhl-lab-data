TllOriCAL DVSENTERY. 565 The next important remedy which has been recommended in the treatment of dysentery is mercury ; and however highly I am disposed to think of this remedy in the chronic form or advanced stages of the disease, I have never been able to see the benefits of its exhibition in the acute inflammatory affec- tion of the colon. In compliance with the practice prevalent at Prince of Wales Island, when the Royals landed there in 11507, we were induced to prescribe mercury in our dysenteric cases to the extent of producing profuse salivation ; but this practice was speedily abandoned from being found decidedly unsuccessful, and from our soon ascertaining by dissection that these cases were not dependent upon any conspicuous disease of the liver, which we had been led to expect, and in which view mercury was thought an appropriate remedy. Hav- ing never resumed the general use of mercury, in the acute dysentery, at any subsequent period of my service in India, I am unable to say more of it from my personal experience; but it is necessary to notice the use of this mineral, in the form of calomel combined with opium, from which we are assured by Drs. Johnson, Annesley, and others, that the most essential benefit may be derived, and in urgent cases it is recommended to be given to the extent of a scruple, combined with two or three grains of opium, two or three times in the twenty-four hours. As I have no experience to guide me in speaking of this treatment, I give it chiefly on the authority of l)r. Johnson, who first recommended the practice. If, in the acute form of dysentery, I refrain from any gene- ral, and, as I conceive, unmerited commendation of this power- ful medicine, it is only to offer my testimony to its beneficial ef- fects in the chronic form of the disease. The general success of mercury, under every form, in the cure of hepatic fluxes, shows the extensive powers of the medicine, and the little comparative importance of the form in which it may be administered, a point

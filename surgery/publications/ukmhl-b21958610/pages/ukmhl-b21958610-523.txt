STRICTURES. 503 as in all others, rest anti abstinence are of essential bene- fit ; the local application of leeches, anodyne fomentations and sedative lotions, with a horizontal posture, and suspension of the testicle by a proper bandage, are often speedily followed by an abatement of the inflammation, and a rapid diminution of the swelling. But it not unfrequently happens, that a con- siderable degree of induration, sometimes in the whole body of the testicle, but more especially in the epididymis, remains af- ter the bulk of the swelling is removed. Frictions with cam- phorated mercurial liniment, and repeated blisters, are the means which I have found most efficacious in the removal of these chronic indurations. In short, the treatment of swelled testicle is to he conducted on the same principles which regu- late our conduct in the treatment of other glandular swellings; and it is therefore unnecessary to enter into a more particu- lar enumeration of the measures required. STRICTURES. Before entering upon the consideration of the nature and treatment of strictures, it may be necessary to advert to the dimensions and structure of the urethra. This canal, which commences at the bladder, passes out from the pelvis un- der the symphysis pubis, and entering the corpus spon- giosum of the penis, is continued forwards through the centre of that body, until it terminates at the extremity of the glans. In this course the following remarkable dilatations are observed : one immediately at its commencement, where it is encompassed writh the prostate gland ; one immediately ante- rior to its exit from under the pubes, which is termed its bulb, and for the most part also a dilatation less capacious and

MILITARY SURGERY. 402 quet and the ligature has made this operation more a matter of option than formerly. We are not now compelled to resort to it as a desperate expedient, as a forlorn hope, after the failure of other means, but have the choice of adopting it from the first, wherever it may promise to benefit our patient by alleviating his sufferings, by shortening his confinement, or by affording him the use of an artificial limb, when we can have no hope of preserving the utility of the natural one.

Mr. Hutchison, along with several other navy surgeons, has denied that any such collapse follows these injuries as to prove a bar to the operation, and that where numbers are wounded the requisite operations should be performed in as quick succession as the surgeon can possibly overtake them ; that, in short, the maxim of “ making the knife follow the shot as speedily as possible,” is the correct rule of practice.

MILITARY SURGERY. 80 the hospital consists of two or more floors, the surgery, store- rooms, kitchen, and* in short, all the offices necessarily ap- pertaining to an hospital, should be situated in the ground floor, in order that additional space may be left for the ac- commodation of patients above. The subject of ventilation it is unnecessary to resume at any length, having already expressed myself fully on this point, in regard to barracks, and suggested a plan which, with due modification, is equally applicable to hospitals. In some instances, the supply of fresh air has been provided for by constructing a series of channels, or air-tubes, under the flooring of the wards, which communicate directly with the external atmosphere, and deliver the air into the wards through grated apertures in the floors. This plan of ventilation has lately been introduced into the clinical wards of the Royal Infirmary here, and also into the wards of the building formerly occupied as the High School, and now appropriated to the accommodation of the surgi- cal department of the Infirmary ; to those last mentioned wards I may refer as affording an excellent example of every thing that is desirable as to shape, size, height of roof, &c. The lead- ing principle upon which all our plans for ventilation should be founded, is the simple fact, that air heated by respiration naturally rises to the tops of the wards, while the cooler and heavier air occupies the lower parts ; hence judicious openings at the top and bottom of a ward will always ensure the exit of the upper stratum of air, with an influx from be- low to occupy its place. And 1 would only remark, that, while ill ventilated hospitals have, on the one hand, been re- presented as the ruin of an army, they have, on the other hand, when duly regulated in this respect, been looked upon as one of its greatest blessings. Sir John Pringle speaks of hospitals, although intended for its preservation, as one of the chief causes of sickness and death in an army, â€œ on account of

550 MILITARY SURGERY. pear to me, in every essential point, akin to those of our East and West India possessions ; but it may not be out of place to notice here the following prophylactic measures suggested by Drs. Borland, Lempriere, and Sir G. Blane, for the protec- tion of the troops at Walcheren in 1809- “ The troops should not be oppressed with duty, or enjoy less than four nights in bed. On the evenings of the nights on which they mount guard, an extra allowance of spirits to each man would be essentially beneficial ; and when relieved next morning, a comfortable warm breakfast of strong coffee should be in readiness. “ The barracks ought to be of the best description, well guarded from cold and damp, with boarded floors; stoves and flues, suitably directed to convey an equal temperature to the remotest corners, to be placed in each room. On no account should ground-floors be used for sleeping apartments. The more lofty the buildings the better ; for the tenants of the up- per stories not only enjoy the best health, but when taken ill have the disease in the mildest form, an instance of which came under our observation when we visited Fort Ramakins ; and the same is confirmed by the experience of the natives. “ The clothing of the soldier should be of warm quality, and in the best repair. He should be equipped with woollen stockings and flannel waistcoats, the frequent changes of which merit particular attention from his officer. The shoes should be strong, of the best water-proof leather, to guard against the peculiar damp of the country. The pantaloons should be of a spongy warm texture, blue or grey, in preference to white, that there may be no temptation to adopt the pernicious cus- tom of cleaning them with wetted pipe-clay. “ The diet, especially in the sickly period, should be nutri- tive, and the broths well spiced with pepper; during which season a small portion of unmixed spirits might be usefully allowed early in the morning.”

516 MILITARY SURGERY. abduction, and the surgeon has free access with his fingers, to the perineum, and to the rectum, if necessary, for guiding the bougie. This instrument ought always to be warmed and besmeared with oil or lard previously to its introduction, and where a solid metal bougie or catheter is to be carried be- yond the arch of the pubes, I consider the following remarks of Mr. Bingham well deserving attention; they convey the sentiments which I have long entertained upon this point, and I know not where to find these sentiments better expressed. “ Until the point of the curved instrument reaches below the arch of the pubes, it may be introduced either with its concavity or its convexity towards the patient’s abdomen ; the former is the most simple, and therefore the preferable mode, except it be rendered impracticable by the protuberance of the patient’s abdomen. The manner of passing the instrument with its convexity towards the patient’s body is objectionable, because, when its point has got past the arch of the pubes, it must be turned half round to reverse the position of the other end, and in effecting this turn, if the point be not made the cen- tre of motion, there will be great danger of injuring the ure- thra. In taking this semicircular sweep, the instrument must be allowed to be loose upon the surgeon’s hand, and he must delicately accommodate his hand to its movements as it in- clines to approach to or recede from the body whilst he gently carries it round, and then the urethra surrounding it will de- termine the centre of motion to the point. But if the surgeon exerts the slightest degree of control beyond what has been mentioned, the point of the instrument will never constitute the centre of motion, and he will incur risk of doing mischief great in proportion to his unnecessary interference.” It now only remains for us to advert to those troublesome and dangerous cases of stricture accompanied with a complete retention of urine, and where no instrument can be passed into the bladder. In such cases three modes of proceeding

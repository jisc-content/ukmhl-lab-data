WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 3J3 fractures, there generally exist numerous splinters and frag- ments of dead bone in the neighbourhood of the wound, which prevent a speedy reunion. These dead portions of bone must come away by exfoliation, and having not un- frequcntly to make their way through callus or newly formed bone with which they become surrounded, the process of their complete detachment and final expulsion sometimes oc- ' cupies months or even years. In the treatment of gunshot fractures, our principal care must be, after removing splinters which are completely detach- ed, to subdue the inflammatory symptoms, by general and lo- cal antiphlogistic measures ; and it is only when these inflam- matory symptoms have been removed, and reunion about to take place, that it becomes an object to secure an accurate .co- aptation by means of a particular position of the limb, splints, and bandages. The process of reunion in fractures of the thigh will perhaps hardly commence till towards the expira- tion of three weeks; and hence, whatever advantages we may afterwards expect from the extended position of the limb, it may, I believe, previous to the twentieth day, be with great propriety left in the semi-bent position without splints or band- age. Indeed, whatever diversity of opinion exists amongst surgeons with regard .to the position of tire limb in simple fractures, the propriety of relaxing as far as possible theinjiuv ed muscles in cases of compound, and particularly of gunshot fractures, is in my opinion indisputable. This, however, is by no means easily attainable in those injuries to which I am now more particularly adverting; for when a ball or other mis- sile passes through a limb, it may wound those muscles which naturally antagonise each other. In this case, the relaxation -of one set of muscles implies the tension of another, and an intermediate position, or state of semiflexion is that which, upon the whole, offers perhaps the greatest advantage. We .are under great obligations to Mr. Pott for having drawn the

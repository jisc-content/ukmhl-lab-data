TROPICAL DYSENTERY. 557 be excited, it commences in general with much of the appear- ance of a common diarrhoea, occasional griping pains in the bowels, frequent and unseasonable calls to stool, with an irre- sistible inclination to strain over it. The evacuations aie in general copious, at first of a fluid consistence, and without any peculiar fetor ; they are sometimes streaked with blood, and at other times a small quantity of blood is voided in a sepa- rate form, unmixed with the faecal matter. The pulse in this early stage of the disease is seldom altered, the heat of skin but little increased, and the tongue little, il at all, changed in its appearance. The patient soon begins to complain of fixed pain in the hypogastrium, more or less acute, sometimes peculiarly urgent in one or both iliac regions; and often to be traced along the whole course of the colon.

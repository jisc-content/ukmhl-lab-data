MILITARY SUROERY. 32K of the peritoneum ; to which last occurrence, it has been stated, that nine-tenths of the deaths of those wounded in the belly is to be attributed, exclusively of those who perish from inter- nal haemorrhage. To account for this inflammation, the wound itself is now held to be sufficient, without having re- course to the action of the external air, which was formerly so much dreaded by surgeons, but which, in consequence of the complete occupation of the cavity by its natural contents, and in many cases the limited extent of the w'ound, is pre- cluded from entering in any considerable quantity. When wounds of the belly are not attended with the pro- trusion of any of the viscera, or the escape of any of the fluids or excrementitious matters contained in the abdomen, it is often a matter of doubt whether such wounds have actually laid open the cavity, and great anxiety is manifested by the patient or his friends to ascertain this fact; an anxiety, how- ever, which no prudent surgeon will attempt to gratify by much probing, or by the preposterous expedient of throwing in injections, which have been proposed as a means of ascer- taining this point. The most prominent symptoms of wounds of the abdominal viscera are, a weak and feeble pulse, great prostration of strength, tension of the abdomen, hiccup and vomiting ; all of which symptoms may indeed occur, in ir- ritable or nervous habits, even when a wound of the abdomen does not penetrate the cavity ; but when these symptoms continue for any length of time to harass the patient, there is too much reason to suppose that the abdomen has been opened, and this is often rendered, certain by the super- vention of a particular train of symptoms, marking not only the injury of the organs within, but marking also, by the na- ture of the discharges, the particular organ wounded. In wounds of the stomach, hiccup and bloody vomiting are for the most part prominent symptoms ; while discharges of blood with the farces or the urine, both of which are in general

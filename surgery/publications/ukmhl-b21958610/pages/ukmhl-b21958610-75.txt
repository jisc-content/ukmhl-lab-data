55 ACCOMMODATION OF TROOTS. while it effectually prevents the entrance ol snow or rain. By this direct and perfect communication of all the passages with the external atmosphere, as well as with each other, a constant supply of pure and unrespired air will exist within the building. To place the passages thus prepared in action as ventilators, there should be placed over each of the doors opening from them into the adjoining apartments, a Venetian window reaching to the ceiling, while the door itself should not reach within an inch of the floor ; but the principal dependance for a uniform supply of air should rest on means independent of the ordinary openings, and may be effected in the following manner. Into each room, on a level with the floor, let aper- tures be made of six or eight inches diameter, and from ten to fifteen feet distant from each other, communicating with the passage or main air-trunk ; and the same description and number of apertures are .to be made close to the ceiling cor- responding with the unbored spaces of the lower range of air- holes, it being observed that this upper row of perforations must be conducted through the exterior wall of the building, communicating directly with the external air, and so disposed as to prevent the access of rain or snow. By this means we provide for a constant supply of unrespired air from the pas- sages or reservoirs by means of the lower range of perforations, while the respired and heated air is permitted to escape by the upper range. In a room thus ventilated, the inhabitants are not exposed to direct currents of wind striking upon their bodies, for the entrance of the fresh air is below their sleeping places, while the exit of the foul air is above their heads. The heated and rarefied air escapes upwards, while that which is rendered spe- cifically heavier by the accumulation of carbonic acid gas, and which consequently occupies the lower part of the room, will be constantly diluted and refreshed with unrespired air; in- deed the more the atmosphere of an apartment thus venti-

MILITARY SURGERY. 26G the wound or puncture of an artery, and, in the circumscribed form, is often occasioned in the following manner. When pressure has been made in the first instance, so as to suppress the haunorrhage, but the bandage has afterwards been remov- ed too soon, before the artery has healed, the blood passes through the unclosed wound into the cellular substance. As this has now become agglutinated by the preceding pressure, the blood cannot diffuse itself into its cells, and, consequently, a mass of it collects in the vicinity of the aperture in the ar- tery, and distends the cellular substance into the form of a sac. Sometimes, though not often, this circumscribed false aneurism originates immediately after the opening is made in the artery. This chiefly happens when the aperture in the vessel is exceedingly small, and, consequently, when the hae- morrhage takes place so slowly, that the blood which is first effqsed coagulates, and prevents the entrance of that which follows into the cells of the cellular membrane, and of course its diffusion. Of this species of aneurism numerous examples occur from punctured wounds. The diffuse form of traumatic aneurism has, in those in- stances in which I have seen it, been accompanied with fracture of the bone and extensive injury to the limb ; has in fact been generally occasioned by a laceration or wound of the artery from some prominent point of bone, and followed by extensive disorganization of the soft parts. Besides the forms of cir- cumscribed and diffused, which the traumatic aneurism pos- sesses in common with others, it admits of two very remark- able varieties originating from the circumstance of the wound in the artery being in some cases inflicted through a superin- cumbent vein ; and one consequence of this, described by au- thors, is the formation of a circumscribed false aneurism, or encysted bloody tumour, in the cellular membrane lying be- tween the artery and vein, communicating by one aperture with the artery below, and by another with the vein above.

2 MILITARY SURGERY. has existed from a very ancient date, and which it seems to me too much the inclination of the present day to abolish. A superiority in either of these provinces must, in a great measure, result from a knowledge of the same principles. Yet at the same time each of them will probably be carried farther when separately patronised by different institutions, and practised by different individuals. This, indeed, seems to accord with the decisions of experience; for of those who have arrived at singular eminence in either of these arts, few have chosen to invade the province of the other. “ Ches- elden did not prescribe in a fever, nor did Radcliffe under- take an amputation.'1'’ But if there is any one position in which it is impossible to adopt a minute division of profes- sional labour, it is in the position of an army surgeon ; it will readily be seen how inexpedient it would be to have our ar- mies furnished with a host of followers in the shape of phy- sicians, surgeons, accoucheurs, dentists, oculists, and aurists, calculated, in times of difficulty, to increase all the privations of an army, and leading, in the day of battle, to inextricable confusion. It is not, however, in a combination of the two great branches of the profession that the essence of military surgery consists, so much as in the peculiarity of the circumstances in which they fall to be exercised; and it is not perhaps more in the surgical than in the medical division of the subject that this peculiarity exists. Military Surgery may be consi- dered as a judicious application of all the subdivisions of the healing art to those varied circumstances in which soldiers arc placed both in health and in sickness. “ Ce n’est pas toutefois une science distinctc, ni meme une branche parti- culiere de Fart de guerir, mais une application raisonnee de toutes les parties de cet art aux circonstances variees dans lcsquelles se trouvent les homines de guerre, taut en saute qu’en maladie.'1

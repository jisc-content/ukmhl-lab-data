MILITARY SURGERY. 33G an anxiety to ascertain precisely the nature anil extent of tht? injury sustained ; nor is such anxiety to he altogether repro- bated. When the viscera are wounded without protruding, and when the wound in the abdominal parietes is sufficient to admit the point of the surgeonâ€™s finger, this, of all others, forms the most manageable and most instructive instrument of research. But in lesions of the less fixed and floating, or tubular viscera, of which we come now to speak, such lesions arc not unfrequently accompanied with protrusion of the in- jured bowel, rendering the nature of the case obvious. Protrusions indeed often happen through wounds of the abdo- minal parietes without any mechanical injury to the protruded part; and of parts liable to such protrusion, the omentum, from its situation and extent, is the most so, and next to this the small intestines. It is worthy of remark, that in fat subjects portions of the adipose membrane sometimes become entangled in the lips of the wound, and are liable to be mistaken for omentum. When parts protrude through a narrow wound, they are liable to become strangulated, inflamed, and gangre- nous, as in cases of hernia ; and the natural practice in cases of protruded omentum, where the protrusion is recent, is to return it as speedily as possible to its natural situation within the abdomen, r.ot losing time in fomenting the protruded parts previous to their return, a practice advised by some authors, without recollecting, that no fomentation whatever can possi- bly be so beneficial as the natural warmth and moisture of the abdominal cavity. In facilitating the reduction of protruded parts, whether of omentum or intestine, we find the advantage of relaxing the abdominal muscles as completely as possible. When it becomes necessary to enlarge the opening in tire abdominal parietes for the reduction of protruded parts, this may be done with a director and curved bistoury, carrying the incision as far as possible parallel to the muscular fibres, anti in such a direction as to avoid crossing the course of the epi-

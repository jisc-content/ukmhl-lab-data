MILITARY SURGERY. 510 these by no means uncommon, the urethra is contracted for per- haps an inch or more of its extent, its coats being often irregu- larly thickened, and forming a tortuous canal. Sometimes, also, we meet with two distinct strictures within an inch of each other, and the whole intermediate space somewhat contracted. When the contraction is not considerable, it appears, on exa- mination after death, to be merely a narrowing of the urethra; but a permanent stricture, in a more advanced state, usually forms a distinct projection into the canal, and the diseased portion of the tube acquires an almost cartilaginous, hardness. With regard to the alleged mixed kind of stricture, partly spas- modic and partly organic, I shall merely observe, that w'hile I do not deny the possibility of a stricture in the posterior part of the urethra being acted upon by the powerful muscles sur- rounding it, I must profess my belief, that when an organic stricture is situated in the fore part of the tube, and when a portion of the canal in this situation has become indurated and callous, it is little capable of being influenced by the spasmodic contraction of muscular fibres so feeble as to render their very existence doubtful, and that all obstructions in this part of the passage from spasm are hypothetical. To enumerate all the peculiar sensations and symptoms, both local and constitutional, to which strictures occasionally give rise, w'ould lead me into an endless detail; I shall therefore content myself with noticing the more prominent. It is seldom that a patient suspects the existence of stric- ture till he observes his urine made in a very minute stream, and incapable of being forced from him without a very un- usual effort. The diminution of the stream comes on so slowly and gradually, that he forgets what it is to make water freely. When the disease is somewhat advanced, the urine is voided in a spiral, irregular, scattered, or forked stream, and sometimes only in drops. It occasionally hap- pens that the disease is altogether overlooked, until the pa-

40 MILITARY SURGERY. The practice of breakfasting on tea or coffee has lately been commenced in many regiments, and it is hoped will become gene- ral in the army, as the comfort and advantages of this practice are, I believe, admitted by all who have thought upon the subject. It was one of the prophylactic measures recom- mended by the distinguished physicians sent to the assis- tance of the troops at Walcheren in 1809, and of its benefi- cial effects upon the health of soldiers under particular circum- stances, I witnessed a remarkable instance while surgeon of the 33d regiment.

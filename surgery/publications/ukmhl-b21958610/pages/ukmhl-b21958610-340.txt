320 military surgery. cause were much akin to those entertained by Dr. Henncii on his first entering the service, and my own experience in the treatment of wounds of the lungs has led me to the same conclusions which he has drawn. It may however be very naturally and very justly ob- served, that if emphysema occurs but in one case of fifty, we must in such case be prepared to meet it. When in consequence of wounds in the lungs, the air escaping from these organs does not find a ready exit by the external wound, it either accumulates within the sac of the pleura, compresses the corresponding lung, impedes the respiration, and constitutes the disease properly termed pneumothorax; or, finding its way into the cellular membrane, it becomes gradually diffused in the neighbourhood of the wound, con- stituting what is more strictly termed emphysema. This sometimes extends over the whole body, being naturally most liable to accumulate in those parts where the cellular mem- brane is most lax, permeable, and destitute of fat. Hence we find the eyelids, the throat, and scrotum distended to an enormous size, while other parts of the body, particularly the palms of the hands, and soles of the feet, where the air is un- able to overcome the more firm connexion between the skin and subjacent parts, scarcely at all affected; and this partial exemption from swelling, instead of tending to preserve any degree of symmetry in the general appearance, only renders the deformity of face and of figure so much the more remark- able. In extreme cases of general emphysema, the natural contour is altogether lost, and the patient resembles anything but a human being; by tbe great distension of the skin, the body is rendered almost quite rigid and immoveable, and the pressure of the accumulated air on the organs of respira- tion, brings on a sense of suffocation almost insupportable. Of the severity of this suffering some estimate may be formed from the cases mentioned by Sauvage and by Littre. In one of

563 TROPICAL DYSENTERY. in which the result has been fatal, the appearances on dissection have been such as to excite a sentiment of regret at not hav- ing carried the evacuation farther. I am now indeed satisfied, that in the cases of dysentery which occurred in the Royals on our first arrival in India, blood-letting was not practised to a sufficient extent. The prejudices against it at that time ex- isting in India, and the state of our men’s constitutions, after a voyage of full five months without having touched anywhere for refreshments, were circumstances which restrained us, more than they ought to have done, from the use of this evacuation; but that the utility of this remedy may not rest, either up- on any acknowledged error of mine in its omission, or upon any conjectural opinion in its favour, I beg leave to quote the following passages from Mr. Bampfield’s essay. “ From the history and explanation of the symptoms, causes, and consequences of this disease, the reader will hardly be prepared to learn, that the propriety of bleeding in tropical dysentery should be questioned ; that a large proportion of me- dical practitioners in both Indies, not only discountenance the practice, but have never employed the remedy ; and influen- ced by them and long established practice or usage, many of the old European inhabitants are prejudiced strongly against it. Hence, its recommendation must rest on its merits and utility, and its employment be sanctioned only by its efficiency. I am able to prove its utility in tropical dysentery by the cases annexed; and I hope to vindicate the principles on which it is employed, by establishing a particular identity of some symptoms in dysentery and enteritis, which are characteristic of intestinal inflammation, and a further analogy between it and inflammation of other viscera possessed of secreting mem- branes, when peculiar functions differ from the intestinal. My experience justifies the employment of it in dysentery, and it should be laid down as a rule of practice, that venesection should be early and universally employed in all cases of dy-

They may either supervene immediately after the accident, or come on at a more remote period, according as the pressure is induced by the immediate depression of the bone, or by tbe gradual effusion and accumulation of fluids within the skull ; and this will again be more or less rapid as it proceeds from a ruptured vessel of greater or less calibre, or as it results from an accumulation of matter in consequence of suppuration. The symptoms of compression are in a great measure the same as those which have already been enumerated as indicat- ing the first stage of concussion, and they are nearly allied to those enumerated by medical writers, as characteristic of apo- plexy. In severe cases, every circumstance concurs to denote insensibility,—the patient lies in a state of stupor,—his limbs relaxed as if recently dead,—he evinces no feeling of pain, nor is it possible to rouse him, or induce him to answer questions,— the pulse is slow and oppressed,—the pupils of the eyes dilated ; and the iris insensible to the stimulus even of a strong light,— the breathing is laborious, slow, and stertorous,—the faces and urine often escape involuntarily, and the patient is some- times paralytic in one or more members, the paralysis existing on the side opposite to that on which the injury has been sustain- ed. From this it will be seen that no very marked criterion ex- ists between the symptoms of concussion of the brain and those of compression, and the diagnosis is to be drawn, not so much from any intrinsic difference in these symptoms as from acci- dental circumstances. It may be remarked in general, that concussion supervenes more immediately after the accident, and is more transitory in its nature, while compression in many cases supervenes later, and is more permanent. In military practice, the causes of concussion are comparatively less frequent, while the causes ol

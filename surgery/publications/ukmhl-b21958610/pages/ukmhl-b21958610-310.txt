Of this, instances are noticed in Dr. Thomson’s report of the state of the wounded in Belgium, af- ter the battle of Waterloo; and there are several wounds of the cranium figured in the first edition of Hennen's Military Surgery, in which reunion has obviously taken place, after wTounds of this description. I may also refer to a case of very old date, which is quoted from Berengarius by Mr. John Bell, and which he brings forward, in order to found upon it a very unjust piece of criticism on Mr. Meinors, a surgeon at Birmingham, who was the first, in this country, to advo- cate the practice of laying down the scalp after the operation of trepan. There are some circumstances worthy of notice, which fa- vour reunion of the scalp, as for instance, when a flap of the integuments of the cranium is raised from above downwards, or from the coronal towards the basilar aspect of the skull, so as to leave the principal nutritient vessels undivided, it lives and reunites more readily, than when detached in an opposite direction ; and it will readily be understood that re- union is more or less easily accomplished, in proportion as the base of a raised portion of the scalp is more or less extend- ed. When a wound is very extensive or irregular in shape, it is sometimes necessary to have recourse to stitches, for the

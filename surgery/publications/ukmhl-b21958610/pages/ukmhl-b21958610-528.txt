MILITARY SURGERY. 508 stricture at the distance of from six to seven inches from the external orifice, but in every part of the canal anterior to this I have occasionally met with strictures, and have not found them so generally confined to the situation of three inches and a half, or four inches and a half from the external orifice, as Sir Everard would lead us to suppose. Mr. Shaw, in a se- cond paper on the subject of strictures, in the twelfth volume of the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, asserts, that in more than a hundred dissections which he has made of diseases of the urethra, he has never seen a stricture or narrowing of the canal posterior to the ligament of the bulb ; nor has he been able to find one example of stricture beyond this part, among those preserved in the college museum. In almost all cases where a narrow stricture has existed for some time at the liga- ment of the bulb, or in any part of the urethra anterior to this, the membranous and prostatic portions are dilated beyond their natural size ; and when such a stricture as causes occa- sional retention of urine lias existed for some years, the blad- der is found to be not only thickened, but often at the same time sacculated. Strictures are generally attributed to the effects of gonor- rhoea, or to the use of astringent injections in its cure; and it cannot be denied that injections used in the inflam- matory stage of gonorrhoea are calculated to produce this disease, as arc also all irritations in the canal, from whatever source, as excess of venery, abuse of stimulants, stone in the bladder, &c. How variously these irritations will operate upon different individuals, according to the natural suscepti- bility of the urethra, may be in some measure learned from what was said when speaking of the strength of injections for gonorrhoea, and also from certain phenomena occurring in the treatment of strictures. On the introduction of a bougie, many people experience very little pain or uneasiness ; in others, this operation is attended with great pain, irritation, and con-

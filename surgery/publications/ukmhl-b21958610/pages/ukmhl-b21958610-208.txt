MILITARY SURGERY. 18Â« portant fact, that a great diminution in the number and in- tractable character of the ulcers prevalent in the navy has lat- terly taken place, which is attributed to improvements in the ventilation and cleanliness of the ships ; to more advantage- ous accommodation for the sick ; to improved diet, with more regular supplies of vegetables ; and to increased professional at- tention ; to which it would seem, from one of the reports, that the naval surgeons were, in some measure, roused in conse- quence of the trial by a court-martial of the surgeon of the Salvador del Mundo, on charges connected with the prevalence of ulcers in his ship. With regard to what has long been known in the navy as the Malignant ulcer, its more success- ful management is very generally attributed to the adoption of the antiphlogistic mode of treatment; and the naval surgeons almost uniformly concur in assigning the merit of this im- provement to Dr. Baird, the Inspector of Naval Hospitals. This leads me to observe, that one of the most marked dis- tinctions between the Scorbutic and Malignant ulcer is, that the former is incident to seamen or soldiers whose constitutions have been impaired by long confinement on ship-board and unwholesome diet, or to sepoys and lascars, whose vital powers are comparatively feeble ; and that it is most suc- cessfully combated by improved diet and relaxation on shore ; while the other, whether termed hospital gangrene or malig- nant ulcer, appears as an inflammatory disease, and is most successfully treated by bleeding and antiphlogistic remedies. Such appears to me to be the legitimate inference from the history and treatment of hospital gangrene, as detailed in the writings of the most experienced surgeons; and to the sum- mary which has now been given, my own observation docs not enable me to make any important addition. When a pupil at the Royal Infirmary here, twenty-five years ago, there were some cases of ill-conditioned sores which were spoken of as cases of hospital gangrene; but at this distance of time I do

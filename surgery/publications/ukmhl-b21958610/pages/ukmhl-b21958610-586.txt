MILITARY SURGERY. 5GG which, with some practitioners, seems to me to claim an undue shareof attention. The quantity of the medicine to be exhibited must vary greatly in different individuals; it is always to be carried the length of producing considerable ptyalism; and this, wherever the exhaustion of the patient does not forbid it, is to be kept up without intermission until natural secretions return, and the stools resume a healthy appearance. For the profuse salivations, which many suppose necessary, I have never heard any good reason assigned; while the relaxation and debility of the patient, partly induced by the medicine, and partly by its rendering him incapable of taking the little sustenance to which he might otherwise be inclined, seem very strong objec- tions to this practice. Upon the various auxiliary and topical means employed in the treatment of dysentery, I cannot now enlarge; they chiefly consist of purgatives, sudorifics, warm bath, topical bleed- ing by leeches, blisters, and injections. The various circum- stances in which these are indicated, and the various symp- toms they are calculated to relieve, will readily suggest them- selves ; but I cannot help remarking, that, from the view I take of the topical nature of the colonitis or acute form of flux, I am induced to attach a very considerable importance to topical remedies, particularly to leeching, blisters, and in- jections. And I conclude by again observing, that, in order to establish a rational and discriminating mode of treatment in dysentery, we must ever hold in view the leading distinc- tions in its nature, which it has been a principal object of these remarks to point out.

MILITARY SURGERY. 4*46 well-timed bleeding, the disease is more effectually sub- dued, and the cure accomplished with much less expenditure of blood, and less injury to the system, than by repeated bleedings to a smaller extent; and there can be no doubt that in consequence of the encouragement which was at one time given to repeated general bleedings, many constitutions have been injured, and the cure, in many instances, ultimately pro- tracted. Wherever a subsequent evacuation of blood becomes necessary, it will, for the most part, be taken with greater ad- vantage from the temporal artery, the jugular vein, or by leeches from the immediate neighbourhood of the eye. Whenever the violence of the attack, and the robust habit of the patient, induces us to resort to general bleeding, it is desirable to carry it at once ad deliquium, or to produce a com- plete remission of the pain. The quantity of blood requisite for this purpose varies greatly in different individuals. The ave- rage quantity, as stated by Dr. Vetch, is from thirty to forty ounces, and in speaking of inflammation, the case of a young soldier affected with opththalmia was formerly noticed, in which fifty-two ounces were withdrawn while the patient stood erect with a vein opened in each arm. But it is only when employed within the first forty-eight hours of the existence of the disease, that bleedings to this extent prove either ef- fectual or safe ; beyond this period they make comparative- ly little impression on the eye, while they produce an inju- rious effect on the system, and lead to a tedious convalescence. When we have an opportunity of witnessing the effects of bleeding on the vessels of the conjunctiva, we may sometimes observe the redness disappear during the operation, a con- vincing proof of the impression made on the disease ; and the temporary suspension of the force of the circulation during syncope proves always beneficial.

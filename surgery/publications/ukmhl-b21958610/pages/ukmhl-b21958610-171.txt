BURNS. 151 in the slighter cases of burns, its employment, from the cold- ness alone, is highly gratifying to the feelings of the patient. But in more severe cases, where the cuticle is detached, the smarting produced by the application is often so great as to render it intolerable. A common domestic remedy for burns, in this country, is the application of a pulp of raw potatoes, formed by scraping or grating them down, and applying them in the form of a cataplasm ; an application in which no virtue resides, beyond that of its cooling effect. Stimulating applications have also been long in use, both by scientific and empirical practitioners; and of this class, one of the most ancient, one of the most vaunted, and perhaps one of the least employed, is the application of heat. This is a prescription as old as the time of Aristotle ; and “ of all the hot and attractive things,” says Pare, “ which, by ra- rifying, drawing out, and dissolving, assuage the pain and heat of combustion, the fire challengeth the first place, espe- cially when the burning is small.” This practice of employing extraneous heat for the cure of burns, has also been recom- mended by Wiseman, who observes, that by holding a burn- ing hot iron to the part, the “ fire calls forth that fire it made ; omne simile, simili gaudet; vel similem sibi trahit; ignis ipse esl sui ipsius alexiteriumi'1 Hcister, Van Sweiten, and various other writers, give their opinions in favour of the same practice; but all these high authorities have weighed but little against the pain and suffering which the practice ne- cessarily implies, and it has therefore never been employed to any considerable extent. Applications, however, so far analo- gous to this as to excite severe pain by their application, and to stimulate the burnt surface, have been recommended by numerous writers. Of these the most remarkable arc alcohol, and spiritous applications, in favour of which we have the tes- timony of Sydenham, and, in later times, that of Lombard, in his “ Clinique des Plaics par armes a feu,” where he urges

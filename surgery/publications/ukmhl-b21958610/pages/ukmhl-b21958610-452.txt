MILITARY SURGERY. 432 Journal. Mr. Mackesey very candidly admits, that a single experiment of this kind is totally insufficient to establish a point of so much practical importance, and his experiment is completely neutralized by one stated to me by Deputy-In- spector Marshall, who observes :—“ I applied a portion of the purulent matter which was obtained from a man labouring under epidemic ophthalmia in the 89th regiment, to the eyes of four persons, including myself, and the disease followed in two of the individuals.” Amongst the opinions in favour of the non-contagious na- ture of the disease is to be reckoned that of Baron Larrey, who, I am informed, ridicules the idea of the disease being propagated by contagion. It is doubtful, however, whether the Baron has ever seen the disease under those circum- stances which have so generally impressed the British sur- geons with an opinion of its contagious nature. We may observe, that it was not in Egypt, where many causes exist calculated to produce the disease, that the opinion of its con- tagious character was chiefly impressed upon the medical men of this country. And although it is true that many French soldiers who escaped the disease in Egypt were suddenly struck blind on returning home, yet this is expressly stated by Baron Larrey himself to have arisen, in his opinion, from “ a paralysis of the organ of vision, induced by a sudden change from the hot climate of Egypt to that of France in the cold- est season of the yearand we have no account, so far as I know, of its subsequent occurrence in the French army in such a shape as to cause general alarm, or to invalid almost whole regiments, as it has unfortunately done in the British service. But it may be observed, that throughout this discussion I have uniformly employed the word “contagion,” and wish it to be understood according to its strict etymology, implying a disease only to be communicated by the actual contact of morbid matter, and not capable of being propagated through

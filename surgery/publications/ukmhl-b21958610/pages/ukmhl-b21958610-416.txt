MILITAHY SUROERY. o‘)G it is easily replaced, by extending the knee-joint, bending the limb upon the trunk at the hip-joint, so as to relax the extensor muscles, and then pressing upon the outer edge of’ the patella, and elevating its inner edge over the condyle of the femur. In some cases, however, where this mode of pro- ceeding has not been successful, the dislocated patella has been reduced by bending the knee to the utmost. This was mentioned to me by a gentleman wrho attended my class last year, as a mode of proceeding with which he was familiar, but I confess it was quite new to me when brought to the notice of the profession two years ago by Mr. Mayo and Mr. Broughton of the Life-Guards, who adopted it in the ease of a soldier of his regiment whose patella had been dislocated in consequence of being “ struck sharply on the right knee by the knee of another soldier, as, in the exercises, two opposite lines rode through each other."’ The views which induced the gentlemen concerned to adopt the expedient of bending the knee are given at length in the second volume of the Medical Gazette, where the case is detailed, and the following was the result, “ the patient w’as laid upon the left side, and his right ankle was grasped by a comrade, who, when we bade him, suddenly carried the heel back to the hip, thus bending the knee to the utmost. This motion was hardly completed when the patella audibly returned into its socket.” The patella, from a similar accident to that which hap- pened to Mr. Broughton’s patient, has been known to under- go “ a semirevolution on its own axis, its inner edge resting fixed in the trochlea, between the condyles of the femur, the outer projecting directly forwards.” A case of this kind oc- curred within these few days to a private in the Queen’s Bays, now in the cavalry barracks here, and was speedily re- duced. From the case of a private in the Prussian hussars, which is detailed in Rust’s Magazine, it would appear that

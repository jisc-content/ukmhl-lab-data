WOUNDS OF THE HEAD. 295 subject to any chronic infirmity, or in habitual drunkards liable to delirium tremens. The use of antimonials in cases of concussion was much insisted on by some of the French writers, and is now become a very common practice. Desault remarks, that whether the medicine acted as an emetic, produced a copious perspiratiou, or operated by stool, its effects were found to be equally bene- ficial, and much of its salutary operation was ascribed not merely to_ the evacuations procured, but to its producing a counter-irritation and excitement in parts distant from the head. Upon this principle of exciting counter-irritation, the applica- tion of blisters to the scalp is not unfrequently employed by surgeons in the inflammatory stage of concussion, but it has always appeared to me, that the vessels on the outside of the skull which we wish to excite, and those on the inside of it, the action of which we wish to allay, are too nearly contiguous, and too intimately connected by anastomosis, particularly in young subjects, to enable us to produce upon them effects directly opposite. Are not the beneficial effects of cold lotions, and ice bladders to the head, so commonly resorted to in cases of phrenitis, directly at variance with the principles upon which blisters are recommended ? Do not the cold applica- tions which I have mentioned operate by repressing the inor- dinate action of the vessels, both without and within the skull ? And is it not upon this principle, the speedy evaporation and consequent cold, that the application of ether to the fore- head and temples is found sometimes to relieve a headach ? The injury to the brain, which is strictly termed concus- sion, when not fatal, is always of a temporary and transient na- ture ; and it is the inflammatory disposition succeeding to it, or what, according to some writers, constitutes the second stage of concussion, which ought to be the chief object of anxiety and interest to the surgeon. Compression of the brain again is of a more permanent cha-

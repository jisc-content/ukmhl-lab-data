TROPICAL DYSENTERY. 551 In concluding these observations, I may be permitted to reiterate my opinion, that the yellow fever is nothing more than a highly concentrated form of the marsh remittent; that the yellowness of the skin and black vomit, which have been supposed peculiarly to characterise this fever, are accidental and adventitious symptoms, not supervening, for the most part, until the patient is beyond the reach of medicine, and therefore unfit to guide our practice. In fine, I consider this fever, whether raging on the coast of Java or on the shores of St. Domingo, whether at Seringapatam, at Gibraltar, or at Walcheren, as essentially of the same nature ; its symptoms, its dangers, and its treatment alike, and that this treatment will be most successful when it is most calculated to lessen high vascular action, to subdue local inflammation, and to ob- viate the disorganization of important organs. TROPICAL DYSENTERY. This disease has from the most remote ages been looked upon as one of the principal scourges of an army, both in temperate and in tropical climates. In Sir John Pringle’s work on the diseases of the army, we have an account of the dysentery as it occurred in his time; and for a detail of its extensive ra- vages in the Peninsular army, I would refer to Sir James M‘Grigor’s paper on the health of that army, so frequently quoted in the introductory part of the course. From the de- tails there given, it would appear, that in a period of thirty- one months, from December 1811 to June 1814, nearly 23,000 cases of dysentery and diarrhoea occurred, and that dysentery

In regulating the diet of wounded patients, too much caution cannot be exercised, particularly in cases of wounds of the head. Independent of the abuse of food, daily experience shows, that even its moderate use is sometimes highly detri- mental. It has not unfrequently happened, that patients who have undergone great privations, combined with exposure to cold, have manifested no dangerous symptoms until taken in- to hospitals, where their wants have been supplied ; and many soldiers have lost their lives, by a childish facility of the younger surgeons, in allowing them what are termed extras,—a fre- quent cause of protracted illness, and a source of endless abuse in hospitals. Various definitions have been given of a wound, and various objections have been made to all of them. It is therefore, per- haps, a hopeless task to attempt a definition at once sufficient- ly concise, and, at the same time, so comprehensive, as to embrace every circumstance in accidents so complicated ; but to those who are more eager to acquire practical information than to quarrel with the imperfection of language, the follow- ing definition will, perhaps, be received as sufficient for every useful purpose. “ A recent solution of continuity, extending through one or more textures, and occasioned, for the most partj by external violence.” Such solutions of continuity may be occasioned by the mechanical action of all foreign bodies, which are harder than the texture of our organs; and as the number of such bodies is infinite, and the texture and functions of parts exposed to injury various, it will readily be understood, that an endless difference exists in the nature, the ex- tent, and the danger of wounds. To facilitate the study of this branch of surgery, systematic authors have, from the

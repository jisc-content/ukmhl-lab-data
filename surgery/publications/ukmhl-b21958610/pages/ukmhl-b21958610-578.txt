The more chronic form of disease, termed hepatic flux, of which the complaint above described is sometimes a precursor, is more particularly incident to men after being some time resident in India, and more frequently attacks those who, from habit and constitution, are less liable to violent inflammatory affections, but more prone to irregular and disordered secretions of bile.

MILITARY SURGERY. 360 seen projecting from the wound, and on drawing it gently, a portion of several inches separated without any ha:morrhage. This case is very much to our present purpose, as it tends to show, that when mortification or sloughing occurs, from what- ever cause, the arteries are sometimes involved in it, even to a greater extent than the contiguous parts, and when the slough is not prematurely forced off, the trunks of the vessels which have been injured by a gunshot wound are in general perma- nently closed before its separation. On the removal of sloughs, a little blood may occasionally be lost, but it is generally caused by the impatience of the surgeon, or the irregularity of the patient, and seldom requires much attention. Sometimes from about the 8th to the 20th day, a large artery will give way, but the pnqiortion of cases requiring the ligature of arteries from secondary haemorrhage, is stated by Mr. Guthrie, I believe with great truth, not to exceed three or four in a thousand, exclusive of haemorrhage from hospital gangrene, inordinate sloughing, or broken bones ; and he concludes, “ that the opinion, that gunshot wounds do not bleed at the moment of infliction, unless a very large artery be cut, and that they generally bleed, and often pro- fusely, after suppuration, cannot be too soon banished from the minds of surgeons, as leading to unnecessary anxiety and bad practice.” But however urgent injuries of the arterial vessels may be, the first danger is generally the greatest, and if this is once obviated, cases most unpromising in their appearance arc often conducted to a favourable termination. The case how- ever is widely different with gunshot wounds of the extremities, complicated with broken bones, and a large proportion of such wounds arc cases for the immediate removal of the limb. But before specifying those more particularly, or entering farther into the consideration of gunshot fractures, I would ofler a few remarks on those fractures of the limbs occurring from

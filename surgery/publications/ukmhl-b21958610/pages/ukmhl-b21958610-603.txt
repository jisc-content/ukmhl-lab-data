583 FEIGNED AND FACTITIOUS DISEASES. ally coloured with various pigments. In a case detailed to me by Mr. Guthrie, and subsequently noticed in his work on the arteries, a soldier resorted to the very desperate expedi- ent of swallowing a piece ol cork stuck full ot pins, which in the first instance produced copious hemoptysis or hemateme- sis, and ultimately death by wounding the carotid artery. The most obvious circumstances demanding attention in sus- picious cases are the character of the sputa, the presence or absence of fever, and the usual characteristics of real hemop- tysis, with a rigid and frequent examination of the patient s mouth. Dysentery and Diarrhoea. Wherever these diseases arc prevalent in an army, we have individuals occasionally assum- ing them for the purpose of evading duty. The symptoms are readily learned from patients actually labouring under them, and dysenteric evacuations are not unfrequently borrow- ed for the purpose of deception. Mucous evacuations are said to be occasionally produced by introducing suppositories of soap, or of more acrid matters into the rectum, and blood is sometimes artificially mixed with the stools. Bowel complaints are stated by Mr. Hutchison to have been artifi- cially produced amongst the seamen by the employment of vinegar and burnt cork ; the rationale of this process I am not able to explain, but I may remark that all feigned bowel-complaints arc for the most part easily detected by secluding the suspected individual, debarring him from access to the means of carrying on the imposture, and compelling him to use a close stool, so as to be satisfied about the nature of his evacuations. Incontinence of Urine has been very frequently feigned by soldiers and seamen. It is stated to have been a very fre- quent complaint amongst the French conscripts during the wars of Napoleon, and upon some occasions it has appeared like an epidemic in our own service, as in the instance of a

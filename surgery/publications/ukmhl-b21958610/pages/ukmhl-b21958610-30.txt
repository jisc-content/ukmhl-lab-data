Amongst those who have successfully cultivated and ex- tended the boundaries of military surgery in France, I would claim particular attention to one of their earlier writers, Ambrose Pare, who was successively surgeon to four kings of France, and who followed the French armies in all their cam- paigns from 1536 down to the battle of Moncontour in 1569.

To Pare, also, we are indebted for the introduction of the needle and ligature, an improvement in the art of surgery, for which the name of its inventor will ever be respected.

When he was brought to quarters, his mas-

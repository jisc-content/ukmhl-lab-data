WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 3C1 more ordinary causes, and which are usually divided, with reference to the contiguous soft parts, into simple and com- pound, with reference to the bones, into transverse, oblique, and comminuted. Tim reunion of a fractured bone is accomplished by a pro- cess in some respects analogous to that by which the soft parts are reunited, and it is necessary to observe, that with the suc- cessful conduct of this process, either a very high or a very low degree of inflammatory action is equally inconsistent. From a knowledge of the first circumstance, an argument has been drawn for deferring the setting, or as it was formerly termed, the coaptation of a broken bone, until the inflammation super- vening after the accident shall have in a great measure sub- sided ; from the latter circumstance, namely, a deficiency of inflammatory action, we have sometimes to deplore the total want of reunion, and the formation of an artificial joint, to remedy which, much ingenuity has been exercised, and vari- ous expedients adopted, to which I shall immediately advert. The whole process of the reunion of a broken bone,—the effusion first of blood round its extremities, the subsequent swelling and inflammation of the periosteum and surround- ing muscles, the effusion of the provisional and permanent callus, the deposition of osseous matter, which, in the cylin- drical bones, is found to occupy the medullary cavity contigu- ous to the fracture, and, finally, the reopening of this cavity, by the action of the absorbents, are all processes highly deserv- ing attention ; but for a more minute account of these I must refer to other sources. I enumerate these different steps only to show, that from the receipt of the injury to the accom- plishment of the cure, a scries of operations is continually going forward, which may be greatly retarded, or altogether prevented, by improper treatment, and which can only be ex- pedited by the due approximation of the fractured portions of bpnc, by employing the means best adapted to retain them in ■i

205 INCISED WOUNDS. other wounds, in which cures were effected by the use of appropriate bandages without the aid of sutures: M. Pi- brac concludes his observations on this subject by asking the following queries—“ What practice would the advocates for sutures adopt, were they necessitated, as they often are, to cut the ligatures and remove them ? or were they to find, as is often the case, that the ligatures had made their way through the lips of the wound, so as to leave them gaping ?”—“ they would never,” says he, “ think of introducing new sutures, but would have recourse to a bandage in order to unite the wound.” fc> Undoubtedly they would in general do so; but this mode of ar- guing against a practice from its abuse, or from its being em- ployed under unfavourable circumstances, which is by far too common in medicine, is no sufficient proof of its inutility. Although M. Pibrae and M. Louis, another eminent French surgeon, who also reprobated the use of sutures, have given us many instances of cures effected without them, it would be no difficult matter to produce an equal, or a greater num- ber of cases of wounds, in which, in the opinion of judges as competent as these eminent Frenchmen, sutures have been esteemed of the utmost importance. Much depends upon the irritability of the wounded part, much upon the natural habit of the patient, and much upon his time of life. It will readily be understood, that in parts endowed with acute sensibility, and in vigorous and inflammatory habits, it will be prudent to guard against the additional excitement which numerous stitches must necessarily occasion, and to trust the reunion of the wound to the effects of position, plaster, and bandage ; while, on the other hand, in parts naturally lax, in less irri- table habits, and in advanced life, the additional excitement occasioned by the introduction of sutures is rather conducive to the cure, by promoting the necessary adhesive inflamma- tion ; and as far as my own experience enables me to offer an opinion upon this point, I am rather disposed to extend than to

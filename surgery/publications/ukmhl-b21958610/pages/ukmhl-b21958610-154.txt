134 MILITARY SURGERY. aiul has led me to have less dread of the stimulating effects of opium than what is sometimes entertained. But while I thus attempt to obviate an objection to the use of opiate sudorifics, I must not overlook an important advantage attending another set of remedies of this class,—the antimonial diaphoretics, which, by producing nausea, and reducing the frequency and force of the pulse, as well as by opening the exhaling vessels on the surface of the body, have a most salutary effect in in- flammatory diseases. Analogous in its operation to sudorifics, and indeed a prac- tice often leading to a copious diaphoresis, is the use of the Warm Bath, a remedy always highly grateful, and, when pro- perly regulated, often attended with the most beneficial effects. The temperature of the bath should be made agreeable to the feelings of the patient, and in most cases this will be about 90 or 95 degrees. If it does not become necessary to remove the patient from the bath, in consequence of a tendency to faint, the use of this remedy ought to be prolonged farther than what it generally is in this country. Twenty minutes or half an hour is, perhaps, the shortest period in which the warm bath can be expected to produce its good effects ; and this may often be prolonged even to a whole hour, with advantage. A par- tial use of this remedy in the form of Pediluvium or Semi- cupium, by procuring an increased determination of blood to those parts to which it is applied, often produces a beneficial effect on distant parts of the body when affected with inflam- mation. It may not be altogether out of place here to re- mark, that a general and very prevalent error in this country is, to take too much of the cold and too little of the warm, bath,—to stay too long in the one and too short a time in the other. In entering upon the consideration of the Topical means for the treatment of inflammation, I scarcely consider it neces- sary to advert to the removal of those exciting causes of the

225 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 340 yards distance, and 44 men at G80 yards distance; and lie r recounts in succession the numbers likely to be wounded by f shot of different dimensions, until he comes down to an ounce i ball, which, according to his calculation, will pierce a file of 4 men, if discharged at close quarters, and with the usual degree of velocity ; this, for a cannon ball he estimates to be nearly two thousand feet in a second, and for a musket ball about seventeen hundred, at the moment of their quitting t the muzzle of the gun. Those who may be inclined to inquire more particularly into this subject, will find much assistance from a paper of Dr. Hutton’s on the initial velocity of cannon balls, and the force of fired gunpowder, in the 68th volume of the Philosophical Transactions. It is obvious, however, that these are subjects little susceptible of accurate calcu- lation ; and the velocity must vary according to the quan- tity and quality of the powder, the length of the bore, and ieven upon the state of the atmosphere through which a ball '.passes, the velocity being considerably greater in a dry state of the atmosphere than when it is loaded with vapour. But however much the artillerist and the engineer may be inter- ested in ascertaining these points with correctness, it must be confessed, as Dr. Hennen observes, “ that they lead to little improvement in surgery, except in as far as they show :the enormous violence with which the bones may be fractur- ed, and their fragments dispersed either into the medullary cavities, or into the surrounding soft parts.” After these observations on the velocity of balls, it will pro- bably surprise those unacquainted with the subject, to be told of the very trivial circumstances which are frequently found to alter their direction. In accounting for the very singular course which balls are frequently found to take, recourse is naturally had to those laws which regulate the direction of moving bodies, and to these it is now time to advert. Al- though in many cases a mathematical explanation of the course u

STRICTURES. o05 longitudinal direction.” Formerly it was believed, that either the lining of the urethra was composed of “ circular fibres,” which possessed a power of contraction, or that it was imme- diately surrounded by such fibres, and that the disease known by the name of stricture in the urethra, or at least one spe- cies of it, was produced by a contraction of some of these circular fibres ; and it is now alleged, that the lining of the urethra is never met with in a contracted state, but is thrown into folds by the action of the elastic ligamentous covering exterior to the corpus spongiosum, and the swell of the longi- tudinal muscular fibres within it. In opposition to the doctrine of the muscularity of the ure- thra, many ingenious observations are adduced by Sir Charles Bell, who contends that it is from confounding the effect of the proper muscles of the urethra that the canal itself has been imagined to possess a muscular property. “ We can be at no loss,” says he, “ to account for spasm in the posterior part of the urethra, since five inches of the canal in that situation are surrounded by muscles, the accelerator urina?, the sphincter vesicae, the compressor prostatas, and the levator ani, while it should never be forgotten, that it is the sensibility of the ure- thra which governs their contraction and he concludes, that the part of the canal anterior to these muscles has no mus- cular power. Sir. Shaw has also supported this view of the subject by some ingenious observations, in a paper inserted in the tenth volume of the Transactions of the Medico-Chir- urgical Society of London. He observes, that if the ure- thra be laid open, we sec that its inner membrane is contin- uous with the mucous coat of the bladder, that it is a secre- ting coat, and has a great many ducts opening upon its sur- face. c‘ If the pudic artery be injected with size and vermilion, the membrane will be seen to be highly vascular ; if a por- tion of the urethra be distended, and the spongy body be carefully removed, the inner membrane will appear delicate

195 WOUNDS. ■will terminate in death. In allusion to wounds ol the most limited extent, which are sometimes received in the prosecu- tion of anatomical research, a recent writer observes, “ that ^scarcely a winter passes over without some sacrifice of life to .the perilous cause which we espouse.” With a view to legal investigations, various arrangements of wounds have been adopted, having reference to the phenomena which they present, the consequences which naturally follow them, or the morbid appearances which they leave behind ; and Uupon these principles Chaussier has constructed a “ Table sy- noptique des Blessures,” embracing many important circum- stances. Of the artificial arrangements of wounds usually found in books of surgery, lawyers have sometimes taken advantage, and have contended, that wherever a person died of a wound not ^belonging to the mortal class, it must have been from misconduct, or ex malo regimine ; but legal investigations have, at the same .time, afforded the-best possible proof of the insufficiency of all such arrangements. Thus, in a case alluded to by Baron iHume, we find three physicians and two surgeons swearing, ■ that by “ the rules of their prognostics,” the wounds received by a person named Houston were mortal; whereas Houston was alive, and was prosecutor in the very case in which these gen- tlemen deponed to this effect. As military surgeons, however, our chief interest in ascertaining the mortality of wounds, is to prevent us, on the one hand, abandoning our wounded com- rades, where our efforts might be useful to them ; and, on the other, to prevent our wasting time in unavailing efforts to benefit those whose injuries are beyond the reach of human aid. All must admire the correct view which the gallant Lord Nelson took of this subject in his dying moments; sen- sible that he had received a mortal wound, he insisted on his surgeon foregoing his attention to him, and offering his assist- ance to those to whom such assistance might be useful. From the depth to which wounds extend, they are denomi-

MILITARY SURGERY. 6 medicine and surgery. “All those who have practised medicine in armies have observed, that the practice of it there presents difficulties which are very remarkable, whether on account of the nature and severity of the affections which attack soldiers, on account of the complicated forms in which those affections are met with in camps and in hospitals, or on account of nu- merous obstacles and interruptions to the usual and approved modes of treatment in civil life. Hence it is that, indepen- dently of the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary for every physician, he who is destined for the service of the army ought to have accurate and precise information with regard to the condition of the soldier, his manner of life, his habits, his duties, his exercises, the numerous causes of dis- ease which beset him, and the extraordinary circumstances in which he is placed, particularly in the time of war.” These circumstances may be supposed to have claimed, more or less, the attention of reflecting men ever since war came to be studied as a science, or practised by civilized na- tions. It has indeed been observed, by an elegant writer, that “ military surgery, rude and imperfect though it might have been, if not the very first, was at least amongst the earli- est of the arts which the follies and the infirmities of mankind forced them to cultivatebut it is obvious, that this remark applies rather to those rude and imperfect traces of the art, such as it was practised by the heroes of antiquity, and no- ticed in the writings of historians, than to. a branch of science which now affords a theme of study, and a field of occupation for a numerous class of practitioners. Military surgery, as it now exists, is so essentially the creation of the late war, its principles have been so fully developed, and its future prac- tice must be so much influenced by the experience acquired in the recent campaigns, that to this experience I must chief- ly refer in laying down the rules of treatment applicable to those formidable diseases which assail our fleets and our armies,

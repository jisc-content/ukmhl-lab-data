MILITARY SURGERY. 418 there is only one vessel of importance to tie, the haemorrhage may readily be commanded by an assistant during the mo- mentary space of time requisite for this purpose; but in the more distant parts of the extremities, when the blood flows through several nearly equal sized vessels, the hands of an as- sistant are liable to become fatigued before these can be all secured, particularly if he exhausts himself, as an inexpe- rienced assistant often does, by pressing too soon, or with an unnecessary degree of force. In noticing the application of the tourniquet during amputation, it may be necessary to caution the young surgeon against the use of too large a pad, the objections to which are well stated by Mr. Copland Hut- chison, who gives an account of an embarrassing accident which occurred to himself, and refers to a fatal one which hap- pened to Mr. Guthrie from this cause. “ A principal objec- tion to the placing of a large pad over the artery is, that the web of the tourniquet passing over a surface so much ele- vated above the circumference of the thigh, a considerable angular space on each side of it will be left slightly, or not at all compressed by the circular band of the tourniquet, how- ever closely the instrument may be screwed. This will not only endanger the loss of a large portion of blood, from the divided ends of such vessels as may happen to traverse that space, a circumstance to be particularly guarded against in cases of debility ; but the emission of blood must also em- barrass and obscure the view of the young surgeon, in the subsequent parts of the operation.-" In operating at the shoulder-joint, the only effectual means of suppressing the haemorrhage, is by pressure above the clavicle, and with due attention this pressure may always be made ef- fectual ; but I have to caution the surgeon against an acci- dent which once happened to myself in this operation. “ In speaking of the operation at the shoulder-joint, I remark- ed, that although this operation has undergone many mo-

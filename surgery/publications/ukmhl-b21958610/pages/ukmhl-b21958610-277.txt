257 WOUNDS OE THE ARTERIES. As a matter of fact, we know, that since the dissemination of Dr. Jones's views, and since the adoption of small ligatures hy the generality of surgeons, cases of secondary haemorrhage, from wounds, amputations, and operations for aneurism have become much less frequent. This fact is worth a volume of reasoning on the subject, and with this fact we must rest con- tented, although Scarpa has, with much ingenuity, endea- ' voured to convince us, that the division of the internal coats !<of an artery is more likely to produce ulcerative than adhe- j-sive inflammation in the cavity of the artery, since the solu- tion of continuity caused by a small ligature rather re- 'Sembles a lacerated and contused wound, than an incision. He argues also with much plausibility, that the ligature after .cutting through the inner coats, does not retain the margins .or cut surfaces in reciprocal contact, but sinks between them, sand only constricts the unbroken sides of the external coat. The original mode of securing arteries was with a needle and Jigature, to which the foregoing observations do not apply ; and jt'for the employment of the needle, the following are the di- rections given by Pare : <{ If the artery continue to bleed, cut up the wound if it has been sewed, and pass a needle under the artery, enclosing along with it in the ligature, much or little flesh according to the circumstances of the case.” There are, lowever, very few cases in which this mode of proceeding is aow thought eligible. It is objectionable on account of the oam which it occasions, the great length of time which the igature takes to separate, and the danger of haemorrhage by he premature slackening of the ligature, from the wasting of he parts included in it. The needle has therefore been almost ntirely superseded by the use of the tenaculum or forceps ; r?ith cither of these instruments, the extremity of the vessel is o be drawn out, and a noosed ligature, which may be previously 'laced loosely on the tenaculum, is slipped over its point, and •ed upon the vessel by an assistant.

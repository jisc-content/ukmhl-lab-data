OPHTHALMIA. 433 the medium of a diseased atmosphere. Exclusive of conta- gion, the troops serving in Egypt were exposed to many causes productive of ophthalmia. rI he excess ol heat and light, an atmosphere loaded with particles of sand raised by the wind and forced against the eyes ; the alternate expo- sure to these agents during the day, and to heavy dews during the night, form a combination of circumstances act- ing both as predisposing and exciting causes. How far the excess of heat and of light are calculated to operate inju- riously upon the eyes, every one must be sensible from his own experience; and it is unnecessary to enter into any laboured refutation of the opinion of some writers who deny their agency. It must, however, be admitted, that in order to account for the extreme prevalence of this complaint both in the English and French armies employed in Egypt, as well as amongst the natives of the place, other causes must have operated. Savary, who contends for the general salubrity of the climate of Egypt, observes, that disorders of the eyes are the most prevalent complaints amongst the Egyptians, and that the number of blind from this cause is immense. In his time the great mosque at Cairo alone contained eight thousand miserable victims of the disease. The hot winds of Egypt, loaded at particular times with particles of dust, have been con- sidered as a very powerful cause of ophthalmia ; but Assalini, who accompanied the French army to Egypt, argues against the operation of this dusty atmosphere as a principal cause of the disease, and observes, â€œ that if the dust or the sand of the soil of Egypt were the cause of ophthalmia, this malady would not cease to attach the inhabitants during the whole course of the year with the same force, since a day scarcely passes in which they are not obliged to walk in a thick mist, or in whirlwinds of dustand he goes on to remark, that it wras chiefly dur- ing the inundation of the N ile that a great number of Freneb soldiers were affected with ophthalmia, when the dust and

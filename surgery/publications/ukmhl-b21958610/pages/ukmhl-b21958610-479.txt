459 SYPHILIS. them from the Wcst.” The novelty of its symptoms, anil the wonderful rapidity with which it was propagated throughout every part of the then known world, soon rendered it an im- portant object of medical inquiry. The disease became the terror and scourge of every country ; the physicians stood ap- palled, and, confessing their ignorance of any means of cure, and their inability to check the progress of the disease, con- firmed the opinion of its recent origin. We have, however, in these early periods of its history, some very accurate ac- counts of its appearance and progressive extension. Thus, Marcellus Cumanus observes, “ th#t he had seen many offi- cers and foot soldiers, while he was in the camp at Navarre, to have several scabs or pustules breaking out on the face, and spreading all over the rest of their bodies ; the first of which appeared usually under the preputium, or on the outside like a grain of millet; sometimes behind the glans, with a slight itching ;—at other times a single pustule would arise like a little bladder, without much pain, but itching also; if rubbed or scratched, there arose an ulcer corrosive and smarting like the sting of an ant.'1 John de Vigo, speaking of this disease, says, “ Ejus origo in partibus genitalibus, viz. in vulva in mulieribus, ct in virga in hominibus semper fere fuit, cum pustulis parvis, interdum lividi ccloris, aliquando nigri, non- nunquam subalbidi, cum callonitutc can circumdante.” These descriptions appear to me deserving of particular attention ; because, on the one hand, they admit that latitude of appear- ances, which, in characterizing venereal ulcerations, I have always held it necessary to adopt; and, on the other hand, they afford a proof that the hardened and callous base of the ulceration, which was assumed by Mr. Hunter as the peculiar and distinctive character of chancre, did not escape the notice ol the very earliest writers on this diseaes. For many years after the appearance of syphilis, the infec- tion was supposed to be conveyed, like the plague, from on

114 MILITARY SURGERY. rine in the blood is in great excess ; but when inflammatory action is more moderate, we shall learn more of the nature of blood from examining its texture, than from merely viewing the surface of the coagulum. In general terms it may be stated, that a firm texture of the blood points out a strong action of the blood-vessels, so as to give a presumptive sign that the bleed- ing has been proper, and vice versa, if the coagulum be re- markably loose in texture, we should particularly question the propriety of repeating the operation. The circumstances which give rise to inflammatory attacks may act either indirectly through the medium of the consti- tution, or directly on the part affected, and where there is any fault in the constitution dependant upon disorder in any of the three principal systems of organic life, the alimentary, the vascular, or the nervous, this fault impedes the curative process in disease, and in inflammation gives rise to actions excessive in degree, or imperfect and faulty in kind. For proofs and illustrations of the extensive influence of de- rangement of the chylopoetic viscera upon local disease, I must refer at once to the writings of Mr. Abcrnethy, who has de- monstrated, in the most convincing and impressive manner, the important truth, that health and strength spring from a right performance of the chylopoietic functions, and that weak- ness and disease are consequences of their disorder and de- rangement. Similar views of the effects of derangement in the functions of the alimentary canal on those diseases falling more immediately within the province of the physician, have been taken by my late respected colleague in the Royal Infir- mary, Dr. Hamilton, in a work which I conceive has done more to simplify and improve the practice of physic, and to inculcate just notions upon this subject into the minds of the profession and of the public, than any other volume that ever was published. But while fully disposed to admit the paramount influ-

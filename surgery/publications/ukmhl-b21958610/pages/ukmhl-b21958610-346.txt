I allude here to the case of a most promising young gentleman, a stu- dent of medicine, upon whom I performed this operation some years ago ; this case is detailed by my late colleague Dr. Duncan in the 28th volume of the Edinburgh Medical Jour- nal ; and I am induced to refer to it because I have discoun- tenanced the employment of any apparatus of this kind when speaking of collections of blood or air within the thorax.

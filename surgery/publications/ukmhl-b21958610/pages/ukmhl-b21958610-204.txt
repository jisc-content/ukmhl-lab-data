MILITARY SURGBRY. 184 In the valuable work of Ollivier already noticed, the au- thor attempts to characterise three different varieties of traumatic gangrene, which appear to me to be only different degrees of the same affection, influenced perhaps by the con- stitution of the individual, by the state or situation of the sore upon which it supervenes, and by the length of time during which that sore may have existed previous to the invasion of the disease. As these subdivisions have not been recognised by some of the most experienced practical writers, I shall content myself with a general description of the character- istic marks of traumatic, or hospital gangrene. In the simplest cases, where the disease supervenes upon a punc- ture, slight incision, or scratch, it is described by Mr. Black- adder as exhibiting local phenomena very much resembling those which arc produced by vaccine inoculation; and he gives a brief account of an accident which happened to himself in dissecting the stump of a patient who died of this disease. Having punctured himself with the point of his scalpel in one of the fingers, the part became inflamed, a vesicle, having a depression in its centre, and containing a watery fluid of a livid colour, formed upon a hard elevated base, tbe surrounding integuments became tumefied, and ex- tremely sensible to the touch ; about the distance of the fourth of an inch from the base of the tumour, a very distinct areola of a bluish-red colour made its appearance, and con- tinued visible for several days ; these local appearances were accompanied with general indisposition, hcadach, nausea, and frequent chilliness, which were relieved by the use of mutral salts, pediluvium, and warm diluents. The inflammation gradually subsided, but the sore had no disposition to heal; it did not enlarge externally, but was disposed to burrow under the integuments. This phagedenic disposition was ultimate- ly got the better of by laying open the sore, and by repeated applications of caustic ; but it was two months before a coni-

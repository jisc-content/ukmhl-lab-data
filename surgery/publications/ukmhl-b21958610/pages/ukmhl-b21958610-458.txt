438 MILITARY SURGERY, tion, according to the situation in which it originates, into three general forms,—inflammation of the eyelids,—inflam- mation of the parts between the orbit and globe of the eye, —and, lastly, inflammation of the eye-ball itself, or oph- thalmitis. Of these several affections numerous subdivisions exist, but, premising that the seat of the disease to which I wish more particularly to advert, is in the conjunctiva lining the eyelids, and covering the anterior part of the eye, I adopt the division of ophthalmia employed by the dis- tinguished Italian Professor Scarpa, and various other au- thors, into acute and chronic, as one of the best suited to the object proposed in the following observations, which is, to give such a practical view of the subject, as will enable us to meet it by the most efficient treatment, without bestowing too minute an attention on some of those minor shades of dif- ference, which it is impossible, and perhaps unnecessary to advert to, in treating the disease on that extensive scale on which it has become the duty of military surgeons to meet it. In the valuable work of Dr. Vetch, which has been so often referred to, the word ophthalmia is restricted to an in- flammation of the conjunctiva, including that part of it which lines the palpebr®, as well as the portion which covers the eye ; while Dr. Vetch employs the term ophthalmitis sclerotica to denote the disease as affecting the sclerotic coat of the eyeball, and to designate the affection commonly known by the name of iritis, he employs the term oph- thalmitis sclerotica interna, or ophthalmitis iritica. These are subdivisions of great utility, as marking the different sites of the disease ; and it may be observed, that its severity and difficulty of cure are in a great measure proportioned to the progress it has made from without inwards. Thus, the inflammation, while confined exclusively to the conjunctiva, although sometimes a severe and obstinate affection, is less

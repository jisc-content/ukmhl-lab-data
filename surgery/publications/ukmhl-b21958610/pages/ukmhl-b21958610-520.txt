I consider, therefore, the use of injections, with a view solely to their irritating qualities, as a practice very far from being generally admissible. As- tringent injections, if used too strong, will produce every possi- ble degree of irritation, and may lead to all the ill consequen- ces of those more decidedly of an irritating quality ; but when the strength is duly regulated, so as to produce a very slight degree of smarting when injected into the canal, they are cal- culated to lessen the discharge gradually, without increasing the inflammation, and to prevent the occurrence of what is termed a gleet, a tedious and troublesome sequela of gonorrhoea in the form of a thin and serous-like discharge. As the ap- plication of an astringent fluid to the canal can only be tem- porary, it requires to be frequently repeated ; and perhaps the oftener this is done the better, provided care is taken, by using a round pointed syringe, and introducing it cautiously, not to irritate the urethra. The articles used in the form of injections, both from the vegetable and mineral kingdom, are innumerable. Of the for- mer, decoctions of oak or peruvian bark, infusions of tea, port wine, and other substances, have occasionally succeeded in the cure of gonorrhu-a ; of the latter, solutions of the metallic salts, particularly those of lead, zinc, mercury, copper, iron, and silver are most employed, and these nearly in the order in which I have now enumerated them, varying in strength from one to twenty grains to an ounce of distilled water. This variety in the strength of injections marks strongly the different de- grees of susceptibility in the urethras of different individuals, 4

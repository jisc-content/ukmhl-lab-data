Quietness, rest, opiates, severe and rigid abstinence, with warm fomentations to the belly, and laxative glysters, are powerful auxiliaries to blood-let- ting. When we have a sound portion of gut protruding through the belly, our business is to put it back, and close the external wound. When we have a wounded intestine protruding, the steps most obviously calculated to preserve the patient’s life, are to return the uninjured part of the bowel, and either to close the wound of the gut in the way described by Lembert, or to stitch the wounded point to the wound in the ab- dominal parietes. In discussing this subject, I have always, on the one hand, endeavoured to repress a too officious inter- ference with the processes of nature ; while, on the other, I have endeavoured, by the narration of some extraordinary re- coveries, and by a reference to others, to show how cautious wre ought to be in pronouncing any injuries absolutely mortal, and what encouragement we have to persevere to the last in our efforts at relief. In wounds of the trunk, both those of the thorax and ab- domen,—cavities filled with organs essential to life,—every re- covery must in some measure be looked upon as an escape, “ and so carefully have these escapes been recorded in the annals of surgery, that in searching the records of our profes- sion, the diligent student is apt to lose sight of the general fatality of such wounds, and he reads of cures till he forgets that there are dangers.” But the sources of danger are numerous and complicated, are both present, and remote; haemorrhage in the first instance, from vessels concealed and inaccessi- ble, inflammation supervening, and extending rapidly over the lining membranes, and internal suppurations, profuse in quantity, and little accessible to the efforts of surgery.

military 8UR0EUY. 351- Wliile severe cases of lacerated, contused, or gunshot wounds of the limbs lead to the question of amputation, sim pic incised, or punctured wounds, can seldom, perhaps never, be a cause for the immediate performance of this operation. Such wounds indeed, when confined to the muscular parts of the limb, and not complicated by the division of large blood- vessels, the fracture of bones, or the opening of joints, are for the most part devoid of danger, and may be successfully treated by the judicious employment of plasteT and bandage, along with a favourable position of the limb ; and this position is that which relaxes the wounded muscles, and obviates the gaping of the wound. A little reflection will show', that this object is in many cases more easily accomplished than at first might be imagined. An incised wound inflicted with the sabre on the arm or thigh, where the bone lies imbedded in the centre of the muscular substance, provided it does not penetrate or fracture the bone, is of course confined to less than half the thickness of the limb. If, therefore, the sabre strikes in such a position as to divide the flexor muscles, the wound is con- fined to these, the extensors remaining unhurt, and vice versa, so that wre cannot, in such cases, have those muscles which naturally antagonise each other, divided by the same blow. Perhaps, I ought to except from this general view of the sub- ject, wounds penetrating transversely across the calf of the leg,, where nearly the whole muscular substance of the limb is found on its posterior or popliteal aspect. Here, however, we are still enabled to carry into effect our views-of approximating the lips of the wound, by bending the kiiee and extending the ankle joints, so as to relax the wounded muscles. Where an extensive sabre wound lias cut across the princi- pal arterial trunk supplying a limb, we shall seldom have an opportunity of tendering our services in due rime to save the patient, and the ha-morrhago will of course be accelerated in proportion as the wound is nearer to the trunk of the body.

1G9 ULCEKS. In the treatment of those ulcers which occurred amongst the men of the Royals at Prince of Wales island, little could be effected by the use of any local applications, unless, at the same time,attempts were made to invigorate the constitution by ; generous diet, bark, and wine ; but unfortunately the digestive , powers and the functions of the alimentary canal were, in many i instances, so materially impaired, as to prevent our obtaining ; any very obvious advantage from the use of these remedies.

Where every application has so repeatedly failed in my own hands, I have some hesitation in holding forth any one

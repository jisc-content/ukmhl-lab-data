In cases of compound fracture, when the bone protrudes through the integuments, there can be no difficulty in dis- tinguishing the nature of the accident; but in simple fractures, when the soft parts remain entire, the diagnosis is sometimes attended with difficulty : this is more particularly the case when they occur close to the joints. The principal diagnostics are pain and inability to use the fractured limb, distortion more or less considerable, and above all, a crepitus or grating of the fractured portions of bone against each other. The two first symptoms, pain and inability of motion are extremely equivocal, particularly when the fracture is seated close to a joint, for here they are equally characteristic of luxation. The distortion, when the fracture is situated towards the mid- dle of the long cylindrical bones, is often so conspicuous, as at once to mark the nature of the accident; and in bones lying superficially, covered only by the common integuments, as the clavicle and the spine of the tibia, we can often detect a frac- ture by the eye, or by running our fingers along the course of the bone. Something may also be learned in doubtful cases, from the nature of the cause producing the injury. Thus, as military surgeons, it is well to bear in mind, that many of those accidents to which the soldier is exposed, arc not cal- culated to produce luxation, while they prove common causes of fracture. In the treatment of fractures, our art has been progressively improved in proportion as it has been simplified ; and we are now convinced, that the least possible degree of force with which we can reduce a fractured limb, and the most simple contrivance by which we can retain it in a proper position, is to be preferred. The first object is often to be accomplished by the hand of the surgeon, without any extraneous aid, and

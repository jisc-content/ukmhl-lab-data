138 MILITARY SURGERY. Warmth and moisture combined, arc often found a power- ful means of combating internal or deep-seated inflammation. Inflammations of the intestines, urinary bladder, and other abdominal viscera, have been specified as cases in which the good effects of warm applications are generally conspicuous. In such cases, they may either he applied to the surface in the way of fomentation, or bath, or they may be thrown into the bowels in the form of injections. In preparing water for the purpose of fomentations, it is customary to boil in it poppy- heads, chamomile flowers, linseed, or other anodyne and emolli- ent ingredients; hut how far these are useful is not distinctly as- certained, and many practitioners believe that warm water alone is as efficacious as decoctions of particular herbs. While fomen- ! tations are only to he considered as a temporary or occasional ex- pedient, a more permanent form of emollient applications is used in the shape of cataplasms, which, to insure their full effect, should be frequently renewed, as they soon lose the degree of heat upon which their efficacy so much depends. It is, however, ' to the advanced stage of inflammation, when its termination in suppuration becomes inevitable, that cataplasms are more pe- culiarly appropriate. Various saline substances, such as com- mon salt, muriate and acetate of ammonia, &c., are sometimes added to warm fomentations, as well as to cold lotions, for the purpose of being applied to inflammatory affections ; and these warm discutient applications are applicable to chronic swell- ings, more particularly to some affections of the joints of an indolent character. Of the particular inflammations likely to be most be- nefited by the use of cold or of hot applications, it is diffi- cult to speak with much precision ; to inflammatory affections of the head, and of the extremities, we apply cold lotions freely, and often with the best effects; in inflammations seated on the trunk, there is a necessity for caution in the

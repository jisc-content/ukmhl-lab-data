GONORRHOEA. 493 the urethra, the stream of urine is often greatly diminished ; the glans, and sometimes the whole penis are affected with an unusual heat, sense of fulness, and swelling. Even in its flac- cid state, the penis retains a preternatural degree of firmness and tension, particularly along the course of the corpus spon- giosum, while it often becomes affected, particularly during the night, with involuntary painful erection, and incurvation. This constitutes the symptom termed chordee, one of the most distressing to which venereal patients are subjected. The swelling not unfrequently extends to the prepuce, and when the opening is naturally small, this swelling, by augmenting the bulk of the glans, and at the same time thickening the substance of the prepuce, and diminishing the extent of its aperture, renders it impossible to denude the glans ; thus constituting the affection termed phimosis. When the prepuce is either preternaturally contracted, from an original malformation, or from the inflammation incident to it in gonorrhoea, it sometimes happens, that in this con- tracted state, it is forced behind the glans, thus giving rise to the disease termed paraphimosis, and constituting an affection extremely troublesome, and not devoid of danger. In this state, while the inflammation and swelling of the glans is in- creased in consequence of the stricture behind it, the prepuce itself sometimes becomes (edematous, thus augmenting the thickness of its coats, proportionally increasing the stricture, and rendering it impossible to draw it forward over the glans. Such are the most common symptoms of a severe attack of gonorrhoea, and these symptoms are greatly varied both in extent and duration, by the habits of the individual, and his mode of living. In careless, dissipated young men, they often continue, where their severity is not such as at once to confine the individual, to increase and diminish alternately for weeks ; but in no well regulated regiment should this ever happen. By frequent inspections the men will see that it is

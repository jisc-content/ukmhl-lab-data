WOUNDS AND EBACTURES OK THE EXTREMITIES. 350 across, Riul admitting of retraction. If the artery be com- pletely divided, a considerable quantity of blood is quickly lost, and syncope or death arrests the flow. When a limb is carried away, the syncope which frequently supervenes, con- tributes much to prevent the bleeding; and it has been re- marked, that haemorrhage does not usually return after this spontaneous cessation, unless from impropriety of conduct or accidental violence. In some few cases of arteries torn across, particularly in one which has been minutely described and .figured by Mr. Lizars, a peculiar corrugation or puckering of the internal coat has been observed, sufficient, in the faint and languid state of the circulation succeeding such an injury to obviate the effusion of blood, and naturally leading to a reaction within the extremity of the vessel, accompanied with the effusion of lymph, and the complete and permanent closure of the tube. In this way we are probably to explain many of those remarkable cases in which limbs have been separated from the trunk, either by large shot or by machinery, with- out fatal haemorrhage; and perhaps the same state of the in- ternal coat of an artery extending to a distance upwards from the wound will explain another remarkable fact, which has been observed, namely, the absenoe of all bleeding from ar- teries cut fairly across with the amputating knife in the removal of wounded limbs; of which wre have, amongst others, an interesting case recorded by Zinck, in the fourth volume of the “ Recueil des Meraoircs des Medecine ct Chirurgie Militaires.” In some comments upon this case by the editor of the work, he refers to a thesis published at Halle in 1742, by Ischep, entitled “ Casus de Ampulalionc Fanoris non eruenta.1 In this case, the mortification for which the limb was amputated, had affected the principal artery a con- siderable way above the point of amputation. On dressing flic stump on the fourth day, the extremity of the artery was

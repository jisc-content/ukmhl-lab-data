256 MILITARY SURGERY. pression of ha;morrhage, was the effusion of a plug of coagu- lating lymph from the internal coat of the artery, and that this effusion was most certainly effected by the use of small round ligatures, the employment of which is followed by a division of the internal and middle coats of the vessel. So far Dr. Jones was right; and the almost universal adoption of such ligatures, in this country at least, proves that the practice is in general amply successful; but when Dr. Jones asserted that it was only by the division of these two coats that such effusion of lymph could be produced, and a permanent suppression of the haemorrhage accomplished, he evidently went a step too far. Various experiments and observations, amongst which those of the late Professor Scar- pa hold a distinguished place, tend to prove, in the most unequivocal manner, that several modes of compression, which do not go so far as to divide the internal coats of an artery, are yet sufficient to excite a sufficient degree of inflammation to lead to a permanent obstruction of its canal. We have instances of this from the use of broad ligatures, which were formerly employed with a view of obviating the very effect which Dr. Jones desired to produce ; and we have instances also of the adhesive inflammation occurring, and uniting the opposite sides of an artery when they had been pressed together, and retained in contact by the pressure of an adja- cent tumour. These considerations “ cannot allow us to hesi- tate a moment about the rejection of Dr. Jones’s assertion, that a ligature will never be followed by a sufficient degree of adhesive inflammation within a tied artery, unless the in- ner coats of the vessel be divided by the cord. Instead of this sweeping inference, Dr. Jones should merely have concluded, that such inflammation will generally take place after the ligature has had the effect described, and not that it cannot happen under other circumstances.”

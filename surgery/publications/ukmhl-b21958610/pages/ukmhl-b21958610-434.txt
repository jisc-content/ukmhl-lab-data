MILITARY SURGERY- 414 bleed, and not be secured at the time of the operation, it may be more liable to secondary haemorrhage. And perhaps this view of the matter may account for the circumstance that two cases of secondary haemorrhage have occurred to me after flap operations, while I do not at this moment remember any case in which I have been troubled with this occurrence after am- putation by the circular incision. These seem to me the principal points of importance in a general comparison of the two operations ; and others will hereafter be mentioned, as they apply to particular parts of the limb. Although, in the removal of the fingers, when a portion of a phalanx is left protruding after a wound, one is sometimes induced to cut it across with the cutting plyers or metacarpal saw, yet, whenever the amputation of a finger falls to be performed methodically, this is now almost uniformly done at the junction of the different phalanges with each other. It is most advantageously done by two flaps, the larger formed from the internal or palmar aspect of the finger, as is well represented in Maingault’s “ Traite des diverses Ampu- tations.” When the proximal phalanx is to be removed from its junction with the metacarpal bone, it is best done by two lateral flaps, as figured in the same work. The 'partial am- putations of the metacarpus are regulated by the peculiar nature of the accident or disease; and, so far as verbal description can render them intelligible, they are well explain- ed by Mr. Guthrie. Amputation at the wrist-joint is an operation which I have neither seen nor practised, except on the dead body ; and, looking to the extent of living substance which must be ex- posed, and to the scanty and tendinous character of the cover- ing left for it, one would be inclined to say, a priori, that this was an operation which ought seldom or never to be practised. It has, however, been successfully performed, upon more than one occasion, within these few years ; and an interesting case

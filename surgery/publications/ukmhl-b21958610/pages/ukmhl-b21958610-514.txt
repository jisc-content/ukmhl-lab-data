Before proceeding to the mode of treatment, it may be ne- cessary to say a few words regarding the pathology of the disease, than which nothing can be more simple, it is now sufficiently established by irrefragable proofs, that the forma- tion of purulent matter, which was formerly thought to be a sequence of ulceration alone, takes place with equal facility, and often in very large quantity, from the inflamed surfaces of mucous membranes ; of this we have proofs in ophthalmia, in inflammation of the bronchia?, and very remarkably in the disease now under consideration. Here the discharge is some- times incredibly profuse, considering the limited extent of the ; inflamed surface, for this, in a large proportion of cases, does not reach above one or two inches within the urethra. Mr. Hunter has limited it to one and a half or two inches, which he terms the specific distance, and the purulent discharge, as he has shewn, is furnished solely from the lining membrane, and from the lacuna?. Previously to the time of this distin- guished writer, the inflammation was thought to extend along the whole course of the urethra, and the prostate, and vesicula? semitiales were thought to be generally affected ; an opinion to which the extent of the discharge might appear to give countenance, but which is now ascertained to be erroneous. Many patients will themselves observe, that they have no pain or ardor urina? beyond a given spot, extending about two inches from the extremity of the penis ; upon desiring them to press along the course of the urethra from this spot for- wards, matter will be pressed out, and when this part of the canal is once completely evacuated by drawing the finger two or three times along its course, no more matter can be pressed |

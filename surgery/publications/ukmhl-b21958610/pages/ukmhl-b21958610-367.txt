34-7 WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. the whole mass of seamen composing the British navy, from the beginning to the end of the last war, embracing a period of sixteen years, only eight cases of urinary calculus occurred, being in the proportion of only one such case to ten thousand seven hundred and fifty patients admitted into the naval hos- pitals. Having now pointed out the objects most deserving of at- tention in wounds of the abdominal viscera, it may be neces- sary to avail myself of this opportunity to advert to the sub- ject of Hernia, with the double purpose of explaining, on the one hand, why I do not hold it necessary in a course of Mili- tary Surgery to go minutely into the symptoms, pathology and treatment of hernia, and, on the other, to urge the advantages of an early operation whenever it shall be necessary to resort to this means of relief. In the sixth volume of the “ Recueil des Memoires de Medicine, et de Chirurgie Militaires,” &e., we have some reflections by Savreux, Surgeon-Major of the legion de TOrnc, on the impossibility of a soldier serving actively when afflicted with hernia. He there points out the various risks to which he is exposed, and concludes, « que tous ceux qu’atteint cet infirmite sont physiquement impropres a tout service militaire act if.” The propriety of excluding from the army every individual afflicted with this malady, or whose bodily conformation gives reason to anticipate it, has already been pointed out; and whenever hernia supervenes upon an individual engaged in the service, although, by the existing regulations, he is not directed to be discharged, vet he can scarcely ever be looked upon as an efficient sol- dier, but should be selected for some light duty, or transferred to a garrison establishment. Hence it happens that hernia, in the only state in which it acquires peculiar interest as a sur- gical disease, namely, in a state of strangulation, seldom pre- sents itself to the military surgeon. I know many medical officers of the army, of long standing, who have never met

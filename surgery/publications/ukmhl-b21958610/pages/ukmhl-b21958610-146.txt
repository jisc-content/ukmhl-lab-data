126 MILITARY SURGERY. the level of the surrounding parts, if a healthy disposition exists, the healing process is completed by the gradual exu- dation of a tenacious substance, which is subsequently con- verted into a tegument for the injured part, and this consti- tutes what is termed Cicatrization. When none of the preceding results occurs as a consequence of inflammation, but when the symptoms, particularly the constitutional ones, become aggravated, Mortification is likely to be the result of the local disease, the approach of which is marked by the fiery redness which exists in the commence- ment of inflammation passing into a dark and livid hue, the sensibility of the part becoming blunted, and the cuticle often rising into blisters ; the incipient stage of this process has been termed Gangrene, in contradistinction to what has more strictly been tenned Mortification or Sphacelus ; the former appellation, gangrene, is applicable so long as any degree of circulation continues through any of the vessels of the part affected, so long as any degree of warmth remains, and so long as the nerves of the part retain any portion of their sensibility; it is in short the intermediate stage between inflammation, which is its precursor, and sphacelus, which is, . I may say, always its termination. Gangrene admits also of another subdivision, into the infiammatory, humid, or acute ; and into the dry or chronic. Some recent writers, and particularly Baron Larrey, have also insisted much upon an important division of gangrenes into those from an internal j and those from an external cause; of the former a very re- markable species has been observed, and attributed to the feeding on spoiled or diseased grain, particularly to bad rye. The chief external causes of gangrene, are burns, caustics, the presence of ichorous, urinary, or fecal matter in the cel- lular membrane ; and those particularly affecting the soldier are extreme cold, and gunshot wounds. Of the former many interesting examples are recorded by Baron Larrey in his

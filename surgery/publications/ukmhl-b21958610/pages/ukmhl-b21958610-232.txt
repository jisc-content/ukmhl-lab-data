It is the pe- culiar liability to excite inflammation in the continuous textures, the formation and confinement of matter under fasciae, the chance of haemorrhage from injuries of deep- seated vessels, and the risk of tetanus, which constitute the distinctive character of punctured wounds. As much mis- chief is to be apprehended from the inflammation of the fascia, we accordingly perceive, that wherever this is strong, fibrous, and tense, the constitutional and local symptoms accompany- ing punctured wounds are proportionally aggravated, partly from the inflammation of the aponeurosis itself, and partly from the unyielding texture of this substance preventing the swelling of the muscles beneath it. These consequences are occasionally seen in injuries from bleeding at the bend of the arm, and in punctures of the palmar or plantar aponeu- roses, where the violence of the pain and other symptoms are often greatly disproportioned to the trifling appearance of the external wound. The constitutional symptoms in such cases often run so high as to endanger the life of a patient; and hence our prognosis ought always to be guarded. In punc- tured wounds passing close to important arterial, trunks, we sometimes see these vessels escape in a miraculous man- ner ; and, on other occasions, we find that an important arte- rial trunk has been wounded, although from its being impos- sible to see the bottom of tbc wound, and from the flow of blood externally being easily suppressed, such an accident may not at first have been suspected. In the treatment "of punctured wounds, it was long a fa- vourite, and certainly a plausible doctrine, that as many of the untoward occurrences in their treatment were occasioned by a deviation from the nature of incised wounds, the most obvious and most effectual means of removing the obsta- 8

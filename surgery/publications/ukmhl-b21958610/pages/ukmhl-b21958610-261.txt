fiUNSHOT WOUNDS. 241 • * medical conjurors; “for although the regular practitioners could not deny that wounds were healed under the employment of water solely, yet many of them affected to attribute this con- ssequence to magical and unchristian arts, and it is doubtful whether in those days patients having any pretensions*to ’piety would have submitted to the employment of the simple'ele- iment, labouring as it did, under the anathema of the church.” Compresses dipt in cold water have lately been recom- nmended by Kern and Assalini, as well as by our countryman 'Air. Guthrie, who has taken some pains to show, that the •sloughing consequent upon musket wounds does not necessa- rily take place to the extent formerly supposed, and that the extent of this sloughing and suppuration may still far- ther be diminished, and the cure promoted by the judicious '.application of compresses soaked in cold water : by this means inflammation is in some instances prevented, in others mo- derated, and in almost all, much circumscribed. When this plan is adopted, oil skins should be employed to prevent the beds getting saturated with the liquid, by which severe pul- monary and rheumatic attacks are sometimes induced ; and with these precautions, the surgeon can be at no loss for a remedy, which is seldom injurious, and rarely, if ever inter- feres with the efforts of nature. There are, however, particu- lar habits with which cold applications do not agree; and I be- lieve it may be asserted, as a general principle, “that cold docs ,'n0 g00tl any stage of inflammation when it does not prove agreeable to the feelings of the patient,” when, in short, it does not give relief. In such cases warm fomentations, or cata- plasms, are advantageously substituted; and leeches applied in the neighbourhood of the wound, or the abstraction of blood from the system at large, are in some cases requisite. d he foregoing observations are chiefly applicable to musket wounds ; those from cannon shot are, for the most part, suffi- cient causes for the amputation of a limb, and will fall to R

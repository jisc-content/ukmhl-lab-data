177 HOSPITAL GANGRENE. distinct notice of this disease is to be met with in the writings of Pare, under its appropriate name, there can be little doubt that many of his observations refer to hospital gangrene. Our countryman Wiseman, the most distinguished military sur- geon of his day, has some observations on putrid ulcers, which, without any great stretch of imagination, may be re- ferred to the hospital sore. The only circumstance casting a doubt upon the nature of the disease described by Wiseman and the preceding writers, is the absence of all mention of the contagious nature of the complaint; but this single circumstance does not necessarily imply a difference in the two diseases; for, as we find that the phagedena gangrenosa has been ex- pressly described by authors without any notice of its contagious nature, it is quite possible, on the other hand, that contagion may have had a place in some of the cases above noticed, with- out its being mentioned by the older writers, whose views on the subject of contagion and infection were less precise than those we now adopt. Hospital gangrene is probably the disease alluded to by Horstius in the beginning of the seventeenth century, when he observes, Hhat much contention and wonder had arisen why wounds were so difficult of cure, “ Cur hoc Martiali scculo, vulnera fere ovinia in pejus ruant, difficultcnjue cu- renlur; and he assigns, as the cause of this, a vitiated at- mosphere from the sordes of camps, and a cachectic habit of body, “ either bilious, or corrupted by the venereal disease.” La Motte seems to be the first author who considers the ' dlsease we are now treating of as a species of gangrene, and he speaks of it as an every-day occurrence in the Hotel I)leu at Paris, “ where,” says he, “ it supervenes upon or accom- ! panies almost all the wounds treated in that hospital, and a great part of the abscesses opened there, on account of the corrupted air which prevails, and which the wounded respire.” Since the time of La Motte the disease has been noticed by N

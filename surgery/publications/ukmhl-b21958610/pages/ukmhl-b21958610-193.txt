ULCERS. 175 skin, become thick, prominent, smooth, and rounded ; the granulations soft, smooth, pale-coloured, and glossy on the ' surface ; the pus imperfectly formed, and often mixed with flakes of coagulating lymph, which adheres tenaciously to the surface of the granulations, and is with difficulty removed. In indolent ulcers there is a backwardness to form granulations; and in those granulations that are formed, a want of sufficient strength to form a complete cure; such granulations are unable to support themselves beyond a very short period ; and although the ulcer proceeds slowly towards amendment, so long as the granulations stand their ground, these are often suddenly absorbed, and the ulcer spreads nearly to its original size ; twenty-four hours may un- do all that had been formed in so many days, or even weeks. This is a change which takes place so frequently, and under such different circumstances, that it cannot be attributed to any external cause, but must be supposed to arise from the granulations which are formed in that indolent state of parts being unfit for the purpose for which they were intended; and in such cases the object of our treatment should be, not simply to heal an ulcer, but to render the cure as permanent as possible. With a view to produce granulations of a healthy character, various stimulating lotions and unguents have been employ- ed. Of the lotions, those containing small proportions of the nitrous and muriatic acids, solutions of the nitrate of silver, of the sulphates of copper, of iron, and of zinc, have proved the most generally useful; and latterly the black wash, solutions of the chlorurets of soda and of lime, have been much employed. Of ointments I know none more efficacious than those containing the red oxide, or the nitrate of quicksilver, and the subacetatc of copper. With a variety of these appli- cations it is necessary for every practitioner to make himself

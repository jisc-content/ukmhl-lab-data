MILITARY SURGERY. CO reduced, as, for instance, after the campaign of Austerlitz, the French army cantoned in Bavaria, had only a hundred sick in a division of eight thousand men. During a campaign, however, we ought not to calculate upon less than ten sick for every 100 fighting men, a number which is often fearful- ly increased if the army is very numerous and much concen- trated, if it is encamped on wet ground, if it has experienced great privations, and finally, if it is discouraged by defeat or want of confidence in its chiefs. An army of 100,000 men may expect, according to Vaidy’s calculation, to have 10,000 sick during a campaign, independent of any rencontre with the enemy; of which number5000 or 6000 may be medical and the rest surgical cases; but after a battle, the proportion will be reversed, and under the most favourable circumstances, he calculates upon 10,000 or 12,000 wounded, in addition to the above. To this we have sometimes to add the number of wounded left in our hands by a vanquished enemy, to whom our cares are equally due. These calculations become of great importance to medical officers, particularly as they rise up- wards in the gradation of ranks, and come eventually to be consulted as to the extent of the necessary establishments for the sick, or to regulate the proportion of medical staff and hospital stores to be allotted for any given service. The foregoing details will enable us to understand what we may expect to meet with in accompanying an army to the field; but we are also encouraged to think that sickness is not always the necessary consequence of a military life,.and that professional skill and judgment may do much to obviate its ravages when it does occur. This may be learned from various interesting accounts both of ancient and of modern wars. In the circum- stantial details of the operations of Julius Caesar’s well disci- plined army, we hear of none of his enterprises having been frustrated by the prevalence of disease amongst his troops: and although in many instances exposed to fruitful sources of dis-

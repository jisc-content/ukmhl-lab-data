MILITARY SURGERY. 480 swelling and redness of the integuments, proceeding appa- rently from without inwards; they are more rapid in their growth, more acutely sensible to the touch, and yield more readily to the common antiphlogistic remedies. With regard to the origin and most effectual means of treating venereal nodes, I feel more at a loss to speak with confidence than upon any of the symptoms heretofore mention- ed ; for while, on the one hand, it must be admitted, that affec- tions of the bones were noticed as sequelae of syphilis before the employment of mercury for its cure; yet, on the other hand, there is no room to doubt that such affections have become in- finitely more rare since the general abandonment of mercury in the profuse quantities in which it was formerly given. The comparative infrequency of nodes under the non-mercurial practice is, in my opinion, one of the best established and most important facts which the recent investigation has brought to light; and with this fact before our eyes, we can- not venture to urge the use of mercury with the same confi- dence to which I consider it to be entitled in the earlier symptoms of the disease. But it is quite possible that a mo- derate share of mercury may obviate the occurrence of a symp- tom which it may be unable to cure, nay, which, if given in profusion, it may have a tendency to aggravate. I have no difficulty in conceiving that the alterative and deobstruent ef- fects of mercury, if I may be permitted the expression, will remove a cutaneous eruption, while the profuse and con- tinued exhibition of this mineral in cases of periostitis will aggravate this symptom, and lead to caries of the bones. Affections of the bones have been noticed by some of the older writers as occurring only in those cases of the venereal disease which were cured by mercury. On this point the testimonies of Fallopius and Palmarius referred to by Dr. Hennen, are peculiarly deserving of attention. The * %

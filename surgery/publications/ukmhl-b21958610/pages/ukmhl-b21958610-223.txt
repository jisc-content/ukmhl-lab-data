203 INCISED WOUNDS. i that in deep transverse wounds on the fore part of the upper, ; and back part of the lower extremity, we can most readily ap- proximate the divided surfaces by bending the limb ; and vice versa in transverse wounds on the back part of the upper, and fore part of the lower extremity, the parts are most readily approximated by extending the limb. Having gained every thing possible by a due attention to the position of the limb, our next consideration is, the most ' eligible means of retaining the edges of the wound in imme- i diate proximity. This, in a large majority of cases, will be ! best accomplished by straps of adhesive plaster, from three- i quarters of an inch to an inch in breadth, and of such a length as to enable them to retain a sufficient hold of the surround- ing surface ; the length being proportioned to the depth i of the wound, and to the tendency which its edges may have to retraction. It is to be observed, that, in vascular parts, when much oozing is to be expected from the divided vessels, this oozing is apt to accumulate between the lips of the wound, and the straps are liable to be detached by it. This has led to a practice, lately followed here with advantage, of simply bringing the edges of the wound together, in the first instance by i one or more stitches, and delaying the accurate and complete i closure of the wound by straps for some hours, until the oozing has ceased, and the risk of secondary haemorrhage is in some measure over. In longitudinal cuts on the extremities, it is not advisable to surround the entire circumference of the limb with adhesive straps, as is often done with advantage in the case of ulcers; in the former case, the sudden infliction of the injury, and the vigour of the constitution sustaining it, often lead to a degree of inflammation, and swelling, which would be greatly aggravated by the complete enclosure of the limb in adhesive straps ; while in ulcers of long standing, on the contrary, when a deficiency of action exists, the support afford- ed and the excitement produced by the adhesive strap are

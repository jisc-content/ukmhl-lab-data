INFLAMMATION. A knowledge of the phenomena of inflammation, its causes, seats, terminations, and treatment, is so indispensable to the scientific and successful practice of surgery, in all its depart- i ments, that it seems necessary to offer a few remarks upon it ; as an introduction to this department of the course.

110 MILITARY SUROERY. Wounds, in all their forms and bearings—in all the various ; situations in which they occur, and accompanied as they often are by adventitious circumstances rendering them more complex i in their nature, and more difficult in their treatment, are a class j of accidents of all others peculiarly interesting to those prac- j titioners who may embark in the public service,—the consider- ation of these injuries constitutes the most essential part of mi- j litary surgery ; and to their treatment a large proportion of my observations are naturally devoted. Allied to the subject ] of wounds, and indeed often constituting the most formidable part of them, are Fractures of the bones, and Injuries of the . joints, subjects which follow next in order, and which must indeed be in some measure incorporated with the doctrine of wounds. The severe operations which these injuries often re- quire the military surgeon to undertake, leads us naturally to the subject of Amputation, in the consideration of which many important questions are involved—questions which must be discussed with a view to the peculiar circumstances of military life, and must sometimes be solved differently from what they would be with reference to private practice. Ophthalmia, and the various diseases of the eye, have un- fortunately for the army acquired a degree of interest to the military surgeon surpassed by no other disease ; and to many of the present generation of army surgeons this interest was enhanced by attempts to question their capacity for this branch of practice, to exclude them from a fair competition with their brethren in civil life, and to intrude into this depart- ment of military surgery, an individual who (whatever were . his merits as a dexterous operator) was certainly not superior to his military competitors, either in judgment or in general success. Of the maladies incident to those who indulge in promis- ! cuous and illicit amours, soldiers have always had their share, and the Venereal disease, in all its Protean shapes, has ever

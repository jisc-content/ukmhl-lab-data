411 AMPUTATION. well-regulated military hospital, goes often from a worse atmos- phere into a better, while a mason or house-carpenter accustomed to work all day in the open air, is taken into a large civil hospital constantly occupied with its full complement of pa- tients, and having its atmosphere thereby necessarily vitiated. This circumstance operates I know particularly upon pa- tients from the country, almost every one of whom, upon admission into our hospitals, goes through a febrile attack, frequently indeed of a transient or ephemeral character, but sometimes of a serious nature. In cases coming in from the country with chronic diseases requiring operation, it becomes a matter of serious consideration for the surgeon whether he should operate immediately, and let the symptom- atic fever of the operation and the house-fever go together, or let the patient go through his seasoning before he proceeds to operate. I have given a good deal of attention to this point, and am of opinion, that the former is, generally speaking, the best practice. After these observations on the proper period for amputa- tion, it is now time to advert to the mode of its performance, premising, that, as a general rule, in proportion as wounds are inflicted on the distant parts of the extremities, and re- mote from the trunk of the body, so will the necessity for im- mediate amputation be diminished. Here the symptomatic fever will, ceteris paribus, be less violent, and the patient will run less risk from delay. The mode of amputation becomes also a more important consideration in proportion as we ad- vance upwards from the extreme points of the fingers and toes to the shoulder and hip-joints. In the present day, the only modes of amputation in general use in the upper parts of the limbs are the double circular incision and the double flap opera- tions. The former may be considered as having long been the favourite mode of operating in Great Britain ; and to its im- provement some of the English surgeons, particularly Chescl-

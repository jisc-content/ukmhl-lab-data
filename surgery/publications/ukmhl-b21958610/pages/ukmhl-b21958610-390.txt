MILITARY SURGERY. 370 ment of those which have been merely separated from each other; and in cases of this kind, we have an additional argument in fa- vour of relaxing the wounded muscle, which is not always duly adverted to. In compound fractures, the first object of attention after the reduction of the fracture, is the closure of the external wound, a practice recommended by all the systematic writers, and which is attempted by various modes of dressing; some- times by a pledget of lint soaked in blood, and allowed to form an incrustation over it; sometimes by covering it with a paste of gum or albuminous matter, and sometimes by bringing the lips of the wound into accurate apposition with adhesive straps or sutures. But whichever of these modes may be adopted, I regret to say that the object in view is very fre- quently frustrated by excessive inflammatory action, running on to suppuration or gangrene. The practice of envelop- ing fractured limbs in splints and bandages, without undoing them for weeks together, is akin to that followed by the natives of India, of enclosing fractured limbs in moulds of soft clay. Of the successful result of this practice, I remember a remark- able instance in the case of a little boy who was brought into my tent one morning, having been run over by a waggon on the line of march, and having sustained a severe compound fracture of the leg. I was preparing to amputate this boyâ€™s limb, when his parents came in and carried him away to the potter in an adjoining village, who enveloped the leg in clay, and I believe, finally cured the patient. From the result of this case and of others similarly treated, I was naturally prepossessed in favour of the practice so strongly advocated by Baron Larrey, of dressing fractures with com- presses and cushions of straw, leaving them undisturbed till the completion of the cure, and I remember to have met with an hospital surgeon so much enamoured of this practice, that he said he never expected to lose another case of compound

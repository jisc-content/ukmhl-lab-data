MILITARY SURGERY. 174 acquainted; for 1 cannot too often repeat, that under a con- tinued use, the best of them will fail ; while it is only by oc- casional changes, either in the nature or strength of the appli- cation, that a progressive amendment can be kept up. In the treatment of indolent ulcers with surrounding oedema, blis- ters have of late been very frequently and successfully em- ployed by Mr. Syme, at the Surgical Hospital in this city. When an ulcer, whatever may have been its original character, is once reduced to the state of what is termed a simple purulent nicer, the employment of adhesive straps, as recommended by Mr. Baynton, will be found great- ly to accelerate the cure, and to render the recovery more perfect, by approximating the edges of the ulcer, and di- minishing the extent of the surface to be citatrized. When the discharge is inconsiderable, the adhesive strap is ge- nerally applied to the surface of the sore without any inter- vening substance; but even in cases where a considerable se- cretion of purulent matter takes place from the surface of an ulcer, the adhesive strap may occasionally be employed with advantage, by covering the sore, in the first place, with a little lint, and then surrounding the limb with a strap. The adhe- sive strap is a remedy of great importance in the treatment of ulcers of the legs, and few remedies have more completely an- swered the purpose intended. I can vouch for its efficacy in the treatment of ulcers of the legs under circumstances highly unfavourable, and in climates the most unhealth- ful. But a testimony perhaps less partial and more creditable to the practice is that of M. Roux, one of the surgeons of La Charite, who, in his Parallel of French and English Surgery, does ample justice to this practice, although it appears that he came to this country with any thing but prepossessions in its favour. The means of counteracting the attempts sometimes made

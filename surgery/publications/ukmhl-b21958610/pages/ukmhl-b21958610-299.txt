WOUNDS OF THE NERVES. 27‘J the different forms of this disease ; and that there may be no risk of misrepresenting the Baron’s views, the following pas- sage is introduced from the first volume of his C linique Chi- rurgicale. “ Dans les blcssures qui causent le tetanos trau- matique, si ce sont les nerfs de la region anterieure du corps qui out etc leses, j’ai remarque qu’il en resulte l’emprostho- tonos ; que l’opisthotonos au coutraire a lieu lorsque ce sont les nerfs de la region postcrieure qui ont re^u la lesion, et qu’enfin si la cause vulnerante a traverse un mcmbre de ma- mcre a attaquer egalement les deux plans de nerfs, le teta- nos complet s’etablit, en jctant l’individu dans une rectitude totalc.” The attack of tetanus is for the most part sudden, and with- out any premonitory symptom ; it is sometimes, however, pie- ceded by lassitude and uneasiness, want of sleep, faintness, and dimness of sight,- frequently also by constipation oi the bowels. There is a peculiar dejection and anxiety of counte- nance from the commencement of the attack ; the patient complains of a sense of tightness about his jaws, the muscles moving the lower jaw become rigid and constantly contract- ed ; deglutition becomes difficult, and the spasms increasing and affecting the muscles of the tongue, it is sometimes forci- bly protruded between the teeth and not unfrequently bitten through. The spasmodic affection gradually reaches to the neck and back, and the whole body becomes affected with ri- gid spasm. A shooting pain is experienced from the ensiform cartilage towards the spine, and this is held to be a pathogno- mic symptom of the disease, almost cveiy writer on this sub- ject having mentioned it, from the time of Hippocrates down- wards. When patients labouring under tetanus have arrived at their worst stage, they very often have a great aversion to liquids, and if forced to swallow them, convulsions are almost immediately excited ; hence the analogy which has been fre- quently remarked between this disease and hydrophobia.

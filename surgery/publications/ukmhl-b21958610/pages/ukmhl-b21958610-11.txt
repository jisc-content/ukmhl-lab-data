TO THE PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH. Gentlemen, The anxiety which you have always shown to increase the professional acquirements of young men who are desirous of jiossessing the Diploma of the Royal College, led you, upon the last revision of the Regulations, to introduce into your curriculum the course of Military Surgery, giving to those gentlemen who may choose to avail themselves of it, the option of attending this class in lieu of part of the Surgical attendance enjoined upon them. It will, I make no doubt, be gratifying to you to learn, that this resolution of your body has been followed by a similar one on the part of the heads of the medical depart ments of the Army and Navy, giving the same option to candidates j'or Medical Commissions in these branches of the public service. Should this publication be the means of proving to you that the patronage which you were the first to give to the Class of Military Surgery has not been misplaced, I shall be amply compensated for the labour bestowed upon it; and if any thing could possibly enhance the satisfaction which I feel in dedicating these Outlines to you, it would be the circumstance that the Chair of the College is at present filled by my Colleague, Dr. Camp- bell, one oj the earliest and most esteemed of my professional friends. I have the honour to be. Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant, GEO. BALLING ALL. llenol Row, Feb. 5, 1833.

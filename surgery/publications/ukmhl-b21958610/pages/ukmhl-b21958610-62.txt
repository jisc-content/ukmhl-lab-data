And in addition to those local precau- tions against this evil which are applicable to particular stations, forts, or barracks, I would recommend, as general measures calculated to check this destructive habit, the regu- lar establishment of two, or, in situations where the abundance and cheapness of provisions renders it practicable, of three meals a-day ; the frequent payment of the soldiers’ balances, daily instead of weekly or monthly, as used to be the case, by which these balances will be prevented from ever accumulating to a sum capable of supporting any continued course of dissi- pation ; the augmentation of the hospital stoppages on the Indian station to the same amount as in other quarters of the world ; the furnishing the men upon all stations with the most approved description of clothing and appointments, cal- culated to add to their comfort and efficiency, while it tends to diminish the sum of money left at their own disposal; these, and the supply of genuine liquor, where it cannot be altogether withheld, constitute the principal means which

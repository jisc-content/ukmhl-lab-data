442 MILITARY SURGERY. the inflammation proceeds to affect the sclerotic coat, when the pulse becomes quickened, and the pain increased, from the dense unyielding nature of this tunic. In describ- ing the inflammation of the sclerotic, I)r. Vetch has sub- divided it into what he has termed sclerotico-corncal, and sclerotico-choroideal inflammation, the first being marked by a tendency to ulceration of the cornea, originating from con- tagion, or from occasional external causes, and constituting that form of the disease from which so many soldiers have lost their eye-sight. The sclerotico-choroideal inflammation, on the other hand, which manifests itself most obviously in the form of iritis, is in many instances the effect of an arthritic or rheumatic diathesis, sometimes occurs as a symptom of syphilis, or appears in peculiar habits as the result of a mercurialized state of the system. The first variety of the affection may be considered as the advanced stage of the purulent ophthalmia of the troops; and Dr. Vetch, who has accurately marked the progress of the different phenomena, thinks that the dis- tinction between conjunctival and sclerotic inflammation may be pointed out by a very marked difference in the appearance of the blood-vessels ramified on the surface of the eye. In the in- flammation of the conjunctiva, the blood-vessels admitting of more speedy and uniform distinction, often swell out suddenly, so as to give to the eye the appearance of a uniform fleshy mass, not inaptly compared to the valvulae conniventes of the intestinal canal; while “ the circumstances,” says he, “ to be regarded in the appearance of the inflamed vessels of the sclerotic coat, are chiefly these : posteriorly we observe only a few interspersed trunks, which do not affect the intermediate space; but these, diverging as they come forwards, produce a zone, more or less complete, of minute hair-like vessels, dis- tinguished by their rectilinear direction, and their uniform concentration towards the margin of the cornea—their colour

WOUNDS OP THE HEAD. 305 tfttion, but in illustration, and in justification of the term by which I have characterised the practice,—an unmeaning per- foration of the skull. Many other cases might be adduced to shew the little inconvenience which patients occasionally sustain from perforating the cranium ; amongst them is one mentioned by Schmucker, where the trepan wras applied eleven times in less than a month, and so little was the patient inconvenienced by this operation, that he hardly ever w'Cnt to bed after it, and upon one occasion actually went to mar- ket within an hour after its performance. While I cannot look upon the operation of trepan as ad- ding, in almost any degree, to the danger of those hazardous cases in which it ought to be employed, while it is an opera- tion neither painful to the patient, nor difficult to the surgeon, we must not be hurried by this into an undue partiality for its performance, hut must always bear in mind the sentiments of the Danish surgeon, Callisen, as expressed in his Systema Ohirurgiae Hodiernae, “ Gravis tamen satis est operatic, cl nunquam, nisi indications sufficients ad sin t, institui debet It should never be forgotten, that apertures made in the cranium, whether by the trepan or otherwise, occasionally give room for the protrusion of those troublesome fungi, termed herniae cerebri, which, although somewhat lightly spoken of by a most distinguished surgeon of the present day, niy ow n experience leads me to look upon as occurrences of a most formidable and hazardous description. It should also be remembered, that there is, generally speaking, but one affection, namely, compression of the brain, which can be removed by the trepan, and perhaps I cannot better conclude my observations on this subject, than by the following remarks from a clinical lecture delivered in the Royal Infirmary some years ago. “As young men, who have necessarily much to read and much to learn, it may be well to caution you here against the extremes into which surgeons have run in esti-

109 SURGICAL DISEASES OF SOLDIERS AND SEAMEN. !The subjects which naturally present themselves to our a attention in the surgical department of this course, are t those accidents and diseases to which soldiers and seamen are particularly exposed, and to which they are more or less liable in all parts of the world. In entering upon the consideration of these, it becomes necessary to offer a few words in explanation of the arrangement which I have been induced to adopt. In this arrangement, as in all systematic works in surgery, the subject of Inflammation occurs first. To this succeeds the consideration of Burns, Ulcers, and Hospital Gangrene, all of which are intimately connected with inflam- mation, either as a cause or consequence. Burns are incident both to soldiers and seamen in a severe and dangerous form, from explosions of gunpowder. Ulcers are much less com- mon in the service than they formerly were, but they are still met with in very aggravated forms upon some foreign stations. 'â–  Hospital, or as it has of late been frequently termed, Trauma- tic Gangrene, is a disease occasionally supervening upon wounds and open sores, particularly in hospitals, and the treatment of which consequently becomes an object of much importance to every military and naval surgeon.

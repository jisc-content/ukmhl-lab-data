INTRODUCTION. 7 and to those severe and complicated injuries which it falls to the lot of the soldier and the seaman to endure. In proceeding to give a brief sketch of the history of mili- tary surgery, I conceive it quite unnecessary to dwell at any length upon the imperfect traces which we find of this art previous to the invention of gunpowder. I his produced such essential changes in the features of war, and continues to ex- ercise such a paramount influence in all our military opera- tions, that to enter into details previous to its invention and employment in battle, were, in my opinion, not only super- fluous, but altogether idle. Of the consternation which the first use of gunpowder occa- sioned amongst the troops, we may form some idea from the following relation, extracted from Monro’s account of his ex- pedition, with the worthy Scots regiment, called M‘Kay’s re- giment, levied in August 1626. Speaking of the invention of artillery, he observes, “ it is thought the invention of can- non was first found at Nurenberg, for the ruin of man ; being at first, for a long time, used for battering down of walls and cities, and for counter-batteries, till at last they were used in the field to break the squadrons and battailes of horse and foot; some carrying pieces called spingards, of four foote and a halfe long, that shot many bullets at once no greater than walnuts; and how soon the trumpet did sounde, the enemy were thundered on, first with these as with shoures of hail- stone, so that the enemies were cruelly affrighted with them, men of valour being suddenly taken away, who before were wont to fight valiantly and long with the sword and launce, more for the honour of victory than for any desire of shedding of bloud ; but now men are martyrised and cut downe at more than half a mile of distance, by those furious and thundering engines of great cannon, that sometimes shootc fiery bullets able to burne whole cities, castles, houses, or bridges, where they chance to fall ; and if they happen to light within walles.

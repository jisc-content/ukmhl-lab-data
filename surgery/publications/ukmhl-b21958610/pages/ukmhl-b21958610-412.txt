MILITARY SURGERY. 392 instance, the reduction was effected by M. Sanson, so late as the 93th day. From another paper in the third volume of the same work by Monsieur Flaubert, we learn the bad conse- quences of violent or injudicious attempts to effect the re- duction in cases of long standing, such as rupture of the axillary artery, rupture of the axillary nerves, and even death itself. Luxation of the shoulder has been produced by the punishment of picketing formerly used in cavalry regiments; but as the nature of the accident itself offers nothing peculiar in military life, it is unnecessary to enter upon it here. A complete luxation of the elbow-joint backwards, the only direction in which it occurs, is not an accident difficult to de- tect, nor if speedily attended to, difficult to reduce ; but the many instances I have seen of partial dislocations and other injuries of this joint which have either been overlooked or mis- understood, induce me to notice the following case which came under my care in the Royal Infirmary some time ago, and in which a partial luxation of this joint had been mistaken for a fracture, the patient’s arm being found, upon her admission, secured in splints. “ On either side of the upper arm there is a pasteboard splint,tightly confined bya roller, the lowerpart of the limb very tense,'and somewhat discoloured, the forearm has not, according to the usual method of treatment, been placed at a right angle with the upper arm, but forms an obtuse angle with it, and cannot be either bent or extended farther.” Upon the removal of the splints, the head of the radius was found lying behind the outer condyle of the humerus ; the entire upper surface of the olecranon was felt through the soft parts, and there was a distinct depression above this process of the ulna ; the humerus was indistinctly felt lying on the anterior surfaces of the bones of the forearm ; crepitus was quite evi- dent, but appeared to arise entirely from the friction of the displaced bones upon each other, and no crepitus could be de- tected when the two extremities of the humerus alone were

WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 365 dor to a due elevation, and binding the arm down to tli© side. Fracture of the neck of the scapula is an accident of rare occurrence, and difficult diagnosis. I have seen three cases in which this accident was believed to exist, marked by a drop- ping or falling down of the arm, with inability to move it; some degree of flatness under the acromion, and distinct cre- pitus, on alternately elevating and depressing the humerus perpendicularly. The treatment was successfully conducted in all, by elevating the elbow, and binding the arm down to the side. Fractures of the upper part of the humerus, and more es- pecially those in what is properly termed the cervix humeri, are often attended with much difficulty in the diagnosis; a difficulty, however, which is naturally greatest when the dis- placement of the broken fragments is least. In such cases, if we could be contented to let the arm remain bound down to the side for a due length of time, a cure would naturally take place without much surgical aid; but the fear of over- looking a dislocation, with which such accidents are liable to be confounded, often leads to protracted or repeated ma- nipulations, which are anything but conducive to the cure. When displacement occurs, it is naturally influenced by the powerful muscles implanted into this part of the bone ; and without going minutely into all the varieties of such ac- cidents, upon which an interesting paper is to be found by M. Marx, in the “ Repertoire d1 Anatomic, Sic.'1 I shall con- tent myself at present with quoting the following observations from one of my printed Clinical Lectures, suggested by a case of fracture through the neck of the humerus. This I am the more inclined to do, because it bears upon a point of practice, the necessity of a cushion in the axilla, which is not always attended to. “ In remarking upon that case, l took occasion to point

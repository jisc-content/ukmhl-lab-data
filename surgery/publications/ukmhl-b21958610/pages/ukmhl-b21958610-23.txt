3 INTRODUCTION. This simple explanation will go far to obviate some of the objections which are occasionally made to military surgery as a separate branch of study. I have sometimes been tempted to think, from the tenor of their observations, that surgeons in civil life were fearful of being thought incompetent to the treatment of wounds, the amputation of limbs, and the man- agement of other complaints which fall to be treated, if not more judiciously, at least more frequently, by the military surgeon. It is not enough for those who have passed an ho- nourable and a useful life in the practice of domestic surgery, to exclaim, “ Is the arm of the hero of the age, or are the arms of his heroic followers, of a different anatomical mould from the limbs of him who guides the plough ?” No mili- tary surgeon will say, in reply, that he ever dreamt of such a distinction ; but he will say with truth, that the arm of his country’s champion is subject to accidents of a kind little known to the ploughman or the labourer; and he will say that these accidents fall to be treated in circumstances totally unknown to the tranquillity of civil life. But it is perhaps rather to the name than to the art, rather to the shadow than to the substance, that this ob- jection has been applied. The term Military Surgery has been considered inappropriate to this department of medicine, as having too limited a signification, where a large pro- portion of the practice, in peaceable times, falls distinctly within the usual province of the physician; but I can see no great impropriety in applying to this subject as a whole a term analogous to that which has at all times and in all countries been applied to its practitioners; it is in- deed by no means unnatural that the art and its professors should have taken their designation from that branch of it which, upon all great and momentous occasions, constitutes its most distinctive feature. But, farther, I maintain, that the education of every man destined for the public service

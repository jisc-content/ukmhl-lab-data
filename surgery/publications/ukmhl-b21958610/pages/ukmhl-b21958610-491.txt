SYPHILIS. 171 These tumours are, for the most part, at first readily move- able under the skin, but as the swelling increases, the integu- ments naturally become more tense, and the tumours more sta- tionary and more painful. The only tumours with which the venereal bubo is likely to be confounded, are scrofulous enlarge- ments of the glands of the groin, swellings of the same glands originating from gonorrhoea, termed sympathetic buboes, and tumours originating from ulcerations and cutaneous erup- tions on the lower extremities. Lumbar abscesses and hernia', both inguinal and femoral, are said to have been mistaken for venereal buboes ; but this is a mistake so obviously the result of ignorance or inattention, that I do not conceive any practi- tioner of common judgment likely to fall into it. Between thctrue venereal and the scrofulous bubo, I regret to say that we do not possess any adequate means of distinction ; the former, however, is in general confined to one gland, is ex- ceedingly painful to the touch, is in general rapid in its pro- gress, and attended with considerable inflammation of the in- teguments. Now in scrofulous affections, tumours are frequent- ly distinguishable in more than one of the inguinal glands, and occasionally also in other parts of the body. These tumours are much less painful ; they are more moveable under the inte- guments ; their progress is slower, and attended with less in- flammation on the surface; at the same time they frequently acquire a much larger size than what the venereal bubo reach- es. In cases of gonorrhoea, when the inflammation runs high, and when the habit is irritable, swellings frequently occur in the glands of the groin, which arc difficult to be dis- tinguished from syphilitic buboes: they are chiefly to be known by the absence of chancres, and by observing whether or not they correspond in their origin, progress, and decline, with the extent of the urethral inflammation. Ulcerations and cutaneous eruptions on the inferior extremities, sometimes give rise to enlargements of the glands of the groin, which are

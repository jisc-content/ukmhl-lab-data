SYPHILIS. 179 adds, with much truth, “ that whatever plan may be pursued, these eruptive phenomena will eventually disappear ; but where they continue to linger for a long time, and are at- tended with their usual accompaniments, languor, debility, and disturbed rest, I neither know, nor can I understand the advantage of delaying that remedy, which repeated experience has taught me to rely upon, that is, mercury.” Inflammation of the iris has already been noticed as a se- condary symptom of syphilis, and for much valuable infor- mation upon this as well as gonorrhoeal and syphilitic inflam- mations of the eye generally, I must refer to Mr. Lawrence’s recent “ Treatise on the Venereal Diseases of the Eye.” Fo these affections of the superficial or soft parts some- times succeed long-continued and severe pain in the bones, terminating occasionally in permanent thickening of the pe- riosteum, in solid and considerable enlargements of the sub- stance of the bone, or eventually in caries. The progress of these affections is, however, slower in proportion to the lower degree of organization in the parts concerned, and they ge- nerally supervene, at the distance even of months, from the date of the primary affection. The true Syphilitic node, as this kind of swelling is termed, is a solid enlargement of the substance of the bone, apparently commencing in this tex- ture, and not in its incipient state, nor for some time after- wards, attended by any discolouration of the integuments. It is in general an indolent swelling, possessing little of the in- flammatory character, increasing by slow degrees, and often exciting but little pain till considerably advanced in size. The most common seats of these nodes are those bones and parts of bones which lie immediately under the integuments, as the cranium, the clavicle, the sternum, and fore part of the tibia. Swellings of these bones, however, or of the periosteum cover- ing them, occasionally appear independently of a venereal origin ; but in such cases there is, from the commencement,

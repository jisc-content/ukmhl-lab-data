BURNS. 143 IThcse subdivisions have been carried much farther by some vwriters, particularly the French, and in the edition of Sabat- : tiere’s Medecine Operatoire, lately published under the inspec- tion of Dupuytren, no fewer than six divisions or degrees of bbums are pointed out; but this minute subdivision of dis- ease, is more calculated to distract the surgeon’s attention ; than to benefit the patient. Where a difference in the symp- toms of a disease, or in the nature of an injury, leads to : the employment of a different line of practice, let it by all means be noted, and on every occasion attended to ; but to change our prescriptions for every minute shade in the ap- pearance of disease, would be equally impossible and equally futile as to change them for every variety in the complexion or in the features of the human face. It is obvious that all tthe three degrees of burning above noticed may, and very i often do, result from the same accident; indeed it is perhaps (only the first degree of burning which can exist alone, for the (occurrence of the greater mischief necessarily implies the pre- i cedence or simultaneous existence of the less ; the second is often accompanied by the occurrence of the first contiguous : to it, and the third by the occurrence of the two former de- . grees in the parts adjacent. It is, however, altogether unnecessary for our purpose to enter farther into the classification of burns, more particularly ‘ as ^as obviously been founded upon the appearances to t seen in those burns, originating from the common accidents ; of dvil life’ from the contact of boiling liquids, or the com- > bustion of the patients clothing. In all cases the pain of uins is exceedingly acute, and perhaps more so in those ' Cases where ic is confined to the surface of the skin, than w iere the texture of this is completely destroyed ; where the urnt suiface is extensive, the accident is not unffequently tended with convulsions, and in them the patient sometimes

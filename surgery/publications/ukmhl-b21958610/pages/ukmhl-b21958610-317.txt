207 WOUNDS OF THE HEAD. 7 compression are often more obvious than in civil life ; and it is so far fortunate for the army surgeon, that a large proportion of those cases of injuries of the brain which come under his no- tice, are accompanied with wounds of the integuments of the head, admitting an examination of the bone, and enabling him to ascertain immediately whether the symptoms depend upon depression ; for if such depression docs occur, it must he immediately under, or contiguous to the part struck. Although what are called counter-fractures, or fractures which occur in a part of the cranium distant from that which received the blow, are capable of producing pressure on the brain, in consequence of the laceration of vessels or the subse- quent formation of matter, yet such counter-fractures arc never in the first instance attended with depression, and do not re- quire immediate operation. In a very large proportion of such cases, the mischief is situated towards the basis of the cranium, totally beyond the reach of the trepan, and almost necessarily fatal. Indeed it has been stated by Mr. Earle, and in part confirmed by the experience of Mr. Brodic, that the fracture in cases of contre-coup, generally passes through the occipital hone, and only happens where the blow seems to have operated in such a manner as to impel the oc- ciput forcibly against the atlas. Cases, however, do occur in military practice, and much more frequently in civil life, where without any severe or very conspicuous appearance of mjury externally, symptoms of oppressed brain supervene, the patient never recovering from the first effects of the blow. Here concussion and extravasation arc simultaneous, or at least the effects of the one supervene before those of the other have subsided ; and when we have no distinct mark to indicate the precise seat of the injury, the case becomes ex- tremely perplexing. If a patient recovers bis senses and powers of motion after the infliction of a blow on the head, and within a few hours afterwards becomes again affected

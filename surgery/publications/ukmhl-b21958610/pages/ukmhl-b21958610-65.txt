DIET, CLOTHING, AND EXERCISE OF TROOPS. 45 where the regiment was then stationed, to Madras, on purpose to represent to the government the distress of his men, and to suggest the expediency of a supply of flannel shuts, d his he did with so much effect, backed by the late Dr. Anderson, the Physician-General, that the flannels were immediately ordered, and, in my opinion, contributed much to check the alarming progress of the disease. In some instances the very mode of cleaning the soldier's clothing has been a means of inducing disease; thus the cleaning of the white trowsers with wet pipe clay, and put- ting them on before they are thoroughly dry, is apt to occasion rheumatic attacks, of which I have seen numerous instances.

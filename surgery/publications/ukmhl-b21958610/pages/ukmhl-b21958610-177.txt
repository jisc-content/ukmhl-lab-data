These symptoms arc familiarly known as incident to s seamen upon long voyages, and particularly when confined to ; salted meat with a scanty allowance of vegetable or farinace- < ous matters. Such were formerly the disastrous consequences 1 from the prevalence of scurvy, that Sir Richard Hawkins, a (distinguished commander in the time of Queen Elizabeth, ; states, that in the course of twenty years, he had known ten i i thousand men perish from this disease, out of the compara- i tively limited establishment of those days. Numerous in- • stances are recorded of the losses and miscarriages of naval en- j i terprises from this cause, but fortunately for the seamen of the present day, the antidote is as well known as the disease itself. The use of lime juice in sea scurvy is by no means so novel a practice as many imagine. Nothing can be more explicit than the recommendation given of this medicine by Woodall, two hundred years ago, “ I finde we have many good things that heale the scurvy well at land, but the sea chirurgeon shall do little good at the sea with them, neither will they in- dure. The use of the juyee of lemmons is a precious medi- cine, and well tried; being sound and good, let it have the cliiefe place, for it will deserve it. It is to be taken each morning, two or three spoonfuls, and fast after it two horus; and if you adde one spoonful of aqua vitae thereto, to a cold stomach it is the better. Some chirurgeons also give of this juyee daily to the men in health, as a preservative ; which course is good if they have store, otherwise it were best to keep it for need. I dare not write how good a sauce it is at meat, least the chicfc in the ships waste it in the great cabins to save vinegar.” It was not, however, until 1794, that the lime- juice was successfully recommended to the government by the naval surgeons of the day, and liberally supplied at the public expense, as a means of prevention.

m STRICTURES. traction of the canal, with fainting, shivering, even convul- sions, and other distressing symptoms. Three varieties of stricture have generally been enumerated by systematic writers : the spasmodic, which is represented as of occasional occurrence, and capable of dilatation to the natural size of the urethra ; the permanent or organic, which admits not of rapid dilatation ; and the mixed, which partakes of the nature ol both. Of the existence of the first, of a pure spasmo- dic stricture, I am somewhat sceptical, unless we are to consi- der as such the obstinate contraction of the muscular fibres surrounding the orifice of the bladder; at least I can assert, that I have never observed a pure spasmodic action of the urethia anterior to that part ol it which is covered by the acceleratores urina?, and have never seen a spasmodic action so complete as to resist the progress of a catheter or bougie until it leached the neck of the bladder. The formation of a permanent stricture is explained by Soemmering, Delpech, Richerand, and other eminent foreign surgeons, as occasioned by a thickening of the diseased part; and these writers do not appear to entertain any belief in the spasmodic nature of such cases. Sir C. Bell very justly observes, that the white con- densed substance which forms the most common kind of stric- ture is incapable of yielding to spasmodic action, ami that, even if the diseased part of the urethra were originally muscu- lar and contractile, the condensation and callosity of the part must be attended with loss ol such contractile power. The condensation of the structure of the urethra, or deposi- tion of adventitious matter within its substance, which alone I consider as constituting stricture, does not always take place round the whole circumference of the canal equally, but is often confined to one side of it, throwing the passage to the opposite side. 1 he disease occasionally occupies but a small portion of the canal, in some instances extending no farther than if the part had been surrounded with a pack-thread; in other cases, and

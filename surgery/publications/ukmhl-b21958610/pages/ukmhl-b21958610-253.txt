233 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. or if a large nerve has been injured, the sense of numbness -s superseded by a distinct, sometimes even an acute feeling :>f pain, with loss of motion in the member. If, in addition to his, the bone should be broken or extensively shattered, the oatient loses the command of the distal part of the limb, or ■becomes unable to support himself upon it. In severe and complicated injuries of this kind, more particularly those from .large shot, we often see the whole nervous system implicated n the accident, so as to produce a complete constitutional •.hock. This however varies exceedingly according to the pa- rent's natural temperament, or his peculiar state of suscepti- bility at the time of receiving the wound. Some men, upon he receipt of even a moderate injury, are instantly seized with i deadly paleness ; profuse perspiration breaks out, vomiting •occurs, and an irresistible tremor affects the limbs ; in short a ■omplete shock, the “ ebranlcment” of the French writers, akes place: other men will receive a much more severe in- ■iury, amounting to the complete comminution, shattering, or emoval of a limb, without betraying any symptom of mental r bodily agitation; and even reason coolly about the conse- quences of the accident, or vent their rage upon the source iff it. 1 lus constitutional shock, this ebranlement above described, anes as much in duration as in severity, in different cases j ome lndnuluals regain almost immediately their coolness nd self-possession, become speedily reconciled to the injury uustained, and prepared, if necessary, to submit to any opera- tion. Others continue for hours under a degree of nervous gitation and tremor which nothing can abate, which no as- urance of their ultimate safety can calm, which renders them otally unfit to undergo an operation should this be thought lecessary, and which indeed often subsides but with life. A icrson labouring under this nervous tremor and agitation has •o much the appearance of being panic-struck, so much docs

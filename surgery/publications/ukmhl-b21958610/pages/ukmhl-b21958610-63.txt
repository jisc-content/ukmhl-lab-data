DIET, CLOTHING, AND EXERCISE OF TROOPS. 43 a surgeon has it in his power to recommend, or a command- ing officer to enforce. In adverting to this subject on a former occasion, I hinted my desire of seeing a register of deaths kept in every regiment, calculated to show, amongst other interesting particulars, the proportion which the deaths of the orderly and well-behaved soldiers bear to the drunken and dissipated. This might, perhaps, eventually, be turned to some account, in restraining those excesses so prejudicial to the character, to the discipline, and, above all, to the health of the soldier. Upon the subject of clothing, I conceive it unnecessary to extend my remarks far; the exterior appearance of troops in their dress and appointments is considered so exclusively the business of the commanding-officer, that the suggestions of the surgeon are not, perhaps, likely to meet with either attention or respect; nevertheless, occasions do occur on which defects, either in the quantity, quality, make, or timely supply of clothing, may materially affect the health of the troops ; and in every such case it falls within the legitimate province of the surgeon to make a respectful representation to his com- manding-officer on the subject. The great purpose of cloth- ing in these climates is to protect our bodies from the cold; and the principal objects of attention in constructing the soldier’s dress, are to procure a due degree of warmth while he is not burdened by an unnecessary weight, and to take care that he is not hampered by an undue constriction of his limbs, or cramped in his motions by tight ligatures around the joints. These objects are by no means incompatible with that uniformity of appearance, and that gay coup d’oeil of a parade so much prized by a military eye ; for the part of military dress in which the surgeon is really most interested is that farthest from becoming an eye-sore to the commanding- officer ; I mean the part of it nearest the soldier’s skin. “ I be experience,” says Sir John Pringle, “which we

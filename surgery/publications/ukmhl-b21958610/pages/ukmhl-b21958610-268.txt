248 MILITARY SURGERY. 1. The bleeding from an artery cut fairly across is much more easily controlled than has been generally supposed. “ All that is required to suppress the torrent, is to place the end of the fore-finger directly against the orifice of the artery, and with the least possible degree of pressure consistent with keeping it steadily in one position, the haemorrhage is sup- pressed.1'1 2. It may be inferred from Mr. Guthrie’s observations, that the office assigned to the sheath of the artery, and the forma- tion of the external coagulum, as described by Jones and pre- viously by Petit, are less uniform and less important than those authors imagined, and that the contraction of the artery itself is on the other hand more complete and influential. Mr. Guthrie has frequently observed, particularly in cases of limbs carried away, or arteries torn across by shells or can- non shot, that a contraction of the divided end of the ar- tery takes place, and “ is confined in the first instance to its very extremity, so that the barrier opposing the flow of blood is formed by this part alone.” The tube of the vessel sub- sequently contracts to some extent upwards, in the shape of a French claret bottle, and a coagulum is formed within it, as described by Dr. Jones. 3. There is reason to think that the retraction and con- traction in the lower end of a di vided artery, are less complete and less permanent than in its upper end, and that the inter- nal coagulum is also less perfectly formed. “ It is a very curious and interesting fact, that the lower end of a divided artery is more prone to secondary haemorrhage than the upper, so much so indeed, that when it occurs after having been ar- rested for four hours, it takes place in all probability from the lower end.” How far these steps in the natural suppression of hemor- rhage are modified by the application of a ligature, we shall have immediate occasion to consider; meantime, I may re-

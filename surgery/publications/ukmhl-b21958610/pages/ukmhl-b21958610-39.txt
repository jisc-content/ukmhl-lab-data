INTRODUCTION. 19 the lapse of a hundred and fifty years, terminated in confirm- ing the maxim so distinctly laid down by "Wiseman. Two years after the appearance of Wiseman’s chirurgical treatises, “ A complete Discourse on W ounds, both general and particular ; as also, a Treatise on Gun-shot Wounds in general,” was published at London, by John Brown, sworn chirurgeon in ordinary to king Charles II. This is a work of considerable learning, and is illustrated by a reference to the author’s experience in the navy, during the Dutch war of 1665, in which he was severely wounded. From this period until 1744, we have no express treatise of any note on the subject of wounds, which I have hitherto been considering as more particularly the province of military surgery. In this year a small treatise on the method of treating gun-shot wounds, was published by John Ranby, prin- cipal serjeant-surgeon to king George II. ; a second edition of this work appeared in 1760, containing the result of the au- thor’s observations while he had the honour of attending his majesty to the wars in Germany. “ This work,” says he, “ was penned in a camp, and was intended to recommend plentiful bleeding very early in the treatment of gun-shot wounds, to advise likewise the application of light easy dress- ings to them, and particularly to introduce the signal use of the bark.” The next English writer who falls to be noticed, is one whose physiological and surgical talents have elicited so many compliments, that the language of panegyric is nearly exhaust- ed in his praise. I shall readily be anticipated in mentioning the name of John Hunter, whose imperishable work on “ The Blood, Inflammation, and Gun-shot Wounds,” was publish- ed in 1794, and contains observations drawn from the author’s experience while serving as staff-surgeon at Belleisle, and in Portugal; subsequently to which he was appointed surgeon- general to the army, and inspector of regimental infirmaries.

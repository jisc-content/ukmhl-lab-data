178 MILITARY SURGERY. several of the continental surgeons, under the names of “ pour- riture d’hopital,” and, “ la gangrene humide des hopitaux.” In this country, we have many valuable observations up- on it, under the various appellations of putrid, contagious, malignant, and gangrenous ulcer, hospital sore, and hospital gangrene, by which name it is generally known to Eng- lish surgeons. As this is a disease with which I am per- sonally but little familiar, I shall proceed to notice in succes- sion the peculiar views adopted and the treatment recom- mended by some of the most distinguished writers upon this subject during the last fifty years. Reverting more particularly to the writings of Pouteau, whose personal sufferings have been already noticed, it is to be remark- ed, that in the second of two memoirs published by this author, “ Sur la Gangrene Humide des Hopitaux,'1 after a descrip- tion of the local appearances of the disease, he goes on to ob- serve, that the cause of the gangrene acts upon the affected spot by insertion, and upon the whole animal economy by a subsequent reaction. He then proceeds to recommend, as a local remedy, the actual cautery; or should the pusillanimity of the patient, or perhaps that of the surgeon, revolt at the cautery, we are to substitute boiling oil, or some medicinal me- lange susceptible of a heat yet greater than oil. The consti- tutional fever which accompanies this disease, he considers as of a malignant character ; and hence he speaks with reserve of the efficacy of bleeding, calls it a feeble resource, and only to be employed in sanguine temperaments. Bark, and other febrifuges, he considers useless ; but speaks favourably of eme- tics and purgatives ; and above all, he strongly recommends the use of camphor. Dussassoy, the successor of Pouteau at the Hotel Dieu of Lyons, persuaded himself of the great uti- lity of cream of tartar, so as, in the first instance, to ope- rate as a purgative, and subsequently, to produce its diuretic effects.

MILITARY SURGERY. 521 this punishment depends greatly upon the age and strength of the drum-boys, and upon their practice in this part of their duty. Upon the number of lashes which a man may receive without endangering his life, it is extremely difficult to speak with precision ; and it is very remarkable, that in cases where death has occurred, it has generally been from punishments of limit- ed extent. Five hundred lashes with the common army cats may be considered a very full punishment. And although in former times I have seen many men receive more than this number, yet such punishments are generally to be considered as hazardous.

The lashes fire here apportioned by dozens, and being inflicted by the

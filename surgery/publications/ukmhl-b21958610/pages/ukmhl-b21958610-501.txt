In fine, all that my own experience in the treatment of nodes enables me to say is this, that w'hen they have suc- ceeded to primary venereal sores, in the treatment of which little mercury has been employed, and when they possess an indolent character, with little or no superficial inflamma- tion, the dispersion ol these swellings will often be promot- ed by a judicious course of mercury, confinement within doors, warm bathing, and attention to the general health, with the local use of leeches, blisters, and stimulating lini- ments, one of the best of which is the camphorated mer- curial liniment of the pharmacopoeia chirurgica. But when nodes appear in a very advanced stage of the disease, when mercury has been given irregularly or profusely, when the constitution is broken by dissipation or maltreatment, we must be exceedingly guarded in the use of mercury, and our efforts must be chiefly directed to the restoration of the ge- neral health, treating the local symptom according to its in- flammatory or indolent character by soothing or stimulant ap- plications. The following sentiments of Mr. Carmichael upon this point are peculiarly worthy of attention:—“ It must be allowed, that syphilitic nodes by no means yield to mercury with the same regularity and quickness as the con- stitutional affections of the surface of the body ; a circum- stance most probably owing to the organization of the bones, which is so low, that the strongest mercurial action in the skin and throat may be accompanied by a very weak 2 i one in

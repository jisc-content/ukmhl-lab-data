WOUNDS AND FRACTURES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 369 whom has met with an instance of this variety. Of its treat- ment I speak with great diffidence, because I speak without any personal experience ; but I am disposed to think that in most cases the tendency of the limb to deviate from the natu- ral position will be best counteracted by keeping it in the extended posture by a common long splint, or by means of Boyer’s, Desault’s, or Hagedorn’s apparatus. In the third case, that of fracture immediately below the trochanters, the limb ought, I think, uniformly to be placed in the bent position. It has been well observed, that in this instance no modification of the extended posture will answer; for, supposing the patient placed on his back, the powerful action of the psoas magnus and iliacus interims muscles, in- serted into the trochanter minor, will raise, or bend the upper fragment of the bone upon the pelvis, while it is obvious that all attempts to extend, to level, or to depress the inferior frag- ment of the bone will tend to separate the broken ends from each other. I would therefore press upon the surgeon’s attention these three varieties of this accident, as more capable of being re- cognised in practice, and better calculated to lead to a deter- minate and successful mode of treatment. In the first case the position of the limb may be optional, in the second I am inclined to consider the extended posture the best, and in the third the bent position should invariably be adopted. In compound fractures, at least in those occurring from the common accidents of civil life, it may be observed, that in making its way to the surface through the different strata of muscles, some of the fibres must be divided transversely, while others are merely separated longitudinally, by the pro- truding bone, and in relaxing the wounded muscle, we ap- proximate the extremities of those fibres which have been cut across, while we in no degree tend to increase the displace- 2 «

HOSPITALS. 83 tor Kerr; in Sicily, by Deputy-Inspector Somerville; at : the Cape of Good Hope, by Deputy-Inspector Baillie, &c., 'where the savings have been greater than at home; and t there can be no doubt, that if one authority controlled, and one medical regulation pervaded the whole army, the hospital . expenditure, medicines included, might be defrayed from the hospital stoppages.” The rate of diet being in every case appropriated to the na- ture of the disease under which the soldier labours, it no doubt often happens, that what he actually receives, in the shape of aliment, is not equivalent to the amount of his stoppages; but of this he can have no reason to complain, considering that, if reduced either by the nature or duration of his disease to a s state requiring additional nutriment and wine, he is equally I furnished with them, however much their value may exceed i the sum stopped from his pay. On the Indian station, at the : time I served in that country, the hospital stoppages were, and, I believe, still are, only about one half of what is exact- ed on other stations. Why his majesty’s orders, on this head, have not been enforced in India, as well as in every other quarter of the world, I am unable to say; but if the dimi- nished rate of stoppage has been established as an act of be- nevolence to the sick soldier, the object has been completely defeated ; a soldier being able to accumulate money in hos- ] pital, is an evil fraught with the most serious consequences to himself and to the service, by holding out an inducement to him to remain in hospital, and by frequently leading him into excesses on leaving it* Upon home service it is the duty of the surgeon to provide the meat, bread, and every other article of diet required for the sick, at the market price, and of the best possible quality ; the price being ascertained and verified by the commanding- officer of the regiment, whose approving signature is necessary to authenticate the surgeon’s accounts.

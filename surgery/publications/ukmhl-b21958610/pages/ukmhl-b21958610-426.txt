These three stages are, 1. “ The period between the infliction of the injury, and the occurrence of tension, pain, swelling, and symptomatic fever,” a period of greater or less extent, according to the violence of the injury, and the state of the patient’s constitution. 2. “ When the inflam- matory symptoms have commenced, and have given rise to a constitutional affection, or symptomatic fever.” 3. “ When the symptomatic fever and constitutional disturbance have abatedand this is the period recommended by Faure as the most advantageous for the performance of amputation. That this last-mentioned period is more favourable than the second will be readily conceded, although we are decidedly opposed to the opinion which this author seems to entertain, that amputation is not more dangerous after the accession of the inflammatory symptoms than immediately after the re- ceipt of the injury ; and I am equally unprepared to admit what he asserts as a general principle, that the longer the

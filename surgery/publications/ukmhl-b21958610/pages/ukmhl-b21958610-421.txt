401 AMPUTATIONâ€™. 3. Cases of compound and comminuted fractures, particularly those high up in the inferior extremity, and those involving joints. All injuries of the foregoing description which occur in battle, arc, for the most part, prxma facie cases for amputation ; but much depends upon the extent as well as upon the nature of the injury, and much also upon the accommodation and at- tention which a patient is likely to receive. The treatment of sick and wounded in a victorious army, having the command of an abundant country, and at a favourable season of the year, may be in many respects very different from what it would be after a defeat. Wherever limbs, under the circumstances above described, have not been immediately removed, they are liable to fall into gangrene; and it then becomes an important ques- tion whether we should proceed to amputate the limb or await a spontaneous termination of the gangrene. As the cases in support of the practice of amputating during a spreading gangrene are still limited in number, I may be permitted to state particularly the result of my own expe- rience upon this point. I have operated once myself, and have twice seen amputations performed by other surgeons dur- ing a spreading gangrene. Of these three cases, one died soon after the operation, but without any gangrene attacking the stump ; another survived the operation for ten or twelve days, without any return of the gangrene, and, upon dissec- tion, he was found injured internally, one of his ribs was broken, he had effusion into the pericardium, and some small abscesses in the liver ; the third made a perfect recovery : so that, upon the whole, I consider my own experience favour- able to the practice, inasmuch as gangrene did not in any of the above-mentioned instances attack the stump. 1 he proper period for amputation is a question upon which much discussion has taken place, since the use of the tourni- 2 o

38 5 LUXATIONS. luxations, and to prepare himself for their successful treat- ment, he should ever bear in mind, that there is no one instance in which the comfort of a patient, or the reputation of a surgeon, arc more completely and more frequently involved than in the treatment of luxations. Here the popular prejudice is de- cidedly against us, and we often find well informed people ready to lend a willing ear to stories of the superior skill of a country bone-setter. In proportion as a man is eminent in the other departments of his profession, he is very frequently sup- posed to be ignorant of this particular department; and while I am veiy far from giving the most distant countenance to such an opinion, I cannot divest myself of the knowledge of many mistakes which have happened in the hands of scientific surgeons, and have tended to confirm vulgar pre- judices. Every person knows the superior facility with which luxated bones arc replaced immediately after accidents, and how much all the difficulties of reduction are aggravated by the lapse of time. Much is here to be gained^by accurate knowledge and prompt decision ; much may be lost by doubt and delay. In luxations of long standing, adhesions are formed, and in some instances an ossific deposit is thrown round the extremity of the luxated bone, presenting an almost insupe- rable obstacle to its reduction. A dislocation recently produced, where the head of the bone has escaped from the articular cavity, and retains the position into which it was first thrown, is termed a primary luxation, m contradistinction to those cases termed consecutive disloca- tions, when by the continued action of the muscles'a dislocated bone is drawn into a different position from that which it occupied immediately after the accident. Now as the military surgeon has, for the most part, the advantage of seeing luxa- tions in their primary state, he has not those obstacles to en- counter which are met with in secondary or consecutive dis-

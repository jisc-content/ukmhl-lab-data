In speaking of the treatment of those phagedaenic ul- cers prevalent amongst the Sepoys at Malacca, in 1827- 28, Dr. Ward expresses himself as follows:—“ The treat- ment of the Phagedenic Ulcer varied of course according to the form which it assumed.

The most useful stimulating external applications were the hot dressing, con-

399 AMPUTATION. for which I am almost solely indebted to the valuable account given of this operation by my learned predecessor, Dr. Thom- son. To whom the honour is due of having first advised or per- formed the amputation of a limb, I am unable to say ; but, from the way in which it is spoken of by the older sur- geons, it is obvious that the operation was confined at first to cases of injury followed by gangrene. From their directions to cut below, to cut through, or to cut immediately above the line of separation between the living and the dead parts, it is obvious that they seldom or never thought of primary ampu- tation ; that their operations were all secondary ; that, in short, they only ventured to complete a division which nature had begun. Their imperfect knowledge of the circulation, and of the means of controlling the hemorrhage, rendered it an operation to which they were naturally adverse, while the less formidable nature of the wounds received in battle, pre- vious to the invention of gunpowder, rendered amputation less frequently necessary. The first person by whom we find this operation recommended, in severe injuries of the limbs, is Duchesne, a military surgeon, whose work is dated in 1G25 ; and it is worthy of remark, that he directs the operation to be performed before inflammation and other constitutional symp- toms shall have supervened ; but how long this recommenda- tion remained a barren precept, or by whom it was first actually carried into execution, I have not been able to acertain. It is obvious, however, that after surgeons became familiar â€¢ with the use of the tourniquet, the needle, and ligature, these means equally facilitated the performance of the operation, and rendered its adoption more frequent. Recommended in i ranee by La Charriere and Saviard, it seems to have so fiir captivated the fancy of the junior surgeons, as to have run some risk of being abused. The number of amputations in

229 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. There is no end to the examples on record of the singular , directions which balls are found to take in their course through i different parts of the body; nor is it possible from seeing the entrance and exit of a ball to judge what the parts ; are which it has injured in its passage, or what parts may I have escaped. While daily instances occur of musket or (carbine halls, buttons, pieces of coin, or other articles being c carried into or lodged in parts of the body distant from their l entrance, we have examples of masses of a very extraordinary iand almost incredible size being lodged in a limb. The im- mense rapidity with which these bodies are propelled, not only forces them into the soft parts, but compacts these parts to- gether, while the space they originally occupied is filled by the projected body. The elasticity also of the parts allows of 'Substances of a very large size to pass in without the external i orifice in any degree corresponding to the size of the body ; rmusket balls often leaving an orifice which, without stretching, •would not admit more than a common bougie. It is to be observed, however, that this remark applies only to the soft [parts of the body, or to the spongy extremities of the long bones; for in passing through the flat bones, as for in- stance, the upper parts of the cranium, the scapula, or the ilium, the aperture made by a ball is often larger in diameter than the ball itself. From want of due atten- tion to this point, we have a curious instance of an er- roneous judgment formed by one of the tribunals in France, before which a prisoner was tried for murder, and was ac- quitted, because the hole made by a ball in passing through the ilium was found to be eight lines, while the diameter of the prisoner’s musket was only six and a half. As if a case bad 'been wanted to shew the absurdity of this verdict, an instance occurred immediately afterwards of the suicide of an officer of the Gendarmerie ; and here the hole made in the parietal bone >by the discharge of a cavalry pistol was found not only to (x-

MILITARY SURGERY. 56 lated may be heated by respiration, or otherwise, the more certainly will a circulation of air be established through it; and the superiority of this plan over that where the ventila- tion depends chiefly or solely upon windows placed at the or- dinary height from the floor is obvious, for they operate di- rectly only upon the purest part of the air of a room, viz. the middle-layers. A great advantage of this plan of ventilating, which is more fully detailed in my introductory lectures published some years ago, is, that it does not interfere in any degree with the means already established, and that it may be introduced at a very trifling expense into buildings already erected for barracks, or occasionally occupied as such. But the great and leading advantage which attends the mode of ventilating barracks by means of the air occupying the passages and lob- bies is, that we have the supply completely under the control of the military or medical officer at all times and in all sea- sons, constantly existing within the building itself, let the storm rage how it may without. Before concluding this subject, I have only to observe that the mode of ventilating barracks by perforations in the walls and passage-floors, is merely a modification or extension of the plan of ventilating hospitals recommended by Dr. Donald Monro, in his £< Health of Soldiers,” so long ago as 1762 ; and of its practical utility, examples are to be found in the Bristol Infirmary, fitted up on the suggestion of the late Mr. Howard, and in the wards of some of the temporary barrack hospitals in England; amongst others which I have seen was that at Hastings in Sussex : while in foreign coun- tries, several examples are to be found of barracks, hospitals, and workhouses ventilated in the same way; thus the Ca- serne of St. Elizabeth at Brussels, the hospital of the Je- suits in the same city, and the workhouse at Amsterdam. In guardhouses, which are frequently crowded with prisoners

TETANUS. 285 from a paper by Dr. Dickson in the Medico-Chirurgical Transac- tions, that tetanus was much less common in the fleet in the West India islands of late years than formerly, yet we know, that after the action at Copenhagen in 1801, as large a pro- portion of tetanic cases occurred in the fleet as after any land- battle whatever. Our treatment of tetanus, it must be admitted, is, in gene- ral, as unsuccessful as our pathology is imperfect; but it is proper to state, that with a view of subduing this intractable malady, bloodletting, purgatives, cold and warm bathing, opium, mercury, camphor, musk, tobacco, digitalis, wine, ardent spirits, and many other remedies have been recom- mended. Nothing, however, can more clearly prove the want of an effecual remedy for the disease, than the enumeration of a list of articles, many of them so opposite in their effects. Were I to specify any one of the above articles, of which I think more highly than another, it would be opium; which may be exhibited in this disease, to an extent to which in other cases we would not think of pushing it. I have given it to the extent of two grains every hour, which is per- haps the smallest dose from which we can expect any bene- fit ; and if from a relaxation of the spasms, while at the same time no appearance of coma or delirium occurs, we are encouraged to persevere in the exhibition of opium, the dose may be greatly increased, taking care to obviate costiveness by the exhibition of powerful purgatives and glys- ters, amongst which the turpentine and tobacco injections are particularly recommended. As proofs of the extent to which opium may be given with safety in cases of tenanus, I may refer to a case stated by Dr. Mackie of Southampton, in the twentieth volume of the Medical Commentaries, where a pa- tient of fifteen years of age, suffering from tetanus, in con- sequence of a wound in the forearm, took three and a-half ounces of laudanum in the space of twenty-four hours ;

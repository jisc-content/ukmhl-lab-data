79 HOSPITALS. ■struction of an hospital, the leading points he should bear in mind are, to have the hospital so situated with regard to the ■barrack as to prevent the ready access of idle visitors, or in- Jdeed any communication with the exterior which is not autho- rized by the medical officer. The wards should be lofty in the roof, capable of thorough ventilation, and not too large, per- haps those containing from twelve to sixteen patients are the most advantageous. In calculating the accommodation of an hospital, Dr. Hennen estimates that there should be at least six feet by six for each bed, or thirty-six feet square, whatever may be the height of the ward, and the room should in some measure be apportioned to patients agreeably to an estimate of its cubic contents ; thus, a room sixteen feet long, ten broad, and ten high, will contain 1600 cubic feet of air, and is calculated to accommodate two patients ex- tremely well, allowing 800 cubic feet for each; and it s should be a general rule, that when there are any fractional parts above the specific allowance, such fractional parts should be allowed as an equivalent for the portion of air displaced by the bedsteads, tables, forms, &c. Tenon, in his interesting work on the Parisian Hospitals, states, as the proper allowance for each convalescent patient, six and a half cubic toises of air, and seven cubic toises for each sick patient, (each toise being equal to 76-734.English inches ;) which, says he, is the pro- portion in those hospitals where I have found the mortality moderate, “ bu j’ai trouve la mortalite moderee.” The wards ought as much as possible to approach to a rect- angular form, so that the whole of the patients may be ex- ] posed at once to an officer’s eye the moment he enters the ward. All angular projections, recesses, cupboards, &c. ought to be excluded ; every additional crevice or corner is ge- nerally converted into an additional receptacle for filth, and every contrivance of the kind to which I allude is calculated to obstruct the cleaning and ventilation of the wards.

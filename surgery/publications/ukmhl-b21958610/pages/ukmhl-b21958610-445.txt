425 AMPUTATION. the superior extremity, either be compressed by the hand of an assistant, or the hemorrhage may be commanded by the tourniquet; but, in amputating at the hip-joint, this instru- ment is inapplicable, and in originally contemplating this operation, the fear of incontrollable hemorrhage was one of the objections chiefly dwelt upon. It does not fall within my present plan to detail the various methods of operating, many of them devised with a view of obviating hemorrhage, for, of all the amputations, this is the one in which the cir- cumstances of the case must determine the mode of operating. Like all the other amputations at the joints, it appears to me to be best performed as a flap operation ; and it is a great ad- vantage of the mode which I would recommend, that, while it seems the most eligible mode of forming the flaps, it is also, perhaps, the most effectual mode of commanding the haemor- rhage. Let the limb be transfixed with one of the long amputat- ing knives, entered on the outside of the joint, and carried transversely across in front of the bone; an anterior flap is then to be formed from the muscular substance in the fore- part of the thigh, and as the knife advances downwards, the fingers of an assistant are gradually introduced into the inci- sion behind it, so that he obtains a perfect command of the femoral artery previous to its division; the limb being then forcibly abducted and pressed downwards, the capsular and round ligaments are cut, and the amputation completed by dividing the parts behind the joint. The command of the femoral artery is in this way perfect ; and the better plan is not to lose time in tying this vessel until the arteries in the posterior flap are secured. The anterior flap may either be made of proper dimensions to meet a corresponding flap from behind, or the anterior flap may be prolonged so as to cover the whole face of the stump, the parts behind being cut perpendicularly. This is the only way in which I have ever

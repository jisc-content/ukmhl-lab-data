207 INCISED WOUNDS. i wounds of a greater depth ; and is accomplished by passing a ccurved needle armed with a ligature through the lips of the vwound, and tying the ligature over the line of the incision. The irule laid down by some systematic writers is, in entering tho i needle, to keep as far distant from the edge as the wound is iin depth ; to place the stitches at about an inch distant from teach other, and to secure the intermediate spaces with straps iof adhesive plaster. Some of these directions, drawn per- ! haps from the practice of surgery in civil life, are but little adapted to the formidable wounds which come under the |( care of the military surgeon; and his object should be to study I] how he can best attain his purpose, without being fettered by a reference to the number of lines or inches between his sutures, or their distance from the edges of the wound. The only remaining means of expediting the reunion of incised wounds which remains to be considered, is the use of bandages. In the form and application of these, surgeons have, at different times, exercised as much fancy as in the form of sutures. In justification of this, however, it is to be observed, that the purposes which bandages are calculated to effect, are more numerous than those to which sutures are adapted. In ancient times, we find surgeons talk- ing of an expelling, a propelling, a defensive, and various other bandages ; and, in the preface to the treatise of Galen upon this subject, we find the following methodical enumera- tion of the properties of the roller, “ efficit enim ut quae ab- scesserunt propellantur, hiantia conjungantur, perversia diri- gantur, atquc omnia contraria prestantur.” Although all these things are to be effected by a careful and skilful applica- tion of the roller, yet it is only with that property by which “ hiantia conjungantur,” only with its property as a unit- ing, or what was formerly termed, an incarning bandage, that we are at present concerned ; for this purpose it is often employed in the form of a double-headed roller, having a slit 8

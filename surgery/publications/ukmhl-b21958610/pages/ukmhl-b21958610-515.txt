GONOHRHtEA. 495 out from the posterior part of the canal. Although repeated dissections of the urethra in patients dying while affected with gonorrhoea have shewn that ulceration of the lining mem- brane of this passage is by no means a common occurrence, as was formerly supposed ; yet there is no doubt that ulcers do sometimes form within the orifice. This, I have myself wit- nessed in the living subject, and we have the testimony of the accurate Morgagni, and of others, that they are occasion- ally met with in the dead ; but such ulcers are generally of a syphilitic character, and I may safely assert, that the preva- lent opinion of the present day is against the existence of any such ulcers as a principle source of the gonorrheeal discharge. In the treatment of this disease, particularly in its early and acute stages, we have sometimes to resort to consti- tutional or general, as well as local remedies. General blood- letting is perhaps not so frequently employed in gonorrhoea, as it ought to be. Analogies have often been remarked between ophthalmia and gonorrhoea; and in no case per- haps would this analogy hold good, more completely than in the beneficial effects of blood-letting, were we enabled to adopt it at the same early period, and to push it to the same extent in gonorrhoea as has sometimes been successfully done in the treatment of acute ophthalmia ; but this, for obvious reasons, does not happen. Gonorrhoea does not prevail to the same formidable extent, the knowledge of its accession is ne- cessarily confined in the first instance to the patient alone; it is not, unless greatly mismanaged, attended with the risk of so much permanent injury to the individual, nor does it naturally excite the same degree of interest and activity on the part 01 a medical officer as ophthalmia, Krona these cir- cumstances, the most favourable time for the employment of bleeding in gonorrha a is often allowed to pass ; and it is only wheii the violence of the attack is such as at once to incapaci- tate the individual for his duties, and to compel him to resort

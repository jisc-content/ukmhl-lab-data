554 MILITARY SURGERY. dysentery, would naturally be inclined to make light of any case in which this was not remarkable, and might thus lose the best opportunity of being useful to his patient. Prepos- sessed with the idea of the disease being contagious, he might waste his time in useless precautions, or deprive his help- less patient of that assistance from others, of which dysenteric cases stand so much in need. Adopting the idea of scybalae lodging in the bowels, he might be induced to persevere in the repetition of purgatives, which, in some circumstances and stages of this disease, I hold to be much worse than useless. The remote causes of dysentery in India are conceived to be heat, particularly when combined with moisture ; the im- moderate and indiscriminate use of fruits; the abuse of spi- rituous liquors ; exposure to currents of wind and to noxious night-dews; and in whatever way these causes may act in the production of dysentery, we are assured by Dr. Johnson, that in every case of the disease which has come within his observation, two functions were invariably disordered from the very outset, and soon drew other derangements in their train. These were the functions of the skin and of the liver, and “ I defy,” says he, “ any one who has minutely regarded this disease at the bed-side, to produce a single instance in which these functions were carried on in a natural manner at any period of the disease.” But referring to Dr. Johnsons work on the “ Influence of Tropical Climates on European Constitutions,” for a full account of his ingenious views up- on this subject, I proceed to observe, that I have been strong- ly impressed with a belief in the existence of two distinct forms of dysentery as it occurs in India. The one is an acute disease, confined chiefly to the large intestines, and denominated by some of the Indian practitioners colonitis, a term which does not necessarily imply the existence of a flux, but corresponds extremely well with the appearances on dissection ; the other is a more chronic form of disease,

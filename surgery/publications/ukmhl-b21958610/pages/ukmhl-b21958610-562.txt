Of this, again, we who live amongst yellow fever, not only know nothing, but we see it Contradicted by the daily experience of our lives.‚Äù These two points, then, the contagious nature of the yel- low fever, and the non-liability to a second attack, being, in my opinion, so completely disproved by Dr. Bancroft, I must now be permitted to observe, that I see no difference, except in degree, between this scourge of the West Indies and the bi- lious remittent, which I have so often seen at Batavia, at Prince of Wales Island, at Seringapatam, and in various other parts of the East. That a yellow fever under certain circumstances, under great accumulation and concentration of its victims, may not become contagious, is what I am not pre- pared to assert; but I may safely affirm, that I have seen nu- merous fevers, to all intents and purposes yellow, so far as the colour of the skin is concerned, and fevers also with black vo- miting, which were not attended with any circumstances giv- ing rise to a suspicion of contagion ; nor were patients who had suffered an attack of this fever by any means exempted from a second accession. In short, between the yellow fever of the West, as described by numerous writers, and the bilious remittent of the East, I see every possible point of resem- blance ; and I can see no possible difference but what may be accounted for by season, by local peculiarities, or particular idiosyncrasis. With this opinion of the identity of marsh fevers in all tropi- cal regions, I proceed to offer a few remarks on the symptoms and treatment of the yellow or bilious remittent fever of warm climates, premising, thatlhold it entirely foreign to the province of this chair to enter into any exposition of the theory of fever in general, or any lengthened detail of its pathology and cure. Yellow fever, like all other diseases, differs greatly accord- ing to the intensity of its exciting cause, the peculiar situation of the patient, and his natural habit of body. It occurs in

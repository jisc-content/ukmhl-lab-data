YELLOW FEVER. 547 to strangers recently arrived from temperate climates; most of them young, vigorous, and robust. Its first stage is obvi- ously one of great excitement, the indications of which are a hard, full, and strong pulse, a distressing sense of universal tension, a red starting eye, and parched skin; while those who have fallen victims to the disease have generally exhibited, on dissection, traces of inflammation in various organs, especially in the head and stomach.

Youth, plethora, vigour, and a recent arrival from Europe, are circumstances which, in the opinion of many of our Indian practitioners, will alone justify the em-

The fragments of this artillery, the stones, the men, or pieces of them, were scattered pcle-mele by the explosion, and fell here and there from a height more or less considerable. Many of the vic- tims of this frightful catastrophe had already ceased to exist at the moment of ascension ; others met their death in falling upon the rocks. Some were mutilated of one or more mem- bers, others were burned over the whole surface of the body, or in the principal regions ; some, with whom the commotion had been violent, or in whom the burn extended to the viscera of the lower belly, died a few hours after their entrance into the ambulance. I was obliged to amputate both the thighs of one of the soldiers who survived this disaster. Besides the sphacelus of the two limbs, produced by the total disorganiza- tion of the parts, he had the face, the breast, and the hands burnt; but notwithstanding the loss of his two extremities, and the enormous burnings with which he was covered, this brave soldier was saved and completely cured.” In such cases as these, the constitutional treatment adapted to the more severe injury, is equally appropriate to the lesser; and from the multifarious local remedies which have been re- commended for the cure of burns, we are to select those best suited to the complicated nature of the accident. Burns have been divided by systematic writers into three different classes or degrees : those which merely produce a superficial redness and inflammation on the surface, terminat- ing in resolution, and healing without the detachment of the cuticle,—those which affect the vitality of the cutis, accom- panied with the elevation of the cuticle into vesicles or blisters, and producing suppuration on the surface of the true skin—and thirdly, those where the whole thickness of the skin, and even the subjacent parts, are affected by the injury, lead- ing to the formation of a slough or eschar, which must ne- cessarily be detached before a cure can be accomplished.—

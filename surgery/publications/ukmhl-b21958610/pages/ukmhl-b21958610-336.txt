MILITARY SURGERY. 31G believe, that in all wounds penetrating the thorax, the whole lung of the wounded side must immediately and inevitably collapse. Others again have stated, as an antithesis to this, that in many such cases, a portion of the lung protrudes from the wound, forming a species of hernia. Both these occur- rences do occasionally take place, but of the particular circum- stances which lead to the one or to the other, I am unable to speak with precision ; and nothing can be more erroneous than to represent either of them as a uniform or necessary conse- quence of such wounds. Other writers, affecting a degree of precision which nature does not always choose to follow, have asserted, that when openings are made into both sides of the thorax, exceeding in diameter the area of the glottis, and thus admitting of the entrance of more air by the wounds than by the trachea, that both lungs must inevitably collapse, that breathing must cease, and the patient die. This view of the matter, which has been advanced with confidence, and thought to afford a ready solution of the different results of wounds penetrat- ing the thorax, will not be easily admitted by those who are acquainted with the singular recoveries which the records of surgery contain, from cases of punctures with the small sword or bayonet, to those where the cavities of the chest have been opened by musket balls passing through the thorax. That wounds even of this desperate kind are not, as has been supposed, instantly fatal, we have recent and interesting proofs in Meniere’s “L’Hotel Dieu de Paris en Juillet et Aout 1830."’ I have already observed, that the immediate danger of penetrating wounds of the thorax is from internal haemorrhage, marked by an extreme sense of oppression and faintness, an increasing difficulty of breathing, a tickling cough, and very frequently bloody expectoration. This last symptom has been generally enumerated as one of those most characteristic of wounds of the lungs* Wherever these organs are penetrated

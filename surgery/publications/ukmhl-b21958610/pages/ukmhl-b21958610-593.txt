LIVER DISEASE. 573 what the state of the pulse, the height of the symptoms, or the habit of the patient would seem to demand, and of such practice I have never had occasion to repent. I do not how- ever mean to allege, that bleeding will altogether supersede the necessity of mercury, but that in the acute form these should at least go hand in hand, and that the latter should be pushed to the extent of producing ptyalism with the least possible delay. In the chronic form of the disease, it is to mercury we must chiefly trust for the re-establishment of a healthy action in the liver, and the restoration of healthy secretions. The relief experienced, in many cases of chronic hepatitis, so soon as the mercury affects the mouth, is truly surprising; the removal of all uneasy feelings from the side, the comparative clearness of the patientâ€™s skin and visage, the return of natural evacuations, and the removal of every complaint but debility, abundantly evince the powers of this remedy. In either form of hepatitis, smart and habitual purging will materially promote the objects we have in view ; and, in this instance, the preference so generally given to calomel in India, is, I believe, well founded. A few grains of this preparation over night, with a solution of some of the neutral salts on the following morning, is what I was in the habit of employing; and when by these means copious evacuations are procured, they seldom fail of producing beneficial effects, relieving the indescribable sense of tension, stuffing, and oppression about the region of the liver, and making the patient feel compara- tively light, easy, and cheerful, so that we have seldom any difficulty in persuading him to repeat them as often as they become necessary. Leeches, blisters, and setons, are all well known and highly useful auxiliaries in the treatment of liver complaints ; but upon the virtues of these it seems to me un- necessary here to enlarge.

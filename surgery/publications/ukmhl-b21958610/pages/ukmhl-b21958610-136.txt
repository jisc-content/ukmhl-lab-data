116 MILITARY SURGERY. of them operates individually in modifying the phenomena of local disease. The local causes which give rise to inflammation have been subdivided into those of a mechanical and those of a chemical nature; amongst the former are to be reckoned wounds of all de- scriptions, contusions, fractures, and even simple pressure: the effect of this last is often manifested in a way highly annoy- ing to the surgeon, as in those cases of accident or disease which necessarily confine a patient for a length of time to one position, and where those points upon which the weight of the body rests become in the first instance inflamed, and sub- sequently ulcerate, or mortify. Those mechanical causes of in- flammation to which soldiers are more particularly exposed, are incised, punctured, lacerated, and contused wounds ; the presence of foreign bodies, forcibly introduced and lodged in different parts of the system, as balls, splinters of shells or gun- carriages, &c. There arc many other substances capable of ex- citing inflammation in those places to which they are applied, without any obvious mechanical operation, and these constitute the class of chemical causes ; amongst these may be enume- rated extremes of temperature, both as to heat and cold, con- centrated acids, acrid vegetable and animal poison, blisters, and rubefacients; those from which the soldier is more parti- cularly liable to suffer, arc the intense heat of the sun in some climates, and explosions of gunpowder, a cause which often acts both chemically and mechanically. We may also mention a cause the very reverse of these in its nature, but in some cir- cumstances equally certain in its effects, I mean the applica- tion of cold. Our springs in this country, noted for their frequent changes of temperature, are well known to be peculiarly pro- ductive of inflammatory attacks of the mucous membranes of the nose, the fauces, and the bronchia:, while climates re-

206 MILITARY SURGERY. diminish the number of cases in which sutures are considered to be admissible. Of all the varied forms of sutures, upon the description of which our predecessors dwelt with so much complacency, and of which formal representations are to be seen in the plates of Heister, Benjamin, and John Bell, and various other writers, two only are now in common use ; these are the twisted and the interrupted suture : the former is accomplished by passing a straight needle, or a silver pin, transversely through the lips of the wound; and then twisting a thread round it, so as to re- tain the lips of the wound in very accurate apposition. This is a form of suture more extensively applicable than what is generally thought; its application indeed in wounds extend- ing transversely either across the trunk or extremities is dif- ficult, but in many longitudinal wounds of the same parts it may with great propriety be employed. It has the advantage of preventing the lips of the wound from moving longitudinally upon each other ; the points of the wound being once brought into contact must necessarily remain in the most accurate appo- sition ; and no slipping or gliding of the edges past each other can here take place. This is a suture with which military sur- geons particularly should make themselves familiar, from the ease with which it can in most cases be put in practice ; a com- mon sewing needle, or even a well tinned pin, and a thread are to be found in almost every situation; and with these the twisted suture may be always effected. It is every day executed, with a pin and a few horse hairs, for securing the wound made by tbe phlegm in the necks of horses, for the pur- pose of blood-letting. This suture is found particularly useful in all wounds of the lips, whether accidental or intentional, as in the operation for hare-lip, and has been so commonly employ- ed in the latter as to acquire the name of the hare-lip suture. The interrupted suture is more applicable to transverse wounds than the twisted suture ; it is also applicable to

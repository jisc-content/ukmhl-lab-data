MILITARY SURGERY. 332 is proper to remove them, but this should never be done at the expense of adding much to the patient’s present suffering, or of aggravating the subsequent inflammation: it should be recollected that numerous instances are on record, of balls, and also pointed weapons, having passed through the cavity of the abdomen, without apparently wounding any of the convolutions of the intestines. In other instances, balls, after having penetrated the parietes, have passed round the internal contour of the cavity, and have subsequently made their exit at a dis- tant point, or remained lodged within the belly, whence they have afterwards been discharged by abscess, or by the natural outlets. With the knowledge of these facts, no one will waste his own time, or aggravate his patient’s sufferings, by a protracted search after balls, but will be ready to adopt the sentiments of Botallus, who, after detailing a case in which a ball entered a little above the right groin, and remained in the abdomen during life, lays down the following excellent practical rule for our conduct in searching after balls ; Si in- vtneris educas, quod si non s ini to. In treating of wounds of the abdominal parietes, I avail my- self of this opportunity of noticing wounds of the Diaphragm. From the peculiar situation of this muscular partition, it can- not be wounded, without the wounding body passing through one or other of the two cavities of which the diaphragm forms the common boundary ; and when we consider the vital import- ance of the organs contiguous to the diaphragm, both above and below, the heart and lungs on the thoracic, with the liver and stomach on the abdominal side ; and when wounds of one or all of these organs are superadded to the injury of the diaphragm itself, it is matter of surprise that a recovery should ever take place. Of this, however, we have more than one instance upon record ; amongst others, an instructive case is to be found in the eighth volume of the Edinburgh Medical

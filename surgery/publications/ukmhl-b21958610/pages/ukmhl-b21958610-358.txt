Baron Percy, in estimating the fatality of wounds of the stomach, calculates, that four or five out of twenty have escaped, a proportion of success with which the Baron has certainly abundant reason to be satisfied; And which the success of others will hardly warrant us to ex- pect. Wounds of the stomach are detected by the clirection of the wounding body; by the depth to which it has pene- trated ; by the occurrence of nausea, retching, and bloody vomiting ; and not unfrequently by the discharge of food or drink through the wound. When the wound is of a limited extent, no attempt to close it mechanically is admissible, but when an extensive opening is made with a clean cutting in- strument, the facts upon record seem to justify, and to demand the mechanical closure of the wound, by means of the gloverâ€™s suture, or the suture recommended by Lcmbert, which I shall hereafter have occasion to describe. In addition to this, we have recourse to blood-letting, general or topical, as circumstances may demand ; to laxative and nutritious clysters; the most mild unirritating food in small quan- tity ; and avoiding, of course, the introduction into the stomach of those nauseating and purgative medicines, from which we derive essential aid in other cases of inflammation. Under such treatment, wounds of the stomach, if not imme- diately fatal, are, in a few cases, speedily healed, in others they degenerate into fistulous openings, continuing sometimes for jnany years. Before considering the treatment of Wounded Intestines, it is necessary to point out the propriety of immediately reducing pny portion of the gut which may be protruded without being wounded. Even when this may have prolapsed for some time, and may in consequence be much inflamed, the re- <

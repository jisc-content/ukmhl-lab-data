INFLAMMATION. 125 of a vital process, so desirable in itself, may be best promot- ed and secured; and, at present, I would refer those who :are desirous of studying the phenomena attendant upon the iprocess of adhesion, to an “ Essay on the Formation of New i Blood-Vessels,” lately presented to the Royal College of Sur- geons here, by Dr. Allan Thomson. When wounds do not unite by adhesion, their surface be- comes covered with purulent matter, which appears to be a secretion produced by a peculiar action of the vessels of the part; and this constitutes Suppuration,—a process which also iften takes place in different textures of the body, without the existence of a wound ; and when thus included in a shut sac, forms iv hat is termed an abscess. This is, perhaps, one of •he most common of all the results of inflammation.' We oee pus formed occasionally in all the great cavities of the oody, and we see it often, in consequence of chemical or me- chanical irritations, formed on the surface of those membranes .ining different canals, which in the sound state are covered vitli a secretion of mucus. Ulceration is that process by which ulcers are formed, by vhich abscesses are sometimes opened without the assistance if art, and by which the soft parts are removed so as to make vay for the passage of extraneous matters to the surface of th e iody.. This process is also a common result of inflammation, md is essentially performed by the absorbent vessels, which gradually remove a portion of the once living solid. While the last-mentioned process is productive of solutions >f continuity, and sometimes occasions extensive destruction >f parts, we must look to the process of Granulation for the ■estoration of such parts. The first step in this process, wliic h s obvious to our senses, is the effusion of a layer of coagulabl e ympli, at first exhibiting a smooth surface, but subsequently lecoming elevated into small red papillary eminences, known >y the name of granulations; and when these have risen to

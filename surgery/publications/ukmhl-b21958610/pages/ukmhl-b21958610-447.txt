OPHTHALMIA. 427 The term ophthalmia is employed by medical writers to de- note inflammation of the eye, originating from whatever cause, while it may be observed, that amongst non-profes- sional people, the word ophthalmia is thought to imply a dis- ease of a very peculiar and specific nature. The term Egyp- tian ophthalmia has been still more circumscribed in its ap- plication, and has been thought to imply a disease suigeneris, different from every other inflammation of the eye. This is an application of the tenn little calculated to impress us with correct opinions of its nature or treatment; and medical men have ceased to consider the Egyptian ophthalmia as possessing any thing peculiar in its nature, or demanding any specific mode of treatment, the only difference recognised being its ex- treme violence and difficulty of cure. The disease has, perhaps, in all ages been familiar to the inhabitants of warm countries, while the happy exemption of the northern parts of Europe from the more aggravated forms of ophthalmia, rendered us till of late little conscious of their existence. Although ever since the return of the troops from Egypt in 1801 and 1802, the disease occasionally prevailed to a limited extent, chiefly in those regiments which had served there, it was not until 1805 that it appeared in such a form as to give general alarm, and this not in an old corps which had served abroad, but in the second battalion of the 52d regiment, a battalion recently embodied, and at that time quartered in the barracks at Hythe in Kent. The leading circumstances attending the propagation of the disease in this regiment, as given by Dr. Vetch, are interesting, not only from their individual im- portance, but as affording grounds for more general deduc- tions. This battalion was formed at Banbury in Oxford- shire, by a draft of a few officers and privates from the first battalion in the end of 1804, and soon afterwards marched to the barracks in Hythe, where, on the 9th of June 1805, it was joined by about five hundred volunteers from the Irish mi-

AMPUTATION. 4]y a posterior flap from the extensor and supinator muscles, its point slipped between the bones, which rendered it necessary to withdraw it and to pass it more carefully behind the ulna. This was perhaps owing partly to my own inadvertence to the exact position of the bones, but in part also, I believe, to the connexion between the lower extremities of the radius and ulna having been broken up, so that in pressing the knife close to the back of the radius, with the view of obtaining a suffi- ciency of muscular substance to form a good flap, the parallel- ism of the two bones was in some measure destroyed, the ra- dius was pressed forwards, and the interosseous space thus pre- sented to the point of the knife.11 Amputation in the region of the humerus is an operation upon which many valuable remarks are to be found in the writings of Mr. Guthrie and other military surgeons ; it is one of those cases in which, generally speaking, the mode of ope- rating, whether by the circular incision or double flap, is very much a matter of choice. For a number of years past I have been in the habit of performing and seeing my colleagues per- form this operation almost exclusively by flaps, and the gene- ral result of these cases does not suggest any objection to this mode of operating ; but I may remark, than when this am- putation is made at or near to the insertion of the deltoid mus- cle, and the flaps formed by passing the catline perpendicu- larly through the arm, the hone is left very scantily covered in one direction, and in such a case I have once seen it with great difficulty prevented from protruding between the flaps. In all the amputations hitherto noticed, the surgeon may have recourse to a tourniquet for the purpose of suppress- ing the haemorrhage during the operation ; and it may be ob- served, that it is in amputations of the inferior part of the limb, chiefly in the fore-arm and leg, that the tourniquet becomes most useful. In the superior parts of the limbs, when the whole of the blood is concentrated in one channel, and when 2 E

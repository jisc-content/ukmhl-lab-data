WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. 339 duction is to be immediately effected. The greater difficulty there may be in accomplishing this, the more obvious its necessity becomes ; for it will readily he perceived, that the in- flammation is likely to be greatly aggravated by that degree of stricture which prevents the return of the intestine. It has been proposed to make numerous small punctures with a needle in the protruded gut, for the purpose of permitting the contained air to escape, and thereby diminish its bulk, and facili- tate its reduction. The slightest experience, however, of this expedient will demonstrate its futility, to say nothing of its danger; it will be found perfectly insufficient to attain the object in view, and although sanctioned by the names of Chopart and Desault, I am compelled to state from personal observation, that the apertures, even if much larger than those of a needle, are speedily closed by the protrusion of the mucous coat; if again these apertures are extended to a size sufficient to ensure the escape of the contained air, they will be so many distinct wounds in the intestine, each of them in- finitely more dangerous than a prolongation of the external wound, which is the most eligible way of returning the pro- truding bowel. Wounds of the small intestines are, for the most part, either primarily or secondarily fatal, while those of the large intes- tines sometimes heal without difficulty. This fact has not escaped the notice of the ancients, for they pronounced wounds of the latter dangerous in the highest degree; those of the former, without exception, fatal. The symptoms indicating wounds of the intestinal tube, are a small and tremulous pulse, paleness of the countenance; great prostration of strength, and tendency to syncope ; the discharge of blood ^ith the stools; and the escape of foetid air or of faecal mat- ters from the wound, which unequivocally show the nature of the injury. But however urgent these symptoms may be, the wounded bowel be not protruded, we must rest satis-

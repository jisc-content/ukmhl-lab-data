HOSPITALS. 85 “ Independent of all temptations to abuse, which it is to be iihoped most of us could resist, this plan is in some cases ab- solutely incompatible with the proper dieting of the sick.

That case I have noticed in the following words.—“ The present allowances are well known to be in general adequate to all the purposes required of them, but instances are not wanting where the surgeon has been for months together considerably out of pocket by a large demand for wine ; indeed, I know a case at this moment quite in point, it is that of an assistant-surgeon, left by the death of his sur- geon in charge of a sickly regiment requiring a large supply of wine.

This young man must either procure wine from his private funds and involve himself in debt, or

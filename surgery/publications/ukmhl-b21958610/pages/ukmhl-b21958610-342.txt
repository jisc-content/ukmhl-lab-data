MILITARY SURGERY. 322 or punctures through the skin. In some cases, it is difficult to determine whether the lungs, from being superficially wounded, do not furnish a part of the air, and hence the pro- priety of closing the external orifice has been questioned. This point may, however, in general, be speedily determined, for if, upon the external wound being closed, emphysema ex- tends into the cellular membrane, while at the same time the difficulty of breathing continues progressively to increase, it is then almost certain that the air is escaping from a wounded lung ; and the rational practice is to remove the dressing, and permit the direct ingress and egress of the air through the wound, until time has been afforded for the wounded air-cells to be closed by the effusion of coagulating lymph, and the supervention of the adhesive inflammation ; an event which will, under favourable circumstances, generally be effected in forty-eight hours. Whenever the closure of the breach in the lung is fairly accomplished, the case then becomes similar to the one already described where the air is wholly admitted by the external wound. If from the oblique or indirect course of a wound through the parictes of the chest, air does not readily escape, but continues to accumulate within the pleura, so as to endanger suffocation, the opening must either be ren- dered more direct, or a new one formed. The practice recom- mended by theoretical writers, of employing exhausting sy- ringes for the removal of air extravasated within the thorax, is now considered superfluous by all practical men, and the possibility of immediately and suddenly expanding a collapsed lung by such contrivances, is disbelieved by the ablest sur- geons. In cases of fractured ribs, instances both of emphysema and of pneumothorax occasionally arise from the lung being wounded by spiculae of bone, and in such cases, a bandage is applied round the thorax, with a view of restraining as much as possible the action of the ribs, and preventing the extension.

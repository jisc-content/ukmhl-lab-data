We often find them quite irregu- lar in shape, sometimes approaching more or less to an oblong form, and in other cases almost circular. Their edges are sometimes ragged, often elevated with more or less hardness of the surrounding teguments, and occasionally inverted. It has been long since observed, that the circular form of ulcers was one unfavourable to their cicatrization ; and in as far as cicatriza- tion is promoted by the mutual approximation of the edges of the ulcer, it will readily be seen, that the means now chiefly used in this country to approximate the edges of wounds and ulcers, adhesive straps and bandages, cannot act so favourably on sores of a circular, as on those of an oblong form. In the progress of ulcers, some textures, as that of the skin and cel- lular substance, moulder away and disappear, as it were, en- tirely under the process, while it is to be observed, that parts of a firmer texture, such as aponeuroses, tendons, cartilages, and bones, do not follow this law, but, in the first instance, become mortified and separate in considerable masses, being isolated by the destruction of the contiguous parts which serve for their nutrition. Besides the division of ulcers formerly noticed, into Local and Constitutional, or Specific, other subdivisions calculat- ed to suggest the most appropriate applications have been adopted. Of these, one of the most useful is that of the late Sir Everard Home, who considers the impediments to the cure of ulcers as occurring from a defect or excess of action, which defect or excess may arise either from a general fault in the constitution, or in the part in which the ulcer is seated. And in the treatment of a simple ulcer, when the healing pro- cess goes on in a kindly manner, it will readily be understood, that beyond the necessary attention to cleanliness, and the re- moval of a superabundance of purulent matter, the surgeon

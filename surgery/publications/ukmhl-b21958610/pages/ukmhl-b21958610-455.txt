435 OPHTHALMIA. by frequency, inveteracy, or neglect, acquires the power of self-propagation, is consistent with what has been observed in the history of some other diseases. Whoever reads the various accounts given of the disease termed Egyptian ophthalmia, particularly those of Dr. Vetch and of the late Sir Patrick M‘Gregor, contained in the third volume of the “ Transac- tions of a society for the improvement of Medical and Sur- gical Knowledge,'” will, I think, admit that the disease is communicable from one person to another only by the appli- cation of the infectious matter to the eyes. The opinion that the disease is ever communicated from one person to another through the medium of the atmosphere, is at present nearly abandoned, although Sir William Adams maintained, that he had seen many cases which prove that the disorder may spread like small-pox, without inoculation. Dr. Vetch has well observed, that, from whatever cause inflammation of the conjunctiva may originate, when the action is of that nature or degree of violence as to produce a purulent or pu- riform discharge, the discharge so produced operates as an animal virus when applied to the conjunctiva of a heal- thy eye. And, considering the various modes by which such contact may occur, it is obvious that wherever ophthal- mia prevails, wdiether it be the effect of local conditions of the soil or of the atmosphere, “ this contagious effect must sooner or later mix, and unite its operation with that of the more general and original cause.” Upon the venereal diseases of the eye, so well described in the writings of Lawrence and Hewson, it is not my pre- sent purpose to enlarge, but there is one peculiar source of purulent ophthalmia, which it may be necessary here to no- tice ; I mean that arising from the application of gonorrhoeal matter to the eyes, or, as stated by some, from the suppres- sion of the gonorrhoeal discharge. Although I can scarcely say that I have myself witnessed an unequivocal instance of

MILITARY SURGERY. 104 posed were frequently considerably swollen, as if inflated, bulging out in the centre of the diseased mass. The ankle and back part of the leg were the parts most frequently af- fected ; and in two or three instances the ulcer involved great part of the Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles, completely de- stroying the Tendo Achillis. When the slough began to separate, the tendons were frequently found hanging in clus- ters from the half-destroyed muscles. No texture escaped its destructive influence; skin and cellular substance evidently suffered most rapidly ; muscles next; then tendon, and lastly bone, which sloughed off in pieces, during the progress of healing. The arteries or nerves were rarely affected. The separation of the viscid slough ; absence of the very offensive and very peculiar smell; a circle of healthy inflammation round the sore ; increase of pain, and improvement of the general health, indicated a favourable termination. The edges generally became clean first; and frequently in an extensive ulcer, one half would be throwing out granulations, and cica- trizing rapidly, while the other was still under the sloughing process. In the long continued cases, hectic fever was observed ; diarrhoea was a frequent occurrence.” “In few cases, when severe, did either form terminate without loss of life or limb, or the destruction of such a con- siderable portion of muscle, as to render the patient unfit for further effective service. Amputation was performed in three —in two of them however, at such a late period of the dis- ease, as not to succeed in saving the lives of the patients. Five in all died, including one, who expired the day after his arrival from Pinang.” “ The disease was evidently epidemic, depending either upon some peculiar state of the atmosphere; or upon some cause acting generally upon the whole body of troops. It seemed to attack the young and the old, the robust and the

388 MILITARY SURGERY. to the first allegation, it may be observed, that the lever may be extended ad libitum by lengthening the cords, and as to the other, it is to be recollected, that those muscles which pass over two contiguous joints are mostly tendinous at their insertions, and although spasm might be excited by com- pressing the fleshy bellies of these muscles, the same thing will not happen from compressing their tendinous extremities. As to the direction in which the extension is to be made, the only rule which admits of general application is to extend the limb in the direction in which the dislocated bone stands, but where this is not immediately successful, the surgeon naturally tries those other positions which his knowledge of the struc- ture of the joint and the laws of mechanism suggest. I have already observed, that it is chiefly the powerful re- sistance of the muscles which surround a joint that we have to overcome in the reduction of luxation ; and hence much may he gained by putting the limb in such • a position as to relax those muscles from which we chiefly expect resist- ance. It is found also that muscles may he fatigued or worn out, and in some measure paralysed, by long continued extension ; hence, the advantage of pulling, in a gradual and regular manner, instead of attempting to effect the extension by a short, interrupted, or jerking motion. The only instance in which a sudden manoeuvre of this latter kind succeeds, is, when by drawing the patient’s attention to some other subject, the opposing muscles arc, as it were, taken by surprise, and the reduction effected before they are prepared for resist- ance. This power of resistance in the muscles, it is well known, is greatly lessened, indeed almost annihilated in a state of faintness or syncope, and hence, a practice at once rational, judicious, and successful, has been institut- ed with a view of artificially producing this state. For this purpose, the employment of general blood-letting, of the warm-bath, and of nauseating doses of antimonials are in ge-

113 INFLAMMATION. I think, upon all those who had occasion to witness it; I al- lude to that ol‘ a seaman belonging to one of his Majesty’s ships, in the roads, whose limb had been amputated below the knee in consequence of an accident. The accommodation on board his ship was defective, and the vessel being about to sail, he was brought ashore to this hospital and placed under my care; here his stump sloughed, the symptomatic fever ran high, was attended with that dingy yellowness of the skin to which I allude, and in a few days he died. “ I observed to the surgeon of the ship, who came ashore to see him dissected, that this case wanted nothing but the black vomit to constitute a complete example of yellow fever ; and it was found, on laying open the stomach, that this circumstance, necessary to complete the parallel, was hardly wanting ; for here was a large collection of that dark grumous fluid resembling coffee grounds, which is so often evacuated from the stomach in tropical fevers.” There is one circumstance which perhaps more than any other has been held to be a criterion of the existence of inflammation, particularly when the inflamed part being situated internally, the disease is not to be detected by any of the local symptoms conspicuous to our senses, namely, that particular appearance exhibited by the blood drawn from patients labouring under acute inflammation, and which has been termed the huffy coat or inflammatory crust. The appearance of the huffy coat is dependant up- on the slower coagulation of inflammatory blood, in conse- quence of which the red particles fall to the bottom of the vessel, leaving a portion of the surface of the crussamcn- tum destitute of colouring particles. With reference to the presence of the fibrinous coat, we must particularly advert to the quick or slow stream in which the blood has flowed, in active inflammation of the fibrous texture the forma- tion of the huffy coat cannot be prevented, because the fib- i

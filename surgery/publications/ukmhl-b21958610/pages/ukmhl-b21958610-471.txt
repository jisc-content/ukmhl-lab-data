451 OPHTHALMIA. to remove. When seated opposite the pupil, vision is nearly destroyed ; but this affection is for the most part less exten- sive than nebula, and the remedies recommended for nebula are similar to those which have been found useful in albugo. Leucoma, the third species of opacity, is that arising from the healing of an ulcer ; and although it is superficial, and less dense than the last-described species, yet it is less influenced by medicines. The drops already recommended, and the sti- mulating ointments, are in some instances found to produce a good effect. In addition to local remedies, the use of mer- cury, in the shape of calomel or blue pill, is often beneficial in opacities of the cornea, by stimulating the absorbent system to a more lively action. Upon the very unsatisfactory and contradictory causes which have been assigned for the occurrence of Inflammation of the ins, it does not appear to me that I can enlarge in such a manner as to give more clear conceptions of its treatment. Suffice it then to observe, that in many cases of long con- tinued ocular inflammation, an increasing but regular con- traction of the pupil, and diminished mobility of the iris, be- gin to shew that the inflammation has extended to this part also. The pupil for some time preserves its circular shape, the smaller ring or pupillary margin of the iris becomes of a light reddish colour, while its exterior margin, or larger ring, assumes a greenish hue. The inflammation continuing to increase, the iris now swells, pushes forwards, and presents a convex surface towards the cornea. This is followed by the effusion of coagulating lymph from the posterior surface of the iris, which forms a connexion between it and the capsule of the lens, this adhesion rendering the iris immoveable at particular points. The shape of the pupil becomes irregular, and if the disease is still suffered to proceed, small pustules of a dark orange colour sometimes appear on the surface of the

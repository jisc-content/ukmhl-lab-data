SUnaiCAL ANATOMY OF THE BLADDER, PEOSTATE GLAND, ETC. 615 the under surface of the corpora cavernosa, at their junction in the middle line; but at their anterior truncated end, the spongj body- enlarges over them and forms the glans penis. Around the vertical orifice of the urethra, the erectile structure forms two small lips, which when turgid with blood—as from congestion of the mucous membrane —constrict the urethral orifice to a smaller size than even in its usual state. The muscles of the urethra and penis are—the accelerator urinaa- Fig. 855.* — or ejaculator seminis, the comj)ressor urethras, already noticed, and the erector penis. The accelerator urince has an important relation to the urethra. This muscle is a flat expansion of muscular fibres, under and around the urethra, or corpus spongiosum, and extending from the bulb to the junction of the corpora cavernosa, at the converging crura. (Fig. 855.) The muscle arises from the central tendinous point of the peritoneum, * Superficial view of the Perineum, in Male.-l. Superficial perineal nerve. ^ buperficial perineal artery. 3.

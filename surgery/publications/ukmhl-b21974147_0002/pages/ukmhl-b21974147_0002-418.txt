Displacement will depend the line of fracture, and on whether the force pro- ducing it be direct or indirect. Thus, fracture of the body of a vertebra, and by indirect violence, as a fall on the head from a height, will occasion great displacement; the upper portion of the body being driven downwards and forwards, and the lower backwards and up- wards, with excurvation of the spine posteriorly, so that the projecting point corresponds to the spinous process of the fractured vertebra. In proportion as the frae- Fig. 725.1 -^^ transverse, and the displacement a slid- ing forwards only, the spinous process of the broken vertebra is de- pressed and disappears, while the process of the vertebra below thus re- latively projects. (Fig. 724.) Direct violence of an extreme kind will also produce displace- ment ; as a gunshot in- jury to tbe spine. Com- minution is mostly pro- duced by violent flexion forwards, as Malgaigne alleged ; but it may also arise from direct violence, appUedin the opposite direction, as by a fall * Univ. Coll.

Fracture through the anterior part of the body of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, with displacement of the eleventh forwards, carrying with it the detaclied fragment of the twelfth. The anterior common lica- ment is untorn. The spinal cord was compressed just above the cauda equina. Reparative deposit of new bone on the vertebral arch, opposite the seat of fracture. _ X Univ.

He was insensible, and died shortly after admission into the Hospital. ยง Ibid., 162. Fracture through the "body of the ninth dorsal vertebra, with displacement of the upper portion forwards upon the lower to such an extent, that the dura mater and spinal cord are completely divided; but the anterior com- mon ligament is entire, although stripped from the front of the vertebra below. The spinous process of the eighth vertebra has also been detached. The pleura was lacerated at the seat of injury.

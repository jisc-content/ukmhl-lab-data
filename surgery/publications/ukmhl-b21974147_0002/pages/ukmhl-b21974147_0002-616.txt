They con- sist chiefly m a light nonnshing diet and a tonic course of treatment; with regulation of the bowels and solution of the feeces by castor oil and other mild aperients, and opiates administered internally, and per J Injection or suppository, to assuage pain. Chloroform applied locally to the anus by means of a piece of lint covered with oil-silk, or inhaled as usual has given marked ease, although not pushed to the extent of msensibihty; and its anesthetic influence may be resorted to daily, it necessary. The introduction of any instruments is always hazardous. Bouc^ies and tents must not be thought of. Feculent accumulations above the stricture may sometimes be reduced by passing a long tube throuo-h the stricture, and then giving an injection of warm wa,ter. But this proceeding must be conducted with the utmost caution. Excision of the cancerous mass was proposed and practised by Lisfranc ; and afterwards by Dieffenbach, with success in no less, it is said, than thirty patients, not one of whom died in consequence of the operation. Nevertheless, that such a procedure is justifiable may well be doubted. Colotomy, in the left loin, seems a far more surgical resource, both as a means of relieving misery connected with the rectum and of prolonging life. This operation was originally advocated by Mr. Curling, on the physiological principle that by discharging the ±£eces, without allowing any passage through the rectal stricture, the part aftected will thus be set at rest. He administers an injection to somewhat distend the colon, in order to secure it more readily when reached by the lumbar incision. The results of operation have been encouraging,—both for the relief of the excruciating pain during evacuation and the other rectal symptoms, and in the duration of life.

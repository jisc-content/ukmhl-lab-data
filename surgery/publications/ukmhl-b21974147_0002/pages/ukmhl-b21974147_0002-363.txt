In the worst cases there is scarcely any attempt at the formation of the ^'^tSrSo be borne in mind that the vomer covered by the nasal mucous membrane is often attached to one edge of the palate usually the right, as this condition when present forms an element of difficulty in the performance of the operation of splitting the palate, recently sug- gested and successfully performed by the late Sir William Jergusson ^ Aqe for Operation.-Wit}i the aid of chloroform and one of the many newly improved gags, the operation for closure of a deft m the palate, involving either the soft parts only or both the hard and soft, may be performed at a much earlier period of hfe than formerly. Before the introduction of anaesthetics, the greatest courage and self- control on the part of the patient were necessary, m order to enable the Surgeon to perform this most difficult of surgical operations. Within the last few years, successful results have been obtained m children as young as three years (BiUroth succeeded m one instance, the child being under twelve months, without chloroform), but it is not generally advisable to operate earlier than this; at the same time, there is no doubt that the earlier the operation be performed the less will be the impediment in the patient's speech. Space does not allow of our entering into a detailed description of the various gags now in use. Suffice it to say that the simplest and most efficacious is an instrument (Fig. 696) a modification by Mr. Rose of the unilateral gag (Fig. 697) used by the late Sir W. Fergusson.

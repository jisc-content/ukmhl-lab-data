OPERATION FOR CLEFT PALATE. ^'^f upwards to tTae apex of the cleft. Repeating this on tlae other side, a :Jntinuouspece nja^^^^^^^ ...p Fia.699. Fig. 702. tocrether, may now be effected. Wire, horsehair, and silk sutures have all been used with success, and have each their advocates; but fine silk thread, _ wPll waxed is, on the whole, easiest of manipulation Tir'ntroduction of the' sutures is best accomphshed by the man- of+v^hn+pd to Mr Avorv A curved needle set m a handle, with aTe;? elo^h^^^^^^^^^ Fig. 698), and armed with a waxed thread of ordinary sized suture-silk, is passed from below upwards nWt a Quarter of an inch from the cut margin of the fissure; the ttead is seizeTwith forceps close to the eye of the needle, and drawn ala doub e thread out of the mouth, with the single ends also hang- ing out wben the needle is withdrawn, leaving the thread double thfough that edge of the palate. A similar double thread is then passed from below upwards, through the other margin, at the same distance from the cut surface and Exactly opposite the first thread. Thus, there is now a double thread through Fig. 701. each side of the fissure. (Fig. 700.) The left-hand loop. A, is next passed through the right, B, and on pulling the ends of the right thread, C C, the left is drawn through the right side. By holding one end and pulling on the loop, A the thread will become single, and the ends may remain hanging out, one at either corner of the mouth ready, when the other stitches are passed, to be drawn tight and made fast. Two, three, or four threads are in- troduced in like manner, and then each is tied n Â« securely, first with a slip knot (Fig. 701), and then with a double reef. Care should be taken not to draw the threads too tight, lest the circulation in the edges of the flaps be interfered with * After Mason. < 1 VOL. II.

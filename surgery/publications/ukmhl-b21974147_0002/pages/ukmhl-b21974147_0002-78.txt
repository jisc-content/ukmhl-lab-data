SPECIAL PATIIOLOOY AND SURGERY. 50 i'rom tlie puncture for a week or ten days; unless pain and swcUinj? should indicate the probable supervention of some suppuration. On removing the compress, the puncture may be quite closed, and ilry, with a little circle of redness around. And this primary union may bo permanent, as in my first case of infra-trochanteric section, in a boy six years old. In the second case, a scrofulous boy, a^ed fourteen, some oozing ensued. Therefore, in any case, howeveMavourable its progress, the compress should be reapplied, and continued, as a safe- guard, during the course of reparation. Osseous union takes place in six weeks or two months according to the age of the patient; and the formation of an intermediate caUas is unaccompanied by any notable inflammatory symptoms. In the event of discharge from the puncture-wound, the compress must be removed, in order to give free vent to the serous or purulent fluid ; and the case is then to be treated as one of compound fracture without however being complicated by comminution of the bone, or laxseration of the surrounding muscles. - , , ■ Dr John Ashhurst, of Philadelphia, has performed subcutaneous section of the femur on hotli hips, in the same patient; on the left side, "Adams's operation"—through the neck, and on the right sidc^ Gant s operation "—iust below the trochanters. In this case a child, nine years old, had anchylosis of both hip-joints, consequent on 'strumous disease;" in the right hip, the neck of the femur seemed to have entirely disappeared, and hence the preference, or rather the possibihty only, of my operation. The result, at the date of communication to Mr Adams, was satisfactory; the limbs being parallel, and of nearly the same length. (See Lartcef, Nov. 25th, 1876.) .-it ^ In the most recent case, with the particulars of whidi I am acquainted, I witnessed the operation as performed at St. ihomas s Hospital by Mr. Croft; the puncture-wound having been made, and the bone sawn partly through, under the influence of the antiseptic spray, at the "posterior fifth of the shaft, the bone was broken by a movement of extension and rotation inwards The limb was easily placed in a satisfactory position. A httle blood oozed from tbe wound for a few seconds after the operation, the sawing having occupied four minutes. As soon as the oozing appeared to have ceased, the wound was covered by a compress of lint saturated with oil and carbolic acid (one to twenty), and a layer of antiseptic ^^^''^r%l^''^^tTo.t bracketed long outside splint was then applied. Thus, m tbis case, the operation was departed from in certain particulars, y^iich I deem essential to success. The bone was partly /mciW, and perhaps^ therefore, splintered; and air was allowed to enter through tie puncturelwound, after dividing the bone. The procedure was sub- cutaneous, from first to last, ""^er command of the ^^^^ compress.

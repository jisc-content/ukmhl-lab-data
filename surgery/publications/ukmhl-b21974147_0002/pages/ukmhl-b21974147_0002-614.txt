The greater liability of females to this disease accords also with the experience of Mr. Copeland and of Ur. ±5ushe. An external injury to the part has occasionaUy been the cause, as a severe kick in the fundament: 2Vea^meri^.-The principle of treatment is mechanical dilatation of the stricture. Considerable judgment will be requisite in carrying out this treatment. Besides attention to the natural course and character of the canal and the nature of the stricture, two additional rules should always be observed in using dilatation,-namely, never to make any iorcible effort, and never to cause pain, nor the risk of haemorrha-e which might be perilous. The instrument used should always pass ^stor oU ■ ""^^ ^^^^ ""'^'^ aperients, especially When situated low down, dilatation can be effected with tolerable tacility, by the introduction of a proper-sized gum-elastic boucrie or compressed sponge-tent. Either form of dilator must be allowed to remain m the stricture ; the bougie for ten or fifteen minutes, the tent may remain for twelve or twenty-four hours. Dilatation must be renewed every two or three days, and with instruments of progres- sively increasing size. Tent-dilatation is, however, the most effectual, owing to the swelling character of the compressed sponge. A very tight annular or almost membranous stricture may be advantageously notched with a protected bistoury,—my "concealed fistula°knife " being serviceable for this purpose. The posterior aspect of the canal IS the safest for a slight incision, not to endanger the peritoneum. JUiIatation can then be accomplished by widening the seat of contrac- tion with the forefinger of each hand, introduced into the bowel; and maintained by a bougie or tent. Various other dilating instruments have been devised, by Weiss, Bushe, Arnott, Sir C. Bell, Charriere of Fans, Nelaton, Bermond, Todd, Costallat, and Coxeter; all of them are ingenious, yet not so efficient as the bougie. If the stricture be situated high up, the same treatment may be adopted, but with very great caution. A wax or a very flexible gum- elastic bougie should be used. Pain or spasm following the use of instruments admit of relief by the occasional introduction of opiate

Limited tumours, more or less pedunculated, may spring up between carious teeth occupying the cavities of decay or Lj thrust themselves up between the stumps of a decayed tooth. Such " polypi " of the gums generally sprmg from the Jlveolo-dentar periosteum, close to the edge o a socket, and differ hardly at all from normal gum m histological chaa-acter. ihe • extraction o^f the tooth involved will often be desirable, and the polypus may come with it; if the extraction of the tooth is on ^^y/^^^O'^^^/T'; ad^sable, the growth may be cut away and the stump destroyed by escharotics, but it generally recurs. i • ^ x-u. ,,-nrl Ko hard and fast line can be drawn between polypi of the gum and ejndis, the name usually apphed to non-mahgnant broad-based growths of the -urn. Like polypi, they spring from the periosteum, and recui unless this also is removed; so that, for the cure of epulis, a portion of the alveolar border of the bone is generally removed with cutting toi - ceps. The use of the dental drdling engine, carrying very smali circular saws, renders it easy to remove portions of the alveolar borders and of the periosteum, without sacrificmg the teeth; by its help an epulis can oftentimes be efficiently extirpated with no further injury to the teeth than the removal of a portion of their sockets, which is practically found not to interfere with their fixation._ Sometimes epulis seems distinctly to be caused by the irritation of diseased teeth; sometimes its origin is as clearly independent of any such influence. General hypertrophy affecting the whole gums and alveolar border is a comparatively rare disease. It is a pure hypertrophy, commencing generally early in life, the teeth sometimes participating in the exces- sive development, and sometimes being of normal size. It may pro- duce great deformity, as in the case of Julia Pastrana, the Pig-i^ced woman, a model of whose mouth is here figured. (Figs. 691, 692 ) When the orowth is of such size as to call for interference, it may bo removed by operation, the masses being pared away with a scalpel, or, if necessary, with bone-forceps. ,i ■■• In a case (f. sat. 15) which came under my own notice, the disease

Fihrous Stricture.—TUs condition of stricture presents a prominent ring within the cavity of the rectum, entirely or partially sur- rounding the cavity of the bowel. It consists apparently of a fold of thickened mucous mem- brane, but principally of fibrous condensation o± the submucous cellular tissue ; occasionally there is coexisting liypertrophy of the muscular coat; rarely any change in the peritoneal in- vestment, which generally retains its healthy structure. The structural alteration is some- times limited m extent, presenting an annular stricture (Fig. 844); more often, the induration extends from half an inch to two or more in length, reaching perhaps to three or four inches, or even nearly the entire length of the rectum. If the thickening is greater on one side of the bowel than the other, the passacre assumes an irregular winding shape. In rare cases, the contraction of the canal seems due to muscular action, no structural change having been discovered in the coats of the rectum; and also rarely, it is owing to the formation of thP wnll nf fl.. , ^hvons bands across the cavity of the bowel, conditions of remaimng unaffected.

658 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SUKGERY. The numher of calculi varies chiefly according to the seat of the stone. In the bladder, usually there is only one ; in the kidney, two or more; and in the prostate, several. Vesical calculi are, however, sometimes numerous; two to six or eight are not very uncommon, and instances are on record of 117; 142 about the size of marbles, were removed by Sir A. Cooper; 307, 678, and even 1000 have been found—the latter number having been extracted by Dr. Physick from an American judge. This number is the largest on record; the stones varied in size from partridge-shot to a bean. _ ^.^ , Chemical Composition.—In regard to their essential constituents urinary calculi, like deposits, may be divided into two classes ; a third class represents the more rare forms. (1.). Calculi consistmg of uric acid and the urate of ammonia; with their varieties the oxalate ot lime, uric or xanthic oxide, and cystic oxide or cystme. (2.) Phosphatic calculi, in all their varieties; as phosphate of ammonia and magnesia phosphate of lime, and mixed phosphates of lime magnesia, and Lmonia,-constituting the fusible calculus (3.) The hbrmous uro- stealith, carbonate of lime, and silicious calculi. Urinary calculi may be severally dishnguisUd both by their physical characters, and by chemical tests; sometimes also by the crystalline forms of their constituents, as shown by microscopical ^^"'pWcaTproperties are most readily recognized, but they are least definite and distinctive; Calculi wUl, therefore, be described m the order of their chemical relationship, with regard to lests II ) Uric, or LUldc Acid Calculus.-The most common of all calculi is that consist ng of lithic acid. It was discovered by Scheele m 17/6. Its colour is generally light brown, varying however from pale brown to dark broln; and sometimes whitish on the surface, owmg to its having become'coated with amorphous urate of -rnrnon.. ov ^^^ Phosphate of lime. The shape is usually ovoid, and somewhat flattened ?he surface smooth, or beset with small tubercles, so as to resemb^ the si^face of oxalkte of lime calculus; the size varies from that of a pea to an orange, and its consistence is hard according to the ^uSy of the calcufus; sometimes emitting a ringing ^^^-^^^^^^on Ln and breaking up into sharp angular fragments. Ihe calculus on section is found to be composed of concentric lamina and exhibi s Hnes or fibres radiating from the centre to the circumference of tl e stone both these appearances are marked in proportion to the punt^ of the calculus and determine the lines of fracture when the stone is brotn The nucleus may be quito white, although consisting of pure DroKen. -lub iiul. c j i shown, to the absence ot ^iZL7:t^y heat; turned red byniWc acid, for,nmg a murex>de; Rolnble in carbonate of potash, evolving no ammonia.

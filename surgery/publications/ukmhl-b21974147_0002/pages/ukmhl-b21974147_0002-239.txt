DISEASES OF THE IRIS. 211 The treatment may be that of removal; by an incision throug'h the cornea, withdrawing the cyst and cutting it off. Or—as Mr. Walton recommends—punctaring the cyst with an iris-knife allows it to collapse. This operation may have to be repeated. (3.) Mtosis and Mydriasis signify, respectively, a persistent con- traction or dilatation of the pupil; unconnected with any apparent structural disease of the part, and arising from purely functional causes. Gontradion sometimes takes place in persons accustomed to examine minute objects; and, the iids refusing to dilate, this state is accompanied with impairment of vision, especially in a feeble light. Rest of the over-used organ is the obvious indication of treatment. Dilatation may result from the application of belladonna to the eye, or the long-continued influence of other narcotics. It may be caused also by pressure affecting the brain, as in apoplexy and com- pression; and it is frequently symptomatic of confirmed amaurosis. It is said to depend, occasionally, on some eccentric source of irritation, as gastric irritation. Lastly, it may be symptomatic of an affection of the nerves supplying the iris, without any loss of sensibility of the retina; and this form is perhaps accompanied by ptosis and external squint, as a further symptom of paralysis of the third or motor-oculi nerve. A tonic plan of treatment wiU generally be appropriate. Mr. Taylor recommends nux vomica; and derivation by means of a succession of bHsters to the temple has proved beneficial, with the application of stimulating vapour, as of ammonia, to the eye. Improvement of vision —the retina retaining its sensibility—may be aided by habitually using appropriate concave or convex glasses. (4.) Artificial Vvvil—Operations for the admission of light throuo-h the u'ls are of thi-ee kinds, all of which are comprised under the term formation of an artificial pupil. (1) The formation of a new aperture in the iris, when the portion forming the natural pupil has prolapsed through a breach m the cornea; (2) the reopening or the enlargement ' foy I P^Pi^' ^lien obstructed by inflammatory deposit; and I (d) the displacement towards a transparent part of the cornea of a 1 pupil which has become concealed behind a dense corneal opacity. The following conditions are laid down by Mr. Dixon as essentially : necessary to be observed, before having recourse to any kind of opera- ; tion for artificial ^u^il-.—Firstly, whether the eye perceives light- mere obliteration of a pupil will not deprive the eye of this power' I provided the retina be sound. Secondly, the presence or absence of the lens must, as far as possible, be ascertained; and, if present . whether it is transparent or opaque. Thirdly, the cornea must be ^ caretully examined, as to its degree of transparency. FoiMy the - state of the ins. The existence of chronic iritis would indicate a post- ponement of the operation until inflammation has ceased. A thickened ^ kli''-'^^''^ fJTT P^^^^'^"" "^^^ disappeared, IS specially unfitted for operation; as it breaks away under the sLhtest traction, and if cut the wound does not gape, so as to form f per- manent aperture.

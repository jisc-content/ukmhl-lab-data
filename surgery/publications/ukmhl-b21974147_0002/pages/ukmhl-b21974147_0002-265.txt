SHORT-SIGHT AND LONG-SIGHT. 237 impairment of vision—-the degree of impairment being proportionate to the amount of hypermetropia present. The patient is then placed . opposite, and about twenty feet distant from, letters or test types about one-third of an inch in height and breadth, and glasses are successively placed before each eye, beginning with weak ones, and gra,dually in- , creasing their strength till perfect vision is obtained. The strongest ■ glasses the patient can see distinctly with are finally ordered In ; many cases it is found expedient to use somewhat weaker glasses ; in the first instance, and to prescribe the stronger ones only after the patient has become accustomed to the use of spectacles. In the higher forms of hypermetropia, as well as in asthenopia from insuffi- ciency of the internal recti, it becomes requisite to employ prisms ; and, in the latter affection, attention should be paid to the general health of the ;. patient, and all causes tending to produce debility should be removed. Pres&yopm.—This term is applied to the long-sightedness resultino- from flattening of the lens. There is loss of accommodative power and : retrocession of the near point. It commences about the turn of life, • ■ say fifty; reading then becoming more and more difficult. The book is ; held at some distance, even arm's-length, from the eyes ; and there is as T much straining and sense of effort to look at a sufficient distance away : from the object, in order to bring the focus forwards to the retina, as m short-sight to look nearer,—thus to turn the focus backwards to the r retina. This difficulty of long-sightedness increases as age advances. Treatment.—Any endeavour to accustom the eyes to the nearer - range of former years should be abandoned, as being foolish and • prejudicial. Convex spectacles must at once be resorted to ; the lowest ; power which may be required being used first, and increased as the < sight demands. The test of sufficiency in respect to the glasses selected for short-sight or for long-sight is, that the person shall be enabled I to see objects distmctly at the average distances of sight, without any r magnifying effect or sense of effort. Astigmatism or Astigmism.—This term, and—as Dixon suggests— the latter more correctly, signifies an unequal refraction of the rays of light, m passing through the cornea, whereby they do not all converc^e to and meet at one point or focus on the retina. This difference of reti-action IS due to an unsymmetrical form of the cornea, which thus presents different curves of surface, as measured in the vertical ■ transverse, or oblique directions. Originally described by Youn^ .(1801), and subsequently by Professor Airey, each from his own personal experience. Professor Bonders has recently shown that this visual peculiarity is not uncommon. rn^^nf fr""^ '■"^''r' ''^ cylindrical or astigmatic glasses to co^ect the unequal refraction.

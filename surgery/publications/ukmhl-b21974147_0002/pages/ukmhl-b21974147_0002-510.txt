It is tense and eJastic, the more so if intestinal, and in proportion to the accumulation ot serous fluid in the sac; but if omental, the tumour may still retain Its characteristic doughy consistence. Tenderness soon supervenes about the neck of the tumour, and is thence diffused over the abdomen which becomes painful and tympanitic as peritonitis is established' ihe pam varies in kind and degree. Usually referred more particu- larly to the umbilicus, there is a peculiar sensation of constriction across the belly, and perhaps a dragging-down sensation ; or pain mav be slight, or absent throughout. A constricted portion of i7itestme is tunctionally paralyzed, so that its peristaltic action is arrested. The t^ces and flatus accumulate in the intestinal canal above the seat of stricture and complete constipation ensues ; although the bowel below may perhaps act once, and thus somewhat relieve the sense of colicky distension. Or, constipation may be incomplete, if only a portion of the canal of the bowel be constricted. Vomiting soon sets in; first emptying the contents of the stomach, then throwing up bile and mucus, and lastly, the contents of the intestine,—the vomited matters acquiring a more or less decidedly feculent character. Yet, marked remissions of vomiting sometimes occur, as if there were no stran<^ula- +L°^'^T,"^^'^^^^ ^^^^^^ is attended with similar symptoms, excepting that they are less severe, and the constipation is necessarily less marked, ihe symptoms of strangulation, in any case, are more acute if the hernia be recent and small, than if it be old-standing and large. Lastly, the position and respiration of the patient, as influenced by peritonitis, are peculiar. He lies upon his back with the knees drawn up to relax the abdominal walls, for the belly is tender, tense, and tympanitic ; and the breathing is chiefly thoracic, in short, hurried catches, interrupted perhaps by hiccup,—always an unfavourable omen. (2.) Constitutional Symptoms.—Inflammatory fever accom- panies the development of peritonitis, and is denoted by the ordinary symptoms—of a sthenic type in the young and vigorous, asthenic in the old and enfeebled. Usually, the pulse is quick, small, and hard or wiry, and prostration speedily supervenes ; the pulse increasing rapidly in frequency to 100, 120, or more beats per minute, and becoming pro- portionately weak and irregular, as collapse succeeds. A cold, clammy sweat bathes the skin, and the expression of countenance is nipped and anxious ; but there is often a notable relief of all the abdominal symp- toms ; the pain ceasing, the vomiting subsiding, perhaps even the bowels being relieved by an evacuation. Yet, in this deceitful state of tranquillity, the patient lies on the verge of death. Ultimately, with

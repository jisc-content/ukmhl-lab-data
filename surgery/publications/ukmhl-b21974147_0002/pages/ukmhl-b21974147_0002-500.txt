' Adhesion of the omentum across the sac, so as to form a distinct sac or cyst below the visceral contents, and in which fluid accumu- lates constitutes the condition known as hydro- cele ofthe hernial sac. A considerable quantity ot fluid may thus accumulate; some ounces or even pints. It is a rare structural alter- ation m the Hernial sac; one only having been noticed by Curling, one by Boyer, one by Lawrence, two by Pott, and two by Pel- , ^^^^'o- Sometimes, a duplicature of the npri toneum corresponding to a constricted ring externally fo^s ' aescribes it, below the hernial protrusion.

Black spots, or brown and red patches, sometimes beset the peritoneal surface of the sac, and of the visceral protrusion; or these marks may be so diffused as to give a tawny hue to the whole peritoneal surfaces. These appearances are probably the result of eccnymoses, the blood having undergone various changes of colour liiis condition might perhaps be mistaken for gangrene. Loose foreign bodies are occasionally found within the hernial sac • tJiey are usually round, smooth, and firm, varying in size from a pea to a chestnut and single. They consist of a laminated fibrous envelope with a central fatty nucleus; apparently one of the glandulse epiploiciB detached, and encapsuled. Other bodies may be met with of a cartilaginous nature, and which are produced by the detachment of the plates which sometimes form in the walls of an old hernial sac. Jitrangidation.~The structural changes coincident with the strangu- lation ot hernia demand special notice. The visceral protrusion is nipped and indented at the seat of strangulation—the stricture. Other Changes relate to adhesions, the state of the intestine, or omentum, and of the serous fluid in point of its colour, consistence, and odour. Adhesions nl. ?°yv^°"- ^urg. Mus., 1309.

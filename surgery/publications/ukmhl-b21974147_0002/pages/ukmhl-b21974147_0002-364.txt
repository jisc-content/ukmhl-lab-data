SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY, 336 Fir. 69G.* Fig. 697. Fig. 698. drawing asunder the edges of the soft palate, has received considerable attention from various Sur- geons, and thirty years ago Sir W. Fergusson first brought before the profes- sion his method of dividing the muscles from behind ■with his triangular knife. Pollock, Sedillot, and other Surgeons have practised division of the palate mus- cles by making an incision in the soft palate of about an inch in length (see Fig. 699), parallel to the edge of the cleft, but Fergusson's plan possesses the advan- tage of being less likely to interfere with the vascular supply, besides being more scientific. Operation.—The patient being placed upon a table in a good light, and chloroform having been ad- ministered, the mouth should be opened ■with the gag. The first step in the operation consists in passing the tri- angular knife (Fig. 698) behind the palate (Fig. 699), first on one side and then on the other, and pressing it outwards so as to divide the levator palati as it lies between the pterygoid plates. This often causes sharp haemor- rhage, and the pharynx should be kept clear of blood by being frequently swabbed with small sponges. Should the palato-glossus or palato-pharyngns be seen to exercise any action on the sides, their fibres may be snipped with the scissors, the half uvula being drawn towards the median line with smooth forceps, in order to make the muscles tense. The second step consists in paring the edges of the cleft with a fine nai'- row-bladed knife (see Fig. 698)—the merest shaving is sufficient—and the easiest way to effect this is to seize the one half of the uvula with a pair of fine hooked forceps, and, entering the point of the knife close to the forceps, with its back towards the tongue, cnt * The sliding ring passing up ou either side of the hinge keeps the gag iu position; the large end being used for adults, the other for children.

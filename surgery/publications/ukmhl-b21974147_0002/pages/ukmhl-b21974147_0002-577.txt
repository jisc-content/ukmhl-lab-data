549 INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. mesenteric hernia, from internal strangulation by bands (Fig. 828), etc., from peritonitis often resulting in abscess, from simple constipation, from cancer;—in advanced life; from cancer, from thickened intestine the result of old reducible hernia, from intussusception, from simple stricture, and lastly, from internal strangulation. Symptoms, and Diagnosis.—Certain symptoms are common to in- testinal obstruction arising from any cause. And, whether it be acute Fig. 827.* Fig. 828.t or chronic, these symptoms are the same, differing or rather varying only in degree. ISfo definite line of distinction can be drawn between the symptoms in either degree ; the acute subsiding into the chronic, and in this state becoming acute in their severity. Hence, the con- dition, or cause, of obstruction cannot be invariably inferred from the greater or less severity of the symptoms, as the ground of diagnosis. The general symptoms of intestinal obstruc- Fig. 829.J tion are—pain in the abdomen, and localized more especially in some particular part, with abdominal distension, constipation and vomit- ing, followed sooner or later by collapse. In the acute form of these symptoms, intus- susception or invagination of the bowel, at some part of the intestinal canal, as the most common cause of obstruction, will illustrate their usual course. The upper portion of intestine slips into the lower, at the seat of invagination. (Fig. 829.) The patient is seized with abnominal pain, sudden and often acute, which is referred to the seat of injury, perhaps the lower part of the belly; and he seems conscious tha,t something has happened within the abdomen. Flatulent swelling supervenes, with much rum- bling and rolling of the intestines ; a commotion which can be felt and * St. Thomas's Hosp. Mus., E. 19». t Iljifl, R. 14.

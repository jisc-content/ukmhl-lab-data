EXCISION OF THE HIP-JOINT. 37 * Royal Free Hospital. (Author.) either side being protected by a curved retractor. (Fig. 494.) Thi ckain-saw may be used by tliose wbo prefer it. (Fig. 495.) A gougi saw down to tbe line of section; the advantage being the much smaller wound requisite, and with less disturbance of the soft parts. The acetabulum should be scraped rather than gouged, to remove any carious or denuded portion ; or more extensive pelvic excision may be necessary, and has proved successful. But superficial caries, aceta- bular or pelvic, will often recover itself, the former having been main- tained by constant attrition of the femoral head. Any hasmorrhage is easily arrested by torsion. I have never had occasion to apply a single ligature in any hip-joint excision. Excision of the trochanter major may ocasionally prove sufficient; caries of this portion of the femur existing, without disease of the hip-joint. I have had one such case, and with a successful result. The after-treatment of excision, whether of the hip-joint or of the great trochanter alone, is very simple. The limb may be laid straight in bed, and retained in position only by small side pillows or roller sand-bags, without absolutely fixing the thigh; but weight-extension being used just to separate the section end of the femur from contact with the acetabulum. Or a long interrupted splint may be applied simply to fix the limb, without extension (Fig. 496); or, if extension be applied, it is best efiected by a weight from the foot, rather than by Fig. 494.

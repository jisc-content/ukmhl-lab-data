DISEASES OF THE NASAL FOSSiB. 273 Various species of Ulcers are met with, occasionally, within the nasal iossee. Mr. Spencer Watson, in his treatise on Diseases of the Nose, enumerates—erosive Syphilitic Ulcers; Lupoid Ulcer - Ecze- matous Ulcer ; Scorbutic Ulcer; Ulceration in Glanders; in the sequel ""l I^T/A^^ measles, scarlatina, small-pox, and typhus; in paralysis ot the htth pau- of Nerves ; Ulceration of traumatic origin and from foreign bodies in the foss£e. The diagnosis and treatment of these mtra-nasal ulcerative affections form part of the general consideration of the diseases to which they relate. Caries and necrosis may affect any of the hones forming the nasal foss^ ; but here, again, the septum more especially, leading" perhaps to perforation. The nasal bones participating, a marked flattening of the nose IS produced, as the bridge sinks in the course of destruction buch may be the result of syphilitic oz^na. The only special treatment IS the removal of the dead portions of bone with polypus-forceps. (2.) Thiclcening of the Schneiderian Memhrane.—This state of the : nasal mucous membrane not uncommonly occurs throughout the whole . extent of the fossa, and in both nostrDs; frequently the thickenino- or hypertrophy is hmited to the portion of mucous membrane underneath y^rf^'' "P-"''^^ ^^^^ membrane is naturally thick : as Koiliker pomts out, owing to its glandular character and abundant' i almost cavernous, venous plexuses. 8yviptoms.~The affection causes uneasy breathing, especially during . cold and damp weather; there is also perceptible swelling in the nostril -resemblmg polypus; but it is of a deeper red colour-never greyish' isettum Llr'S''^- "'"^ ""^^^ P^l^P'^^' «ituated%n^he .septum nasi.

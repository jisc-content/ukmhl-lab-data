DISEASES OF THE BEEAST. 447 appearances; hard thickened and everted edges, aronnd an irregtilar chasm (Fig 76 /), the surface of which has a greyish-green colour, and dis- charges foul purulent matter. Or, instead of commencing in the adherent integument, and getting deeper, ulceration may begin in the substance of the tumour, by softening and disintegration, and thus come to the surface with discharge. In either way, an ulcer is formed; but while n superficial ulcer has no specific characters, the deep cavity presents t scirrhous ulcer. This ulcer may remain nearly stationary for months or years ; or increase rapidly by sloughing; or throw up large funo'ous granulations and heal by an imperfect cicatrization. But the prolress of the disease, thus hesitating and interrupted, goes on. The ordinarv appearances may be varied, occasionally, by attacks of acute inflamma- tion heemorrhages from the ulcerating surface, or csdema consequent on obstruction of the veins or the lymphatics. The axillary lymphatic glands sooner or later become enlarged and indurated, or assume the form of an agglomerated bunch, adhesion takes place, and they under- go the further course of breast-cancer. In an advanced and^extreSe condition, the mammary gland and axillary glands form almost o^p continuous matted and adherent mass, extending through thTce lular texture, tie lymphatics, and the skin of the breast and alilla; piesent- mg a sort of cuirass-the cancer en ouirasse of French authoS-and which IS accompamed with much oedema of the arm. The supm clavicular and cervical glands may also be implicated. ^ T^nnllv™! °^ the disease, constitutional cachexia sets in nsua ly when the cancer begins to acquire adhesions, particularly to : ^c:^^ '''' 00^^ infecti^n^hen^rJc^eed ..J^^ ^^^^r P^'**"' ^""^ ultimately become th^ Ztf^^'T,'^"'!- intercostal muscleLre a^ected more by the direct infiltration of cancer ^ivinp- vT.p +7 attected ^ dyspncea, and hydrothorax ; but cancer aS^in tL InnST^'' • the bones, and result in fracture, or in the liver or uternr«iT^ ' i^f" ^ escape detection durino- lifp v^x. +• uterus, and possibly ■ ment and Z^T"^' "'^"^^^ <=* '^e breast undergoes arresfof deyelo„ ;tre.e,,^donbtM wl^etHer tiers is a singrin^nce o^^^el'L^S a%1rttttS;:!f,l^^^^^^^^ °' *e g,a.d, or ooeasion- «-d and .edematous, andT^ertVe^rrrnltTtit^Etrr;

616 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. situated just behind the bulb of the urethra—a point which also gives attachment to the sphincter ani, and to the two transverse muscles of the perineum; from this point, a tendinous raphe, in the middle line, gives rise to fleshy fibres, thus forming a symmetrical bipartite muscle, which overlies the bulb and adjoining part of the corpus spongiosum. The two halves of the muscle, for the most part, pass round the spongy urethra, and are united above by a tendinous aponeurosis ; but a band of anterior fibres, on either side, embraces the corpus cavernosum, at the junction of the cms, and are inserted into a fascia on the dorsum of the penis, over the dorsal vessels and nerve. The action of the urethral portion of this muscle is to expel any fluid, urine or semen, from the urethra, at the same time aiding in main- taining the turgescence of the glans penis; while the two penile bands of fibres will aid in maintaining the erectile state of the whole organ. * Arteries of the Perineum, in Male.—v, corpus cavernosum; u, urethra; b, anus; A, ischio-cavernoBus or erector penis muscle; b, bulbo-cavernosus or accelerator urinsB; c, transversus perinei; n, levator ani; E, external sphincter of anus; F, gluteus maximus. Arteries:—I. Trunk of internal pudic. 2. Inferior hicmor- rhoidal. 3. Superficial iwrincal. 4. Transverse perineal. 5. Dorsal artery of iKjnis. 6, Terminal branches of superficial perineal. (From A.

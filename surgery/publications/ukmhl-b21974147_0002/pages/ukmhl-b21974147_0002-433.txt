Et ch outgrowth springs from the adjoining edges of two vertebras and seems to depend on ossification of the radiating costo-vertebral li-rament's, but forming an arch over the intcr-vcrtebral cartilage. Ihus, eacli such arch consists of two pieces, the line of separation being distinct, or they have become fused together. These bony outgrowths are larger and more extensive on the right side.

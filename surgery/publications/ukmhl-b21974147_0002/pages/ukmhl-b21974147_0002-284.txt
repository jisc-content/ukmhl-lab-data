256 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGEllY. and dermoid layers most frequently occur after repeated slight attaclcs of inflammation of the external meatus, extending to the membrane. The transparency and normal lustre are lost, the membrane being of a dirty grey or yellowish colour. This may be distinguished from opacities arising from thickening of the mucous membrane by the clearness with wbich the handle and short process of the malleus can be seen ; for, while a very slight thickening of the epidermic layer renders the manubrium indistinct, a marked opacity of the mucous membrane only does not exclude a view of this portion of the malleus. The opacity last named is the most frequent, as it arises from catarrh of the cavity of the tympanum—probably the most common affection of the middle ear. In the first stages of acute catarrh of the cavity the membrane presents a glistening reddish or copper-coloured appear- ance, from the congestion of the mucous membrane. This condition does not last long, and is rarely seen by the Surgeon. It soon loses its lustre and becomes dull and grey. In chronic cases where an accumulation of mucus has been lying long m contact with the membrane, it assumes a yellowish, sodden appearance, like parch- ment steeped in fluid. The middle layer soon participates m the thickening, and causes the manubrium to be slightly hidden; and should the dermoid layer also become affected, the course of the bone can only be followed by the line of congestion showing the position of the manubrial plexus. Cretaceous deposits are found m the membrana tympani. They may occur in persons whose bearing is normal, but are usually accompamed by a high degree of deafness. They a^e generally of a ^rescentic shape, in front of or behmd the manu- brium ; or they may be found in the shape of a horse-shoe, occupynig the lovver two-thirds of the circumference. They are less frequently seen radiating from the manubrium to the periphery These deposits are commonly the result of old otorrhoeas, the exudation into the sub- stantL propria having calcified. The peripheral opacities of old ■ people, wHch appear to be analogous to arcus senilis of the comea are formed by the infiltration of fatty globu es, where the circular fibres are thickest. The changes of inclination and curvature are dependent on dosure of the Eustachian tube, adhesions to the walls o the cav'w contraction of the tensor tympani, accumulations of pus Ind mucus or tumours internal and external to the cavity, perforations, and Twnn ng or thickening of the membrane.

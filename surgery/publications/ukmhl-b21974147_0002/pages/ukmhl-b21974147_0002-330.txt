Submental Operations.—Three methods have been practised for removing the tongue by procedures beneath the jaw. The puncture and ecraseur operation, devised by Mr. Nunneley is readily performed. The tongue having been transfixed by a couple' of strong curved needles, passed from the floor of the mouth and proiectin? on the upper surface of the tongue, which had been drawn forward with a vulsellum, as in the preceding opera- tions, a stout-bladed needle, attached by ligature to the noose of an ecraseur, is thrust through the floor of the mouth from •under the chin, the needle being made to penetrate in the middle line, and about midway between the os hyoides and the chin, so that the point emerges in the mouth by the side of the fr^num of the tongue; the loop of the ecraseur is drawn up and the needle detached; then the tongue is drawn forward through the noose (Pig. 681, show- ing also operation by submental incision), which must be planted beliind the pins as usual (omitted in figure), and the organ is excised by slowly working the instrument. On withdrawing the noose through the sub- mental puncture, the narrow track of the wound has a somewhat lacerated surface, but this is of little consequence in the pro- cess of healing._ The operation has proved very effectual as a method of complete excision; and it is far more conservative than either of the remaining submental operations, both of which will probably fall into disuse. Large portions of the tongue have been successfully extirpated by Eegnoli's operation;—simply an incision into the floor of the mouth,. extending, under the jaw, from one angle of the bone to the other; a vertical incision in the middle of this, from the hyoid bone forwards, will enable the tongue to be more readily drawn downwards through the opening, and nearly the whole organ can then be removed. Syme's operation, similar to that by Sedillot, for complete extirpa- tion, consists in making an incision through the middle of the lower lip and carrying it over the chin down to the hyoid bone; the sym- physis of the jaw is sawn through, and the mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, and genio-hyoglossi muscles separated; the two halves of the bone are drawn asunder, and the larynx is drawn forwards, thus exposing the whole tongue down to its very root,—the hyoid attachments.

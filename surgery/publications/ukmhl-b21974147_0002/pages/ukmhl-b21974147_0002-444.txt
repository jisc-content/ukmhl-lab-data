Various rjymnastir exercises have been recommended, and may be of some use ; but the ordinary exercise of walking and running will probably bring both sides of the body into equal action, and the spine naturally regain a straiglit direction. This result will be promoted by due attention to the fm- provement of the genei'al health, on ordinary principles of treatment. In single lateral dorsal curvature, unaccompanied by any com- FiG. 749.

In a more advanced stage, and as dotible lateral curvature, some other mechanical means must be had recourse to for the gradual cor- rection of this deformity. Various contriv- ances are used, and still more have been con- structed ; some specialists in this branch of surgery seeming to vie with each other in designing the most complicated apparatus. The thorax, bulging backwards and outwards at the angle of the scapula ; and the hip or haunch, projecting backwards and outwards; both require support, equal and opposite in these directions. The simple "oblique bandage" answers this purpose very well, so far as regards the bearings of the support. Or, a contrivance, similar in character to that used for angular curvature, may be worn, to relieve the weight of the trunk by crutch-supports; whereby also the varying degrees of lateral pressure requisite, can be better regulated by a rack and pinion worked by a key. The primary dorsal curve may, it would seem, be " unfolded," by extending its extremities (Fig. 750) ; in this Avay restoring the line of

BRONCHOCELB, OR GOITRE. 383 with jerking of the carotids, and the general symptoms—palpitation of the heart and prominent eyeballs—will complete the diagnosis. Causes.—Common bronchocele, hypertrophy of the thyroid gland, occurs mostly in women, and commences about the age of puberty in this country. It may, however, be congenital, but not enlarge until puberty. It is frequently associated with some derangement of the : menstrual function, and with an anemic state of the general health. Hence the females affected have a pallid, weak, miserable appearance". Pregnancy alone not unfrequently induces enlargement of the thyroid . gland. Endemic influence is remarkable; the disease prevails in Derby- - shire, Nottingham, and the chalky parts of England; in the valleys of the Alps, Apennines, and Pyrenees. In Savoy, Switzerland, the Tyrol, : and Carinthia, there are villages in which all the inhabitants, without : exception, have these swellings. The hygienic cause generally assio-ned under these circumstances—the use of melted snow, or of water impreo-- nated with calcareous or earthy particles—is not established with reo-ard r to the localities most productive of the disease. But it does arise in low, damp situations chiefly, and under hygienic circumstances favour- : able to ansemia and debility. The disease is often associated with ■ cretimsm and idiocy; seeming to have an hereditary character in im- perfect physical and mental development.

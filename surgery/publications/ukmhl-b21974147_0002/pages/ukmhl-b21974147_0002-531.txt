503 INGUINAL HERNIA. intruinal hernia ; but they become so altered in appearance and united by'pressure, as to have mucli less importance surgically. The relations of the inguinal canal, spermatic cord and testicle, to the visceral protrusion, and of the deep epigastric artery to the mouth of the sac, are specially important. The inguinal canal is the interval between the abdominal parietes, Fig. 783.* just above the inner half of Poupart's ligament; it extends obliquely downwards and inwards, about one inch and a half in length, from the internal abdominal ring to the external abdominal ring at the crest of the pubes. Its boundaries, and thence the relations of inguinal hernia in the canal, are thus formed:â€”anteriorly, by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, and beneath by the arched fibres of the internal oblique, over the outer half-inch of the canal, and the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique alone, the inner inch ; posteriorly, by the fascia transversalis and the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, the fascia extending along the outer half- inch of the canal, corresponding to the internal oblique, and the con- joined tendon, with the fascia transversalis behind it, along the inner inch, corresponding to the aponeurosis of the external oblique. In- feriorly, the floor of the canal is formed by the junction of the fascia * a, external oblique muscle reflected; h b, internal oblique, arching over and covering the internal abdominal ring ; c, transversalis muscle; d, conjoined tendon ; e, rectus muscle, sheath opened ; /, fascia transversalis; r/, triangular aponeurosis ol'coujoined tendon; /i, cremastor ; iuf'undibuliibrm fascia.

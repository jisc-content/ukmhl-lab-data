This ctd-de- sac, broad behind in the interval between the iliac arteries on either ui J^J^ rectum, narrows forwards, and is tucked, as it were, under the bladder. In front is a triangular space, where the base of the bladder lies free of peritoneum, and attached to the rectum by the recto-vesical fascia^r the apex of this space touches the prostate, its base behind as hmited by the peritoneal pouch, and the sides are bounded by the vasa deferentia, and the seminal vesicles outside these tubes, as both converge forwards to enter the prostate gland. In this space the bladder is punctured j;er recii««, to relieve retention of urine. Usually, the recto-vesical pottch of peritoneum extends forwards to a point coi-responding to about one inch and a half from the tip of the coccyx, or about four inches distant from the anus; sometimes, however, the pouch reaches forwards to the prostate, leaving no triangular space iincovered at the base of the bladder. In the female, the base of the bladder rests upon the anterior wall of the vagina, and further back on the lower part of the uterus, these organs being placed between tbe bladder and rectum. The idero^esical pouch of peritoneum extends torwards only as far as between the utenis and bladder, leaving the vagina uncovered and adherent to the bladder at the fore part of its base. ihe posterior surface of the bladder is in contact with the rectum, or, in the female, with the uterus; but this surface of the bladder is

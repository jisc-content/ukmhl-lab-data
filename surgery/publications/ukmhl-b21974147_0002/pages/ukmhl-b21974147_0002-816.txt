788 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. Fig. 932.* immediate cause of extravasation seems to be ulceration of tbe mucons membrane, either from urinary irritation, or as the result of an abscess forming close to this part of the urethra, externally, and which induces ulceration into the canal. The urine escaping from the urethra, or becoming extravasated into the adjoining cellular tissue, gradually infiltrates this texture beneath the deep layer of the super- ficial fascia in the perineum; and the flaid following the boundaries of this fascia, it forms a bag, limited by the base of the triangular liga- ment below, and the rami of the pubes laterally; thence continuing upwards, the scrotum and penis become infiltrated, then the lower part of the abdomen, and outwards to the line of Poupart's ligament on either side ; but there is no extension downwards on the thighs. The sijm;ptoms of extravasation are remarkable:—the characteris- tically bounded swelling, and its increasing size and extent; the scrotum and penis especially becoming enormously distended,—the one per- haps to the size of a large cocoa-nut, the other to that of a Bologna sausage; a sensation of sudden relief of the distended bladder is immediately followed by an acute burning sensation in the perineum; gangrenous inflammation of the cellu- lar texture soon supervenes, the skin assumes a dusky-red hue, purplish or black gangrenous spots appear, and frequently one such patch is seen on the dorsum of the penis. Ultimately, sloughing of the skin and cellular texture of the scrotum exposes the testicles, bare and pendulous. Sometimes the urethra bursts just in front of the bulb; when, in addition to the swelling of ordi- nary extravasation, the urine infiltrates also the corpus spongiosum of the penis, which is soon followed by gangrene of the glans, in the form of black spots or having a generally black appear- ance ; thus indicating this further urinary extra- vasation. (Fig. 932.) The constitutional disturb- ance is that of low typhoidal depression; a rapid feeble pulse, dry brown or black tongue, and muttering delirium as ^^''TheX^To'^.S might be misled by the resemblance of the -swelling to that of phlegmonous erysipelas ; but the ^bo^^^^^^'^^^f,^'^^^^^^^^^^ connection with the retention of urine, will mdicate the nature of the Tr'eatmenL-^he primary indication of treatment is to give an im- mediate, free, and dependent outlet to ^« ^^^rav^^^^^^^^T^' fcBtid pm-ulent fluid and sloughs of cellular texture ^^^^^^ This indication is, therefore, both preventive and remedial Hence an incision or two should be made in the scrotum on e^^he Jide of the middle line ; exposing the cellular texture, and ^jtendrng W the front to the back of the bag.

Purulent catarrh Xh in a heoUr constitutions, from! injuries or influences wmcJi in a healthy person would cause simple catarrh; but it is more frequently the result of the acute exanthemata :-scarlet fever, meaTs small-pox, and also typhus fever and phthisis. ' While pam and fever are present, leeches should be placed round the ear, the meatus filled frequently with warm water, and opiates and purgatives given. But the most important step in the treatment IS to give the pus every opportunity of free exit from the cavity by natural or artificial • channels. The Eustachian tube must be kept open by the use of the air douche, either by means of the catheter or i ohtzer s bag; and if there is great bulging of the membrane, and urgent symptoms are present, paracentesis will be necessary. When otorrhcea has occurred in consequence of perforation of the membrane, the ear should be frequently syringed with warm water, to which an astringent or antiseptic has been added. The astringent employed may also be made to pass through the cavity and through the Eusta- chiaji tube by filling the meatus of each ear with the solution, the patient keeping it there until a current of air is made to pass throuo-h the Eustachian, whereupon the fluid in the external canals will rush into the cavity and down through the Eustachian tube ; or by iniectin^ It forcibJy from the meatus. Constitutional treatment will also be required. The purulent catarrh of children is frequently unnoticed untU serious changes have resulted. The screaming of the child, which is loud and persevering, is increased by every movement of the body especially of the head; and it at length refuses to suck. These cases seldom come before the Surgeon until the membrane has been ruptured and the pus is escaping from the external meatus. Should the Surgeon see the child before this happens, he may do something to relieve the pam and prevent the destruction of useful structures, by some of the remedies recommended in otitis media, witli the free opening of any enlargement over the mastoid process. The principal cause of this affection is scarlet fever, though measles and typhus fever also contri- bute to the number. There is a prejudice, amongst both the laity and the profession, against stopping any chronic discharge from the ear by treatment. But this cannot be too severely combated; for, though discharge may be present for a long time without pain or inconvenient deafness, com- plications—such as polypi, paralysis of the facial nerve, and caries—may occur at any time, and deafness to some extent is almost sure ultimately to supervene. Labyrmthine Deafness.—The chief symptoms of this class of dis- eases are great deafness—coming on gradually or acquired suddenly- tinnitus, and frequently vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and pain.

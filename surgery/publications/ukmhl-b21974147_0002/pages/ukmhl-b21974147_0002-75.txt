47 SUBCUTANEOUS SECTION OF THE FEMUR. This operative procedure has since been practised in twenty-one cases, collected by Mr. Adams;* Mr. T. R. Jessop, of Leeds, having had the second case ; followed by Mr. Furneaux Jordan, of Bir- FiG. 502. Fig. 504 mingham; Mr. F. W. Jowers, of Brighton; Dr. Sands, of New York; Mr. Lund, of Manchester; Mr. T. Bryant, and other Surgeons. In this series of cases, eighteen were successful, which, with Mr. Adams's first case, makes a total of nineteen, out of the whole number, twenty-two ; leaving a proportion of three deaths. Of the successful cases, in two, both hips were submitted to operation. It is important also to note that only one case was fatal from pytemia; in the other two, subcutaneous section was followed by sup- puration and necrosis, for which exarticulation of the hip proved fatal, or death ensued from prolonged suppuration and kidney disease at the end of eight months. The merits of Mr. Adams's operation are now sufficiently verified by accumulated experience in the hands of different Surgeons, as to leave no doubt of its future success, when properly per- formed—by the subcutaneous method—and in properly selected cases of hip-joint disease, result- ing in osseous anchylosis, with useless malposi- tion of the limb. (Fig. 504.) But there are two classes of cases to which subcutaneous section of the neclc of the femur is inapplicable; the resulting anchylosis and malposition of the limb being the same. Firstly, scrofulous disease of the hip-joint, in an advanced stage ; * " Med. Chir. Trans.," Ix., 1877. f Royal Free Hospital Mus.

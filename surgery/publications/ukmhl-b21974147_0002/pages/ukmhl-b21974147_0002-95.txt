EESULTS OF SHOULDER-JOINT EXCISION. 67 If possible, the circumflex arteries. Any carious portion of the glenoid cavity may be scraped with a gouge. As a rule, with very rare . exceptions, the glenoid cavity should not be excised. The flap is replaced, or the linear incision closed, and retained by sutures ; and the arm, with an axillary pad, may be bound to the chest, as for fractured clavicle; or supported on a pillow, extending as a splint : from the axilla. Subsequently, the forearm must be supported in a sling, and the arm gradually brought into useful motion. Uesults of Excision of the Shoulder-joint.—(1.) In relation to Life, or 1 the Mortality.—Statistics are not, at present, sufficiently comprehensive ! to establish more than one general conclusion respecting this question. The average mortality appears to be 1 in 5, or 6; 20 per cent., or : about 16 per cent., respectively. Of 50 cases, collected by Dr. Hodges, : 8 died ; 1 in 6, or about 16 per cent.; and in 7 of the 8 fatal cases, the ; glenoid cavity had been interfered with. Of the 30 cases in the Hospital collection below, the death-rate was nearly 1 in 4, or 25 per I cent. Author's Collection. (1.) Royal Infirmary, Edmburgh; period, 1865-69. (Per Mr. P. H. Watson.)

No cases. (2.) State of the Limb.—In four of the fifty cases collected by F Hodges, the operation was unsuccessful; leaving a balance of forty-six > successful cases. The average ijeriod of recovery, with some use of the limb, as calcu- lated from thirty-one of the cases, was four months; "a much longer ■period, however, than this elapsed, before the limb could be said to 'become really serviceable." The resulting state of the joint would seem to be, that the limb can never be elevated above the horizontal line, while in many cases it hangs down without any power whatever in the deltoid, at a greater or less distance from the scapula. But the movements of flexion, extension, and adduction are usually free; abduction can often be effected to the extent of raising the arm considerably from the side ; and there is generally sufficient power in the forearm to carry heavy ' weights, and perform many of the ordinary domestic tasks. The arm -18, therefore, a very useful one, irrespective of the vast importance of preserving the hand, and thus the person is enabled to follow many ot the ordinary trades.

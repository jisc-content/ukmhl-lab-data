Encysted hemia.-The operation presents the pecubarity of a double sac ; an anterior one, the tunica vaginalis, enveloping the true Perito- nea hernial sac. (See Fig. 792.) The former, r^^^^^'t^^^^^Pff,^' exposing a serous cavity, but no hernial contents; behind bes the hernial sac, invested externally by the glistemng surface of the opened tunica vaginalis, the conjoined surfaces forming a double serous layer; the hernial tumour, with the testis attached below, is remarkably mov- able, and readily tumbles out through the aperture m the tunica vaffinaUs, as a pyriform mass, suspended only by its attachment to the margin of the external abdominal ring. Proceeding with the_ opera- tion the double serous layer is divided, thus opening the hernial sac ; which contains, as in other bernise, intestine, omentum, or bpth._ _ ihe stricture will usually be found at the neck of the sac ; this is divided, and the operation completed by reducing the protrusion.

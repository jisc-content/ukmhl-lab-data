Hence absolute rest m the horizontal position mtst be observed, in ofder to prevent any motion affecting the vertebrae, and to relieve the wei'ht o Fig. 740. the_ trunk from the spinal column. A prone couch (Fig. 740), the patient lying on her belly, answers this purpose best. It should be constructed so as to admit of being raised to a varying angle with the floor, and thus render the position more tolerable than au ab.solntely horizontal posture. The prone position of the patient is preferable to the recumbent, as the angular prominence of the spine escapes com- pression and any tendency to congestion affecting the diseased ver-

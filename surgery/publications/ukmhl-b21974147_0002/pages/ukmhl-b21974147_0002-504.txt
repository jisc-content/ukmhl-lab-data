This tumour increases in size when the patient stands, and still more so when he coughs, and the latter act commumcates an impulse more or less perceptible to the hand when placed upon the tumour; on the contrary, it diminishes in the recumbent posture, and can be made to disappear by gentle com- pressive manipulation m the direction of protrusioS,-the contents of the hernial sac, with sometimes the sac itself, being returned into the abdomen, whence this procedure is denominated the reduction of nnvSf; ^^11. probably reappear, when the patient stands upright, and the pressure is removed from the hernial aperture.

Epiplocele IS doughy or harder, inelastic, and uneven or lobulated; yields a less distinct and a solid impulse on coughing, and returns slowly, bit by bit or as a lump, into the abdomen. Percussion cannot be trusted to distinguish intestine from omentum; for if there be f^cal accumula- tion—solid or fluid—m the bowel, the sound elicited from that struc- ture, or from omentum, will be equally dull. Entero-epiplocele forms a tumour of mixed characters, and this is the more frequent condition of hernia; or examination fails to detect the visceral natui-e of the pro- trusion,—whether it be intestine, omentum, or both. An accumulation ot fluid m the hernial sac will disguise the visceral nature of its con- tents, and simulate intestine. Thus, in one case of apparently scrotal enterocele, I found, by operation, only half the diameter of a knuckle ot small intestine protruded at the external abdominal ring, and the sac distended with serous fluid. Various kinds of swelling in the regions of Hernia simulate that disease; but their diagnosis will be more usefully noticed in describing bpecial Herniee. Treatment.—This may be mechanical and palliative, or operative and curative. (1.) Mechanical treatment consists in the reduction or return of hernia, by the inanipulative procedure technically named the Taxis; and the prevention of its return, by means of a suitably fitting support

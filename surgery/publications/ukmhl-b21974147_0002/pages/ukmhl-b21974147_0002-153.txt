125 AMPUTATION OP THE THIGH. Fig. 581. outwards to the surface. (Fig. 581.) Entering the knife again, about an inch lower than the upper limit of the former incision, and passing it behind the bone to the same point on the other side of the thigh, a pos- terior flap is made of cor- responding length and shape. The advantage of re-entering the knife as directed, is not to jag the integument by the altera- tion of level necessary to transfix the thigh, in lowering it under the bone. Both flaps should be now retracted by an assistant, the knife swept round the bone at the highest point, and the bone sawn transversely across by a light vertical action of the saw. (Fig. 582.) The leg assistant must ob- serve to evenly support the Fig. 582. limb, as the bone is divided; not to lock the saw by elevating the limb, nor to snap and splinter the bone by allowing the limb to drop. The artery and any muscular branches must then be seized with artery- forceps (Fig. 583), and secured by ligature; or by acupressure, or torsion; and the flaps evenly ad- justed with sutures. Liston's method of am- putation by antero-pos- terior flaps consisted in the peculiarity of making the posterior flap longer than the anterior, so as to allow for tlie greater retraction of the flexor muscles, and thus balance the flaps. Silence's method consists in the con- verse peculiarity of making the an- terior flap the longer of the two; and the additional difEerence of transfixing the limb quite two inches below the line where the bone is to be sawn. The flaps have a tendency to retract gradually to the point of transfixion ; and thus, after Liston's operation, the greater retraction of the posterior flap will tend to draw the line of cicatrix towards the centre of the end of the stamp, and thus make it correspond to the end of the bone; whereas, after Spence's operation, by the same Fig. 583.

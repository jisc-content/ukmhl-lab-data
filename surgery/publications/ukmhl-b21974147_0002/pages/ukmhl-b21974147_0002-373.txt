The malar bone and the orbital plaie of the superior maxilla, forming the floor of the orbit, may be sound ; then, a groove having been made with a small saw, across from the nasal process of the maxillary to the outer margin of the malar bone, the separation is completed with the forceps, including the remainder of the bone as above described. Modificwtions of this Operation have been practised with success loy Sir W. Pergusson. „ (a.) A transverse incision, slightly curved, may be made from the iunction of the malar bone below the eye across to the nasal process,, instead of curving downwards into the angle of the mouth. _ Consider- able htemorrhage will thus be avoided, and the other incision may be made as already indicated. , „ , j > (b) A single incision from the angle of the mouth upwards and outwards, has enabled him to remove tumours of some size ; or an incision through the centre of the upper lip to the base of the columna and into the nostril, has afforded sufficient space for the removal o^ tumours of such size as it would be.^deemed advisable to operate on.

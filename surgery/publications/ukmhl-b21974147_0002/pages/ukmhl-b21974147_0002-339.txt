DENTIGEBOUS CYSTS.—SYPHILITIC TEETH. 311 Dentigerous cysts are painless, of slow growth, even outline, and, when the bone is sufficiently thinned, yield a crackling sensation to pressure under the finger. They contain a glairy, transparent fluid, enclosed in a sac of moderate thickness. The teeth which have caused them have been sometimes found loose in the cavity, sometimes very firmly implanted in a portion of the bony wall. Of course, an important guide to a correct diagnosis will be the absence of one of the teeth from its proper place. It is, however, quite possible that a dentigerous cyst might be found in connection with a supernumerary, so that the presence of the normaV number of teeth would not absolutely exclude the possibility of a particular tumour being a dentigerous cyst. Many instances of needless resections of large portions of the jaw, owing to the true nature of these enlargements not having been diagnosed, are on record. The constitutional taint of Syphilis is capable of modifying the teeth during the period of their development, and of imprinting upon fJiem a characteristic deformity. This was first pointed out by Mr. Hutchinson ; it has been doubted by several writers, who have opposed to his conclusions general impressions, and has been confirmed by others, who have closely investigated and have brought forward particular- •ases; and it may now, I think, be fairly accepted as proven. A normal incisor is wider (or as wide) at its cutting edge than at any other point, and is, when unworn, to a slight extent trilobed, havino- three faintly marked cusps or prominences along its edge. A syphilitic tooth is narrower at its cutting edge than elsewhere, and the edge is concave, without trace of the three cusps. They may thus be''de- scribed as peg-shaped; and, although the alteration is most striking in the incisors, a similar effect is produced upon the molars by the sup- pression of the normal cusps, their tops then becoming dome-shaped; but the teeth are not necessarily rugged, nor otherwise defective in structure, as was pointed out by Mr. Moon. In aU the teeth a similar deviation from the normal pattern has taken place. At the period of birth, or soon after, there has been a tendency to the dwarfing and suppression of the characteristic form of the tooth-pulps—hence those portions of teeth first formed are stunted; but, as time goes on, the tooth-pulps attain more nearly to taeir normal dimensions, and the last-formed portions of the teeth are Jess aberrant. The canine teeth being later in their calcification than tlie mcisors, have less of their bulk modified, and only their extreme tips are deformed. It was supposed, by Mr. Hutchinson, that this clwarting of the teeth was due to the somewhat direct influence of stomatitis early in life ; but, on grounds whicb I have given elsewhere feystem of Dental Surgery," p. 217), it seems more probable that the jpnilitic poison acts by directly modifying the nutrition of this p ut, as it does that of many other parts, and especially dermal struc- tures other than the teeth. r j- d.i bciuc flnrn^^l 7?^^^^^^^ ^^^^ malformatiou was first suspected tnrongh the very constant association of teeth of this form wi'th chronic interstitial keratitis. ,rnJ^v^^^ ^^^'^^ ^""^ ^^^^^^ " honey-combed " or "crag^v" from tho oS'l^etlrT^'f r '^'Tr' V ^^^^^ '^^y arfincompletei; --ovciecl, arc by Mr. Hutchmson believed to be a result of the admin-

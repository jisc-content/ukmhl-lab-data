DISEASES OF THE BKEAST. 449 This kind of cancer is usually associated with scirrhus or encepha- loid. ^ The causative relation of age and uterine activity to cancer of the breast, is diagnostically important. Prom the fortieth to the fiftieth year, or the fifth decade of life, is the age most subject to this disease as affectmg the breast. Of 158 cases collected by Paget and 62 by Lebert, the disease appeared in 22 only before thirty years of ao-e Before twenty years of age, Mr. Birkett has never seen a case. Bat Mr. Lyford and Mr. B.

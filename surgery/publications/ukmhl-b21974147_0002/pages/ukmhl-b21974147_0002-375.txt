The patient, a woman, aged forty-six at the date of the first operation, made a good recovery after the secon^^ operation. She lived for fourteen years, and could chew with the front teeth so as to eat animal food. Post-mortem exammation showed that the space on either side of the symphysis was occupied by a veiy dense structure, giving attachment to the masseter and mternal pterygoid (2 ) The entire jaw can be removed en masse, by an incision carried round, and a disarticulation corresponding to that for the removal of half the bone. , ,. ... -u^ During the process of healing by granulation, the patient must be fed with liquid food, spooned into the mouth or sucked through a tube. A dense fibrous tissue gradually forms a kind of substitute ]aw ; and, especially when the articulations are left untouched, the movements and appearance of the lower part of the face are far more perfect than might be expected. It has often occurred to me that some kind ot artificial supplementary jaw, with teeth, might be fixed upon the fibrous matrix, and, when an appropriate opportunity offers, I shall endeavour to put this notion into practice. My earhest recollections ot these operations on the jaws date back to their memorable performance by Mr. Liston, at the University College Hospital; and, although upwards of thirty years have elapsed since first I witnessed such an opera- tion, the scene—ere the days of chloroform or ether—of the master operator, with his massive hand, snapping through the jaw-bone of the patient seated before him, the group of assistants, and the multitude of students in the theatre—lives in my memory with the freshness of yesterday.

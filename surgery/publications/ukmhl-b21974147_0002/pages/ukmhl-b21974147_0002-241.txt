DISEASES OP THE IKIS. 213 operation are that the patient being in the recnmbent position, in a good light, and the lids being separated with a speciilnm, the conjunc- tiva is seized with a pair of fixing forceps (Fig. 620) on the side opposite to that on which the knife is to be entered. A knife with a triangular blade, which is either straight, or bent at an angle with the handle, and is called a keratome, is then slowly introduced at the point of junction of the cornea with the sclerotic, or a little behind Fro. 621.t this point, care being taken that the point of the blade neither scrapes the cornea nor wounds the iris. (Fig. 621.) After the opening has been made of sufficient size—and it is better to make it too large than too small—on the with- drawal of the knife, which should be done slowly, a pair of curved iridectomy forceps are introduced through the wound, with the blades in contact. On opening and again closing them, a portion of iris of the required size can be seized and drawn out of the wound, when it is to be divided with scissors. (Fig. 622.) When iridectomy is performed for posterior synechia;, the piece of iris seized with the forceps should be withdrawn with the greatest gentleness and care, lest the capsule of the lens be torn through. Haemorrhage sometimes Fig. 622.$ takes place into the anterior cham- ber, and obscures the steps of the operation. In old cases of iritis the iris becomes either tough or friable, and only small strips or fibres can be torn away. The after-treatment consists in the application of a pad and bandage, and rest for a few days. In favourable cases, when the operation has been done skilfully, the subsequent pain and irritation are very slight. If, however, in an unhealthy eye, the capsule of tae lens have been injured, panophthalmitis may set in, requiring the excision of the globe.

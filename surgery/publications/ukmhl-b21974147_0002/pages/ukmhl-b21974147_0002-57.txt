29 ANALYSIS OF CASES OF KNEE-JOINT EXCISION. cartilages of the femur and tibia; fibrous anchylosis, with rctractiou of the leg—the toes touching the ground, and partial dislocation ot the femur forwards and outwards. Excision. Accidental detachment of tibial epiphysis, its removal, with the articular end of the femur through its epiphysis; also the patella. Eecovery without a bad symptom. Besult—Feviod since operation, seven years. (Fig. 492.) Analysis of the Cases.—(1.) Conditions of Disease.—Caries in all cases, -with, the destruction of the articular cartilages of both the femur and tibia. In Case 1 the femur was chiefly affected, in Case 6 the tibia, and m the other ten cases both bones were about equally affected. The patella was healthy m nearly all cases. (2) Commencement of Hie Disease.—Synowitis in six cases—1, 10, 11, IZ; scrofulous caries in the other six cases. Cause; traumatic m eleven cases; consti- tutional in Case 2. . , ^ ,. /-i i j • (3 ) Duration vf Disease, and of Treatment previous to Operation.—Cane 1: disease 6 years- treatment occasionally. Case 2: disease 5 years; 4 months' treatment Case 3: disease 5i years; 2 years' treatment. Case 4 : disease 1 year; 9 months treatment. Case 5: disease 12 years; occasional treatment. Case 6: disease 6^ years; occasional treatment. Case 7 : disease 1 year; 10 months' treatment Case 8: disease 14 years; treatment occasionally. Case 9: disease 7 years; and equally prolonged treatment. Case 10: disease 14 years; treatment in two Metropolitan Hospitals, Case 11: disease 13 years; treatment 1 year m a Metropolitan Hos- pital, then in a special Hospital. Case 12 : disease 10 months; treatment m two Metropolitan Hospitals, then in the Eoyal Free Hospital. _ (4.) The constitutional disorder had not advanced to hectic and emaciation m any of the twelve cases except in Case 3. In Case 1, nervous exhaustion ; 2, health good; 4, health irregular, digestion impaired ; 5, marked ansamia; 6, health good ; 7, health good; 8, health good; 9, health delicate, with constant cough; 10, health reduced; 11, health good; 12, health good. , , n Pregnancy, without miscarriage, at the time of excision ; parturition at the full period, mother and child well; in Case 10. (5.) Age and to.-Age: 33, 27, 18, 20, 18, 5, 20, 17, 10, 20, 16, and 9 years. Sex: six males and six females. (6.) Operation.—The incision was semilunar downwards from condyle to condyle in all the cases. The portions of bone excised were the articular ends of the femur and tibia in all the cases, with additional portions of cancellated bone in Cases 1 and 6. The patella was removed in all cases. The synovial membrane was also removed as much as possible in Cases 2 and 7 of chronic synovitis. Bxmorrhage was inconsiderable during the operation in all the cases ; no ligatures were required, the articular vessels being secured by torsion and exposure. Sutures—metallic in Case 1, silk in the subsequent eight cases. Dressings—water dressings in Cases 1 and 3, weak carbolic lotion in the other ten cases. Splints—a back-splint and an outside interrupted splint, with foot-piece, in all cases, except 1 and 3. (7.) Primary Union.—Complete, except just at angles of the incision, in Cases 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, or in seven cases; partial in Cases 1, 3, 4, 5, 11, or in five cases. Secondary hajmorrhage in Cases 3, 5, and 8 ; arrested by ice in the first case, by ligature in the latter two. Sloughing or ulceration from pressure in two cases, 5 and 10. (8.) Intervals of Eemoval of Splints.—Average period one month after operation, and at similar periods subsequently; making only three or four reapplications of the retentive apparatus in each case. (9.) Results.—Osseous or firm union,and a straight limb,in all the cases; except Case 3, where it was incomplete; Cases 4 and 5, which were subjected to amputa- tion ; and Case 11, the only death, and from acute tetanus in thirty-six hours, seven- teen days after operation. Period of union, average three months. Afterwards the limb became slightly bowed in two cases—2 and 6; the latter a child aged five. (10.) Ee-excision in Case 5—a scrofulous case. (11.) Secondary Amputation in Cases 4 and 5—both scrofulous cases; also in the questionable Case 3—a scrofulous case. (12.) I'ermnnent Result.—Ultimate known period: (1) 19 years ; (2) 1\ year; (6) li year; (7) 1 year; (8) li year; (9) li year; ,(10) G months; (12) 7 years. In this series of typical cases for excision of the knee-joint, it should be observed that all of them relate cither to scrofulous caries

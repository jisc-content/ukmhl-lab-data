810 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGEEY. Diseases of the Testis and Cord. Associated with the Testis and the Scrotum, the Tqnica Vaoinaiis intervening between the two, may be the seat of certain disLsed con' ditions ■ Ilydrocele, and Ha^matocde, in their ordinary forms as s4n" ij ng either an accumulation of serous fluid, or an eftusx^ of b ood :^e^^vj^.r-^' ^-'^^ - Diseases of the Testis and Cord specially comprise five generic conditions :—(1) Inflammation or Orchitis a,nd Epididyvutis; (2) Chronic fnlargemerd-SyphiUtio and Scrofulous; (3) T^.mo^.r.,_Fibrous Cart! lagxnous.

Neuralgia; Congenital Malpo£ _ Htdrocele.—In the widest acceptation of the term, Hydrocele signifies an accumulation of serous fluid, in connection with the Testis or fepermatic Cord. Ordinarily, the fluid is collected in the tunica vaginalis, envelopiu<. the testis; sometimes, m a cyst or cysts, variously situated relatively either to the testis, or m the course of the spermatic cord. Hence Hydroceles may be divided into that of the Tunica Vaginalis Testis] and the Encysted forms, as relating either to the Testis or to the Cord _ An accumulation of serous fluid in the tunica vaginalis may occur m two conditions of the sac; either when the vaginal process of peri- toneuni has become obliterated, whereby the fluid is contained in a distinct sac,—constituting the common form of Hydrocele ; or when that tubular prolongation of peritoneum remains unobliterated, so that the fiuidis contained m a sac which communicates with the general peritoneal cavity,—constituting Congenital Hydrocele. _ Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis.—The serous fluid is accumulated m a distant sac, enveloping the testis; and this organ, somewhat en- larged, is usually situated at the lower and back part of the sac. (Fig. 941.) Sometimes the testis is flattened and spread out by constant pressure of the fluid; and the epididymis is then elon- gated, obliterating the pouch which naturally exists between the testis and epididymis. Or, the testicle may be separated from the back part of the sac by an increase of this pouch, which forms a second sac communicating with the general sac of the tunica vaginalis, between the testis and epididymis. Lastly, the testis may occasionally project into, and transversely across, the hydrocelic cavity; forming a septum whereby the sac is divided into two compartments. The position of the testis is sometimes changed to the lower and fore part of the sac, or it may he wholly in front. The serous fluid is simply the natural secretion of the tunica vaginalis, or slightly modified by inflammation.

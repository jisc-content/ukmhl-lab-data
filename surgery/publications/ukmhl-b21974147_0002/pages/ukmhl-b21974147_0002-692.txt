6G4 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SUEGERY. Hereditary transmission is evinced in tlie gouty diathesis, and thence the production of lithic acid calculi. Sea; undoubtedly affects the relative proportion; stone is less frequent in females than males, in the ratio of 1 to 20, or 1 to 23. This remarkable disproportion is attributed mainly to the peculiar anatomical disposition of the female urethra; its comparative short- ness, larger size, dilatability, and straight course, all these circum- stances facilitating the passage of a small stone. Period of Life or Ageâ€”Stone may occur at any age, and accordmg to Stahl and Geyer, it occasionally exists as an intra-uterine affection. But the two extremes of life seem to be most subject; stone being met with most frequently, it is said, in young and in old people. Of 5376 cases collected by Civiale, 1946 occurred before the age of 10 years, 943 from 10 to 20, 460 from 20 to 30, 330 from 30 to 40, 391 from 40 to 50, 513 from 50 to 60, 577 from 60 to 70, 199 from 70 to 80, and 17 after 80 years of age. Coulson has collected 3264 cases of lithotomy ; under 20 years of age, the proportion was 71-20 per cent.; between 21 and 40 years, 12-10 per cent.; between 41 and 60, 10-87 per cent.; and between 61 and 80, 5-72 per cent. Sir H. Thompson's table com- prises 1827 cases ; under 20 years of age, 60-42 per cent. ; between 21 and 40 lO'lS per cent.; between 41 and 60, 17-56 per cent ; and betweeA 61 and 81, 11-83 per cent. Respecting the value of these statistics, Mr. Coulson has well remarked that they represent the absolute number of persons affected with stone, at different ages; but not as relative to the total number of persons hvmg, at the several periods of life. Thus, if all persons under 20 years were affected with a certain disease, and all persons over 70 years were affected with the same disease, the liability would be the same, although the absolute number of persons attacked would be very different By correcting this error between absolute and relative numbers, the tables would show that children and young persons are less liable, to calculous disorders than is commonly supposed; that from 20 years upwards, the tendency goes on increasing in a very remarkable manner to the end of life Sir H. Thompson thus expresses it: " that the proportion of elderly calculous patients to the existing population at their own ages, is larger than the proportion of children affected is to the number of existing children."

AMPUTATIONS OF THE FOOT. 117 Amputation at the Ankle-joint—%me's Operation.—This ampu- fation consists in making a posterior heel-flap, and an anterior incision across the joint; disarticulating the foot, and taking a slice off the end of the tibia. The foot projecting over the end of a table, and at a rio-ht ancrle to the leg, a stout bistoury is entered at the centre of one malleolus, and drawn downwards and slightly backwards, under the prominence of the heel (see Fig. 561,) upwards and forwards to a corresponding point at the other malleolus. (Fig. 566.) Or, the heel- incision may be carried slightly forwards. The flap, marked out bv this incision, is dissected back to the tendo-AchiUis; the opera- tor placing his fingers upon the heel, wkile his thumb rests upon Fig. 566. Fi&. 567. the edge of the flap, he cuts between the nail of the thumb and the tuberosity of the os calcis, pressing back steadily at the same time. In reflect- ing the integument round the tuberosity, the risk of making a button-hole will thus be avoided; and by still keeping the knife close to the bone on the inner side of the os calcis, the plantar arteries are not injured. (Fig. 567.) An incision is next made from one upper extremity of the heel-flap, across the dorsum of the foot, to the other extremity; then, depressing the foot, the joint is opened and the lateral ligaments divided by the point of the knife ; Fig. 568. Fig. 569-. the astragalus is disarticulated and the tendo-Achillis divided, as also any slight connection of the os calcis, and the foot removed. (Fig, 568.)

Ihe position of vessels around the crural ring is specially im portant with reference to the direction in which the stricture of femoral hernia at that aperture may be most safely divided. Commonly the ring IS partially surrounded by vessels; on the outer side, by the femoral vein, and at the upper angle by the epigastric artery; anteriorly, the pubic branch of the epigastric runs to the back of the pubes, and more removed from the aperture lie the spermatic vessels of the cord. Ihus, then, the ring is encircled by vessels, excepting internaUy and posteriorly An abnormal ongm of the obturator artery may, however give an additional vascular relation to the ring. Sometimes this artery Fig. 808.* (deep) epigastric, and in its course to the notch in the obtura- tor foramen, it may have either of two posi- tions relative to the crural ring; passing down more frequently on the outer side,! or arching over and down on the inner side (Fig. 808), at the base of Gimbernat's liga- ment, an occasional course which occurs once in about eighty operations (Lawrence). In the one position, the inner side of the ring , ^ , . -, , ^*ill *^e^ from any vessel; in the other, it is then completely encircled with vessels, except posteriorly in its relation to the pubes. The small pubic branch from the epigastric, which runs to the back ot the pubes, may perhaps pass downwards near the inner side of the crural ring to anastomose with the branch from the opposite side • or a similar branch, descending on the inner side of the crural ring may ]om the trunk of the obdurator (Fig. 809); or again, the epigastricartery, * Boy.

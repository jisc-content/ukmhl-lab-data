307 DISEASES IN DEVELOPMENT OF TEETH. growtt of the jaw, but it must be at once faced and obviated hr other measures. A disproportion between the size of the teeth and of the jaws (due rather to deficient growth of the latter than to excessive size of the former) is exceedingly common at the present day thouo-h it is and was all but unknown amongst rude races. In rickety persons the disproportion is even more marked, for the teeth have not par- ticipated at all m that stunting which has marred the development of the jaws, in common with the rest of the facial bones ; and consequentlv in extreme cases, the teeth have been seen arranged in a fan-like Fig. 683. shape, their crowns forming a circle of far larger radius than their roots. And it must not for a moment be forgotten that the permanent teeth, during their development, occupy positions which might be termed irregular; that IS to say. they overlap one another some- what, and the canines stand quite above (or below, as the case may be) the line of the others. (Fig. 683.) When they first appear through the gum they may retain : something of this normal irregu- _ : larity of position, which, unless there is something to interfere-such . as overcrowding, the retention of unabsorbed roots°of temTorrrv teeth c caUe^d^'of i'n"''' ^^^7 °f t^eth, just at the moment when it is rtt on of ? ? ^T.*' ""'"'''^^y subsequent cor! rection of an irregularity by the tedious process of wearino- plates in the mouth; and as it may chance that the operation may be'cffd for where the services of a dentist cannot be commanded, I few ' rpaJhJlu\toVSt\T r""^^^ ^ ""^^^'^ '^^^i^ris lj'arwus,iall upon the defective one; and in connection with th^« if teeth The tT'^ remembered that! of aU the iithJtf '■^T^^'l °* P<^™anent molars at an early ao-e (i e nn in leave any c^owdint' n L .1.

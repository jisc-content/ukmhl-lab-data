By placing the thumb on the tip of the nose, and upturning it slightly, the alas are expanded; and thus the more superficial part of the interior can be brought into view, aided by a httle motion of the nose from side to side, as one nostril or the other is inspected. Various expanding instruments have been devised for deeper examination. Dr. Thudichum's expanding forceps, or Frankel's instrument, may be introduced; both of these having the advantage of being self-retentive. Dr. Metz's two-bladed speculum admits also of dilatation; while for examining one side of the nose, Mr. Spencer Watson's single-bladed, concave speculum affords a free and illumined view. No expanding instruments should be introduced beyond the cartilaginous boundary of the outer portion of the nose, the only part which can be dilated; and in passing beyond with a speculum, care must be observed, and especially as the vascular mucous membrane is apt to bleed and obscure the view. To remove any dis- charge or encrusted mucus, the act of blowing the nose may prove sufficient; or it may be requisite to inject tepid water, by means of a Fia. 666. syringe, or by passing a stream through the nasal-syphon douche. (Pig. 666.) A bleeding ulcerated surface should be cleansed with cold water, or a weak solution of alum or other astringent. The syphon-tube consists of vulcanized india-rubber; the nostril end is provided with lateral apertures, and should fit the nostril. The other end of the tube is placed in a jug of water, elevated above the patient's head, at a height according to the force of the current required. Then, the water having been sucked into the nozzle, this end is inserted into the nostril; when, if the patient breathe entirely through his mouth, the current of water will pass through the nasal fossa, and return on the other side of the septum narium, thence escaping out of

SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. G72 to the toiicli. A proportionately smaller instrument, and with an abrupt curve, will be suitable for children, in whom the bladder is situated higher up in the pelvis than in adults. Sounds of various sizes and curvature will be required in different cases. Sounding is performed in the following manner:—The bladder containing three or four ounces of urine, or having been distended to that amount by injection with warm water, and the patient lying in the semi-recumbent position, the instrument is warmed conveniently by slipping it up the arm of the operator for a few seconds, then well oiled, and passed gently along the urethra into the bladder. Its cavity is explored—first, along the inferior surface, by raising the handle of the sound and passing its convexity from the neck of the bladder in a sweep backwards (Fig. Fig. 873. 87S); then, the bladder should be explored laterally, by revolving the handle from side to side between the fingers and thumb; lastly, the instrument should be withdrawn to the neck of the bladder, and the point turned downwards to the depressed space behind the prostate, and then upwards to behind the pubes. The space behind the prostate may sometimes be advan- tageously tilted forwards by introducing the finger into the rectum ; a proceeding chiefly requisite in old persons. _ In all these manoeuvres, the instrument is used with a gently tapping motion, in order to strike the stone. Failing to discover a stone in the recumbent position, the bladder should be sounded with the patient standing up, and with a more or less than moderately distended state of the cavity. These resources having failed to pre- sent the stone, a second exploration may be made m the coui-se of a ^^"^The knowledge gained by sounding comprises more than the fact of the presence of a stone. Its situation is generally found to be on one side of the neck of the bladder, more frequently to the right; or when small-sized it usually lies backwards towards the fundus or buried m the pace behinTthe^prostate.

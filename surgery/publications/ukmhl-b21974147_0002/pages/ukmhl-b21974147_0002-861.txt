TUMOUKS, AND CANCER, OF THE TESTICLE. 833 will necessarily be of a doubtful character, even when examined by an exploratoi'y puncture. Castration reveals the nature of the case, while it affords the only remedy. Fibrous Tumour of the Testicle is generally enumerated among the Tumours to which this organ is liable. An apparently well- marked specimen is described by Cruveilhier. Its consistence was very firm, and it creaked under the scalpel; the weight of the tumour was heavy in comparison with its size, which was twice that of the natural size of the testicle. In point of structure, when examined it was found to consist of contorted and interlaced greyish-white fibres forming lobules, with vessels penetrating their interspaces ; thus cer- tainly confirming the nature of this tumour. Sir B. Brodie describes a less well-marked specimen, which he removed by castration. Sir James Paget speaks of a " fibro-cellular tumour," removed in like manner by Mr. John Lawrence; and which was so succulent that, in its consistence, it resembled a fatty tumour. Sig7is.—The enlarged testicle has a uniform shape, and the tumour is very hard and heavy, painless, and of slow growth. Castration is not followed by recurrence of the growth Cartilaginous Tumour op the Testicle is sufficiently noticed in connection with Cystic Tumour. These two forms of growth are so very frequently associated in the same Tumour, that the pathology and treatment of Enchondroma of the Testicle, as an independent form of Tumour, need not be considered separately.

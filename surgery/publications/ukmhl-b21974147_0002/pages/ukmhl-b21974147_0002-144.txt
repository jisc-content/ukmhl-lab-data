116 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. Fig. 562. a3 mucli of the foot as may be consistent witli the removal of the diseased or injured portion beyond recovery, and the formation of sound covering; and among many illustrations of this principle I can give no better example than the useful foot remaining after I had removed all the toes between the great and little toe, at their tarsal articulations, in a case of crushing violence. (Fig. 563 ) Amputation through the Tarsus—medio-tarsal— in the line of articulation between the astragalus and OS calcis, posteriorly, and the scaphoid and cuboid bones, anteiiorly.—Ghoparfs Operation.— The guides to this operation are the tubercle of the scaphoid bone on the inner side of the foot, and a point about half an inch behind the tubercle of the fifth metatarsal bone on the Fia. 563. Fig. 564. Fig. 565.* outer side of the foot, or about midway between this projection and the front of the outer malleolus. The operation is similar to Hey's, only that the incisions are commenced further back ; the dorsal curved incision is made between the points of bone above named ; the tarsal bones must then be disarticulated, and the plantar flap formed, keeping the knife well turned towards the under concave surface of the metatarsal bones, and extending this flap forwards to the root of the toes, where it should be rounded off across the sole of the foot. (Fig. 564.) The vessels are thus left uninjured, and an ample cushion formed. The head of the astralagus had better be sawn off; and the tendo- Achillis, which is apt to tilt this bone forward, may be divided by subcutaneous section at the time of the operation, or subsequently. The stump, as compared with that made by Hey's amputation, is here represented in section. (Fig. 565.) * Roy. Coll. Surg. Mus., 2817c. Stump after Chopart's amputation—lucdio- tarsal. iScction.

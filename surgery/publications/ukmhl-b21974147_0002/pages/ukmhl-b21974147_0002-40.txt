12 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SUBGERY. and such comparison must have reference to the five essential par- ticulars already mentioned (p. 8), and to the mortality. The following general results of excision and their relation to con- ditions of disease of the joints, as illustrated by my own series of cases, may be here noted :— (1.) Excision proved successful by one operation, in 21 out of 25 cases of the knee, hip, and elbow joints. (2.) Of the 4 unsuccessful cases by one operation, 3 were cases of scrofulous disease, and of the knee-joint in a total of 12 cases; the remaining 1 being chronic synovitis, and of the elbow-joint in a total of 5 cases. (3.) Re-excision was resorted to in 2 of the 4 cases; 1 knee-joint, and 1 elbow-joint, the latter with a successful result. (4.) Secondary ariyputation in 3 of the 4 cases. All 3 were knee-joint cases, and subjects of scrofulous disease; 1 had been subjected to re- excision. The 3 amputations made rapid recoveries. These results tend to show that if the attempt to preserve a limb by previous ex- cision, and even by re-excision of a large joint as the knee, should fail, the operation is not prejudicial to secondary amputatian for the preser- vation of life. (5.) 0-ne death only in the 25- cases, of the knee, hip, or elbow joints, whatever had been the candition of disease, subject to the principles of selection laid down; or whatever the operation—excision, re-excision, or secondary amputation. The fatal case was after excision of the knee-joint; and tho cause of death—acute tetanus. Fig. 470.* Fig. iSO-.f Special Excisional Surgery of the Joints'fok Disease.—Thb * Eoyal Free TTospital.

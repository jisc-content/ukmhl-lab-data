And, not unfrequently strangulation occurs on the occasion of the first descent; in femora more often than inguinal hernia. The duration of strangulation, before reduction or operation, has also been shown by Mr. Bryant to vary considerably, and in the two common forms of hernia; that the minimum period of strangulation is usually eight hours, and the maximum fourteen days; and that the average period of strangulation for inguinal hernia is 50^ hours, for femoral hernia 76^ hours. These facts throw light on the>obabiKty ot a tatal result, consequent on the delay of reduction, and also after opGrSjtion • Treatment—The indication is the removal of the constriction from the strangulated hernial tumour. This may be accomplished by gentle reduction of the hernial contents through the stricture; or, failing thus to fulfil the indication, then an operative proceeding for

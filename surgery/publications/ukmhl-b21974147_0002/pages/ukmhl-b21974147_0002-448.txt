HPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 420 rare occurrence. (Fig. 756.) Both these spinal curvatures appear to be simply an enlargement of the natural curvatures existing in their respective regions; they thus differ from angular curvature, and also in being unconnected with caries or other disease of the spine. Lor- dosis, to a limited degree, may also occur in the dorsal region, as a compensatory incurvation to angular curvature in the cervical or lower dorsal region, resulting from caries; or dorsal lordosis is some- times associated with double lateral curvature, the vertebral column arching forwards as well as sideways. In the cervical region, lordosis to some extent accompanies caries of the first two vertebrse, a compen- satory incurvation taking place in the neck below. Fig. 756. Causes.—Cyphosis results from weakness of the dorsal muscles, whereby posterior curvature takes place in the dorsal region. Henoe the influence of occupations in the stooping position, as gardening, or driving on the box of a carriage or coach; and the predisposition which arises from age—an early or advanced period of life.

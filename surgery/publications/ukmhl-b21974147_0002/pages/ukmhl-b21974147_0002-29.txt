THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF SURGERY. CHAPTER XXXIX * EXCISIONAL SURQERT OF THE JOINTS AND BONES. The Joints, fob Disease. The Operations of Surgery are generally of two kinds: those wliicli consist in the removal of some part of the body, whether by Excision or Amputation; and those which effect the restoration of parts de- stroyed by disease or injury, or wanting by congenital defect, consti- tuting Plastic Surgery. The latter class of Surgical Operations is responsive to the guiding principle of restoring the body to its healthy integrity of structure and function. So also, in the removal of any portion of the organism, similar considerations — anatomical and physiological—should ever be observed, with a view to the maintenance of that integrity as far as possible. But the removal of any part will be a resource in the hands of the true Surgeon only under patho- logical conditions justifying such interferepce, lest a surgical operation of unavoidable sacrifice become another name for reckless mutilation. Taking the conditions, local and constitutional, which may be appropriate for the operations of Excision, in connection with their performance and after-treatment, we comprehend the full import of the expression " Excisional Surgery," as distinguished from a descrip- faon merely of the operative procedures. Viewed in the latter sense only, liixcision or Ee-section, as it is sometimes less properly named, signifies the removal of any part of the body, by a cutting-out operation of extir- pation. This kind of operation relates chiefly to the joints and bones, although It may be practised also for the removal of tumours, as adventitious growths produced in connection with the natural or- ganism.

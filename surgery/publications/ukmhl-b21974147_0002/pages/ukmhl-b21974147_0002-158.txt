130 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. taken as the line of incision, otherwise no skin could have heen obtained to cover the stump, and a kind of oval amputation was per- formed as follows:—Entering the knife just below the middle of Poupart's ligament, it was then drawn obliquely downwards and in- wards, crossing the back of the thigh, and prolonged upwards and inwards to the point of its departure; in this way an oval flap was made from the integuments of the back of the thigh and buttock. The muscles were then divided, the femoral artery secured, and the head of the femur turned out of the socket. Although little hsemor- rhage resulted from the operation, the patient towards its end showed symptoms of severe collapse. On being placed in bed, he recovered from chloroform, but expired within three hours of the operation. Besults.—Am^ui&tion at the hip-joint is an operation of fatal result in the great majority of cases ; in 126 cases, 76 having died. But the mortality difiers considerably according to whether the operation be performed for disease or injury. Thus, in 9 cases by Mr. Spence, of ^ for disease, 2 died; but of the 5 for injury, 4 died. In 42 hip-joint amputations for chronic disease of the femur, 18 died; whereas, m 47 for injury, 35 were fatal; and the death-rate percentage was 85 durmg the American War. Primary amputation for injury is the most fatal; in 30 cases, collected by Legouest, all died; and in another 12, during the Crimean War, all died. In the American War, however, of 19 cases, 2 recovered. Secondary amputation for severe injury to the femur has been far more successful; of 9 cases in America, 2 re- covered ; and in 4 cases, by J. Roux, during the French campaign of 1859 in Italy, all recovered. Re-amputation at the hip-joint, for diseased thigh-stumps, has proved successful in 4 out of 7 American cases. CHAPTER XLI.* DISEASES OF THE SKIN. The skin illustrates in a pre-eminent degree the f ^^^^^g^ °^ ^^^^^^f^^ in general.

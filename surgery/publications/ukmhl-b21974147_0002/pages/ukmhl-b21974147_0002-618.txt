The Sur Jon sitting opposite the perineum, he freely pares the margin of^the openmg; then, the edges are brought into even and easy apposition transversely to the axis of the vagina; to effect which it will be neces- sary to divide the sphincter ani on either side, in order to overcome tension and spasmodic muscular contraction after the operation The sides of the opemng are evenly secured in apposition by means of silver or platinum wire sutures ; taking care to transfix the whole thickness of the gut, excluding its mucous membrane, and observing to bring the sutures through the vaginal mucous membrane half aS inch beyond the pared edges, above and below. The suture-wires are faxed by a close twist of the wire across the line of aperture, or thev mav be passed through a perforated leaden shield, overlying the aperture then through split shot, which are clamped with forceps close upon the shield, so as to fix it upon the vaginal wall. The ends of wire are snipped, and the operation completed. 4/-ier-treatment is most im- portant It consists m preventing any action of the bowels for a week or ten days, by keeping the patient under the influence of opium until firm union is established. A laxative aperient, or an enema of castor oil and gruel may then be administered. Cleanliness is also essential to success; the vagina being syringed with cold water two or three times a day, and the urine drawn off by a catheter as occasion requires About the end of a week, the sutures may be snipped through and gently withdrawn. A small aperture, even a pin-hole opening not unfrequently remains, and obstinately resists closure. This must be treated, as already described, by touching with nitrate of silver or the wire-cautery. In one such case—after the usual operative procedure I applied the actual cautery on seven different occasions, before I suc- ceeded in closing the pin-hole aperture. The complication of a Lacerated Perinewm must be treated by the appropriate operation, described in connection with that condition • the fistulous aperture being closed by paring, and sutures. I have thus closed a recto-vaginal fistula, and subsequently a laceration of the perineum, which existed in the same woman; and in whom also a tight annular membranous stricture of the rectum was cured, by dividing its free margin with scissors, at two or three points of its circumference, and which I then dilated as usual, by the occasional passage of a bougie.

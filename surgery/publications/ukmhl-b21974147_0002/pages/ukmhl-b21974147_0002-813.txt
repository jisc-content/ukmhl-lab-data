785 RETENTION OF URINE. allowed to remain for a few days, until urine flows by tte natural channel, or until stricture of the urethra or other obstruction Las been ovei'come. The value of puncture by the rectum Has been variously estimated. Mr. Cock, who has performed this operation in a large number of cases, is led to very favourable conclusions respecting It : that it is more easy of performance, and less dangerous in its results, than any mode of entering the bladder for the relief of retention. The objections made to the operation are not so much the liability of perforating the peritoneum or seminal vesicles, both of which parts may, with care in performing the operation, be avoided ; but the liability to urinary in- filtration, pelvic inflammation and abscess between the rectum and bladder, and a per.sistent fistulous opening. In one singular case that Mr. Enchsen relates, rectal flatus became diffused through the cellular tissue of the pelvis and down the thighs and nates ; an emphysematous condition from which the patient died. _ Puncture through the rectum should be resorted to only when with retention from stricture, there is no sign of abscess or extravasa- FiG. 927* Fig. 928.t tion in the perineum ; the urethra is apparently not dilated behind the stricture, nor the prostate much enlarged (Fi^s 907 79S^ a ^ catheter cannot be passed, under chloroform wfth tr^ anP^atience' blL l ^^^%7/^^Pl^°f^°^' abscess may have formed between the I bladder and the rectum; or a cyst in this situation has been known tn . cause symptoms of retention, unreheved by pnncture per rectum the ttrocar having entered only the cavity of the cyst. ^^9^ )^'}!^.

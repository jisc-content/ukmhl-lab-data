SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 62 Fig. 512.* fossa; and below, just bonoath the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, including tho head of the radius at that line. Any surrounding (mt- <irowLh oE bone, resulting from exuberant reparative action, must not be mistaken for disease; it should not be included in the excision. Bni any thickened synovial membrane may bo dissected out. The line of incision having been closed with sutures, the arm is placed semiflexed on an angular splint (Fig. 512); or it may be simply laid upon a pillow, with a sand-bag on either side of the forearm, just to steady the part. This plan of after- treatment, without any splint, was, I believe, first tried in my own practice. It offers the advantage of being at- tended with less swelling and tension around the elbow, than when a splint is used, with an interrupted band- age ; and union, therefore, progresses more favourably. To insure the formation of fibrous or flexible union only, passive motion should be gradu- ally commenced when such reparation is established; say, in three or four weeks. Results of Excision of Elbow-joint. —(1.) In relation to Life, or the Mortalify.—Three general conclusions may be drawn from the results of one large collection of cases; those in the Hospitals of the United Kingdom, and the practice of individual Surgeons. (1.) A less mor- tality than that of any joint-excision in the lower extremity; and in the upper extremity also, so far as statistics hitherto collected supply the data for comparison. (2.) An average mortality of 1 in 8, or 12 per cent.; or even much lower,—about 1 in 15, or about 7 per cent. (3.) A very different mortality in tho hands of individual Surgeons. The collection of cases, by Dr. Hodges, amounts to 119; of these, 15 died, 1 in 8, or 12 per cent. Autlvor's Collection. (1.) Eoyal Infirmary, EdinburRli; period. 18G5-69. (Per Mr. P. H. Watson.)

AMPUTATION OF THE ARM. Ill Fig. 552. artery, the Surgeon makes a couple of equal flaps, an anterior and a posterior; simply by transfixing the arm in front of the humerus, and cutting a well-rounded flap, and then enter- ing the knife behind the bone and making Mother such flap. (Fig. 652.) These are retracted by an assistant. A sweep of the knife clears the bone, which is then sawn through; care having been taken that the 7nusculo-spiral nerve was divided at the back of the bone—if the amputation be at that part of the arm where this nerve winds round behind the humerus. The artery and any bleeding branches of magnitude are secured, and the flaps brought together with sutures. Circular amputation, as in the thigh, will be preferable, if the limb be very fleshy. Amputation by a long external, and a .• sliort internal, rectangular flap, on Teale's principle, may be practised • with advantage occasionally. This method is suitable where sufiicient i flaps cannot otherwise be obtained, more often from wasting or con- densation of the muscles, in disease of the forearm.

'For disease, as of the joints or bones, amputation is espe- cially successful; but far less so for malignant disease. For injury, the' operation in either part is generally r more fatal. The death-rate per cent, rises, as usual, relatively to ampu- t tation nearest the trunk. During the American War, the proportion »was, after amputation of the forearm, 16'5; the arm, 21. In the

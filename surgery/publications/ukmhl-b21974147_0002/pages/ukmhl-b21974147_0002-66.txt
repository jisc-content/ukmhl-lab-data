Of these two modes of after-treatment I prefer the former, especially for the joint-operation. The section end of the femur is drawn Fig. 497.* Fig. 498.* Fig. 499.* up by muscular action, and hitches just above the acetabulum, which having been, generally, more or less superficially carious, is thus left to re- cover itself, undisturbed by any attri- tion of the femoral end of bone; while a new, and firmly fibrous, movable joint forms, where the end of bone I'ests above the acetabulum. (Fig. 497.) In the case from which this specimen was taken, I had operated ten months previously, and although the patient died from pelvic- abscess, with caries on the inner surface of the iliac bone, a perfect ball-and-socket joint had formed, with capsule, above the acetabulum, which was be- coming obliterated. The anterior portion of the capsule is removed to show the new articu- lation of the bones. There is little or no ten- dency to displacement after hip-joint excision, and the slight extra shortening which results from thus leaving the limb to itself (Fig. 498) is unimportant compared with the advantages in regard to the acetabulum, and the formation of the best kind of new-joint requisite for the functional use of the limb, in progression, as well as for support. The annexed figure, drawn from one of my cases, represents this result; and which has now been of several years' duration, the little girl having grown to a young woman.

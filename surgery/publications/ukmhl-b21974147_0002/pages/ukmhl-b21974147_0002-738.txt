710 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. paction of fragments, even of some size. Small and soft stones are most suitable for the operation; and it has been practised occasionally and with success, by Civiale, Fergusson, and other Surgeons, both in male and female children. But the great success of lithotomy in young subjects has brought that operation into far more established repute. Results of LitJiotrity, and as compared with Lithotomy.—Unquestion- ably the accumulating results of experience in lithotrity lead to the conclusion that a far larger proportion of cases can fairly be submitted to this method of treatment than was formerly supposed, instead of to lithotomy. When first practised in this country, the results of Sir B. Brodie's 115 cases showed a mortality of somewhat less than 1 in 12^; whereas the mortality of lithotomy is about 1 in 7, or even as high as 1 in 4|. Civiale's cases of lithotrity in one year—1862—amounted to 45, about his annual average. Of these, 8 were partially cured; and the operation was successful in all the remaining 37 but 1. The same distinguished lithotritist states that his total mortality in 591 opera- tions was 14 deaths, or only 1 in 42-21. But this general result has been much criticized. Sir H. Thompson's cases having been more clearly recorded (" Med. Chir-Trans.," 1870), they afford trustworthy evidence of the relative mortality. Out of 184 consecutive cases of lithotrity in the adult, the deaths, reckoning every kind of casualty following the operation, were 12 ; but, omitting 5 cases resulting from previous disease of the bladder or kidneys, and thus leaving 7 deaths from operation, the mortality is reduced to only 4 per cent. Taking, however, the total of 500 cases of operation for stone in the bladder of the adult male,—as including the entire experience of the same operator up to January, 1877, we have the following results :—in 422 cases of lithotrity, 32 deaths, or 1 in 13 ; 78 cases of lithotomy, 29 deaths, or 1 in 2f cases; in total 500 cases, 61 deaths, or 1 in 8| cases. The mortality of 122 cases of lithotrity in the hands of Mr. Crichton is about the same; being only 8 deaths, or less than 1 in 15. Sir W. Fergusson's experience comprises 271 cases of stone, of which number 217 were in adults; 110 were submitted to lithotomy, with a mortality of 33; whereas of 109 treated by lithotrity, only 12 died. Mr. Charles Hawkins has collected the results of all the cases of stone in the bladder admitted into the London Hospitals (excepting the Hospital for Stone), in the years 1862-63. The total number of patients was 177, comprising 86 children and 91 adults ; of the whole number it would appear that only 32 were treated by lithotrity, while 139 underwent lithotomy—the remaining 6 cases not having been sub- mitted to either operation. Considering the relative mortality of the two operations—so highly in favour of lithotrity—the small proportion of cases submitted to this operation would not seem judicious. At the Royal Free Hospital, it is true, the seven cases of stone in the two years all underwent lithotomy; but, then, they wei-e all cases in children. Selection of Operation—Lithotomy oe Lithotrity.—The practical importance of a judicious selection of cases for either operation is well enforced by Civiale's statistical results. Thus,—in a total number of 838 cases of stone in the bladder, during a period of twenty yeai"S,— of the last 332 cases, 241 were lithotritized, leaving 91 which were con- sidered unfit for that operation. Of the 91 cases, 28 were lithotomized, and in 8 others the two operations were combined; making a total of

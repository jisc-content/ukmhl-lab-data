121 AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. six cases, one death ensued. Respecting the comparative mortality of Syme's and Pirogoff's methods of amputation, and the results of sub- astrao'aloid amputation, see Excisions. After any of these amputations at or immediately below the ankle- joint, an artificial foot may be adapted. A common and cheap form is Fig. 575. Fig. 576. a leathern hood, not unlike an elephant's foot (Pig. 575); or Bigg's artificial foot will be a complete apparatus. (Fig. 576.) Amputation op the Leg.—An assistant commands the femoral artery by digital pressure or compression with a tourniquet, and the leg, projecting beyond the edge of a table, should be held horizontally by another assistant seated on a low chair or stool. The Surgeon, standing as usual so as to grasp the limb below the seat of ampu- tation, enters the point of the knife at the posterior edge of the tibia— on the left leg—carries it downwards on the bone for about an inch and a half, curves the incision across the anterior aspect of the leg to the posterior margin of the fibula, and up that bone 577. to the point opposite its ""/Vv commencement on the tibial side. (Fig. 577.) The flap is reflected by a few touches with the point of the knife, which is then made to transfix the limb behind the bones from one horn of the anterior flap to the other—care being taken not to lock the instrument batween the bones—and by cutting obliquely downwards and backwards, a long posterior flap is formed. The inter- osseous membrane is divided transversely, with the point of the knife, and a sweep round the bones clears a line for the saw. In applying the saw, the fibula should be divided first; otherwise, as a slender long bone, it will be splintered ; and the tibia had better be sawn obliquely from before backwards, to make the anterior flap lay more easily than it would on the sharp ridge of a transverse section of the bone. Any projecting spiculous portion 9f bone must be clipped off with cutting-

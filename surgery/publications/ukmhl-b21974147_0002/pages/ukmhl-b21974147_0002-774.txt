Perhaps a deposit of urates and uric acid takes place m connection with a gouty diathesis. The quantity of urine passed varies much from day to day ; the measure being generally mucJi above, although sometimes below, the average healthy standard ihe patients general health declines during the course of his habitual retention, and inflammatory affection of the bladder. As the result of broken rest, from ineffectually reheving the bladder, and constitutional disturbance owing to the state of the organ, he becomes sallow and dejected, he loses flesh and strength, and "ages" fast. Occasional attacks of complete retention throw him further back. A gradual decLme ot health takes place; or ra'pid depression, from ulceration or sloughing of the bladder, with repeated hemorrhage, or from profuse purulent discharge. Urcemia, from suppression of urine, sometimes closes the scene. Post-mortem Examination.—Certain pathological conditions of the bladder ureters, and kidneys result from the mechanical and back- Avard efl:ect of long-continued retention of urine. They are discovered aj-ter death. The Madder is thickened, principally in its muscular coat, and its hypertrophied muscular bands project inwards in the torm oif prominent fasciculi; between which the mucous membrane protrudes externally, and has become sacculated under the constant pressure of the retained urine. At the base of the bladder, a pouch or receptacle has formed behind the enlarged prostate, capable of holding perhaps several ounces of the ammoniacal, foetid urine; and m which mucus and phosphatic concretion-matter are also apt to accumulate. The backward pressure of urine distends, and eventually dilates the ureters; and the secreting substance of the kidneys, in their pyramidal and cortical portions, are atrophied; resulting even m sacculated remnant kidneys. Hence, suppression of urine, and urasmic blood-poisoning. Treatment.—Palliative measures alone have any efPect in chronic enlargement of the prostate ; and they relate to the relief of retention by catheterism or other operative interference, the prevention or relief of chronic cystitis, and the maintenance of the general health. Retention of Urine.—Having regard to the constant retention of a certain quantity of residual urine in the bladder, the organ should-be emptied mechanically, at least once a day, or twice or three times; according to the amount of obstruction, and the consequent accumula- ^ tion of residual urine. The prostatic catheter is larger sized, longer, and more curved than an ordinary catheter; and thus being adapted to the corresponding alterations in the urethra, the urine can be more conveniently drawn off by this instrument. Two points should be observed in passing the instrument into the bladder : not to mistake the dilatation of the prostatic urethra for the bladder, an ounce of i

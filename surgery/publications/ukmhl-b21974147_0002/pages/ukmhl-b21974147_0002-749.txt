TUMOURS OF THK BLADDER. 721 cenh'ated decoction of pareira with diluted nitro-rauriatic acid in ten or fifteen minim doses. The acid is more suitable when the urine is itself alkaline, than when it subsequently becomes so by admixture with alkaline mucus in the bladder. Benzoic acid*also renders alkaline . urine acid, and I have found gallic acid useful in arresting the secretion of ropy mucus. Injections are highly serviceable, when no acute symp- toms are present. They may be sedative, as decoction of popj)ies, in quantities of not more than two ounces, and retained for half a minute once a day ; or astringent injections, as diluted nitric acid, ten minims gradually increased to twenty in two ounces of water, and allowed to remain for a few minutes. Sir H. Thompson speaks highly of the acetate of lead, beginning with one-sixth of a grain to the ounce of distilled water; and next to this agent, the nitrate of silver, com- mencing with one grain to eight ounces of water, gradually increased up to one grain to the ounce of diluent. Carbolic acid, in the pro- portion of only two or three drops to half a pint of water, as an injection, is said to have a corrective influence on the urine, when foetid. But I prefer to remove the muco-purulent secretion, as it collects from time to time, by simply washing out the bladder with tepid water, by means of the bladder-injecting syringe and large double-current catheter; throwing in the injection gently, and to not more than three or four ounces, over the interior of the sensitive and instable bladder. Then the free surface can be treated with a sedative or astringent solution, more efEecfcually. By these measures, coupled with tonics a,nd a generous diet, to support the dread exhaustion of chronic cystitis, we may succeed in arresting the progress of the disease to a fatal issue. In conjunction with this course of treatment the removal of any cause in operation must obviously be a primary consideration. Hence, the treatment for stone or other foreign body in the blad- der, or perchance a tumour in this organ; and the various causes of retention,— from stricture, enlarged prostate, or paralysis. Tumours of the Bladder.—These diseases comprise—(1) Fibrous growth, of a warty or of a polypoid character; (2) Villous or vascular growths; (3) Cancer; encephaloid, scirrhus, epithelial, colloid. Fibrous groivth springs from the mu- cous membrane and submucous tissue, and consists of their elemental structures. It commences in the form of a circumscribed elevation of the mucous membrane, resembling a warty growth and sub- sequently enlarges, protrudes, and assumes a polypoid iovm (Fig 894 ) * Roy. Coll.

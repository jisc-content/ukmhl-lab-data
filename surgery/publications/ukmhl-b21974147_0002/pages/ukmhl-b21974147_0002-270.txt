242 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. CHAPTER XLIV * AURAL SURGERY. In treating the subject of Aural Surgery in a work devoted to general practitioners and students, it has been the aim of the writer to give as concisely as possible only the leading principles for the diagnosis and treatment. This branch has been so highly developed by the work of Wilde, Toynbee, Gruber, Politzer, etc., that those who desire to make a special study of it have ample means of doing so. But every general practitioner should have at least sufficient knowledge of the subject to treat the more ordinary cases, and to detect those diseases which are beyond his management, and require the advice of a specialist, before irreparable mischief has taken place. With this object the affections which do not require much special training for diagnosis have been more fully dwelt upon. Malformations.—Congenital malformations of the ear are not unfre- quently met with. The auricle and meatus may be entirely absent, but are more frequently imperfectly developed; the former being deformed, or represented merely by a fold of integument, and the latter partially or entirely occluded. Sometimes there is a double set of organs; and in other cases, in which the auricle may be perfect, there Fig. 640.1 is no membrane,—the meatus being closed at the end by skm corre- spending to the cutaneous covering of the meatus, beneath which there is generally found sohd bone. The tympanic cavity and ossicles are, in most cases of malformation, only partially developed, while the laby- rinth is frequently normal; and, when this is the case, there is a * Bv William Laidlaw Purves. . . i • „ x„i,„„ „, t India-rubber bag used in Politzer's method of opening the Eustachian tubes, or ' for opening them through the catheter.

INJUBIES OF THE THORACIC PARIETES, AND ORGANS. 425 .prmd of some duration ; the patient may have walked- or run a con- a penod ot some ^^^^ ^^^^ twenty-nme cases, if^tpd Orvlr and Sanson, of penetrating wounds of the heart, ?olT-e i^^^^^^^^^ ^^^ore death ensued. But here the d.rect.on Ate wound, and the cavity of the organ injured, are very important l.nort°rconsiderations, when any such particulars can be ascer- FTld durin- life from the mode in which the injiiry was inflicted. Sus a wou^d ia the direction of the axis of the heart is not so speedily Thus, a wouna ^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^ is more im- Seltely faT^^^^^^^^^^ of the ventricle, this difference depending ^robablf on some obstruction to the free escape of blood by an irregular Entiction of the muscular fibres, owing to their structural arrange- ^en In the wall of the ventricle. In exceptional cases hfe may be Solonled for some days, or recovery has been known to occur, and ^ven although a foreign body remain lodged m the heart. In one lstance Fe?rus relates that a man lived twenty days with a skewer ransto^ the heart from side to side. In another case,_a boy lived fivTweeks with a piece of wood, three inches long sticking into the rilt ventricle; as discovered after death by Messrs. Davis and Steward. A soldier, whose case Latour records, lived for six years after a wound in the right ventricle, from a musket-ball which re- mained lodged against the septum; and Carnochan relates t^at a man hved eleven days with a bullet deeply buried m the apex of the heart Bupture of the heart, without penetrating wound of the chest, is generally fatal almost instantly; but life may be prolonged for some hours, fourteen hours having elapsed after rupture of the right auricle, as recorded by Rust. . In two instances perhaps, and in one certainly, the chest has been completely transfixed, and yet the individuals recovered and lived tor vears afterwards. One such case happened in the person ol a sailor whose thorax, through the cardiac- region to the back, was transfixed by a trysail mast, an iron-pointed shaft, which fell on him from a height oi board ship, pinning him to the deck (1831). The shaft was with some difficulty extracted from the chest. I had an opportunity o± ex- amining this man many years afterwards, and he was then in good health and without any thoracic inconvenience. I communicated a report of the examination I made to the Lancet, about l«5y. in another and previous instance, transfixion of the chest (?) by the shaft of a chaise was followed by a recovery of eleven years duration. The original history of both these remarkable cases, with the instru- ments of penetration, is preserved in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. . Treaimerei.—A. penetrating wound of the chest presents certain gene- ral indications of treatment. (1.) Hemorrhage must be arrested. The wound may be accompanied with hemorrhage from two sources: the arteries of the parietes, or the vessels of the lungs. The former are less frequently the source of haemorrhage. An intercostal artery is seldom wounded, the vessel lying under cover apparently of the groove in the lower border of the upper rib of the two. Yet occasionally the artery bleeds freely, even to the amount of four pounds of blood, into the pleural cavity. The integumental wound must then be enlarged, if necessary, to reach the bleeding vessel, which may be secured by ligature or torsion. Compression may sometimes be more practicable ;

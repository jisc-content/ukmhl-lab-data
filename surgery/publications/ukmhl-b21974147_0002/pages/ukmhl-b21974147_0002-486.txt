The causes in question are rupture from contusion, and penetrating wounds ot the abdomen. Contusion is necessarily occasioned by severe external violence; the passage of a cart-wheel across the abdomen, or conapression between the buffers of two railway carriages, known as J3uffer-accidents; and in Military practice, the brushing action of a so-called wmd-contusion, or the direct pounding of a spent cannon-ball, itupture ot any one of the viscera, and extensive internal htemorrhage,

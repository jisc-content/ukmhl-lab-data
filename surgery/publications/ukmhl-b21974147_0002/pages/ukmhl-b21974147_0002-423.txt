CONCUSSION OF THE SPINAL COBD. 395 vention is nearly always possible. The nurse, if she understand her duty, or instructed by the Surgeon, will take every watchful precaution to avoid or remove any pressure upon prominent parts ; rememberino- the painless and insidious character of the ulceration in most cases' Hence, the importance of using a well-stuffed bed, so that the patient shall not sink into hollows, and of observing that the sheet be kept free from wrinkles. A draw-sheet placed under the buttocks is very serviceable m aid of cleanliness, and the nurse should always use a bed- pan, and take care that the fundament be sponged and wiped dry, after any evacuation. It will be necessary to employ a urine-bottle, in case of dribbhng micturition. The, patient should be thoroughly examined from time to time, to see that no bed-sore is threatening. Exposed : parts—the sacrum in particular—may be fortified by washing them with : some slightly stimulant lotion; such as spirits of wine, or with the addition of two grains of bichloride of mercury to the ounce—as Brodie recommended—or a Aveak carbolic acid solution ; or, the part 1 maybe mechanically protected with a layer of soap-plaster spread on : thick wash-leather, or with a pad of cotton-wadding. A proper adiust- : ment of rmg-cushions or air-pillows will further aid in removino- J pressure; and the water-bed is often a most useful resource. Any abrasion of the skm maybe painted over with collodion ; when slouffh- mg takes plape, separation of the dead textures should be promoted bv : poulticing with charcoal or carbolized charcoal; and, afterwards the clean ulcer may be dressed with a weak stimulant solution, as of perchloride of iron or tincture of myrrh. Care must still be taken to : guard against pressure. Throughout the treatment, whether pre- ventive or remedial, the patient's weak circulation and low nutrition :. must be invigorated, as far as possible, by tonics and nutritious food 'dPnnfpTr\°\?'

A pointed foreign body, as a fish-bone or a pm must be withdrawn very carefully, lest it lacerate the pharynx When any such body has been removed, a pricking sensation will stiU be experienced by the patient for a while. A digestible substance as a lump of meat, might be pushed down, through the oesophagus! into the stomach, by means of a sponge-headed probang with spring- expanding shaft, A B. (Fig. 708.) Low down in the'cBsophagus, L Fig. 708.

But a rough substance, which would thus rupture the oesophagus, or one of a metallic or other kind unsuited to the stomach, as a half-crown, had better be drawn up gi'adually by the hook-probang (Fig. 709) or by forceps. Sometimes, an emetic will succeed in dislodging and ejecting the substance; or it has been dis- solved, as in the case of a chicken-bone, by swallowing large quantities of dilute acid. This, however, is obviously an objectionable proceeding.

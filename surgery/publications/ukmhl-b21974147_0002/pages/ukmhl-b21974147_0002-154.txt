SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 126 retraction, the longer anterior flap will fold over the end of bone, and the cicatrix becomes posterior to the centre of the stump. Moreover, the higher section of the bone insures a deeper covering, as the flaps cannot retract beyond the line of their bases. The circular mode of amputation may be preferred, especially in a very muscular thigh (see p. 94). Amputation of the Thigh, hy Lateral Flaps.—Yermale^s Operation.— In the lower third of the thigh, amputation is best performed by lateral, instead of antero-posterior flaps; the sides of the thigh, in this part, being more fleshy, and better fitted for the formation of a stump. The Surgeon grasping the soft parts, on the outer side of the thigh, with his left hand, and drawing them outwards from the side of the femur, the knife is entered perpendicularly in the middle of the thigh, about three inches above the upper border of the patella, and thrust downwards close round Fig. 584. the bone, and brought out in the centre of the hani (Fig. 684); the flap then being cut downwards and outwards. The knife is again entered, at the upper angle of the incision, the thigh transfixed close to the side of the bone, and the point being brought out at the lower angle of the incision, a corresponding inner flap is made in like manner. Unless the blade be passed around the bone on this aspect of the thigh, the femoral artery is very apt to be split. The flaps are retracted, the bone cleared Fig. 585.

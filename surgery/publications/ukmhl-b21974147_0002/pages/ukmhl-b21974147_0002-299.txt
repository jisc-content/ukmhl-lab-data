DISEASES OF THE NASAL FOSSiE. 271 with an equal part of flour, forming a paste. Or the Vienna paste is a good preparation ; consisting of_ equal parts of quicklime and potassa cum calce, mixed up with spirits of wine. In using these powerful caustics, and particularly to such a part as the nose or cheek the sur- rounding skin must be protected by a piece of plaster, with a hole for the ulcer; and while the zinc paste may be allowed to do its work in the course of six or eight hours, the Vienna compound should be removed after ten or fifteen minutes, as it induces serious constitutional irritation. On removing the caustic, a poultice is applied. In the non- esedens and the erythematous forms of lupus, cauterization is equally necessary; but the destruction of tissue need not extend so deep. Hence, strong solutions of caustic potash will generally answer the purpose. Restoration of the lost portion of the nose or cheek forms part of ■ the Plastic Surgery of the Face. Bodent ulcer, as affecting the nose, is allied to Lupus exedens, or ; perhaps to Epithelial Cancer; and similar treatment may be adopted. ' This disease is specially described in connection with the general I consideration of Ulcers. (4.) Syphilitic Ulcer of the nose differs from the lupoid and can- I cerous forms of ulcer. It usually attacks the ala or the tip of the nose, ! and commences as a small pimple, red, hard, and somewhat painful,' 1 which suppurates and opens into an ulcer. Sometimes, the skin over i the fibro-cartilages inflames and gives way, by a crack or fissure. Thus I far there is nothing characteristic. But the resulting ulcer has an I u-regular, fringed margin. The discharge is ichorous and encrustino- ; tthe ulcer, at the same time, eating away beneath. A faint blush s surrounds the ulcer. These appearances must, however, be taken in (connection with other present or past manifestations of constitutional s syphilis, to complete the diagnosis. The treatment is that of secondary syphilis. Mr. Ure found iodide cof potassium—when mercury had been previously given—most effica- ccious, m conjunction with a lotion of bichloride of mercury, a grain a and a half to the ounce of water. Under this treatment, an ulcerated f patch soon healed, which had extended from the ala to the tip of the '•nose,^and which was of fifteen months' standing. (5.) Ncevus, as sometimes met with in the skin of the nose offers nno peculiarities; the vascular growth presents the same appearances ias in other parts, and the same methods of removal are available. But lilt IS very desirable to preserve the skin so as to prevent disfigurement - A purphsh patch wiU often yield to cauterization, by touchino- it with II nitric acid; and deeper-seated n^vus maybe removed by subcutaneous ligature.

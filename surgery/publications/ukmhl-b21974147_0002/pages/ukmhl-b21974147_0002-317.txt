HAEE-LIP. 289 habit of preserving a small slip of the flap of the long half of the lip, and of attaching it to the under surface of the shorter half, that there might be no notch or fissure remaining after cicatrization. Mr. Holmes Coote prefers two fine silver sutures, one at the angle of the fissure and the other at the red of the lip, instead of a second hare-lip pin; the former, it is alleged, holding these parts more immovably in contact. The time for withdrawing the pins is, usually, about the fourth day; or the labial one may be left for a day or two longer. The pin must be gently withdrawn, and the twisted thread caked with the oozed blood should still be left undisturbed on the lip, to which it adheres as a plaster. If this precaution be taken for some days longer, there will scarcely be any necessity that the recently united wound should be supported by " adhesive strapping," or for the use of the spring cheek- ^<«r^Sr™^ compressor devised by Mr. Hainsby. Simple sutures — without the aI'IV^A steadying support of pins—are in MM (^m favour with some Surgeons. Mr. m An uH lim Erichsen has treated hare-lip, double ffl W| | ^^^^^a Ji|l\ and single, in this way for many || ^Mr^ llljll^^^^ years, and most successfully. He, W Jf \^\\ ^^^^^a however, restricts the eligibility of * u this modification of the treatment m""^^^^ to cases unconnected with very ^^^^^^^^^^jjiBBP*'*'^^ wide fissure in the palate or great inter-maxillary projection. Under these circumstances the pins are preferable. Doiible hare-lip, vnthout malformation of the upper jaw, is treated on a similar principle. If the central lobe between the fissures be of full breadth and length down to the prolabium, the margins of both fissures should be pared independently, and united separately; but if the central portion be short and rounded, it should be sliced to a point downwards and the pared margins of the lip united, embracing this Httle V-shaped piece above and coming into contact with each other below. In both cases, the same needles are sufficient to retain the two fissures, by transfixing the central lobe ; the threads are wound round as before. Both fissures may be pared and treated thus simultaneously; or at separate periods, in order, it is said, not unnecessarily to increase the chances of failure. The median—inter-maxillary—portion of bone, containing the incisor teeth, which not unf requently complicates double hare-lip, must be dealt with when it projects so as to prevent union of the wound. The pro- jectmg portion may be removed with small cutting-pliers; or it can generally be made to recede by gentle pressure, in the course of a few weeks,—this plan of treatment having the obvious advantage of pre- serving the incisor teeth.

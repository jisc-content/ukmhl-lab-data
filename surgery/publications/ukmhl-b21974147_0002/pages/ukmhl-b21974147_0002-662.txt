But this deposit of phosphoric salts contains only part of the whole phosphoric acid present. Bv far the greater portion remains concealed in the soluble phosphate of soda Which IS never spontaneously precipitated under any circumstances. ' io determine the wliole amount of phosphoric acid eliminated it is necessary to ascertain the amount of this alkaline phosphate, as well as that ot the earthy phosphates. Both together represent the phos- phoric diathesis. For this purpose the following experimental process is recommended by JJr. Bence Jones:—About a thousand grains of urine are to be weighed, and the earthy phosphates precipitated by pure ammonia, free Irom carbonate. These should be filtered, washed with ammoniacal water, and heated to redness; adding at last a drop or two of nitric acid, ihe amount of earthy phosphates is determined by weic^hin.- the residue The alkaline phosphates are estimated by taking Ibout five hundred grains of urine, adding an excess of chloride of calcium and then pure ammonia. Thus all the phosphoric acid is pre- cipitated as phosphate of lime. This is to be filtered, well washed, and the filter and the precipitate burnt with a drop or two of nitric acid. If the filtration has been slow, it is necessary to redissolve the residue m a platinum crucible by hydrochloric acid, and to reprecipi- tate by pure ammonia, when the filtration will take place very rapidly After being burnt, the crucible is weighed, and by deducting the pre- viously determined earthy phosphates, the difference may be taken as the amount of alkaline phosphate.* Oxalate of Lime (C^Og + CaO + 2H0) in JJm^^.—Flysical Cha- racters of ZJmie.—Clouded with much epithelium, and of a bright amber colour, somewhat resembling the bright golden-sherry colour of lithic acid urine, but contrasting with the pale, whey-like urine of earthy phosphates, and the turbid orange-brown of ammoniacal urine, which, moreover, presents an iridescent pellicle on its surface, and is ropy and fetid. The specific gravity varies extremely, from 1-015, or less, to 1-025, or more. Quantity of urine not much increased. Re- action decidedly acid, No deposit of oxalate, unless present in some quantity, and after some hours or days, then appearing as minute, colourless, transparent, hemp-seed concretions, mingled with mucus as a cloudy deposit. On being heated, the urine may become gelatinous, yet retain its transparency. Microscopical Characters.—Crystals in three forms : octohedra, the most common, or as dumb-bell shaped crystals; occasionally in tbe shape of small, red blood-globules, probably the earhest stage of dumb- bell oxalate. All these are here represented. (Fig. 8G5.) * See " rhil. Trans.," 1845, p. 365.

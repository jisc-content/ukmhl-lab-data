41 RESULTS OF HIP-JOINT EXCISION. in 18 cases, or 83 per cent. On tlie other hand, acetabular disease has had moi-e favourable results of operation. Of the 10 cases in which perforation had taken place, 6, or 60 per cent., recovered; 2 only, or 20 per cent., died. Of the 4 in which not only perforation existed, but abscess also within the pelvis, 2 recovered, 2 died—50 per cent, either way. Of the 3 in which the acetabulum was trephined for the evacuation of matter from the pelvis, 2, or 66 per cent., recovered ; 1, or 33 per cent., died. Therefore, in the whole 20 of these apparently most unfavourable cases for excision, the mortahty was only 5—1 in 4, or 25 per cent. The relation of pelvic disease to mortality after opera- tion has abeady been noticed. Dislocation of the head of the femur having taken place, the percentage of recoveries was actually 46, against 23 where it had remained in its socket; the total nnniber of cases compared being 143. Of my own first 8 cases of hip-joint ex- cision, in 4 there was dislocation, and they all recovered equally with the 4 in which dislocation had not occurred. Another equally large series of cases—112, British and foreign— has been collected by Dr. R. R. Good, late Surgeon in the Confederate American Army. This series is the more complete, as it embraces the most essential particulars respecting excision of the hip-joint for disease, both in regard to its mortality and the state of the limb. We are thus enabled to take a commanding view of the whole subject; and in order to observe the results and their relationship more clearly, I have tabu- lated them.

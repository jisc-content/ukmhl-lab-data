Slight traction downwards before .^in ' compression will sometimes facilitate reduction ; apparently by t^rntents from the neck of the sac. The taxis having been thus employed for a few minutes, any fluid in the sac may partially mss intothe abdomen, accompanied with some diminution m the size rdtension of the tumour; the flatus of the intestine may also escape 'nto tie Intestinal canal above the stricture, accompanied with a gurg- ■ng sensation and sound, and then the intestine --^^-g'f^^P a sudden ierk.

It is most practicable in femoral hernia.-where the upper edge of the saphenous opening is sharply defined and especially as^felt in"a thm person ; or in inguinal hernia,-when the stricture is seated at the external abdominal ring. _ The aw.ount of compression justifiable, varies with the state ot the strangulated intestine, as denoted by the one symptom-vomiting. Befoi°e this has occurred, the pressure should be gentle; after vomiting any manipulation must be particularly de icate and cautious, lest the gangrenous bowel be irreparably damaged or burst. The .^umizo of the taxis is equally important; for moderate but continued manipula- tion may be as damaging as a violent effort at reduction, and any such handling is more likely to induce inflammation. Half an hour may be roundly stated as the period beyond which the taxis should not be pro- longed The taxis should be regulated by the efforts which had been previously made to reduce the hernia ; but, as neither the amount nor continuance of any such manipulation may be ascertainable, it will be better to err on the safe side of this question, rather than risk any further damage to the intestine. The size and tension of the hernia should also be taken into account. As a general rule—Hey observes— " the smaller the hernia, the less hope there is of reducing it by the taxis."

SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 122 pliers. The arteries requiring ligature or torsion vary with the situa- tion of the amputation ; in the middle third of the 1 eg, the anterior and posterior tibials between the bones of the stump must be tied ; in the upper third just below the knee, the popliteal trunk may not have bifurcated, and one artery alone may have to be ligatured. Another mode of performing this amputation is by transfixion and the formation of a posterior flap first, and then the anterior semilunar flap. The stump, in either case, is apt to bag and drop, owing to the bulk and weight of the posterior flap ; which is not less than three inches in length, and bulky in proportion to the muscular development of the calf. Teale's Amputation, by a long anterior and a short posterior rect- angular flap.—This operation obviates the difficulty last referred to; but its comparative merits in other respects, as a mode of amputation, have been already considered. Artificial legs are here represented; the common form, a wooden or " box-leg " (Fig. 678) ; the more complete leg (Fig. 579). Fig. 578. Fig. 579. Bes idts.—Amputation of the leg is, on the whole, a success- ful operation ; but, like other amputations, the mortality differs according to whether the operation be performed for disease or injury, and the nature and the situation of either. For disease, in 22 cases, there was only 1 death ; whereas, for injury, in 31 cases, there were 15 deaths, or say 1 in 2 (Spence). So also, for disease, the average death-rate per cent, is 25"5 ; whilst, for injury, it rises to 26, as in the American War ; 37, as in the Crimea; or even 40 per cent., as in the London and Provincial Hospitals during a period of three years. Primary ampu- tation is generally more fatal than secondary; but Mr. Bryant's statistics of cases in Guy's Hospital seem to reverse this rule; at the

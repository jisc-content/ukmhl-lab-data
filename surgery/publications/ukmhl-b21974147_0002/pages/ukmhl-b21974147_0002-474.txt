Atrophy of the glandular structure sometimes accompanies the development of the cancer. Cysts are liable to form in connection with the scirrhous growth, constituting a cystic cancerous tumour; which is thus rendered more irregularly lobulated, and partly solid, partly fl.actuating more or less perceptibly, under pi'essure with the fingers. The surrounding parts become involved, and generally the tumour is the seat of pain, perhaps severe ; and which is variously described by patients, as dull and aching, shooting or stabbing, burning, etc. These terms express the different land and degree of pain experienced as the tumour progresses to ulceration; the burning or scalding sensation supervening after the lancinating or the heavy pains in the earlier stage of the disease. But usually during the first year, at least, schirrous cancer of the breast is painless, except perhaps there may be slight twinges occasionally, or after handling the tumour; subse- quently, the pain—having the varying characters mentioned—is aggra- vated in proportion to the rapidity of growth, or during any attack of inflammation or sloughing. The gland acquires adhesion to the pectoral luuscle, and to the skin over the tumour, the integument getting bound down with some dimpling or puckering (Fig. 766), or having a brawny character, and a glazed or greasy appearance with the pores enlarged; the nipple is often drawn in by the adherent and Fig. 766.

Eeddish-brown discolouration of the integument, at some tightly adherent part, is followed by the formation of a crack or fissure, which scabs over, while ulceration proceeds underneath the scap.

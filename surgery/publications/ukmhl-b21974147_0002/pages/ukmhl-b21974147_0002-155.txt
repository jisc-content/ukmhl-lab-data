Btichet-leg, with substitute mechanism for leg below the knee (Pig. 586)—A, bucket; B, knee-bolt; C, D, E, situation of springs, for mock muscles, governing the action of the ankle and toe joints.

(4.) Bigg's leg, a modification of Bly's and Mark's legs. (Fig. 588.) This is, perhaps, the simplest, strongest, lightest, and cheapest artificial leg or limb ever constructed.

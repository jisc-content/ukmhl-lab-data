EHINOPLASTIC OPERATIONS. 283 in bringing the clieeks closer together, over the aperture, and in making a columna, as a base of support for the frontal flap. Two vertical incisions are made through the upper lip, on either side of Fig. 6G8. the middle line, including a portion about half an inch broad; and this is turned up. The lateral portions of the lip are brought to- gether with hare-lip pins and twisted sutures. The upturned portion of the lip is then split from below upwards, so that the mucous and cutaneous surfaces shall be continuous and looking inwards, the raw surface presenting outwards. Thus the vertical depth of the labial flap IS nearly doubled in extent. The cheeks are now to be dissected np from their deep attachments, on either side outwards, for about an inch in extent, or sufiiciently to form two lateral flaps ; they are brought together across the lower part of the chasm, in such manner that their deep raw surfaces shall be in contact with the raw surface of the up- turned labial flap,—the parts being retained in position by wire sutures, and tension taken off the lateral flaps, by stout hare-lip pins, trans- nxmg these parts across the nasal cavity, whereby the margins are Jilted up at the lines of junction. By a subsequent operation, the irontal flap is made in the nsual manner, from the skin of the forehead, and twisted down; the edges of the aperture having first been pared' and the skin over the lower part of the lateral flaps having been reflected from below upwards, in order to lay bare an extended raw ^urtace on which to implant the forehead flap. The parts are retained -» situ by wire sutures. roJ^'l-^"^'^^'^^ nasi.—This portion of the nose may alone require storation, in consequence of its separate destruction by disease in- noip if ^^^.'^^P^i™- The nostrils thus present one large gap, and the PW??™'"? depressed,—more so with destruction of the bones— ^reat detormTty results.

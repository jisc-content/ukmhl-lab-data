SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 6G8 lifchotrity or litliotomy. Hence the corrective use of acids is indicated, Jind particularly by injection into the bladder, as in the treatment of chronic cystitis. No special preventive treatment is required for cystine_ concretion, which is comparatively rare, and any tendency to which will be counteracted by the measures appropriate for uric acid calculus. _ Solvent Treatment.—The removal of a calculus by solution is a mode o£ cure, which has been attempted by either of two kinds of agents: by chemical solvent agents,—lithontnptics administered by the mouth, or by injection into the bladder ; by electrolysis,—the transmission of an electric or galvanic current, for the dissolution ot stone in the bladder. . ™ (a.) Chemical solvent agents comprise alkahes and acids, ihe former class of remedies may be employed for the removal of calculi which are soluble in alkahes, i.e. uric acid, urates, and cystine; the latter class, for those calculi which are soluble m acids, i.e. oxalate ot lime and phosphatic concretions. The mode of administration of either class of these remedies might be by the mouth, or by injection into the bladder. Practically, however, the chemical solubility of urinary calculi, and the mode of attacking them, seems to amount to this : that uric acid calculi only, and alUed concretions, are soluble by alkalies, and as administered by the mouth ; phosphatic calculi only by acids and by injection of the acid solution. Oxalate of lime calcuh cannot be dissolved by any known solvent agent or method of admmistration It would appear also from Dr. W. Roberts's original series of experiments and clinical observations, that renal calcuh are more generally amenable to solvent treatment than vesical calculi; ot course necessarily, by the internal method, or passage of the remedy through ^^^Theilternal method is applicable for the solution of vesical calculi, according to the observations referred to, only m cases of uric acid calculus, where the stone is not large, and the urme is acid Certain rules should be observed m applying this solvent treat- ment; namely, to keep the urine contv>mously alkalme, ^^^Joj'^'^^^ this state to a certain degree.

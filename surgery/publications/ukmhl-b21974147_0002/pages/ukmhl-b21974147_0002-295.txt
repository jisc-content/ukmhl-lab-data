Phigging the Nares.—This is most readily accomplished by passing an elastic cathetei', armed with a long piece of strong whipcord fastened to its eye end, along the floor of the nasal fossa, through the posterior nares into the pliarynx (Fig. 657); then, seizing the cord with forceps as it appears behind the soft palate, it is drawn forwards through the mouth, while the catheter is withdrawn from the nostril. The cord, thus passing round the back of the soft palate, hangs out of the mouth and nose. An oblong plug of lint or compressed sponge, of sufficient Fig. 657. Fig. G5S. size to occupy the posterior nares, is then firmly tied transversely in a loop of the cord as it hangs from the mouth ; and by pulling the cord through the nose, the plug is drawn back behind the soft palate into the posterior nares, guided and adjusted by the forefinger of the other Land. (Fig. 658.) The anterior nares is then plugged with a com- press of lint or sponge.

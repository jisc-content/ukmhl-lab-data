Amputation has been resorted to in extreme cases, and after the removal of one breast the other has much diminished ...^ZZl"^ VL^^" l^^- """^^^ Mammary gland is occasionally seen ; the breast thus attaimng possibly to an enormous size. In one such case, which my colleague Dr. Cockle showed me, the fatty breasts of a young woman aged nineteen, weighed each about eleven pounds. ±5at the tumour of the fatty breast is evidently continuoiis with the fat around; and this is its main diagnostic point of distinction from hvper- trophy of the gland itself. Treatment here also is of little avail. Liquor potassae in W doses as originally recommended by Sir B. Brodie for fatty tumour, may have some beneficial influence. j j- Atrophy, or wasting of the gland-tissue of the breast, commonly taJces place as the procreative function ceases in advancino- life The lactiferous ducts remain, and sometimes contain a tenacious mucus, liie gland, otherwise, is very generally replaced by fat; thus present- ing the outward form of the organ. In extreme atrophy of the breast, as found m old women, the arteries are not unfrequentlv converted into bony tubes; a degeneration of these vessels, of which"specimens may be seen m the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, 2811 2812 • and one in Guy's Museum. Occasionally, in early life, atrophy occurs; the gland not enlarging during pregnancy, nor secreting any milk after parturition. Prolonged iactation, and its rapid repetition, have an atrophying effect; and some- times weaning is followed by shrinking of the gland-tissue, so that scarcely any breast remains ; the gland, however, resumes its size and secretory power, even more perfectly than in full-breasted women, during a subsequent pregnancy.

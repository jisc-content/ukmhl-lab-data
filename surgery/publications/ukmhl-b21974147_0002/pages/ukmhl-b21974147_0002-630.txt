Th W L P^^^<^°"«"m extending from the back of the pelvis to the bladder and which bound the recto-vesical pouch, form two pos- If X ^'igaments ; the lateral reflections, extending from the sides ot the bladder, to the pelvis, form two late^-al false ligaments; and the superior reflection gives rise to the superior or suspensory false liga- ment -«nt all these so-called ligaments represent one continued rellection of the peritoneum, as conducted apparently by the course of tlie internal ihac arteries, and their continuation, the obliterated hvpo- gastric arteries m the adult. Guided by these vessels, and, it may be said by the ureters, the peritoneum passes forwards along the sides ot thB middle portion of the rectum to the under surface of the bladder thence up its sides to the summit, and so to the abdominal wall. In the latter situation, the obliterated urachus, a fibro-cellular cord passes from the top of the bladder, in the interval between the two hypogastrics ; and with them reflecting the peritoneum upwards these three cords ascend along the Unea alba to the umbilicus. The inte ligaments of the bladder are prostatic portions of the recto-vesical fascia, on either side of the pelvis; /o^^r such portions of this fascia, or ligaments, being recognized : two anterior, in front of the prostate, and two lateral, at the sides of that body. Their derivation from the recto-vesical fascia, and their attachments as ligaments of the bladder niay be traced from the pelvic fascia. This fascia descends fi'om the brim ot the pelvis, and covering the upper part of the obturator internus muscle, as far as a white line extending between the body of the pubes and the spine of the ischium—the fascial origin of the levator ani muscle—the fascia there splits into two layers. One layer, being con- tinued downwards over the lower part of the obturator muscle, is thence named the ohkirator fascia; the other layer, inclining inwards and downwards from the white line, passes as a broad expansion, over the upper surface of the levator ani muscle, to the side of the rectum, bladder, and prostate, thus acquiring the name of the recto-vesical fascia. This visceral layer of the pelvic fascia assumes ligamentous connections in the middle line. Attached to the back of the body of the pubes, just internal to the pubic origin of the levator ani muscle, the fascia, on either side of the pelvis, passes backwards, in front of the prostate, to the neck and adjoining part of the bladder, in the shape of two roundish, strong white bands, a right and a left, forming two anterior true ligaments; while another portion of the fascia, broader and thinner, passing back on the side of the prostate, to the neck and side of the bladder, forms two lateral true ligaments. The anterior true ligaments, therefore, are better defined ; and between the two is a cellular interval, in which lies the dorsal vein of the penis, or clitoris in the female. These bands of the fascia cover in the anterior fibres of the levator ani—the levatores prostatas—which are spread over the prostate, here closing the outlet of the pelvis; a continuation from the lateral bands completely ensheaths the prostate, as a c.ipsule, an

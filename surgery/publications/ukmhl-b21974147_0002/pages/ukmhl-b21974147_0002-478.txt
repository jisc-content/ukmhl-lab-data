It is unnecessary to point to illustrations of these opposite views m the practice of Surgeons, present or past. The truth, as in many other matters, lies between these two extreme rules ot treatment. The intermediate plan has reference to the indi- vidual case, both with regard to the local condition of the cancer and the constitutional power of the patient. Assuming a case to be thus ineligible for operation, the followin<r plan ot treatment should be pursued. The disease being a perversion ot nutrition as mamfested by a reproductive growth, the pathological and rational indication of treatment remedially would be, to rectify this deviation of the nutritive process so as to arrest the growth of cancer, and possibly lead to a predominance of the reverse process — absorption, and thence the eventual disappearance of the tumour Any such control over the formative or vital changes in nutrition, or over the chemical changes of the nutritive material—any such mode of arresting cancer-growth, is quite beyond our present knowledc^e of physiology and pathology, in respect to this process. It only remains, therefore, for the practitioner to avaU himself of such knowledge as experience has supplied. A generally nutritious diet, as the phrase goes, will suggest the object to be attained, in the selection of dietetic resources; but it is absolutely necessary to watch and discover, in each case, what particular articles of diet are most suitable for the improve- ment of the patient's general nutrition, and may have any marked influence on the progress of the disease. Anodynes, applied topically and administered internally, not only relieve the often severe and pro- longed suffering incident to this disease; but these medicinal agents are important adjuncts to our dietetic resources, in procuring sleep and repose of the nervous system, requisite for a more healthy nutrition. Thus, narcotics, and in particular the prej)arations of ojDium, are highly advantageous ; while conium ointment is, I think, the most soothing topical anodyne, although aconitine ointment or belladonna plaster may be equally so in some cases. The preparations of ether—sulphuric and chloric—and chlorodyne, are most efficacious for the relief of paroxysmal pains of a neuralgic character; and here quinine and iron are serviceable, as tonics. But tonics have probably a yet deeper remedial value. Iron may have some restorative influence in proportion to the cachexia, which plainly denotes a morbid blood-condition, one element of which is a diminution of the red-corpuscles. Quinine is remedial in sustaining the general circulation, and thus supplying the pabulum of an improved assimilation ; while stomachic tonics, such

SURaiCAL ANATOMY OF THE BLADDER, PROSTATE GLAND, ETC. 611 prostate gland; then, becoming simply membranous, tbe tube pene- trates the triangular ligament, under the arch of the pubes ; and then entering the spongy structure of the penis, it is continued to the end of the glans and opens externally as the meatus urinarius. The direc- tion of the urethral canal, in its course forwards, is that of a double curve ; the prostate and mem- branous portions, and the Fig. 853.* commencement of the spongy portion, or its bulbous part, together form a curve, down- wards, forwards, and upwards to the front of "the pubes; from which point the remainder of the spongy portion descends in the penis. This double curve, however, depends upon the state of the penis; for when this organ is erect, or raised upwards towards the pubes, the second curve forms with the first a single curve, thus continuing the concavity of the curve upwards,—as in passing a catheter. The urethra performs the excretory function of transmitting and dischara:- mg the urme from the bladder; but it also transmits the semi- nal fluid in sexual intercourse. The three portions of the urethra, already indicated, severally demand a separate notice. The 'prostatic urethra is that portion of the tube which extends from the vesical ori- fice to the membranous por- tion, about a line behind the triangular ligament,—its pos- terior layer. This portion of the urethra passes through the prostate gland, from base to apex; lying at first above the middle lobe, and afterwards nearer to the upper than to the lower surface of the gland, by about two-thirds of its substance below * The mucous membrane of the Urethra, in Male.—a, a, a, lacunm fof Morffa^uil • i;^'a^;nrfTT^^^Pf"1-°^' °^ minute glands); c, fold of mucous membranf ffrm-' En ° if f *° the fossa naviculans ; d, prolongation of the corpus spongiosum, S.nff n ^ r'' '^'Ja^'^D^ 1° tJ^e fossa navicularis (lacuna ma^a); f, f" lon-i tudmal folds of mucous membrane, effaced upon dilation • g cauut eal innHni, m.

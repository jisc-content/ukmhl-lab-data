From elaborate experimental observations by Professor Gr5ss, it would appear that the direction of a wound,- having this limited extent,-in relation to the axis of the ^^^f'^^^^^ of no practical consequence; whether such a wound be longitudinal, transverse, or oblique. A lacerated wound of larger size may be also unattended with faecal extravasation, the peristaltic a,ction of the intes- tine being deadened. Subsequently, in any case, the speedy effusion ot plastic lymph tends to close the aperture. The absence of the charac teristic pain and collapse, as symptoms of feculent extravasation, is therefore, no conclusive evidence that the bowel is neither ruptured nor wounded. Emphysema of the abdominal wall may arise from the escape of flatus through an intestinal aperture, into the subperitoneal cellular tissue. Commencing, usually, in one or the other flank, the peculiar, pitting, crepitating swelling extends forwards around the ab- dominal parietes, and upwards towards the axilla. This symptom, is the result alike of rupture or wound. In rare instances, feculent matter, or food extravasated from the intestine or the stomach, has become encysted, and leading to the formation of abscess, has been safely- discharged externally. Thus, Archer relates a remarkable case m which, after an incised wound of the stomach, with escape of alimentary matter into the peritoneum, an abscess opened in the groin, and gave vent to portions of cabbage ; the patient recovering. A ball which has

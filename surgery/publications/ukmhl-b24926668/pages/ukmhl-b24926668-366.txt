anccs, and without encountering any of its word; j but, on the other hand, there are many who, in a very Ihort time, run through ail its Itagcs. Some- times the firft appearance is a mere fimple enlarge- ment and induration of the body of the tcfticle; void of pain, without inequality oi furfacc, and pro- ducing no uneafinefs nor inconvenience, except what is occafioncd by its mere weight. And in l'oine few inftanccs it remains thus for a confiderablc time, without vifible or material alteration ; but, in other inftanccs, very foon after its appearance in this mild manner, it fuddenly becomes unequal and knotty ; and is attended with very acute pains, darting up to the loins and back ; but ftill remains entire ; that is, it does not burft through the integuments. In fliort, inch is the variety of the appearances of this difenfc, that defeription can hardly afford u:i adequate idea of it. Sometimes the difordcr feems to be merely local, that is, confined to the tcfticle ; at other times, there is a pallid or leaden countenance, indigeftion, naufea, colic pains, fudden purgings, &c. fufticicntly indi- cating a vitiated habit and difeafed vitccra. The J progrefs alfo which it makes from the teftis upward, is very uncertain ; the difeafe afteding the fpcrmatic proccfs, in fame fubjefts, for a great length of time; while, in others, it totally fpoils the tefticle very \ foon, and almoft as foon fcizes tlac fpcrmatic cord. Araongft the miftaken caulcs of a feirrhous tef- 1 tide, Mr. Pott reckons the hernia humoralis. He does nor lay, that a farcocek never follows an her- nia humoralis, but that it docs not at any time ncccfiarilv enufe or produce it. Mr. Bell fays, j that a hardened ftatc of the teftis and epididy- mis, produced originally by a venereal taint, does in fomc inftanccs degenerate into the worft l'pe- cics of farcocele. However, in general, the hernia humoralis is one of the dilealcs which Ihouhl be d:f- j tinguilhed from the jhr.x\Ic. A quantity of water

difcharge, the hard tumour of the fcrotum leifens. tUpen carting off the laft Hough, .the hardnefs is en- i tirely gone, and the wound immediately cicatrizes, 'Vide Elfe on the Hydrocele cf the Tunica Vaginalis Fcftis. The method by Incision, is as follows. The ypatient being placed upon a table of a convenient height, properly fecured by two affiftants, and the fcrotum lying nearly upon the edge of the table, firmly grafp the tumour with one hand, fo as to r.make ir fomcvvhat tenfe on the anterior part, then with a common round-edged fcalpcl, divide the ex- ternal teguments by one continued incifion, from the uperior extremity of the tumour, along its anterior iurface, to the moil depending point of the fwelling. Thus, the tunica vaginalis is laid bare from one ex- tremity to the other, about the breadth cf half an nch. Now make an opening with a lancet, at the ipper extremity of the vaginal coat, big enough to receive your finger, which introduce, and with the orobc-pointed biftoury, conducted upon your finger, 'ividc the fac to the bottom in the courfc of the firft aicifion. If the teftis protrudes from the wound, cplacc' it with caution, and preclude the exter- lal air from it as quickly as poflible, which, if tone Of the tunica vaginalis is to be removed, aay be immediately done, by finifhing the drdT- ag dirc&ly on the fac being opened. If the fac i not very hard, and not very thick, it will not e ncccfTiry to remove any portion of it. As foon as tie incifion has been made, infert between the tuni- i vaginalis, and the body of the teftis, flips of foft nen, fpread with fomc Ample ointment. They pro- ucc list's irritation than dry lint, and are afterwards lore eafiiy removed. Vide Bell's Syftem of Surgery, ol. i.

I s c child’s head prefling the neck of the bladder again It the os pubis; a tumour, or ulcer, in the proftatc gland ; a defluxion of humour on the neck of the bladder ; a retention of urine ; a pally in the detrufor urinte; a retention of hardened excrements in the inteftinum re£Uim, &c. A fpurious ifehury is when the kidnits fecrcte no urine, or when the ureters either do net receive, or do not traniir.it it ; and this may happen from inflammation of the ureters, or in the kidnics. When the fupprefled urine is lodged in the blad- der, a pain and levelling is obferved about the pubes j a fup predion from relaxation is diftinguiihcd from fuppreifton from flrifturc ; firft, by the little pain attending the di(order; fecondly, by the introduc- tion of the catheter ; thirdly, from the diftenticn of the bladder, obfcrvable from the fulncfs above t,he pubes; fourthly, from no fli riulus being edited hi the bladder to .dlfcharge ,anv fluid wherewith you difiend it. If inflammation in the kidnit's. is :he- caul’e, the pain and heat are principally in that ■ - gion. If a (lone in the kidnits give rife td tlie com- plaint, a vomiting-is an attendant • fymptom. i; ,i (lone in the bladder obftru£U the urine, a paisl i- telt there, and alfo along the urerhtrn; a mucus, or pus, is excreted with pale urine ; and, generally, tht ftcmri may he felt, if the catheter is introduced. Jf from inflammation in this neck of the bluddir, there i; alfo pain and a tumour there, the pain v ill be much iucrealed if the perinacum is but llig'iiv prcflfcf; and if a finger is introduced into tin anus. ; in! turned towards the bladder, a tumour wiij t >iiiy he perceived. _ -. If this difordtr is in a great degree, there" a tcncfmus, cohlncfs of tht extremum-, a vomiting, and a febrile pulfe.

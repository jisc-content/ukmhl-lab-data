E M P In cafe of water being collefted in both cavities of :the cheft, the operation muft be performed on both Tides; but fome little time Ihould intervene between the nrft and fecond. Before the fecond operation, the air ;nuft be expelled, which may be done (after with- drawing the canula from the oppofite fide) by en- deavouring to fill the lungs with air, which will ex- pel a confiderable part of what was collected between :he pleura and lungs, by the perforation. This, re- peated feveral times, will expel almoft the whole of the air collttted between the pleura and lungs. After :khis, the Ikin muft be drawn over the wound, and, by a tsomprefs and 'bandage, the parts will unite without further trouble. During each infpiration, the retraced (kin fliould be | drawn over the fore. Another mode of drawing off the air, is by an ex- 1 laufting fyringe, or an elaftic vigetable bottle, with a mouth of ivory or metal fitted to the opening in the pleura. When this operation is performed for the evacuation of blood, it is fometimes fo coagulated as not to pals oft by the perforation. In this cafe the opening in the pleura Ihould be enlarged to the extent of an inch or fo; bur if this does not anfwer, tepid water muft he r.jetlcd with great caution. It may be necefl'ary to epeat it frequently, in order to foften and diffoWe the blood. The colltdVioii of blood in the thorax being, in con- equenre of a rupture of a blood velfcl, induced either ■y a fvabtured bone, or fome extraneous body being •relied into it ; the incifion lliouid be made contiguous o tlie part aifidted, not only for evacuating the blood, pur to remove the detached bone, or foreign body. When a wound with a lharp pointed inftrument is he caulc of the collection, and the mound is Jituated in be inferior part of the thorax, it is merely nccefiary to mlarge the wound. When

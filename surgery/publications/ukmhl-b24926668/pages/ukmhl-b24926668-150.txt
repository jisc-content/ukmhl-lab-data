To prevent inflammation, bleeding, with low diet, muft be diredded ; local bleeding by leeches, is, perhaps, the moft ufeful. I .et the patient obferve that pofture in which he is moft eafy. D'Jlocai.on of the Clavicles. This may happen at ei- ther cxtrtmitv of thtfe bones, but is more frequent at their junftion with the fternum, than at the acromion. A c<nliderable degree of ftiffnel's and immobility in the correfponding joint cf the ftioulder, commonly attends this diflocation. To reduce it, the fame general me- thods mull be employed as in cafe of fradfurc of this bone, except, ra’fixg toe arm, as it tends to pufh the bone further out of its place. 1 he redudfion eftedted, the weight of the fore arm muft be fupported. The head anil fhouldcrs muft likewife be fupported, and a moderate pieflure by bolfters muft be made upon the end of the difplaced bone. For thefe purpofes the long roller, applies fo as to form the figure of 8 upon the fhoulders and upper part of the breaft, is employed. Mr. Bell, however, recommends a machine.

But a diflocation is diftinguhh- ab!e from a fradture, by the pain being moft fee ere at the articulation, and by no part of the bone yield- ing, excepting at this very fp< r. If the rib is n.n ic- duetd by the'eaufe which produced the luxation being removed, the befit method of reducing it, will be to bend the body forward over a cafk, or other cylindn- cal body, while the vertebra immediately above anf below, arc preffed inward with as much force, ns can with fafety be applied to them.

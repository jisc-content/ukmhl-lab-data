SCO in the navy, a folution of copper from want of care to clean the vclTels in which their food is boiled; animal diet which is not well preferred with fait; infection, &c. The prefence of this difordcr is known by a pale, or a yellowilh complexion, which gradually grows darker; a melancholy dejection of l'pirit, a lailitude, a ftiffhefs in the joints, a feeblenefs in the knees, and on uftng the leaft exercife, there is great wcaknefs, with a difficulty of breathing; the gums loon after begin to itch, lwell, and bleed, on being gently rubbed, and have an untifual livid rednefs; they are fofr, fpongy, putrid and fungous; this change in the gums. Dr. Lind fecms.to think, is the pathogno- monic fymptom of the difeafe. Haemorrhages alfo happen in other parts: the {kin feels dry, except in the laft ftage or the difeafe, when a cold clammy moifutre may be obferved on the lkin. In fomc the {kin is rough, but generally it is fmooth and fliining, and covered with many fpots, as if bruited; thefe arc of a yellow or reddifh colour, and as the difeafe increafes, they become blacker. In fomc, the ankles lwell towards the evening, and arc fettled again in the morning. Many other fymptoms occur, but they are accidental. If a fcorburic diarrhoea comes on, and there is a pain in the bread, it is generally fatal. Ulcerated lungs arc a f 'cquent confequencc of the fwjy; the ftocls are very often ft vc: the urine fpcedily becomes putrid. In the (econd ftage, the patient fometimes lofes the tile of his limbs, the flexor tendons in the hams arc contracted, the patient frequently faints upon the lealt motion ; and, on be- ing fuddenly moved into the frefti air, it fometimes happens that he expires. Hemorrhages from the lungs, inteftincs, Jkc. now are frequently happening: but the appetite is often good, though the lpirits are low. The third ftage has many violent, and ulually fatal fymptoms. j

F I S \ cclTary to be well affmed of the attendance of this accident, or the contrary, lnflances of the ilf effedts of fiffttr'ei have happened ten months or more after the accident. It is not fimply the Jijfure that is dange- rous, but the violence that occalioned it, which alfo occafions the teguments‘and the bone to fuller: all the bad fymptoms depend principally upon the rup- ture of a great number of vends, and a detcnfion of extravafated liquids, whence the bone is corrupted ; and when this happens, a fudden and uncxpcflcd death is often the confequence. The cranium can- not be fiffured without being alfo contufcd, by which many vcffels in the fubllancc of the bone and in the diploe arc broken. Trepanning feems to be the propcrcfl method of relief, though tiic method recommended by Mr. Bromficld, in concullions of the brain, has alone, cffedlcd a cure. Fistula, in furgery, is a kind of ulcer. It dif- fers from a fmus thus : a Jiftula is narrower, gene- rally continues longer, and has its internal fur face and its orifice for the moil part callous. The icat of a fijlula is in the cellular membrane. It is known to be prefent when there is an aperture on the furf&cl of the body from which a famous, or other matter, neither flows or may be preffed out; its depth and di4 redlion is difeovered by a probe ; or, if the direc-l tions arc various, warm water may be injedfed thcreinl and if the courfe is near the fkin, it will be oblerved| by the elevation made by the water, or, if othcrwifeJ the quantity of water retained will determine th<j! lire of the cavity. Mr. Bell, in his Treatife on Ulcers, includes thejj fiflula in liis’ fpecics of ftnuous ulcer. By fmuous ulcer, he means that kind of fore which has one of more openings running into it from chirks of th<i fame, or of different diredtions. A fmus, as thui deferibed, he fays, is the moil fimplc Hate of tin chfordcr, and is, by long continuance, or by the ule U‘

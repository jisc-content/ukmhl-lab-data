AMP — \ the tourniquet as near as polfible to the top of th limb. Divide the nvevnbrana-adifpofa, and tcndinou fafcia, by a circular incifum, about three inches be neath the tourniquet. Pull the retraced Ikin 3bou an inch upwards'^and at the edge of it, with one per pcndicular ftroke of the knife, divide the mufclc down to the bone. This will give room to lccur the femoral artery and all the mufcular branche: I\ow take a large ftrong-round edged fcalpel, and com meucingat the upper edge of the circular cut, on th pofterior part of the thigh, cut down to the bone, an carry it up of the fame depth toa little above thegrea trocnanter into the joint. Make a fimilar incifion o the oppofite fide of the limb, at a fufficicnt dillanc from the femoral artery, and completely down to tit bone. Difleft the flefh from the bone, and let th flaps formed of them be taken care of by aififtanr; while any artery that may be cut is fecured. To dil engage the head of the femur from the acetabulum turn the bone in different clire&ions, and particular! prefs it inwards, and divide the ligament with a fcal pel or firm probe-pointed biftoury. This done, clca the coagulated blood away, place the mufcles as nca as poflible in their natural fituations, and draw th two flaps together, lb as to cover the fore neatly ; fc cure them in this fituation by three or four futures by adhefive plaftcrs; and by proper comprcfTcs, re tained with a broad flannel roller palled different time round the body, and fpirally over the flump. Th fubfequent treatment is as in other cafes of amputa tion. Vide Bell’s Surg. vol. vi. and White s Surg. p. 201 Sharpe's Operations of Surgery, ch. xxxvii. Si&rfc Critical Inquiry, ch. vii.

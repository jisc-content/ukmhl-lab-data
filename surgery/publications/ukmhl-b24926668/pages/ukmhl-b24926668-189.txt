F I S drying aftringcnt applications, liable to become id aad callous in its internal furface, and in i'uch a e, from its fuppofed rcfcmblance to a pipe, is, med a fijhda. The moil frequent caufo of finufcs ming in ulcers and abfcellcs, is the want of vent he difcharge, which eafily inllnuates itfelf into foft yielding fubftance of the cellular membrane, I proceeds on gradually till it fomewhere or other Is an opening either externally, or into fome of neighbouring cavities.

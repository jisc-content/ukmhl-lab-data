A N E 1 pears fpinc, it is the fooncft eroded through. A proof that all preflure muft be avoided in all in fiances of this fort. The blood that fills thefe tumours is always fluid, by being conftantly renewed ; that is, as faft as one drop enters another pafTes out, and continues its courfe in the circulation; but, notwithflandingthis blood is fluid, its paffage in the tumour is retarded, and this remifl- ncl's in its motion, which is more or lels confiderablc, according to the fize of the eincurifm, occafions fome of the fibrous parts of the blood to feparatc troin the red part, and adhering to the internal coat of the aneur/fm, it there forms fibrous flrata, which may calily be taken for real membranes by thofc not ac- cuftomed to obferve them. This fibrous flrata can- not be difperfed by any means, cither external or in- ternal, and preflure cannot be ufed, becaule thereby the coats of the artery arc foon deflroycd. > Secondly, of the Falfe Ancurifm. It is formed by a rupture or wound in the coats of the artery, and is of two kinds, viz. the diflulcd and the circumfcribcd. ... - , The diffiifed, is that in which the extravafated blood runs through the cellular membrane, in the intcrfliccs of firmer parts; this generally makes a rapid progrefs, may extend itfelf to a great difiance, and has little or no puliation, except very near the aperture of the artery ; but thcle ctrcumllances will fomewhat vary, according to the fize of the opened artery, and the ftrengrh of the circulation. 'Â» uh regard to the lodgment of the fluid, this fpecies of fal{enuuurifm is analogous to the emphyfema, and is the higheft fpecies of ecchymofis. The circumfcribcd, beats and finks under preflure, like the true aneunfm, and indeed cannot be diflin- guifhed from that, except by the knowledge of i:s taufe, or by a careful difluetion of the part: it ap-

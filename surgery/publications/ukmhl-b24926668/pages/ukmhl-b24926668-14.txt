Tins mat- ter, in circumfcribcd tumours, will occupy the centre j hut, in extended inflammations, we often find many points of fuppuration, which running into one an- other, form large cavities and different finufes in the cellular and adipofe membrane.’'’ The inflammatory heat increafing, during three days, in oppofition to the ufual means, a fuppuration will certainly follow. If the patient complains of frequent fhiverings, a formation of pus is certainly commenced. This lhivering is produced by the sbforption of fomc of the pus, or its thinner parts; but, when the matter is inebfed in a cyft, or lur- roundgd with an inflammatory matter, this ablorp- tion rarely or never happens. In the cellular mem- brane is lodged many vclTels for the iecretton and diftriburion of fat, and many other vcflels pafs througn it in their way from one part to another. 1 his mem- brane cr.fily nullifies, and, being very flight, as cafuy divides, hy which a cavity is formed, and in it is depofited all that conftitutes the fuhlcqucnt difeharge. farther, by the rupture of the cellular membrane, the parts which were connefted are feparated, and their tenfion removed, the many blood-vcffcls, which before were comprcflcd, are freed, the blood circulates Freely, the heat abates, the part is lefs ree, am. gradually becopies more loft. f The nroerefs of an abfcsfs on the external parts of the body, t generally as follows: the tumour, the heat, pain, and rednefs incrcafe; a pul fat ion is all'o perceived, a fever fometimes attends, which i increased every night: when the contents arc at fuppurated, the pricking pam gives way, and an| itching with a growing numbitcG, is complained of the hard net's of Ac part at length yields to the touch and the Ain burfting, gives wut to the contained matter. ^

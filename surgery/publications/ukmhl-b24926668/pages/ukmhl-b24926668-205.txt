In this wav the fra&ured ends re generally replaced ; but if extenfion fliould be eceflary, let one alfiftant grafp the arm between the •adture and the fhoulder, and another above the 'int of the elbow. Then apply a couple of fplints nvered with flannel, or tow covered with old linen, ■me along the whole outiidc of the arm, and the other nn the inl'ide, fccure them with a flannel roller, loderately tight, and fupport the fore-arm in a fling, he bone will unite in about a month ; but the mb fliould not be ufed till about the end of the ixth or feventh week. FraHures of the Bones of the Fore-Arm. The forc- rm has two bone?, viz. the radius and ulna. FraFiurts terc arc difeovered by the fight, touch, and car : by he touch and fight, by moving the hand of the iffected arm inward and outward ; though afradtured ilna, from its inability to fupport the joint, will hew itfelf fooner than that of the radius: the car Jifcovers a grating noife, if the elbow is held ftcady, .nd the hand is moved inward and outward. To re- luce a fracture of either of thefe bones, relax the mufcles of tite.arm by bending the joint of the wrift und'elbow ; and let two alfiflants gently extend the imb, by one grafping above the fradlure, and the other beneath it. The bones replaced, apply a fplint defended with flannel or tow, of fuflreient length o reach from the elbow to the tops of the fingers ; md of 1 uch a breadth as to incafe more than one half bf the arm and hand, along the ulna ; and another not ]uite fo broad in the courle of the radius, and ccure them with a flannel roller, or a twelve tailed aandage, which is preferable; and let the arm hang ii} a fling. In applying the fplints, the palm of the laud inufl be turned towards the bread.

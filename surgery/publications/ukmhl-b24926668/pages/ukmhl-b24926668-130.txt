CAT could not operate with any fuccefs, but if it is im- moveable, oralmoftfo, from a diftenfion of the cryf- talline humour (which Mr. Pott thinks fometimes happens) you may operate; however, in thefe cafes, on a very nice examination, the pupil will be found to have a very fmall degree of motion. The patient ought always to be able to diftinguilh light from dark- nels, and a white from a black body ; if he is not, though you remove the catarai1 from over the pupil, yet the retina is incapable of performing its office. In the following inftances, fuccefs is hardly to be ex- pefted by cither couching or cxtra&ing the cryfta- line body : when the dlfcai’ed cryftalline is fomewhat of the colour of brafs, or of a bright yellow, or of a copper colour, the operation does not fucceed ; the pupil being generally found immoveable, and the whole eye enlarged When all the parts of the eye are enlarged, or when the cryftalline protrudes through the pupil, the cafe is not a proper one for the ope- ration. In extra&ing, Mr. Bell advifes the divifion of the cornea at the upper part, in order to prevent the aqueous humour from being all difeharged ; but this method renders the approximation of the divided parts difficult.

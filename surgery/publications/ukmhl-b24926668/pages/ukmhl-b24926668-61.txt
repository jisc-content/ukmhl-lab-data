A M P rerfely, then fcrape off the perioftcum, and faw through the bone with, the law called the metacarpal aw. Hold the faw very* iteady, and make long Irokes when ufing it. If two bones are to be re- moved, we fhould proceed as above, in general; alfo e mem her to divide the integuments, &c. tranlverlelv letween the two bones, as is done between the tibia nd fibula, or between the radius and ulna in arnfuttn- ions of thofe parts. 1 he tourniquet is not required n this operation. Vide [('bite's Surgery, p. 300. Amputation of the Leg. Jf the leg is to be amputated, though the injury is vcr fo near the ankle, as a long dump is thought tore inconvenient than a fhort one, it is preferred to mputate it at about four or five fingers' breadth below ue tuherofity of the tibia ; if it is cut higher, the ap- oneurotic cxpanfion of the flexor mufcle will be hurt; elides, the flump would be tooihort for an cafy lup- ort on the wooden leg; and an artery which runs sto the thicknefs of the tibia to be diftribtlted to the tar row, would be unneceffarily wounded. As the gaftrocnemei mufcics draw back the (kin tore flrongly than it is drawn elffc where, tt is proper, 1 order to keep the fkin equal after the operation, to it fo that the wound on the calf of the leg is farther om the middle of the ham, than the wound in the >re part is from the middle of the patella. • The tourniquet mull be placed three or four inches iove the patella, and fo as to prefs more particularly the artery in the ham. The operator muff Hand the inlide of the leg, bccaufe the fibula will then lawed at the fame time with the tibia: but if, 1 the contrary, the faw i5 laid on the infide of the ?’ the tibia will be firft divided, and the fibula, mg too weak to bear the force of the faw, will apt to fpiintcr, lo not only render the operation dious, but alio the cure more difficult afterwards. 1' 3 Though

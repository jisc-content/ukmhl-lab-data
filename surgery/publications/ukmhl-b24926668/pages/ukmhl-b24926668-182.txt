ESC previoully cut a hole in them, nearly as hig as the efehar is to be made ; then, in the hole of the plafter, lay the cauftic, which mull be fecured by another piece of ftick ing-plafter: when the Ikin is not in- flamed, the cauitic very often occafions little or no pain. When the cauftic has produced its effect, an opening may be made through it for the difeharge of the pus, but the reft may digeft away. When blues arc made by cauftics, or bones laid bare by them, the efehar muft be immediately removed, or the next day, left new flclh fliould fill up the part which is opened. To lay a bone bare, or to make an ifluc, let the cauf- tic lay on about four hours ; to deftroy a large gland, lay it on fix hours; but to open an abfcel's, it nr.y remain two or three hours, according to the thick- nefs of the lkin; though, generally, when the efiedi of the cauftic is completed, the part on which it is applied ceafes to be uneafy. When a large fungus is to be deftroved by a cauftic, the method deferibed in the Edinb. Med. Effays, feems moft eligible ; it is as follows : the lap. infern, was applied to a tumour on the coats of the teftis; after the reparation of the efehar, tile lap. infern. Sc oh vitr. were alternately ufed, by rubbing the part firft with the lap. infern, then in lefs than a minute after, with a fir ftick dipped in the ol. vitr. which inftantly removed the pain occafioncd by the lap. in- fernalis; at each drefling, this alternate application of thefe oppofitc cauftics was repeated, till as much was wafted as was then thought convenient; the moifturc was abforbed by an armed probe, and a di- geftive applied. This method prevents the continu- ance of pain, and is not productive of any degree of inflammation ; it is alfo recommended for the removal of feirrhus, or any other kind of tumour that admits of a cauftic being made ufe of. Mr. John Hunter recommends a mixture of opium with the cauftics, in order to leflen the pain which they occafion. Exrou

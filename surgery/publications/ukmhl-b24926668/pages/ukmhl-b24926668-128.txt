CAT tion, when the difeafed eye is either diminilhed, or increased, from its natural fize. Before and after the operation, a due regard mult be had to the Hate of the patient’s conftitution ; and fuch means are generally advifed, as will keep it fomewhat below its natural vigour. When no objettion to the operation attends, Mr. Sharp recommends the following method for depref- fing the talaraR. “ Place the patient in a conve- nient light, and a fuitablc height : put a pillow be- hind his back, that his body may bend forward, and the head approach near to you ; then inclining the head a little backwards upon the breaft of your af- fiftant, and covering the other eye, fo as to prevent its rolling, let the afliftant lift up the fuperior eye- lid, and yourfelf deprefs a little the inferior one: this done, ftrike the needle through the tunica con- junftiva, fomething lefs than one-tenth of an inch from the cornea, even with the middle of the pupil, into the puftcrior chamber, and gently endeavour to deprefs the cataraR with the flat furface of it. If after it is diflodged it riles again, though not with much elafticity, it muft again and again be pufljed down. If it is membranous, after the difeharge of the fluid, the pellicle muft be more broke and de- preffcd. If it is uniformerly fluid, or exceedingly claftic, we muft not continue to endanger a terrible inflammation, by a vain attempt to fuccced. After the operation, treat it as an ophthalmy; and a collyrium, of one part rectified fpirit of wine, and ten parts of luke war n water, will be as proper an application as any. When the operation of extrac- tion is determined on, proceed as follows : Pals your knife through the cornea, into the anterior chamber of the eye, about a line before the iris; for if it is not put there, the iris will, per- haps, be wounded : if you go too tar on the cornea, you may get between it> lamina, and fo not perforate • into

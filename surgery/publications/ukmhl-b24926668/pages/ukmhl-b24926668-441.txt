Sometimes the bowels protrude, when a wound esnetrates the cavity of the abdomen. They fhould :e immediately returned : and if the wound is not lfttciently extenfive for this purpofe, it fhould be nlarged. If any fund, duff, or other extraneous tatter is. upon the protruded parts, they fhould be •athed with warm milk or water, before they are returned, but never otherwife.

If the cut is deeper in one part Iphan another, the preffurc muft be fo regulated, as to render it equal, or nearly lo; as foon as the piece is . loofe, take it our with the forceps, and if the lower edge of the perforation is rough, fmooth it with the denticular; this done, raiie the deprefled piece of •fkull with an elevator, which now is made with ful- kcra, to reft on the found bone ; after this, if cxtrava- ffated matter feems lodged under the dura mater, open it with a lancet for its difeharge. When the trephine is ufed on account of a fiflure, it muft be applied fo tas to include part of it, if not diredlly over it, as it is anoft likely that the extravafated blood or lymph will d>e found diredlly under it; and when the filfure is of ra confiderable extent, a perforation muft be made at ■each end, if not more. When fcveral perforations are to be made, in order to the removal of fcveral de- 'prefted fragments of bone that have their internal -furface larger than their external, it is neceffary to apply the trephine as near the fracture'clparts as they \ will admit of, making the perforations adjoining to i'fave the trouble of cutting the intermediate fpaecs ■with the head-faw. In places where the unequal Ifthicknefs of the Ikull is obferved, it is heft to elevate i: the piece that is fawed before it is cut quite through, I 'thus the membrane will be unhurt. When an injury {' happens on'a future, and it is not thought advileable |'to ufe the trephine there, make a perforation on each ;j fide of it.

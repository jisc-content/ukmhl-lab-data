FRA together, when the head is bent down upon'the breaft, and in others, while it is raifed, with the ihoulders. If the fr allure is accompanied with a wound, and there are any fplinters, they muft be removed, but with caution, on account of the vicinity of the fub- clavian artery. The bones are generally united in about a fortnight; but the corrcfponding arm fhould be notufed till the end of the third or fourth week. FtaHuret ‘of ibe Ribs, are difeovered by the feat of the pain, and by preffure of the fingers. In genera), the fymptoms are moderate; but in fomc inftanccs, the pain is fevere from the firll; the breathing is difficult, attended with cough, and fometimes fpitting of blood ; the pulfe is quick, full, and fometimes ‘ opprefled. Thcfe fymptoms, however, only occur when the frallured rib is puffied inwards upon the pleura and lungs. In every cafe of fractured ribs, bleed proportionably to the ftrength of the patient. ' If any inequality is difeovered, let the patient make a deep inipiration, and by equal and moderate pref- j fure, endeavour to replace it ; and to prevent its j rifing, apply a broad flannel roller, or a leather belt, quilted infide, with cotton or flannel, moderately J tight, and let it be worn for fevcral weeks. When I the patient is freely blooded, and kept on a low j regimen, the raoft fevere fymptoms will generally lubfidc. But if the opprefled breathing is kept up j by air cfcaping from a punfhrre in the furface of the I lungs, or by blood dilcharged from a ruptured inter- I coftV.I artery into the chert, or where the pain is con- | tinned by the frallured rib being forced in upon the 8 pleura, an opening muft be made with a fcalpel, 11 dircdlly upon the injured parr, and if a portion of rib is merely forced inwards, elevate the deprefled j parr, with the fingers, forceps, or a fpatuia. When I the fymptoms arife from air or blood in the cavity of I the thorax, proceed as dire&ed in article Empyema. I _ Fxadurti I

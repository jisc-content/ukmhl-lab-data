As an internal medicine when fcorbutic ulcers at- tend, Dr. Kirkland highly recommends the muriatic acid given in water, or mixed with the bark. Mr. Bell, in his Treatile on Ulcers, obierves, that the cure of the fcorbutic kind depends much upon the corre&ion of the putrid diathelis in the fyllein ; for which purpofe, vegetables, particularly the accfctnt ones, with milk jnd whey, arc almoll certain reme- dies. The different fecretions, particularly thole cf the fkin and bladder, fhould be gently promoted. In the feurvv, perl’piration is almolf quite checked.

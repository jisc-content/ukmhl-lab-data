GON * -If the venereal taint gave rife to it, and mercury j has not been ufed, or ul'cd in an undue quantity ; or 1 if there is any fufpicion of any remaining infection, the fafeft method is to begin the cure by a mercurial courfe. If fymptoms of an inflammatory fever appear, j bleeding may fometimes be ufeful; but, in general, ] more fervice will be derived from topical evacuations ' of blood, and from emollient and fcdative fomenta- 1 tions and poultices. Dr. Swediaur obferves, that, on the other hand, when the patient is of a weak and irritable habit of body, the difcharge is very thin and ' copious, attended with violent pains and quick pulfet thecort Peruv. given internally, according to circum- llanccs, with or without opium, is the mod ufeful ; adminillration ; and that opium, given in emollient elyflers, is fometimes particularly ufeful in thefe cafes: it allays or prevents the frequent painful ere&ions, ; the return of which, fliould be prevented as much as ; pollible. To prevent the more violent fymptoms, the pa- ! tient fliould, from the beginning of the difeafe, wear J a bag trufs, or other means, to keep the lcrotum fup- ported and warm. Neutral fait, and other purgatives than thofe which keep the bowels lax, are injurious. When the fymptoms are more exafperated, as when the heat of urine is great, a tendon is perceived in the length of the urethra, the urine is only pafleo by a few drops at a time, erections arc frequent, pains r fliooting through the urethra, ftresks of blood palling with the urine, or other figns of ulceration : in this fituation, betides what is already recommended, mcr- ft curial friftions will be ncccffary along the perinseutn, |) and the inlldc of the thighs. _ The fame treatment will be proper when the *iif- $ charge, during the inflammatory ftage, is fupprefled, <j and a hernia iiumoralis is threatened, or has taken place.

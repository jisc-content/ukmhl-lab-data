1 N F Sometimes an inflammation foon goes off, at others, it is removed with difficulty, and often it terminates in other difeaies. An inflammation can only termi- nate by a removal of its immediate caufe, viz. the ercthifm of the vcfTels, or rather the irritating mat- ter. Bur, generally, it is faid to end in a rcl'olution, a fuppuration, a gangrene, a feirrhus, or a cancer. That the two lalt are the refuit of inflammation, is not univcrfally allowed. Hrjolution, is, when, upon removing the caufe, the fymptoms diminifh gradually ; and at laft the pa- tient is in the fame ftate as before the dil'ordcr began. And, unlcfs morbilic matter was the caufe, this is tiic moft deftrable way of termination. A refolution may be brought about by fome increafed evacuation happening by natureâ€™s efforts, or by thofe of art; a fever coming on ; or by a m< taftalis. But thefe are not properly the modes of the refolution of inflam- mation, but the methods which nature or an hat taken to remove the irritation which was tile imme- diate caufe. In all thefe fpccies of refolution, callo- fuics are fometimes left. Suppuration is more properly a confer]uencc -of in- flammation than a mode of its termination. It hap- pens, when a quantity of blood is thrown out into lomc cavity (the iufl.immatan continuing) it ferment, and is converted into put, which afterward. ..fts as-a ferment on the (olid parrs, and gives occafion for the converfion of the whole into a matter fimilarto itfell, the fytnptoms of inflammation going off. A gang)->:f may be a confcqucncc of inflammation, but never can be confidcrcd as a mode of inflammationk going off; for now fenfatien is deftroyed, and iit< J with refpedt to the part that mortifies, is extinguiflied ; whence no morbid caufe can any longer be produc- tive of effefts.

PRO confulcrablc pain is alfo felt in the loins, about the infertions of the ligatncnta lata. When there is a perverli) uteri, it appears like a piece of fiefh, and when this is the cafe, it is always attended with a procidentia veficae urinsriaa. Girls are fometimes the fubjefts of this difeafe, but it moft frequently happens to women who have had children, in whom it is generally caufed bv hard labour, nr getting cut of bed too loon after d livery, though fometimes it is owing to a weak, relaxed habit. A (hurt funis umbilicalis, and the placenta adhering, may be the caule, particularly if force is ufed in de- livering them. ’i» 3 If any fpecies of this diferder is ncgletted, the woman fuficn much pain, with a difficulty in voiding her urine, and ioinetimes an inflammation, ulcers, or a cancer, will be formed in the womb. In general the cure is only palliative, arid co-fifts of introducing a peflary into the vagina, by which the urerns is kept from falling down any lower; fometi: es this proves a means t.wards a radical cure, by giving the relaxed parts an opportunity Gf re- covering their tone. Sometimes, when a letter de- gree of this diforder has happened, the ufual confine- ment in bed during the next Iving in, has effected a cure ; a pefTary ffiould be introduced as loon as it con- veniently can, after delivery being completed, and worn fqr fomc time after the woman walks abroad. A round peflary is the belt, and Jho . ! be • > !r . «■ a* to occafion fomc uncafincfs in p illing it up, or it w ill be apt to fall down again. It a lacerated perineum is the caufc i f the womb bearing down, a peflary will net be very ufefttl ; in this calc, a fort ol culhiou may be placed with is convex lido to the os externum, and fccuted there by the t bandage. It the pn'lap- fus has been long neglcdfed, lo that a lwclling and inflamm:.; ion is come on upon the part, bleed, keep the bowels open, and apply fomentations and poul- tices.

rdges of the eve-lid?, is fituatcd a number of fmall gland?, feercting a lei aecous fluid, which is excreted by a row of duffs opening immediately on the inner edges of their border. Thefc duffs, and fometimes the glands thcml'elvcs, appear to be the parts princi- pally affetted ; and the fluid which is fecrctcd by tiitm, inftcad of being moift and mild, ftrving as a defence again ft the acrimony of the tears, is changed into a (harp, acrid, and adhefive humour, which caiifc- a con (fan t irritation of the eye and eye-lids, ulcerates the jnner edges of tire latter, and, for want of proper attention, has often perpetuated the dis- order for a great number of years. M. St. Yves ob» ferves, in bis chapter on the ophthalmv, fubfequent to the fmall-pox, that “ the puftules on the edge of the cartilage of the eye-lids, which penetrate between the cilia, and their inner furfacc, do not cicatrize, by reafon of the acrimonious ferofity which inccffantly humeefs the eye; hence follow ulcers, which laft fometimesfeveral years, and even during life, if they arc not remedied.” But though the lmall-pox and meafles, are frequent caufcs of this complaint, they are not the onlv ones; an inflammation of the globe of the eye, in itlclf but lmall, will fometimes affeft the lids, fa as to caufe them to fwcli, and become red ; in confequcncc of wt)ich, there will be an adhefiott of one to the ether, and often an univcrlal ulceration of their edges. The fmall puftules, alf-, which form on the outer mar in of the ciliary edge, whore the lalhes grow, and arc known by the name f ftyes, have, in fomc inftanecs, brought on an i flammation, which has been cmtinueJ to the febacejus glands and produced all the confequences abov c dclcriocd. 1 bis difordcr is often fpokeu of as fymptomatic, and the effed of ferophula, feurvy, or lues venerea; but it is verv often, if not nnft frequently, a local coni- t’laint; it cannot be known to be any other, except ly liich fymptoms a* mark the prciencc of' rhefe dif* orders.

— V U L Wounds which penetrate the Cavity of the T'borax. The firftobjedt here is to check the haemorrhage from we intercoftal artery, which in thin people, may be one by drawing it out with a tenaculum, and apply- >fg a ligature but where this cannot be done, pafs 1 ligature round the rib, and with it, tie a dollil of :n;t upon the bleeding artery. This done, the air, ;thieh has rufhed into the wound, mull be expelled j which end, defire the patient to make a full in- spiration flowly, and inftantly draw the fkin over the are. Now bring the lips of the wound exaftly to- gether, and fecure them in that fituation by flips of dhefive plafters, and proper bandages. In this way hel'c wounds will often heal. Sometimes an opprel- ion of breathing comes on, either from a quantity ;>f blood having been thrown out, or from a colledlion of pus* If the fymptoms are moderate, we Ihould rru£k to the fluid being abforbed; bur, otherwife, an opening muft be made.

Emphyfematous fwcllings in the contiguous teguments, the quantity of blood dif- ctharged being confiderablc, its being of a deeper reel than common, and frothy, alio a dil'chargc of blood ffrotn the mouth, indicates a wound in the lungs, lit Ihould be obferved, that emphyfematous fwellings unay arife, without the lungs being wounded, as they tsiay be formed by the external air palling between tthe lungs and the pleura. There are but few in- stances of the lungs healing with eafe and fafety. Tocheckthe hatmorrhage, bleed the patient till faint- ing is induced ; keep him in a cool apartment, in a per- fect ftate of quietude •, direft cooling laxative medi- ccines, and low diet. If abfeefies form in the fub- : Aancc of the lungs, the treatment muft be as direfted .in article Vomica Puj.monum. Vide Bell's Sur- igery, vol. v. Whichfoever

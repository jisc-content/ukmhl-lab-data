H Y D Hydrocele, from dJuy, water, and a tumour Is when water is in the contents of ruptures, buf part cularly is applied to a dropfy in the ferotum, called alio bydrops tiftis, and hernia aquofa. Dr. Cullen places this genus of difeafe in the clafs cachexia, anc order mtumejeentue. There are two kinds : the firft is when the water is lodged in the cells of the membrana cellularis fcro- t:, but this is generally a ivmptom of an anafarca The fecond, and only proper fpecies, is formed By water lodged within the tunica vaginalis of the tef tide. The firft is known by pits remaining for : time where it is imprefled by the finger: the fecond is not fubjedt to this accident. The caufe, when not anafarcous, is a preternatu- ral difeharge of that water, which is continually fc- parating on the internal furface of the tunica vagina- lis, for the moiftening, or iubricating the tefticle. From the time of its firft appearance, it is feldom known to difappear, or diminilh, but generally con- tinues to increafc, though in fome much faftcr that in others. In one, it grows to a painful degree of diftenfion in a few months ; in another, it continue! many years, with little difturbance. As it enlarges, it becomes more tenfc, and is fometimes tranfparcnt, fc that if a candle is held on the oppefite fide, a de- gree of light is perceived through the whole bulk of the tumour; but the only pofitive way of knowing that a fluid is the contents, is to feel for the fluctua- tion, or to difeover that the diftenfion of the tunica vaginalis is the caufe of the tumour, and not an hernia of the omentum, or inteftines, or fomc,other difordcr of the part. The hydrocele inuft be diitinguifhcd from an herni' of the abdominal contents, an hernia humoralis, ant a farcocrle. In order to the cure, if the water is lodged onl_y in the cellular membrane, fcarifications may bo mate

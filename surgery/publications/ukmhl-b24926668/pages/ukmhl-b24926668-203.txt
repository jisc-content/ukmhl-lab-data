FRA I 'failures Frafiures of the Sternum, fhould be con fide red in the Tame light with fimilar injuries to the ribs. The (ymptoms arc the fame, and if they do not yield to copious bleedings, and the antiphlogiftic regimen, an textenfive incifion rauft be made, and the dcprclTcd [.part raifed, by a fcalpel or a levator; if there be an ! opening, that will admit an inftrument; if not, an oopening may be made with the trepan. The prac- tice of laying the patient over a barrel or drum is [idangerous, by prelfing the lungs with additional force againft the depreffed portion of bone. After the ( operation, the fore mult be treated in the ufual way. IThe operation Ihould be performed with great t caution. Fraftures of the Vertebra. When any of the vertebrae are fradtured, without affedting the fpinal marrow, then there are only the ppofterior apophyfes, or acute tubercles injured, and they are not dangerous. When thefe parts only are Tradtured, replace them with your fingers, and apply on each fide the fpina dorfi, narrow compreffes moiftened with fpirit of wine, and fecure them- with palteboard fplints, and the napkin and l'capuiary. Fraflures in thefe parts are eafily known by the pain there, as alio on llightly touching them. If the tranfverfc apophyfes which tend towards the cavity of the thorax are broken, then the heads of the ribs which are inferted into them will likewife be broken, and much danger attends this cafe. When the body of a vertebra is broken, th.e fpinal marrow is injured; then the parts of the arms, vifccra, or legs, which arc below them, become im- mediately motionlefs, and death is fooner or later the confequcncc. In this cafe, lay the injured part bare, elevate the fragments which prefs the medulla, and if loofe, extract them ; then treat the wound in the ufual way.

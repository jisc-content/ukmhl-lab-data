CAT i.. chord which is to be divided. Cut the chord acrols at this part, and remove the tefticle, by differing the chord and it from above downwards. The difeafed parts being removed, untie the knot upon the chord to dif- cover the fpermatic artery and vein, and fccure them, taking care to leave out the nerve, which may be fepa- rated by the tenaculum, but when it cannot, it muft be included in the ligature.—For the drefiing, Mr. Bell advifes a quantity of foft lint, laid into the bottom of the fore, a comprcfs of linen laid over it, and the whole fecurcd with the T bandage, or fufpenlbry bag. My practice has uniformly been to bring the lips of the wound together by the interrupted future j cover it with a drelfing of wax and oil, and fccure it with the T bandage, or fufpenfory bag. The pa- tient being put to bed, an opiate Ihould be given, and every means to keep down inflammation muft be em- ployed. When the lkin of the ferotum is in a Rate of ul- ; ceration, or fo diftended as not likely to recover its rone, fuch part muft be removed in the operation. But then, inftead of a longitudinal incifion along the courfc of the tefticle, the firft incilion ought to com- mence at the under extremity of the fpermatic chord; from whence two femilunar incifions ought to be con- tinued to the under part of the ferotum, and made to include all the parts of the lkin, that are in any de- gree difeafed. The remainder of the operation is as already deferibed. Vide Sharpe's Operations. Le Dean's Operations and his 74th Obf. Hcijler's Sur- gery, and Bill's Surgery, vol. i.

1 N F It often happens after abortion, and child-birth, cfpccially when the lochia arc prevented by cold, or other caufe, and is then attended with fymptoms dif- ferent from thofe which appear when an uterus not lately impregnated is inflamed. In the firlt cafe, there is a pain at the bottom of the belly, which for the moll part is neither throb- bing nor conllantly acute ; the pull'c is frequent, ef- pecially after child-birth, often l'mall, fometimes ir- regular ; in ftrong habits, and after early abortions, hard ; the patient is affedted with delirium, a fubfitl- tu:j tendinum, and the other fymptoms of irritation ; the womb gangrenes and mortifies, and thy patient finks. In the fecond, the pain is more conllant, bounded, and throbbing; the pulfc is hard, full, and ftrong, and other fymptoms of general inflammation attend ; or if the difeafe riles to a greater height, the pulfe is fmall and frequent, the fymptoms of ir- ritation attend, and fuppuration is more liable to happen. In both, as different parts of the womb are affedl- ed, there is a ftrangury, or a fupprclfion of urine; the little that is discharged is foetid and hot, or a tc- nefmus attends, with a pain in going to ftool ; or there is pain in moving the lower extremities, or fuelling, with heat, to be felt by introducing a finger up the vagina, the os tinea; being lhut; univcrfal roll - lriTncfs, thick urine, pain upon external preflurc, the belly is tenfc, a red (lain extends up to the navel, and turns black when fatal; and if it happens in an impregnated uterus, an abortion follows. It often happens, that the woman can only lie on her back, and on turning to either fide, flic feels a painful heavy mafs fail to that fide, and at the larrtc time, an cxcelfive pain in the loins kidnies, and groin, of the oppofite fide. rI lie pains excited by inflammation in the womb, fometimes extend to the in fide of thighs when the woman turns on her !ide, or it is felt in the loins.

is fpnimodicaljy atflpfed; and, generally, the intro* duPtion of a bougie will incrcafc the: fpalvn, produce a fliivering, and then a fever fit; all which will re- turn as often as the bougie is introduced; and the tiifeafe to be relieved will become preportionabiy ob- ftinate. Yet, if the bougie is introduced without pain, and the patient difeharges his urine more freely, its ule may be continued. If there is inflammation in the neck of the bladder, • ; the catheter cannot be ufed before the inflammation abates; diuretics cannot conveniently be admitted; here nitrous medicines, neutral fait?, the aciduvn j muriat. diluted in the patient’s common drink ; and fmall doles of'camphor, may be frequently given. Deceptions 'of parfley roots, with a little nitre, may be drank in proportion as the thirft requires ; and bladders of warm water may be applied to the pubes and perinseum, or to the region of the kidnies, if the inflammation is there ; and fuch other medicines as are recommended in the nephritis. Ulecdiqg’ is here a principal remedy, and as a laxative the lai cath,. ahiar. or the ol. ricini ver. may be ufed. If a (tone obtfruPts the neck of the bladder, or the urethra, pufli it back with "the catheter, or cut through the perineum, and there cxiraPt it. Some advife never to ufe the catheter in retentions of urine fiom any caufc but from a -calculus obftruPling it> pnflage. But though this advice may be too general, the u(e of this inftrument is rarely required. When the head of tiic child, in pregnant women,' obflruPls the pafiage of the urine, introduce a linger into the vagina, and pufli back the child's head until a due evacuation is made. When acrid urine is the caufc, emullions made with the ok ricitr, fliould be the common drink. Nitre mixed in oily draughts, aiul mucilaginous de- coctions, arc the proper remedies. Spnftns

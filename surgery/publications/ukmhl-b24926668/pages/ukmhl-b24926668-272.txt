I N F ing and burning pain is perceived in theregion of the bladder above the pubes, and in the pcrin.eum; lomeumes a reduefs is perceived in thefe parts, though the pain is deep i'cated. It the neck be the part af- fe&ed, there is a retention of urine, with a conftant ft unulus in its evacuation ; if the fundus be the part dilculed, there is a continual dribbling, with great efforts to throw out a larger quantity at a time, which the patient conceives to be contained in the bladder. Frequent attempts to expel fatces, with which the rectum appears to the patient to be always leaded; thefe increafe the pain very much, particularly whin nny fa-ccs arc actually contained, and efpecially jif they arc hard. The puli'c is frequent and hard, and ihe extremities are cold : there is great anxiety, reft- leffncfs, ficknefs, vomiting, delirium, and other fymp- nms of irritation. This, dborder ufuaily tenninates foon, cither in a recovery or death ; frequently the latter. A gan- grene comes on, by which the pain is removed ; but the other fymptoms continue until death. This dilordcr mav pafs off by an incrcafcd fecretior of mucus from the internal membrane, or by a me- tafia fir, or by fuppuration ; in which laft cafe th( matter may be dilcharged into the cavity of the blad der, and pal's oft' with the urine; or in the cellula membrane, and lb pal's externally through the pert n eum ; or laftly, into the cavity of the abdomen where it proves fatal. The ulcer in the biadder am per neeum are difficult of cure. Infianvnaiir-n in the external coat of the bladder Ihould be diftinguiihcd from that of the internal and in any part of the bladder Ihouldb diftinguiihcd from ixfuin.nation in the adjacent part alfo from that retention of urine which proceeds frot other caufes. I n order to the cure, bleed according to the ftrcngt of the patient, aud the violence of the lymptoms. i Rclaxsu >

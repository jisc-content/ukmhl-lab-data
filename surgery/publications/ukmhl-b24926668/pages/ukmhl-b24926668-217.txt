G O N orrhoeas, and from gleets, to which latter he gives le name blennorheota, muajiuxuspnj/ivus, i. e. without jlogijhc fymptomi. Some reckon three fpecics of this diforder: ift, A inple gonorrhoea., alfo called a benign gonorrhoea, and gleet. 2dly, A virulent or venereal gonorrhoea ; nproperly l'o called, from its refemblance to the pre- eding. 3dly, An involuntary efflux of a whitifh .uid from the urethra, in confequence of a venereal tononbcea. Dr. Cullen places this genus of dil'cafe in te clal's localeand order apocawfes. He diftin- '.ui flies four fpecies : i.

Dr. Swcdiaur well obferves, that the virulent goner- haea is a local inflammation, attended with the dif- harge of a puriform matter from the urethra in mm, U 3 and

PER word degree, a gangrene is formed. Dr. Cullcft places this dil'ordcr as a variety of the pblogojii try - tbenia. The principal methods of prevention and relief arp* to render the Ik in id's tender, and more firm; to guard againft change of weather, by fuitable cover- ing ; to corredi the vicious quality of the tempera- ment, and according to the different degrees of the complaint when prefent, the lubfcquent applications are made ufo of. When winter approaches, let the parts ufually aff.cted be frequently put into cold water, avoiding .every occafion of fubjedfing them to warm.

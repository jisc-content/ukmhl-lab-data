CAT M 2 tion, When a cataraft begins, the patient at firft com- plains of a diminution of fight, and on a careful exa- mination of the eye, a whitenefs is perceived very ideep in it. On examining the eye at diftant periods af time, its opacity is more manifeft, and the patient vrery fenfibly lofcs the advantages of fight. The pro- rrefs of a catarafl, is ufually very flow. No medi- cines feem adequate to the removal of this difeafe, rxcept in an incipient ftate ; fuccefs has fometimes at- I ended repeated dofes of calomel, and poultices of ; re£h hemlock on the eye, while a difeharge was con- stantly kept up by blifters on the back.

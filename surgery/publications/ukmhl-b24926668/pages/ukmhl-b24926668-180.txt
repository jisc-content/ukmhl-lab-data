E R Y atcly becomes delirious, with a highly flufiica vifagCj and very quick fparkling eyes ; foon "after, lie proves frantic, and goes off in a lethargy. If the lungs are attacked, the anxiety and heat are inexpreffible. There are fome conftitutions fubjeft to a very fre- quent, and, as it were, an habitual tryftpelas. If it often aft'edis the face, it is generally repeated on the fame fide of it, and that eye is at length confiderably weakened by it. The eryjipelas fliould be diftinguifhed from the plague, and from inflammations of different kinds that happen on the fkin.

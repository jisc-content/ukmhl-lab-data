Mr. Cruik- Ihank fays, that he formerly conlulcrcd them as be- longing to the patella ; and that, like the offa trique- tra in the flcull, they owed their origin to diftindt points of offification. But having fincc found one , entirely cartilaginous, and another which, though1 hone covered by cartilage, was formed on the lower end of the femur, and this convinced him of his mif- * rake. In the laft mentioned cafe, Mr. Crttikfhank lays, that there wa; a cavity in the lower end of the femur, correfponding to the loofe bone, flicwing that they had been connected with one another ; though, as both furfaccs were nearly fmooth, the manner o! their

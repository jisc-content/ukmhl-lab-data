or no the bone is carious : upon fcraping away this CAR â€˜ft v: cut: the difference betwixt this and the carnous caries is, that in the latter the fpongy flefh grows out of the caverns while the grey or brown coloured fpongy bony Tides of them ftill remain ; but in the former, the bony fibres dii'appear wherever the fpongy flefh comes, fo that we can fcarce determine by the probe whether bone-confuming flefh, the furface of the bone appears rough indeed, but not much eroded, nor greatly altered in its colour. The fcrophulous caries: this is fome- times obferved when an abfcefs is opened ; the bone at the bottom of it appears white and fmooth, without its periofteum or connexion to any of the neighbouring parts, except by its ligaments at the extremities ; and this way of bones mortifying moll commonly happens in fcrophulous habits. The fcirrho-cancrous caries: in one fpecies of exoftofis the tumefied bone is fofter in one part than in another, and is not compofed of regu- lar fibres, nor cavernous, but as if the offifying juice had been thrown out irregularly ; over which a cartila- ginous or tendinous fubftance is fpread, and from this a firm fhining fmooth flefh grows out, which, after the teguments are moved, fends forth a thin (linking acrid fanies; the patient complains often of throbbing pains in it, and fometimes confiderable haemorrhages arc made from imperceptible veflfels in its furface. The fpreading cancrous canes: in the fpreading eating can- ters, the bones are wafted, 83 well as the foft parts, md the appearances are the fame in both, unlefs that the bones do not confume quite lb faft.

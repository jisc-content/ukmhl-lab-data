T R I Sometimes there are inftances, in which none of :hc above methods will l'urfice ; as, where the ciliary edges are not only inverted, but likewife contracted upr lhortened in their length. In this cafe, the cir- cumference of the ciliary edges mult be enlarged -ither by an incifion at the outer angle, or by a com- plete divifion of the cartilage, called tarfus, in the aniddle. The firit of thcle operations, is no more han a fimplc Itraight incifion, which may be made vitli a lharp-pointed curved biftoury. The laft, vhich is l’eldom necelfary, will be belt performed iy the fame inltrument ; only obferving, that the point be carefully introduced between the globe and vyc-lid, and carried below the cartilage (that is •bout ^ of an inch ;) whence it is to be pulhed out- vard in a horizontal direction, till it has cut its way hrough the lid. The cartilage being thus entirely livided, each portion will recede towards the angles, .nd a feparation be left betweeu them, which will lot only take off the complaint at prefent, but pre- ent its return for the future.

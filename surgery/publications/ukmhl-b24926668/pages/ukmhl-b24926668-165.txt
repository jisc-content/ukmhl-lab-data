D Y S The patient ffiould drink pentifully of a folu'tinn of :?um arabic, or fuiop, of whey, or of a decodtion of unarlh-mallow rcor. When the pain is violent, let the mucilage of gum urabic, or lcine oily matter, be injected into the ure- thra before dilcharging the urine. If there are caruncles in the urethra, bougies ffiould be carefejlly- introduced, and repeated as re- quired. In the chronic tl-f'tty, after other means fail, a fali- ■ ration, excited by the tile of mercury, has fucceeded ; and an iffue in the inlide of one thigh, a little above -he knee, pretents the return, or at lealt renders re- apfes very eafy. When the patient is too weakly to tdmit nf fulivarion, a dofe of the uva urli may be aken every morning, and after it half a pint of ii'me, water, mixed with a llrung decodtion of the great water dock root. Dr. Perciva! obferves, that there is a fpecies of chronic dyfurv, to which perfons of an arthritic or fcor.butic habit, and w bo have paffed the meridian of ife, are peculiarly incident.

But the patients who labour under it, feel no uncafy weight in the perinaeum, and ihvays void their warer with much lefs difficulty in an eredf, than in an horizontal pefturc. The complaint, ilfo, may be further diftinguifhtd from the (lone, by I'baving thorter intervals ol calc j by more frequently J I injuring the retentive power of the bladder, and by j joccafioning no ludden interruption to the ft ream of l j urine in the abl'ence of pain.

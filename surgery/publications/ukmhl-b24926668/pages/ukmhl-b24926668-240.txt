HER the patient on its being removed. The whole body is fubjedt to this difordcr, but it moft frequently ap- pears on the loins, bread, perinseum, ferotum, and groins. The herpes exedens difeovers itfclf on any part of the body, but moflly about the loins, where it fome- times fpreads to fuch a degree as to extend quite round the waift. At firft, it ufually appears in the form of fcveral fmall ulcerations, collcdled into larger fpots of different furs and of various figures, with al- ways more or lefs of an eryfipelatous like inflamma- tion. Thcfc ulcerations difeharge large quantities of a thin, iharp, ferous matter, which fometimes forms into finall crufts that in a fhort time fail off; but moft frequently the difeharge is fo thin and acrid, as to fpread along the neighbouring parts, and there to { produce the fame kind of fores. Though thefe ex- coriations or ulcers, do not in genera! proceed further than the true fkin, yet fometimes the difeharge is fo ; very penetrating and corrofivc, as to deftroy the fkin, the cellular membrane, and, on fume occafions, the mufclcs themfelvcs. Dr. George Fordyce fpcaks of an inftancc of this difeafe, under the name of herpes rapiens; and fays, it arifes upon the head in finall ulcers, covered with a brown inoift cruft, and fhining, but fimilar to venereal ulcers. He adds, its cure is the fame as for the vene- real ulcers, which fee. In the cure of thefe various cuticular difeafes, it lias been generally believed to be unfafe, and even dangerous, to proceed in any other way, than by cor- recting the original diforder of the fluids, which was fuppoled to produce them. It may occafionally hap- pen, that fomc difordcr in the general habit is attend- ant on any of thefe ulcerous complaints, and that a regard thereto may be required; but in the greateft number of inftanccs, they are more certainly and more fpeedily removed bv the ufe of loc<d remedies merely.

PER ^1 Pnnffure cf the Parinecum. This is an r.pcra'rm for luch a fupprctlion of urine, as cannot be relieved bv any gentler method. Various modes have keen propnlcd for procuring a difeharge from the bladder ; vide article /jc uric; but pun during the bladder nloeee the /■!■/■■,or from the periiucum, are the only two methods now employed. If the opening into the bladder is to be made above the pubes, the bed fituation for entering the perfo- rating inftrumenr, is about an inch or an inch and a half above the fymphvlis of the pubes. It is recom- mended to nlake an incifion of about tw'o inches in length, through the common teguments and mufcles, and then perforate the bladder with a trocar. But, perhaps, as Mr. Bell obferves, this divifion of the teguments is unncccfiary, as the trocar may at once be pufhed through the (kin, mufcles, and bladder. As foon as the trocar has entered the bladder, with- draw the ftil. tic, and fccure the canula in its fitua- tion, by pieces of ribbon or tape conncffcd with it, and palled round the k dy of the patient. A piece of cork ought to be fitted to the canula, that the. urine may pafs off at proper intervals only. In cor- pulent people, a trocar, with a canula of two inches J.ng, is necelfary ; but in others, the inftrument lhould be half an inch fhortcr. The canula fliould be taken out and cleaned every two or three days; but previous to withdrawing it, a firm probe of a fuf- ficient length ought to be palled through it into the bladder, upon which it may be again returned with cafe and fnfety, as foon as it is properly cleared of the incrufiation.

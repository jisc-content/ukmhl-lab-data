FRA bone, and moli frequently appears in fradtures of the leg, is owing to the inferior portion being dragged out of its lunation by the weight of the foi.'t, ar,d the contradlion of the mufclcs on the back part of t);c. leg. This • mud endeavour to raife, and then fup-i port it ir‘‘ u fituation ; but never apply bandages’to keer dow he fuperior portion, as it never riles out of its natural fituation. rrafhtres of the Bones of the Foot and Toes, are dif- tinguilhcd like fradtures in any other parts. The treatment is the fame as in f milar injuries to the hands and fingers. Compound Fraflures, May be produced by the external violence which fradtured the bone, and by the bones, in cafes of fimple fradtures, pufhing through the integuments; but however produced, the confequences relulting from them, are nearly fimilar. The admilfion of air to the fradture, adds confiderably to the rilk attending it, The firft objedt in compound fradtures, is to reftrain the haemorrhage, by the tourniquet. The next is to confidcr, whether you can attempt to fave the limb, or whether you will proceed to immediate amputation. Some practitioners confider amputation indiipenlably neceflary ; while Mr. Biiguer, of Berlin, fays it ii fcarcely ever requifite. Mr. Bell fays, he is convinced it Ihould never be advifed in private pradtice, unlcfi the bone is greatly lhattcred, or the furrounding fofl parts completely deftroved, but in the navy and army, he thinks the limb Ihould be immediately amputated When amputation is not performed immediately,.01 foon after the injury is received, it is not admilfible for fevcral days. Afterwards it may be neceflary, ill, from haemorrhages, that the tourniquet can- not check, nor the arteries be readily fecured by ligatures ; rdly, from extenfive mortification ; anc jdly, when the bones do not unite, and the patiun

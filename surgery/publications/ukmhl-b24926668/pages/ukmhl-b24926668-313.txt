m a r ad very languid, the volatile alkali, and confe£tlo romatica may be preferibed at the fame time. With ic bark, the vitriolic acid may be employed with iivantage ; the patient’s drink may be acidulated nth it. The external application of the warm gums and ■.alfams, ardent fpirits, or other medicines called rtifeptics, are prejudicial; the incifions alfo direfted i be made to facilitate the operation of thefe medi- •ines, may likewife do harm. All the advantages to c derived from external applications, may be ob- tined, by the ule of any gently ftimulating embro- ation, fuch as a weak folution of fal ammoniac in anegar and water, in the proportion of a drachm of re lalt, to two ounces of vinegar, and fix of water, i'he degree of ftimulus can be augmented or dimi- ifhed, by ufing a larger or fmallcr portion of the dt. Whenever the mortification runs deep, it is smetimes of fervicc to make fcarifications into the lifeafed parts, fo as to remove a portion of them. Be arcful not to carry the incifions the length of the aund parts. When a reparation is completely effetted, treat it ■> a fimpic ulcer, with flight eafy drcllings, and l'up- orr the ftrength of the lyftcm, by wine and gcnc- aus diet. In mortifications fcated on the extremities, and enetrating to the bones, deftroying the whole fur- Dunding loft parts, amputation is often necefiary. lowever, in general, amputation fliould not take lace, until a reparation of the mortified part from re lound is perceptible. But as foon as this l'epara* on has occurred, no time lhould be unneceffarily loft 1 having recourfe to the operation ; for fo long as any f the corrupted parts remain in contaft with the )und, the fyltem mull ftill be fuffering by the con- ant abforpuon of the putrefeent particles.

P s o The venereal itch requires the ufc of mercurial alteratives, and the dcco&ion of guaiacum. Vide Biffs Efiays; Turner on the Dileafcs of the Skin; Philttf. Tranf. Ahr. vol. iv. and Bc(l on Ulcers. Psoas, tcu, Li'mbokum Abscessus. Pfoas% or Lumbar Abfctfs. This abfeefs receives different ap- pellations from different writer'. Mr. Pott obfeeves, that it receives this name from the matter of its Hiding in its fail upon the tide of the pfoas mufelc, or be- twixt that and the iliacus internus. Dr. G. Fordyce fays, that between the pfoas mulcle and the mufcle of the back, lies a quantity of lool'c cellular mem- branes, in which an inflammation often takes place, which, terminating in an abfeefs, forms this diforder. Mr. Pott thinks this diforder originates in the lymphatic glands, near the receptaculum chyli, the vertebrae about which arc generally difeafed and ca- rious in thefe cafes. Mr. Abernethy thinks, that the the pfoas abfeefs being connected with, and often producing a caries of the bodies of the vertebrae, is too prevalent an idea. Becaufe the cellular fubfhnco between the peritonaeum and the loins is the common feat of this abfeefs, and as the peritonxum would readily yield to matter collected behind it, the pref- fure of the collcdted pus againft the 'bones would be infufficicnt to produce the difeafe. Dr. Hunter again obferves, that matter is fometimes lodged in this part at the' crifis of a fever, and he has fecn inftances of matter proceeding fpom the liver into this iitua* tion, after making its way through the peritoneum. As there is a great quantity of cellular membrane over the pfoas inulcle, and a confiderable way toward the fit in. the matter feldom points outwardly on the back, where it is formed, but running down on the courfc of the mufcle, makes its wav into the gr in, thigh, ham, the inner condyle of the os ieinorifi, tkc.

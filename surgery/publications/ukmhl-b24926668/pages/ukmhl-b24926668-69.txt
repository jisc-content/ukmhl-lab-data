A N E pears foon after the accident which gave rife :o it, and is comm- ..ly flow and gradual in its progrcfs. It happens when the orifice in the artery is very mall, l'o that the blood flows but leifurely, and finds he adjacent membranes lb firmly united as to keep it vithin a certain channel. It confifts of one bag with i fmooth infide, and communicates by an aperture vith the cavity of the artery. This fpecies of uuurifm is, perhaps, the mod common among thole hat happen in the arm after bleeding, cfpecially when confiderablc prciTure has been made ufe of inline- iiatcly after the accident. Thirdly, of the Mixed Aneurifm. This is formed partly by a wound or rupture in lie artery, and partly by a dilatation of the reft. It annot ealily be diftinguilhed from the circumlcribed aecics of the falfe aneitriftn, and will often l'o emu- ite the true one, as not to be diftinguilhed from it ut by a careful diflfection. ourtbly, of the Fancofe Aneurifm, or the Ancwifmtd Farix. This is when there is an anaftomofis, or an imme- iate communication between the artery and the vein f the part where the patient has been let blood, in infequence of the artery being wounded through the ein, lb that blood palfes immediately from the trunk ' the artery into the trunk of the vein, and fo back Â» the heart. This fpecies differs from the common fpurious teurifm is one circumftancc only, viz. the wound re- aming open in the fide of the vein as well as in the le of the artery. But this one circumftance will cafion a great difference in the fymptoms, the ten- -ncy of the complaint, apd in the proper method of eating it. Dr.

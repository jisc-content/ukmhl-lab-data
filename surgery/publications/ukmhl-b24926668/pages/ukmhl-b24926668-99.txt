erablc accumulation of fluids in thcfc facs, attended irith much pain. The fuelling yields to preffure, but i more elaftic, than where ordinary matter is contained. The fkin always retains its natural colour, unlefs it be -.tacked with inflammation. When thefe tumours arife Prom rheumatifm, the aments are commonly thin. But when from fprains, aere are a number of final 1 firm concretions in the aid. When thefe concretions are foft, they may be ftinftly felt beneath the fingers, on examining the imour. Tire cure for thefe collections, when they 'occed from rheumatifm, is generally obtained, by ecping the parts warm with flannel; by frequent fric- ons, by warm water frequently pumped on them, or y the application of blifters. When they arife from trains, and from their fize become troublcfome, the aly'chance of relief, is by opening the fac, and kcep- ig :t open, till the wound fills up with granulations •om the bottom. When the contiguity of tendons re vents their being opened to their full extent, Mr. eli recommends to lay them open at each end, and her prefling out their contents, to pals a fmall feton, r chord, from one opening to the other.

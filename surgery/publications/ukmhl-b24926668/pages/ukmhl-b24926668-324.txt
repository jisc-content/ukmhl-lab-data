O P H - follows, and the next day, the inflammation it much abated or gone. Opium is (aid, by fome, not to eafe jvtin in the eye ; but that this fymptom is relieved by the external ufc of aloes; however, it is dear from experience, that ('mall quantities of opium, mixed with any cooling liniment, fpeedily abates inflamma- tion in this organ. Mr. Ware ftrongly recommends a few drops of the tinft. opii. Ph. L.ond. to be dropped into the eye, once every day. I have long adopted this practice with lingular fuecefs. Dr. Kirkland obferves, with refpeft to it, that “with due pcrfeverance, it ftrfficienriy anfwers our inten- tion, where it can polliblv do fervice, without occa- fioning pain. It may be ufed with advantage where the fen Ability in the beginning is often exquifite, and few other remedies can be applied without giv- ing offence.” When a corroding acrimony is ob- fc-r"cd in the humour that is difeharged, the eye may now and then le walhed with a thin folution of gum arabic ; or the mucilage of quince Iced. It the eye remains very weak, after tire inflammation abates, the belt application is a folution of alum in the pro-- portion of a dram to hair a pint of water, with the Peruvian bark internally ; and to linifli the cure, tUc patient may bathe in the fca, >>r cold water may be poured upon his head every morning for l'orac time. When films attend, or arc followed by defluxions tar the eyes, or when the tranfparcncv of the cornea is diminilhed, borax proves an admirable means of • / relief, and may be ufed as follows : R Itoracis opt. | gfs. faccli. alb. 3], aq. rofar. Jij. nr. f. collyr. Let a little of this be frequently dropped into the affedted | e ve.

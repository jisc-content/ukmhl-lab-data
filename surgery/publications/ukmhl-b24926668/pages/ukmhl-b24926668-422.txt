The granulations pufh forward too quickly and too far, if they are not prevented by art, which is always neceflary to be done, until the dil'eafed part of the bone is either caft off by natqre’s procefs, or cut out by the furgeon, fo that the cure may take place with certainty, from the bottom of the fore. And when ncglctted for any confide, rable time, thefc foft productions in carious ulcers frequently increafe fo remarkably as to form very large and troublefome excrefcences. Thefe appear- ances happen whether a portion of the bone, or its whole fubftance, is carious. When the whole bone is affected, the progrefs and its various fymptoms are more rapid, and the whole bone mull be removed; whereas, when a part of the bone only is affeCted, perhaps a Angle lamina, to the extent of the difealed f>art, is all that will be feparated and removed. So ong as the caries remain, it effectually prevents the ulcer about it from healing ; if by chance it appears to be healed, it foon breaks out again. When a probe can be introduced at any opening, to reach the bone, if a roughnefs of its furfacc is difeovered, the cafe becomes then altogether evident. Though the bone cannot be reached by the probe, for waut of an opening, the appearances of the ulcer, and the kind of difeharge, will rarely fail to determine what kind the ulct.r is of; for if the bone is carious, the ulcer is flabby, and inftead of a regular furfacc, the new granulations fprout up in different cluftcrs, of the lize of fmall nuts, and inftead of a healthy ftrong ap- pearance, have ufually a dark brown complexion > the difeharge is thin, dark-coloured, and grealy, there is alfo more or lefs of the peculiar faetor above named. Before this ulcer can be cured, the carious part of the bone mult be feparated from the found*’

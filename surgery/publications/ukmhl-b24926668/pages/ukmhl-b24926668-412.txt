Thus, by producing a High; irritation (which produce^ the lame effeCt, as is often obl’crved to happen after burn-, particularly in the hands, after which the' fingers often contract, and in many inftances, have remained contracted ever after) a cure may be ex- pected. Secondly, of the inver/ion of the lower Hit. The lower lid, vvhofc motion is very fmall, in com- panion of that of the upper, is preferred in its na- tural tiate, by the equal attion of the orbicular fibres Iprcad over it, and the ihickliels and renitenev of the rein which covers it. When, therefore, a tncbieftt is produced in the lower lid, it can only arife from a relaxation of the (kin, and a contraction of the in- ferior part of the orbicularis. The cure wiil ncccfTa- rily be effected by increafing the rcnircncy of the fkin to 1’uch a degree, as to prevent the contraction of the mufculus orbicularis. When the calc is re- cent, a cure has fometimes been effected, by for ning a told in the ikin before the inverted lid, to draw in edge from the uye, and prcfervilig the Ikin in tlia,; date by the application of fticking philter : or, by means of an inftrument fimilar to that contrived by Bartil’chius (and reprefented by Hcifter, plate 15, lig. 20.) to pinch up a fmall portion of the ikin, and hang thereby .on the cheek ; which by its weight, anfwcrs the fame purjofc as the plaftcr, and is lets liable to lofe its hold. In flight calcs, the (kin may recover its tone by theft means; but in others it xvi 11 be neceffary to cut off a fmall tranl’verfc portion of the loofe Ikin below the edge of the lid, and after- wards confine the Tides of the wound together by means of a future. ft is remarked by Gottlieb Richter, in his Midical and Surgical Obl'crvations, that the external Ikin of the eye is fo cxtcnfiblc, that much more of it ihould be cut than appears neceffary.

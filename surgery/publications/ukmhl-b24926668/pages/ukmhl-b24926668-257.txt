A membrane, in general ; but by t, is ufually underftood, the membrane which appears ,n form of a crefccnt, and is fituated at the entrance of the vagina. When this membrane is ruptured, it •s fhrivelled up, and forms the carunculre myttiformes. t naturally lhrinks with years, and often difappears refore the age of twenty, and therefore can be no •roof of •virginity. In fome infants, this membrane 0 clofes up the urethra, that the urine cannot be •oided ; in others, the urine pafles, but when the nenles flow, they cannot be dilchargcd, from the tymen being imperforated. When the mark of per- oration cannot be fecn, the cure has been thought mprafticable ; but in a cafe where the lancet did not ucceed, a trochar and canula were ufed with fuccefs, hough the perforation extended four inches before he deflred efleet was produced.

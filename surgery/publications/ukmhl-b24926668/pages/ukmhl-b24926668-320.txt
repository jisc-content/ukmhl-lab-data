O P H fore eafily fet at liberty, and the inflammation dif- appears as the fwelling fubfides. As an external application, a cerate may be made of the empl. e min. f. fera. & ol. oliv. As foon as the fwelling begins to fubflde, apply a bandage, and gradually increafe its tightncfs as circumftauces will permit. Over night give 1'mall dofes of calomel, and next morning a purging draught, in which is diffolved a proper quantity of the kali tartariz. Sudorifics, or diuretics, may be given to haften the cure ; which, when tolerably advanced, will require the bark ; this, at firft, ihould be accompanied with the kali acctatum ; but when evacuation is no longer required, rhe bark may be given alone. Vide Kirkland's Med. Surg. vol. i. Ophthalmia, from an tyr. In flamma- tioOculi. An Inflammation of the Membranes which invefl ibe Eyes, particularly the adnata. The inner coats, however, are fometimes the feat of the in- flammation. Dr. Cullen diftinguilhes two fpecies of ophthalmia, viz. Ophthalmia mtmbranarum; that is, when the tunica adnata, and membranes lying under it, or the coats of the eyes, are the feat of the in- flammation ; and ophthalmia tafi, when the inflamma- tion is attended with tumour, erofion, and glutinous exudation of the tarlus, or edges of the eye-lids. He alfo confiders all the cafes of ophthalmia mrmbranarw% as the fame difeafe, differing only in fltuation or de- gree, and curable by the fame means more or left employed. Any of the caufes of external inflammation, may produce the fame in the external coat of the eye; and the fame caufes which produce this dilordcr in other internal parts, may alfo prod ce it in the inner membranes of this organ. Accidents from without, as cold air, duff, too much expofure to vivid colours, blows, wounds, &?. and as internal caufes, the meafles, and fmall-pox, fcrophula, &c. are ali oeca- fionally the caufes of this complaint.

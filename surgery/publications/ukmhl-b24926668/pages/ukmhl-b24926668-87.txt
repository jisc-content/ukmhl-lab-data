BRO I nd Portugal. Some writers attribute it to a fcrophu- I ous caufe. Mr. Proffer inclines to think that it is a [iroply in the -gland, and fimilar to the dropfy in the varies. lie relates that Dr. Hunter differed one of I ihefe glands that had been confiderably enlarged, and was found to be enlarged by a number of cyfts lied with water.

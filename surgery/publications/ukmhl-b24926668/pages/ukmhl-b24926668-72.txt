A N E V Si 11C * In the falfe kinds of aneurijms, the cyft is probably formed of a portion of ihc aponeurofis that runs over the veffd, which, admitting of fomc cxtravafattd blood underneath, it becomes cxccinvely thickened and expanded ; that this membrane is the cyft, fcems to be confirmed by our fo readily difcovering the punflure in the artery upon opening the tumour : or it may be formed of the cellular membrane, which admits both of thickening and expanfion. The appearances of the varicofc aneurijm will dif- fer from the common falfe one as follows : the vein that was punftured will become varicous, and wil have a pulfatilc jarring motion, on account of the flream from the artery •, there will be a hiding noife, which will be found to correfpond with the pulfi for the fame reafon ; the blood in the tumour will b( almoft entirely fluid, bccaufc it is kept in conftani motion: it is foon formed to its largcft fize, anc there remains, if it is not difttirbed bv imprudeni management; there are no confidcrable inconvcni erices confequent. That this fort of anew ifin is pre fent, may be further known, by placing a finger ote the orifice in the artery : thus the ftream of bloot propelled into the vein, at every puliation, is felt by applying the car to the minified vein, a tremulou motion and noife are perceived •, by prclfing the cor refponding artery, this motion, noife, 8cc. ceafe, am on the removal of this preflfure the motions, &c. re turn ; the artery becomes larger in the arm and lniallc in the wrift ; the vein being emptied by prefiure inftantly fills again on taking the prclfurc oft ; th pulfe at the wrift grows weaker as the artery abo\ enlarges. ,, . ...

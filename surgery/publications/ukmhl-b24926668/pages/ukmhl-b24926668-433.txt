â– VUL Q^q 2 witl\ IThere are different fpccics of wounds, i Simple mcifed wounds. 2. Ptmflured wounds. 3. Lace- rated or contvfcd wounds. 4. Gun-Jbot wounds. And 13. Poifoned wounds. In order to the cure of a fimple incifed wound, remove he effufed blood with a fponge, prefled out of mo- dcrattHy warm water. If a conflderablc arterial haemorrhage, feeure the veflel by a ligature. Remove every extraneous body, if it can be done with pru- dence; extract it with your fingers, if pofiible, other- wife w ith the fcrcep , in doing which, place the patient i'n ftich a pofition as effectually tends to relax the in- i ured parts. When a lead ball is the fun ft -ice lodged, i fit cannot be cafily removed, it may be loft. But afplin- t:cr of wood, glafs, iron,or cloth, fhoqld be removed as libon as pofiible after the injure is inflicted. This -lone, the lips of the wound muft be brought toge- ther as nearly as pofiible, and fo retained by adhefive iplafters, if the wound is not deep; but otherwife, :rhe interrupted future muft be employed. Mr. Bell 'recommends the twitted future. The dreflings may Koe piedgits of foft linr, covered with one of tow, fpread with fome digeftive ointment, and large enough to cover the whole; thefe maybe lccurcd bv fuch oandages as the flfuation of the wound will admit; the firft dreflings ufuallv remain two or three days, or until the difeharge of matter renders the fepara- tion of them eafv. After the firft dreflings are re- moved; the dreliing may be repeated every twelve or twenty-four hours, according as the difeharge is more or lefs abundant or acrid. If, after the firft drefling, a warm digeftive is required, add to the ung. refitine. fiav. a little of the ol. tereb. vel ball", capiv. Tnefe applications need not be warmed, ex- cept when very cold; after fprcatling the pledgit, its lurface may be juft warmed by holding before the fire; each time that the furface of the wound is cleanfcd, it ihould be performed by dabbing it gently

PER afc, to which the tcfticlc is liable in its natural cuation, but what may alfo aflfedt it, in any or all s unnatural oiks. In the firft cafe, related by Mr. ottf a tcfticlc being detained in the groin of a young ealthy l'caman, who hurt tile part bv hitting it :gainft a piece of timber; the humour there became utremeiy painful, and was taken for a bubonocele, om which it might have been more readily diftin- i jifhfcd by the following circumftances, had not the | itreme tendernefs of the injured tellicle abf’olutely prevented any examination there by the touch ; and ite very hard fwelling cf the ferotum, which pre- ented any certainty of a tdlicle being there or nor.

S C I a which \vc may impute a fcirrbus as the caufe, the xiitcncc of one may be fufpedted. Though a fcirrbus does not always become cance- ous, yet cancers are moft frequently only farrbi in heir beginnings. The effedts of a fcirrbus will be arious, and very different, according to the part it .ifedts, and the functions which it injures. Bv preff- ng on the vena cava, a mortification in the legs has <ecn produced; by prtifing on certain nerves, epi- eptic fits have been produced. If all the glands in he neck arc indurated, thofc of the mefenicry will ie fo too, in which cafe a cure is not to be expected. I fdrrbus in the liver produces a jaundice, which is difficult, and often impoffibk to cure ; and this Juudice is followed by a dropfy. A fcirrbus may fo srei's upon the thoracic dudt as to Occafion a fatal trophy. Whether a fiirrhtts is feated internally or xternaily, if it is affedted by acrid humours, or nflammation, it becomes cancerous. If an attempt is made towards the cure of a fe.r- bus, wc fhould be certain that it is recent and not et quite hardened ; and that it is in its benign ftatc, . e. that it is free from itching, heat, or pain; for ftcr the appearance of any of thele circum dances, lathing but a palliative cure can be admitted of, cx- cpt the knife can be prudently ufed. In the earlier tate of an external [airbus, gentle mercurials are ifcd internally, but with caution not to irritate; xternaily, cooling and anodyne applications only are o be employed ; Inch as the aq. linurn. of Goulard ; he Jurrbus part fhould be covered with loft leather o prevent tnc clothes from irritating it; whatever teats, foitens, or can tend to produce a iuppuration, nuft be carefully avoided ; a fulution of fa, ammoniac n vinegar is applied externally as a refolvent ; fotpe ipjffy the vapours of vinegar to the tumid part. If > Jurrbus is final!, and continues of the fame li/.c, do nothing;

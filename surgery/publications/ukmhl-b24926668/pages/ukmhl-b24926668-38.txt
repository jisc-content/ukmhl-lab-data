- A C H a week ; the juice of the common ftar-thiftle, and blue bottle are ufcfnl; but fugar candy, finely pow- dered, is generally fufficient. Emetic wine dropped into the eye, may alio be ufed with advantage. The vapour of anifecd, or fennel water, is likewife ferviceablc. Vide Wallisâ€™s Nolblogia Methodica Oculorum. Achor. LaBumen: abas., acores, cerion ; favus. The arttfla la,Ilea of authors, and in England, the Scald Head. Trallian fays, it is a fore on the outfide of the head, full of little perforations, which difeharge a humour like ichor, whence its name. He farther fays, that the cerion rtfcmblcs an achor ; but that the mouths of the perforations are larger, rc- fembling the cells of a honey-comb, whence the name ; the matter is alfo nearly of the confidence of thin honey. When thefe difeafes fpread, the ferum, which ouzes out, dries, and forms a fcab. The acbor differs from the favus and tinea only in t,hc degree of virulence. It is called favus when the perforations are large, and tinea when they arc like thofe which are made by moths in cloth: but gene- rally by tinea is underfund a dry fcab on the hairy Ealp of children, with thick fcalcs and an offenfive fjncll; when this difordcr affefts the face, it is called erujla Uiflea, or milk fcab. Mr. Bell, in his Treatife on Ulcers, fays, that the tinea capitis & crufta latfca, may both be reduced to the fame fpccies of herpes, viz. the herpes fsufti/lvfts, they being naturally the fame, differing only in fituation ; the tinea is on the hairy fcalp, and the crufta la&ea on the face. Dr. Cullen places this difiafc under ULCUS; as a fyno- nyme ; where alfo he places the Crust a Lactea, the clals locales, and order dialyfes. When it hap- pens to children, if in other refpedfs they are healthy, the beft treatment, bcfidcs keeping the belly mode- rately lax, is clcanlincfs and a moderate diet; an ifl'uc may be made and continued till the difordcr is J cleared-J

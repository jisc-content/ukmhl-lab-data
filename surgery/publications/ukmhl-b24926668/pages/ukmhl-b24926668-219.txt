When it takes place from any other caufe, it begins with a running, nearly fimilar ::o that in a venereal gonorrhoea, but generally lefs in quantity, and is not attended with fo much inflamma- tion, and is never infedtious. Jn both calcs, the in- iflammatory fymptoms may, by expofure to any of the rcaufes, be encreafed to as great a degree as when there is infedtion ; but they go off of themfclves in a few days, and fometimes the running with them. IThc running fometimes ceafes of itfelf in a week or (two; fometimes it continues for years without any 'detriment to the patient ; and now and then a cafe occurs, in which the patient is much weakened by it; for when it occaflons involuntary cmillions of femen, 'it may be fatal. It is the mod obftinate after a venereal taint, in phlegmatic habits, and in thofe who, when young, â– were fubjedt to cararrhous defluxions ; for the fibres of fuch perfons arc very lax. Sometimes it refills all .means, and at lafl: departs fpontancoufly. The indications of cure are, i. To deftroy the venereal virus, z. To defend the parts from its acta- HTiony. 3.

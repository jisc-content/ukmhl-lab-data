E M P The chirargical method by which relief is obtained, is termed 7Jbe Operation for the Empyema. Though *' this operation is very feldom performed but for the .£ evacuation of pus, it may undoubtedly be employed 9 for blood, water, and air, with fuccefs. The method 3 of performing it is as follows : Lay the patient in an horizontal pofture, with the :jj fide in which the perforation is to be made lying over the bed. In this fituation, an alfiftant mull pull the | fkin oppolitc to the part to be cut, as much upwards as : pollible, and preferve it firmly in that fituation during j the operation. Then, with a fcalpel, make an inu- fion, of about two inches in length, betwixt the fixth j and feventh ribs, in the direction of thefe bones, and 1 at an equal diftancc, between the flernum and back- j bone, taking care to avoid the under border of the fuperior ; rib, on account of the blood vcjftls running in its groove., j It is not neceffary that the incifion to the bottom fhould j be of the fame extent as that in the fkin and cellular j fubllance. •The pleura being laid bare, divide it flowly and. cautioufly, to avoid wounding the lungs, if there ' fhould happen to be an adhefion. If they do not ad- here, the water will rufh out in great force imme- diately on a fmall hole being made in the pleura, Should there be an adhefion, the incifion may be either continued forward for an inch or two nearer the flernum, or, another opening may me made, either an inch or two higher, or lower in the thorax. As foon as the water is found to flow, a filver canula, with a pierced body, ftvuld be introduced at the opening. If you do not wifli to evacuate all the water at one |j time, fecure toe canul.i by a ribbon connected with it, b tied round the body, and apply a piece of cork to the | opening. Thus, after a day or two, an additio nal I quantity of w.tier may be drawn off. '1 lie drilling may be fomc bland ointment, ftcured by the napkin | and fcalpulary bandage. | la

O P H 3 to caufe the cornea to burft, the humours to be par- tially or wholly difcharged, and the eye, of courft', to fink in the orbit. To this accurate delcription of Mr. Ware's, it may be added, hat ufually, if left to nature, the quantity of mucus gradually increafes until about a tea-fpoonful of it may be fqueezed from each eve every day ; foon after this, if no extaordi- nary fymptoms attend, the mucus decrcafes, and with- out art a cure iscffedted. This kind of inflammation may arife from any of the caules that produce external phlegmonous inflam- mations. Mr. Ware obferves, that the tunica con- junftiva is defended from the acrimony of the tears by a loft thin muons fluid, which is luppofcd to exhale from innumerable fmall perforations dilperfcd all over its lurface. This fluid, as it naturally exifts, is very fmall in quantity •, on which account, as it is pellucid, it is undifcernable by the naked eye ; ncverthclefs, it is liable by an irritation or inflammation of the parts which furnifh it, not only to be inercafed greatly in quantity, but to be fo altered and changed in quality, a; very much to rcfcmblc pus itfelf, both in confidence and colour. This inflammation is not often connected with any other diforder, and is moll frequently fup- pofed to arife from the child’s being imprudently ex- polcd to the cold air. a j When early aflxflance has been given, its crnfe- qucnces are generally luccefsful; but when negle&cd, a partial blindnefs at lead, and too often a total one, has been the confcqucnce. Like all inflammations of the eye, it is apt to terminate in an opacity of the cornea. in order to the cure, it is recommended by fome to wath the msuus out ot the eye. whilft in a tender in- flamed ftatc, with a cc.ilyrium of equal parts of the common cmullion and julep of camphor.

A N U ) no anus externally. If the rcdtum reaches too ear the part where the anus lhould be, the impulfe f the faces againd the fkin will difeover where a erforation may be made; but if no fuch impulfe is ) be felt when the child coughs or cries, relief can- ot be afforded. 2d, Where there is a circle or mark 1 the lkin which points out where the anus lhould e : in this inftance the difficulty is not confiderablc. fowever, it may be proper to obferve here, that the erforating inftrument lhould be introduced into the iredtion of the os facrum ; if it paffes forward, the adder, or the uterus, or both, may be injured ; if is to be introduced far up, to divide a membranous odrudtion in the redtum, in cutting it lhould be loved not upward, but from fide to lide ; thus you void cutting the proftate gland, or the velicufa fe- linales, and perhaps the neck of the bladder. 3d, fhere there is a well formed anus, and perforated, ut it has no communication with the intcdinal tbe, from the redtum being imperforated.

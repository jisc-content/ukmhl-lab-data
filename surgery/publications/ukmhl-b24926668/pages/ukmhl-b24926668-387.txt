SCR i nt of the 1>ocTv. Some obferve, that fcrofuSous . tiers have their furfacc rather convex, and with an ] aiforin giofiy appearance. Mr. Bell obi'ervcs, in ? s Treatii’e on Ulcers, that Co long as the general orbid diat.hefis -continues in the fyftem, it is com- ii only in vain to attempt their cure ; nor would it deed often be Cafe, as by drying up the lores in ic part, they very commonly break out elicwhcre, id juft as readily fall upon the lungs, or Come other ■ganof confequenec to life, as on any other. Until (ic Screfu/a’h removed from the habit, all that ftiould i b done to the ulcers which are produced by it, i ., to produce as free and open vents to the matter as i aJiible, without endangering the ^formation of r aufes. The beft applications are faturninc prepa- rations. Mr. Aik in, in his Oblervations on the xtemai Ufe of Preparations of Lead, lays, that aiollient applications of all forts are highly injurious lien applied to fcrofulous ulcers: by weakening the ! lids, already too much difpofed to relaxation, they I 'event all endeavours of nature to bring about a firm carnation; and by giving the fluids an acrimony, i | i which in this difeafe they are not remarkably difi* i ] ofed, they occafion a kind of eryfipelatous corro- i | ve fpreading of the ulcer. Th# milchiefs occa- I antd by emollient applications are ftiU more clearly 'hewn, by the fpeedy change produced by almoft II .’cry kind of topics of the oppofite clafles, the IJ Iringent and the ftimulant. The moft Ample of jjic aftringent and ftimulant, viz. cold water, has j cmiently a good cffcft on throwing afid.e every 11 felling, and walhing the fore with it. Water, with < | very kind of feline and mineral impregnation, is Co uCed to advantage ; particularly fea-water, and jboulard's faturninc water. The greafy, faturninc j iplications are improper in thefe calcs. A continn- II ion of fuch Ample dreflinss as thefe, is all that, in

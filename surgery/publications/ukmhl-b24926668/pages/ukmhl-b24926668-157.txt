D I S id your own invention will point .out to you venty ways of fecuring the patient upon a bed (for tabic is ufually too high) fo that a proper refinance : tnade to the extenfion. This done, the knee bent, ad a towel fixed properly above it, you mud place jurfcl'f on that fide of the tliigh to which the bone idjflocatcd, with your knee near the head of the >ne, and both hands on the oppofite fide of the knee the patient, an aififtant being fixed, at the ankle, he extenfion may then gradually be begun by three four men, with the thigh rather in a date of flex- i; and when there is reafon to think that the head the bone is brought to a level with the fockcr, the renfion being fteadily continued, the knee may bent near to the abdomen, and, at the fame time* (illt’the knee puftics the bone towards its place, the cle mud be moved in the fame, bait the knee of patient in a contrary direction. Thus the head 1 always go into the fockcr, provided a due exten- i is made before you attempt to return it.” Sometimes the head of the thigh bone is pufiied ween the ifehium and facrum; in this cafe, ex. t the patient is very lean, before attempting the udtion, it may, perhaps, be mod eligible to reduct patient s flefli by repeated brifk purges, given at rt intervals; for thus the date of the cafe is berter overed, and the reduction more eafily effected. hjl'jcations of the Patella. The patella may be ully or completely luxated, and it may be dif- cd either upward or downward, outward or ard, it may alfo be luxated by itfelf, or dif- ed with the tibia and fibula, when tliofc bones [allocated. A complete luxation cannot take place ny direction, without a rupture of the ligament, dt ties it to the tibia, or of the tendon of the as mulcle, connected to the upper part of it, or •aps of both. The redudtion is effedted by plac- ■ Pat‘fiit on a bed or table, and dretching out hi;

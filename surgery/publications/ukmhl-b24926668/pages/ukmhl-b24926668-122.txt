If the quantity of pus is too fmall, drels it with ung. refill, or other fuch digeftive. If the opening in the integu- ments is fo fmall that the matter detained is either ab* (orbed into the circulation, or forms finuous ulcers, the aperture rauft be enlarged by means of fponge tents, and kept fo by dOifils of lint. Indeed, if the exfoliation is likely to be tedious, in fome cafes it may be haftened by the ufe of a cauftic or aftual cautery, though in general the fuppuration which contributes to throw off tile difeafed part is thereby retarded, or the rafp may be ufed ; if, inftcad of the aftual cautery, a potential one is preferred, the common cauftic is th# beft. ... , n Id the worm-eaten cants, it is necedary to deltroy all the affc&ed part of the bones as foon as convenient- ly can be done, by rafping, trepanning, &c. according as each of them can be applied; after which the method is as above. When the ulcer is deep, let honey diflolved in vinegar and water be injedted into it every day. 1 In the carnous caries, the fungous and corrupted parts are bed deftroyed Dy a cauftic; though Gooch, in his Cafes and Remarks, vol. ii. p. 359, g1^ an in- ftancc of the inefficacy of cauftics in this cafe, and of the neccffiry of ufmg'the aftual cautery, which he in general prefers. . f ' The phagedenic Caries: one or two applications ot the potential cautery are fufficient to reduce it to the nmft fimple kind of caries ; but fometimes great diffi- culties attend it. , â€ž , The fcrophulous caries: deftroy fully the teguments which cover the abfeefs formed on the bone with a cauftic, cut the elchar through the middle to evacuate the matter; and to lave the efehat as long as poilib e,

The feton mult pafs from the orifice in the ulcer, ong the conrfe of the finus to its other extre- . :ity, where an opening, large enough for the dif- • targe, lhouid be made, as is done in cafes of abfeels. The cord of cotton, or of filk, fhould at firft be -retry large, more or lei’s fo, according to the capa- :ty of the finus; it lhouid be diminilhcd gradually the cure advances, bv taking away a thread or two rtm it? thicknefs every lecond or third day ; and at -ft, when the dilchargc is greatly Icflfencd, by the acuity occafioncd by the finus being rnoftly filled up, -e feton lhouid be totally w ithdrawn, and a bandage mew hat tight being applied over the part, and - ntinued for fome time longer, a complete cure will, general, be in due time eft’efted.

SCR of the conftitution may remain ; but Mr. Bell ob- ferves, that in fome cafes, the ulcers arc fo inv cterate as to require other aidsalfo; as when they become fwelled, painful, and difeharge a corroding, acrid matter : when fuch appearances occur, a carious bone may frequently be fufpe&ed to be at the bottom of the fore, and then nature muft be alfifted, by free- ing her from fuch parts of it as arc moft difeafed, and that are become loofe. This, in fome fituations, may be done ; but when the complaint is fixed in any of the large joints, art can rarely afford much alfiftance; and as amputation is not often advifeable, from the rifk of the difeafe returning to fome other part, na- ture alone muft often be trufted to. in fuch a litua- tion, a continued ufe of fea-bathing, the bark,with hem- lock, particularly to promote a proper difeharge from the fores, muft be employed. And when, by a due ufe of the neceffary means, there is a tendency in the fores to heal, iffues fhould be formed, fo as to produce a difeharge as nearly equal to that from the fores as may be; thus the cure is carried on, both more effec- tually and fafely. Thefe iffues are generally re- quired through life. Gentle compreflion is peculi- arly ufeful in this kind of ulcers: it particularly prevents and removes that thickncfs in their edge* that fometimes is obferved. Thefe, in general, are the means that aifift and are moft ufeful, when there is a tendency in nature to overcome the difeale: but it being, in general, an opprobrium mcdicorum, it is difficult to aflert with much pofitivenefs concerning it.

The bones of the fingers and umb are all'o fometimes luxated, but not often, he ufual fymptoms of diflocation take place here, hen any of the metacarpal bones are dil'placed at eir connexion with the bones, they mull be re- accd by keeping the arm fteadily fixed, and pulhing em from above downward, while the hand remains ife and moveable. When the firft phalanx of any the fingers is moved from its junction with the rrc (ponding metacarpal bone, let one alfnfant fix e hand, while another draws down the diflocatcd ger, which mult be done by grafping the firft pha- ix only, in order to prevent the other joints of the ger from being hurt.

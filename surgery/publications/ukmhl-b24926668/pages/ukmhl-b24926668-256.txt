Dr. Vaughan pro- polls the adtual cautery to be appliecl to the part, after; the bite, as foon as polliblc ; o/ rather, a dilatation of the wound, if I'm ail, and filling it with gunpowder, then letting fire to it 4 tnis, he liippofes, would pro-; duce a laceration of the part, would, fccure a free and continued difchargc.. fpr lome. tiruc; and he thinks, that the a&ion of the ignited gunpowder upon thd poii’on, may have its ufe. Perhaps tlte following may be purlucd as the’ moft probable means of relief : Avoid lla and cold bathing; keep the wound open by a pea, and Iprinkle cantharides into it every lleoud or third day; rub in the ung. liydrargyr. fort, fo as, to raifo a gentle ptyalifm, and particularly rub .thp throat 'with it; if fpafmodic fymptotns appear, give opiates with antimoniak, to excite pafpiration.

The vyarm bath, if the patient does uot ob- jafl to it, generally palliates. Trrrkabh , the belt mode that can be adopted, is, 1 innediatety on the bite being given, to luck the wound well for fome little time, then cut the bitten part away, rub the wound freely with cauftic, and direct the ufe.of mercury both internally and ex- ternally, till a ptyalilm is produced.

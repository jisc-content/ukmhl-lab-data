A N C colon. Petit divides this cafe into the true and falfe • the true are fuch wherein the bones are united fo ai to become as it were one ; the talfe is when, tiom the tendons being comraded, or other parts about thi joint are difeafed, the limb is rendered immoveable. The bones are covered at their ends, where the] form joints, with cartilages, to facilitate their motion and to prevent any farther production of bone ; ant if thefe cartilages (hould be eroded, there will be ai excrcfcence which will produce this diforder : how ever, it is fometimes a cure of lome other worie mil forrunc. . . . The general caufes arc a caries, abU-elks in thi joints producing caries, oflification of the ligament! ilrumous and rickctty diforders, and contradlion a the tendons. . . When the bones arc united, the cure ts lmpoftibie and whatever cite is the caufe, the cure is very ini' certain, on account of the difficulty of coming at th feat of the difeafe; and, indeed, often from the dith culty of knowing what part about the joint is the par primarily and principally affedted, or even in <*n) £ vrcc the caufe. . . The mod fimple cafe of this kind, is that from i long confinement of the limb to one polition ; an in fl immarorv affeftion of the ligaments, from externa injuries, is generally very dilhcult to remove ; rheii matic and ar'thritic matter falling on the joint is ha*.; ro be removed ; but the word is what is conunonl] called a white levelling, which is mod probably owmj to a fcrophulous virus. On difledtion, after the appearance called a wHit fwclling, there is always found a great thickening c rhe ligaments, which fo con founds the l'cv era I parts, tli. they can fcarce be diftinguifhod, together with crutt matter forming finufes through this undidinguiffifl mafs ; and generally an erofion of the cartilages I tiic f nd of the bones. , —

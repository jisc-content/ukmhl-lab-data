OPH advantage has followed a complete tranfverfe division of this artery; by which the patient' not only re* ceived benefit from the fudden derivation of a large quantity of blood, b it one principal fource from which the blood circulated to the inflamed part, was cut off. The external jugular vein has alio fome- times been opened in this complaint; but as it does not come from the eye itfelf, it does not yield a very diredt derivation. As to leeches, when they arc ap- plied to, or near the eye-lids, they have fometimes occafioned them to Iwell to a large fize, and have in- creafed, for a time, the irritation of the eye ; to pre- vent which, when they are applied near the eye, confine them, as near as pollible, in the hollow of the. temple, about an inch and a half from the outer orbit. Dr. Kirkland thinks, that any otlter bleed- ings than from the arm, arc not attended with fuperior advantage; as to leeches, he fays, they leave an inflammation behind, and occafion a greater irritability in the neighbouring parts. Dr. Cullen fays, that in many cafes a very effectual remedy is that of fcarifying the internal furface of the inlerior eye-lid ; and ftill more fo, is cutting the turgid vcl- fels, upon the adnata. This is a very delicate opera- tion, and fhould never be performed, unlcfs the Surgeon has a very Heady hand. As foon as blood is taken away, let a cooling purge be given ; and I mall dofes of the natron vitriolat. may be repeated every day after, fo as to procure a few ftools, until the violence of the fymptoms give way. Particularly, Ijg careful to avoid ftrong purges. A bliftcr, when applied to relieve inflammation in the eves, is tnoft effectual when laid upon the fore-part of the head, and kept open a few days; apply the plaftcr from the crown to tne forehead, having firft lhavcd the part. Dr. Kirkland is cf opinion, that blitters, like leeches, are prejudicial, by increasing irritability where they arc applied, and to iome extent around them. J he feet

S C I rnailc a crucial incifion upon the temporal mufcle, with good I'ucceh, the mufcle Hill continuing its uflton. Vide Gooch's Trcatife of Wounds, p. 25;. Sc ir rhus, from cxiffw, to harden, is a tumour of incomprdfiblc hardncfs, without pain. Dr. Culka places this difeafe in the clafs locales, and order tumores; he defines it, a hard tumour of (ome parr, moll frequently of a gland, not painful, and funpu- rating with dilSculty. Dr. Aitkin reckons the phyf- conia (a genus in Dr. Cullen’s fyftcm) a fpccics of Jen bus. Thc/ircoole lie includes as another fpccics. The feat of this kind of tumour is ufually fome glandular part ; not but fome other may be alio, and lometimcs is thus difordcred. The fluids in the glands being infpilfated, inmate in hardncfs, and form a /cirrous; or the contents of the lymphatic vcflfels in the liver, or other parts, coagulating, gradually harden, and form the like. It is probable, that fitnbi arc formed by too free bleeding; fur thus the circula- tion may he fo diminilhed in its force as not duly to afFcdt the iinaller veffcls, and thus obftrudtions may be formed, which end in fiirrbufis. All uetfons, and at any age, may be the fubjcfls of this dtlorder; but the fedentary, and more parti- cularly women, when their nienfes decline, and lometimcs, indeed, at their appre-auh, are moll fre- quently rhus difordcred. From the moll attentive examination, it appears that the matter of tittle tumours is infpiflated lymph. They often arife without any previous inflammation, from the proper fluid ftagnating in tite gland, ore:.-' iravafatiun from cuntufn n, ,Vc. Sometimes it hap- pens witen a gland is the feat of an inflammation, < nJ the inflammation termin.t’cs without coining to- f uppttration.

G tr 2 -mours arc corrofive, they excite a gnawing pant ; when the wax ferments whilft it is yet in the glands, •it caiifes a teniive pain ; when the glands are very turgid, there is a fenfe of weight; and when there :is a tumour, a pulfation is perceived, efpecially if it tends to fuppurate. If the pain is violent, it feldom fails to bring on a •fever, which is early attended with great rcftlelfhefs, and a delirium, fainting, and often convulfions are •the confequence; for the membrane tljat Lines the .ear are exquifitely fenfible, and fully ftored with •nerves, beftdes, membranes which adhere to bones, have a more than ordinary fenfibility. In the beginning, whilft the pain is net very con- fftderable, a little warm olive oil dropped in the ear, will <often relieve. If cold is the caufe, keep the head warm. If there is inflammation and tumour, which 'will be known bv the throbbing pain, a fuppuration rmay be encouraged by cataplafms, applied warm on the outer ear; but if the ftate of fuppuration is not tmanifeftly near, endeavour by bleeding, purging, und difeutients applied to the ear, to remove the in- flammation and pain; if external heat was the caul'e, ■bleed, and give daily a moderate dole of Glauber’s ■fait as a purge until the pain abates, or until there is rreafon to fufpedt a fuppuration ; an opiate may be given at night when the pain is violent. When acrid defluxions are the caufe, injebt a warm minium of poppy-heads in water. When living infedts have crept into the ear, blow the i'moak of tobacco therein, and then pour in warm oil. If purulent matter dif- chargcs itlclf, injedt tepid water, mixed with a little foap, or honey of roles. Bolides the above-mentioned, blifters behind the ears, bladders of warm water laid on the affedted ear, and the pediluvium, areoccafion- ally ufeful. Vide Lobb on Painful Diftcmpcrs.

GEN ie'ir conneftion was not evident. He fuppofes that, Hiring their growing, thelc cartilages and bones are onneCled to the neighbouring pans by vefiels ; and aat, when either their determined growth is ftnifhed, rr their fi7.e is too large for the eal'y motion of the uint, they become loofe. When they become loofe, he fynovia, from the irritation they induce, is fe- reted in greater quantity ; the capfular ligament bc- omes diflended, the kner appears lwelled, a degree f ftiffnefs takes place in the motion of the joint, nth more or lei’s of external inflammation. There 5'alio the diftinft feel of a fluid undfcrneath ; and ahe loofe bit of cartilage gets frequently above the ondylcs of the femur, on the out or infide of the rtee, and may be laid hold of with the thumb and inger through the integuments. When the patient, las walked much, the fynovia is fenfibly increafed, nd on remaining more quiet, for two or three days, s as fenfibly diminiihed. The fymptoms are fome- imes fo mild as not to need an operation, but at other imes it is the only expedient for relief. Mr. Cruik- hank here obferves, that much feems to depend on he l’urgeon, whether this operation flr.ill be a dan- gerous one or not. Mr. John Hunter recommends he moving them by incifion ; but thinks the p irti- :uiar fpot where the operation is to be performed, as •veil as the manner of operating, deferve the greateft attention. There is a part within the cavity of the oint of the hue, which receives the bafis of the pa- :ella, during the cxtenlion of the leg. It partakes more of the nature of cellular membrane, than cap- ular ligament, and lies under the lower extremities af the vafti and crureus mufcles, before they are in- ferred into the patella. Mr. Hunter propofes to lay hold of the cartilage or bone, and cut down upon them at this place ; the incifion, he thinks, fiiould be no larger than juft to allow of their being cafilv thruft out.

H JE when the piles arc externa!, and caufcd by a bearing down of the anus. 3. Htemorrbois Jiuens, when the piles are internal, without external tumour, or bear- ing down of the anus. 4. Hsrmorrbois cceca, when there are pains and tumour about the anus, and no difeharge of blood. From diffefiions, this difeafe feems to be an ecchymc- fis in the ccllubar membrane of the lower part of the reftum, from the extremities of the neighbouring veffels : if this be true, it accounts for the great lois of blood this wav, without lofs of ftrength, for it is gradually emptied into the ecchymofis, and it is from thence that it pours out fo fcemingly plentifully. There is feldom much difeharge from the external haunorrhoidal veffels, but they readily admit of vari- ces being formed in them, which are painful. The internal haemorrhoidal veffels not only difeharge a large quantity, bur when fuppreffed, thofc diforders are generated which arife from dilorders of the liver, fplcen, pancreas, mcfcntcry, and inteftines. Near the extremity of the inteftinum reftum, in- ternally, arc little jagged proceffcs, fomewhat like the carunculae myrtiformes in the vagina, which are the feat of the internal, as well as of the external piles. Thole who arc of a lax, fpongeous habit, and dif- pofed to feed ; who eat heartily, and drink freely ; who indulge in cafe ; who arc habitually coftive, &c, are the moll 1'ubjciSl to this diforder. The piles often affeft pregnant women, from thd preffure of the uterus on the haemorrhoidal veins, i; all other cafes, the immediate caufc is a difficult cir dilation of the blood through the haemorrhoidal veins in confequcncc of their perpendicular firuntion, anq want of valves. The difeharge happens when th extremities of the veffels in the inteftinum rettum nr fo diftended by the accumulated blood, as to be re rumed, Whatever generates a redundance of blocc

* G 2 ipinc Dr. Hunter divides atteurifms into four kinds, viz. he true, the falfc, the mixed, and the varicofe. Fuji, of the true Aneurifm. The true aneurifm is formed by a dilatation of the rtery. It may happen in any part of the body, but loft frequently is found in the curvature of the aorta, /hich is fubjeft to this dii'ordcr from the extraordi- ary impulfe of the blood there ; from the curvature, : runs upwards along the carotids, or the lubclavi- ns, generally increafing, till by its great diftention it s ruptured, and the patient dies. The degrees of the dilation of the aorta, in cafes of his kind, are various; in fome, the curvature of this rtery has been fo enlarged as nearly to fill the upper â– art of the bread. And what is peculiar, and de- erving our attention, is, that the i'pot of the veil'd, vhich is the weakeft, and where the difeafe begins, > apt to be ftretehed more in proportion than other rteries, and to form particular cells, where they neet with firm reftftance, more than where their fup- iort is foft and yielding. The fac formed by the diftenfion of the artery is sot a diftenfion of a particular coat, but of the whole ubftance of the veil'd ; but the thicknefs of the coats f thefc facs will laft only to a certain period, for when he veftels of the coats can no longer conform to the xtenfion, the circulation grows languid, the fac be- omes thinner at its apex, and foon after burfts : far- hcr, as the aneurifmal tumour increnfes in fize, ft meets vith reftftance from the neighbouring parts, and as he coats will be more or lefs affefted, according to he degree of the reftftance, in i'omc places they will if fimply diftended, in others abfolutely deftroyed, . g. where the aneurifmprefles againft the diaphragm, t will be thinner than where it fuffers no preifurc; t is ftill thinner where it prefles againft the tendi- tous part of the diaphragm, and where it prefles the

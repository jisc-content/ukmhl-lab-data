This kind of fiftula. is called complete, when there is an opening into the gut. and another externally ; it is called incomplete, when there is no external' aperture. The fymptoms of the incomplete kind, are anala- gous to thofc of the piles, and therefore are difficultly diftinguilhed. The complete kind has generally cal- lous lips, which, with the difeharge therefrom, more readily points out the nature of the cafe. Abfceffes in this part Ihould be opened as foon as wc find a fluctuation of matter, and that by a large I opening, which is the moll effectual method to pre- > vent a return. In examining one of thefc fiftula:, if | the probe docs not readily pafs, injeCt warm milk into it, and obferve if any returns by the rcCtuin ; if it docs, it is clear that the gut is perforated. When the probe is ufed for examining, let the patient Hand on the ground with his feet pretty far-afundcr, and lean on his belly over a table, then an affiflant can -hold the buttocks afundcr, that the operator may more I readily introduce his finger into the anus, before he I examines the fiftula with a probe. If thefiftula runs I fo deep, that the finger introduced into the anus can- fa not cafily reach the orifice, then the cure is not prac- I ticable, on account of the hemorrhage from the vef- I fcls, which admit not either of comprclfion or kga- i ture. If a fiftula has been of long Handing, in a bad ■ habit, and the difeharge is fuch as to weaken the pa- ft. tient, the operation Ihould not be attempted, at leaft t till the conflitution is repaired-, but if the patient is L of a good habit, if the fiftula returns, the operation <i may be repeated. The following is Dr. Monro’s method of operating: g “ Wherever the opening of the fiftula if, if it has I i!J7 1 1

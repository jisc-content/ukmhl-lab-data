D I S xtcnfion, the patient does not ftifter from thofe roublefome excoriations and contufions, which too ommonly attend the other methods. As to the iiic of machines for reducing a luxated umcrus, it is generally allowed they are never nccd- tl. Frcke’s commander is preferred to all the reft the inftruments tiled for this purpol'e ; in the life it, the limb may be moved in all directions dur- g the extenfion, and the lituation of the head of ic bone can be examined ; but great care is required keep it perpendicular to the fide of the patient. As in other luxation;, bleeding, &c. to prevent or back inflammation and levelling, muft be ufed after e reduction, and the arm fufpended in a fling.

If the ligaments and tendons are rigid, let emollient plications be uled lome time before the reduClion is empted.

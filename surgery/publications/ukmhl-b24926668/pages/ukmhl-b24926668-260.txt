I N F vifions of inflammation, like fever, they arc all but inflammation, differently circumftanecd. If the l'an- guineous vcffels, in thofc membranes that are in- flamed, arc the feat of the irrita *-ni (as in infant* nations of the ftomach, brain, &c.) the inflammation is then called phlegmonous ; but when the irritation is on the furfacc of the membranes, it ftimulatcs the fecrctory mucous glands to the accumulating and difeharging more than in a natural ftate they ufually do. So an irritation, and its confcqucnt, an extraor- dinary afflux, of circulation of humours through rhe part, conftitutc inflammation in both cafes. All the inflammations that come under the name of phlegmonous, have the fame feat; they arc all in the fanguinc arteries of the part inflamed. Bocrhaavc, to fupport his doctrine on this kind of infant- niaticn, fpeaks of the red blood being obftru&ed by an error of place; but obstruction is pot a caufe, though it may be an effeft of this difordcr. The mucous membrane is the feat of thofc inf am* nations which come under the denomination of in- formations of the mucous membrane. If there are tumours, the inflammation is phlegmonous, and thefe are diftinguilhed into phlegmonous and eryffpctalous. The feat of the phlegmonous is in the finguinaiy art; tirt, and the cellular membrane; the ft it of the cry flpelatous is in the fin, or other internal membranes no: cellular. Dr. Cullen ttfes the term pblogofs for this genus of difeafe. He places it in the clafs pvrexier, and order pbirgmaftC. Defines it to be a fever, rednefs of an external part, with heat, and a painful tenfion. The fpecics he points out, arc, i. Pblovfs pblrgmone, the phlegmonous inflammation. 2. Pblogofs eryibrnni, c rythematous inflammations. The principal cffVcH of inf animations arc heat, pain, fwelling, rednefs, an accelerated pulfe, a dry- nti's of the ^kin, and an itching. The

The obftruftion is moft com- monly in the fac, in this cafe, the tears, fometimes mixed with mucus, flow back into the eye through’ the pun6ta, when preflure is made upon the fac. The caufes producing an obflru£lion to the paflage of tire tears, are, either a thickening of the membrane lining the fac ; a lodgment of inf piffled mucus in the inferior por- tion of the cavity, or a fpafmodic aftion in that part, called by fome the fpbinSer of the fac. Either of thefe caufes may take place fcparately; they fometimes cxift together, and mutually tend to encreafe each other. The mod approved mode of cure, was firfl recom- mended by M.

The pipe introduced, remove the finger from tire lower lid. and apply it as accurate- ly as poflible over the luperior punftuni, to prevent the1 liquor from efcaping through it. To determine the liquoc downwards to the nofe, the lachrymal lac ina; be con.prcflcd.

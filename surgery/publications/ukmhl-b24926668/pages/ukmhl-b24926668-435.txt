V U L Qn 3 tlie c wounds of importance, Mr. Bell’s practice is, when they irun in fuch a direction as to prevent a feton from being carried along their whole courfe,toopen them immedi- ately from one extremity to the other,asfar as can be done uvith fafety, either with a probe-pointed biltoury, or "vith a fcalpel and a director, and then drefs them as tfimple iiicifod wounds. But when a feton can be mfed, emollient poultices are employed till a free l’up- jpuration is induced, and there is no probability of in- f flammation proceeding coo far. A cord is then in- troduced nearly equal to the fize of the opening, and allowed to remain, til! any extraneous matter is difeharged; it is then gradually lelfened by with- drawing a thread or two, every two or three days, tiil it is reduced to a third or fourth of its original thicknefs, and then taken out entirely. The bed pradtice, perhaps, in every cafe of punc- tured wound, is (where it can be done with fatety) to enlarge it immediately, and more particularly in thofe cafes where the wound has been received by a fmall ( word, or a. bayonet. When, from the conti- guity of large blood-vcfl'els and nerves, it may be unfafe to lay the wound open, and when the fituation of the wound will not admit of a counter-opening, for the introdudtion of a feton, we mud trud to a proper application of preffurc. If the external aperture feems difpofed to heal, before a fimiiar tendency appears in the bottom of the fore, tents mud be employed of a prepared fponge, or other fuch materials. Mr. Bell, how- ever, recommends leaden, tubes for this purpol’e, but we Ihould not be too hady to adopt either. Uiceratfd or Con deft d Wound*.

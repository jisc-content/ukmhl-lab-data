BUB ■without any late contagion, it then is the pathognomo- nic (ign of a latent pox. Tiiis tumour fhould be diftinguiftied from thofe that are limply inflammatory, peftilerttial, ftrumous, or the critical difcharge of lome other diforder ; and when in the groin, it muft be di.ftinguilhed from the epiplocele, and the enterocele. Alfo from the detention of a tel- :icle in the groin. Jn order to the cure, when venereal, the chief con- 'deration is to deftroy the venereal poilon with which he body is contaminated; this done, the bubo is no other than a fimple tumour or abfcefs in the part ; this oeing duly adverted to, if the bubo is but in its begin- ning, it may generally be difperfed by bleeding, if the tabic is inflammatory,or a fanguine plethora is manifcft ; md by rubbing as much of the ung. hydrargyri fort, on the patient’s groin as he can bear without falivating; gentle purging, at proper intervals, and a cooling diet, aflift this intention. But if, by the increafe of the in- flammation, it appears that a fuppuration is likely to ioIIow, the (boner this (fate is completed, the more oeifeft and fatisfa&ory will be the cure. The com- mon bread poultice applied warm, or, if this cannot oe complied with, a foft plafter, on which is galbanum, may be applied ; all evacuations muft now be forborne, md the diet may be more generous. The prominent >ait of the fuppurated fhould be opened with a cauftic, md the ulcer treated as is common in venereal cafes. Tile buboes that are feirrhous or cancerous, arc beft ' left quiet, efpecially while they are tafy : when they lrc painful, treat them as occult cancers. r y ’^c Tf ijicr s Surgery.

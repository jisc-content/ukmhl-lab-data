A tenfion and harduefs is perceived 1 through the whole length of the urethra, and a len- j fation of ftrifture in the penis, particularly during an creation. The matter diicharged is thinner, loics its adheflvenefs, and is more ill coloured. The in- flammation often occafions a curvcdne-ts in the penis, and the l'timulus, by which the inflammation is ex- cited, occafions an eredtion too when the patient is. warm in bed, and fometimes produces involuntary, j emillions; this fymptom is called a chordee, or a priapifmui. If the inflammatory fymptoms arc vio- lent, a Itrangury comeson. Sometimes an inflamma- tion in the prepuce coniines it from being drawn back, and thus forms a[â€˜byv.cjis ; or being drawn behind the glans cannot be returned, and is then called /- mo/is. When the tincture from tlicl'c two laid fymp- toms is not fpcedily relieved, a mortiiication comes oa the part, or the whole of the penis becomes u.-duna- tous, in which cal'e, without great care, a gangrene follows, I ii all thcl'e cafes, ulcers are apt to be formed. Tlius the inflammation continues to inertufe generally for about a week or two. If the mucus that is dil- charged walhcs away the venereal matter fader than, it is formed, the fymptoms may continue in the fame, date for foinc time, aud then gradually dccrcafc, and at length a cure is eiledtcd. All thefe fymptoms may occur, without occaiioning the Lues Venerea, llrictiy fptaking. Vide Gq.vokiukia. When the diforder dot-snot terminate thus, ulcers are formed, or the venereal poilun being ablorbcd, mftead of a gonorrhoea, a lues venerea, or pox, is the confequcncc. When the gonnrihpea is long con- tinued, it foiTictimes produces a ftriefure in the ure- thra, and otcnlimik a difficulty in the evacuation of the urine, wliieh is often attended with pain, rho * water

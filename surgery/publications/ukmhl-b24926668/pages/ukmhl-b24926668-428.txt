U R E the whole conrfe of the perinaeum. When a ftone has been long fixed at obie particular part without yield- ing in any degree; and when the pain and inflam- mation produced by it are confidcrablc, a chirurgical operation ought to be immediately employed for re- moving it ; but, in the incipient ftages of this dif- order, other means of a more gentle nature Ihould be firft put in practice. In order to folicit the paflage of the ft nc, one important endeavour is, to remove fipafm; with this view, if the patient is plethoric, bleed; if he is thin and emaciated, a proportionable Quantity of blood Ihould be taken by means of leeches, dire&ly from the part affeCted. A quantity of warm oil ihould be repeatedly injeCtcd into the umbra, to lubricate the paflage ; the patient Ihould a)fo be im- merfed into a warm bath ; and a full dofc of the tindt. opii. ihould be at the fame time given. A proper quantity of blood having been difeharged ; the patient having remained for a fufheient length of time in the warm bath ; and the opiate having begun to operate, the parts will thus be as completely re- laxed as poiTible : and this is the period when i'ome attempt ihould be made for extraditing the ftone. To this end, inftead of any of the inftrutnents recom- mended for this purpole, which often do harm by iu- creafing irritation; the burgeon ihould at firft endea- vour, by very gentle prelfure, to puih the ftone for- ward along the courfe of the umbra : in this manner, large (tones may be brought off, for the removal of which a very painful operation might otherwife be liecefliiry. When the ftone fills up the urctbor notwithftanding the ufe of means as above, it will not pafs, it will be neceflfary to proceed to the epe- ratâ€™on, which is performed by cutting upon the ftone, and extracting it either with a fcoop or with a pair of fmall forceps. When the (tone is fixed in the urethra near the neck of the bladder, lay the patient on a table, fecure him as for the operation of lirho-

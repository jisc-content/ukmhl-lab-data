The tibia is the only bone of the leg imme- diately concerned in the joint of the knee. It cannot be diflocated without drawing the fibula with it. From the great ftrength of the knee joint, ir cannot be completely luxated, but by fuch force as mult rup- ture the teguments, ligaments, and tendons which c<m- nett the bones. Thefe bones, therefore, are feldom forced entirely pad each other, and from the lame caufe, a partial luxation feldom happens. However, a complete, or partial difiocation may take place on either fide, though the bones are more readily iorced back- ward than forward. The inoft partial difiocation oc- cafions confiderabie pain, lamcncls, and deformity which is very evident on comparing both knee joints J f the patella is diflocated with the tibia and fibula, r will generally be reduced with thefe bones, but whet * not, it muft t>e replaced as directed in Article D.jlota- cation of the ratclla. I To reduce the difiocation of this joint, fix the titigtt' firmlv, and extend the leg till the ends of the bones aril entirely clear of e3ch other ; the tibia and fibula con# netted with it are then cafily replaced.

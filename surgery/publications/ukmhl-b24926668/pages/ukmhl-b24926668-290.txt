The bladder being thus laid bare, make a traufverfe incilion through the coats of it, directly upon the ftone, when, by prcffing the fingers in the rcdlum on the ft one, it will be forced out. Heiftcr fays, this method is practicable in boys under fourteen years of age. He always performed it on children, and recommends it to be pradtifed on adults, when the ft one cauhs a fiipprclhon of urine, by its adhering to the neck of the bladder; but other- wife, it is dangerous to adults. It is, however, i'cl- dom or never adopted in modern practice. The mode by the greater apparatus was; < thus : The patient being properly fecured, a grooved ftaff was introduced through the urethra into the bladder; the handle of the inftrument was carried over the right groin, while its convex part was made to pulh out the urethra on the left fide of the peri- neum. The ftaff was preferved in this fituation by an affiftant, who likewife fufpended the ferotum; while the operator, with a fcalpel in his right hand, made an incilion from the very bottom of the ferotum, to within a finger’s breadth of the anus, carrying it along the left fide of the perinseum, within a very little of the rapha. Now the urethra was opened at its bulb, by turning the back part of the knife to- wards the reftum, and cutting with the edge of it' diredtly into the groove of the llaff; and the incifion was then completed, by carrying it along to the ex- tremity of the urethra, at the commencement of the proftate gland.

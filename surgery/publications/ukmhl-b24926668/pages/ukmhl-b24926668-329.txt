O P H veiling of the eye-lids fubfide, they apply to them ooiing ointmdits and emollient cataplafms; at the line time, they repeat gentle purgatives as often as ,.te patient’s ftrength, Sec. feemsto require. Leeches re applied to the temples, and a blifter between the •loulders, is kept open as long as a tendency to a dii- harge of mucus in the eye appears. When the tur- idnefs of the eye-lids abates, and the inflammation ;f the conjunctiva difappears, the decoft. cort. 'cruv. is given inwardly, and collyriums directed .::at arc of an aftringent kind, and tiled three or four :mes a day. Though bliiters arc generally applied, ;mc have from an extensive practice concluded, that deir conllant omillion would be no difadvantage to .ae patient. Mr. Ware propofes on the flrft attack i begin with refilling the difeharge of mums, by rengthening the external coat of the eye. To this nd, he diredts the eye to be cleared of the morbid mcm, by injecting into it by a fyringc, a gentle af- ringent collyrium; in particular, he prefers the aq. upri, vitriolat. camphorat. diluted with common /ater, in the proportion of a dram, lei’s or more, to wo ounces. This pradticc he tiles in all the Stages f the difeafe. As the matter incrcafcs, the colly - ium may be ufedmore frequently, and gradually in- reafed in its ftrength : in a flight calc, it may be ufed wo or three times a day, but in the more malignant imes, it may be repeated every hour, and tiic tlyp- icity or lhe collyrium may be increafed in propor- icn ; as the difordcr gives way, the ftrength of the aedicine, and the frequency of ullng.it, may both edccreafcd. To abate the (welling of the eye-lids, Ar. Ware prefers a cataplafm of the coaguluin alu- ainof. & ungt. flor. lamb. an. p. aeq. this lhould be pplied cold.

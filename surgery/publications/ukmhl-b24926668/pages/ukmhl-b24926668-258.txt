HYP mation. The matter is confined in a bag, or cyft, or, at Ieaft, is always confined to one part of tile eye, which is obferved to be elevated into the form of. an ordinary abfeefs, while the reft of the eye retains its ufual form. As jion as the matter is clear iy furineJx an incifion muft be made in the mod depending part of the abfeefs, and after the contents are, evacuated, the parts muft be covered with a foft comp refs moiftened, with a weak fclution of the ccrus aceta^, and e\cry part of the antiphlogoftic regimen muft be followed, till the wound in the'eye is completely cured. If a fungus a riles where the opening was made, apply a little burnt alum, finely powdered, or any other, mild can flic. Avoid delay in performing this opera- tion, as the matter of the abicefs may burft inwardly, and totally annihilate every degree of vifion. Vide y.

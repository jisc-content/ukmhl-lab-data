POL tachmcnt, from which they hang, and it is very finall; this muft be brought away with the polypus, which commonly happens in the ektraftion of it, if the forceps take hold high enough. If it is hard, and appears fchirfus, it will in general be found to -hare a broad bafts, and be unfit in every rei'peft to meddle with ; but if it is of th2t innocent kind juft mentioned, its attachment is ul’ually in the anterior pails of the nefe, let,the prjjpus appear where it will, it will he beft extracted antcrioiily, ior few can bear the introduftion of the forceps up behind the uv tila. Mr. Sharp direfts the following method of extraft- irlg apo'jpu.: “ Intrcduce a pair of forceps with a Iht at their extremities (for the better hold, an inch and a half up the noftril, tolccuie tlie pohpus as near the roots as may be; then twift them a little from one. i lie to the other, and continue this aftion while you pull gradually downwards ; if it breaks, repeat the extraction as long as any remains unlefs it is at- tended with a violent haemorrhage, which is an ac- cident that fometjmes happens, and rarely fails, if ihe pti\pus is become feirrhus; this hatmerrhage is Icon abated by the contraction of the vcffcls, or the application of lint dipped in feme ftyptic.” Jt may be known that the pjl'.pns is removed, id, By the hght; idly, By the voice; and ydly, By ihc free- dom of refpiration through the nefe. Jn introducing the forceps it is difficult to avoid the clfa lpongiofa ; but to lluin them, keep the beak of the forceps as rear as polfiblc to the os palati. When the operator ■raws away the polypus, he may generally bring it | ’.way whole, if he draws and moves it very gently, tf any of the polyptU remains, touch it with the ar- jent. nitrat.

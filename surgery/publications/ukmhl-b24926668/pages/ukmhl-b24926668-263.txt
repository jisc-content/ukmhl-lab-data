INF Vlr. Sharp obferves, in his Introduction to the Ope- rations of Surgery, that, “ A l'cirrhous gland is, ge- nerally mentioned as a fourth termination of inflam- mation ; but with impropriety, fincc it fcldom of never occurs but in venereal, fcrophulous, or cancerous safes, when it is the forerunner, and not the conic- ;^nence of an inflammation, the tumour generally ap- iocaring before the difcolouration.” One general method of cure is that which is proper n all the denominations of phlegmonous influmma- "icns, however diftinguifhed by phlegmon, eryftpelas, zsedema, or whatever elfe. And, in general, there ure but two indications-; the firft is to leffen or re- move the irritation ; the fecond is to abate the in- zrcafed afflux of< the humours. Though inflammations of all parts and kinds have die fame general treatment in order to their cure, yet -regard fliould be had to their ftru&urc, fituation, ■and-connection of the parts, to the antecedent cauTcs of the difordcr, and the conftirution of the .patient. It is obfervable, that a phlegmon, on its decline, affumes fucccliively the forms of an eryftpelas and noedema, and then it-vanifhes; this would not happen fo foon if they proceeded from infpiffated blood, le- rum, or' lymph, wedged in l'maller veifels than i ddtined to circulate'them ; whence, as thefc different appearances of inflammation are known to arifc'fuc- ■ ccffivcly in the fame place, it,feenis very certain that they proceed from the fame caufe, viz. from the fame kind of humours in the fayne , feries of vcffels,'and t-hat they arc nothing elfe but the different degrees of intenfity-'of the fame1 clifcafc, alfo that the lame ge- neral method of cure is proper for them ajl. • To anfwcr the fnjt indication, viz. to remove the irritating caufe, i.

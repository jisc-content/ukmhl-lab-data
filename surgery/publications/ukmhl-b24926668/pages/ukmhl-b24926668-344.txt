POL blood veffels, arc not found till the body is dying. Thofe that are the fubje&s of manual operations, their feat is in the nofe, the uterus, and the vagina. A polypus in the nofe, has been called noli me fang ere, far coma, and byprr/arcoma ; but the polypus is always loft, and hangs by one or more (lender roots; the l'arcoma is fumerimes foft, but generally, hard, and is fixed on a large immoveable bafts. The polypus of the nofe is an excrefccnce whole branches fpread among the lamina; of the os ethmoi- dcs, and through the whole cavity of one or both noftrils.

The catifes may be external > r internal; the ex- ternal are chiefly fome violence done to the pituitary membrane, the application of ftimulating drugs there- to, and blows, Scratches, Ike. Internal caufes are, acrid defluxions, frequent or profufe hemorrhage, &c. DilFeronf p'ypufes, and the fame at different timet, appear of different lizcs and confidences; their elon- gation is fometimes fo quick, that they appear below the noftrils in two or three days; for the moft part they are free from pain, vet fometimes they arc at- tended with both pain and hardnefs, and then they generally are difpcfcd to a cancer, in which cafe, they arc of a livid colour, and apt to bleed by the flighted touch. When a polypus appears foft, and of a pale colour, like the ferum of the blood, being alfo free from pain, it then is the beft kind, and in the moft proper ftatc to extract; thefe havo rarely more than one at- tachment,

E X O there may be no vacuum. Thefe different ftages, taken together, conflitute ulceration. When any part of a bone is once loofe, it will be pufhed to the f'utface in the fame manner as moft other inanimate bodies would be, and this flagc is partly mechanical, partly a con- tinuation of ulceration. A proof of the third ftage abovementioned, may be derived from thole calcs where people die while exfoliation is going on. A fmall groove, or worm-eaten canal can then be difeovered, which becomes gradually deeper, and follows the irregularities <sf the living and dead fur- faces. After the application of the trepan, a circu- lar piece of, bone is frequently thrown off, which is always lefs than the fpace from whence it camel. This however, would never be the cafe, were there not a lofs of fublfance.” When a bone is laid bare by anv accident, and an exfoliation is feared, if fcvcral perforations are made in the bone, the exfoliation will be prevented ; in fuch cafes, the wound ihould be kept clean, and defended from undtuous and and watery medicaments ; pledgets of lint arc as proper applications as any; or they may be dipped in a mixture of the ol. tertb. and tindf. myrrh. As to caufiics, Mr. Hunter fays, that “ cauftics, or the adfual cautery, do neither of them haften exfoli- ation ; they produce deatli only in part of the hone, which is the firft ffep towards exfoliation. I f canIbcs ever haften exfoliation, where the bone is already dead, it muft be bv producing inflammation in the adjacent living hone j this brings about a change in it, and makes it exert a power which it was incapa- ble of before.” Vide article Cakiks. Exostosis, from e-, of, or out, and oa bone'. It is a preternatural excrcfcence of a bone, or a tu- mour on a bone. Mr. Pott calls it an enlargement of the bone. Its hardnefs equals, or rather exceedsJ that of the bone from which it proceeds. The (xojlq/ii fee ms to be cauicd by the difchargeii t oil

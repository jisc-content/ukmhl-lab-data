xpophyjh; and, as feme fay, a fourth, viz. tllflicbia. Tidearticle Blepharoptosts. The fridlion of the eye-la(hcs in this cafe, brings m defluxions and inflammations, if not prevented by >ulling out the hairs, one by one, at fuch diftances of ime, as may be ncceflary for preventing inflamma- tion. In Dr. Cullenâ€™s Nofology, this difeafe is an in- rance of fymptomatic ophthalmy, called ophthalmia riebiujis. Mr. Ware, in his remarks on the ophthalmy, &c. Jiftinguilhes as follows, betwixt the inverfion of the jipper and under eye-lids, both as to the caufe and tire: and fpeaks, .Fir ft, of the inverfion of the. upper lid. }The upper lid and its ciliary edge (he obferves) are preferred, both in motion and reft, in their na- ural fituation, by the equal, though contrary, adtions T the mufculus orbicularis, and levator palptbrae uptrioris. The fkin of the upper lid is always very bin, flaccid, and folded. When, therefore, the triebia- 'is aftedts the .upper lid, it appears to be produced by i-relaxation of the levator palpcbne fuperioris, and a rOntradfion of the fuperior part of the orbicularis. The cure, either in the upper or lower lid, is palli- ative, or radical. It is only palliative, when, in order . ro relief, the eyc-la(hcs are cxtradled by their roots. The radical cure is affcdled by detradfing the ciliary edges, and prelerving them in their natural fituation. IThe caufe being a relaxation of the levator palpebrs l ftiperioris mufcle, an incifion rnuft be made through the integuments of the upper eye-lid, from the inner angle of the eye to the outer ; then the fibres of the orbicularis mufcle muft be fo fepatated, as to denu- date the expanded fibres of the levator mufcle, as near to their termination in the edge of the lid as ! polfible ; which being done, apply a fmall cautcrifing > iron, adapted to the convexity of the globe of the 0 o 3 eye,

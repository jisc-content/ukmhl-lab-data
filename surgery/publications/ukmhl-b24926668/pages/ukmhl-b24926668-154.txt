end of the humerus with one hand, and by taking hold, j of the wrift and bending the elbow with the other; ! and if it is on either fide, the hand of the patient nauft ■ be turned inward or outward, at the fame inltant, as j the cafe requires. After reduction, the arm Ihould be, j hung in a iling for fome time, that the parts may re- cover their tone. The bones of the fore-arm arc alfo liable tube diflo- cated in their connection with each other. At the joint of the elbow, a projecting part of the radius is lodged, and moves in a cor re! ponding cavity of the ulna, and below, a portion of the ulna is received by a fimilar cavity in the radius. In fiances have occurred of thefe bones being feparated from each other at both, thefe points of connection ; but it is more apt to hap- j pen at the wrift than at the tlbow. When it occurs, the ufual fymptoms of diflocation arc prefent; pain, fw el ling, diftortion, and impaired motion. The bone is calily replaced, but difficult to retain; therefore, when the bone is reduced, a iplint, to reach from the. elbow to the tops of the fingers, Ihould be placed on the infide and outfide of the arm ; fecure them by a flannch roller, and let the arm hang iu a fling. D: (locations of the Bones of I be Wrift. Di (locations of thefe bones are not very frequent; but when they occur, they are moft generally outward. The three fuperior carpal bones may be dilplaced at their con- ii 'ion with the ulna and radius, or they may bsj feparated from the five inferior bones pf the wrift. Sometimes, one or more of thefe bones are teparatodj from each other; and in fome rnftahces, they ar: diflocated at their connection with the bones of the metacarpus, and the fuperior hone of the thumb. To reduce thefe bones, let the arm and hand be iup- ported by two affiftants, who muff keep the parts firm, but not ftrctch them, ‘and in this funation, bones arc cafily pufhed into their places.

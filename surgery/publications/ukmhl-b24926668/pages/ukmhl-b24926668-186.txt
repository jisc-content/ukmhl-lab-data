EXT Tt-ffcls : thus an ecchymofis, or ancurifm, may be called extrapolations. An fxtraiahtion on the brain, produces one or more of the following fymptoms, viz. a palfy of one leg or arm, or both ; dizzinefs ; fleepinefs ; impaired light; ravings ; bleeding at the nol'e oi cars ; vomit- ing; lofs of l'enfe ; ftupor, &c. Vide Article CERE- BRI COMPRF.SSIO. r j An extramnfation on the brain fliould be diftinguilhed- from a conculfion ; in the firft, the fymptoms are often ] better and worfe; in the latter, they are continually j the fame. Wounds on the head, with rxtravo/ations, arc very j fallacious, becaule the exiravo/a/ion may be between ] the Ikull and the dura mater, or under it, both at the,! lame time, nr under the pia mater, or in fcveral other ' parts of the brain; but when thei'e happen, bad ■ lymptoms are direftly produced. Whenever the dura mater, cither bv dcprclfton, J fnTure, or frafturc, kifcs its adhefion, there will be '3 from its blood vcfiels that ate broken, an extravnfo* j i.~<m between the bone and it. An ext‘rorJnJation is J lsfs confidcrable, when a feature of the fkull hap- 1 pens than when there is a failure. An extrainfation . is alfo more or lets dangerous, according to what part . of the brain the accident happens on. Extrarca/ationi 1 from a blow are moll commonly found under the jJ Ikull, that is, between it and the dura mater; in J this cafe, a lethargy or fymptom will continue, until I the tx/rerVofition is removed. Mr. Brumfield recommends the ufe of opiates in j fradturcs and eonculTiuns of the brains (vide Cos- j cu'ssio); the fame pra&iee may be alfo ufeful in I fame degrees of extrwva/ation ; hut, bcfules this, he I obferves, that when violent accidents have happened 1 to the head, an iffuc in the opening formed by the J reparation of the addiramentum of the temporal bone | i f fingular advantage.

This may happen iu almoft any point of the fore part of the belly, but is mod frequently found between the refti mufcles, either above or below the navel. It is generally large, and is only to be relieved by returning the protruded parts, and preventing their return by a proper bandage. The tumour which requires this opera- tion, is fcldom bigger than a walnut ; fo when there arc the fymptoms of a hernia, and yet no appearance of one in the groin, the belly ihoitld be examined. The manner of relieving the ftridture will be by di- lating the part, as in other cafes. But after the ope- ration, a bandage mud always be worn, as the cica- trix cannot be trullcd to.

Dr. Cullen places this genus of difeafe, in the clafs locales, order dialyfes, and de- fines it, pklrflrnec, or a great number or fmall ul- cers, crowding together, creeping, and difficult to heal. Mr. Bell, in his Trcatife on Ulcers, places the tinea and the herpes, as varieties in his fpcciesof ulcer, which he denominates cutaneous. He further ob- ferves, that the cutaneous ulcer may in all its varieties be included in the four following ; viz. 1. The herpes farinofus ; which includes what fome call the dry tet- tar. 2. Herpes puBulofus ; which include, the crufta laftca, and the time capitis. 3. Hopes miliaris; of| this variety is the ulcerous eruption called the ring- worm.

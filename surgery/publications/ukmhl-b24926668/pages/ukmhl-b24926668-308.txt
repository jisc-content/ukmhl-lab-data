L U E adminlftered. Thefe ulcers are not unfreqnently ob- ftinatc, and do not heal, although every venereal lymptom has difappeared : here we may fufpeft the prei’encc of fonie other difeafe, and that both have had their fliarc in producing, as well as continuing the ulcer. As foon as the difeafe is dii'covcrcd, the proper remedies for its removal muft be directed; and then a cure will foon be accompliihcd. It may be that the fores will’ not heal, though no other dif- eafe is attendant, but from the free ufe of mercury,. &c. the body is enfeebled ; here the bark, with a notirilhing diet, a pure air, and moderate cxcrcife, may be tried, and ufualiy fucccfs will be the refult. If the fljughs cn thefe ulcers are tough, dreffings that gently ftimmate, w 11 be required ; e. g. R Ung. Rtfln Fiav. Jj. hydrargyr. nitrat. rub. 3?j. m. When the lloughs arc calt off, and a proper difeharge is pro- duced, chefs wicU luch other means as the then liars, of the lore requires. When a gland is the feat of a general ulcer, a kindly fuppuration is then difficultly produced, and fumctirr.es a cure cannot be performed, without deftroying at leaft a 1 the hardened part of it. This is beff done by repeated applications of the ar- gent. nitrat. which may be repeated every third or fourth day. (/'cnereat ulcers, whether in buboes, chancres, or other- wife, when they appear cancerous, will gradually give way by the ufe of frclh air, a fuller diet, abfti- ncnce from mercury, or by means of hemlock ap- plied outwardly, or given inwardly, whether with or without opiates. Sometimes, a more fpcedy effect has been obferved from eating fix or more lemons in a day. See fome Obfcrvations of this kind in the Lond. IVled. Tranf. vol. ii. p. 338, &c.

I s c Spafms arc- removed by fomentations, the warm ,ath, demulcents, gtyRers, antifpafmpdics, aiid nodynes. When the urine is totally retained in the bladder, : is too common a pradlice to advife to introduce the athetcr; but whether this complaint arifes from in- .animation or from 1'pafm, this c*ndu£! lhould carp- sally be avoided.

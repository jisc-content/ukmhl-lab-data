An extenfion made downwards, or even hori- zontally, more frequently fails than when it is made in fonric degree upward. When the I’tX’iion is forward, that is, when the head of the humerus is under the peftoral mufeie, there is a cavity under the acromion, but the head of the luxated bone projects towards the bread, more than when juft in the axilla; and if the arm is moved, a moie acute pain is felt than in the pre- ceding cafe ; for the great artery and the arms of the nerve^ arc much pvefled. If this kind of lux- . ati an is not eaftiy reduced by the method dire died, i when the head of the humerus is in the arm-pit, let a puily from the top of a room be faftened to the j arm, juft above the elbow of the luxated arm, and * the patient gradually railed from the ground by it; ; this at lcalt brings the head of the humerus into thd j axilla,whence,asab' vedirefted,it maybereftored into its proper place.

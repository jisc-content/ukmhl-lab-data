The pre- fence of a fluid in the abdomen is known by the levelling it produces; by a fcnfc of tightnefs in the parts affeCtcd; by the breathing being difficult and laborious, efpecially when in an horizontal polture; and by a fenie of fluctuation being communicated to the lingers placed on one fl.de of the abdomen, when tl}Â£ ("welling is forcibly ftruck on the oppofite fide. A concurrence of rhcic circumftances point out the real nature of the difordcr; but a farther confirma- tion of it is obtained, when the patient complains of much third, a drv ikin, fcarcity of urine, and other fymptoms of dropfy. As loon as a fluctuation is dif- tinCfly felt, the operation may be performed. Per* haps if it was always recurred to at an early period, an effectual cure might frequently be obtained. A hidden difeharge of any kind of fluid, where', er fituatcd, but particularly in the abdomen, is hazard- ous, producing fyncope, and lomerimcs death. This is, perhaps, owing to.the immediate influence produced upon the circulating l'yftem, by a confnle- rablc part of it being too quickly deprived of a iup- porr-which it has long been accultomcd to receive.

Sometimes, by the violence of the irritation, the fecretion of mucus feems to be totally fufpended, or at leaft confidcrably diminifhed, fo that no dif- eharge, or only a very ftnall one, takes place, though the other fymptoms rage with the utmoft violence. In this cafe, the difeafe has obtained the very im- proper name of gonorrhoea (icca.

It is as follows : “ Dr. Stoll had, about the year 17S2, the inftiudlivc opportunity of dif- fering a man who died while labouring under a virulent gonorrhoea.

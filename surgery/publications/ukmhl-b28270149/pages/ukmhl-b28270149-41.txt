Operation practised by Diejf 'enbach. 27 the two lateral sections of the sphincter. I am the more sanguine as to the general result of this operation, since I had the good fortune to apply ligatures successfully to an old laceration of the rectum into the vagina, without the assistance of the method which I have now described, and therefore under circumstances considerably less fa- vourable. Much, after all, in such an operation depends upon causes over which the surgeon has a very imperfect control. Inflammation of the parts supervening, or diarrhoea, would still be liable to render the operation ineffectual. But the surgeon of course defers attempting it, till the patient is in her best state of health, and the bowels have been thoroughly un- loaded by repeated doses of opening me- dicine. The bowels should not be moved for several days after the operation.

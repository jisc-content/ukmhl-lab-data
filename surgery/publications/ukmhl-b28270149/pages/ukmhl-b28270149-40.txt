26 Complete Rupture of the Sphincter. In cases of long standing it is however obvious, that the lateral division of the sphincter is a part only of the operation requisite for the restoration of the parts. It is necessary besides, at the least, to produce a granulating surface upon the edges of the fissure. And as the parts in this class of cases have lost, from time, the tendency which exists in the freshly-torn parts to come together, I conclude that it is absolutely necessary to use ligatures to bring them and to hold them in contact.

The first step of the operation consists in paring the edges of the fissure: the second is the introduction of sutures, to be tied afterwards in the vagina: the third is the division of the sphincter on either side: the operation is completed by tying the ligatures in the vagina, and by introducing a strip of lint into each of

198 Treatment. Solid opium, the acetate and muriate of morphia, the extract of stramonium, are each in their turn available. Opiates act more promptly and efficiently in this dis- ease when taken into the stomach, than when applied in injections or suppositories to the rectum. If administered in the latter form, the subacetate of lead may be advantageously combined with them. The bowels are to be regularly relieved. In general a drachm of the lenitive elec- tuary taken over-night, with an injection of tepid water the following morning, if it can be used without pain, will be sufficient for this purpose. When these means fail, stronger purgative medicines must be em- ployed. But the next object to relieving the bowels in all disorders of the rectum, is, not to irritate them by exciting unnecessary ac- tion. A few drops of laudanum should be taken immediately after the action of the bowels.

Complete Rupture of the Sphincter. 25 the operation for fistula ani. A small strip of lint was introduced into each wound. The edges of the original rent were after- wards washed daily with a solution of nitrate of silver, and fresh lint was replaced in the incisions as often as it was removed by the passage of faeces. The original rent healed very speedily: when it was nearly closed, the lateral wounds were allowed to unite. In five weeks from the operation the incisions had healed, and the patient had recovered the use of the sphincter. She has continued perfectly well to the present time, and was safely confined of another child in Novem- ber 1832. The remarkable success which has at- tended this practice in recent cases, has induced me to determine to employ it, after the manner recommended by Dief- fenbach, in cases in which laceration of the sphincter has occurred, and has not been remedied at the time.

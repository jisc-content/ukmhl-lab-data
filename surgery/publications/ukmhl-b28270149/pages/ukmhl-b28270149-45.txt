Protrusion of the Rectum. 31 may take place even when the sphincter is entire, and when the bowel has not lost the support which it affords. If the contents of the bowel are habi- tually too firm and solid, in passing through the extensible canal they temporarily drag it with them, and elongate its adhesions to the adjacent surfaces. Nature indeed has aimed at providing against this occurrence, by throwing round those portions of the alimentary canal, which are intended to hold solid contents, a strong coat of longi- tudinal fibres.

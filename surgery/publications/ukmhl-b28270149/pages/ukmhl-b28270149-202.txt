CHAP. VIII. OF CANCER OF THE RECTUM. The most formidable disease of the rec- tum, from its severity, its fatal character, and its frequency, is carcinoma. This complaint is liable to occur at every pe- riod of life. I have seen it in one instance at the age of twelve; most frequently between the ages of twenty and forty; but hardly less often at a more advanced period of life*. * At the Middlesex Hospital there is a separate endowment, originating in munificent donations by the grandfather of William Whitbread, Esq. M. P. and by the late Mrs. Stafford, for patients afilictedwith cancer; on which account a great number of patients afflicted with carcinoma apply at that institution for admission or relief.

146 Of the Introduction rendered perfectly pliant and flexible by immersion in hot water. Except in this state, a bougie cannot be introduced with safety beyond four inches into the rectum. Even when it has been rendered pliant, a bougie introduced into the intestine gene- rally meets with some degree of obstruction after passing from five to six inches. The nature of this obstruction is readily shown by anatomical inspection. The end of the instrument catches against the lax walls of the rectum, and pushes before it the sub- stance of the gut as a blind sac.

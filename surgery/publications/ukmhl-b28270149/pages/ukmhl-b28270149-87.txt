to be attended to. IS If there are several internal piles, it is necessary that all should be tied. After tying a pile, the ligature is to be cut short, and the ends are to be returned with the strangulated pile into the rectum. If much pain follow the operation, it may be allayed by a dose of laudanum. The pain generally in a short time subsides entirely; and it is only requisite for the patient to remain at rest for the next few days, when the ligatures and the piles come away without his knowledge. But occasion- ally fresh pain supervenes on the second or third night. When this happens, it is pre- sumable that the pile has not been entirely strangulated : the parts should then be ex- amined, and the ligature should either be removed for the time, or drawn closer, ac- cording to the state of the parts. If much pain supervene after tying piles, it is al- ways safe and useful to apply leeches to the extremity of the bowel.

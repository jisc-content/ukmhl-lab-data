110 Sinus external to the Sacrum. extended upwards for a length of five inches between the skin and the os sacrum. This patient was of a good constitution, and the bone was not diseased : she at- tributed the complaint to a blow which she had accidentally received. I tried by pressure to obliterate the sinus, but it was ineffectual. I then laid open the sinus for an inch and a half at its lower part, and made a counter opening at the upper part, and left for a week a few threads drawn with a probe through the undivided part of the sinus. During this period poultices were applied. The threads were then with- drawn, pressure was made, and the part healed rapidly. The part of the sinus which was divided healed like a common fistula : it granulated from the bottom, the integument uniting the last. The original indisposition to heal and the cure in fistula turn on the same principles as in this case.

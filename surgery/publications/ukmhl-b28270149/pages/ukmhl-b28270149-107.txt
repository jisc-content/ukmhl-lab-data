Case. 93 evacuating the bowels. On one occasion, the sufferings of the patient became ag- gravated by the sudden oedematous swell- ing of the skin around the anus as a thick and acutely sensible fold or collar, the least pressure or contact upon which caused pain. In this instance free scarification was practised; by which the distension was relieved, and the tenderness of the part subsided with the distension. In the class of cases of external piles which I have described, the tumour is in- deed always without the sphincter, and is for a greater or less extent of its surface covered with the common integument; but its situation is marginal, so that it is in part covered with an extension of the mucous membrane. But there is another class of cases, in which the tumour is entirely co- vered with the skin, and is more detached from the sphincter muscle and the border of the anus.

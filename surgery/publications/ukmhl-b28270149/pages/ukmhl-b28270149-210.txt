196 Second Variety of the Disease. Fungoid scirrhus at its commence- ment generally occupies a portion only of the circumference of the bowel, and is felt as a hard tumour situated about three inches within the gut and com- monly upon its anterior surface, with the mucous membrane as yet unbroken. The growth of the scirrhus is liable to ex- tend in each direction, upwards to the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and down- wards so as to implicate the anus and to throw the adjacent integument into firm hard knots. Similar disease sometimes ori- ginates in and is confined to the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and is occasionally met with at parts of the great intestine still higher. In either form of the disease, the fat external to the rectum is liable to assume a firm and crisp texture, resembling the state of the adipose membrane met with around a cancerous mamma.

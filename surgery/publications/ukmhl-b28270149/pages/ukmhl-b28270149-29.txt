Case. 15 remain others which are available. The edges of the opening having become cica- trized, and the use of escharotic or stimu- lating applications having been disconti- nued, the following operation may be re- sorted to. The edges of the opening may be pared off with curved scissars, and one or two stitches may be passed through the vaginal side of the opening, so as to bring the edges of the rent into close and un- interrupted contact. It is conceivable, that in certain cases of this description it may be necessary to lay the vagina completely into the rectum by dividing the sphincter from the perforation. I have not however met with an instance which required this treatment. The origin of the following case, I am disposed to think, may have been a small opening suddenly taking place through the rectum into the adjacent cellular tissue.

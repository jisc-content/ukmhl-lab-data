The change from the healthy to the diseased state on the side towards the anus is often very gradual. Above, the diseased structure always ter- minates abruptly, meeting a raised uneven ulcerated edge of mucous membrane.

The scirrhous matter, grey, fibrous, not perfectly opaque, gristly, as in the first kind, is of a looser and more suc- culent texture.

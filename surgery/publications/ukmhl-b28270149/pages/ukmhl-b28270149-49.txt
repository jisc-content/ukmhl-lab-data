Invagination. 35 is to be ascribed the frequency with which they suffer from prolapsus. The com- plaint therefore when occurring in children may be viewed as one to which their time of life renders them liable, and the disposi- tion to which will spontaneously cease as they grow up. Nevertheless, as protrusion of the bowel by no means takes place in children indiscriminately, but in those only who either are of a very delicate constitution, or who labour under habitual constipation of the bowels, the complaint always requires attention. The more so, that although it is to be expected that the disposition towards it will cease with child- hood, it is always possible that the habit of eversion may become in time so esta- blished in the part, and the part extruded gradually acquire so great a volume, as to require for its relief more serious measures than are necessary if the complaint be taken in time. d 2

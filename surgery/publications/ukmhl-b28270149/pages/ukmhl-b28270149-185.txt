to force a Stricture. 171 but it is utterly unjustifiable on any ground: it can be used only through a mistake of the principle of dilatation; the object of which is not mechanically to stretch the narrowed canal, but to excite the absorption of that which thickens and contracts it. In some instances the process of dilata- tion is very slowly accomplished; the stric- ture being sharp, firm, and narrow. There is a variation of treatment applicable to such cases, which consists in dividing the stricture in one or more places with a probe-pointed knife. The effect of this operation is for the time to give consi- derable freedom to the passage through the stricture. But the incisions quickly repair themselves ; and the part again con- tracts, unless prevented by the use of the bougie. The following is a case in which I em- ployed this practice successfully.

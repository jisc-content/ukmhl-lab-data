CHAP. VI. OF CONSTIPATION OF THE LOWER BOWELS, AND OF THE USE OF INSTRUMENTS. The disorders which have been treated of in the preceding sections—fissure of the rectum, laceration, bleeding, hemorrhoids, fistula ani — would admit of being loosely classed together as occasional results of one common cause, namely, constipation of the lower bowels.

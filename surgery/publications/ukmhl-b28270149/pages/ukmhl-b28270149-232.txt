The tumour now grew rapidly, and the patient gra- dually sank. At three inches from the orifice of the gut, the bowel was perfectly sound. The disease was fungoid scirrhus. In fungoid scirrhus the morbid growth occasionally deviates in parts from the character which has been above assigned to it, and is, with complete opacity, whiter, and of a more doughy consistence. But this appearance is rare ; and it is still rarer to meet with true medullary disease con- fined to or originating in the rectum.

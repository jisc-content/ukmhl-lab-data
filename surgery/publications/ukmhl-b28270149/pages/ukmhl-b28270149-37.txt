It is known in such a case that all the fibres of the sphincter are torn through, by the total want of tonic con- traction of the bowel at the part where it begins to be entire. In many instances in which this accident happens, spontaneous reparation of the part does not take place. The force of the sphincter muscle is employed in keeping the rent wide open; and the faeces continually passing through it contribute to prevent its uniting. In a conversation with Mr. Copeland, I learnt, that in a case of this description he had successfully employed the following method. It occurred to him, that if the sphincter were divided at a second part, its strain upon the rent into the vagina would be greatly lessened, and that the chance of

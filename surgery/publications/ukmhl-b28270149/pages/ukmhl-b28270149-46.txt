Protrusion of the Rectum. 32 a mass of solid feces will carry through the rectum an everted fold : this, it is true, at first spontaneously returns; but the cause continuing, the eversion becomes more certain and considerable at each re- currence of action of the bowels. A gentleman, whose case I have de- scribed (Case II), in addition to the fissure in the inner membrane of the rectum, la- boured under prolapsus. Both affections had proceeded from the same cause, and were relieved at the same time by the same means. His brother, whom I happened to attend for the effects of a severe accident, mentioned to me, that whenever it hap- pened to himself that the bowels were con- fined, more or less protrusion of the rectum invariably took place. Thus, in its slightest form, this complaint admits of being reme- died, and its recurrence prevented, by ob- viating the costiveness which has pro- duced it.

Laceration of the Rectum by Instruments. 19 The rectum may be torn through from within, by violence done in the improper use of instruments. I removed a stone from the bladder of a boy fourteen years of age by the lateral operation. The stone, which was of a favourable shape, was extracted quickly. Every thing went on satisfactorily till the eighth day, when escape of fecal matter into the cellular membrane, as in the case above described, is probably the rarest. I have seen two instances in which sudden swelling of the scrotum, which came and gradually subsided, was not attributable to either of these causes, or to any local cause that was detected. In one in- stance I have seen the scrotum enormously distended with blood from violence done to the part. In another, the perineum and scrotum were distended and disco- loured with blood and serum that had escaped at the lower outlet of the pelvis, after fracture of the ilium, which had lacerated the internal iliac vein. In another instance a child of five years of age was brought into the hospital with extensive swelling and sloughing of the scrotum and integuments of the penis, which had originated in phymosis and ulcers round the glans.

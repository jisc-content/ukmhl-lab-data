The following cases, condensed from the hospital record, are in- troduced in this connection as evidence upon the question how far the periosteum may be relied on to reproduce bone. In the first of these'cases the condyles of the humerus were regenerated so as to afford an excellent attachment for the muscles. In the second, a rhinoplastic operation, no new bone was formed. Case XII.—Periosteal Reproduction op the Condyles of the Humerus after Excision of the Elbow Joint. Sept. 14th, 1857. 0. P. E., aged 29, married, clerk. Is a light- liaircd, unhealthy-looking man. His family are liable to scrofulous affections. Five years ago, while at work hoisting goods, he struck his right elbow a violent blow, causing great pain. The elbow swelled, and he was laid up a fortnight. Since that time, whenever lie struck this joint, it would swell up in a similar manner. Last July, a fistulous opening appeared a little outside of the olecranon, and a week or two later a second one broke about two inches below the first. These discharge a thin, purulent thud. A probe passes under the skin from one opening to the other. No diseased bone is felt.

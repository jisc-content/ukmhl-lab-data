24 1. The reproduction of the condyles of the humerus by the peri- osteum, which was torn from the interstices of the surface of both the original condyles. The horns which were reproduced for the inser- tion of the extensors and supinators and of the flexors are conical processes, each somewhat more than half an inch in length, and regu- larly curved forwards and inwards, as seen in the accompanying wood-cut from a photograph of the bone. The rugous surface of the excised condyles is also shown.* 2. The unfavorable issue of this case corroborates what seems to be the fact, viz., that while the elbow is a most favorable joint for resection in cases of recent injury and in healthy subjects, yet when this articulation which is so near the centre of the circulation, and which should therefore be well nourished, and prompt to take on the reparative process, becomes carious from disease, it implies a general feebleness of constitution, which calls rather for amputa- tion than excision. Case XIII.â€”Periosteum op the Forehead Transplanted in a Rhino plastic Operation. No New Bone Formed. Necrosis of the Exposed Skull. Dec. 1st, 1866. A. B., aged 22. This young woman, at the age of ten years, was attacked witli scrofulous lupus, which resulted in the destruction of the principal part of the nose, including the boues and as far down as the aim. A hole of the size of a silver dime, sur- rounded with cicatricial tissue, exposes the nasal cavity.

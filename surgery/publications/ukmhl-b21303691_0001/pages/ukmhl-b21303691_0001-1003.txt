Dislocations of the sternal end of the clavicle in their order of frequency occur (a) forwards, (b) backwards, and (c) iipvjards. The rhomboid is the strongest ligament of the stei’no-clavicular articulation, and its fibres pass upwards, backwards, and out- wards. The attachments of this structure permit displacement forwards. The anterior sterno - clavicular Egament is comparatfroly weak. In abscess of the joint, for instance, displacement forwards readily occurs. The weakness of the anterior ligament ex- plains the frequency of traumatic displacement forwards. The posterior ligament is stronger; hence, displacement pos- teriorly is more infre- quent. The head of the clavicle cannot pass far backwards without rup- turing the rhomboid ligament, which needs great violence. In the dislocation upwaids the ihomboid ligament must, j-ig. 376.—Dislocation of the sternal End of the Clavicle ot course, be tom; hence, forwards, this displacement is very exceptional. Some anatomists believe that the inter-g,rticular •^rtilage foi-ms the strongest bond of union between the clavicle, the cartilage of the rib and the sternum; but a careful examination will lead one to the conclusion that the rhomboid ligament is the more important structure in this connection.

When complete, the head of the clavicle is thrown on the anterior surface of the sternum. The ligaments, especially the anterior, must be more or less torn, according to the completeness of the displacement. The inter-articular cartilage is either torn awav F F ^

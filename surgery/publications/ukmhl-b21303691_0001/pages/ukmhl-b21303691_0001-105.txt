QUANULATION TISSUE. 61 these cells, more especially at the parts most distant from the focus of inflammation, have a great tendency to become elongated and spindle- shaped, and to develop into fibrous tissue; and hence, in examining granulation tissue, it is seldom that one finds —unless it be in the very early stage, or at the focus of the inflam- mation—that there are only round cells and embryonic blood-ves- sels. It is most common to find at other parts of the inflammatory growth that more or less complete- fibrous tissue formation has taken place, and that the walls of the vessels have becomethickened, and considerable num- bers of them obliter- ated. This tissue Fig. 11.—Inflammation of Fat. Cells are accumulating between the fat cells, which are being compressed and disappearing; at some parts only a young cellular (granulation) tissue is to be seen. IS called gi'anulation tis- sue wherever it occurs, because its structure is exactly the same as that found in the granulations or buds on the surface of a healing sore (Fig. 8). As regards the origin of these granulation cells, much debate has taken place. Formerly it was held that the cells which formed the granu- lation tissue originated entii-ely from prolifera- tion of the connective tissue cells in the part, but when Cohnheim demonstrated the migra- tion of the white cor- puscles, many at once took up the view that these cells were leuco- , i 1 • , , , , cytes or derived from leucocytes which had passed out of the blood-vessels durino- the early stage. It is now, however, pretty generally held that leucocytes do not possess the function of forming permanent tissue, and that the cells Fig. 12.--Section of Granulation Tissue, showing its cellulav structure and the presence of numerous young vessels.

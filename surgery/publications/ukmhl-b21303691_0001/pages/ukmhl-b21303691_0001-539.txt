PSEUnO-GYSTS. 495 associated witli partial dislocation of the first phalanx it is known as a bunion, and bursse are quite common on the ends of ampu- tation stumps. A bursa is often present between the body of the hyoid and the thyro-hyoid membrane; sometimes it is as large as a ripe cherry. Burs® are liable to inflame, a process that may lead to suppura- tion, or stop short of that condition and become chronic or recurrent, and lead to secondary changes in the wall of the sac, so that its cavity becomes almost obliterated. A chronically-inflamed bursa sometimes attains the size of a fist, especially the prepatellar and ischial varieties. An enlarged prepatellar bursa sometimes rapidly thickens and its cavity becomes obliterated in the syphilitic. 3.

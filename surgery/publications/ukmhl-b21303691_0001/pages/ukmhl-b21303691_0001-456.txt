All scars, whether syphilitic or not, are most pigmented on the lower extremities, owing to the venous congestion of those parts. Tertiary ulcers of the legs are sometimes exceedingly difficult to Fig. 86.—Front of Knees, showiDg multiple scars due to relapsing gummatous ulcers. diagnose from ordinary inflammatory ones, and there is a form of scrofulous ulcer (known as Bazin’s disease) which has most of the characters above given. In fact, there is absolutely no conclusive feature about a syphilitic ulcer. The “ gummatous slough of connective tissue may be exactly imitated in some traumatic ulcers, or in carbuncular ones. A carbuncle is, however, almost invariably very painful before the skin gives way, whilst a gumma causes but little pain as a rule, and the former is much more acute in its progress. The ordinary chronic ulcer met with in subjects with varicose veins, and liable to long periods of standing at their work, occurs chiefly in the lower third of the leg j syphilitic ulcers may occur in the upper third, or over the calf. Gummatous ulcers are peculiarly apt to occur about the knee-joint (especially in women), sometimes over other joints, such as the elbow. These peri-synovial gummata may cause lumpy thickening of the joint-capsule, and even syno\nal

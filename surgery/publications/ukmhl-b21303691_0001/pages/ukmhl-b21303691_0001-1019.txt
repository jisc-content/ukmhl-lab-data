977 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. 3. Exteiisioii witli llie Iicel iii tlie axilla.—This simple and valuable method is often bungled in practice ; but if properly carried out, I would venture to look upon it as the simplest and most reliable method of reducing dislocations of the humerus. The anaesthetised patient must lie perfectly flat on a mattress, on the floor, and the surgeon, seated by his side, presses his unbooted heel, not his foot, against the head of the humerus, the arm being well carried from the side to allow of his doing so. It is of import- ance that he presses up no folds of skin in front of his heel, or Fig. 890.—Traction with the Knee in the Axilla. serious laceration may readily occur.

An additional assistant may easily draw upon the fore-arm, should this be required • and a strong towel may be fixed round the arm and hitched over the surgeons shoulders. Few, if any, recent dislocations will resist these endeavours. , , ^t**®*' inetliods of reduction.—These are very numerous but m this section we will only mention the followino-’ Extension of the limb, the scapula being pressed downwards by the hands of an assistant or the foot of the operator. This is an e icacious method, but throws a serious strain upon the axillary vessels, especia ly in dislocations of long standing. For this reason it should be adopted with caution. The patient being placed per- fectly supine upon a mattress laid on the table, the surgeon makes

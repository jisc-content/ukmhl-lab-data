OEONDROMATA. 453 cartilage. This genus contains three species : (1) Cliondromata ; (2) ecchondroses ; (3) loose cartilages in joints. , ^ , ^ 1. Chondromata.—Cartilage tumours in their most typical condition occur in connection with long bones, especially of the hands: and, as a rule, grow in the immediate vicinity of the epiphysial lines, hence they are most frequent in children and young Fig. 100.—Multiple Chondiomata. The lad was stunted from rickets. adults; they are often multiple (Fig. 100), but a solitary chondroma is not a rarity. Individuals with multiple chondromata often present evidences of rickets, and it is a curious cmcumstance that the tissue of a chondroma resembles, histologically, the bluish translucent cartilage so characteristic of a rickety epiphysial line. These tumours are always encapsuled, and form deep hollows in the bones with which they are connected: they are painless, grow slowly, and are firm to the touch. Mucoid degeneration is com- mon in them, and the softened parts may furnish slight fluctua- tion : this serves to distinguish them from osteomata with which

3-lS TUBERCULOSIS. Giant cells are not so characteristic of tubercle as is the bacillus, since they have been found incidentally in other lesions, such as chronically inflamed connective tissue. The bacilli are most common and most numerous in the giant cells. They may not be readily detected in the earliest stages of the Fig. 66.â€”Tubercle from Area a, Fig. 63. tubercle formation, but they are fairly well seen at a later period, when the giant cells are in evidence, and are often most distinct when the structural details of the part have been obliterated by caseation. It only remains to be said that the tuberculous process, when once established, is liable to indefinite extension. It usually spreads along the lymphatic channels, and follows lymphatic vessels. In gland disease, tubercles maybe readily found in the lymph canals which connect one infected gland with another; and it may be pos- sible to prove that the disease has been brought to the gland by lymphatics which have their origin in a tubercular lesion of the periphery

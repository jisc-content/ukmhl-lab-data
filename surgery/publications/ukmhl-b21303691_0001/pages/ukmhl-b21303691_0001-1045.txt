DISLOCATIONS OF THE nil. 1003 bone should be brought as close to the acetabulum as possible by flexion and traction, and then the ordinary manipulation methods sliould be applied. 3. Dislocation <lo\vn\var<1s aiicl forwards into the obtu- rator foranicn (Kgs. 409 and 410). Condition of soft parts.—The capsule is torn inferiorly, and the rent extends forwards and upwards, instead of backn’ards and upwards, ’ as in the case of the posterior dislo- cations. The ligamentum teres is torn away from the femur. The adductors, pectineus, and gracilis from the abduction of the femur are excessively tense and often lacerated. The ilio-psoas tendon is exceedingly tense ; the glutei and obturator in-. ternus, with the gemelli and pyri- formis, are much stretched. The head of the bone lies on the obtu- rator extemus muscle, pressing upon, tearing or stretching the obturator nerve. Causation.—This, is essentially the accident of extreme abduction. As has been explained, the first position of the head of the bone is downwards. If it move a little forwards, a thyroid dislocation occurs. This displacement can be readily manufactured in the cadaver by violent abduction. In practice it will be found to be caused by such accidents as falls with the legs widely apart, or stepping with one foot on to a boat which suddenly moves away from a pier. So, heavy weights falling upon the back, when the limbs are widely abducted, may produce an obturator dislocation. Symptoms.—The thigh is a little flexed, abducted, with the foot pointed forwards or everted (Ko- ductor longus, which stands out like ® Fig. 410.—Obturator Dislocation of tlte Hip. auctor longus, which stands out like a tight” corrTnd" Th/fold of /efS m the course of the obturator nerve.

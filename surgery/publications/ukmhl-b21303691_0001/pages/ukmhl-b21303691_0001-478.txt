It must not be supposed that, if untreated, gonorrhoea shows a strong tendency to come to an end in some three weeks or so. I have known many cases in which a first attack of gonorrhoea in a previously healthy and perfectly tem- perate man has lasted as a profuse purulent discharge for six months Fig. 93.—A, Epithelial and Pus Cells with Gonococci, from a Case of acute Gonorrhoea.

And looking to the many complications which may ensue, and especially to the danger of a resulting stricture if the gonococcus gets a firm hold of the urethral wall, it should be regarded as an' enemy to be attacked with vigour from the earliest date at which the patient comes under care. 1. The incubation stage.—Three to five days generally intervene between exposure to contagion and the earliest symptom noticed by the patient—a slight adhesion or stickiness of the lips of the meatus, accompanied by a tickling or burning sensation.* * This duration of the incubation period is remarkably regular in the cMe of ophthalmia of the newly-born, in whom the conjunctiva is infected by the maternal

477 WARTS AND PSAMMOMATA. Fig. 121.—Laryngeal 'Warts. cubical epithelium. Villous papillomata sometimes pos- sess broad bases, but often tlie points of attachment are so narrow that the tumour may be described as pedun- culated. These tumours may be single or multiple. In- stances are known in which villous papillomata of the renal pel'sds have been asso- ciated with similar smaller tumours of the vesical mucous membrane near the orifices of the ureters, probably due to epithelial infection. (See Art. LI., on Injuries and Diseases op the Urinary Organs, Vol. II.) A very interesting variety of villous papilloma arises from the choroid plexuses of the cerebral ventricles. When large, and situated in the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, they have produced pressure symptoms and death. These tumours rarely attain such size as to be fatal without undergoing calcification. 3. Intracystic papillo- mata.—The interior of all true cysts is lined with epi- thelium. Warts springing from the inner walls of cysts are not common, save in two situations — (1) cysts of the Dura mater mammary gland, (2) cysts of tlie Paroophoron and Gartner’s Psammoma duct. They have been observed in cysts arising in accessory thyroid glands. 4. Psammomata.— These are tumours composed of globular bodies, consisting of epithelial cells arranged in layers, usually calcified, and embedded in connective tissue (Fig. 122). Tliey are confined exclusively to tlie pia mater of the brain and spinal cord (Museum, Middlesex HospitaL) Pia mater Araclinoid Spinal cord

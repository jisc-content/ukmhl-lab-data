medicinal EUUFTIONS. 721 with the supernatant urine the cloudiness disappears and a quite characteristic lilac colour is seen for a time. The eruption quickly yields if an aperient saline be given and the balsam discontinued. ^ Guhehs may produce a very similar erythema, but ordinary doses of sandal-wood oil never cause it. Iodide of potassium, besides causing nasal catarrh and lacliryma- tion, and depressing the patientâ€™s mental and physical condition, may cause a pustular eruption resembling acne, and chiefly found in the regions affected by that disease. In some cases iodide (or bromide) leads to pus-secreting granulation growths, which may attain a most formidable size and appearance if the drug is pushed in ignorance of the cause of the eruption. It is especially common on the face ; but it must not be inferred that iodide eruptions are really very frequent. Considering the enormous number of patients who are prescribed iodide of potassium, any skin eruption as a result is quite a rarity, and for this reason is especially liable to be mistaken in diagnosis.

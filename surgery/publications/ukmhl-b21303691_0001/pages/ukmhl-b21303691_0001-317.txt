273 NITROUS OXIDE. (5) That anaBstlietic should be selected which is most suited to the i-emoved. particular case. _ i i (6) The mouth should be inspected, and artmcial teetn Tnadeauacy or absence of nasal breathing should not escape attention. (7) All constricting clothing should be unfastened, even for the most trifling operation. _ (8) Except in the case of dental and similar operations, the patient should be re- cumbent, in a comfort- able posture. A position half-way between the supine and lateral is often assumed for choice. The head should be turned to one side. (9) A third person should always be present during the administra- tion. (10) No case should be regarded as trivial. Difliculties and acci- dents may arise when anaesthetising a perfectly healthy patient with the safest known anaesthetic for a minor operation. (11) The anaesthetist should devote his undi- vided attention to his patient, and should take Qo part in the operation. (12) He should have at hand :—(a) Appli- ances for opening the mouth, and maintaining it in that position : e.g. a wooden wedge, a Mason’s gag, and a small dental mouth “prop”; (b) a pair of tongue forceps; (c) instruments for tracheotomy. Of the various restorative remedies, brandy, nitrite of amyl, tincture of digitalis, and liq. strychninse hydrochlor. are the most reliable.

By nitrous oxide free from air or oxygen.—The most convenient appai-atus is shown in Fig. 47. To ensure success, an accurately-working apparatus possessing wide channels, efficient valves, and a face-piece which exactly fits the patient’s face are

971 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SEOULDEIL to the arm -when thrown forwards, and away from tlie side ; or it may be pro- duced by a violent blow upon the front of the slioulder. Sir A. Cooper relates a case from the muscular spasms of epi- lepsy. The direction of the force would seem more potent in producing the tiislocation than muscular contraction. The head of the bone may rest any- where between the pos- tei'ior edge of the glenoid cavity and the infra- spinous region (Fig. 385). The capsule is torn below, and the subscapularis is Fig. 3S4.—Subclavicular Dislocation. (After Anger.) usually^mpletely ruptured. Special symptoms.—The elbow is advanced, and the arm (usually) rotajed inwards ; the arm is close to the side also. There may be slight lengthening. There is a marked hollow beneath the coracoid process, and a prominence under the spine of the scapula, formed by the large globular head of the humerus, which, being readily seen and felt, affords a characteristic sign of the displacement (Fig. 386). 5. Siipracoracoid dislocation of tlie liumcriis.—This very rare displacement may be shortly dismissed. It is caused by ^olence in an upward direction applied to the shoulder or elbow. The acromion or coracoid processes are usually fractured, or a longitudinal fracture separating the great tuberosity has also been disclosed on dissection. “The possibility of this form of dislocation without fracture is now definitely established by dissection ” (Hamilton). Partial dislocations of humerus. —The remarks on page 955 especially ^Pply here, and while the possibility of this accident is not to be positively denied, yet the majority of the recorded cases are obviously severe sprains associated with rupture or displace- ment of the biceps tendon, or of one or more of tlie short muscles, or of paralysis of muscles from injury to Fig. 385.—Subspinous Dislocation circumflex ncrve 01’ central cord of the Humerus. lesions.

FBACTOBES OF THE THIGH. 853 done if there have been any tendency to tilting forwards of the upper fragment. Elastic extension is easily arranged. When angular deformity is present, horizontal extension and repressive splints have a certain element of force about them. It is Fig. 300.â€”Treatment of a fractured Thigh by the double inclined Plane and Extension in the line of the Thigh. a common practice to raise the lower fragment into the line of the upper, and to maintain extension in this line. (5) The double inclined2:>lane for one or both limbs was the earliest form of apparatus having this object. The angle between the two planes can be varied as required. A frame such as that shown in Fig. 300 is easily and quickly made, the double inclined plane is that part on wiiich the limb rests; but the third leaf allows of variation in the position of the trunk. In some cases of fracture of the neck in the old and feeble it may be sufficient to use the sound limb as a splint and to fix the other to it at knee and ankle, with wool pads intervening; the usual firm band should be buckled round the trochanters. A better plan, and no more trouble, is to maintain extension as shown. The leg may be fixed to the lower plane and the angle be so arranged that the body-weight maintains slight extension. The principle of the double inclined plane is carried out in a far

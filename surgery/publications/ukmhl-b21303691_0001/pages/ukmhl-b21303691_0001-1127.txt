(See pages 954 and 1079.) The variety met with in the cases we are now considering is the “ dislocation by destruction," and we can hope for but little benefit from reduction even if it be still possible to effect it. For the flattened head would never rest upon the eroded acetabulum for long; there would be nothing to hold it there, and as long as it did lie in its old position it would be placed in an unsatisfactory condition as regards^ repair.

POPLITEAL ANEUBYSM. G59 Ti-catmcMt—Spontaneous cure may occur, and in some cases all that is required £ to place the patient at rest in bed, with the «■ n+orl limb raised and lightly bandaged, and to order a suitable die^t Should this simple treatment fail, and the tumour is small and firm, flexion should be tried, or Esmarch’s bandage may be or instrumental compression of the femoral artery has been sLcessful in a large number of cases ; if the aneurysm does not quickly consolidate under this treatment, it should not be prolonged for the reasons already given, but the artery should be tied. Liqature on the proximal side of the aneurysm is a very successfu operation; it maybe applied to the superficial femoral arteryat the apex of Scarpa’s triangle, or in Hunter’s canal, or to the poplite^ artery iust below the opening in the adductor magnus muscle. Of these situations, the one that has been most favoured by surgeons is the apex of Scarpa’s triangle, partly because the artery is more superficia and more readily accessible there, partly because it is far removed from the seat of disease, and the artery is probably healthy. Hut the "reat length of artery between the ligature and the aneurysm is really a disadvantage, for when the operation is successful, it causes cither a double obliteration of the main artery—at the seat of liga- ture and at the aneurysm—or the obliteration of the entire length of artery, and in either case it causes an unnecessary interference with the circulation in the thigh; also failure to cure the aneurysm —or so-called “recurrent pulsation ”—is frequent. For these rea- sons, and also because the artery close above an aneurysm is not so often diseased as to render its ligature perilous, ligature of the highest part of the popliteal artery has been recommended of late, and in practice this has been very successful. The operation is not difficult, with modern methods it is not dangerous, and in its effect upon the aneurysm it is more certain than ligature of the femoral vessel. Hunter, in his first three cases of ligature of the femoral artery for popliteal aneurysm, included the vein with the artery, but in his fourth case he tied the artery only, and since then surgeons have taken special pains not to wound or include the companion vein. Where the aneurysm is growing rapidly, and especially if with rapid enlargement there is a loss of clear outline and forcible pulsation, showing that the sac is leaking, the artery above should be tied without any delay, and without trial of any other method. If after ligature of the femoral artery pulsation recurs in the aneurysm, that is to say, if the operation has failed to cure the aneurysm, digital compression at the groin, with direct pressure over the tumour, is usually successful; if not, the surgeon must either tie the artery lower down, in Hunter’s canal or in the ham, or must excise the aneurysm. For secondary haemorrhage after the ligature the wound may be carefully plugged or, better, opened up, and the artery tied above and below the bleeding point, great care being taken not to rupture the

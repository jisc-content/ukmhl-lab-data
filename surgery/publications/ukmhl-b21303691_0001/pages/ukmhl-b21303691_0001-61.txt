Even the diphtheria bacillus, which, for the present, we may look upon as con- nected with a surgical disease, is not usually able to invade perfectly healthy fauces and tomsils; if, however, these parts become slightly inllamed, and there is slight exudation or ulceration at any point, the bacilli are enabled to gain a foothold ; they give rise to their special toxic products and acute inflammation accompanied by exudation of flbrinous lymph, rapid degeneration, and necrosis of the special tissues results. Then too, although the Bacillus diphtherise cannot exist either in the blood stream or in the lymph channels, except immediately airound the lesion, the poison secreted by the diphtheria bacillus is Tfalfsported to all parts of the body, and by its action may give rise to mark5d"degeneration of the peripheral nerves, and sometimes of the muscles supplied by them, thus setting up the characteristic peripheral liaralysis, whilst at the same time other organisms, taking advantage of the lowered vitality of the tissues and fluids at the seat of the disease, may take the opportunity of making their way by the various channels into the surrounding tissues, and even into distant organs. One of the best examples of a localised predisposition in medical diseases is the septic idcerative endocarditis, which results from the deposition of bacteria—Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus and Strepto- coccus pyogenes aureus—upon roughened or lacerated valves. The predisposition to osteomyelitis, when bones are fractured, before the Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus is injected into the blood system, has already been re fenced to. Another surgical example is found in an attack of bone tuberculosis, which almost invariably dates in the mind of the patient from a bruise or injury of the affected bone. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that everything which lowers the general condition of the i^atient, predisposes to infective surgical diseases—overcrowding, vitiated atmosphere, want of clean liness, bad hygienic conditions, including bad and insufficient food and exposure to extremes of hot and cold, want of sleep, imperfect or irregular evacuation of the excretions, excitement or emotion— an influence all important to the surgeon now that many of these factors have actually been found by experiments on animals to predispose to certain forms of disease. Haemorrhage, at one time so constantly associated with surgical operations, has been found to increase the susceptibility of animals to the attacks of the anthrax bacillus and of the micrococcus of osteomyelitis by the anaemia it t produces. GJycqsuria^has such a marked influence in predisposing to tubercular and purulent infection, that most surgeons dread to h.ave anything to do with diabetic patients. The same holds good in ca.ses of albumin^a, although local changes in the kidne;^ may, in part at anyrale, account for the special vulnerability of that organ. It would appear that in all these conditions there is some general factor at work, and Metchnikofl' maintains that the factor to be

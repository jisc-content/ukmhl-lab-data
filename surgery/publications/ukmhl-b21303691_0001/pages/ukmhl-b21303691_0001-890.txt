In most Jractures of the thigh we have to deal with longitudinal and rotatory displacement (shortening and eversion), and often with angular; there is often a tendency for the lower fragment to drop back and separate from the upper. Shortening is specially met by Fig. 29i.—A running Cradla for Extension. extension, the remaining deformity by the “ settmg " of the fracture, and by the application round it of splints, etc., to press the fragments into place, and prevent their displacement. Extension to be efficient should be constant—either elastic or by weight; the latter is generally the better. In all cases, friction should be reduced to a minimum, to diminish the drag upon the limb. As in some fractures it is desirable to raise the lower fragment to the

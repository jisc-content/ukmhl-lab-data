Each sui’geon must decide for himself whether and when he will undertake in recent cases an operation having such possibilities. It is a different matter in old cases of disabled limbs. Some attempt must be made to relieve by resecting the fibrous bond and bringing the fragments together after sufficiently free divi- sion of retaining tissues. But for septic failures, the results of these difficult opera- tions have been good. To avoid an open operation many in- genious plans have been suggested, of which the following are the best: Scrupulous cleanli- ness is as essential in them as in the open plan. A. E. Barker passes a narrow scalpel into the knee through the lig. patella;, and in withdrawing it cuts firmly on to the lower edge of the patella; a well-curved pedicle needle is introduced and pushed through the quadriceps tendon as 3io'.-Lister-s Method of 2 close to the patella wiring the Patella. Wires ^ as possible; the skin irghfV^K^BaSer.r''" over its point is drawn up a bit, the point is cut upon and a knife passed into the joint between the needle and the bone, laying the bone bare as it is withdrawn; the needle is threaded with wire or the strongest sterilised silk (Fig. 311) and withdrawn; the needle is now passed between the skin and patella from puncture to punc- ture, the upper end of silk threaded (Fig. 312) and with- drawn ; the two fragments are rubbed together till clot and soft tissues then the ends of fig. 811.—Barker’s Method of suturing the Patclln : the needle

251 AEIIOW WOUNDS. TIL ARROW WOUNDS. In several of the British expeditions on the Eastern frontier of India soldiers have incurred arrow wounds, such as was the case in the expedition against the Alcas and Abors. Hamilton points out the liability of these injuries to suppuration, profuse h^morrha e and tetanus. In many cases the arrows have been furnished with poisoned tips. The chief object in the treatment of arrow ^^nds is fhe removal of the missile without breaking off its head. Where it has penetrated beneath the skin, all that should be done on the field is to cut off the projecting part of the shaft and apply the first field- dressino'. At the hospital the subsequent extraction of the shaft and head must be carried out, with every care taken not to separate the head from the shaft in so doing. If the point of the arrow can be felt on the opposite side oi the Umb into which it has penetrated, the projection should be cut down upon, and the missile extracted on this aspect. Should the head and sLft be found separated, the latter can be withdrawn on one side and the former on the other. Should the arrow have penetrated a bone, Hamilton recommends it “ to be rocked to and fro in a direction at right angles with the plane of the groove which is made on the outer or feathered end of the shaft.” But this rocking is very likely to cause a separation of the head from the shaft. It would appear to be far preferable to »uide a probe-pointed bistoury along the shaft to the point at which the arrow has lodged in the bone, and then to freely incise the track, and attempt to withdraw the head with forceps. If this be im- possible, a wire should next be passed around the head of the arrow, and twisted round both the shaft and the forceps, and all three re- moved together. The arrow being removed, the track must be well syringed out and drained, and if a limb have been the point struck, it should be immobilised.

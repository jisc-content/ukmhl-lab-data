INJURIES OF BONES. 780 in an aseptic case, discharge has generally ceased, and dressings may then be left on for long periods. Results of antiseptic treatment of compound fracture.— Makins and Abbott have given a very valuable summary of the results obtained at St. Thomas’s Hospital in 322 compound fractures of the six long bones. The cases wei’e under the care of many different surgeons, house surgeons, and dressers during the years 1881-1890 ; the point common to all was the attempt to carry out treatment based on the antiseptic principle. Obviously, similar re- sults may be obtained by all who will take the necessary trouble. Of the 322 cases, 92 were of the upper (humerus, 54) limb, and 230 (tibia and fibula, 166) of the lower. Direct violence was the cause in 164, indirect in 107, whilst in 51 there was no cause stated. A joint was clearly implicated in 36 (9 per cent.), but the writers think this complication was more frequent. Of the 322, 12 (3-726 per cent.) died within 24 hours, 65 (20-18 per cent.) were treated by primary amputation, and 245 (76-08 per cent.) con- servatively. Of the 65 cases of primary amputation, 19 (29-23 per cent.) died—5 of 11 cases of fractured femur, 13 of 35 cases of fracture of both bones of the leg, 1 of 14 cases of fractured humerus. Most of the deaths were from shock and concurrent injury, but an amputa- tion at the hip died from slouglnng of the flaps, and two cases of leg amputation died of sepsis and pneumonia respectively. The high mortality, and the fact that only 3-7 per cent, died without opera- tion, show that amputation was done ^v^henever there was any hope of recovery. Of the 245 cases living over 24 hours and treated conservatively, 17 (5-27 per cent, of 322, 6-93 per cent, of 245) required secondary amputation. The indications were general septic infection, 2; tetanus, 1; cellulitis, 2; suppuration of soft parts, 6 ; and of neighbouring joint, 2 ; necrosis, 2 ; and secondary hiemorrhage, 2— failure to obtain or to maintain asepsis was the fundamental cause in all cases. Of the 17 cases 3 died (17-65 per cent.). Thei’6 remained 228 cases (70*80 per cent, of tlie wliole), which were treated conservatively throughout; of these 7 (or 2-86 per cent.) died. If two deaths from broncho-pneumonia—not septic— and ordinary pharyngeal diphtheria be sulitracted, the mortality is reduced to "2-04 per cent. One death was from tetanus, and the four others from ordinary sepsis. When it is remembered that in pre-antiseptic days a large number of these conservatively-treated cases would have been subjected to primary amputation, that the mortality among those treated conservatively would have varied m different institutions between 25 per cent, and 70 per cent., and that a considerable number of those recovering would have Mst the injured limb by secondary amputation, the above results show clearly the improvement effected by antiseptics. Of every 100 cases thought fit for conservation, treated a.s they were at St. ihoraass Hospital, 3-26 per cent, would die, and 5-71 per cent, would recover

Some large odon- tomes from the antrum have been described as exostoses, but careful histological examination shows that they are composed of dentine, cementum, and enamel (Fig. 369). To the present time upwards of thirty com- posite odontomes are known; of these two- thirds were situated in the mandible, and the remainder occupied the maxillae. The largest specimens were from the upper jaws, and in some of them the clinical facts were very exti’aordinary. Composite odontomes resemble teeth, in that for a time during their development they I’emain hidden below the gum; in due course they enter on an eruptive stage, when the suppuration, and constitu- tional disturb- ance dependent thereon, draw at- tention to them (Fig. 370). In some cases the eruption of an odontome has placed life in jeopardy. Most cases of odontomes, when they come under observation, are usually regarded When a young Fig. 369.—Large Composite Odontome from the Antrum, size. (T. Duka.)

Tumours of the antrum.—These in- clude the following genera :—Myxoma, sarco- mata, and epithelioma. In addition, the antrum is extremely liable to be invaded by tumours, originating in the orbit, nasal fossa, naso- pharynx, gums, and teeth.

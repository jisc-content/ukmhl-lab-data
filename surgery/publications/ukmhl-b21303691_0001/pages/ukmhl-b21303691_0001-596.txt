INJURIES OF BLOOD-VESSELS 552 and wounds of the plantar arch are to be treated in the same way as wounds of the palmar arch. In cases of secondary luemorrhage from wounds of the femoral or ]3opliteal artery, the wound must be opened up, and the vessel re- ligatured above and below the bleeding point. ’When the liEemo- rrhage is threatening, it may be prevented by digital or other compression of the main artery higher up, or by careful aseptic plugging of the wound. If the bleeding recurs after a second liga- ture of the vessel, amputation at the level of the wound in the artery is the only resource, as ligature of the artery at a higher level exposes the patient to the gravest risk of gangrene. Wounds of the femoral vein are very grave injuries. A small wound should be closed by a lateral ligature of the vessel, a large wound by a double circular ligature ; the companion artery should not be ligated unless Avounded. If the heart and vessels are healthy, the popliteal or the femoral artery and vein may be simultaneously ligatured without the occurrence of gangrene. Rupture of a varicose vein of the leg—or its wound—may be easily con- trolled by the pressure of a pad, fixed on by a bandage extending up from the roots of the toes.

716 DrSEASES OF THE SKfH. ntevoid structure, are one of the most characteristic features of lupus erythematosus. In common lupus a pinkish semi-translucent appearance may be present in the nodules, <and has given rise to the comparison to “ apple-jelly.” 5. With the greater tendency of common lupus to ulcerate must be associated the occurrence of crusts or scaV)s, and sometimes of considerable pus formation. . 6. Lupus vulgaris may attack mucous membranes, especially those of the lips, nose, palate, and eyelids. It may be noted finally that both common lupus and lupus erythematosus are mainly diseases of temperate or cold climates, being rare for instance in Australia, and the cases are nearly always benefited by removal to warm and equable climates. Stases of lupus.—The following stages of lupus vulgaris may be enumerated. . . i There is first a nodule of cell-infiltration of a pink or brov m^h- red colour ; this spreads at its edge, fresh spots are formed in the vicinity, and they may persist in this form for many months or even years. As a rule, before long a pustule develops at the centre of the nodule, it bursts, and a small ulceration increases both at the edge and to a less extent m dep^, and may occasionally cicatrise spontaneously ; this, however, is lare, and even should it occur at one point the disease is probably con- tinuing to spread at the edge. The scars left by common lu^us, whether the result of treatment or not, are often coarse and ^ic , Tnd prone to break down again : in other words, it is very difficult tothoroughly eradicate all the cell-infiltration, which is the essence ^A wi’5^ common site for lupus to begin is f P"* and from^ here it tends to invade the skin m “on o^^^^ lirapr blood supply, i.e. towards the neck.

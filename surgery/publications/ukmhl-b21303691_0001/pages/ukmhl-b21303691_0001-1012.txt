970 DISLOCATIONS. Fig. 382.—Luxatio Ereeta to be produced by a fall, the patient clutching something in his descent. In one of Hulke’s in- teresting cases of this dislocation, a baker fell through a trap- door, and seized a ladder to save him- self. He was con- strained after the dis- location to keep his hand near the top of his head (Fig. 382). Owing to the interval which had elapsed complete reduction could not be effected, but the arm was brought down to the side. 3. Suljclavicular dis- location of the linmeiTis. Anatomy. — This dislocation may be looked upon as pri- marily subcoracoid, but the m^uscles7 and perhaps the di- rection of the force, cause tlie head of the bone to pas^ under the clavicle to the inner side of the coracoid process (Fig." 384). Here it lies on the upper ribs beneath the pectoral muscle, forming a manifest prominence. The capsule is torn inferiorly and ..anteriorly; and the muscles attache.d to the great tuberosity must be torn, or that process separated from the shaft. Special symptoms. — The arm is shortened, and the elbow thrown back- wards and .(usually) markedly out- wards. The head of the bone can be felt and seen below the clavicle ; and on deep axillary palpation the shaft of the bone can be felt crossing the cavity upwards and inwards to the displaced head (Fig. 383). 4. Subspinous dislocation ol llic liuiuci’iis.—In this exceptional dislocation the violence must be applied

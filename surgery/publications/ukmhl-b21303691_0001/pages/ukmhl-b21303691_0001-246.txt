X. WOUNDS AND CONTUSIONS. By W. WATSON CHEYNE, F.E.S., F.R.C.S., Suryeon to King’s College Hospital; Professor of Surgery at King’s College, THE HEALING OF WOUNDS. There are various ways in wliich wounds may heal, namely— 1. Healing by first intention; 2. By granulation; 3. By union of granulations; 4. By blood clot; 5. By scabbing. 1. Healing by first intention.—The simplest and, therefore, the first method to be considered, is healing by first intention. AVhen a wound is inflicted, the knife, in passing through the tissue, sets up the early stages of inflammation in a microscopic layer of the living tissue in the immediate vicinity. This in- flammation, as can be readily seen in a frog’s foot, does not extend more than a line or two beyond the cut surface, but the extent will vary according to the degree to which the tissues have been injured by manipulation, sponging, etc. The inflanunation so set up goes on to the first stage, namely, in the first instance there is dilatation of the blood-vessels and an increased flow of blood, followed by slowing, and ultimately stasis; while at the same time exudation of liquor sanguinis and blood corpuscles takes place from the inflamed vessels, and thus the surface of the wound becomes in a few hours glazed over with exuded material—what is termed lymph. {See page 59.) If at the time of the operation all foreign material,-such as blood clot, etc., be removed from between the cut surfaces, and they be placed in accurate apposition, this lymph will glue them together. If no further causes of inflammation come into play, the inflammatory process ceases at the point of exudation, and healing changes commence. In a very short time, this lymph which glues together the cut surfaces becomes infiltrated with large numbers of cells, in part leucocytes which have emigrated from the blood-vessels, and in part also lai’ger plasma cells which are derivatives of the fi.xed connective

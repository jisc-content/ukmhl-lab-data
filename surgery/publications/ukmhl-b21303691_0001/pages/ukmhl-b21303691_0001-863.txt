FRACTUBES OF THE HUMERUS. 821 much swelling when the patient is seen that effective examination is impossible; the limb should then be laid on a pillow and ice or pres- sure used to check swelling. As soon as ]jossible a careful e.xamina- tion is made, and any displacement reduced. Where no diagnosis can be made, the successful treatment of the fracture depends upon the adoption of that position which is most likely to bring the fragments into their normal relation. In all these injuries there is a difference of opinion as to Avhether the limb should be put Figs. 256 and 257.—Cubituin Valgum and Varum after Injuries to the Elbow Joint. lathe former the carrying angle is increased; in the latter it is reversed. (Prom a paper by Mr. Nunn in the Clinical Society’s Transactions, 1892.) up straight or more or less flexed. In favour of the straight position it is said that it is impossible otherwise so to set the fracture as to maintain the natural angle (“cari’ying angle”) of about 170° outwards between the humerus and ulna—cubitum valgum and varum (Figs. 256, 257), corresponding to genu valgum and varum, being the result. This being regarded as a tesf-point of perfect reduction, it is held that stiffness is more likely to result from the flexed position. Those who use the flexed position—and they in- clude the great majority—deny this, and quote good results. They speak of stiffness resulting frequently from the straight position— much more disastrous result than a stiff elbow at 90°—and of the discomfort of the constantly hanging limb to the patient. It may

The first trial, made upon Meister on JuTy 5th 1886, confirmed this anticipation, and since then, in the yeara 1886-1891 inclusiye, 9,461 persons bitten by ostensibly mac Lcrs haye been treated at the Pasteur Institute in Pans on the same lines. Of this number, only ninety died ; and thus a death rate of 0'95 per cent, is substituted for that of at least 14 per cent ofcun^Vin persons bitten by rabid dogs not subjected to preyentiye ivZment During the years 1886 to 1893 inclusive, 14,430 persons undenvent the treatment, of whom 72 died, a death-rate of 0-50 per cent This is strong eyidence in fayour of the method, which moreoyer, has been reported upon fayourably by a Goyernment Committee, after repetition of the experiments by Horsley. Material for injection is prepared at tlie Pasteur Institute, as follows :-The spinal cord is obtained from rabbits rendered rabid by inoculation with virus, previously passed through a succession of animals of the same race to heighten its intensity. _ The nervous tissue is cut into small blocks, and desiccated for various periods by suspension over a smaU fragment of caustic potash m a sterdised flask at a temperature of 72° F. Portions of the recimpd degree of modification are mashed up in a mortar, with _ slightly alkaline sterilised broth, to a state of fine emulsion, and this is employed in doses of from 1 to 3 cc., the larger quantity bemg used in the case of the more highly modified material. ... The quantity of dry nervous tissue in each injection amounts to about 1 centigramme, and inequality in the strength of the material thus prepared is made up for by repetition of injections of the same reputed strength during the course of treatment. Two formulEe are employed:—(a) “The simple,” for ordinary bites of the limbs not numerous ; (b) “ The intensive,” for wounds of the head or face, severe multiple wounds, and the bites of cats oi wolves. Variations are made between the two formulte to meet the severity of individual cases. A. SIMPLE.

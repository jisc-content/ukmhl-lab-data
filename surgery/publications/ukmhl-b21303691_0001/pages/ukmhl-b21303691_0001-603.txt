Tuberculous arteritis.—The arteries in tissues the seat of tubercular lesions show a change very similar to that in syphilis. The intima is enormously thickened by a fine cell growth, and the other coats are usually the seat of inflammatory change; but the essential and most constant and marked change is the thickening of the intima, which is caused by the tubercle bacilli finding their way into the vessel-wall. The lumen of the vessel may be reduced to a fine slit only, or be wholly obliterated by the growth of the intima. 7. Obliterating' arteritis.—This name has been applied to a rare disease, occurring independently of syphilis, tubercle, gout, rheumatism, or other constitutional malady, and independently also of embolism or injury. The cause is unknown ; it is most often seen in persons of middle age, but the writer has met with the disease in an otherwise healthy man of nineteen years of age and in a woman of twenty-seven. The disease is believed to commence in the small arteries, and thence to extend into the larger vessels. It is characterised by a great proliferation of the endothelium, which gradually narrows the vessel, until it occludes it; sometimes thrombosis occurs to complete the occlusion. The new tissue—and

The next layer ■ consists of unossified bone tissue (c), in places A intemaixed with small areas of cartilage cells, which have undergone premature calcification (d). Beyond this are islets of fully-developed bone, still surrounded by bone tissue, as yet uncal- cified, enclosing abnor- mally large and vascular medullary spaces (e). Chemical examina- tions of the bone in rickets have shown it to be very deficient in lime salts, the proportion to the organic constituents being reduced in marked cases to as much as -i- in place of the normal -|. c The liver and spleen are occasionally much enlarged, and a less marked change is ob served in the kidneys- and lymphatic glands. The enlargement de- pends mainly on an in- D crease of the fibroid ele- ments, with some over- growth of the glandular E tissue (Dickinson). The voluntary muscles are pale and fiabby, in the heart fatty degenera- tion has been noted, and the blood is deficient in red discs. The tendency of the disease is towards spon- taneous cure; this is effected by obliteration Fig. 72.—Section of an Epiphysis in Biokets. of the abnormally larffe (Modified from Ziegler.)

(Museum, Middlesex Hospital.) pedunculated myoma. Calcification is a common change, the calcareous matter is not deposited ii'regularly, but follows the peculiar whorls of the muscle tissue (Fig. 111). , . , , . , j It occasionaUy happens that a myoma, which has e^sted many years and given rise to little inconvemence, suddenly enlarges, ^rows rapidly, assumes formidable proportions, and gives rise o constitutional disturbance. These changes are analogous to those which occur when a submucous myoma extrudes from the cervix and becomes gangrenous, that is, they are due to septic infection. Tlie occurrence of these changes leads to the infiltration ot the tumour with leucocytes and round cells ; thus sections prepared from it resemble those from a round-celled sarcoma, and there can be little doubt that in many specimens described as “ sarcornatous de- generation of uterine myomata,” the changes in and the rapid growth of the tumours were the result of septic infection. The clinical characters of uterine myomata are discussed in the section devoted to the Diseases of the Female Genital Organs (Art. LIII.Yol. IT.).

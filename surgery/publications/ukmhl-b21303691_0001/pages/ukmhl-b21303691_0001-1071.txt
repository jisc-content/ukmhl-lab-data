1029 DISLOCATIONS OF TEE TARSUS. wliich are free and unimpeded. The rest of the foot is displaced from its connection with these two bones. The displacements may be lateral or antero-posterior, and the diagnosis is made by obseiwing the clubbed appearance of the foot, the projections of the displaced bones, and the position of the lesion. Reduction is to be effected by flexion of the leg, and extension of the front of the foot, with rotatory movements. Displacements of individual tarsal bones or of the metatarsus or phalanges. — Dislocation of the os calcis alone is a rare accident, fracture being far more common.

Any of the other tarsal bones may be completely or partially displaced by crushes or wrenches. The displacement is generally dorsal. Fracture is likewise found, and the displacements are often com- pound. The symptoms are plain from the position and rela- tions of the displaced bone. In compound injuries, and if reduc- tion be impossible in complete dislocations, resection should be practised. Any of the metatarsal bones, collectively or singly, may be dis- placed from the tarsus forwards, backwards, or laterally. The ^ortening and projections will indicate the nature of the injury The internal cuneiform, with the metatarsal bones, may be dis- located (R. Smith).

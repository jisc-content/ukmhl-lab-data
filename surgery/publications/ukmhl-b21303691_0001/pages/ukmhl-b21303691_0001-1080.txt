DISEASES OF JOINTS. 1038 hyperemia and the fluid accumulation differ in few respects from what is observed in the subacute form of the disease, the per- sistence of the congestion of the synovial membrane for long periods leads to its plastic thickening. It thus becomes altered in consistence, being voluminous and often irregularly hypertrophied in all its parts. When its borders are particularly affected, pendulous masses or folds are often formed within it, which hang loose about the sides of the joint (Fig. 430). These may give rise to considerable modification of the movements of the articulation, and may cause a sense of weakness in the latter, or, if the pedicle of such a pendulous mass be torn through during movement, a loose body is produced, with many serious consequences. The ligamentous structures of the joint are often affected at the same time in various ways, to be alluded to presently. The sysiuptoms of simple chronic synovitis have much in common with those of the subacute variety, and it would not be necessary to consider the two forms apart were it not for the fact that the plastic changes produced in chronic inflanamation of the synovial membrane seriously interfere in many cases with the functions of the joint if neglected. , . , . ■ u The treatment, too, up to a certain point, is the same m botn affections. But in addition, we have to endeavour to help in the absorption of the plastic matter, or actually to remove it. In the first instance we make use of strapping, with friction combined, with painting of iodine over the part, or inunction of mercurial ointment. Rest during this treatment is desirable, and later, cautious passive movement. But for a long time after the patient is able to get about it is well to keep the part enveloped in an elastic bandage, so as to prevent that passive congestion and swelling which is so apt to reappear on resumption ot active r\TT m P T1 ■fr tonics, and sea-bathing if possible.

489 iMPLANTATION 0Y8TS. These tumours may lie in depressions in the bones and project the scalp and be mistaken for sebaceous tumours, or even meningoceles if they "row, as they are ant to do, over a fontanelle and receive pulsation from the brain. Exceptionally, they project on the cere- bral aspect of the dura mater, and lead to fatal compression of the brain. Dermoids of this kind have several times been observed in relation with the tentorium cerebelli. Iinplantatioii cysts. — It is a recognised fact that der- moids do not occur in the limbs, but certain small tumours are occasionally observed in the hands and fingers, which have been described as dermal cysts, sebaceous cysts, or digital der- moids. In structure these tumours present a central cavity containing epithelial debris and a lining of skin; indeed, when examined microscopically, they appear “ as if a piece of skin had been inverted into the subcu- taneous tissue ” (Shattock). These tumours are known as “ im- plantation cysts, ” as there is every reason to believe that tliey are produced by small pieces of skin ac- cidentally trans- planted by in- jury, especially pricks by sharp instruments, such as awls, needles, forks, etc. They also occur in cicatrices. Implantation cysts are usually of the size of cherry- stones, but they may reach the size of bantam’s eggs. These tumoui’s are not confined to the limbs; they have been observed on the trunk, scalp, and face. Very many examples have been reported in the cornea and iris, the results of punc- tured wounds, injuries and operations on the eyeball.

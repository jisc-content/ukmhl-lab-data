678 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF LYMPHATIGS. germinate in the sinuses, and the stroma of the tumour is developed from the lymphadenoid tissue. {See pages 480 and 485.) Congenital defects of the lymphatics.—Certain congenital defects of the lymphatics give rise to tumours which, though not noticed at birth, make their appearance soon after. Fore- most amongst these is coiiirciiital cystic liyg:i’oiiin, which occurs most frequently in the neck (hydrocele of the neck), in the axilla, on the back, and occasionally in the region of the kidney. It is very rarely, but sometimes, seen in the limbs. It consists of an aggregation of numerous cysts, •which spring, in the neck, from beneath the deep cervical fascia, and presents on either side of the sterno-mastoid at any point between the clavicle and the mastoid pro- cess. {See Art. XLIII., on In- juries AND Dis- eases OF THE Neck, Vol. II.) When occurring beneath the lower jaw, they consti- tute a form of ranula. (See Art. XLV., on Af- fections OF THE Mouth, Palate, Tongue, and Ton- sil, Vol. II.) (The connection of these cysts with the branchial clefts is alluded to on page 490.) In size the cysts vary from that of a pea to that of an orange, or even larger, and their increase is capriciou.s, the whole mass often attaining veiy large proportions. They distend the superficial skin so that their shape, and even contents, may be seen on the surface. Prolongations often extend down into the thorax, and any increase in this direction may produce fatal effects from pres- sure. On dissection they are found to be composed of innumerable cysts, formed by the dilatation of lymph spaces, with walls formed by areolar tissue, and lined by a single layer of endothelial cells. The size and contents of the component cysts vary greatly both as to Fig-. 192.—Congenital Dilatation of the Xymphatics of the "Tongue. Lymphangeioma cavernosvim.

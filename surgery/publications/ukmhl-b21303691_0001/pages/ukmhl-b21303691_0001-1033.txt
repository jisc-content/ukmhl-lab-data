991 DISLOCATIONS OF THE THUMB. are to be treated by dn-ect extension under antesthetics. If inseparable difficulties be found in their reduction, an antiseptic incision should be made, re- sisting structures divided, and the bones replaced. If compound, the articular ends may need resection. Dis- location of the first phalanx from the metacarpal bone of the thumb requires special mention, on account of the difiiculty described as met with in reduction. I have found as much difiiculty in reduction of dislocations of the first phalanx in some of the other digits, as in the case of the thumb. Dislocations of the metacarpo - phalangeal joint of the thumb.—In the large majority of cases, fche^phalar^ is displaced backwards, and the head of Fig. 399.—Dislocation of the first Phalanx of the Thumb backwards. (After Anger.) tne "T" ^Qtacarpai bone bursts through the glenoid, ligament, between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis, containing the sesamoid bones which embrace its neck (Digs. 399, 400). The prominence of the head of the metacarpal bone may be felt anteriorly, and the base of the displaced phalanx dorsally. The phalanx is flexed dorsally, forming an obtuse angle with the metacarpal bone The obstacles to reduction are said to be the constric- tion of the neck of the metacarpal bone by the short flexor tendons; but I am inclined to believe that torn and twisted portions of the glenoid ligament inter- vening, and being wrapped round the neck of the bone, are potent causes of tlie undoubted difficulty found in the treat- ment of this displacement. To relax the ligaments and the short flexor tendons as much as possible, the metacarpal bone should be strongly ad- 1 i phalanx pushed forwards with the phaiSlfllmuld''bp r metacarpal region. The displaced phalanx should be strongly drawn at first in the direction of the Fig. 400.—Appearance in Dors.U Dislocation of the first Phalanx of the Thumb. ducted, and the base of

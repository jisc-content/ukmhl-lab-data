POTT’S FRAOTUBE. 869 into which the astragalus, outer edge first, can ascend {Dupuytren’s fracture). The foot is greatly everted, but the chief feature is the increase in width at the level of the malleoli. {See also page^lOlS.) (4) In catching the heel, alighting from a height or from a carriage in motion, the leg-bones tend to move on after the foot has been arrested, and a dislocation backwards of the foot is likely to occur ; sometimes the astragalus and os calcis carry both malleoli with them (Fig. 330); the heel projects markedly ; the lower end of. the tibia forms a prominence in front; the tendo AchiUis is stretched, Figs. 327 and 328.—Views, from the inner and outer Sides, of the Bones from an old case of Pott's Fracture. The internal malleolus has been broken and carried backwards ; so has tlie external malleolus, the fibula having yielded one inch up. The astragalus has been dis- placed backwards, and the foot bones have rotated outwards beneath it, flattening the arch. A chronic inflammation has obliterated the ankle and some other joints. (Charing Cross Museum, No. 416.) and the astragalus is depressed below the often fractured posterior edge of the tibial surface, hence the toes are pointed downwards. The displaced malleoli can be felt. The lower epiphysis of the tihia ossifies in the second year and joins at 18 or 19. Separation of it with fracture of the fibula, or, very exceptionally, with separation of the lower epiphysis of the fibula, almost replaces Pott’s fracture in the young, and is caused by similar violence. The epiphysis and foot are generally dislocated backwards or back and out, while the diaphysis tends to protrude, or protrudes in front. Reduction has not as a rule been difficult; and in compound cases the result has been good. Bryant thinks that sprains in the young may often involve loosening of this epiphysis and that getting about too early on the foot may result in inflamma- tion, impaired growth, and shortening of the limb

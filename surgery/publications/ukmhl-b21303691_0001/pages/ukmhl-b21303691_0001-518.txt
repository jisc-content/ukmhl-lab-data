4,74 TUMOURS. large spurious cyst forms in the sarcoma, and on cutting into it the fluid escapes with large, irregular pieces of the tumour, which are generally of a greyish-white colour. When necrosis occurs exten- sively in a large sarcoma it will sometimes check its course in a very marked manner. The distribution of sarcomata.—As connective tissue occurs in every organ of the body, so sarcomata are ubiquitous. But they grow in some situations much more frequentl}’^ than in others. Some species arise in any organ, others are restricted to certain definite structm’es. Sarcomata frequently arise in subcutaneous tissue and Fig. 119.—Adrenal Tumour, with the Kidney in situ, (Museum, Royal College of Surgeons.) fascia, intermuscular septa, periosteum, marrow of bone, testis, ovary, and salivary glands ) occasionally they occur in the brain, rarely in the spinal cord and nerves, They are very rare as primaiy tumours of muscles, liver, lung, spleen, alimentary canal or uterus. Sarcomata grow from the retina of children and uveal tract of adults, and in connection with congenital defects of the skin. The clinical characters of sarcomata are considered in the Articles devoted to special organs. _ i • i • i Adrenal tumours.—Tumours exhibiting the histological characters of the zona fasciculata arise in the adrenals and in accessory adrenals. An adrenal may become transformed into a large tumour in the same way that the thyroid gland becomes a goitre, and some- times the mass produced by this change may equal a melon in size (Fif^. 119). In children both adrenals may be aflbeted. 'Accessory adrenals are occasionally found embedded in the

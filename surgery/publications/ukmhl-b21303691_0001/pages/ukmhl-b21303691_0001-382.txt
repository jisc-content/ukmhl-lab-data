8UEGICAL DISEASES DUE TO PARASITES. 338 in very many instances some of the cliaracteristics of the actinomyces- wliile they describe the black particles as a curious metamorpliosis of a large branching septate fungus. They suggest, therefore, that the two varieties are distinct, but consider both fungi pathogenic. The division of the disease into two forms has oidginated solely from the diflerent appearance of the contents of the abscess cavities; otherwise, the pathological process is practically identical in each. Mode of infection.—Probably the development of the disease is always preceded by a slight injury or abrasion, but owing to the chronic course of the disease, this is often missed in the history. Morbid anatomy. — The disease may be limited to the connective tissue planes, but in old cases more commonly invades all the Pig. 61.—Sagittal Section of a Foot aifeoted with Mycetoma. (St. Thomas's Hospital Museum.) tissues of the limb, inducing the formation of abundant granulation tissue, numerous abscess cavities, and fistulse. The abscess cavities, lined with firm cicatricial tissue, may be isolated, or intercommu- nicate freely by tortuous fistulte, which reach the surface. They contain either a dark granular substance, much resembling coarse gunpowder (black variety), or small aggregated particles resembling fish-roe (pale or ochroid variety). The fatty tissue of the limb is especially prone to invasion, the muscles less so. The short bones are usually the most niarkedly afiected: they are softened and excavated, the cancellar walls are atrophied and opened out and the spaces filled with a greasy pulp; or smooth connective-tissue-lined cavities, identical with those seen in the soft tissues, may be deve- loped. More rarely the affection extends to the long bones. Symptoms,—The early development of the process is very slow. A small localised induration often between the toes, or upon some part of the dorsum or sole of the foot, is the first sign; the skin

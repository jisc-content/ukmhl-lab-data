The ' in colour from grey to vellow appears to depend on the age of the m’cranism, the older ones gaining the characteristic yellow colou it°is these in which club formation is most marked. When fiist still clothed in a layer of round cells; but treat- ment with a few drops of weak caustic potash allows the following structure to be made out microscopically. Pressure of the cover- crlass causes the primary nodule to break up into smaller ones, each apparently consisting of a series of club-like processes, radiating Ime Ssades from a centre (Fig. 55). These processes are the so-called clubs re<^arded by Bostrom and many observers as a degeneration of the terminal filaments of the fungus. The ultimate structure is only to be made out in prepared sections of tissue. When so exa- mined, each centre consists of an intricate mass of filaments, develop- ing spores, and arranged in the form of a hollow capsule deficient at one spot, from which filaments pass from the interior into the sur- rounding tissue, forming a kind of root. The centre of the sphere consists of irregularly-arranged filaments branching dichotomously, the branches equalling the parent filaments in size. When they reach the periphery the dichotomous division becomes extremely free, and a highly intricate network is formed, in the meshes of which abun- dant round or oval spores are entangled. Beyond this bounding network, called by Bostrom the mantle or germ stratum (Keimlager), a series of slender radiating filaments project, at first branching little, and then abundantly, and beyond these the clubs are arranged, often more or less cast oS" from the central portion of the organism. Each club consists of a central filament enveloped in a laminated gelati- nous sheath, pyriform in outline, or sometimes ending in finger-like

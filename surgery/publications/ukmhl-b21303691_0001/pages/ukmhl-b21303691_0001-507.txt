(After Virchow.) Muscle tumours may arise in, and remain confined to, any ^ one of these layers ; or they may arise in all three in the same individual. Submucous and subserous myomata rarely attain a large size, they quickly become pedunculated and project into the peritoneal cavity in the case of the subserous variety, and into the uterine cavity when originating in the submucous tissue. It must also be borne in mind that intramural myomata not infrequently project into the uterine or peritoneal cavities, acquire stalks, and simulate those which arise in the submucous and subserous layers. When intra- mural myomata become pedunculated and project, eitlier on the serous or mucous aspect of the uterus, they attain larger proportions than those which arise in the subserous or submucous strata.

It is true that a caseous degeneration has been noticed in certain syphilitic new formations and in some other isolated conditions, but the instances are all exceptional. The process is one of necrosis and fatty degeneration. The caseous patch is a sequestrum; an area of absolutely dead tissue, which is capable of no other than chemical changes (Fig. 67).

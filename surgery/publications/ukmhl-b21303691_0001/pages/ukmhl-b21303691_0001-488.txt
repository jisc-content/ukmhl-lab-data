TUMOURS. growth of the individual; and (5) only imperil life from mechaiiical causes, and especially when they grow in the vicinity of vital organs. The connective tissue group contains one genus of malignant tumour—the sarcomata; and the epi- thelial group contains two genera— epitheliomata and carcinomata. The re- maining groups—dermoids and cysts— contain only innocent tumours. As the terms innocency and malig- nancy are in frequent use, it will be necessary to illustrate them by some concrete examples. It is necessary to mention at the outset that innocent tumours sometimes destroy life as cer- tainly and as quickly as malignant tumours. The essential difference be- tween them may be expressed thus: The baneful results of simple tumours entirely depend on their environment ; hut malignant tumours destroy life, whatever their situation. Of all the simple tumours few can claim to be more innocent than the fibrous tumours of nerve-sheaths termed neuromata. When they grow on the peripheral nerves, even the largest trunks, they may be said never to cause death, although they are very often the source of intolerable pain and anguish. When a neuroma springs from the roots of the upper spinal nerves, it will cause no trouble, so long as it can be accommodated between the wmlls of the spinal canal and the cord ; but as soon as it begins to encroach upon and compress the soft cord against the resisting bony walls of the spinal canal symptoms of paraplegia supervene, and ewntually death. This is well demonstrated in the specimen (Fig. 94), taken from a man 45 years of age. The anterior crural nerve is occupied by a neuroma the size of an orange. Its existence was accidentally discovered after death. Many of the roots of the lumbar nerve contain small neuromata. Some are so closely congregated as to

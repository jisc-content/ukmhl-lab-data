XXII. TUMOUES. By bland SUTTON, F.R.C.S., Assistant Surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital- The significance of the term tumours has in recent years been very greatly curtailed, partly on account of increased knowledge in regard to their histology and the relation of micro-organisms to some forms of morbid growths (“tumour diseases” of J. Muller), and partly on account of a more accurate knowledge of embryology. The morbid conditions usually classed among tumours will be, in this Article, further curtailed by the exclusion of those diseases termed by Virchow “ infective granulomata,” which include tubercle, glanders, actinomycosis, and the gummatous lesions of syphilis. This list will continue to expand as our knowledge of micro-organisms in- creases. In spite of this restricted meaning the term tumour still remains indefinable. Classification.—Tumours may be readily arranged in four groups:— I. Connective Tissue Tumoues. II. Epithelial Tumoues. III. Deemoids. lY. Cysts. Each gi’oup contains a number of genera, and each genus comprises one or more species. A list of the genera will precede the description of each group. Innocency and malignancy.—Before proceeding to the sys- tematic description of tumours it is necessary to take into considera- tion certain peculiarities relating to them. For instance, surgeons recognise in the connective tissue and in the epithelial tumours two very important clinical features—innocency and malignancy. Malignant tuniours exhibit the following characters:—(1) infiltration, (2) infection of lymph glands, (3) recurrence after removal, (4) dissemination, (5) inevitable destruction of life. Innocent tnmonrs, on the other hand, are (1) usually en- capsuled, and when diffuse do not infiltrate. (2) They do not infect the glands. (3) They do not recur after removal; or (4) dissemi- nate, but tend continually to increase in size independently of the

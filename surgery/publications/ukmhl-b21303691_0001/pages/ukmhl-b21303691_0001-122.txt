/ 78 INFLAMMATION. value ill cases where there are adhesions, especially among tendons ind muscles. The muscle is grasped with the spread-out fingers, squeezed, and kneaded, the action always commencing at the distal' part of the muscle and gradually passing towards the upper end, and being carried out with both hands at the same time; subsequently to the kneading, effleurage is employed in order to drive the broken-up material into the lymphatics. The fourth method is used where the particles are still more difficult to break up, and in it the chickened tissues are tapped with the fingers, in the first instance lightly, and afterwards more forcibly, this attempt to break them up being followed by kneading and effleurage.

In most cases the patient ought to be supplied with suitable nourishing food, plenty of fresh am, and exercise as far as is consistent with the requisite rest of the part.

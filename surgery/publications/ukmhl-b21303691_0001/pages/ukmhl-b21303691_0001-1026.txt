DISLOCATIONS. 984 (3) If crepitus exists; and if in any displacement the condyles move with the bones of the fore-arm. (4) If the liead of the radius rolls in its normal position to the external condyle. Tliese questions can usually only be satisfactorily answered with the aid of ansesthetics. Treatment of dislocations of the elbow, backwards and lalerallj^—In recent cases of backward or lateral dislocation, extension of the . fore-arm, wTEIi counter-extension of ITie Eumerus wiTl^ especially under ansesthesia, easily bring about reduction. In the lateral disloca- tions, the direc- tion of the ex- tension must be appropr i a t ely modified, and di- rect pressure made upon the project- inar olecranon or O radius. Perhaps there is no better plan of reducing dislo- cations of the elbow backwards than by the knee method. The pa- tient being seated. Fig. 394. -Reduction of Disloctition of tlie Elbow baclcwards. Or reclimng if anaesthetised, the surc^eon places his foot on the edge of the chair, and presses with his knee against the humerus, drawing upon the wrist at the same time with one hand, so as to _£lex ^eJoint rou.nd his, knee, and pushing the humerus backwards wiCli tlie other (Fig. 394). If these dislocations have been overlooked for five weeks, re- duction will probably be found impossible, the interlocked promi- nences of bone being soon welded firmly together by fibrous adhesions. Violent efforts, as with pulleys, are strongly to be condemned, and the too free “breaking-up” of adhesions may be followed by very serious inflammatory consequences, or associated witli fracture of the bones. Subcutaneous division of the triceps and of adhesions has been had recourse to in these cases ; but supposing the joint to be fixed in a faulty position, and the patient to be young.

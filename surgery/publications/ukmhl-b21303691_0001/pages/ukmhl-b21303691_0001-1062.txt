DISLOG JiTIONS. 1020 ends of tlie tibia and fibnla. Sliould the malleoli and lower end of the tibia move with the displaced foot, the case will be one of fracture or displacement forwards of the lower epiphyses of the tibia and fibula. This latter accident has been confounded with true dislocation, which at sight it much resembles. Dislocation of tlie ankle upwards.—It has been pointed out that one variety of dislocation upwards is that described as Dupuytren^s fracture, namely, when a complete outward hori- zontal displacement of the foot and lower end of a broken fibula are drawn upwards by the leg muscles. Occasionally it happens, however, that the strong ligaments uniting the tibia and fibula are ruptured, and the astragalus and foot pass directly upwards.

As mi"ht be expected, the enormous strength of these ligaments renders this an excessively rare accident. Fracture of the malleoli may complicate it. Should the reader meet with an instance of disloca- tion of the astragalus and foot upwards between the tibia and fibula, he would recognise it by the extraordinary widening of the ioint, and the displacement outwards and inwards of the lower ends of the fibula and tibia, which are ready to burst through the skin on either side, and are also approximated to the sole of the foot, so that if the patient were to walk, the malleoli would touch the ground. The foot is quite immovable, being wedged between the leg bone^ and this seems to have been a very marked sign in the recorded cases.

In the ovary clusters of ovarian follicles are found here and there embedded in the tumour. Many writers refer to these tumours as adeno-sarco- mata, a term which needs to be strongly discouraged. It has already been pointed out that striated muscle-tissue occurs in spindle- celled sarcomata of other organs than glands, and it may be here mentioned that in the kidney, where myosarcomata are most frequently met with, when the striated cells are abundant, gland tu- bules are scanty, and often absent, and the converse of this is equally true. It has been urged that com- plicated sarcomata of glands should rank as a separate genus, but the convenience and justice of keeping them among sarco- mata is indicated by the fact that when a myosarcoma is re- moved and recurs, the recurrent tumour contains only round and spindle - called elements. The general characters of sarcomata.—It will now be ne- cessary to refer to the characters of sarcomata in general. The hlood supply.—The vascularity of sarcomata varies greatly. In all the circulation is mainly capillary. In the small round-celled species the vessels may be so numerous as to cause distinct pulsation and a loud murmur or “ hum.” The slow-growing spindle-celled species are poor in vessels. In tumours, which grow rapidly, the walls of the blood-vessels are very thin, and rupture from the force of the circulation, converting the centi'e of a sarcoma into a blood cavity. Tumours thus transformed were formerly described as “malignant blood cysts.” rig. 116,—Lympto-sarcoma of the Mediastinum inUltrat- iug the Lung.

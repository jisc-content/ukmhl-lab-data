466 TUMOURS. 12. Sarcomata. Fig. 112.—Microscopical Characters of a Lympho- sarcoma, from the mediastinum. Sarcomata are tumours composed of tissues resembling immature connective tissue, in -which cells preponderate over the intercellular substance. This genus contains six species, -which are deter- mined according to the shape and disposition of the cells; (1) Round-celled sarcoma ; (2) lympho-sarcoma; (3) spindle- celled sarcoma; (4) myeloid sarcoma; (5) alveolar sarcoma; (6) melano-sarcoma. 1. Round-celled sar- coma.—This species consists of round cells with very little intercellular substance. Each cell has a large round vesicular nucleus, and a small proportion of protoplasm. Blood-vessels are abundant, and often appear as mere channels between the cells; lymphatics are absent. These tumours grow very rapidly, infiltrate surrounding tissues, become disseminated, and recur after removal. There is a variety known as the “ large round-celled sarcoma; ” the cells are of unequal size, many contain two or more nuclei ; a few are multinuclear and resemble myeloid cells. The round-celled sarcoma is the most generalised tumour which aflfects mankind; it may occur in any organ, in bone, brain, muscle, spinal cord, ovary, or testis, and even in the delicate sustentacular framework of the retina. It attacks the body at all periods of life, from the foetus or the child just born up to the extreme limits of age. vertebrate animals it is ubiquitous. 2. Lympho- sarcoma consists of cells identical with those of round-celled sarcomata, but the cells are contained in a delicate mesh, and resemble the tissue of lymphatic glands (Fig. 112); hence the origin of the term. These tumours must not be confounded with simple (irritative) enlargement of lymphatic glands, nor with the general overgrowth of lymphadenoid tissue associated with leukfemia or lymphadenoma (Hodgkins’ disease).

ON HERNIA. 23 ment of it next to be described has seemed to be the most suc- cessful. Of the two alternatives—leaving the omentum in the sac and re- turning it—the former is attended with inconvenience and some risk, whilst the latter, in cases of any inflammatory affection of the omentum, is hazardous, and iu enlargement of it is questionable. These are risks not of simple inconvenience, but of life, and any means of avoiding them without incurring equal danger is most valuable. The loss of any portion of omentum contained in a hernial sac by removal, does not seem to have been found an in- convenience to the patient in any recorded case, and in the cases which have occurred at St. Bai’tholomew’s Hospital, the divided arteries carefully tied and sought out with warm water, have not given rise to any bleeding. AU the evils of returning the omen- tum and leaving it in the sac are avoided by its removal, except one; that is, its edges may adhere to the edge of the ring in the abdomen. Even if it does this, the bowel escapes being caught in the ring and sac by the omentum; and it even adheres here sometimes when it is free in the sac and no division has been made. These are matters of reasoning; but let us turn to the broad fact, and see if the results of cutting off the omentum are good; in short, if the patients so treated have done well. It is most satisfactory to look over the cases where the omentum has been removed. When the vessels have been carefuUy tied, every artery being encouraged to bleed, no bad consequences have ensued, whilst the risk attending the return of a healthy but necessarily well-handled portion of omentum has been saved, and the subsequent progress of the case has not been delayed by a tedious suppuration, or endangered by a second strangulation, caused, not by the neck or any part of the sac, but by the omentum itself.

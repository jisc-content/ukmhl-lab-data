The obturatrix artery^ when not coming off from the internal iliac, arises generally from the epigastric, next in frequency from the external iliac, and least commonly from the femoral artery. The parts at the femoral ring are so near each other, and any change in position makes so great a difference, that a dry pre- })aration of the obturatrix artery, as shewing its relation to Gim- bemat^s ligament, is of little value. The mere act of drying may just spoil the whole point of the preparation, and malce an artery appear in great danger, which in a careful operation would pro- bably not have been injured. In looking at the obturatrix artery, wlien arising from the epigastric in the recently dead body, three

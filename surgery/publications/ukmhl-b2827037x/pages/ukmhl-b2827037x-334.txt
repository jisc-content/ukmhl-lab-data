CHRISTISON (DR.)-A TREATISE ON POISONS, In relation to Medical Jurisprudence, Physioloffy, and the Practice of Physic. By Robert Christi^son,^I.D. F.R.S.Il. ^I’rofessor of Materia Medica in the University of Edinburgh, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, &c. &c. &c 8vo. 20s. cloth 4th Edition, enlarged and improved^ We cannot but hail with satisfaction a new edition of this standard classical book. Its merits are too well acknowledged for it to be necessary to say anything further in its behalf Wherever toxicology is known as a science. Professor Christison’s treatise is received as an authority of the greatest weight. Dr. Christison has himself revised the present edition • and having taken advantage, he states, of the numerous investigations which have been carried on during the last eight years in the several departments of toxicology in theleading countries of Europe, he has found it necessary materially to change the size of the work. He has not however, been obliged, he adds, in order to embody recent additions to our knowledge, to alter in any important degree, either the general principles formerly laid down in previous editions, or what he had previously stated as well ascertained general facts.”—Lancet.

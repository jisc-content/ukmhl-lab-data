CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. 70 CHAPTER V. INJURIES OP HEAD AND SPINE. Abscess of braiu after injury. Discharge of fluid from the ear after fracture or blows on the head. Indentation of the skull in children. Fractui’e of the base of the skull, with remai’kable deficiency of symptoms. Slow inflammatory changes occurring in the skull of a child after fracture, resembling hydrocephalus. Frac- tured base and apoplectic effusion. Bleeding in injuries of the head.

INJURIES OE TUB BONES OE THE UPPER EXTREMITY. G9 about the same part have had a nearly uniform result. Severe! injuries of the leg have not terminated so well as severe injuries of the arm. In the arm^ very large lacerated injuries have done well, but hi the leg this has been rarely the case. The injuries unth deep contusion and little laceration to the skin have been much more dangerous to life than the lacerated injuries with exposure. In .the injuries of the leg wliich have been left, and where mortification has ensued, amputation has sometimes been per- formed at the end of the case, to make a stump, but in the serious part of the case it has not been practicable. In the arm it has at times been performed when the mortification was spreading, but not always with success. A doubtful injury of the arm often gets well, but a doubtful injury of the leg very rarely. The crusliing of any part of the cai-pus, the separation of the proximal ends of any of the metacarpal bones, or crusliing of the coronoid process of the ulna, have appeared to be much more serious injuries than injuries to the olecranon. Compound fracture of the olecranon, exposing the elbow joint, has done weU; but compound dislocation of the ankle has been generally a most serious injury, and sometimes fatal. No joint, however, suffers so much with impunity, at times, as that between the carpus and thumb. When this joint is freely exposed, and the muscles torn, so that the thumb lies back on the arm, it will sometimes unite and do well.

INJURIES OF THE BONES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 57 is partially ulcerated, \vitli disease still in progress; tlie other joints, lioweveiâ€™, appear sound. The anterior ligament of the ankle, espe- cially on . the outer side, is thickened, and the ligamenta calc, cuboid, and calc, iiavic. are much shortened. The groove of the tibiidis posticus and flexor digitonun appears to be implicated in a fracture of the back part of the internal malleolus, so that these tendons come nearer the joint than usual; a portion of bone also beuig separated from the internal malleolus, has, by rubbing against the tibia, given rise to a growth of bone. The parts around the fibula are much thickened, and containt he lower part of a portion of the articular extremity of the fibula, separate from the rest of the bone, but attached to the anterior hgament of the ankle joint. In the following case the disease of the ankle appeared to have originated in an imsuspected fracture of the malleolus. A man was admitted with a swelled ankle, with fistulous open- ings. Ten months since he sprained liis ankle, but w'alked about dming the three following months : he then went to bed, and has been there more or less ever since. He died of diseased kidneys. The ankle joint was bare of cartilage on the ends of the tibia and fibula, as well as on the surface of the astragalus: the synovial membrane was tliickened, and the exposed bone was red, raw, and rough. A fistulous passage led into the joint. The lower part of the tibia, with the inner malleolus, had been broken off obhquely: the fracture had completely united, but not quite in its natural position, the broken portion being driven into the substance of the tibia.

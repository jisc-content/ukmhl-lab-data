ON FRACTURES OF THE RIBS^ LOWER JAW, AND PELVIS. 39 The mail remained in the hospital tliree weeks, and then went out well, except some ecchymosis and a very slight lameness. Laceration of the perineum, with fractured pelvis, independent of the injury to the uretlira, is a most suspicious thing; so much so, that the simple fact of the perineum being torn, in a case of violence acting on the pelvis, unaccompanied by any other sign, is alone enough to make one suspect the fracture of the pelvis to be very severe. When the pelvis is simply broken in the ramus of the ischium or os pubis, it does not seem that the skin of the perineum is often iujm-ed by the fracture: if it does happen, it is a very rare occurrence indeed. When the perineum is lacerated, and the finger detects a fractiue of the pelvis, it does not always seem clear that the bone has passed tlirough the opening, as the bone is often at some distance from it. Whether the broken part of the pehds is close to the opening in the perineum or not, the pelvis is very generally broken behind in these cases, either tlirough the ilium, or at the sacro-iliac symphysis, and the lacerated perineum is produced, either by the protrusion of the broken bone through the skin, or by the whole side of the pelvis giving way from the fracture behind and in front; the perineum is thus lacerated, either by the violent extension of the skin, or by the broken bone being carried tlirough the skin. If this is the mode in which the laceration occurs, the presence of a laceration in the perineum, independent of that jiroduced by direct external violence, is an important indication of the extent of injury in these cases.

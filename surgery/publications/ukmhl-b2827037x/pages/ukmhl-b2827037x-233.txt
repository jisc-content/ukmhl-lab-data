MEKCUKY IN SIMPLE AND INDURATED PRIMARY ULCERS. 21 I 111 six syphilitic ivarcls ot St. Bartholumeiv s Hospital, the mercury is chiefly given in blue pill, ivhilst in the other three ivards frictions are used to a considerable extent. The influence of both is marked, and each has its advantages and incon- veniences. The pill is simple, is not offensive, and does its duty wdthout any assistance; the frictions require some trust being placed in the nurse to do them properly, are inconvenient, and, where many in the same ward are using them, make the room foetid and un- healthy. Trictions, however, bring the patient under the in- fluence of mercury in the most decided manner, and where such an effect is desu’able are certainly the best means; they are also nnattended by the coho and diarrhoea which occasionally accom- pany the internal exliibition of mercury. AU tilings being borne in mind in favour of one method and the other, there seems to be no doubt that, when the decided influence of mercury is particularly required, the employment of frictions is most advis- able, but that in the great majority of cases the convenience of the blue pill ivill always ensure it a very general use. Such are the means used for the internal administration of mercury to produce a gradual action on the system, and wliich in the great majority of cases are sufficient. There are some cases, however, which, from the nature of the disease as well as the resist- ance of the patient to the influence of mercury, need an increase of the common dose, or require to be treated by the combination of one or tw'o forms—as the blue pill, as well as by the apphcation of frictions. When, however, a very rapid effect is deshed, calomel with opium is generally used. The cases of the indurated sore, however, where tliis is required, are not very frequent; tliis form of medicine being chiefly used in the kuid of primaiy ulcer next to be described.

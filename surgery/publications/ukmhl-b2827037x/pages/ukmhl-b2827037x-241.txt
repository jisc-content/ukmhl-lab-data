MEllCURV AND IODINE IN VENBIIEAL DISEASES. 225 Ajiioiigst the venereal patients admitted into St. Bartholomew s Hospital^ affections of the glands of the groin are very common, and of the most varying kind; they are more common amongst the male than the female patients, but some of tlie most serious kind occasionally are found amongst the latter. In some of these cases mercury is emploj'^ed in reference to the glandular affection alone, hut in the greater number the treatment is chiefly directed to the primary ulceration on which it depends. The employment of iodine in these cases has been tried occasionally, but not often, and in these cases its effect on the whole has not been very decided, and not at all comparable to that of mercury, wliicli in some cases is attended ndth the most beneficial results, wdiilst in others its employment is unnecessary, and even disadvantageous. Before describing the mode hi which mercury may be bene- ficially employed in the treatment of affections of the absorbent glands, some allusion requu’es to be made in reference to the treatment of a very large number of persons, who are always found amongst venereal patients, namely those who labour under primary ulcers of a mild nature accompanied with suppurating or ulcerated buboes, wliich are also destitute of any particularly severe character. In these cases the primary ulcer is made the chief object of treatment, and is often covered with a mercurial lotion, whilst mercury is administered internally; the affection of the groin being treated with simple means. This plan of treatment is not accompanied with any bad effects, neither does the heahng of the ulcer in the groin appeal’ to be delayed by it; on the con- trary, the heahng of the sore and of the abscess generally proceed simultaneously, and with the gi-eatest regularity, the one plan of treatment being beneficial to both. In examining the effects of mercury on the affections of the glands of the groin in the venereal disease, some arrangement is necessary, and as the presence or abseiicc of acute inflammation exercises on the whole the most important influence in modifying the treatment, the affections of the glands may conveniently be divided into two classes : 1st. Ihose in which acute inflammafion ofthe glands or surrounding cellular texture exists; and 2dly, tliose Ctusesiii which the glands alone are gradually enlarged, or iii winch, with the affection of the glands, considerable thickeiiiiig of the Q

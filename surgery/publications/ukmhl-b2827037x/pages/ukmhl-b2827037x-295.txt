279 SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OR MERCURY AND IODINE. CHAPTER XX. SYPHILIS. GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS DERIVED FROM THE EMPLOY- MENT OF MERCURY AND IODINE IN THE TREATMENT OF VENEREAL DISEASES. The patients admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital present primary and secondary venereal disease in aU its forms, from the mildest to the most severe, aggravated in many cases by in- temperance, bad diet, and a natmally unhealthy situation. The great mass of these patients are not submitted to any previous plan of treatment, such as bleeding, or a course of purging, unless some particular indication exists; in fact, even if bleeding were considered as a necessary preliminary, it would often require omis- sion, on account of the unhealthy condition of the patients. Wliere mercury is employed for the cm-e of venereal disease, the object had in view is to produce a shght degi-ee of soreness of the gums, with a coppery taste in the mouth, and also a somewhat increased flow of saliva for a certain period. This soreness of the gums is carried to a decided and somewhat painful degree in those cases wLere it is desirable to produce a well-marked mercurial influence on the system, but in the great majority of cases a yellow hne round the roots of the teeth, with redness of the gums, is thought to be quite sufficient. Tliis effect on the mouth generally com- mences in about five days, where mercurial frictions are employed every night, and in about seven or eight days where the blue pill is given in five-grain closes every morning and evening. Ptyalism, when once established, can generally be kept within bounds, the chief risk existing in arriving at the desired point. Hie existence of salivation, where much mercury is employed, is

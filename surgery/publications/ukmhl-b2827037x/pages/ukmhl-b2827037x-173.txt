AFFECTIONS AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. 157 1. Epigastric Ai'tery arising at the line of Crural Arch 2. Ditto 3. Ditto 4. Ditto 5. Ditto fi. Ditto 7. Ditto 8. Ditto 9. Ditto 10. Ditto Obturatm Artery ai-ising from Epigastric, after a quarter of an inch of its course Ditto after three-eighths of an inch of its course Ditto ditto Ditto ditto Ditto after half an inch of its course Ditto ditto Ditto ditto Ditto ditto Ditto after three-quarters of an inch of its comâ€™se Ditto after one inch and one-tenth of an inch of its course Ohturatrix Artery pass- ing half way between the inner edge of the vein and outer edge of G. Ligament. Ditto passing close to vein. Ditto ditto Ditto ditto Ditto passing not very close to vein. Ditto passing moderately near to vein. Ditto passing midway be- tween the vein and G. Ligament. Ditto ditto Ditto passing close to the vein (tortuous). Ditto _ passing on the inner side of thecrnral opening. In these cases^ the epigastric artery, where the ohturatrix artery arose from it, was much less in contact with the external iliac artery and vein than in the preceding cases, and had ascended a short way upwards on the abdominal muscles, and on the whole the ohturatrix artery lay less close to the vein and more mesiaUy than in the preceding cases. In only four cases was the ohturatrix artery close to the vein, and in two moderately near it. In three cases the ohturatrix artery lay between the vein and the ligament, and in one on the inner side of the crural opening.

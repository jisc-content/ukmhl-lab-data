Under the employment of cleanli- ness, and a constant removal of all moisture from the part, these structures generally cease to grow, and after they have got into a quiet state, the apphcation of ordijiary caustics in mild cases, and the removal with the knife in the more severe, are the easiest and most certain modes of completely removing the growths. In addition to warts there is also frequently met with another growth from the skin, or more commonly an elevation of the substance of the cutis, with swelling and some degree of inflam- mation, accompanied with a white sodden condition of the cuticle and some excoriation, from wliich a tliin acrid fluid at times exudes. To tliis the general term Condyloma is applied. These appearances present themselves under several circmn- stances, of which the following are the most common :â€” 1.

In men these lumps generally are rapidly removed by small doses of mercury; in women, however, they are much more intractable, but are reheved by the same plan of treatment. 2. Children labouring under the venereal disease, existing at bhth or commencing a few weeks after delivery, frequently present small growths of this kind on the skin in the neighbourhood of the anus : in general, blotches of the skin, or scaly eruption, with fissures at the angles of the mouth, are found at the same time. The same mercurial treatment which is beneficial to the general symptoms also assists in the removal of these growths. 3. This aflection occurs in patients who are suflering from scaly and tubercular syphilitic eruptions. On tlie parts exposed to moisture, as about the perineum and genital organs, patches of

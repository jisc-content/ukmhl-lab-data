218 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. CHAPTER XVI. SYPHILIS. EMPLOYMENT OP MERCURY IN PHAGEDASNIC SORES; OP IODINE IN PRIMARY ULCERATION; AND OP MERCURY AND IODINE IN APFEC- TIONS OP THE GLANDS, WARTS, AND CONDYLOMATA. In the phagedsenic ulcer the surrounding parts are inflamed to a considerable degree, udth effusion of fluid into the subcutaneous tissue, producing in the penis paraphymosis. The degree of pain existing in the sore is geuerally intense, but in some hospital patients this pain passes umioticed, and the part is said to be easy. The sore presents an irregular ragged everted edge in some parts, when the disease is spreading by ulceration, Vhilst in otlier parts the edge is not so distinctly marked, being continued into the adhesive substance covering the sore itself. The suilace of the sore is covered with a fu’m layer of a wliite ash-colom’ed or dirty white substance. This substance is firmly adherent to the sui’face of the sore, cannot be vdped off hke matter, and appears to be a secretion of the sore itself, mixed with the dead tissues resulting from the superficial mortification of the part. The rapidity with which tliis form of disease destroys the parts attacked by it is very great, and lienee when patients present themselves with only slight loss of texture in the parts after disease of some weeks, it is pro- bable in such cases that this form of disease has not existed during all that period, but that from neglect or other cause the sore has assumed this condition. This opinion, which is often rendered probable from the history, is shewn to be the fact at other times, where a sore previously marked by the characters of common

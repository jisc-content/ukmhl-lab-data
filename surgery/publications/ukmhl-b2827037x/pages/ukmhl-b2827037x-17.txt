Account of patients admitted, of patients operated on twice, of the date of strangula- tion, and of the general condition on admission. Employment of the taxis simply, or with other means. Circumstances occurring in the operation, before and after opening the sac. Fluid in the sac; its quantity as influencing the strangulation; its quality, whether transparent, brown, or bloody; its absence. Cases of patients with hernia and hernial symptoms suffering from other ailments. Cases of strangulation by the omentum. Treatment of the omentum.

The proportion of patients operated on, as compared with those who are admitted, is thus large; yet many apply and have their ruptures reduced. The same patient often has his rupture reduced once or twice, or even tlnee times; but it is more common for the second strangulation to need an opera- tion, than to be reduced by the taxis. Of those which are returned, the majority are cases of inguinal hernia, of moderate size, not long down, and not previously handled. The number of cases of femoral hernia returned is very much less than that of inguinal. No class of cases varies more than these, in appai’ently accidental circumstances; thus many cases happen together, many fatal cases occur together, and many sixccessfid operations occur consecu- , lively; yet it is very rare for two cases to be exactly alike in every H

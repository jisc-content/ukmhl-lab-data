MERCURY IN SIMPLE AND INDURATED PRIMARY ULCERS. 207 CHAPTER XV. SYPHILIS. THE EMPLOYMENT OF MERCURY IN SIMPLE AND INDURATED PRIMARY ULCERS. In the following pages, to avoid difficulty from the use of parti- cular terms, the words “ syphilitic ” and “ venereal” are em- ployed as these terms are used in common conversation in the wards, and thus, under the name of venereal affections, are included all those forms of disease which common consent has attributed to impure intercourse, and which are placed without hesitation in separate wards. These are divided into primary and secondary affections; the former including all the varieties of ulceration resulting from direct contagion, together with the affections of the absorbent glands and skin, caused by the local affection exclusively, whilst the latter includes aU the affections arising in any part, or at any tune, from that general unhealthy condition which is pro- duced by primary disease. This arrangement includes gonorrhoeal affections; these are, however, omitted altogether, cliiefly for the reason that mercury and iodine are not the remedies by which these affections are generally treated. Primary ulcers are divisible into three principal classes:— 1. Excoriations and simple ulcers, unattended by any peculiar characters. 2. Ulcers, accompanied by more or less defined sun’ounding induration. 3. Ulcers, spreading rapidly, and attended with rapid destruc- tion of ])arts, including both that form in which the ulcerative process is most marked, as well as that in which the parts are removed by a more or less complete sloughing process, con-

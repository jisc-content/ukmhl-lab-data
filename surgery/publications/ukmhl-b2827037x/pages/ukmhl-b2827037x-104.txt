88 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. first lumbar*. Pressure on tliis part would therefore act rather on the bunch of nerves tlian on the cord, and even if accom- panied with paralysis, would be a far less serious evil, and less likely to be complete, than if exercised on the cord itself. The nerves might thus escape pressure in the canal; they would also, in all probability, escape pressure at the intervertebral fora- mina, which are very large in the loins, being half an inch from before backwards, and which, by the obhque position of the verte- brse on each other, are in fact rendered much larger than when the bones are placed vertically above each other. It is deserving of especial notice, that in the case abeady described, as well as in those quoted, the depression between the prominent spines shewed that the bones were possibly placed obbquely on each other, and thus in that position which would be most hkely to be accom- panied with enlargement of the intervertebral foramina. * Jadelot, in Tr. dâ€™Anatomic Chirurg. et de Chir.

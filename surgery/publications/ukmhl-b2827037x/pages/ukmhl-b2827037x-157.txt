AKKECTIONS AND IN.TUUIES OF AUTERIES AND VEINS, 141 CHAPTER X. AFFECTIONS AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES AND A'^EINS. Dilatation of the common carotid aiiery. Rupture of the femoral arteiy, fi’om a blow, unaccompanied by other injury. Aneimsra of the femoral artery, from a wound, with peculiar auscultatoiy signs. Injuries of brachial, radial, idnar, and posterior tibial arteries. Ecchymosis occurring spontaneously, also recmTing without apparent cause. Coui’se of the obtm-atrix ai-tery, and point of origin of the arteria profunda femoris. The two following cases of dilatation of the carotid artery are related on account of their somewhat close resemblance to aneurism, which they sufficiently resembled to render them a matter of anxiety, but from winch they differed in so marked a degree as to render any immediate operative proceeding uncalled for. The dilatation occurred where some dilatation is generally found in old age, but in these cases it was chiefly on one side, and though occurring almost in the regular situation of dilatation, it occurred also in the common situation of aneurism :— A thin delicate girl, aged 25, was admitted under Mr. Lawrence, labouring under a round swelling on the common carotid artery of the right side, at its point of division, of the size of a kidney bean, but round, and with the long axis parallel to the vessel. This swelling pulsates with the artery, and can be completely emptied by pressure, but fills immediately on the jiressure being removed. It is doubtful whether any murmur is audible in it; there may perhaps be a very slight one indeed. Tlie correspond- ing point of the left common carotid is also somewhat full. Menstruation, and all the functions, are performed naturally. There is a murmur terminating the first sound of the heart, loudest towards the apex, and not very audible in the course of

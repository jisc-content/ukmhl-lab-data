The second edition is very greatly improved ; and the work, in its present form, may be regarded as a valuable text-book to the student of chemical pathology, whether beginning or advanced ; and as such we recommend it to the professional reader.”—Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. “ We need hardly say that we strongly recommend Dr. Rees’s unpretending treatise as a most useful companion to the pathological chemist. It has the advantage, now-a-days somewhat rare, of being equally instrurtive to the student and practitioner ; and we know of no better manual on the chemical analysis of the blood and urine to place in the hands of those who are joining themselves as pupils to the newly-founded schools of practical chemistry in this metropolis.”—Medical Gazette.

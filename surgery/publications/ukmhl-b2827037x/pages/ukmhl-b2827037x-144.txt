128 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. CHAPTER IX. ON AMPUTATIONS. Amputation of fingers. Dissection of an old stump, where the end of the metacarpal bone was left. Efiects of pressure on the fingers. Amputation at the wist and just above it. Flap and circular amputations of thigh. Division of vessels. Difference of degree of retraction of the vessels. Retraction of integuments spontaneously subsiding. Peculiarity of the stumps of the femur. lujimy to vessels of the leg. Mobility of the fibula. Cicatrix on tibia after flap amputa- tion. Calcareous arteries often unite well, and produce little inconvenience in some cases. Occurrence of jihlehitis, and cerebral affection after amputation. Division of tarsns. Removal of metatarsal hone. Dissection of three ulcerated stumps, from amputation, fr'om fi’ost-bite, and from injury. In amputating tlie fingers, the head of the metatarsal bone is often removed, and a very neat hand made, the space left by the missing finger contracting so closely that the vacancy, especially where the index finger has been removed, is very shght indeed. Some objection has been made to this operation, on account of the M^eakening of the hand thus produced, in consequence of the division of the strong palmar ligament, which binds the ends of the metacarpal bones together, and it has been therefore recom- mended in cases of labouring men, and in all persons who have to use the hand for duties requiring much strength, to forego the improved appearance for the sake of the power wliich is gained by leaving the head of the bone. It might be said that the little and index fingers, placed at the end of this ligament, and connected with it only by one side, are the least benefited by it; but then the removal of the ends of the metacai’pal bone belonging to these fingers places the fingers next to them in the same cir- cumstances in this respect in which ’ the index and little finger previously were placed.

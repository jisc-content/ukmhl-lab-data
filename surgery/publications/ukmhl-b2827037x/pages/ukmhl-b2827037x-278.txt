263 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATONS IN SURGERY. affection by common meanSj and the readiness with wliich it yields to the employment of mercury, inasmuch as the testicle of one side has been removed for enlargement connected with syphOitic disease, wliich recurring in the same form in the opposite gland has been cured with mercury.* This affection yields to mercury hi as complete and certain a maimer as syphihtic hitis does; iodine also exerts a certain influence on tins affection, but not in an equal degree to mercury. In the great majority of cases the employment of mercury internally and by friction is attended with the cure of this disease; the action of mercury being maintained for a considerable period, and accompanied with decided soreness of the mouth. There is, however, no doubt that although many cases yield to the employ- ment of mercury in tins manner, yet that if a mild course of mercury alone be practised, some cases capable of rehef even by mercury w’^ould remain uncured. Before it can be confidently pronounced that an enlarged testicle is incapable of rehef by mercury, it is necessary that the patient shoidd remam at home, that mercury should be decidedly but slowly employed, and that a decided effect on the mouth should be produced. The ordinary modes of employing mercury are sufficient for this, but no plan has appeared to answer so well as the constant apphcation of either the strong mercurial ointment or liniment to the skin of the scrotum,—a plan which has been attended with the most marked benefit in the cases under the care of Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Stanley, at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. * Dupuytren, Le9ons Orales, t. i., p. 48, Bimelles, 1836; also, Ph.

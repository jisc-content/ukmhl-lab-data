MEECUUY AND IODINE IN VENEREAL DISEASES, 257 notj however, in all these cases that the means at present known will restore the patient to health, and death will, in spite of all our best efforts, sometimes take place; for tins affection may be reckoned as one of the forms of syphilitic disease which terminates the lives of those wretched women who have devoted their youth to prostitution, notwithstanding repeated and severe attacks of syphilis in its most aggravated form. Superficial ulceration of the tongue occurs either in the form of patches or fissures, the former being most commonly found on the siuface, and the latter near the edges of the organ, but also frequently on its surface. These ulcerated patches of the tongue occur chiefiy nearer the root than the apex, and are generally more on one side of the mesial line than the other; they present an irre- gular, wliitish, bald surface, wliich appears to be more smooth than the surrounding parts, in consequence of the loss of the papillae.

The other form of superficial ulceration consists in fissures, which occur very commonly along the edges of the tongue, at other times in one or two spots on its surface, whilst occasionally the edges and whole upper surface of the organ are thickly covered with fissures, the surface of the tongue between these cracks presenting a raw and thickened appearance. These affections of the tongue rarely occur singly, and are generally accompanied with other symptoms of syjfiiilitic disease. The patches of ulceration are much more cui-able than the fissures, and in general yield to the same plan of treatment which IS employed for the removal of the accompanying disease. Tlie accompanying symptoms are generally such as are benefited by the em])loyment of mercury, being commonly fissures of the lij)s and scaly eruption of the skin: when, hoivever, no other s

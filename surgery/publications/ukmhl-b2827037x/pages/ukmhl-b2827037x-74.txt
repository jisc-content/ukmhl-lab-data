58 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. CHAPTER IV. INJURIES OP THE BONES OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Alteration in length of the dislocated humerus. Advantage of extension upwai’ds in some cases. Dissection of an unreduced dislocation on the inner side of the cora- coid process. Case of compoimd dislocation of the humerus into the axilla. Case of laceration of the circumflex nerve, with fracture. Practnre of clavicle. Union of clavicle in peculiar position. Cases of dislocated thumb. Injury to elbow. Severe fractures of arm and leg. In dislocation of the shoulder joint it is sometimes hard to account for the strange results of measurement. Even when the head of the bone is carried down into the axilla^ the arm is of the natural length in many cases; whilst^ where the head of the bone is carried into the subscapular fossa, and in contact with the subscapularis muscle, the shortening is occasionally excessive, and more than can be readily accounted for. Now in both these displacements the head of the bone is carried towards the central hue, whilst the elbow is at the same time separated in an unnatural degi’ee from the side; and as the acromion, from which the measurements are taken, remains fixed, the distance between the acromion and the outer condyle of the hmnerus is lessened. The degree of eleva- tion or depression of the head of the bone above or below the glenoid cavity may thus be concealed by the separation of the elbow from the side. In the following case of dislocation, extension upwards and backwards was employed with success, after extension in a liori- zontal hue had failed :— Sarah Wade, act. 62, admitted April 27tli, 1843, into St. Bar-

AFFECTIONS OP JOINTS. 127 proximal ends of the phalanges of the second, third, fourth, and fifth toes rested on the upper surface of the metatarsal bones a little above the metatarso-phalangeal joints, so that the distal ends of the metatai'sal bones projected out beneath the toes, their extremities being tliin, partially bifurcated, and destitute of cartilage. So changed indeed were they, that even if the bones had been restored to their position, they could not have rested there. The extensor tendons were tense, the flexors ran round the outside of the second, tlurd, and fourth metatarsal bones to the sides of the phalanges, not running over the back of the metatarso-phalangeal joints at all, whilst the flexor tendon of the fifth toe ran on the inside of the joint.

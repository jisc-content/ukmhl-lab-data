PREFACE. V the author a constant and increasing pleasure^ and beyond all others to Dr. Latham. I trust that these pages may shew that his advice and instructions have not been bestowed in vain; I would they had been as ably followed as they have been always freely and sincerely given. To the Medical and Surgical Ofhcers of St. Bartholomews Hospital the author's thanks are due^ and most especially to Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Stanley: from an attendance on the practice and chnical lectures of Mr. Lawrence the principal part has been learned^ whilst the remaining por- tion has been chiefly derived from the instruction and wards of Mr. Stanley^ whose constant kindness in affording every means of information can be but imperfectly appreciated from the brief narrations in the following pages. High Street, Oxeokd, August, 1846. b

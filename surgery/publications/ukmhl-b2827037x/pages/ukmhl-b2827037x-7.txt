PREFACE. The substance of the following pages was collected during an attendance on tbe Surgical Practice of Saint Bartholomew's Hospitalj extending over nine years—from 1835 to 1844. During this period a large mass of notes^ embracing the most varied matters^ and collected from the most widely differing sources, was gradually gathered together. They were the notes of a student who was anxious to learn his profession practically; so that much was recorded simply because it related to matters of daily applica- tion, much because it attracted attention from its rarity, and much, again, hard of explanation at the time, in the hope that more extended observation might shew its real value, and remove its original difficulties. Materials thus collected, in so wide a field of observation, and with such kind assistance and encouragement as the author has constantly received, recording the experience of a lai’ge hospital on common though important subjects, the occasional peculiarities of ordinary disease, and the post-mortem examinations of rare cases, as well as much that had been drawn from the practice and instruction of those who had enjoyed most extensive experience for many years, seemed to present facts which might be acceptable to many; and now that the portion which was hkely to be of interest to others besides himself has gradually grown and acquired a size which appeared to justify the author in pubhshing it, it is here presented to the reader in the form of notes, with such connecting description as may serve to explain the subjects more fully.

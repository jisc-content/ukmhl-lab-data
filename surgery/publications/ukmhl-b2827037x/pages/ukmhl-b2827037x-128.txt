112 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. synovial membrane^ the accompanying fever is greater than that commonly accompanying ulceration of cartilage, when occurring as a sequence of long standing disease of the joint; and there is not the awful agony of acute disorganization of a large joint eom- mencing as sueh. The relief attending the administration of in- ternal medicines, and the local abstraction of blood, give a degree of relief in these cases which cannot be obtained from these means in disorganizing ulceration of a joint. So marked, indeed, is sometimes the relief from proper means, and the restoration of the healthy condition of the joint, that these cases of apparently severe disease get weU before cases of common synovial inflammation, which have been destitute of severe symptoms of any kind. An attack of chronic rheumatism generally leaves the joints some- what stiff, swelled, and painful; from which condition they slowly but ultimately recover, uifless another or more attacks supervene, and by small and suecessive additions so materially affect the joint that eomplete recovery occurs mth difficulty. It occasionally, how- ever, happens that one joint remains hot and painful after the affec- tion of all the other joints has subsided, and when this occurs, tliis single joint is with great difficulty restored to its healthy condition, and is extremely Liable to become more or less seriously disorga- nized in a very short space of time. Thus a single phalangeal joint of a finger remaining swelled and hot after all the affection in the other joints has subsided, has been found almost on the first serious examination of the part deprived of cartilage; or in a patient lying quietly in bed, and complaining of an acliing, and an aching only, in one hip, the head of the femur has been found lying on the dorsum of the ilium. In short, however slight the lagging inflammatory symptoms may be, or however trifling the dull aching may be in a single joint, after the removal of an attack of rheumatism, so as these signs do exist, they shoidd be a source of the greatest anxiety. When all the joints are restored to an apparent condition of health after an attack of acute rheumatism, and the person per- forms all the duties and acts of life as well as he ever did, he may, perhaps, be considered well; but the simple fact of the joints having once been attacked, is alone an unfavourable circumstance, and appears to render them more liable, even at a comparatively

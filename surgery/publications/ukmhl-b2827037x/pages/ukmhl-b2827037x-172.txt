15 G CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. conditions of it are found; one, the most common, when the obturatrix artery lies on the inner side of the vein; a second con- dition, the most rare, when the vessel lies quite behind Gimbernat’s ligament; and a third condition, not very uncommon, when the artery lies about midway between the outer edge of the hgaraeiit and the inner side of the vein. The variety of the obturatrix artery arising from the epigastric M^as measured in fourteen arteries, in reference to these points: 1. The point at wliicli the epigastric came off from the external iliac artery. 2. The point at which the obturatrix artery came off from the epigastric. 3. The relation of the obturatrix artery, in each of these cases to the femoral vein and Gimbernat’s hgament: in fact to the crural opening. The following are the results:— 1. Epigastric arose from Ext. Iliac half an inch above crtu’al ai'ch Obturatrix Ai’tery arose from Epigastric after half an inch of its com’se The Obturatrix Artery ran over the inside of the External Ihac Vein. 2. Ditto Ditto The Obturatrix Artery ran close on the vein. 3. Ditto Ditto The Obturatrix Aiiery moderately close to the vein. 4. Epigastric arose from Ext. Iliac one half to tlirce quai'ters of an inch above crural arch Obturatrix ai'ose from Epi- gastric after quarter of an inch of its course The Obturatrix Artery ran just over the vein. In these four cases the obturatrix artery did not arise from the epigastric till this was half an inch long, yet the former vessel ran down close on the inside of the external iliac vein; for the origin of the epigastric artery being about half an inch above the crural arch, the epigastric artery ran down tliis half inch to reach it, and gave off the obturatrix not half an inch higher up on the walls of the abdomen than the external ihac artery, but almost in contact with it. In the ten following cases the epigastric artery arose on a line parallel to the crural arch.

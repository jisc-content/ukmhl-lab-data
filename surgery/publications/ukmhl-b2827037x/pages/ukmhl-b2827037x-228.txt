Thus sores of this kind lightly treated will sometimes last for weeks and months in an ulcerated state, whilst the period from the first appearance of the sore to the removal of the induration is very long indeed. The indura- tion, or hard cicatrix, remaining after the imperfect healing of the sore, is truly and essentially the same disease as the open ulcer, only in a less irksome form; its presence is inconvenient and painful, and from the slightest accidents it may become again ulcerated; its simple existence exposes the patient, not only to the risk, but also to the probable occurrence of syphilitic disease in a severe constitutional form. In short, from observation of the patients themselves, from the instructions of those whose opinion is most valuable, and from the evidence of the writers of the largest experience, there can be no doubt that the primary indurated ulcer, treated without mercury, heals very slowly aud imperfectly, and that the patient is by such treatment exposed to the chance of renewed ulceration in the same place, as well as to the probability of the occurrence of con- stitutional disease, not unfrequently even before the primary sore is healed. The treatment best suited for this affection is the general and local employment of mercury, which will be here described; con- sidering first its local, aud then its general use. It is important to consider, first, an objection which has been raised to the local application of mercury in the ulcerative stage of indurated sores; for if mercurial local applications are only attended with benefit after the ulcerative process has begun to decline, and their employment in the spreading stage is attended with an increase of ulceration, the benefit of their use is but small j for to stop a spreading disease is a point of great importance, but to assist ill the cure of one which is spontaneously declining is no very great gain. The frequency with which local mercurial appli- cations are made to primary indurated venereal sores, however, affords an opportunity of accurately estimating the value of local mercurial applications. ^^Tien much surrounding inflammation exists, and the sore is surrounded by a considerable portion ot inflamed skin, the general condition of the patient, as well as the condition of the part, indicate the propriety of the employment of

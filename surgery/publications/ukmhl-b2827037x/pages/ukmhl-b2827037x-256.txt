240 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSEIIVATIONS IN SUIIOEIIY. followed by the coinjilete subsidence of the squamous eruption, and similar benefit has been seen to attend the employment of iodine after the employment of mercury; but on the whole the advantages attending the use of iodine in the squamous eruption are not at all to be compared with those which attend the admi- nistration of mercury. Tubercular sypliilitic eruption, in the purely tubercular stage, is much less common than the scaly and papular diseases, as the eruption generally assumes a scaly appearance, or terminates in ulceration after a certain period. Amongst venereal patients, a certain number of cases, however, are met with who sufier from simple tubercular eruption of the skin, more especially of the face, the spots being scattered more or less closely to each other, but forming distinct elevations of a light coppery colour, and accom- panied with other secondary symptoms. When the patient^s health is good, and has not been reduced by any particular cause, the employment of mercury in small quantities is attended with giâ€™eat benefit; this eruption, in favourable cases, yielding quite as readily as the scaly eruption to the influence of that medicine, and often requiring even a smaller quantity. The tubercular eruption occa- sionally assumes a very mild form, which lasts for a few weeks, and ultimately terminates by resolution, the skin hardly undergo- ing any alteration, a simple light-coloured stain without any sepa- ration of the cuticle being the only change wliich ocem-s. The employment of hydriodate of potash in such cases is attended with benefit, and seems to act as well as mercury, to which it is preferable in cases where the general condition of the patient, or the nature of the accompanying s}Tnptoms, render the employ- ment of mercury unadvisable. The pustular eruption of the skin occurs occasionally as a secon- dary symptom in strong healthy persons, but most commonly the patients labouring under this form of disease are reduced in health, and have been more or less invalids for a considerable period. Where the health is not weak, where the eruption does not run readily into ulcers, and especially those of the semicir- cular form, but dries and scabs off, leaving a small moderately healthv sore, the enqdoymcnt of mercury in the same manner as in tlm scaly eruption, but witli close watching, is generally the

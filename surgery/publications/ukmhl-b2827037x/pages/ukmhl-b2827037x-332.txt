ACTON (ELIZA).-MODERN COOKERY, In nil its Hranclics, reduced to a System of Kasy Ppractice. For the use of Private Families In a Series of Receipts, all of which have been strictly tested, and are driven with the most minute exactness. By Eliza Acton. Dedicated to the Youn^ Housekeepers of Enirland New Edition, improved. Fcp. 8vo. illustrated by woodcuts, 7s. 6d. cloth. “The whole of Miss Acton’s recipes, ‘with a few trifling exceptions, which are scrupulouslv specified, are confined to such as may be perfectly depended on from having been proved be- neath our own roof, and under our own personal inspection.’ AVe add, moreover that the recipes are all reasonable, and never in any instance extravagant. They do not bid us sacrifice ten pounds of excellent meat, that we may get a couple of quarts of gravy from it; nor do they deal with butter and eggs as if they cost nothing. Miss Acton’s bonk is a good book in every way; there is right-mindedness in every page of it, as well as thorough knowled>>-e and ex- perience of the subjects she handles.”—Medical Gazette. “ ijflctufal anil ^uitjiral AINSLIE.-MATERIA INDICA: An Account of those Articles which are employed by the Hindoos, and other Eastern Nations, in their Medicine, Arts, and Agriculture, &c. &c.

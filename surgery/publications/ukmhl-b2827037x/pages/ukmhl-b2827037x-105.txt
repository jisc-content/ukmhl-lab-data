89 BURSAL TUMORS. CHAPTER VI. BURSAL TUMORS. Treatment by applications, and incisions, and removal. Suppuration at times only slightly painful. Bm’see about hand and wrist. Case of large binsa of wrist cured by opening. Bursa imder semi-membranosus muscle, with dissection of a case. __ Bursal tumors situated over the patella and olecranon ai’e treated successfully in various ways. If the sweUing is tolerably recent, the parts thin, and the enlargement chiefly dependent on the quantity of contained fluid, the repeated application of blisters, or the application of the tincture of iodine, are the best. When, however, the parts are thickened, or the enlargement of some standing, these means are slow and very uncertain; the relief pro- duced is indeed considerable, but the part again becomes painful on slight pressm’e. The best plan, however, seems to be, to pass a thread through the bursa, and leave it in. On the foUoudng day the bursa inflames and becomes painful; the thread may noM'^ be withdrawn, and tlirough the opening left by it a puriform se- cretion is gi’adually discharged, and the bursa becomes no longer prominent. These various plans of applying blisters, or the tiuctui'e of iochne, introducing a thread, or evacuating the fluid by puncture, are applicable where the part is enlarged and painful, the fluid being the ordinary secretion of the membrane lining the cyst, and not puriform in any way. Where, hou'ever, from the pain and .signs of inflammation round the bursa, su})puration may be sup- posed to have occurred, a free incision gives moi’e relief than any other means.

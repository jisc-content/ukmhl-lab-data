100 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. buigical disease is not only complicated by old organic disease pressing with a dead weight on the powers of the patient, but a recent acute affection arising in a patient already surgically ill, is not unfrequently fatal at a very early period. The low fever of the metropolis and large towns, by acci- dental circumstances—as mortification of the limbs or portions of the ear—shews how far the patient may be reduced by it alone; and hence it is not a matter of surprise, that even mild sur- gical ailments, when fever is added, should assume a severe cha- racter, or that the fever itseK should terminate fatally, when the patient is already reduced by injury or operation. The simple discharge of gonorrhoea, which produces generally mere excoria- tions, is, under the influence of low fever, a cause of the most severe form of sloughing phagedena; and three instances have occurred, in wliich patients, hardly aware of any important affec- tion of the uretlira, have been attacked, during convalescence from fever, with sudden effusion of urine into the perineum, from the uretlira giving way. Scarlatina, unaccompanied by any particular circumstances, has been known, when occurring in a patient from whom a testicle hadbeen removed, to destroy life by the rapid failure of the patient in a few days. In these cases a distinct and well marked fever is added to an already existing ailment, and the severity of the iUness is materially increased; there are, how- ever, surgical cases of the most serious description in which one cannot say that any tiling is added, but can only consider what might at first seem a peculiarity as a necessary accompaniment of the case. Exclusive of compound fractures, and other serious injuries, in which fever of a low type often occurs, there are sur- gical cases stiU more closely resembhng low fever. At the bedside of many cases of traumatic erysipelas, some patients after operation, especially after the removal of deep-seated tumors, and even in some cases of simple injuries, as broken ribs, one recognises the general condition of low fever, ivith the want of any prominent indications for any special treatment, but with the necessity of con- stant watching for the commencement of local affections. In looking over the notes of these cases, their resemblance to cases of low fever is very marked; there is the same failure, where active means were used, the same necessity for support but with less

MERCURY IN SIMPLE AND INDURATED PRIMARY ULCERS. 2il Pi'imaiy indurated ulcers are generally in the spreading stage on application being made for relief. At other times the hard cicatrix is the only remains of the primary afTection, and amongst the working classes these seem to be the only two forms com- monly seeUj as any induration preceding ulceration is eithei not noticed by them, or not considered sufficiently important to require relief. Primary indurated ulcers are often, but not necessarily, single; the accompanying pain is not generally severe, and the surround- ing inflammation is but shght. The ulcer is more or less round, seated on and surrounded by a bed of hard lymph, wliich terminates at its circumference by a more or less abrupt step into the sur- rounding tissues; the edges of the sore are sharp, whilst the surface of the sore may be pale, or browm, or spotted with blood, or it may present a whitish pasty appearance, with shades of a brownish or green tint. The induration remaining after cicatrization of the sore is met with in patients when the sores have recently healed, or have been cicatrized for some months, and differs in size according to the original induration. There are, however, certain appearances dependent on the tissue in which the induration is seated: thus on the skin about the perinseum, we find a firm hard mass, in- cluding the skin and subjacent cellular tissue : on those parts where the skin is thinner the induration is generally more flat and broad, whilst under the thin covering of the prepuce and nymphm, tlie mass of lymph forms a round tubercle, like a flattened pea or bean, Avhich, when the membrane is rolled over between the finger and thumb, shews its white colour through the tightened surface of the thin adherent skin or mucous membrane. In appreciating the effects of mercury or iodine, it is necessary to consider the changes wliich the indurated sore undergoes, if left to itself, or treated on a simple plan. The following appears to be the most common result under these circumstances. The indurations, whicli commence as such, sooner or later, from some cause, generally ulcerate, and are placed in the same condition as primary indurated ulcers ; these undoubtedly will hc-fd of themselves, but that process is tedious and slow, and when it does take place, is generally merely a partial cure, as the cicatrix

IV PREFACE. The first fourteen chapters relate to various subjects; the last six contain the substance of an Essay on the Comparative Merits of Mercuiy and Iodine in the Treatment of Syphihs^ to which the Jacksonian Prize of the Eoyal College of Surgeons for 1842 was awarded. The chief object in tins latter part is to give an ac- count of the treatment of Sypliilis at St. Bartholomew's Hospital^ Avhere nine wards are exclusively devoted to the treatment of venereal diseases. The number of cases related is considerable, and the context is often a relation or abstract of other cases. In aU, however, brevity has been studied, either by detailing only the part of the case bearing on the point, or by simply giving those additional particulars which a fair recital of the case required. Let it, however, be borne in mind, that the object of the fol- lowing pages is not to give a detailed account of diseases, or a complete description of any one surgical subject, but to present a series of observations on particular points, wliich, either from then- rarity or other circumstances have not been generally noticed, or which, by the cases here related, have been rendered more clear, and at the same time to relate the success of certain modes of treatment of important classes of disease from the observation of a large number of cases. The work claims to be no more than its title expresses,â€”collections made as the different subjects of observation presented themselves; and if the sudden transition from one subject to another should strike the reader as harsh, or the brevity with which any points are alluded to should seem to imply an omission, such faults will probably be pardoned, if the apparently unconnected details illustrate a great practical truth, or the small space allotted to an important subject contains some- thing new on points where others have already so copiously written. In offering the volume to the ])ublic, there is a debt of grati- tude due to those whose kindness has rendered the daily labour of

INJURIES OF HEAD AND SPINE. 87 upper part of the liuubar regions, it is plain, in many cases, how much more easily a displacement of a vertebra backwards or for- wards might here occm’, than in the other parts of the spine. The articular processes of the cervical and dorsalvertebi'3e,by their situa- tion alternately behind and before each other, tlu’ow a great impe- diment in the way of any displacement in these regions ; whilst an equal obstacle to displacement exists in the loins, by the articular processes being directed alternately obhquely outwai’ds and in- wards, as weU as from the sm'faces being convex and concave, and thus locking into each other. The superior articular processes of the twelfth dorsal vertebra look backwards with some inclination upwards, and the inferior articular processes of the second lumbar vertebra look obliquely out- wards and forwards; the former retaining the character of the dorsal, and the latter assuming the peculiar form of the lumbar articular processes, The intervening j oints, namely, the j oints of the first lumbar vertebra wdtli the lower processes of the last dorsal above, and with the upper processes of the second lumbar vertebra below, are almost enthely destitute of any antero-posterior relation to each other, but are united laterally, so that the superior processes look nearly directly inwards towards each other, and the inferior pro- cesses almost chi'ectly outwards; preventing thus most forcibly any lateral displacement, but being as much exposed to displacement in the backwards or forwards direction, as the cervical vertebrae are defended from it. The limbs are not always described as paralysed in the re- corded cases of this displacement; a circumstance of great im- portance, and explicable by the peculiar nature of the displace- ment, and the region of the spinal column in which the accident occurs. Let us examine this point also. In the upper part of the lumbar region tlie dura mater forms a large wide sac for the spinal cord, which ceasing about Ihe second lumbar vertebra, by its division into the bunch of nerves forms the cauda equina, and is thus, to a certain degree, less liable to pressure at tliis part. The origins of the five lumbar and five sacral nerves from the spinal cord are situated between a line corresponding above to the spine of the eleventh dorsal, and a line corresponding below to the

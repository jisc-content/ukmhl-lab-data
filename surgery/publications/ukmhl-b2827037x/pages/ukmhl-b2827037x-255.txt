239 MBUCUUY AND IODINE IN VENEREAL DISEASES. arises in distingiiisliing either the tnberculo-squamoiis or later stage of the papular eruption from the scaly disease, is not of extreme importance, as the same means produce good effects more or less in these tliree forms of disease. In no form of disease is the efficacy of medicine more marked than in the treatment of the scaly syphilitic eruption by mercury. Under the internal administration of mereury to such a degree that the gums are kept slightly sore, this eruption gradually fades and clears off, leaving a healthy skin below. In many cases no stain of any kind remains; but such is not invariably the case, as at times the pale copper-coloured blotch remains for some weeks, disappearing gradually, and certainly being relieved by the continued employment of mercmy in small quantities for a considerable time. The scaly eruption disappears so much more easily under the employment of mercury than by any other means, that tliis remedy deserves to be employed in the fii’st instance in almost aU cases, and in doubtful cases, where the scaly eruption exists with other secondary symptoms, these symp- toms being capable of relief by either mercury or iodine, the existence of the scaly eruption is sufficient to justify the employ- ment of mercury in preference to any tiling else. In some cases of mixed secondary symptoms the existence of the scaly eruption enables the surgeon to decide as to the employment of a particular remedy: there is, however, another set of cases in wliich the employment of mercury serves a double purpose, for the existence of a hard mass after the partial cure of an indurated primary sore is not unfrcquently followed by the appearance of a scaly eruption, ivith other secondary symptoms, winch yield to the employment of mercury, the same means relieving at once the secondary and the remains of the primary disease. Mercury exerts so gi’eat an influence in the cm’e of tlie scaly eruption, that iodine is rarely tried: the use of this latter medi- cine is not, liowever, always unattended with benefit. Wlierc tlic afl'cetion of the skin is considerable, the effects of iodine arc neither rapid nor very well marked; the eruption becomes paler, and in some parts is nearly removed, but the cure is imperfect, and very slow in its progress.

ABSCESSES OF THE ABDOMEN, HAND, ETC. 185 CHAPTER XIll. ABSCESSES OF THE ABDOMEN, HAND, ETC. Abscesses a])pearing on the walls of the abdomen and chest, and tumors which may be mistaken for them. Cases.—Sujjpuration on abdominal parietes after partmition. Case of abscess in iliac fossa, and recovery. Case of abscess, connected with the csecum, dissecting out the cellular tissue of the loins. Case of abscess in the abdominal walls, communicating with both the digestive and minary organs; patient surviving for seven months. Suppuration in the hand. Degree of danger to life in some forms of inflamed hand at times great. Probability of affection of the joints or tendons. Peculiar fluctuation found in the arm. Dehrium from matter amongst the muscles. Cases of inflammatory oedema of hand. Two cases of rapid mortification of the hand, occurring in persons labouring under gout, or obscure rheumatic pains. Mortification of the skin of the groin. Abscesses with ulcerated legs. Car- brmcle running its own coirrse. Poisoning with mercurial precipitate. Abscesses on the walls of the abdomen are not very rare, and are at tunes attended tvith great difficulty of diagnosis, even after the swelling has been opened and tlie matter evacuated. In a healtliy person, and even in a dead bodj'^, it is at times very difficult to say, whether a swelling on the abdomen or chest is protruded from beneath the muscles, or situated entirely outside them; but when the parts are thickened and painful, the difficulty is still greater. Tlie following cases illustrate this difficulty:—A man, mtat. 25, was admitted under Mr. Staidey, labouring under a fluctuating tumor over the upper part of the right rectus abdominis muscle.

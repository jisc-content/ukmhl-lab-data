248 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSEIWATIONS IN SUllQERY. CHAPTER XVIII. SYPHILIS. EMPLOYMENT OP MERCUEY AND IODINE IN AFPECTIONS OP THE THROAT, LARYNX, TONGUE, AND TESTICLE.

These structures are affected in persons of every variety of health, and with varying degrees of severity, the disease at times being so mild as hardly to deserve notice or treatment, whilst at other times the destruc- tive processes are rapid, and, from their proximity to the upper part of the larynx, extremely dangerous. The milder forms of venereal diseases of the throat affect the membrane covering the palate, cheeks, surface of the tonsil and tongue, with superficial ulceration; that next in severity is the excavated nicer of the tonsil; whilst the most destructive form of disease of the throat is rapid sloughing or ulceration of the pharynx. These forms of disease often shade more or less into each other, and are variously modified; but still the great mass are included under one or other of the above-mentioned heads, by their external characters as well as by the treatment which they require. The superficial inflam- mation of the fauces often terminates without any ulceration, and gradually subsides; at other times it is accompanied with the eruption of vesicles closely collected together, or with the forma- tion of ulcerated patches of elevated mucous membrane, to wliich the term condylomata has been apphed. Such are the mild forms in which superficial inflammation of the fauces terminates, instead of proceeding to the common form of superficial idceration; but

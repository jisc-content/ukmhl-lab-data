140 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSEllVATTONS IN SURGERY. 2. A limb had been lost by frost-bite, just below the knee, and re- quired amputation on aeeount of ulceration repeatedly occm'ring. On examining the stump, the ulcerated part was close over the bone, and was connected ivith the nerves and remains of the im- pervious vessels. The posterior and anterior tibial nerves were quite different in appearance; one was quite thin and wasted, the other was irregular, enlarged, and somewhat bulbous. In the following case the same diseased mass of tissue formed the irritable part of a stump remaining after injury to the foot. It diflered, however, in one marked respect, from the stump of the leg ndiich had been previously amputated. In that case the gi’easy mnscles, and the porous bone, shewed the little nse Avhich the ailing part had been to the patient, and the gradual absorption and change of structure wliich had been going on. In the follow- ing case the bone had stiU been used to support weight, and its enlargement illustrated the chronic inflammatory change wliich had extended from the stump to it:— 3. A mail was admitted, labouring nnder a painful sore on the end of the metatarsal bone of the great toe, wliich had existed unhealed during the two previons years, and had originally been caused by a waggon bruising the part. The sore was so inconvenient, that the foot was removed by Mr. Staidey, above the ankle, it not being clear that the tarsus was sound. The metatarsal bone of the great toe was covered on its distal extremity with a tongh substance forming the sore; this substance being closely united to the end of the bone. The extreme end of the metatarsal bone of the great toe was so much enlarged, and surronnded by such a quantity of thickened tissue, that it formed a ronnd mass as large as a walnut, pressing closely on the next toe. The rest of the toes and metatarsus were found, on close examina- tion, to be healthy.

172 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. passing spontaneously into the urethra^ this canal is not un- frequently blocked up. The removal of these substances from the urethra is often performed by passing instruments down the canal; but sometimes an incision is required. However small the calculus may be, it always seems tightly fixed; the wound appears to be much deeper than a simple incision into the urethra might be ex- pected to be, the tissue of the corpus spongiosum bleeds most freely, and by its elasticity keeps the wound closed during the operation, and prevents any good view of the bottom of the incision being obtained. The following is an instance of retention of urine from a calculus concealed by a pilimosis, the retention of urine being consider- able :—A little boy came to the hospital with retention of urine. He had a phimosis, and the catheter would not enter the urethra. The phimosis was divided, and a calculus was found to be stuck ill the orifice of the urethra, blocking' it up. This was removed, but still the boy could hardly make water. The house-surgeon introduced a catheter, and the water was drawn off, which the boy had not been able to void on account of the distended condition of the bladder, even when the stone was removed. There are amongst surgical instrmnents, sounds with little bulbs at the end, wliich are rarely used, and perhaps justly. The following occurrence well illustrates the accidents to which they may give’ rise;—A little boy came one morning to the hospital with symp- toms of stone, and was sounded by the house-surgeon with a bulbed sound. On withdrawing the sound, it came about as far as the scrotum, and then stopped. The bulb of the sound had hooked out the calculus in front of it. Mr. Stanley at his visit made an incision into the urethra, and the calculus was removed.

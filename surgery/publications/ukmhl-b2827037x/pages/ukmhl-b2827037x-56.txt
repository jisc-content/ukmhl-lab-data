40 CLINICAL COLLECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN SURGERY. ! CHAPTER III. INJURIES OP THE BONES OP THE LOWER EXTREMITY. llcdnction of dislocatiou on the ischiatic notcli sometimes unexpectedly easy. Cases of dislocated hip in young cliildren. Case of irreducible dislocation of the hip, and also of hip remarkably easy both of dislocation and reduction, both cases probably connected with fracture. Loss of power from simple blows. Fracture of the neck of the femur; advantages of the long splint. Fractm’e of femur iu the lower third into the Icnee-joiut, and its result. Case of laceration of the liga- mentum pateUm. Dislocation of knee. Um-educed dislocation of Imce. Dis- section of a dislocated knee. Fractiu’e of the leg, of the fibula, and of the head of the tibia. Fractures; their displacement, want of crepitus, and accompauyiug paiu. Consequences of fractime arising at remote periods. Although dislocation into tlie sciatic notch is generally reduced otdy by long extensioiL such is not invariably the case, A stout butcher was admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital in the summer of 1841, labouring under a dislocation of the femur into tlie ischiatic notch, Avhich had only just happened. The man was carried into the operating theatre, the pulleys applied, and every thing got ready lor long continuous extension. The cords had hardly been drawn well tight, when the bone quietly slipped into its socket.' Dislocation of the femur may occur iu very young cliildren. In the following cases, the head of the bone was in the ischiatic notch in the fust, and probably in the foramen ovale in the second case. A girl, five and a ludf years old, was admitted under Mr. Stanley, with a dislocated hip. At 6 p.m. on the jirevious day, a portion of eartli fell upon her. On admission the left lower limb was shortened, inverted, the toes resting upon the great toe a mSmSSm

CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCING CONVALESCENCE OF PATIENTS, 95 CHAPTER VII. ON CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCING THE CONVALESCENCE OF PATIENTS. Fi'equency of disease in patients requiring operation, or suffering from accidents'. Influence of drunkenness, organic disease, and want, in rendering operations and injuries in such cases fatal. Fatal cases of delirium tremens. Occasional peculiarity of symptoms in injuries of the head of persons mentally affected, as well as in habitually intemperate persons. Occurrence of phthisis in persons suffering from fistida in ano, as well as in persons affected with disease of the spine. The success of surgical operations, independent of the operation itseK, appears to depend very much more on attention to many small, than to what might at first sight be considered the great points. Actual preparation of a patient for operation by bleeding or purging, or going through a course of anything, is rarely practised; neither, after an operation, are opiates, or any other means, ordinarily used to relieve what must necessarily happen. Although the health of patients is not attempted to be insured by doing great things, or adopting any defined course of proceeding, yet the real condition of patients requiring operation, and the existence of any particular circumstances of an unfavourable nature, are in practice accurately noticed. The favourable termination of amputations, and other operations, in patients who have been long under treatment, as compared with the same operations performed on patients in full health, illustrates the suitable and unsuitable conditions of two great classes respectively for operation; mere reduction of the standard of health within moderate limits being often Iâ€™ather a gain than a loss. Independently of the existence or non-existence of disease

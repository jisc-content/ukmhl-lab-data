This bursa was about the size of the end joint of one of the fingers, disappearing into the popliteal space, and lying partially on each side of and below the tendon, on extension of the knee. This bursa was^firmly fixed in the cellular tissue externally, being, however, smooth inside, and contained a fluid resembling rather thin apple-jelly. The bursa extended a short distance on each side of the general cavity by two small prolongations; these, how- ever, did not open into any joint, bursa, or other cavity. A natural bursa was found lower down, on the tendon of the semi- membranosus, corresponding to the bursa usually described as lying between the tendon and the inner condyle of the femur. This affection does not in general produce such inconvenience as to require an operation- Blisters and the tincture of iodine make the same, and as slow, an impression on swellings of this kind as on other bursal tumors; occasionally, however, the appli- cation of the tincture of iodine produces considerable increase of swelling and irritation of the part, if applied whilst pain or in- flammation exists. The application of mercurial ointment is not attended with any benefit.

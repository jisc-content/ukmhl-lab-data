This gives a distance varying from 1|- to 4|- inches, or an average of about 2|- inches, and allowing half an inch for the obli- quity of the sartorius, would give about tluee inches as the distance on the inner side of the artery, from the crural arch to the point at which the artery is completely covered by the muscle. The point at which the profunda is given off varies very much, even in the two limbs of the same body. To ascertain its exact point of separation, the distance from the crural arch at which this vessel was given off from the femoral artery was measured in nineteen bodies, or thirty-eight femoral arteries. The point varied in these from half an inch to nearly 3 inches, but gave an average of about 1-f- of an inch as the point of separation. In these thirty-eight cases the point of separation was between and 2 inches in twenty-two cases; at a distance exceeding tliis in nine cases, and at a distance less than this in seven cases. In this way the sartorius would reach the outer side of the femoral artery about an inch below the point at which the profunda is generally given off.

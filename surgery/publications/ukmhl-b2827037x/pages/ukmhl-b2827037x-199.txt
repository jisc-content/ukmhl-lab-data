Tlie subclavian ai’tery has been found much larger on the side^ corresponding to an enlarged lobe of the thyroid gland, this en- largement ceasing after the inferior thyroid artery was given off:— An old woman had a solid enlargement of the right lobe of the thyroid gland to about three times its natural size. The superior thyroid arteries on both sides were large and tortnous; the right inferior thyroid was, however, especially large, long, and tortuous. Tlie arteria innoramata was rather long, and perhaps of large size; the two subclavian arteries presented, however, a remarkable dif- ference in size. The right subclavian artery, before giving off the inferior thyroid artery, was very considerably enlarged in diameter; this enlargement stopping abruptly, however, at the point of separation of the inferior thyroid, beyond which the riglit subcla- vian artery was of the same size as the left in the same iinrt; the previous part of the latter being also of the natural size.

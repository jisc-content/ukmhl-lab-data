TREATMENT—CASES. ^ 213 removed all the wadding aud pellets within reach, together with portions' of torn muscles, and also made a counter-opening. Charcoal poultices and warm-water dressings were then applied; the sloughs separated, some more pellets came away, then the wound granulated and healed perfectly, the irritative fever ceased under local and constitutional treatment, and this man was able to take part in rowing aud working at the herring- fishing three or four months afterwards. These two cases, when contrasted, will show how difficult it is to estimate the amount of injury inflicted by small shot: the one case required amputation, though it did not at first appear to be such a serious injury as the other—probably owing to the metacarpal bones being injured and the confined nature of the wound. In another case lately in hospital, a boy received a small-shot wound in the axilla, which looked comparatively trifling, but the subscapular muscle was torn up and the surface of the scapula laid bare to a small extent. The case went on well for some time ; but ultimately the patient died from pyfemia and secondary abscess, resulting, I believe, from the injury to the bone. In another case of a young gentleman under my care lately, for a small-shot wound of the hip, the greater part of the glutei muscles were torn away, the sciatic notch and nerve exposed, and the gluteal artery wounded, but no bone was laid bare ; and this patient made a good recovery, the wound healing with very little scar by the contraction of the skin which had been thrust aside. It is always therefore, I believe, an unfavourable condition when bone is laid bare, as this increases the danger. The two cases related which recovered, looked much more formidable than the other two, but in neither of them was any bone injured ; while, in the case which required secondary amputation, the metacarpal bones were deprived of their periosteum, and in the fatal wound in the axilla, a portion of the scapula was denuded.

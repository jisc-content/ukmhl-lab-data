Specific Ulcers continued—Lupus : its progi-ess, appearance, and usual site ; its Treatment—Objection to the use of Nitric Acid—Importance of Treatment directed to tlie general health—The Scorbutic Ulcer : the conditions which precede and accompany it ; its Treatment almost entirely constitutional. The Varicose Ulcer. Lupus is a form of specific ulcer very like the cancerous, and often confounded with it. It occurs sometimes in connection with the syphilitic taint, hut most frequently with the strumous dia- thesis. Lupus may commence in either of two forms. The one has been described as tuberciilar; the other as herpetic. In the first form the skin becomes thickened and has a tubercular appearance. In the latter form, the skin breaks out into small pimples, each of which bears a vesicle at its apex. These at length coalesce, and then burst and form a sore. The base becomes thickened and the sore gives off a dirty grey discharge. These small sores tend to become gradually larger and more irritable, until at length they merge into one, assume a tubercular form, and true lupus is established. The site where it occurs most fre- quently is the nose, cheek, or angle of the mouth, and the progress is both rapid and destructive. When it attacks the nose, the lupus is generally of the tubercular form, and after the ulceration has proceeded for some time it assumes the following characters :—The edges of the sore are red, ragged, and irritable. At first they present a sharp outline, as if cut out, but are not much thickened or hardened. They therefore give way rapidly, and so the ulcer extends both in surface and in depth, eating outwards, irregularly, in different directions xmtil at length the whole side of the face may become one mass of disease. The surface of the ulcer is uneven, of a- dirty grey or ash colour, and exudes an unhealthy-looking discliarge.

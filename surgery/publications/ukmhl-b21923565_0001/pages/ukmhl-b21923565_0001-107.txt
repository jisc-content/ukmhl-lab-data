INDICA TIONS FOR OPERA TING. 79 strength will be worn out^ and we will Lave to amputate much higher up the limb than we might have done before. In this case, there is no advantage in postponing the operation, as the part is past recovery, and the sooner it is got rid of the better. Should, however, the history of the case, the nature of the injury, and the constitutional conditions, lead us to suspect that the gangrene does not entirely depend on the injury, the question of amputation becomes more difficult. The case is un- favourable in any way ; still if, after making free incisions to relieve tension and allow the gases and fluids to escape, and the use of antiseptic poultices, the gangrene continues to spread, the safest plan is to amputate early, without waiting for a line of demarcation. Even though the gangrene be spreading, I be- lieve the best chance for the patient is to amputate, but in doing so we must cut very wide of the apparently diseased textures.

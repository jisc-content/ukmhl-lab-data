SUPPURATION. 36 rectal fascia, and levator ani internally, and the strong obturator fascia externally, makes its way towards tlie rectum at the inner and lower part of the space where the ischio-rectal fascia becomes thin and cellular immediately above the sphincter ani, and there it undermines, thins, and ultimately perforates the bowel ; the abscess very generally opens also towards the integu.ments of the hip, and so gives rise to sinus or fistula. Another example may be found in the case of a perineal abscess, where there is great danger of the matter burrowing, and finding its way into the urethra. Again, an abscess situated at the root of the neck is more likely to burrow and extend behind the pleura, or, by ulceration, to perforate it, than find a way of exit through the more superficial textures. If the abscess be situated higher up in the neck, the matter may press injuriously on or even ulcerate into the larynx or pharynx, and that even in a shorter time than it could possibly make for itself an opening externally through the dense fascia of the neck. Then we have, in addition, the too familiar example of a similar destructive process, in the ordinary whitlow, which, if left unopened, leads to destruction of the softer textures, and even of the bone itseK; because the apo- neurotic sheath of the tendons of the fingers, beneath which it has its origin, being too dense to give way, the inflammation must extend underneath. The rationale of the processes which cause these dangers being understood, the indications as to treatment must be obvious, and they are simply these :—to make earty and free incisions, so as to give ample room for the evacuation of the pus, and thereby avert the evil consequences which we have just been considering. To the second class of dangers—those arising from the encroachment of an abscess on important vascular structures— belong those cases in which the coats of an artery may be ulcerated through, and serious or fatal hemorrhage take place in consequence. The very possibility of such a result as an artery giving way in the cavity of an abscess, is denied by some ; yet the evidence in support of it is to my mind conclusive. An

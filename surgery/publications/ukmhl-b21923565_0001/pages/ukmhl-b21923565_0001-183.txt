149 MALIGNANT. is not the same definition in the osteoid cancer as there is in the exostosis. The tumour rapidly develops itself and gradually involves the condyloid portion of the bone. The cachetic ap- pearance of the patient, the rapid growth of the tumour, and the quick pulse, all indicate the true nature of the disease. The growth itself is very dense and hard, and feels like ivory, which renders its diagnosis more difficult. Softening gradually takes place at some parts ; but the great mass of the tumour is very dense. The disease is one rarely met with. In two cases which occurred in my own practice, amputation was per- formed ; in one of these the disease returned in another part of the body and destroyed the patient. This tumour belongs to the carcinomatous form of malignant growth, its cells being exactly like those of carcinoma. There is another form of malignant disease affecting the condyloid parts of bones, which in its early stage is often difficult to diagnose from joint-disease. It generally occurs about the elbow and knee joints. There is at first some slight swelling, with little pain, and we are apt to treat the disease lightly ; but we ought to watch such patients very carefully, for, after a time, symptoms come on which give us an indication of the true nature of the disease. Then it develops itself very rapidly, owing to the loose reticular texture of the condyloid part of the bone; and a section, as you perceive, presents appearances almost exactly similar to those of the medullary tumour of the soft textures. TliG Treatment is the same as in other malignant tumours of boneâ€”early amputation wide of the disease.

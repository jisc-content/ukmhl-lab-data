FIBRO-PLASTIC OR RECURRENT. 139 of tlie former growth, was observed to increase very rapidly. This also was removed. It was highly vascular, and its section was exactly similar to that of the abdominal tumour—namely, fibro-plastic. The tumour on the scalp had only been growing a few months. The tumour on' the abdomen was removed, as I have said, two or three times, and each time getting more softened, the patient's health gradually deteriorated, and he at last died, exhausted by the disease. This case, as compared with the former, was truly a malignant disease connected with the constitution, whilst the former was not malignant, but a simple recurrent tumour. The malignant'is much more common than the simple fibro-plastic tumour, and is merely a sub-division of the soft medullary tumour, containing a larger amount of fibrous structure than usual, but still truly malignant. In the true recurrent tumour there are not many free nuclei, nor are there the same proliferous cells present as exist in the malignant recurrent growths. In these, even though the malig- nant symptoms may not appear at first, yet they become more evident after each removal of the tumour ; while if the tumour be a true recurrent one, the patient's general health remains unaffected. In another case of malignant recurrent tumour in a young woman's limb, Mr. Syme removed the growth once. She siibsequently applied to me with the tumour at the site of the old cicatrix. She would not submit to its removal a second time, and then the tumour sloughed out, but the edges—as in malignant growths generally—refused to heal The malignant fibro-plastic growth has the same proneness to involve other textures, as all medullary tumours have, while the simple fibro- plastic or recun-ent tumour exhibits no such tendency.

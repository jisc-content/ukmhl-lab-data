I LECTUEE XIIL Chronic or dry Gangrene : its causes and treatment—Senile Gangi-ene of Pott— Evils of former mode of Treatment "by over-stimulation—The more rational mode now adopted—Gangrene arising from Ligature of a Vessel— General recapitulation of the question of Amputation iu the different forms of Gangi'ene. Chronic Gangrene is generally, though not always dry. The constitutional causes may be temporary or persistent. Tem- porary causes are seen after scarlet or typhus fever, when there is a tendency to form bed-sores. These are patches of gangrene formed over the buttock or other part upon which the patient has lain long ; the gangrene is due to pressure and the diminished vital power. Chronic gangrene of the toes and feet often arises from the febrile excitement and debility resrdting after fever, and here, the cause being only temporary, the constitutional symp- toms do not come on if proper treatment be adopted. The con- stitutional causes may, however, be persistent. They are very different from the temporary causes. In some cases embolism is the cause. Embolism is the plugging and consequent occlusion of vessels produced by either clots of blood or growths from the valves of the heart being driven from the heart into the smaller vessels. Or there may be some inflammatory affection of the coats of the bloodvessels, leading to their occlusion. In these cases the irrita- tive fever is very marked. The constitutional symptoms are often absent or slight in chronic gangrene arising from temporary causes ; and the gangrene has a tendency to spread ; so that we cannot operate in such cases, because we do not know where the cause—the obstruction of the vessel—may be. In chronic gangrene resulting from constitutional causes of a temporary character, as after fever, the local treatment is limited to apply- ing a poultice, not too warm, to the part, or keeping it wrapped up in cotton wadding so as to preserve its temperature, and avoid- I

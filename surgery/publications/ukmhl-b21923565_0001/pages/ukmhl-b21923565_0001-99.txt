It is in the general treatment of the two different forms of phagedaena that we require to exercise the greatest discrimination. In black phagedaena there is, in the earlier stages at least, violent local action, and hence we require to exhibit small doses of anti- mony with opium, or minute doses of belladonna or aconite, giving, at the same time, farinaceous and milk diet where the patient can digest that, and as far as possible avoiding wine or other stimulants ; but at the same time we must recollect that by and by the blood-poisoning will induce typhoid symptoms, so that we must not carry the antiphlogistic treatment too far. In the latter stages of the black phagedsena, and from the first in the grey form, great benefit will be found to accrue from the use of tincture of muriate of iron or the sulphate of quinine, after the digestive organs have been attended to. The diet also will re- quire to be more generous than in the early stages of black phagedaena. In many cases opium requires to be exhibited largely, and seems less productive of bad consequences, or inter- ference with the digestive organs, than under ordinary circum- stances. When the disease appears as a result of endemic causes, as in hospital practice, no treatment can be expected to be of use so long as the originating cause is in operationâ€”the patients nmst, as soon as possible, be removed elsewhere, to tents, or sheds, or any accommodation that can be obtained till the wards are thoroughly cleaned and ventilated.

TETANUS. 234 We know very little about tlie general pathology of teta- nus. In the traumatic form we have the lesion of the superficial nerves giving rise to irritation in the nervous centres, and these reacting upon the muscles. In many cases we find the injured nerve inflamed, the neurilemma more vascular than usual, and irritated at the injured point, and we infer that the excitement of the distal part of the nerve has led to the disease of the nervous centre. The post-mortem appearances in tetanus are similar to those of all spasmodic or convulsive diseases : there is engorgement of the veins about the spine, depending on active congestion of the part; and there is al- ways more or less serous effusion ; but these conditions may be produced by the very symptoms which preceded death—the spasms and convulsions. There is seldom much irritation of the mucous membranes, or internal congestion of organs, except the nervous system, though in some cases the great vessels of the lungs are congested. The distinctive appearances of the disease are, the irritation of the nerves injured, wliich are inflamed and irritable for some little distance upwards, and also the congestion and in- creased vascidarity of the medulla spinalis, and especially the congested condition of the rachidian veins. Treatment of Tetanus—The first thing to be done is to allay the irritation, and to get rid of the exciting cause by removal of any foreign body which may be present—by the division of par- tially divided or torn filaments of nerves, as in lacerated wounds —by making a clean incision round the torn part, or by ampu- tating the limb if it be not too late. After any for-eign body has been removed, poultices, either simple, or medicated with solu- tions of tobacco or opium, or warm anodyne fomentations may be applied, or the injured limb slung in the warm-water bath, which may be medicated with opium or tobacco. At one time the number of infants who died in the West Indies from trismus or lock-jaw was very great, and on examina- tion it was found that the midwives attending the mother during confinement used to apply remedies of their own to the cord of the infant, which led to great irritation, but when these were

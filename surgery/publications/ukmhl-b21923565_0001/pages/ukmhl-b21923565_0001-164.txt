LECTURE XXI. Medullary Sarcoma or Soft Cancer: its External Appearance, Anatomical Structm-e, Growth, and Degeneration ; the constitutional evidences of its existence— Melanosis or Black Cancer—Treatment of tlie various Forms of Medullary Sarcoma, Fibre-plastic or Recurrent Tumours—Cases illustrative of the dis- tinction between Simple and Malignant recurrent Growths. In my last lecture I concluded what I had to say with regard to carcinoma, and I now proceed to consider the Medullaey Sae- COMA, CEEEBEIFOEM TUMOUE, Or SoFT Cancee. These different terms indicate very well the general characters and appearances of the disease. When seen recently, the tumour is exactly like a portion of brain substance, and is therefore called cerebriform. The tumour is generally of a soft consistence, masses of brain- like matter occupying the interstices of a fibrous texture which composes the solid part of the tumour, and which is arranged in septa throughout. This fibrous tissue, as well as the soft matter, is truly malignant, and part of the tumour. After maceration, or when the tumour fungates, the brain-like matter disappears. Like carcinoma the sort cancer contains the peculiar proliferous cancer cells, though to a greater extent than in the hard cancer. The tumour varies as regards the degree of vascularity, but it is always highly vascular. On injecting one of these tumours, we find throughout the growth some portions of amorphous-looking matter not permeated by vessels; but the greater part of the structure is seen to be very vascular. In some cases we find that a single large vessel enters the substance of the tumour, and forms a dilatation or sort of pulsating vascular pouch not unlike an aneurism. Occasionally, when the tumour is very vascular, the brain-like matter gives way after a time, and the fluid blood passes in from thp ruptured vessels, and a sort of pulsating feel- ing along with fluctuation is produced.

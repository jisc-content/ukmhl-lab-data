Suppuration—Pus, its Nature, Varieties, Microscopic Appearances, and Chemical Constitution—Tlieories as to the Origin of Pus—The Cellular and Molecular Theories Compared — Superficial Suppuration—Interstitial Suppuration or Abscess: Acute and Chronic ; Circumscribed; Diffuse and Infiltrated Abscess Diagnosis—Treatment. One of the most common terminations of inflammation is that termed Suppuration. A fluid is formed during this process to which the older surgeons gave the name of pus, because they imagined that it resulted from putrefaction of the textures implicated in the diseased action. Healthy or " laud- able " pus, is a pale yellow-coloured fluid of the consistency of cream, though somewhat more tenacious. According to some curious investigators it has a sweet and mawkish taste, and it is bland and unirritating ; it has a peculiar heavy, somewhat sickly odour. A second form of pus is known as serous, curdy, flaky, or scrofulous. It is thin, like whey, and is mixed with flakes of broken-down lymph, or perhaps coagulated albu- men ; such pus indicates a low, weak condition of the system. It is generally found in chronic abscesses. A third form of pus is termed sanious, grumous, or bloody. It is thin, and of a brownish-red colour, and is generally secreted by irritable or unhealthy surfaces. A fourth variety of pus is termed ichor. This is a thin irritating fluid of a disagreeable odour. An example of it is seen in the discharge from malignant or specific sores, such as cancer. Under the microscope, pus is seen to consist of nucleated cells floating in a liquid termed the liquor puris. Each pus-cell is about the l-3000th of an inch in diameter—globular—slightly irregular on the surface, lilve a mulberry ; when acetic acid is added to it, it causes the cell to distend and the ceU-wall to become very transparent, while

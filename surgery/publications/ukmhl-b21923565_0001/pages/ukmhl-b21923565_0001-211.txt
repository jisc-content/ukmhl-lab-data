In a former lecture I alluded to the healing process, and dwelt on the distinctions between and the conditions affecting primary and secondary union. It will be useful for you to remember these particulars, now that we are about to consider the various solu- tions of continuity of the surface, and deeper parts of the body, which are generally recognised as wounds. Wounds are classified under the following heads :—Incised, Punctured, Lacerated, Contused, Gunshot, and Poisoned. We shall first consider the Incised. This is the simplest form of wound, and includes most of those made in surgical operations. It is inflicted by a sharp cutting instrument, and the textures are divided evenly and smoothly ; there is no tearing, bruising, or twisting of the parts, and hence the in- cision is attended at first by smart hemorrhage, more so than most other forms of wound. This results from the vessels being cleanly divided, so that the hemorrhage proceeds until they retract within their sheaths, or until the system becomes affected by faintness from loss of blood. If the wound has been made parallel to the axis of the limb, and to the course of the subjacent muscular fibres, there is no gaping of the edges so long as the part is kept in position ; but if the incision be transverse to the axis of the limb, or if it has divided transversely the subjacent muscular fibres, then the wound will gape, and the deep part more largely than the superficial, owing to the retraction of the divided muscular fibres. If the N

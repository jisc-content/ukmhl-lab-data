SECONDARY AND TERTIARY 171 goes on increasing in size, then the best thing to do is to divide the frtenum, otherwise the diseased action destroys it ultimately by the ulcerative process, and the chancre may ulcerate into the urethra. After cutting the fraenuni the sore will heal readily. Here also M^e must watch against hemorrhage, not so much at the time, but from oozing afterwards, when the irrita- tion causes the penis to become semi-erect, as it often does. Cold-water dressings, or ice, will, however, be sufficient to re- press the oozing of blood. Fissures or cracks as symptoms of secondary syphilis occur about the edges of the nails and between the fingers, at the edges of the lip and on the tongue, and by the side of the rectum, where they assume all the appearances of fissure of the anus, but not healing so readily under treatment. In the tongue these fissures are very common, and when of long stand- ing they assume characters very like those of cancer. In one case of this kind every remedy had been tried, both locally and constitutionally, but without avail, and I began to consider it a case of cancer supervening upon syphilitic affection ; the patient was suddenly seized one night with urgent dyspnoea for which tracheotomy was at once performed, and immediately afterwards the ulcer in the tongue began to heal rapidly ; in this case all the marked appearances of cancer were present, but when once the source of irritation was removed the true nature of the disease was evident. Sometimes we may require to divide the fissured ulcer of the anus, as is done in ordinary fissure of the anus, but as a rule this is to be avoided, unless there be very great pain ; it is better to apply nitric acid or nitrate of silver on the surface, and give iodide of potassium or the iodide of mercury or gray powder internally. Tertiary Syphilis.—It is very difficult, in fact almost impos- sible, to draw a line between secondary and tertiary syphilis, and say definitely when the one ceases and the other begins ; we must judge in great measure from the appearance of the patient—the secondary symptoms may show themselves even be- fore the primary sore is healed. The tertiary symptoms gener- ally occur some considerable time after the chancre has healed,

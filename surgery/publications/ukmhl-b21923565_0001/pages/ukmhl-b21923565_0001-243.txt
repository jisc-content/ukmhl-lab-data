LECTURE XXXI. Wounds inflicted by the Bursting of Firearms — Their Treatment — General Treatment of Gunshot Injuries—Extraction of Balls and other Foreign Sub- stances—Openings and Counter-Openings—After-Treatment—Eisks of Se- condary Hemorrhage—Prognosis—Cases. Before entering on the subject of the general treatment of gun- shot wounds, I have a few observations to mal^e regarding in- juries inflicted by shot entering through a small aperture and then expanding, or by the bursting of firearms. In many of these cases there can be no doubt as to the propriety of amputation ; and here the danger is rather in an inverse ratio to the size of the external wound, the danger being also greater if there is no aperture of exit. In one case of a gentleman under my care there was only a small opening in the palm of the hand, without any aperture of exit, and there was no great destruction of the bones, except some injury at the articulation of the carpus and metacarpus, but the shot had expanded laterally, tearing up the nerves, tendons, and blood-vessels in the palm, and so necessitated amputation. In all cases of gunshot wounds we must consi- der the degree and kind of force causing the injury, when estimating the danger of the Vv^ound and its effects, and consi- dering the question of amputation. Wounds from the bursting of firearms are met with very frequently in the hand and wrist, and often require amputation to be performed. But we are not to assume that there is any- thing peculiar in the nature of the injury itself which necessi- tates amputation ; it is required simply on account of the nature of the parts injured; the joints being opened into, or the great vessels destroyed. But in many cases the bursting of a firearm or the explosion of a powder-flask does not cause

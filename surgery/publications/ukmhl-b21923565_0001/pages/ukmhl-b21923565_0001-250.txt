LECTUEE XXXII. Gunshot Injuries of Bones and Joints—Effects produced by a Ball on the Denser Portions of Bone, as compared with those produced on the Cancellated Texture—Special Risks attending on Injuries of Joints—Views of Dupuytren and Henuen regarding their Treatment—Excision v. Amputation—Special Advantages of Primary Excision—Statistics—General Kules for Amputation when necessary. By this time you will have learned that the injuries of which we have been speaking are very much modified or aggravated, not only by the nature, force, and direction of the missile em- ployed, but also by the quality of the texture against which it strikes. And nowhere do we find this better exemplified than in connection with— Gunshot Injueies of Bones and Joints.—When a ball strikes the dense part of a bone it produces very different and much more destructive results, than when the softer or cancellated texture is struck. A ball striking the dense shaft of a bone breaks it into pieces, but it does not break up the cancellated texture in the same way—it sinks into it, on account of the texture offering less resistance. When a ball strikes along the surface of a bone like the ilium, it forms a deep rut in it; but when the ball strikes the shaft of a bone, it shatters the whole bone, not merely where it strikes, but the whole bone is broken up, fissures extend- ing both longitudinally and transversely. When a brdlet passes through the softer part of a bone like the tibia, it may form a rut in it, and leave a rounded opening like that made by a bullet in a flesh wound. When a somewhat spent ball strikes a bone, it leaves an aperture of entrance with the edges depressed ; but the aperture of exit is different—there the bone is broken up by the force of the passing ball. The effects produced are—that the vitality of the bone is completely destroyed, blood is effused

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. XV WOUNDS.—Plate X.—Page 232. Fig. 1. A patient in the condition termed Opisthotonos. (From a sketch by the late Sir Charles Bell. The finished oil-painting is in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons.) Fig. 2. Diagram of the tepid bath treatment of lacerated or gun-shot wounds, or compound fractures ; described in Lecture xxix. pp. 192, 193. Fig. 3. A case of tetanus, lately in the Eoyal Infirmary. It illustrates the peculiar expression of the features, and rigid contraction of the hand and arm, whilst the contracted state of the eyelids will correct the impression made by the widely-open eye in Sir C. Bell's sketch, as that condition is unusual. (From a sketch by Dr. John Smith.)

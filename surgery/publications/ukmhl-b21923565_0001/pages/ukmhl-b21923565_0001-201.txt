TREA TMENT. 167 most can only be required as an alterative to use with the iodide of potassium, which by itself is usually sufficient; but sometimes when the disease does not yield to the iodide of potass the mer- cury may be given, taking care of course not to push it too far. Mercury is apt to produce diseases very similar to those met with in the more advanced stages of syphilis, and hence there is always some risk in using it, and its effects in each case require to be carefully watched. When we do use the mercury, the best preparation to use is the iodide of mercury. The decoction of sarsaparilla may be given after the iodide of potassium, but I have no faith in it, though Mr. Lawrence— whose lectures on syphilis are well worth consulting—values it highly. When the eruption is beginning to fade, the use of a bath containing a little bicarbonate of soda is very beneficial; after a time add a little sulphur, but do not make the bath too stimulating. In some, cases we require to use the weak nitro- muriatic acid bath. The same acid given internally is also often of great service. In the treatment of the scaly eruption, I would always begin Avitli the iodide of potassium, as in some cases, when given in large doses, it effects a cure of the disease ; but at the same time it cannot be altogether trusted to, and therefore it must be com- bined with some alterative form of mercurial; and we find that in this form of disease even anti-mercurialists give a little mer- cury, but here, as elsewhere, its effects must be carefully watched, never aHowing it to produce extreme salivation, and never giving either it or the iodide of potassium during the stage of febrile excitement, but only when the desquamation is taking place.

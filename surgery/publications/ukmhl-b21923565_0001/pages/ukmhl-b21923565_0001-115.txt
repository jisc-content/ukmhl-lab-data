Erysipelas is a peculiar inflammation of the cutaneous struc- ture. It is a disease the knowledge of which is of great importance to the surgeon, for in certain states of the constitution, and under certain circumstances, as when it j^i'evails epidemically, we find it thwarting his best-designed operations, and converting the most trifling into serious injuries. Erysipelas may attack any part of the surface, and the general appearances and cha- racters of the inflammatory action and its termination are modi- fied by the nature of the part in which it occurs. In those forms of the disease where the inflammation is limited to the skin, it is characterised by bright I'edness of a lake tinge. This redness is not circumscribed but diffuse, the colour gradually fading into that of the surrounding skin. On pressing the part with the point of the finger, it becomes pale, the cutaneous capillaries being for the moment emptied by the pressure, but as soon as that is withdrawn they immediately refill, and the redness again returns. There is little or no tension in the part, and the pain is of an itching and burning character. As the capillaries cannot relieve themselves by effusion into the skin tissue, the serum is exuded between the true skin and cuticle, causing vesications. Where the inflammation of the skin is in the neighbourhood of parts containing much loose cel- lular tissue, into which the vessels can relieve themselves by effusion,—there is often a great amount of infiltration or serous effusion into the cellular structure, and the surface in these cases pits on pressure.

131 TREATMENT OF CARCINOMA. treatment, removing tlie affected glands as well as the tumour. There are, liowever, certain cases in which we ought not to operate, as when the lymphatics are very much affected, or where there is an undefined tail-like projection creeping up from the breast to- wards the axilla. In cases of cancer where the skin is affected— red and brawn-like or tubercular—we can have no true definition even of the local disease ; I consider that in such cases operation is unwarrantable. In any case of cancer when the pulse is per- sistently high, above 100, the prognosis is unfavourable, as a low form of erysipelas is almost sure to supervene after the operation. A new treatment has lately been proposed in cases of cancer —namely, the sub-cutaneous injection of weak acetic acid into the tumour. The principle of this is so far correct, and was suggested long ago by Professor Bennett, who showed that the cells of cancer- ous matter disappeared under the use of certain re-agents—among them being acetic acid—and were formed into a sort of amor- phous matter. In cases of hard cancer not admitting of exci- sion the injection of the acetic acid is well worthy of a trial, though as yet it has not often been employed, nor with much advantaGfe.

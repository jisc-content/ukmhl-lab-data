SYPHILIS. 170 after the removal, witli a little sulphate of copper; although there is not much fear of the cut surface taking on the diseased I action. Another condition met with, both in the primary and second- ary stages of syphilis, is one which may also occur as a con- genital affectionâ€”Phymosis. When it exists along with, or is consequent upon a chancre, it is very troublesome to deal with, though, if it be seen in the early stage, and if there be no con- genital phymosis, it can generally be got rid of readily ; but in many cases the part beyond is swollen, and often there are a number of sores existing within the prepuce, and, if left to itself, the unhealthy discharges are confined, and the diseased action often destroys the prepuce, though at other times the con- dition may pass off without treatment. When the phymosis is so decided as not to allow of the prepuce being drawn back, the best treatment is to introduce a director beneath the prepuce, close to the side of the frteuum, and with a bistoury slit up the prepuce to its whole extent. When this is done, we see the position, extent, and number of the sores, if the condition have existed for some time; and if there be a large sore on the prepuce, or if a number of small chancres be present, the best treatment is to circumcise the patient, by cutting off the prepuce higher up with a pair of scissors. One objection made to this plan of treatment is, that the cut surface left is apt to take on a chancrous action ; but the same objection applies to the slit made in cutting open the prepuce, which is a necessary operation, and the risk of bad results after the circumcision, is not much greater than if the prepuce had only been slit up. After removing the prepuce, we may touch the surface with nitrate of silver, to prevent the unhealthy action taking place ; but that is sometimes a^Dt to irritate the parts. After circumcision there is usually a good deal of bleeding, and we require to tie some of the larger vessels, and then apply cold-water dressings to repress it, and afterwards treat the chancres in the usual way. If there be a chancre situated near the fra^uum, which does not heal readily at the first, but

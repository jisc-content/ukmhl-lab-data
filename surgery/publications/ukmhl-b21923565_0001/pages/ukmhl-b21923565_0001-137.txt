LECTURE XVII. Definition of Tumour-growth—Distinction between Tumours and Hyisertroplaies ; between Inflammatory Swelling and Tumour-growth — Classification of Tumours : their separation into the two great divisions of Simple and Malig- nant—Simple Tumours: their vital manifestations, structural peculiarities, diagnosis, and history—Malignant Tumours : tlieir characters, etc. - !From the study of inflammation, and those diseases which are more closely associated with it, we now pass on to the considera- tion of the subject of morbid nutrition, as it is exhibited in TUMOUE-GEOWTH. In its Ordinary acceptation, the word tumour means a preternatural swelling of any kind. In surgical patho- logy it has a special signification, and is understood to denote " An overgrowth resulting from morbid or abnormal nutrition, which, instead of merely supplying new material sufficient to repair waste of tissue, yields a redundancy, thereby leading to over- growth, with more or less alteration of structure and form." But this definition is not sufficiently exact. A true tumour has other characteristics besides those mentioned. The substance thrown out is not merely ordinary plastic material in excess, as in inflammatory swelling, where there seems to be merely a deposit of new matter into the texture ; but, in a true tumour, the material exuded by the capillaries of the part has in itself a peculiar innate power of attraction and selection whereby it can reproduce a texture peculiar to itself, but different from the natural tissue in which it grows ; while, in ordinary nutrition, the material is either assimilated to the textures to which it is sup- plied, or gradually removed by absorption. The increase in tumours is dependent on the surrounding tissues for little more than the vascular supply, which increases with the size of the tumour.

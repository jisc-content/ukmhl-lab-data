94 ERYSIPELAS. antimony. Some recommend that antimonials should be com- bined with salines, but such a combination is objectionable— first, on account of the disagreeable taste, which causes the patient to take it reluctantly and irregularly; and, second, because the diaphoretic action of the mixture may be checked and interfered with by the exposure to cold which its purgative action necessi- tates. If antimony does not answer, or if there be gastric irrita- tion or diarrhoea, I would recommend you to substitute ipecacuan in combination with morphia. Indeed, wherever there is great constitutional irritation, opium—unless contraindicated by its effects in regard to head symptoms—is a most useful remedy either alone or combined with antimony or ipecacuanha, but it should never be given until after the bowels have been well opened, nor when there are violent head symptoms with tendency to coma. In the latter stages of phlegmonous erysipelas, where diffuse abscesses have been opened and sloughs are being separ- ated, opium is of great value to allay irritation, support strength, and procure sleep. Though in phlegmonous erysipelas the treatment is at first antiphlogistic, both locally and constitutionally, yet as the disease goes on, especially when the sloughs are separating, we must support the patieiit's strength by stimulants and nutrient diet. In oedematous erysipelas, on the other hand, the treatment should not be antiphlogistic ; the limb should be bandaged from the foot or hand upwards, so as to give it support, friction with the hand to favour the returning circulation as far as possible, and the use of diuretics and alteratives to act on the kidneys, skin, and bowels, and assist the elimination of the fluids from the body, followed by the use of iron in moderate doses. From the amount of oedema and tension, it is necessary sometimes to make punctures in the part, but they are apt to take on a slough- ing action ; a slow form of ulceration takes place, which often proves fatal. It is a condition indicating low vital power, and is rather a symptom than a disease, and therefore punctures should not be made except in extreme cases, where the tension

EI^YSIPELAS. 92 underlying the skin, it may terminate in suppuration. Cir- cumscribed abscess in erysipelas is by no means a rare termination, altliougli it lias been stated that it seldom or never occurs. I have seen it take place in the scalp, eyelids, hand, and arm, and it is not unfrequent in the lower extremities. Very generally, however, the collections of matter are more diffuse, owing to the want of a tendency to plastic exudation in the dis- ease. In phlegmonous erysipelas the pus is thin, acrid, and of an unhealthy sanious character. It becomes extensively infil- trated throughout the cellular tissue of the part, dissecting the muscles, and separating the adjacent textures, in which it often leads to sloughing. During suppuration the overlying integuments assume a dark brownish colour, and impart to the touch a feeling of soft boggy fluctuation. This condition has received the name of cellular infiltration ; it is rather diffuse infiltrated suppuration, the result of phlegmonous erysipelas. Prognosis in this disease must be based upon the constitu- tional condition and symptoms. It must be in all cases very guarded, for the most serious cases are often trifling and slight in their primary manifestations. It must be regulated partly by the history of the patient's previous habits as regards in- temperance, and by his present state as regards age and debility, together with the character of the attack—whether acute or typhoid—its symptoms, and its site. In cases where the dis- ease is situated on the head, and attended with great cerebral excitement; or in the air-passages, and attended with dyspncea ; or when it attacks the surface of the abdomen, and dysenteric symptoms supervene, the danger is very great. So it is also in all cases of extensive phlegmonous erysipelas, especially when attended with sloughing and discharge. Finally, in any case, if the pulse keeps high—above 100 for more than ten days—the prognosis is unfavourable.

LECTURE XXV. Secondary Sypliilis—Bubo, Acute and Chronic—Syphilitic Sore Throat—Syphi- litic Affections of the Skin—Papular, Pustular, Squamous, and Vesicular— Their Treatment. Secondary Syphilis.—The secondary symptoms of syphilis in- clude the different forms of skin eruptions and diseases, accom- panied by some febrile action ; certain local conditions, such as bubo, phymosis or paraphymosis—the two latter may also accom- pany the primary sore—the syphilitic sore throat, the various syphilitic warts, condylomata, and fissures. The skin diseases are generally spoken of first, but as a rule the bubo takes place before the skin eruptions. The Bubo is one of the local conditions; it is secondary to the primary sore on the penis, but occurs almost simultaneously with it, and sometimes occurs as a special form (bubon d'emblee) in the first instance before the appearance of the sore on the penis. Thus, when there has been no sore on the penis, but where a bubo has existed, we sometimes have the secondary symptoms appearing after the usual interval, but this form of bubo is exceedingly rare, and some even deny its exist- ence altogether. I have seen at least two well-marked cases of patients admitted with suppurative bubo, without any sore, in whom chancre appeared on the penis eight or ten days after being in hospital. This form of bubo arises apparently from absorption of the virus from the surface of the mucous lining of the prepuce or glans penis, and the constitution becoming affected in con- sequence. The ordinary bubo is simply a glandular abscess occurring in consequence of the irritation produced by the sore on the penis, and also in consequence of the poison being con- veyed by the lymphatics from the part affected. In a case of ordinary gonorrhoea it is very common to find several glands in

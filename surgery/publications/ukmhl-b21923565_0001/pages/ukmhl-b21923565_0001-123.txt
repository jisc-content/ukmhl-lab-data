The Treatment should, as a general rule, be antiphlogistic, but with certain reservations ; thus we must modify our antiphlogistic treatment according to the circumstances of the individual case, according as the action is sthenic or asthenic. We must also keep in view that when erysipelas prevails as an epidemic, its type often varies considerably from that of the epidemic which immediately preceded it. Thus, in some epidemics, we find that antiphlogistic treatment can be carried out actively and with success; while in others the slightest amount of depletion proves hurtful, and the disease rapidly assumes a typhoid character. The general indications of treatment are to diminish inflam- matory action when violent and well marked, and to allay irritation and febrile excitement. In young robust patients, where the constitution has not been impaired by dissolute habits, and where the febrile symptoms are violent, and assume the sthenic or inflammatory type, general bloodletting may be had recourse to ; but it is seldom that such treatment is indicated in this disease, and in the severer forms, where the surface is very much inflamed, the local depletion from incisions will be found in a great measure to supersede it. In the majority of cases the constitutional treatment should consist of clearing oirt the stomach and bowels by the adminis- tration of emetics and purgatives. The best purgatives to use are mercurials followed by salines. The circulation should be lowered and diaphoresis favoured by minute nauseating doses of

LECTURE XXII. Simple Tumours of Boue : their similarity to those of the soft parts—Exostosis ; its structure, character, and treatment—Enchondroma: its appearance and limitation to the part in which it occurs—Osteosarcoma : its gi-eat resemblance to ordinary fibrous tumours—Case—Osteocystoma ; analogous in its nature and progress to the ordinary fibro-cystic tumours ; treatment—Osteoma. As I have already fully discussed the subject of tumour-growth in general, and also the characters of the principal special tumours of the soft parts, it is unnecessary to do more in regard to Tumours of Bone than direct your attention briefly to some of their peculiarities. Tumour-growth in the osseous is the same as in the softer textures, only modified by the greater resistance and hardness of the structure in which it occurs. The peculiar mode of nutrition and development of bone, causes tumour-growth in it to be slower, and to have a greater degree of anatomical limitation. Again, as regards the special tumours of bone, each of these has its analogue amongst the tumours of the soft parts, whether in the simple or malignant groups. And in some instances, as that of medullary cancer of bone, the disease is not only analogous to, but very generally identical in structure and character with, the similar disease arising in the soft textures. Exostosis is an osseous tumour corresponding to the vas- cular sarcoma. In the femur, humerus, and other bones, we meet with a tumour growing slowly, and perhaps not attracting much attention at first, being only troublesome from its inter- ference with the action of the muscles of the limb. It grows from the bone, but, like a true tumour, not in the form of the bone, but as an outgrowth connected to it by a narrow pedicle. ' The structure of exostosis is simply that of boue, with Haversian canals in its interior. Its surface is rounded towards the deep aspect of the muscles, and sometimes coA'cred with a

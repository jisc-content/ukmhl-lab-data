LECTURE XXX. Gunsliot Wounds : Their Special Cliaraeteristics—Circumstances whicli regulate the Extent of Destruction attending them—Their Frequent Deviations from a Straight Course—Wounds inflicted by Small Shot : by Wadding—Superficial Injuries. Next in the catalogue of solutions of continuity comes the group of injuries which is embraced in the class of Gunshot Wounds. Under this head I shall discuss injuries inflicted by the dis- charge or bursting of fire-arms, or by the explosion of gunpowder. They differ rather in degree than in kind from other wounds, and are generally complicated by the lodgment of balls, or frag- ments of other foreign bodies. The wound inflicted in the soft parts in some degree re- sembles a punctured wound, inasmuch as the superficial or external opening is less extensive than the deeper portions. The parts surrounding its course are not so much cut as con- tused, twisted, and torn ; but all the peculiar unfavourable conditions attending punctured wounds are not only present, but much magnified. For the degree of force with which the bullet is projected is such as to sever the textures with far greater violence, and to impair their vitality to a much greater extent. So that, whilst in punctured wounds there may be a fair chance of union by the first intention, in gimshot wounds we can hardly expect any such result; for though there are a few exceptional cases on record of these injuries healing by the first intention, yet such a result cannot be looked for as a rule. A bullet wound may be recognised by the following charac- teristics :—The aperture of entrance is small, rounded, and depressed. It is less in diameter than the bullet which in- flicted it, or the muzzle of the gun or pistol from which it was discharged. The edges are depressed and forced in, and, if the

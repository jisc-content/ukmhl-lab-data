CHRONIC ABSCESS. 29 thought that the pyogenic membrane became inflamed in this way and decomposed, and that this set up the irritative fever. He therefore recommended a small valvular opening; the skin over the abscess was drawn up and the opening made ; the skin was then allowed to retract, and the result was that the openings in the skin and in the deeper parts did not correspond, and so no air could enter the cavity. In my own practice I sometimes use the exhausting syringe, M'hich prevents the entrance of air ; but, at the same time, I believe that the irritative fever which results is due to the decomposition of the contents of the abscess. By making a small opening in it with an ordinary abscess-lancet or trocar, we do not empty the cavity completely, we only draw off the tliin part of the pus; the thick curdy matter—the vitality of which is exceedingly low—is left behind, and this, as well as the blood which is poured out into the cavity after removal of the thinner pus, decomposes; noxious gases, such as sulphuretted hydrogen, are evolved; and I believe that it is to the absorption of these putrid matters, and not to the entrance of the air, that the irritative fever is due; for even when opened in such a way that no air could enter I have seen the cavity of the abscess refill and irrita- tive fever ensue, whilst all the bad symptoms have disappeared on the abscess being laid freely open. I have so frequently seen the best results follow.the free opening of such abscesses, that I cannot but think that where we do open them, a free incision to permit the ready escape of noxious matters is less to be dreaded than the pent-up putrescence which so often follows a small opening. When a chronic abscess is not connected with a joint or internal cavity, it may be opened without much hesitation. The wall of the cavity should then be painted with tincture of iodine, which seems to possess antipyogenic qualities and to induce a healthier action in the part. Sometimes we require to make a counter- opening and introduce some drainage-tubing, to enable us to wash out the cavity and inject appropriate lotions into the abscess. A chronic abscess communicating with a diseased joint is much more dangerous, and it is very doubtfid whether we should open it, as irritative fever, exhausting discharge, with hectic, are

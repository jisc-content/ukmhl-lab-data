TUMOURS OF BONE. 144 tumour of tlie femur wliicli I show you is perhaps the most remarkable specimen of the disease in any museum. The case occurred in the practice of the late Mr. Listen. Formerly the term spina ventosa was applied to these tumours, as well as to expansion of the bone by abscess ; this arose from erroneous notions of the pathology derived from look- ing at dried specimens, such as this. There is a tumour arising from enlargement of the bone itself, termed Osteoma, which is really a form of exostosis. It is chiefly found in the lower jaw ; and when removed by excision has no tendency to return.

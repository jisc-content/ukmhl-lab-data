There are certain otlier local affections besides the sore throat and the bubo whieh accompany the secondary stage of syphilis ; they are sometimes mentioned as tertiary symptoms, but they are most severe during the secondary condition. These are—the different forms of condylomata and warty excrescences ; a pecu- liar form of iritis; certain forms of cracks or fissures occurring in different parts of the body ; affections of the lip and tongue, and a form_ of ulcer met with in the rectum; also syphilitic contraction of the rectum. The Gonchjlomatoas is a very common form of secondary symptom. Sometimes it is considered as a primary symptom, but it is really a secondary condition, and it is not likely to pro- duce a sore like a chancre. There are two forms of syphilitic condyloma : one, the warty condyloma, which is not unlike the ordinary gonorrhoeal wart; the other or more marked syphilitic affection—the mucous condyloma. Both are of frequent occur- rence, the warty condyloma being perhaps the more frequent in the female than in the male, while the mucous condyloma is very common in both sexes. Condylomata are met with, not only on the genital organs, but also near the anus, scrotum, and groin. Very generally the tonsils and throat, sometimes the lips, are also affected. The warty condyloma sometimes assumes a Y villous form of growth, and then closely resembles epithelial ,V.^cancer. The mucous condyloma also often occurs at the edge of the lip, and forms there a fissure, or ulcer with a hard base, which, from the constant movement of the parts, becomes very

EXPLANATION OF PLATES. INFLAMMATION.—Plate I.—Page 2. This plate is intended to illustrate the appearances exhibited in inflam- mation of the eye, in contrast with those seen in its natural condition. See Lecture i. Fig. 1. Acute Co7ijanctivitis. Stage of active congestion. Increased red- ness due to increased vascularity. The vessels of the conjunc- tiva obviously enlarged and arborescent. Fig. 2. Ckemosis. The conjunctiva of. an almost uniform red colour. Swollen, puckered, and pushed forward, owing to the passive congestion or stasis with eft'usion into the membrane and con- nective tissue between it and the sclerotic. Fig. 3. Healthy eye. Fig. 4. Iritis. Deep-seated inflammation of the eye. The appearance of vascularity is modifled liy the dense structure of the sclerotic. The zone round the cornea is due to the anatomical arrangement of the blood-vessels. The phenomenon of exudation is seen in the mass of effused lymph, situated on the pupillary margin of the iris. Fig. 5. Cor ileitis. Showing the modification of the appearances of inflam- mation in a non-vascular structure, there is neither redness nor vascularity in the cornea, but it has become opaque from e.xuda- tion into its structure. See Lecture i. pp. 3-6. SUPPURATION.—Plate IL—Page 22. Fig. 1. Acute diffuse abscess of arm and fore-arm, treated by openings and counter-openings. Drainage-tubes introduced so as to favour escape of discharge, and to facilitate the washing out of the cavity of the abscess. Fig. 2. Acute circumscribed abscess of fore-arm, pointing towards the sur- face. The form of the abscess shows the circumscription of the purulent collection, and the bright red colour shows the acute action in contrast witli that of the chronic aliscess. Fig. 4. Fig. 3. Chronic abscess of hip opened by tlie method dosciibcd at page 30. (Sketched by Dr. John Smith.)

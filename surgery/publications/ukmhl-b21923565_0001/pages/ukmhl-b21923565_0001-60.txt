SUPPURATION. 34 but I suspect that pytemia is not so unfrequent in private practice as is often stated. As regards treatment, our claief aim should be prophylaxis directed to the improvement of the patient's general health before an operation, for we can do very little when pyaemia once sets in. In many cases I have found iron to be very bene- ficial, and also the chlorate of potash, but in exactly parallel cases they have done no good whatever. Good nourishing diet should be given, and special attention paid to the ventilation of the room or ward. When abscesses form near the surface of the body, as they sometimes do in the sub-acute form of pysemia, they must be opened ; and as these cases are generally the most favourable, quinine and various other remedies may be given, but none of them are at all certain in their action. All we can do is to try, by supporting the patient's strength, to let nature have as good a chance as possible of eliminating the poison and effecting a cure.

In Chronic Interstitial Suppuration or Chronic Abscess the symptoms are much. less marked, and proceed more slowly than in the acute abscess. There is little or no pain felt, and the swelling, which is often the first indication of the collec- tion, is colourless. There is no increase in temperature, and hence the name of cold abscess has been given to it as opposed to the acute abscess, where the temperature undergoes a marked increase. The progress of the diseased action is very slow. Constitutional symptoms may or may not be present. On the surface of the abscess we sometimes find swollen veins, as in certain tumours. The pus which flows from a chronic abscess, on its being opened, is of variable character—sometimes of a creamy consistence, very often thin and whey-like, with flaky masses ; but it is never reaUy homogeneous, for there is always some of the flaky matter in the cavity of the abscess. This form of suppuration generally occurs in patients of a strumous or scrofulous diathesis, and is often connected with diseases of bones and joints. The abscess is lined by a peculiar cyst-like membrane, the inner surface of which is villoiis or granular. As this is the source of the pus, it is termed the pyogenic membrane. The diagnosis of chronic abscess is not always easy. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish it from certain tmnours, such as fatty or medullary. In these tumours there is a feeling of elasticity almost amounting to fluctuation, and there are large veins on the surface just as in chronic abscess. In both chronic abscess and medullary sarcoma the patient has a sort of sallow complexion,

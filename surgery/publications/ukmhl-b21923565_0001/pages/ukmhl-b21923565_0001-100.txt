LECTURE XII. Mortification or Gangi-ene : its phenomena, causes, and varieties—Acute or Humid Gangrene generally of traumatic origin : its symptoms and manifestations— Treatment must be regulated according to tlic cause—Question of Amputation in Traximatic Gangrene. Mortification or Gangrene is complete and extensive death of a part. It may result from inflammation, or from injury. As a result of inflammation, it may be due to the amount of the exuda- tion and the rapidity with which it is poured out, interrupting nu- trition by causing pressure on textures, while there is often rupture of some of the congested capillaries or small bloodvessels, leading to extravasation of blood into the cellular tissue. The pressure of this, along with that of the exudation, interferes with the vitality of the part. The.blood, exudation, and surrounding tissues, become disorganised; they undergo decomposition, gases are evolved from them, alteration in colour takes place under the integument. If the skin be not broken, extrication of the gases into the surrounding cellular tissue occurs ; further discoloration takes place ; and the blood-poisoning resulting from these local changes hastens the progress of the constitutional symptoms. Generally we have it in an intense form, when the vitality of the part has been dimi- nished by local causes, such as injury, or the continued applica- tion of cold ; or where the debility arises from some constitutional cause, either in the state of the bloodvessels, or one of a temporary character, such as debility following upon fevers. In such cases, reactionary inflammation or irritation of a part is very apt to be followed by gangrene. Gangrene or mortification is divided into two principal forms ■—the Acute, humid, or traumatic gangrene ; and Chronic, or dry gangTcne. In the acute form the action proceeds very rapidly, and the fluids have not time to pass out of the textures before

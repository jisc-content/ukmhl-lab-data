231 PLASTIC OPERATIONS. The same considerations apply to similar contractions of the limbs of long standing resulting from burns, and in which the muscles are j)robablj altered in structure. But all rules have exceptions. I can conceive of a case in which, by relieving the contraction of the soft parts and excising an anchylosed elbow- joint, a good result might be obtained. In cases in which the soft textures alone are implicated, we should keep in view the original extent of skin destroyed, so as to be able in some measure to calculate the amount required to fill up the gap which will result from the retraction of the skin which had been dragged from neifihbourin" surfaces when we free the contraction. Unless the operator takes this into con- sideration he may find himself very awkwardly placed. In many cases the original extent of lost skin is such as to forbid operation. There are certain conditions favourable to success in these cases, such as a large amount of subcutaneous fat, as its absorp- tion permits of the skin closing in with less subsequent con- traction. The natural laxity of the skin also, in certain regions of the body, such as the abdomen and perineum, permits of the healing process progressing more quickly, and with less con- traction and deformity than in such regions as the scalp or back. Finally, as regards the method of operation. I have already told you that we must not be content with merely dividing the contraction. We must dissect the agglutinated and altered texture of the cicatrix. In most cases we require to transplant skin to fill up the gap, and in doing so we must be careful to keep flaps of sufficient thickness and avoid twisting, dragging, or anything likely to interfere with their vascular supply. There is always a risk of a very large or long flap losing its vitality, either in whole or part, and hence I often prefer two or more smaller flaps of skin, so that their nutrition may be less imperilled.

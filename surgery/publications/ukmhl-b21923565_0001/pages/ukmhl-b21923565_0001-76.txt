LECTUEE VIII. Ulceration continued—Tlie Callous Ulcer : its appearance, progress, and treatment —The second class of Ulcers—Those prevented from healing by excessive action—Tlie Inflamed Ulcer : its characters, causes, and local and constitu- tional treatment. The Callous, Indolent, or Chronic Ulcer, is mucli more common than the weak ulcer. It generally occurs among the poorer classes, and as these patients cannot observe the conditions neces- sary for its cure—namely, rest and proper treatment—it becomes, in their case at least, somewhat intractable ; for often, after it has been so far healed, the patient goes back to work, and the ulcer is reproduced in perhaps a worse form than before. The cha- racters of the callous ulcer are well marked. The sore is gener- ally large and deeply excavated ; its margins are white, rounded, and callous ; its surface presents an' orange or brownish varnished appearance, or is coated by a thin sanious discharge when irritation is- present; it is seldom covered by granulations. The surrounding skin is thickened, hard, and discoloured, generally assuming a purplish or bluish grey tint, and the whole limb usually becomes considerably swollen and deformed, presenting sometimes an appearance not unlike the condition known as elephantiasis. In the weak ulcer there is an appearance of overgrowth; here we have no growth at all—no granulating surface, but the a.ppearance of great destruction of texture. I say the appearance, for in reality the ulcer has not dug deeply, but the thickened margins and swollen textures surrounding it make it appear deep, and this appearance is very characteristic. It is to the thickened and elevated margins and surrounding induration that we must look in order to ascertain the true nature of the sore, for these are conditions which prevent successful repair.

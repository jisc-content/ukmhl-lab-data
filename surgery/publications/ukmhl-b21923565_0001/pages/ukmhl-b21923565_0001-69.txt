Ulceration is another result of inflammatory action. It consists essentially in molecular death of the part. During the process a copious exudation is rapidly thrown out, which does not undergo transformation into permanent texture, but becomes broken down and disintegrated, causing destruction of the parts in which it occurs. The collected matter gives rise first to swelling ; it then points towards the surface by causing small elevations in the more attenuated parts of the superjacent integument or mucous membrane. These at length lose their vitality from the continued pressure of the fluid, and give way ; small openings are then established on their surfaces, and each begins to emit a thin ichorous discharge. The idcers so formed tend to increase in number and dimensions until they gradually coalesce, and at length one large open sore or ulcer becomes established. Such are the stages of the process as it usually occurs in the healthy subject, but ulceration is more apt to take place in patients of an unhealthy constitution, or those in whom the vitality of the tissues generally is below the normal standard. In them, therefore, the plastic lymph, which is thrown out with a view to the reparation of the breaches of continuity, has lower powers of organisation, and the process is proportionally tedious. "When the destructive process has ceased, an effort is made towards repair. This consists in the formation of little bright

LECTURE XX. Malignant Tumours—Brief outline of the varieties of Carcinoma, namely, Scirrhus, Colloid Cancer, and Epithelial Cancer—Characters, Causes, and Symptoms of Carcinoma ; its Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment. Cancer is a generic term including all forms of malignant growth, wliether hard or soft; and is usually characterised by the pre- sence of peculiar proliferous cells, indicating great tendency to rapid growtli. The different forms of Caecixoma are Scirrhus, colloid cancer, and epithelial cancer. The most frequent form is scirrhus or true hard cancer. This growth j^resents a peculiar appearance—a dense white structure, almost like that of a fibrous tumour, but very different in true chara,cter. It apparently contracts the textures and consolidates them, gradually bringing the different parts into closer contact. The white fibrous texture is sometimes arranged in masses, and projections pass off from the central mass to the different parts of tlie organ. This is well seen in scirrhus of the breast. The feelincr on cuttincf through scirrhus is much the same as that experienced in cutting up cartilage partially ossified—the knife passes through it with a crisp grating sound. Another form of carcinoma has the white striated fibrous bands arranged in a peculiar way ; they pass towards the surface, and form as it were septa, with interstices between them. These are filled with a sort of gelatinous matter, like melted glue or jelly, of a pale-yellow or dark-brown colour ; the septa themselves being cancerous matter, and the fluid part also containing the proliferous cancer-cells. This is the colloid or glue-like form of cancer. A third form of carcinoma, the epithelial cancer, is found affecting certain textures, such as the skin and mucous mem- brane, and presents a sort of villous appearance. On examina-

LECTUEE' XVIIL Special Simple Tumours—Simple Vascular Sarcoma : its nature and treatment— The' Adipose or Fatty Tumour : its general characteristics and occasional peculiarities—Adenoid or Glandlike Tumours : their points of resemblance, structure, and history—Fibrous Tumours. In yesterday's lecture, after briefly defining the word tumour, and explaining the difference between tumour-growth and hyper- trophy, I endeavoured to point out to you the distinctive cha- racters of simple and malignant tumours. These I wish you to bear in mind as we proceed further to discuss individually the varieties embraced in each subdivision. The first subdivision includes the special simple tumours, and of these we shall first consider Simple Vascular Sarcoma. This term indicates a tumour of a somewhat fleshy consistence resembling that of the natural tissues, the development of which appears to depend upon the persistent increase of its vascular supply. It is the simplest of all forms of tumour-growth, and very closely re- sembles hypertrophy, only it is an outgrowth different in character and form from the part in which it grows, though re- sembling it in texture. The ordinary polypus is an example ; in structure it very closely resembles the mucous membrane from which it grows, but in form and character it entirely differs from that membrane, inasmuch as it has a narrow pedicle, and projects widely. These polypi seem to be recurrent, but it is not a recurrence of the tumour, because several grow together, and though the larger ones be removed some small ones are left behind, which develope themselves and require removal. The ordinary nasal polypus is one of the simplest forms of tumour. Another form of simple sarcoma consists merely in increased develop meat of the skin, and is foiind chiefly affecting the nose ; it

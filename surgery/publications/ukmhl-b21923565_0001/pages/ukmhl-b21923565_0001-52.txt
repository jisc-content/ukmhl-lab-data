SUPPURATION. 26 effects produced by its pressure. There is no fluctuation, but the finger sinks into the skin, and leaves a dimple ; hence we say there is bogginess or pitting on pressure. The subcutaneous, and even the intermuscular cellular tissue, become infiltrated with pus, and the whole limb assumes a dusky red and swollen aspect. The local symptoms of acute abscess are present, but the accompanying fever is of the irritative type, and the pulse is quick, small, and compressible. In the Treatment of infiltrated suppuration we first apply warm and anodyne fomentations, then make incisions early. Here the pus is infiltrated into the spaces of the cellular or areolar tissue, and one or two incisions are therefore not suffi- cient, we require to make a number of small incisions about an inch or an inch and a half in length, and then the matter oozes out slowly. Dress the part afterwards with warm-water lint and a many-tailed bandage. Sometimes the incisions must be made through the deep fascia to allow pus infiltrated through the intermuscular cellular tissue to escape. Iron and other tonics must be given to keep up the patient's strength, and appropriate nutrient diet should be given \ for sloughing is more apt to occur in this than in any other form of suppuration.

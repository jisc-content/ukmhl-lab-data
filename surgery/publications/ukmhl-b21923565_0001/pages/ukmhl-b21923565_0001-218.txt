Punctured Wounds are inflicted by thrusts, the point of the weapon penetrating, and the blade or body following, and separating the tissues like a wedge, rather than like a cutting instrument. The purest form of punctured wound is that pro- duced when the point of the weapon is sharp, and the blade rounded or blunt. Examples of punctured wounds are those made by the trocar in surgery, or by weapons such as the bayonet, rapier, or pike, where there is little or no cutting of the textures. A wound inflicted by such weapons has the following charac- teristics :—Its depth is greater than its superficial extent. As the parts have been thrust aside rather than evenly divided, there is more or less contusion and ecchymosis, and when the weapon is withdrawn, the elastic skin and dense fascial tex- tures close or contract so as to leave a very small orifice com- pared with the size of the weapon, or with the depth of the wound. If the muscular fibres have been divided, a large deep wound is left, because the muscular fibres retract and gape, while the skin and fascial textures contract. This form of wound will be modified according to the form of the weapon ; it varies according as the breadth of the instru- ment increases from the point, or, as the edge is sharp and the

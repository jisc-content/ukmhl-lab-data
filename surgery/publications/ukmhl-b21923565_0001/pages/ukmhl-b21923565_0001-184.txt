LECTURE XXIV. Syphilis, its meaning and modes of propagation—its division into primary, second- ary, and tertiary—Primary Syjiliilis—outline of the characters, appearances, and symptoms of Hard and Soft Chancres—the treatment of each form. To-day, Gentlemen, we commence the consideration of a form of diseased action of a very peculiar nature, inasmuch as, whilst it originates in the local absorption of animal poison, it not only gives rise to constitutional symptoms, but so affects the gene- ral system as to induce a true diathesis or constitutional taint, which, instead of terminating in the individual, may be trans- mitted to his progeny. I refer to Syphilis.—By the term syphUis we mean a diseased condition induced by the introduction of a peculiar poison—the syphilitic virus—into the system. It arises generally from impure sexual intercourse, and, consequently, most frequently attacks the genital organs ; but is capable of affecting other parts by inoculation, as we see occasionally in medical men getting some of the poison into a cut or scratch on the hand. Again, by direct inoculation with the virus, we can produce the sores in other parts of the body besides the genital organs. The diseased condition is generally attended with constitutional effects, resulting from the primary local sore, and hence we speak of the local and constitutional symptoms of the disease under the heads of primary, secondary, and tertiary syphilis. The primary symptoms are the local primary sores or Chancres, and a certain degree of febrile action which generally accompanies them, varying in degree in different cases. The secondary symptoms are the bubo, the acute syphilitic sore throat, the different forms of skin eruptions, syphilitic iritis, condylomata, and warts. The tertiary symptoms include all the more chronic and formid- able effects induced in the constitution by the original primary

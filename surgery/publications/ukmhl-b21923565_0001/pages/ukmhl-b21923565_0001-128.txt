ERYSIPELAS. 98 occasionally it does so ; but in tlie majority of cases the disease will spread beyond tlie line of the nitrate of silver. Blisters have been applied to the limb for the same purpose, and by them too we sometimes succeed in arresting the spread of the disease. The principle is correct in both casesâ€”namely, to get rid of the diffuse, inflammation which is characteristic of erysipelas, and substitute a more healthy form of inflammation with plastic exudation which may limit the local action. But we cannot be sure of exciting this more healthy action either by blistering or by nitrate of silver ; and the parts to which they are applied are not unlikely to assume an erysipelatous or even sloughy character. Before leaving this subject, I would repeat the caution that during convalescence from an attack of erysipelas, great care should be taken. The circulation is always impaired during the progress of the disease, and continues so in many cases throughout a long period of convalescence. This state is sometimes attended with a risk of fatal syncope. The patient should there- fore be kept at rest and very quiet for some time after the violence of the disease has passed away.

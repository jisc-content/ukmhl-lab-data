LECTUEE XIX. Cystic Sarcoma—Eucysted Tumours or Wens—Erectile Tumours or Naevi. Another form of tumour which may be considered as a 'modification of the fibrous tumour is the Cystic Sarcoma. In fibrous and adenoid tumours we have seen that in the fib- rous stritcture of the tumour there are interstices containing fluid. In many cases these form regular cysts, and sometimes the cystic portion of the tumour develops itself at the expense of the solid part, which then becomes compressed, and forms as it were septa between the cysts. In this way the multilocular or cystic sarcoma, of which this tumour of the testicle is a very perfect specimen, seems to be produced. In the interior of these cells or cysts we find a thin glairy fluid. They used to be called hydatid tumours, but are not so in reabty. In the ordinary fibrous tumour we may have a large cyst occupying the centre. This happens from absorption of the septa and a number of sniall cysts uniting to form one large one. If this goes on, a condensed layer, formed by the fibrous stroma of the titmour, will be produced outside, forming a sort of sac. In this fibro- cartilaginous tumour the same cystic conditions may be seen. In some of the hypertrophies cystic formations may take place as in the thyroid body, where there is at first simple enlargement; then part of it forms into a cyst, producing a fluid swelling of part, and giving rise to what is called hydrocele of the thyroid or cystic bronchocele. The fibro-cystic tumour, then, may be regarded as merely a modification of the fibrous tumour, becoming cystic at different points, and sometimes even resulting in a single cyst. The Treatment is the same—namely, complete removal of the cumour. In certain positions where we cannot do this, or when there is a moderate-sized tumour containing fluid, as in hydro- tele in the neck, it is possible to destroy the tumour by drawing off the fluid, and then injecting iodine into it ; but this method

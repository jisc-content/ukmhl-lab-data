MORTIFICA TION. 86 chance of recovery is given by early amputation. In tliis case amputate very wide of the gangrene. Aili. In chronic gangrene, arising from constitutional causes of a temporary character, wait till the general health is re-esta- blished and a line of demarcation thoroughly formed, and then amputate higher up to make a good stump. hth. In gangrene resulting from cold the same rule applies. Wi. In gangrene resulting from constitutional causes of a per- sistent character, do not amputate at all—let nature form the stump—do no more than snip through dead tendon or ligament. ^tli. In gangrene after ligature of the main vessel of a limb, if the gangrene be decided and is spreading, amputate at once. If the superficial femoral artery has been tied, amputate at the lower third of the thigh, for the branches of the profunda and their anastomoses are quite sufficient to nourish the parts form- ing the stump.

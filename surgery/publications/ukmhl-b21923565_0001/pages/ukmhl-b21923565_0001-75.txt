THE WEAK ULCER. 49 The treatment consists in endeavouring to invigorate the part and the system generally. We destroy the unhealthy surface of the sore in order to establish in its place a more healthy process of granulation. This we do by painting over the surface lightly with soKd nitrate of silver, and afterwards applying lint dipped in warm water, or moistened with a slightly-stimulating lotion, such as a solution of sulphate of zinc, 1 or 2 grs. to the oz. of water ; or a weak solution of chlorinated soda. Then we place the part at rest, give local support by means of methodical bandaging, in order to remedy or prevent oedema, or congestion of the limb ; and, in addition to all this, we endeavour to support the constitution by the administration of sixitable nourishment, and stimulants if necessary. In cases of severe burns and scalds, we must be prepared to receive a check every now and then in the healing process. The structure of the ulcer and the texture beyond has undergone consolidation, and had its vitality im- paired ; but, generally speaking, by the treatment I have indi- cated, you will at length succeed in effecting a cure. The form of local stimulus should be changed from time to time ; say from chlorinated soda to sulphate of zinc or sulphate of copper, of the strength of 1 or 2 grs. to the oz., or black-wash, which consists of 4 or 5 grs. of calomel added to the oz. of lime-water.

7 THEORIES. the normal state of affairs the small corpuscles passed through the small capillaries, and the large corpuscles through capillaries of corresponding size. Ijoerhaave supposed that stagnation was produced by a large corpuscle getting by mistake into a small vessel, blocking it up, and so producing obstruction; hence his famous theory entitled "error loci" â€” a theory which held its ground till improved microscopes showed that no such divisions of corpuscles exist, and that the smallest capillary will allow the largest corpuscle to pa^s through it. Thus the assumed anatomical fact was found to be an error, and this shoidd teach us to be very guarded when we speak of facts. CuUen tried to explain the stagnation as due to a supposed " spasni of the extreme vessels, leading to irregular circulation." Sir Charles Bell, however, long ago pointed out that whatever either irritated or impaired the vitality of the vascular wall tended to arrest the flow of the blood, even in the larger vessels. Hence in the irritated condition of the extravascular texture, we find a ready explanation of the phenomenon of stasis. We now merely notice the remote causes of inflammation. These are either predisposing or exciting ; among the former are epidemic and endemic influences, and certain conditions of the constitution, such as scrofula, plethora, and exhaustion. Among the direct exciting causes are any imnatural stimulus, such as a puncture or sting, the application of acrid substances, wounds, exposure to heat or cold, and the like.

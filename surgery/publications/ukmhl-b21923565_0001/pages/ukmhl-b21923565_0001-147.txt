CHARACTERS OF MALIGNANCY. 115 by the cartilage of incrustation, bnt it can never be absolutely limited in the living body, as the blood supplying it circulates ; and hence even in such cases the muscles near the tumour very generally show altered structure by the presence of proliferous cells. 2d. The tendency to ulceration from softening and rapid de- struction of superimposed parts which have been involved in the disease. This is to be distinguished from the ulceration occa- sionally occurring in large simple growths, where the textures have ulcerated from mere mechanical pressure, or in consequence of local irritation. In malignant ulcerations, the fungating open surface is a part of the disease, and the margins of the sore—sup- posing, as sometimes happens, that the original growth were to slough out— would not heal, but would continue to propagate the diseased action. " The margins of a cancerous ulcer are them- selves cancerous." In simple ulceration, on the other hand, the exudation merely impairs vitality or impedes contraction ; and when a simple tumour which has ulcerated is removed or sloughs out, the margins regain their healthy condition, contract, and take on a kindly healing action. 3d. The tendency of malignant growths is to propagate similar formations, either by involving other textures directly, or through the media of the lymphatics, by which the neighbour- ing glands and their related structures are implicated in the diseased action. And finally, they are characterised by their great tendency to return after removal, either in the part from which they were removed, or in some other region of the body.

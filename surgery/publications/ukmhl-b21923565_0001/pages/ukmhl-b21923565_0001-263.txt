LECTURE XXXIII. Burns and Scalds—The Conditions which regulate their Severity, as regards the Constitution of the Patient, the Temperature of the liquid or Metal, and the Site of the Injury—The Comparative Severity of Burns and Scalds—Shock— The more remote Constitutional Effects of these Injuries, as Congestion of the Lungs and Kidneys—Treatment—Amputation—General Remarks on Opera- tions ;for Removal of Deformities. There are very few injuries which have received more attention than Burns and Scalds, and in few liave so many remedies been proposed. This class of injuries is divided into two forms : Scalds, or injuries inflicted by hot liquids ; and Burns, which are inflicted by fire or by hot metal. In estimating the severity of a burn or scald we must take into account several conditions ; and it is perhaps more diflBcult to form a correct estimate in these injuries than in any other. In all other injuries there is a limited force causing them. Here, the effects depend on the radiation of the heat, and the length of time that the part has been exposed to it. One condition should never be forgotten ; and it is this, that the general health of the patient, prior to the injury, has a most important bearing on the resxilt; more so, perhaps, than in any other injury. In burns it makes a great difference as regards the healing process, and as regards operations afterwards, whether the part burned has a large amount of fat under the integument or not. In scalds, we must take into account the nature of the boiling liquid—whether it be water, or oil, or a liquid which retains the temperature longer, and which requires a higher heat than 212° r. for its boiling point. Also whether the liquid contains some peculiar substance in solution, and so possesses acrid quali- ties besides the mere heat. All these conditions must be taken

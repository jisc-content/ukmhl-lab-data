The Phagedenic or Sloughing Ulcer is characterised by the rapidly destructive nature of the process, and forms the con- necting link, as it were, between ulceration and mortification, so that it is sometimes spoken of as ulceration, at others as gangrene, as in the case of Hospital Sore or Hospital Gangrene. , Phagedenic ulceration presents itself under two forms, both equally dangerous, but differing in their local and constitutional symptoms. The more acute form, the Black Phaged^ena, shows itself by the appearance of small vesications, containing a very dark serum, on the margins of some existing sore or wound ; or by some of the granulations in the centre suddenly becoming of a deep purple or black colour, and by the purulent secretion from the surface becoming foetid, altered in appearance, or alto- gether arrested. From the parts first affected by the dark vesication or black spot, the action quickly spreads, the edges of the sore become black or purple and slightly everted, the neighbouring integuments assume a dark dusky red hue, without any circumscription, and become either tense and glazed, or else the swelling is soft, boggy, and diffuse. The granulating sur- face becomes affected and assumes the appearance of an ash- coloured or greenish, occasionally dark brownish-purple or black slough. The margins give way, enlarging the ulcer with extreme rapidity, and the black edges involve the neigh- bouring skin in the diseased action, so that in a few howr^

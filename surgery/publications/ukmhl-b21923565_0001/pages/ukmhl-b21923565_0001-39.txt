General depletion, or blood-letting, may be effected by opening either a vein or an artery, and these two modes are respectively named venesection and arteriotomy. Venesection is the operation more generally practised ; and the vein usually selected is one or other of those situated at the bend of the arm, or the external jugular. Of the veins at the bend of the arm, we prefer to open either the median basilic or the median cephalic, for these are not only larger in size, but are more fixed in position than are the lateral basilic and cephalic. If a vein be not fixed in its place it is liable to roll about under the skin; and should this displacement occur during the operation, blood would escape into the cellular tissue, and there become formed into a sanguineous tumour or thrombus. In selecting a vein on which to operate, it is also necessary to bear in mind its anatomical relations to the artery, otherwise both may be wounded. The median basilic vein overlies the brachial artery at the bend of the arm ; and although more superficial, and separated from the artery by a strong aponeurosis, yet if the operation be performed carelessly, or if the patient give a sudden start, the lancet may penetrate the fascia and the artery beyond. For this reason, I generally prefer to open the median cephalic, it being separated from the -

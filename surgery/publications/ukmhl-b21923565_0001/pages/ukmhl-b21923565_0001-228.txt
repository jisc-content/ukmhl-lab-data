' In my present lecture I proceed to point out to you the Treat- ment of lacerated wounds. From tlie nature of the injury we can very seldom expect these wounds to heal by the first intention. There are cer- tain dangers attending them, such as sloughing, suppuration, and secondary hemorrhage, all of which are unfavourable to this result. There is also the risk of tetanus supervening in consequence of the torn state of the nerves. These are apt to inflame and give rise to irritation along their course, and so to affect the nervous centres. There is always, in large lacerated wounds, a certainty of partial sloughing at least, and great suppuration from the injured textures, and a long time must therefore elapse before such wounds can heal. In a lacerated wound, say of the hand, which does not necessitate am- putation, the best j)lan of treatment is to apply heat and moist- ure, either by placing the part in soft poultices when the injury is slight, or by dressing it frequently with lint soaked in warm water, either simple or slightly medicated with Condy's fluid. We thus endeavour to allay irritation and favour the suppurative process taking place in its healthiest form. Anodynes are given to procure rest, and antimony or aconite to allay the feverish state of the constitution. There is another method of applying heat and moisture to the part, which, in severe cases, is very beneficial It con- sists in placing the limb in a tepid bath by means of a suit-

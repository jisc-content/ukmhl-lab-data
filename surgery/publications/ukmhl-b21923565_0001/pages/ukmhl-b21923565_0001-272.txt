LECTURE XXXIV. Tetanus, a Result of Wounds and Injuries—Time of its Invasion—Symptoms— Pathology—Treatment. Having now considered the various forms of wounds and their treatment, we come to examine the nature of Tetanus, one of their most formidable consequences. This disease is evidently one commencing in the nervous system, affecting the muscles secondarily, and is characterised by violent and persistent, or at least long-continued, contractions of the muscular system. Although most frequently the result of injury, it occasionally occurs without obvious cause, and hence it is classified under the heads of Traumatic and Idiopathic Tetanus. It is with the former that we, as surgeons, have principally to do. Traumatic tetanus may result from any injury; for although it is most likely to follow laceration, or when nerves are injured in punctured wounds ; it occasionally occurs after an incised wound or a trifling abrasion, especially in warm climates and during the rainy season. In this country tetanus generally occurs in spring or at the end of autumn, when the weather is wet and changeable. In cases of traumatic tetanus the symptoms rarely appear immediately after the injury ; generally from eight to ten days afterwards ; sometimes, when the healing process is nearly completed. One of the worst cases of tetanus I have seen com- menced in this way : The patient had suffered from a burn on the arm, for which he attended my ward at the Infirmary as an out-patient. Some time afterwards, when the burn was almost cicatrised, he was seized with tetanus. He was taken into hos- pital, and treated in the manner presently to be described, and, I am happy to say, recovered. There is usually a short pre-

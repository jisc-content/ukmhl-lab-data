20 INFLAMMA TION. into the adipose tissue, or it will project through the openings and plvig them. After the incisions are made, the cupping-glass previously heated should be held over the scarified part, with the one edge resting on the skin, and the other raised about an inch and a-half from it; a spirit flame is then held for a second or two within the raised edge of the glass, and when withdrawn, the glass pressed firmly on the skin, so as to prevent the entrance of cold air. The glass must not be exhausted too much, or the pressure exerted by the rim against the skin will prevent the blood from 'flowing towards the incisions. The quantity of blood drawn must always be regulated \)j the circumstances of the individual case, and the degree to which the circulation is affected by the operation. You have now to learn how to remove the glass when it is sufficiently filled, and this apparently simple proceeding requires the exercise of tact and neatness, otherwise the blood will be spilt, and cause unnecesary trouble. You should place a folded towel just below the under edge of the glass. Then insinuate the nail of your fore-finger beneath the upper edge of the glass to loosen it, while, with the other hand, you hold the lower part of its rim pressed against the skin, so that the blood necessarily falls into the cup without being spilt, being directed towards it by a sponge used by your free hand. After emptying the glass it can be re-applied, if ne- cessary. But as all these operations can be more easily demonstrated than described, I shall now proceed to show you the different steps of the process on the dead body before us. After sufficient blood has been drawn, the wounds should be closed with adhesive plaster.

The term Furunculus or Boil is applied to a diseased condition affecting the true skin, and sometimes the cellular tissue underneath. It assumes the character of a firm circum- scribed inflammatory tumour, of a deep red colour, and conical form. It is attended with acute throbbing pain, and a sensation of itching, burning heat, together with great irritation of the surrounding parts, and constitutional disturbance. At the base the swelling presents a considerable degree of hardness, and there the colour assumes a lake tinge. This colour gradually shades off towards the apex where some whitish or yellowish- looking matter may be seen shining through the wasted integument. The matter is only an imperfect kind of pus, and its evacuation gives little or no relief; often, indeed, the reverse, on account of the irritation set up by the interference. It consists really of portions of broken-down cellular tissue mixed up with sloughy unhealthy pus. Boils vary in size from that of a large pea to that of a walniit. They may appear singly or in groups ; but if singly they are apt to follow each other in very rapid succession. They may be situated in any part of the body, but they are said chiefly to affect the fore part of the body, more particularly the face, neck, and armpits. Doubtless they do often occur on these parts ; but it is by no means unusual to find them in localities the very opposite of these, as on the back, nates, and thighs.

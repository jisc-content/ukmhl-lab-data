The febrile symptoms which I have already described to you as those which accompany acute inflammation of a sthenic type, constitute what is termed inflammatory or symptomatic fever. A variety of this fever, termed Irritative, is met with in erysipelas, and in connection with inflammation in certain constitutions and conditions.

The Terminations of inflammation are various ; it may end in resolution—fibrous formation—pulpiness—friability or consoli- dation of texture—suppuration—ulceration—gangrene or slough- ing.

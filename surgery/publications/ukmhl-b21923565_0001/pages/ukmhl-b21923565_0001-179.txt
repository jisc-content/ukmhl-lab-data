LECTURE XXIII. Malignant Tumours of Bone and their Analogues in the other Textures—Their Symptoms and Effects, Local and Constitutional—Tlie Parts most lialile to be attacked by them—The conditions under which Malignant Tumours may be modified anatomically, and how these should Influence our Treatment— Case—Osteoid Cancer. The Malignant Tumours of Bone are analogous to, or are identical with, the malignant tumours in the soft parts, with perhaps the exception of the hard cancer. Osteo- CEPHALOMA, Or Cerebeiform Osseous Cancer, presents all the appearances of ordinary medullary sarcoma, except that there are spicula of bone occasionally in the tumour, from the denser osseous texture giving way more slowly than the soft textures. Very soon the whole bone becomes involved, so that we often could not tell where bone had existed. There may be no ap- pearance of earthy matter, the whole being converted into a medullary mass. The form of malignant disease in bone which corresponds to scirrhus or hard cancer is to some extent modified by the texture in which it occurs, its appearance being different from scirrhus in the breast, though very like that disease in the liver. At first, in this disease of bone the medulla is chiefly affected ; it becomes altered in structure and contains a sort of amorphous-looking deposit, with numerous cancer cells in it. The Haversian structure yields very rapidly, and the cavity becomes filled with a mass of diseased texture. This condition extends towards the denser part of the shell of the bone, and fracture of the cancerous bone may take place. The disease is generally attended with pain, of rheumatic character, and often supervenes as one of the terminations of cancer in the soft parts, as the breast or testicle. The whole system is contaminated, and deposits take place into the textures of the body generally, and then the bone becomes L

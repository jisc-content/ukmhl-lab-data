LECTURE VL Local Dangers of Suppuration—From the tendency of Pus to point towards tlic Mucous or Integumentary Surfaces—From encroachment on important Structures—From involvement of Bones and Fascia. Sinus and Fistula—Causes which oppose successful Treatment—Treatment. The Local Dangees of Suppuration are various and im- portant. They arise chiefly from the mechanical pressure which an increasing suppuration creates on the tissues in its neighbourhood, hut in part also from those tissues becoming themselves involved in the ulcerative action. If an abscess be deeply seated under a dense fascia, the pus is thereby prevented from pointing towards the surface, and, being thus circumscribed, it tends to burrow and dissect its way among the surrounding structures, producing in the first place mechanical disturb- ance, which, by exercising an unnatural and injurious pressure, tends to impair the vitality of the adjoining tissues, and so pre- pares the way for the more destructive ulcerative action which may follow. The local dangers of abscess are modified according to its position ; and of these dangers the most important may be classified thus :—First, Such as arise from the proximity of an abscess to mucous canals or important cavities. Second, Those produced by tlie encroachment of an abscess on important vascular structures ; and Third, Those arising from the involve- ment of bones and fascia. In the first class, the danger arises from the tendency of collections of pus to point towards tlie free surfaces of the body —the cutaneous or mucous ; influenced by the general law, that the direction will be that in which it meets with least resist- ance. Thus, in abscess in the ischio-rcctal fossa, the pus, bounded below by the dense integument of tlie hip, and by the ischio-

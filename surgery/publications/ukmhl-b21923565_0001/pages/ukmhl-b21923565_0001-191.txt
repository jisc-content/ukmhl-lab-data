157 PHAGEDENIC SORES. —not purgative—combined with quassia, and after a time a few- doses of iodide of potassium (in five-grain doses), though this remedy is not to be trusted to at the first. There is one condition of sore, however, in which we should not use mercury at all, and that is where the sore is very irritable, or where there is any tendency to phageda3na. In such cases the mercury is contra-indicated ; it is not a safe remedy where there is much irritability of consti- tution, or where there is much local irritability of the sore, or much febrile excitement. The phagedenic venereal sore is met with at certain seasons, and as the result of certain forms of virus, apparently where it appears to be more virulent than usual, or from a want of cleanliness, or in certain states of the atmosphere ; under one or more of these conditions the sores have a tendency to take on this action. In such cases the phagedjena proceeds in a variety of forms ; we have it assuming the acute irritable form with a black slough, and the whole prepuce sloughing, leaving the glans exposed, or the gians itself being involved rapidly ; the phagedenic sore also assumes an irritable, ragged appearance, but without any great degree of inflammation of the penis, and with no black spot, but proceeding quite as rapidly as in the former case. Sometimes it goes on more slowly, apparently as a simple sore, but undermining and destroying the integu- ment of the penis. Sometimes the phagedsena proceeds very rapidly, as in the gray phagedsena, with a dark-gray slough, and the edges everted, but without the intense erysipelatous inflammation of the black phagedsena ; occasionally its progress is excessively rapid, the whole penis in front of the sore be- coming gangrenous in less than twenty-four hours. We require to be very active in our treatment of the phagedenic chancre; the surface of the sore must be destroyed with sulphuric or nitric acid to get rid of the unhealthy action, and then charcoal poultices and Condy's lotion, or carbolic acid lotion or oil applied. If there be any tension it must be relieved, sometimes even by making punctures or incisions along the sides of the penis ; if there be phymosis, the prepuce should be

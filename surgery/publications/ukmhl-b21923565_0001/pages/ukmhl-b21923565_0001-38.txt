It INFLAMMA TION. is uneasiness rather than positive pain. The rise in the pulse is but slight, and there is no great constitutional disturbance. In chronic inflammation of certain important organs there are febrile symptoms present, more especially at night; there is a feeling of lassitude, the palms of the hands are hot, with slight head- ache or uneasiness. Then there is restlessness at night, and perspiration takes place towards the morning. The pulse is more accelerated in the morning and in the evening than through the day. We must bear in mind that, though the symptoms are less marked than in acute inflammation, important alterations in structure are taking place insidiously, and we must therefore not be deceived by the apparent mildness of the malady. Treatment.â€”In chronic inflammation depletion is contra- indicated : instead of lowering the circulation, our object is to stimulate it, both locally and generally. In chronic conjunctivitis, for example, we use. stimulants and astringents, such as solu- tions of nitrate of silver, sulphate of copper, and sulphate of zinc, to get rid of the passive congestion. The use of blisters, or other form of counter-irritation, also the employment of deobstruent and alterative remedies, are specially indicated. To combat the low form of febrile action, and support the general strength, we have recourse to preparations of bark, chalybeate tonics, and generous diet. The formation of white fibrous tissue is a frequent result of inflammation, and leads to thickening and consolidation. It is a very common result of inflammation of serous membranes, such as the pleura and pericardium. In synovial membranes likewise this termination is sometimes met with, and it fre- quently results from chronic inflammation of the submucous tissue, where it gives rise to thickening, which, in the case of canals, such as the urethra, rectum, and cesophagus, produces stricture of these passages.

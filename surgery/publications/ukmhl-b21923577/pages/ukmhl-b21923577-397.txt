INJUEIOUS EFFECTS OF MEECUEY. 377 bones, and of the joints, being a considerable portion of the symptoms with which we are well acquainted as the secon- dary symptoms of syphilis. I must observe, in the first place, that we know all the symptoms that I have just men- tioned may be produced by syphilis treated without the aid of mercury j we frequently see them all in individuals that have taken no mercury; we have, therefore, clear evidence that all these effects may be produced by the disease. We have not the same kind of proof that they can be produced by mercury; on the contrary, mercury is given in many diseases besides syphilis, and to a considerable extent; but in no instance do we find it then produce eruptions like syphilis, iritis, disease of the bones, of the periosteum, or of the nose. The effects in question may then be produced by syphilis without mercury; but we have no proof that they can be caused by mercury without syphilis. It is true that mercury and syphilis, taken together, may bring forth that which neither will produce singly. I readily admit that the injudicious use of mercury and the repeated employment of it in some cases may act prejudicially on the system, and that a perseverance in its use where it exerts some of its noxious influences may aggravate the symptoms of syphilis, may cause them to return more easily, and may make them more difficult to cure. Thus, the employment of mercury, under such circumstances, may increase the difficulties which belong to the disease itself. I cannot, however, at present see any evidence that mercury is capable of producing these symptoms, which we are in the habit of witnessing as the effects of syphilitic poison, where no mercury has been used â€¢ and certainly there are mischiefs enough arising from the injudicious and imprudent use of mercury without adding those that do not belong to it. All we want is to know the truth, to learn what the remedy can effect, and what it can

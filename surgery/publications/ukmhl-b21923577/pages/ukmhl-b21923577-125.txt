TEEATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 105 agreeable to the patient's feelings, the local application should be warm. The lotions already described may be applied tepid, so as to avoid the uneasy feeling caused by cold. Warm fomentations are effected by flannels immersed in hot water, wrung out in a coarse towel, applied to the part and frequently renewed. If this plan is followed up effectively, the flannels being hot and large, they sometimes excite general perspiration. We read of mucilaginous and narcotic fomentations, as pre- pared by decoctions of marsh mallow, chamomile, poppy, hemlock, henbane and other herbs; unctuous applications are also mentioned, containing some greasy matter. Although these probably act only as means of applying warmth and moisture, patients have faith in their virtues, and the nar- cotics, when strong, may have some soothing effect. Bran, on which hot water has been poured, or warm grain, in a linen or flannel bag, will be found convenient by retaining warmth and moisture for a long time, when frequent changes might be troublesome or injurious; a bag of warm salt may be used when dry warmth is required. Poultices are made of bread, or linseed well-powdered. They should be prepared with boiling water. No positive rules have been hitherto laid down for distinguishing the cases to which cold and warm applications are respectively most applicable. Perhaps cold may be preferable in incipient in- flammations of external parts, warm when the inflammation is fully developed or seated below the surface. Warmth with moisture, seems to exert a relaxing influence when fibrous structures are involved, as in the case of inflamed joints. The means which have been described are to be repeated and continued in some shape or degree until the inflammation is removed. A cautious course should be pursued for a short time, until the healthy state of the affected part and of the

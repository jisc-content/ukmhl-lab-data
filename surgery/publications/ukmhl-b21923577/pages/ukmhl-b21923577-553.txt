It was on the outer side of the left mammary gland, which was naturally small, and it had not given much pain. The wound healed satisfactorily. The part removed was lobulated, the cut surface being granular, and found by Mr. Coote, who examined it carefully, to show many dilated ducts, dividing and subdividing which he discovered, by careful dissection, to be lactiferous tubes. Both Mr. Stanley and myself were struck with the resemblance which it bore to the so-called pancreatic sarcoma of Mr. Abernethy. She came to me in 1858 or 1859, in much suffering and anxiety, with the left side of the chest swollen generally, but more particularly in and around the situation of the cicatrix, the parts being deep red and firm to the feel; she could not use the left arm, which she had before moved freely.

She lives in the country, and I have not seen her since the last operation, but I have heard from a near connection, that she is in good health at present (September, 1862). This case is important in more than one point of view. It teaches us that a primary affection of the

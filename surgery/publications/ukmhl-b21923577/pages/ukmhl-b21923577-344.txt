324 SCROFULA. semble children in this respect, becoming weak, with a painful sense of sinking unless they take something to eat about once in four hours. The condition of the skin is a matter of importance in the management of the scrofulous, in whom a dry, harsh, and pallid state of the surface, shows clearly that the cutaneous circulation is imperfect, and that its important office as an excretory organ must be either partially deficient or alto- gether wanting. Warm bathing is advantageous; where this cannot be procured, daily ablution of the entire surface with tepid water and soap will answer the purpose, the temperature being gradually reduced, especially as strength improves, and according to the season of the year; the ablutions to be followed by a thorough dry rubbing. When strength is im- proved so that the shock can be borne,the shower bath, either cold or with the water slightly warmed will be serviceable. Warm clothing should be worn in such a state of skm, especially in the colder parts of the year. It is a very mis- chievous notion to suppose that the weakness which exists in scrofulous subjects can be remedied by hardening them, as it is termed j that is, by allowing them to be exposed to cold and vicissitudes of temperature, with insufficient clothing. The animal powers are comparatively defective, and should not be exposed to such trials. It is desirable that scrofulous subjects should have exercise; and that they should be aUowed to go into the air, properly protected from cold. It is found, by experiments on animals, that the power of gene- rating and preserving heat is less in young subjects than in adults; and less in proportion as the individual is younger. According to the age and power of the young person, walking and riding may be resorted to, with the active sports and pursuits natural to childhood, with the benefit of exer- cising and strengthening the muscles. There will be suffi-

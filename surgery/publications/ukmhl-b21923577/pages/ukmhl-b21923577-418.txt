398 SYPHILIS. probably meant the sore with indurated base; the others are distinguished from this, not by being soft, but by wanting the firm basis. In many cases this induration, not existing m the early stage, is developed gradually, so that the same sore would be soft and hard in different stages of its progress. Sores have again been divided into infecting and non- infecting, thus reviving the old and happily forgotten pseudo- svphilitic doctrine, without the name. This would be an important pathological and practical distinction, if true. Before these terms are adopted, the difference which they express in the essential nature of the affections should be clearly established, which is far from being the case at present. Treatment of primary sores. As the mischief pro- ceeds from the direct application of a local irritant or poison, the notion has been entertained that its pro- gress might be prevented by excision in an early stage, or effective destruction of the surface by an escharotic. I have not seen or known of any instance in which the former proceeding has been resorted to. It would be so obviously inapplicable to the greater number of primary affections, that we may doubt whether it has ever been actually put m practice. The nitrate of silver may be safely tried while the sore is small, and a second application, after the effect of the first has gone off, may be made. It has been strongly as serted that if this is done within four days from the first appearance of the sore, there will be no danger of secondary svmptoms. Without guaranteeing this statement, I see no objection to the proceeding. We seldom see eases early enough to try the principle fairly. _ It is clearly established, by general experience, that mer- cury is prejudicial in sloughing sores, that it aggravates all the symptoms, local and general, and that it may lead to lav,, or entire loss of the glans, prepuce, or penis.

FUNGUS HJEMATODES. 573 cellular, or in some organ, as in muscles or in the viscera. Distinct depositions and infiltration may occur in conjunction, the deposition in both ways being sometimes so abundant as to give the appearance of an organ being converted into a mass of the disease. The newly formed substance often resembles that of the brain in consistence, and even in colour; it is soft, pulpy, breaking down under the pressure of the finger; sometimes described as greasy. It is whitish, grayish, reddish, brownish, often mixed with coagulated blood, of which streaks, spots, or portions of various size, are disseminated through it. The entire mass is sometimes reddened through- out by the admixture of blood; there are sometimes cells containing fluid blood, recent coagula, or serum. The con- sistence varies; it is often soft, elastic, and conveying a sense of fluctuation so deceptive, that even experienced surgeons have sometimes formed wrong opinions respecting the nature of a disease, and have punctured a swelling in the belief that it contained fluid. In other instances the consistence is firm, and even hard, so that the nature of the disease cannot be determined by that single character. Sometimes the disease increases to an immense bulk, dis- tending the skin enormously, and completely disfiguring the affected part. It approaches to the surface, as in other cases ; the skin is thinned and tense, red or livid, and soon rises into a prominence, which is soft, and gives way by ulceration. Then comes the protrusion of a soft, irregular fungus, from which an offensive ichor flows abundantly; this sometimes bleeds, the blood partially coagulating on the surface; some- times it sloughs, and dead portions come away from time to time. Although this disease, like cancer, has usually an in- dolent period, and may even remain in that state for years, its growth is more commonly rapid and painful; suffering increases as it comes near the surface, and passes into the

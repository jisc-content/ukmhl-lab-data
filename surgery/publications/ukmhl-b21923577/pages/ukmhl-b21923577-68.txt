If the inflammation continues, the symptoms increase in intensity with total loss of rest. The local disturbance may proceed so far that the part can no longer sustain it, and partial mor- tification ensues. A portion of the skin assumes a dirty brownish or blackish colour, indicating that it is dead ; and the part thns deprived of its vitality, is technically called a slouoh. Under a less violent degree of inflammation, matter forms S that is, a thickish yellow or whitish fluid, known by the name of pus, i* ponred out by the inflamed vessels into ft. substance of the part, being deposited in one spot, which is called an abscess: this is technically known by the term suppuration. Or, without proceeding to cither of these states, the swelling of the part may diminish, the pain and redness slowly lessen, the symptoms and effects of inflammation gradu- ally disappear: the natural state returns by degrees and the power of executing the natural function is restored, m other words, the symptoms of inflammation slowly subside, aid the pm-t recovers; this is called resolution.

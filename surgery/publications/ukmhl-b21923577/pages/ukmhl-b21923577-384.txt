Ordinary antiphlo- gistic means simply, with rest and reduced diet, were suffi- cient, no mercury having heen employed during that time in any primary or secondary syphilitic affections. He says that in most instances the cure was slower than if mercury had heen used, though in some the sores healed rapidly. It appears, too, that there was a greater number of secondary affections, hut that those were always mild, and that they gave way to simple treatment without mercury. Thus he overturned the hitherto prevalent notion of mercury being absolutely necessary for arresting the progress of the disease, and showed that syphilis does not possess that destructive character which had been previously ascribed to it. In my opinion this is the most important step that has been taken towards understanding the nature and treatment of the venereal disease; and I should place the truth, thus esta- blished by Mr. Rose, far beyond any of the speculations that are contained even in the work of Mr. Hunter. In consequence of the researches of Mr. Rose, the non-mercurial treatment of the venereal disease has been extensively tried in the British army; and registers have been kept at the Army Medical Board showing the result of the treatment, both with and without mercury, from which comparative estimates of the two plans may be made. In other parts of Europe similar investigations have been carried on, with similar results; and the consequence of these inquiries has been a general revolution of opinion on the subject, and a corresponding change in practice. Persons who have the venereal disease are now no longer doomed to go through those long and severe courses of mercury winch they underwent heretofore. Mr. Rose, like Dr. Ferguson, had enjoyed opportunities during the Peninsular campaigns of observing how little

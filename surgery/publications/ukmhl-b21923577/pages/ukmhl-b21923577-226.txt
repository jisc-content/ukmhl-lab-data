206 MORTIFICATION. loss of blood is prevented by its previous coagulation in the vessels, which extends considerably above the point of separation. Thus the femoral artery has been found closed by coagulum in amputation of the thigh for mortification of the leg. In amputating immediately below the knee for mortification of the foot extending above the ankle, I tied the three arteries of the leg, although they did not bleed. The time necessary for completing the separation varies, according to the size of the part and the nature of its component structures, from a few days to weeks or months. The constitutional symptoms are very various. There may be none in some cases of small mortifications whether from external or internal causes, such as that of skin covering the tibia, from a blow, that of the thinned integu- ment covering an abscess or an aneurism about to burst, or that of a toe in senile gangrene. As mortification is fre- quently preceded and accompanied by active inflammation, the general disturbance in those cases is the same as m inflammations. But, when the loss of vitality has oc- curred, the symptoms change; there is a remission both of the local and general disturbance. We observe the cor- respondence between the local and the general affection here as in other cases. Hence, when a considerable mor- tification has occurred, there is great depression of the vital powers. The symptoms assume the typhoid type, if we may use an expression which is rather indefinite. The pulse is feeble and intermittent; there are faintings, with a sense of languor and weakness. Cold sweat supervenes, attended with complete muscular prostration and subsultus tendinum. The sensorial functions become imperfect; there is either lovr delirium or stupor; the tongue is dry and brown. There is hiccough, with tympanitic swelling of the abdomen. There

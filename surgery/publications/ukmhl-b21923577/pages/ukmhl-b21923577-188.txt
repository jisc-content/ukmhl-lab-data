168 CHRONIC ABSCESS. June, 1828, regarded as lumbago. This lasted till June, 1829, when a tumour appeared and gradually increased. In June, 1830, when I first saw him, it was as large as my head, at the back of the loins and pelvis, obviously con- taining fluid, without pain or impulse on coughing. There was stiffness of the loins, so that he bent the knees to reach any- thing on the ground. He was thin and pale, but rest, appe- tite, &c, were good, and he had walked from his residence, two miles, to consult me. I punctured it June 15th; five pints of dull yellowish watery fluid escaped, completely emptying the tumour. The puncture healed; I applied a broad bandage, enjoining rest. On July 15th he had completely recovered, and walked to see me, when puncture was repeated, two and a half pints of serous fluid discharged, with a few small flakes towards the end. The puncture healed. It was repeated, and a pint and a half drawn off. In about a week, although the puncture had healed as before, in con- sequence of imprudent liberties, violent inflammation of the cyst came on, with high fever. A free opening was imme- diately made, giving issue to three pints of thick fetid pus, and then left open. August 18th. The fever soon disap- peared, the tongue was now clean, and the appetite good. Soon after the pulse became accelerated, and he grew thin. A large abscess formed in the back, which was punctured. He died hectic, the original abscess having healed. Chronic abscesses, although slow in progress, break at last, and discharge their contents. Instead of healing quickly after such an event, as phlegmonous abscesses do, they go on discharging for a long time, close very slowly, and often give rise to permanent fistute. When they open spontaneously, and more frequently when punctured, the surface of the abscess may become mflarccd and the secretion is altered. It is thin, fetid, and irntatm&

CHAPTER XII. POISONED WOUNDS—HYDROPHOBIA—VENOMOUS SERPENTS— DISSECTION WOUNDS. POISONED WOUNDS. The most formidable of these is the bite of a rabid animal, which, .although presenting no peculiarity either at the time of infliction or subsequently, introduces directly into the human frame a poison generated in certain animals when labouring under the same affection. This poison excites after an in- terval of a few weeks, sometimes extending to months, a violent, general, and peculiarly distressing disorder of the nervous system, speedily, and as far as our present know- ledge extends, invariably fatal. The general disease is called hydrophobia, which means literally, dread of water, from a singular symptom which is peculiar to it in the human subject; it is also called rabies or rabies canina, in English canine madness, or simply madness j in French, la rage. The disease is communicated by the saliva, which becomes poisonous in rabid animals. No noxious property is disco- vered in any other fluid, nor in any of the solids. Perhaps there may be an exception to this statement in the case of the blood j there is, at least, a difference of testimony on the subject. 17

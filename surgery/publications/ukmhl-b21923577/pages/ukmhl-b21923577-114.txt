94 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. You may employ calomel combined with jalap, compound extract of colocynth, or rhubarb. Calomel alone, or with these combinations, followed by the common purging mixture of infusion of senna with salts and manna, or by castor oil. The effect of purgatives is not confined to expelling from the digestive canal alimentary accumulations and unhealthy secretions; they stimulate the extensive mucous surfaces of the stomach and intestines, producing discharges from them, and act indirectly on the glands, which pour their fluids into the canal. By the repetition of such medicines, especially by the administration of saline aperients in small doses at short intervals, we keep up a constant discharge of watery fluids from this extensive surface, lessening the quantity of circula- ting fluids, and thus directly reducing vascular action. I need scarcely refer to the well-known debilitating effect of purging. Purgatives probably contribute to arrest local inflammation in another way, on the principle. of counter-irritation, by exciting the alimentary mucous membrane and drawing the circulating fluids to it in unusual quantity. Emetics, for- merly used in the treatment of imflammation, probably act in this way, rather than by merely expelling the contents of the stomach. When an irritable state of the stomach, nausea, or sickness, occasions the rejection of medicines, we may employ those active means which are efficacious in small bulk, such as calomel alone or combined with a little opium; croton oil. Saline aperients in the effervescing form, are sometimes retained when others are rejected; Seidlitz pow- ders. The infusion of senna, with Epsom or Rochelle salts, in the effervescing form; carbonate of soda added to the medicine, and lemon juice mixed at the time of taking it. When our purgatives are rejected by the stomach, we may

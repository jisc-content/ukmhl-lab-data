TETANUS. 303 with suffering, which, although great, is less than the agony of the convulsive paroxysms, which rapidly exhaust the patient. They have been called clonic, in contrast with the tonic or permanent spasm. The functions of the nervous system are nearly unimpaired. Cullen represents that the natural functions, those of the vascular, respiratory, and digestive systems are not disturbed. He states particularly that the circulation is not affected, that the blood is not altered, or, if changed at all, rather loose in consistence; that the appetite is not impaired, and that the functions of the digestive organs are performed regularly. This repre- sentation differs so entirely from the course of my own ex- perience, that'I can hardly suppose it to have been drawn from actual observation. The blood, instead of being loose in consistence, may be buffed and cupped. There is loss of appetite, with obstinate costiveness, considerable difficulty being experienced in obviating the latter. In the commence- ment of the affection the pulse, particularly in young and robust persons, is strong, and accelerated, rising from 100 to 120. The pulse, as well as the respiration, is accelerated in the convulsive attacks, when the patient is covered with profuse sweat. The violent spasms sometimes cause considerable local mischief, such as rupture of muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis, ecchymosis in the abdominal walls, about the fundus or sides of the bladder, or in the subperitoneal tissue. Examinations after death fail to disclose any morbid changes that are either constant or characteristic; they do not enable us even to localize the disease in any organ or system There may be in some instances subserous infiltration in the brain and increased quantity of fluid round the spinal cord and we may sometimes fancy that the latter is softened, but on other occasions these changes are not observed.

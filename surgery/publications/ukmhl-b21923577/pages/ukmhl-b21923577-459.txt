MUCOUS TUBERCLES—WARTS. 439 Treatment of mucous tubercles, warts, condylomata.—The first indication is to restore the irritated and inflamed surface, from which these growths proceed, to a healthy state. When the external organs, perinseum, and neighbouring skin, in females, are in a state of erythematous redness, with excoria- tions and superficial ulceration, aggravated by neglect and irregularities, careful ablution with soap and water is the first step; it maybe advantageously extended to the entire person. The part, when carefully dried, should be thoroughly soaked with solution of caustic, of two to five grains to the ounce. Lint wetted with solution of sulphate of zinc, three grains to the ounce, and kept on the part for two or three days, may be used instead. Means must be employed in the meantime to check the discharges which have kept up the irritation. The mucous tubercles may now be dusted with the oxide of zinc in powder, under which they shrink and dry up speedily, or they may require to be touched once or twice with nitrate of silver. The same means are applicable to small warty growths of the vascular and moist kind. Larger excrescences, whether in males or females, sometimes shrink and disappear under the powder consisting of sulphate of copper and powdered savine in equal proportions. Strong acetic and nitric acids are available for larger warty and condylomatous masses. If these strong applications should act too slowly and imper- fectly, the knife may be used, with the subsequent use of nitrate of silver, if a disposition to reproduction should appear. Very copious bleeding, which comes from the entire surface, may follow excision, and require the use of the tincture of the sesquichloride of iron or of the perchloride of the same metal. These affections possess no specific. character • they arc seen most commonly in connexion with venereal disease, but may arise equally from other causes of irritation.

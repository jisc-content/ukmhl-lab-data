SYPHILIS. 155 The case, thus far, shows the natural progress and the destructive effects of phagedenic ulceration, when unchecked; for, if we suppose the twelve pills taken before admission to have been mercurial, they had produced no sensible ope- ration on the system. It shows that phagedena, although essentially destructive, eating away the affected part by ulce- ration, as its name implies, is not necessarily active in its progress. It had here gone on uncontrolled for eight weeks, and merely destroyed a portion of integument. The effect, indeed, would have been more serious if the disease had been seated in the glans. The present case is an example of what might be called chronic phagedena. It demonstrates further the powerful influence of mercury over the disease, and its unequivocal instrumentality in effecting a cure. Some have believed that the use of mercury is capable of giving the phagedenic character to an ulcer. Here, however, the primary form of the complaint was pha- gedenic ; this character rapidly disappeared under the use of mercury, being succeeded by a healthy restorative process. W. Smith returned to the hospital, on September 10th, 1836, with a relapse of ulceration on the penis. I was absent from London at the time, and he consequently came under the care of my colleague, Mr. Lloyd. I understand that the whole dorsum of the penis was occupied by afoul, phagedenic sore, of circular figure, which extended a little in the direction of the pubes. The surface was so foul, and it extended so rapidly, that Mr. Lloyd had thought it proper to apply the strong nitric acid. The sore, when I saw it, was covered by the brown crust which follows the effective application of that escharotic. The separation of the eschar was followed by a clean and granulating surface, and cicatrization was soon completed. On this occasion no mercury was used, either

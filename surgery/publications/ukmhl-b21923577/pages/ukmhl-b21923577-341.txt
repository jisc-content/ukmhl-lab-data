SCROFULA. 321 Dr. J. Thomson says: " In this climate, at least, I think it may he fairly doubted whether there he any individuals who, in some period or other of their lives, are not liable to attacks of scrofula in some of the various forms which it assumes." ('Lectures on Inflammation/ p. 163.) If these representations should be admitted as well founded, it would save us the trouble of attempting to point out the external marks of scrofula, or to investigate its real nature. It is comparatively unfrequent in warm climates, though by no means unknown in them. The natives of warm regions suffer when they come into cold countries, as we see in indi- viduals of the dark races when they have lived some time in England. In the same way the monkey tribes, all of whom belong to warm climates, are subject in England to tuber- cular disease of the viscera. In this country the character of the disease varies according to season, being worse in winter and spring, better in summer and autumn. The next in order among the exciting causes is insufficient and unwholesome food, excess or irregularities in diet. These disturb the digestive organs, of which the mucous lining is easily disordered in such cases, and thus vitiate the nutrition of the body at its source. The injurious influence is aggra- vated by neglect of exercise, by sedentary and studious appli- cation for purposes of education, at an age when actipe exertion and sports in the open air would be more beneficial to mind and body. Thus disturbed digestive organs, pallid and dry skin indicating defective circulation in the capillaries, and flabby muscular flesh are generally found in these patients. Suckling children escape; they enjoy warmth, and have whole- some natural food. When several exciting causes act together, and in a powerful degree, they produce a state of constitution not dis - tinguishable from the naturally scrofulous. The crowded 21

SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS. 121 There may be liquid evacuations when more consistent matters in considerable masses, and even the hard lumps called scybala, remain in the canal. The colour of the motions depends principally, but not exclusively on the liver. Various kinds of food and medicine such as spinach 'and steel exert their influence. The great size of the liver, its peculiar organization and circulation lead to the conclusion that it must perform an important part in the changes which the nutritive mass undergoes after leaving the stomach, and in faecal excretion, though the exact nature and extent of this influence is not yet clearly explained. Its affections in these cases are obscure, and hardly appreciable by external examination; we judge of of its state by the colour of the evacuations; and it may contribute to the tenderness occasionally observed in the epigastric region. Changes in the urinary secretion may be expected when the functions of the stomach, intestines, and liver are per- verted, as it is an important office of the kidney to separate from the blood the residual portion of the new matter intro- duced by the lacteals. The urine, although clear when passed, becomes cloudy on cooling; it contains too much acid, and throws down deposits of lithate of ammonia in various shapes, or sometimes crystals of lithic acid; it may be deficient in quantity, and high coloured. Persons conversant with horses judge of their state by examining the coat; when it is smooth, and the skin is soft to the feel, and elastic, the animal is in good condition. The same criterion may be resorted to in the human subject When the skin is of a light flesh tint, smooth, and soft' pliant and elastic, we know that its immense capillary ei/ culationis in good order, and that its important secretions arc properly performed. The latter will be increased by

OPEKATION. 539 the disease is confined to one spot, the remainder of the gland being found quite healthy on careful examination after the operation. The two cases already related at pp. 507 and 536, illustrate in a most striking manner the importance of adhering to the rule I have now mentioned. In both the portion of gland removed was so considerable, having been in one equal in size to a hen's egg, in the other a third of the entire mass, that the operation could not have been much less serious than if the whole had been taken away, and the part left behind could not have been of any utility. The second case, at page 536, is most interesting in two other respects. The skilful surgeon who performed the operation could not have failed to remove all that was obviously diseased, yet mischief recurred, in a manner not to be mistaken, in five weeks. Again, with this evidence of active disposition to disease, it is very remarkable that the lady should have remained free from disease for so many years after the second operation. A patient may sometimes be desirous of having a small bit removed, though unwilling to lose the entire gland. I took out a small portion of genuine scirrhus, hardly larger than a horsebean, from the circumference of the gland; the breast remained free for four or five years, when it was necessary to perform the larger operation. In a lady, for whom I cut from the border of the breast a lump about the size of a small walnut, disease returned in four years, being then accompanied with swelling of the axillary glands. Small hard knots, to which in general the skin becomes gradually adherent, though they may be more deeply seated, occasionally form near the cicatrix, at some and possibly a considerable time after the operation. Sometimes unde- fined thickening and induration take place under the cicatrix which is involved in the change, becoming red and uneasy or painful. As such occurrences unavoidably excite alarm and

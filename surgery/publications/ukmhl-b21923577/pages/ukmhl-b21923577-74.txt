54 INFLAMMATION, application. Even here directly opposite conclusions have heen drawn by different inquirers, the difference being between transmission of blood in increased quantity and stagnation, between increased activity of vessels and atony. The more accurate inquiries of modern observers show that there is a gradually increasing obstruction of the circulation, where the disturbance is carried to the highest pitch, while the enlarged vessels in the circumference transmit the blood more actively. The following statements, which I do not pretend to indorse, present the general opinion of the day. After the application of a local irritant, the vessels first contract, but shortly afterwards dilate, and become tortuous and varicose j the current of blood above the spot irritated becomes sluggish, and if the injury be severe, ceases entaely. Within this area the fluid part of the blood is lost, the cor- puscles clinging to the walls of the vessels and adhering one to another. These changes in the blood-vessels are not primary but secondary phenomena, and microscopists next assert that the dilatation of the arteries is not an active, but a passive, process. The augmented supply of blood, it is argued, is not the result of an increased activity of the vessels ; on the contrary, it is due to their dilatation, which is a consequence of diminished vitality of the tissues. The conclusion accordingly is, that the cause of "inflammatory stasis" lies wholly in an influence exerted on the blood by the textures \ in other words, that it is Â« primarily the result of an increased attraction which the inflaming tissue exerts, as it were, suctionally, on the blood coursing withm its capillaries." . It would be a complete waste of time to examine further the various hypotheses respecting inflammation. It may be sufficient to say that it is disturbance of the circulating system, with an altered mode of exertion; but what the

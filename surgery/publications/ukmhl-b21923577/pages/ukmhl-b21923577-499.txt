NATURE OF THE POISON. 4,79 discharge of syphilitic sores, have totally failed in other in- stances. Mr. B. Bell, of Edinburgh, made several experi- ments for both of these purposes by inoculating gonorrhoeal discharge on the glans and prepuce with a lancet, which pro- duced no effect whatever, and applying in the same manner the secretion of primary syphilitic sores to the vagina and male urethra. When the secretion of a chancre was introduced by a small puncture into the surface of the male urethra, chancre was produced, chancre which led to the occurrence of secondary symptoms, and required a long course of treat- ment for their cure. Here I may observe, that Mr. Hunter's statement that the application of syphilitic matter, either to the vagina or urethra, that is, to a secreting mucous surface, will produce, not ulcer, but discharge, is not strictly correct For we find, not very frequently indeed, but so often that it is perfectly well known, that chancre may take place within the orifice of the male urethra, and a troublesome thing it is when it occurs there. We also know that chancre may take Place at the entrance of the vagina. The urethra and vagina - both susceptible of the occurrence of syphilitic ulcera- The general result of our experience leads to the opinion that gonorrhoea and syphilis are essentially distinct in the* »a -; that the poison producing the two must be diffei r and that there is a greater difference between the affections' - can be accounted for simply by diversity of textu 7n heir respective seats.

367 USE OP MERCURY. syphilis, it must be used continuously and daily, so as to pro- duce its peculiar effect upon the constitution, and this effect must be maintained for some length of time, that is, for several days or weeks, until, in short, the cure is effected. This is called a course of mercury. We cannot say that the same doses, either in amount or number, are to be continued throughout. As this powerful remedy is capable of acting in- juriously or at least unpleasantly, care must be taken not to carry it further than is necessary to produce the required effect on the symptoms, and to keep up that until they are removed. The case must, therefore, be watched, the quantity of mercury being diminished or increased, left off for a time, and renewed according to circumstances. This process causes little inconvenience when carefully conducted, under proper precautions in diet and general management. The action of mercury on the constitution is increased by warmth and diminished by cold; it goes on more favorably when the patient remains in a uniform temperature. It was formerly the general practice to confine the patient strictly to his chamber, and, if we should wish to produce the effect of the remedy quickly and safely, especially in weakened and deli- cate states of health, the patient should keep to the house, occupying an apartment of regulated temperature; under other circumstances this confinement is not necessary. Still, as the constitution is more easily disturbed by external in- fluences under the use of mercury, exposure to cold and damp, or to the night air, which might bring on rheumatism or other disorders, should be avoided. With these precautions, persons may follow their usual occupations under the careful use of the remedy in ordinary cases. As the use of mercury generally causes some degree of feverish excitement, strong animal food with stimulating liquors would be improper. The diet should be light, broths, milk, bread, rice, and other

Secondly, it shows the advantage, in respect to the prolongation of life, of removing at an early period secondary formations of scirrhous character in the seat of the original mischief. Another case, of still more striking character in respect to the first of the two points alluded to above, was that of a widowed lady, aged sixty, of healthy constitution and active habits, who had never borne children: she consulted me for a circumscribed and firm tumour, without pain, in the left breast, about the size of a hen's egg.

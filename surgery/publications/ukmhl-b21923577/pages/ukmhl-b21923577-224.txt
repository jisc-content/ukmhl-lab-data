204 MORTIFICATION. greenish, livid, brown, or black hue; or it assumes various combinations of these tints. A sanious or bloody fluid is poured out under the cuticle, raising it into vesications or loosening it generally. These changes, which are preceded by aggravation of the inflammation, by a deeper tint of redness passing into lividity, and then by diminution of tension, are followed speedily in most cases by putrefaction. When the part, at the time of mortification, is loaded with fluids, these as well as the containing solids, undergo chemical decomposition. The various textures are softened, half dissolved, filled with a fetid sanies or reduced to a stinking pulpy mass. Gas is disengaged from the parts thus changed j and the fetor, which is always present and characteristic, is sometimes overpowering. This is gangrena humida, moist gangrene. It is mortification consequent on active inflammation, and hence may be called acute gangrene. Sometimes the dead part is found in a state very different from that just described; the preceding inflammation is not considerable, and the mortified portion, although brown or black, is dry, hard, and shrivelled; instead of dissolving by putrefaction, it remains hard and dry, and may be kept for years without undergoing further change. This is gangrena sicca, dry or chronic gangrene. These two strongly contrasted forms have been named hot and cold gangrenes. All parts which have a circulation are liable to mortifica- tion Thus we see this change in all the textures when an entire limb has perished. All, however, are not equally susceptible. Cellular tissue is the most prone j skm resists longer. Harder parts, such as fibrous structures, are less subject. Blood-vessels resist more than other soft textures ; hence we sometimes see them insulated and entire when the

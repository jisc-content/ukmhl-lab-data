TEEATMENT OP INFLAMMATION. 83 The pulse will not afford the criterion. If it be full, strong, and hard, the indication for general bleeding is clear; but it is sometimes low and oppressed, particularly in affections of the head; sometimes small, but hard and wiry, as in in- flammation of the peritoneum and bowels. We must be guided principally by the local symptoms. When they indicate high inflammation, and there is reason to fear that such inflammation may cause serious mischief in impor- tant organs or structures, we must take active measures to arrest it. General bleeding is among the most efficacious, and certainly more so than local. Ia treating acute inflammation of an important organ, especially in a robust or plethoric person, you must bleed largely, so as to produce a decided influence on the circula- tion, in order to arrest, through it, the local mischief. You cannot measure the quantity necessary for' this purpose beforehand, and you must be guided by its effects. In order to produce the required influence on the vascular system, it maybe necessary to take twenty, thirty, or more ounces of blood. Bleeding to syncope is sometimes advantageous; if this is done in the outset, perhaps no further loss of blood may be necessary, and little if any physicking. It has been more common on the Continent, at least in France and Italy, to take smaU quantities of blood and to repeat the abstraction frequently. A few ounces are taken aight and morning, and the plan is persevered in for several successive days. M. Boisseau, an intelligent modern writer, well acquainted with French practice, in peaking of bleeding in inflammatory fever, that is, local inflammation, attended with fever says that we should not take less than eight ounces at each bleeding; that this quantity is rarely sufficient, so that it is

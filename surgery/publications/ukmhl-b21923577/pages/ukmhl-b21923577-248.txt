228 MOKTIFICATION. It is advantageous to cover the whole limb from the toes to the knee, kept in a horizontal position in bed, with carded wool, which maintains an uniformity of temperature, and is thus especially serviceable if the circulation should be feeble. A dry and shrivelled toe, or piece of skin, may be wrapped in a bit of rag thinly spread with fresh lard or simple cerate, which need not be changed so long as there is no discharge. When separation commences, a soft linseed poultice may be applied, and removed when necessary by opening the lower part of the wool without uncovering the rest of the limb. The question of amputation will come under consideration in some cases of senile gangrene. The opinion of experienced surgeons has been so adverse to the operation as almost to have established a positive rule against its performance, grounded on the belief that from the unhealthy state of con- stitution to which the origin and extension of the mischief must be referred, destructive action may be expected in the wound instead of healthy repair. The cases of this disease may be arranged in two divisions; the one including those where the fault is altogether in the constitution,the otherwhere the constitution and health are sound, the disease depending on the state of the arteries. Mr. James, of Exeter, in the paper already quoted, has ably argued the question in favour of operating in instances of the latter kind, and has adduced the conclusive evidence of six cases in which amputation had been performed with perfect and permanent success, either in the thigh or leg, for senile gangrene in old and otherwise healthy persons. An herpetic mortification is sometimes seen in the legs of elderly and generally enfeebled persons. It begins with vivid redness of the skin, quickly passing into superficial mortifica- tion, the whole process being generally very painful. It may extend along one edge, separating and healing at. the other.

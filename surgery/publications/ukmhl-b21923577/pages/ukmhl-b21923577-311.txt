ESCHAKOTICS. 291 powders into a paste. Tor making an issue a portion of this paste, as thick, at least, as a half-crown, is placed in the hole cut in the plaster, then covered over, and the whole left on for six or eight hours. The nitrate of silver, although in such general and daily- use that the simple term caustic is understood both by sur- geons and others to designate this substance, is not as Mr. Higginbottom has justly observed, an escharotic. When effectively applied in substance or in strong solution, it may but does not always, vesicate, without acting more deeply. When applied to a moist surface, as that of a mucous mem- brane or an ulcer, it is immediately decomposed by the common salt found in all animal fluids, and converted into a muriate of silver, characterised by its white colour. It is thus that it may be taken into the stomach with impunity in large doses. Its astringent action on the minute vessels of the skin and of other structures to which it is applied is so unequivocally advantageous, that it is probably the most general and useful of all surgical applications. The solution in distilled water is a convenient form of the remedy, varying in strength from one or two grains to the ounce, the latter being the most common, to that of twenty or even thirty grains to a drachm. As the action of the remedy is quite superficial, the last-mentioned twenty-grain solution may be applied by means of a camel-hair brush with perfect safety to more or less extensive surfaces, the skin having been first cleared by effective ablution. The chloride of zinc, introduced of late years, is so powerful an escharotic that it is seldom used alone, though it does not act through the cuticle. It is most commonly combined with an equal proportion of plaster of Paris (sulphate of lime) or wheat flour. The powder is mixed, at the time of name with water, so as to form a paste, which may be spread on

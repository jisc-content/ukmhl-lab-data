CHAPTER I. ON THE NATURE AND DIVISIONS OF DISEASES; THEIR AR- RANGEMENT AND CLASSIFICATION; NOSOLOGY. It is the object of medicine to ascertain the nature and seat of diseases, in order to discover the causes, best means of prevention, and treatment. If we understood in each instance what organs are the seat of disease, and how they are affected, there would be little difficulty as to the subject of treatment. We should then be able to give an appropriate name to each disease, and to arrange them according to their natural affinities, that is, we might establish a rational noso- logy, or systematic catalogue of diseases. It happens unfortunately that in many instances we are unable to determine the nature of disease, while in others we cannot discover even its exact seat. Hence the names jf diseases are in many instances calculated to mislead, md those mere catalogues which are called nosologies ire really worse than useless. The difficulties, however, to vhich I allude, are not so great in that part of the subject vhich is our present object, viz., the surgical department, rhey are more forcibly felt in the affections of internal organs vhich, being situated at a greater or less distance below the urface, are withdrawn from direct observation and examina- ion, so that their precise condition in the first instance, and he changes they undergo from treatment, are often little uore than conjectural.

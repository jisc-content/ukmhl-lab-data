92 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. Convulsions are alarming, but not dangerous; they occur more frequently in children, arising from interruption of the supply of blood to the brain, and thus resembling the effect of the opposite state of cerebral circulation, which also causes convulsions. They are not unfrequently seen, in a slight degree, in conjunction with fainting from venesection. Remedies.—Horizontal position and stimuli, hyoscyamus freely. The most strongly marked case of this kind which I have seen was that of a man, who, having met with an accident in the street, was carried insensible into the shop of a neigh- bouring chemist, who proceeded to draw as much blood from the arm as would flow from the orifice. He was brought into the hospital, labouring under the most violent and alarming convulsions. They gave way slowly to the administration of henbane, with brandy and water, the head being shaved. It was an ordinary case of concussion, m which convalescence was not materially delayed by the well- meant but injudicious proceeding of the chemist. Delirium is not strictly immediate; first, fainting is noticed, then delirium, as the circulation is restored and reaction ensues; a rare occurrence. Mild cordials and narcotics, cold to the head. Blisters or sinapisms, if the affection continues. Coma.—Most common in children; a state of deep sleep, approaching to apoplectic. This, as well as convulsions and delirium, shows how the sensorium may be influenced by disturbance in the supply of blood. A. similar state may be produced in children by exces- sive purging, and is apt to be confounded with hydro- cephalus. Quiet; fluid nourishment, such as beef tea. Perhaps

The questions then remain, whether the opera- tion may prolong life, and to what extent, also whether it may be of advantage in any other respects ? In the cases related at pp. 516 and 517, it will have been seen that death may follow in a short time, even after opera- tions performed in an early stage of the complaint, on patients of sound constitution and in good health. On the other hand, after the operation, which is not dangerous, patients not unfrequently live in good health for some years, and this may happen under circumstances from which we might have been led to expect a different result.

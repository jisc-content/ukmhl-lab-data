QUESTION OF AMPUTATION. 251 cases the patients were placed under the most advantageous circumstances. Yet even here the successful attempts were few, and the limb, when saved, was of questionable value. The danger is greatest when the fracture is towards the middle of the bone. Amputation is generally necessary in comminuted fractures by gunshot of the lower extremity; in the upper, the necessity is less urgent. We cannot lay much stress on a few unexpected cures. The question is, what proportion of recoveries may be expected, out of a given number, in both modes of proceeding. When the head of the humerus has been broken, without great injury of the surrounding structures, removal of the damaged portion of the bone may supersede the necessity of amputation at the shoulder joint. An attempt to save the limb is more likely to succeed in the elbow or wrist than in the ankle, as the power of restoration is more considerable in the former cases than in the latter, and a stiff joint is in them of less consequence. 3. When the bone has been broken and the soft parts lacerated and crushed, without external wound, by a spent ball, or one striking the part obliquely. 4. When a considerable mass of soft parts has been shot away, for example in the thigh, especially if the artery be included, although the bone may not be broken. If the artery and vein should be divided, with fracture of the femur, amputation would be advisable, although the wound might not be serious in other respects. 5. If the bone should be extensively denuded, though not broken, by a piece of bombshell or small cannon shot traversing a limb. 6. When a limb is carried away by a cannon ball, explo- sion, or any other cause. The wound is lacerated, jagged, and bruised, the bone protruding and splintered. The regular

VARIETIES OF ULCERS. The nature and treatment of ulcers exhibit numerous and important differences. They may be common or specific. The latter, such as the carcinomatous, syphilitic, and scrofulous, will be considered in other parts of the course. Even common ulcers, or such as result from ordinary causes in constitutions free from morbid disposition, are various. They are influenced by position, for instance, by proximity to the centre of circulation, or remoteness from the heart; also by situation which may be favorable or unfavorable to the return of the venous blood. An ulcer of the leg will differ in appearance, according as the limb is in the horizontal or the perpendicular posture. Hence ulcers on the trunk heal quicker than those on the limbs, and those of the

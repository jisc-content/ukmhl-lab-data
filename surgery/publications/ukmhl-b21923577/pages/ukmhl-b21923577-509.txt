SECONDARY SYMPTOMS. 489 management, the copaiba may be taken from the beginning of the disease; the solution of the sulphate of zinc, of two grains in the ounce, cautiously increased, may be combined with it. The injection may be used four times, or even oftener, in the twenty-four hours. The copaiba not unfre- quently causes an exanthematous eruption, not unlike that of measles, without material pain or constitutional disturbance. It prevents perseverance with the remedy, and disappears when that is discontinued. The structure and physiological relations of the vagina are altogether different from those of the male urethra, and it has no direct connexion with the urinary system. These considera- tions explain what might otherwise appear anomalous, namely, that copaiba and cubeb pepper have no influence over gonor- rhoea in the female. Gonorrhoea! inflammation of the mucous membrane of the urethra runs through its course, and comes to a natural end, without entailing future ill consequences on the patient! There are, however, some instances in which secondary symptoms follow gonorrhoea, but they are so few that many practitioners have never seen a case of the kind, and hardly believe the possibility of such an occurrence. They, how- ever, who have had the most extensive experience in the treatment of this complaint recognise the possibility of secondary symptoms from gonorrhoea. This is the case with Mr. Carmichael. He says it is sometimes followed by papular eruption, superficial ulceration of the tonsil, and pains of the joints and limbs; but that the symptoms under such circum stances do not require the employment of mercury for their cure, ordinary antiphlogistic treatment accomplishing all that is necessary. Ia this, as in most other secondary affections the mild use of mercury is advantageous, if not absolute^ necessary. J

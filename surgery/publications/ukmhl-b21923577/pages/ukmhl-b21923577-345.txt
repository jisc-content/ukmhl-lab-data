Sedentary employment of all kinds should be limited in amount, the improvement of health and strength being the primary object, while learning and accomplishments are of secondary importance in both sexes. During the period of suckling, children are warmly clad, and kept much in contact with the mother, enjoying a supply of healthy nourishment produced by the hand of nature. Thus the two great exciting causes of scrofula under other circum- stances, exposure to cold and insufficiency or unwholesomeness of nutriment, are prevented in the case of infants at the breast. Change of air.â€”The greatest benefit is derived in cases of scrofula from residence in pure air, this alone, in many in- stances, being capable of doing more towards mending the state of the system than either external applications or internal remedies. It is vain, in many cases, to attempt relieving diseases of this kind while the patients remain in large towns, in crowded dwellings, in confined situations, and sedentary occupations. As soon as they escape and get into pure country air, the diseases which we had been attempting to remedy, but ineffectually, will get well of themselves. Sea air, however, has no specific influence over scrofula. The disease may arise in those who were born and have always lived near the sea. Nevertheless, to persons living in large towns, the tonic and bracing effects of the sea air pro- duce so great and beneficial an alteration that the worst forms of scrofulous disease often get well rapidly, simply by this influence. An infirmary is established at Margate for the reception of scrofulous patients during a part of the year, and the general practice is simply to cover the affected parts with cloths dipped in the salt water, trusting in other respects to the effects of the sea breezes.

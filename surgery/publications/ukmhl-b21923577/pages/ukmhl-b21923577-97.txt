77 TEEATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. and if one only suffer, the other cannot be employed safely on account of the close sympathy between the two organs. If the head is affected, mental study and other sources of cerebral excitement must be strictly avoided. But repose cannot be completely attained, when parts of involuntary action are the seat of disease. General rest in the recumbent posture tends to tranquillise such parts, as the heart for example. The position should be such as is favorable to the return of blood. In the case of inflam- mation attacking the lower extremities, the patient should be confined to bed. In the case of similar vascular ex- citement in the head, the sitting posture may be most agreeable. All external agency on the affected part, such as pressure, must be avoided; hence much manual examination is in- jurious ; the apartment should be light and well ventilated. We next come to the direct means of lessening and re- moving inflammation. On the treatment of inflammation, and first in its acute or violent form, when it is generally attended with inflammatory fever.â€”Among the'direct means of controlling acute inflam- mation, we may mention, in the first place, the abstraction of blood, that is, of the material by which the disturbance is kept up. In the figurative view on which the name of this affection is founded, blood may be termed the fuel by which the flame is maintained. By cutting off the supply of blood, all vital action is stopped as we see in the brain under syncope. Thus bleeding, considered abstractedly, may be regarded as the most speedy and effectual means of arresting the local mischief and lessening the general disturbance. Its practical employ- ment must be subjected to a careful consideration of the concomitant circumstances, of the natural constitution, the amount of bodily power, and the previous health of the

244 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. Gunshot wounds have been formerly supposed to be peculiar in their nature, and altogether different from other descriptions of injury. The violence, the damage, and the danger, are far greater, and the symptoms more alarming. Hence, at first, they were thought to be poisoned, and treated on that notion by supposed antidotes, such as turpentine, hot oils, balsams, &c. The great wars of modern times have afforded abun- dant opportunities of cultivating this department of surgery, which is therefore now well understood. The only pecu- liarities of these wounds are in the nature of the bodies by which they are inflicted, and in the degree of violence with which such bodies come in contact with the human frame. The injuries are inflicted by bullets, balls, fragments of shells, splinters of wood and stone; and these act with the greatest force. Hence laceration and contusion are carried to the highest degree with inevitable disorganization of the affected structures. The degree of violence is various : 1. Direct blow by the projectile in full force; the part is traversed, or a limb is carried away. 2. Direct blow with diminished force ; causing laceration, contusion, with fracture, the latter being generally splintered. 3. Oblique blow, consequent contusion and laceration of muscles, ecchymosis, fracture without breach of skin. This description of injury is popularly ascribed to the wind of the ball. Symptoms.â€”-The infliction of the wound may not be per- ceived when all the powers of the mind and body are strained to the utmost in a death-struggle, amid the heat, confusion, and stunning sounds of a battle. In other cases, it is attended with severe pain, and causes agitation, tremors, and alarm. Some- times there is great depression of the nervous system, and con- sequently of the circulation and other vital processes. There

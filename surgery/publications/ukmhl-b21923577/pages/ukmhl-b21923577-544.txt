524 CANCERâ€”DIAGNOSIS. that she had not thought it necessary to mention the cir- cumstance at the time of my first examination. This was soon developed into a general scirrhous state of the entire gland, which was freely removed, leaving an exposed surface of considerable extent, the repair of which had gone on favorably, hut slowly, when it was interrupted by alarming head symptoms, of a nature to leave no doubt that organic disease had occurred within the cranium, under the slow increase of which the patient graduaUy sank. In a lady who consulted me in the spring of 1832 for cancer of the breast, being then twenty-eight years of age, the disease had commenced two years previously. When I saw her there was scirrhus of the mammary gland, with the skin partially adherent to it, also a small, hard portion, the size of a nut, at the edge of the pectoralis major, and a single enlarged gland in the axilla. Two or three hard knots were observed in the skin, towards the circumference of the mam- mary gland. This lady, who had experienced great distress of mind from having been ill treated by her husband, was in a wretched state of health, so that an operation could not have been thought of, even if it had been otherwise advisable. Although, therefore, cancerous disease may occur unusually early in rare and exceptional cases, there is the strongest probability that an affection occurring earlier than the age of thirty-five cannot be of that character. The mammary gland, or chronic mammary tumour, is distinguished from the scirrhous disease in being a new for- mation or tumour, strictly so called; in appearing at an earlier age, for example, about twenty, before or soon after that time; in its looseness and mobility under the skin and upon the subjacent textures j in remaining unchanged for years, except, perhaps, in bulk; and in the absence of any extension to the skin or other neighbouring parts.

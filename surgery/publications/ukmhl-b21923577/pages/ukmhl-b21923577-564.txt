544 EPITHELIAL CANCER. disease, which is generally confined to the surface sometimes goes deeper, having a scirrhous formation for its base. Under the mucous membrane of the cheek I have seen, without much alteration of the surface, a whitish and not very hard tumour of round form, and not less than half or three quarters of an inch in thickness. A section of the ordinary labial cancer shows the basis to consist of the integument con- verted into a texture not unlike that of the scirrhous mam- mary gland, but less hard, quite distinct from the other structures, which are unaffected. Microscopical examination detects an abundance of cells resembling the epithelium of the part intermingled with the natural structure. Speaking generally the complaint is not a painful one; patients often say that they have not suffered throughout; sometimes the local disturbance is more active, and there is more suffering. The absorbent glands under the lower jaw become diseased in the progress of the case, one or more being moderately enlarged. At a later period, sometimes several years after an operation of which the cicatrix may remain sound, the glands along the side of the neck enlarge, and soon form a con- siderable firm mass, presenting in that respect a striking con- trast with the small size of the original affection. The disease in the lip clearly owes its origin to an external irritation, from the contact and pressure of the clay pipe in tobacco-smoking, and it is most certainly brought on by using a short pipe resting on and entirely supported by the lip. Fortunately for those classes who in my early years never dreamt of smoking, but now find it a necessary of life, the use of the cigar has never led to cancer of the lip within my experience. Should there be any doubt whether the use of the clay pipe can do all the mischief which has been ascribed to it, I may mention the case of an officer of title, with an obscure affection of the throat terminating fatally after a long

490 GONORRHOEA: PHIMOSIS. There are some other circumstances occasionally attendant on gonorrhea which require to he mentioned. The disorde r of the urethra may cause inflammation of the glands m the groin; but if you adopt the measures which the local com- plaint requires, and keep the patient at rest, you will not be much troubled by this symptom; at all events, its treatment is to be conducted upon ordinary principles. The gonorrheal inflammation of the urethra when violent spreads, not only backwards along the canal, but forwards to the glans, which swells and reddens, and to the lining of the prepuce, which becomes thickened and hardened, particularly at the orifice, which loses its elasticity, becomes contracted, and no longer capable of being withdrawn, so as to denude the glans. This condition is called phimosis.- Local means must be used to reduce the inflammation, and with proper care the complaint is not serious in a case of simple clap. The inflammation of the glans and prepuce may mcrease, occupying the whole thickness of the latter, which becomes swelled, red, tense, and painful, in addition to the conation of the orifice. The inflamed prepuce may slough to a greater or less extent, and the glans may be found, when exposed, to have ulcerated or even to have sloughed superficially. Such mischiefs may be prevented in an early stage by active means, such as leeching, cold lotions or poultices, with saline aperients and antimony. Careful and effective syringing with poppy fomentation or tepid water should be performed daily, to remove the gonorrhoeal discharge and irritating secretions of the inflamed surfaces retained by the phimosis If the inflammation should continue, the only way to preven the more serious mischiefs to the glans and prepuce is to slit up the latter in its whole length, which gives numerate An opposite condition of the prepuce, ealled paraph,****,

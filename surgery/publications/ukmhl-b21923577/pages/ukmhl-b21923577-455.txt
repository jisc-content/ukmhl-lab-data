IRITIS. 435 The iodide of potassium may be advantageously substituted for mercury under certain circumstances; for instance, if the latter, fairly tried, has not done all the good that might be expected, if the inflammation, although abated, still lingers on, or if it should relapse, or mercury should disagree. The use of belladonna is advisable in conjunction with the mercury, in order to counteract the tendency to contraction of the pupil". This remedy does not act on the iris so long as it is actively inflamed; it may be employed as soon as the inflammation begins to decline. As the solution of the extract or of atropine dropped into the eye would irritate, the extract, moistened with water to the consistence of honey, should be smeared on the brow and supraorbital region once in twenty-four hours, and washed off at the end of an hour. The combined effect of the mercury and beUadonna in a recent state of the affection may detach adhesions of the pupil or cause their elongation, so that they may not interfere with the motions of the iris. When the nocturnal pain is severe, and not relieved by the means already specified it may be lessened or entirely prevented by rubbing at bedtime on the frontal and temporal regions, six grains of mercurial ointment mixed with two grains of opium. Where iritis has come to an end, vision being completely restored, the eye not unfrequently remains irritable or as patients call it, weak, for a longer or shorter time, more par- ticularly if the attack has been acute or the treatment either imprudently delayed or not followed up with sufficient care The eye will not bear strong light, exposure to cold, or em- ployment m reading or writing, without temporary vascular congestion, lacrymation, and pain. Eelapse of inflammation is easily produced by such causes. Patience and prudent care are the best preventives and remedies. Continued pain m the organ may require a blister at the back of the neck

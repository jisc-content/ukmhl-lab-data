VENOMOUS SEKPENTS. 271 The hooded or spectacle snake of the East Indies, Cobra de capello (Coluber naia), is powerfully venomous, destroying a fowl within a minute, a dog in half an hour, and a human subject in a few hours. There are actively poisonous serpents in considerable numbers in some of the West India islands, at least in Martinique and St. Lucia. One of them is called the yellow or spotted snake; Vipere fer de lance (Coluber carinatus, Linn.). On one occasion an officer and several men were killed within a short time, dying from six to twelve hours after the bite. The viper or adder is the only venomous serpent found in England. The bite produces troublesome local symptoms, but is not dangerous and still less fatal, though it may have caused death in some excep- tional cases. Fontana found that three vipers could not destroy a dog of sixty pounds weight. The poison does not act on the sound skin, or mucous membrane; thus it may be taken into the stomach with im- punity. A student swallowed the poison of four large vipers without injury and no effect was produced on a pigeon by taking the poison of ten vipers. Like the poison of hydro- phobia, it must be introduced into a wound. In many expe- riments on dogs, punctures with lancets charged with venom, even from the most poisonous Indian serpents, failed to produce any effect, although the bite of the animal was rapidly fatal. The local effect is considerable swelling, rapidly extending along the limb and to the trunk, the skin being mottled and dark purple or livid; inflammation and suppuration of the cellular membrane may supervene. The general symptoms are vomiting, torpor, and loss of consciousness, sometimes a state resembling intoxication; enfeebled action of the heart. If the case were seen sufficiently early, excision of the wounded part, scarification and ablution, and ligature above

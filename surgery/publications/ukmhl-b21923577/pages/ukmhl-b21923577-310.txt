290 BSCHAKOTICS. This is held on the part by a small instrument with a ring of metal and a wooden handle. It is ignited at the top, and may be kept in strong combustion by the blowpipe until it is burnt out, when the portion of skin is reduced to a brownish eschar and there is considerable redness to a greater or less extent in the circumference. Pure potash, fused and formed into sticks for convenience of application, is employed either to destroy morbid growths or diseased surfaces, or to disorganize a portion of skin for the establishment of an issue. It quickly destroys the tissues, reducing them to a dirty brownish pulp, and the destruction may be carried to any desired depth by wiping away the disintegrated tissues with lint, and then renewing the appli- cation. Its great deliquescence, which would extend the escharotic action further than we might wish, must be guarded against. Thus, in making an issue, we put together two or three portions of adhesive plaster, and cut a hole in the centre of the required size of the issue, and rub this part sufficiently with the caustic. A piece of plaster is then put over it, the whole is removed in three or four hours, and a poultice is sub- stituted, which is to be continued until the>char is separated. In another mode of proceeding, sometimes preferred, the pure potash is combined with an equal proportion of quick lime, which is a caustic like the potash, but not used alone in surgery. The two powders are to be rubbed together and put into a stoppered bottle. When required for use the desired quantity is moistened by alcohol, so as to form a mass called Vienna paste. This is a new name for an old remedy, the combination of quick lime with pure potash having been well-known in the hospitals of London at least from the very beginning of the present century under the name of Calx cum Kali puro, or paste caustic, soft soap having been employed instead of alcohol to make the

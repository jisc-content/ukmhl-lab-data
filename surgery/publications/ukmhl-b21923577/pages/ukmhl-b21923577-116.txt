96 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. Liquor Ammonite Acetatis may be given in water, or Mis- tura Amygdalae. The alkaline carbonates of soda, potash, and ammonia, neu- tralized with lemon juice or citric acid, or the same combi- nations in the effervescing state, are at least grateful to the patient; ijhey diminish thirst. Saline draughts and mixtures, though commonly adminis- tered under the name of febrifuge remedies, are not of much efficacy in themselves. They are, however, convenient vehicles for more active substances, for saline purgatives, such as Epsom or Rochelle salt; for nitre, antimony, digitalis, colchicum. The most powerful medicine for acting on the skin is antimony, more particularly in the two preparations of James's powder, a secret medicine, and the tartrate or potassio- tartrate. Its influence is not confined to the skin j according to the dose, the tartrate, a very powerful medicine, and much more so than the other, produces perspiration, nausea, sickness or purging. In these various operations it is an efficacious means of combating inflammation. To excite perspiration, it is given in doses of one eighth to one quarter of a grain, generally in combination with saline medicines; from' one quarter to one half a grain, to cause nausea; from one half a grain upwards, it vomits and purges. If such doses are repeated at short intervals, so as to maintain the effect, perhaps there is no more powerful means, by in- ternal medicine, of lessening the power of the heart's action. The number and strength of the pulse are rapidly reduced under the continuance of nausea and sickness thus produced. Of late years the Italian physicians have employed the tar- trate of antimony in larger doses than I have mentioned, not to sweat or vomit, but, from observing its powerful effects IB combating inflammation. They exhibit it as a contra-stimulant, considering it the most efficacious of that class. This seems

36.2 SYPHILIS. On the use of mercury .â€”This remedy was universally em- ployed in England for the care of syphilis, from the remote time of its first introduction into practice to the early years of the present century, under the belief of the disease being constantly progressive, and only to be cured by this treat- ment. That this was general is clear from the opinions which Mr. Abernethy collected from the great surgical au- thorities of London before he published his ' Observations on Diseases resembling the Venereal/ in 1804. All the persons received into the syphilitic wards of the London hospitals were subjected to mercurial treatment, gene- rally by friction, and carried, in most cases, to the extent of salivation. The contaminated and offensive atmosphere insepa- rable from such a course of proceeding fully justified the name of foul wards, which may possibly have been applied to these apartments in the first instance to denote the moral stain implied by the contraction of the complaint. Although this opinion respecting the nature and cure of syphilis was held with undoubting faith in England, and I believe in France also, evidence was slowly arising elsewhere calculated not merely to raise doubts on the subject, but to show that it was altogether unfounded. We learn from Dr. Ferguson that the use of mercury had been almost completely abandoned in Portugal, without any unfavorable result, and British surgeons saw the entire disuse of mercury by their colleagues in charge of foreign troops in the British service in many in- stances during the great war. Mercury, when employed freely and indiscriminately, as it was formerly, and especially in repeated courses, disturbs health so seriously, not without suspicion of aggravating the disease, that surgeons at various times have turned their attention to the discovery of some other treatment by winch the symptoms might be more safely controlled.

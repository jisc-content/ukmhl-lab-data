234 INCISED WOUNDS. The uniting medium, which first agglutinates, assumes the nature of the structure in which it is deposited, and the part is restored to its former state and functions, as is seen in skin, muscle, tendon. The power of a nerve, lost by its divi- sion, returns when the continuity of the cord is restored. This union by adhesion is observed, not only in simple divi- sion, but where parts have been nearly detached, as in flaps of scalp, an ear or finger almost separated. In all such cases union may be accomplished, if very slight connection only remains 5 there is even some evidence that portions of skin entirely separated have become adherent. The power of union by adhesion is illustrated by the surgical proceed- ings for the restoration of lost or mutilated parts, and by animal engraftings. The practice of making what have been called artificial noses, but in reality that of transplanting a portion of in- tegument from the arm to the face, was carried on at Tropea, in Calabria Oltra, in the 15th century, by a family named Boiani. Two Sicilian surgeons, father and son, named Branca, were celebrated in the art at the end of the 15th century. Tagliacozzi, professor at Bologna, who had learned the process from the Calabrian operators, practised it, and has described it at great length, in his elaborate folio of 300 pages, fDe Curtorum Insitione per Chirurgiam,' with numerous plates, 1597. The noses made by Tagliacozzi were seen by many of his contemporaries, who have attested the facts. He also made ears and lips. A statue was erected to him at Bologna, in which he is represented holding a nose in the hand. He pared away the callous edge of the cicatrix, raised a flap of skin of proper size and form, from the arm or forearm, leaving it connected at the part intended to form the top of the nose, bound the arm to the head, then fastened

212 MOKTIFICATION. are in great measure ossified, or, as some contend, calcified. The earthy matter, which is phosphate of lime, is deposited in variety of forms and of extent, generally in thin plates or scales, first, perhaps, in the internal or serons coat, bnt uVU- mately involving the whole substance of the vessel. At first small and distinct, they increase in size, and come nearer together, so as to occupy the whole tube for a considerable extent. They may convert the vessel into a completely hard and rigid canal. The deposit sometimes encroaches on the cavity lo as to lessen or entirely obstruct the calibre. This state of the arteries, which must lessen the quantity of blood received by a part, and interfere with its proper trans- mission, may be found in the healthiest persons, who have attained great age, and led regular lives, and may manifest its injurious influence in them; occurring at an earlier age and in unsound constitutions, it cannot fail to be more hurtful. Our knowledge of this disease as a cause of gangrene is almost confined to the lower limbs. In a patient under my eare in St. Bartholomew's, in whom a great toe had been slowly yielding to the malady during some months, I found the radial artery on both sides hard and pulseless. The late Baron Dupuytren contended that spontaneous gangrene of the lower extremities arises, not from ossification of the blood-vessels of the part, which he regarded merely as a casual coincidence, but from inflammation of the femoral artery, causing effusion into the tube, and its consequent obstruction. According to my experience, these cases of arteritis are extremely rare; and the very small number that I have seen, have been in younger persons than those attacked by the usual form of spontaneous gangrene. They have been attended by unequivocal evidences of dis- order in the course of the main artery, from which the

MELANOSISâ€”SKIN. 615 painful. The surface may be fretted, by rubbing of dress, into a sore, with painful and occasionally bleeding fungus, and then with melanotic degeneration. This is followed by secondary swellings in the neighbourhood, and gradually in important internal organs, with inevitably fatal termination. I saw a case during life, and witnessed the examination after death under the care of Mr. LangstafF, who has given a detailed account of it in the third volume of the f Medico- Chirurgical Transactions/ It began in a large mole on the shoulder, which had swelled and become troublesome, being of dark, bluish-red colour, and about three quarters of an inch in circumference.

Two tumours had formed in the axilla, and rapidly increased after the operation, forming at last a swelling which weighed four pounds after death. Four other tumours formed in different parts, one in the neighbourhood of the inguinal glands. The integuments of the great axillary swelling became very thin, and sloughed, giving issue to dark blood and ichor. Protuberances of the surface had been occasionally punc- tured, with more or less copious escape of dark blood, and great relief. No pain was complained of for a considerable time, but it came on gradually and increased to the severest suffering, consisting of excruciating and darting sensations in the swelling, in the side of the neck, and along the arms, under which life sometimes seemed to be giving way. Death occurred at the end of five months. The external surface of the swelling was an aggregation of dark-coloured tumours, varying in size, but not large. Some of these consisted of soft medullary substance like brain, with coagulated blood, others of the same consistence but dark gray, and a few were blackish. The fluid expressed from the latter was like the black

The skin is so thin in some individuals that the course and ramifications of the subjacent vessels, and the colour of the contained blood, are quite discernible. The upper lip is thick, the eyelids red, the muscular flesh soft and flaccid. These circumstances are more or less observable in scrofulous subjects; but it is not so easy to explain the nature of that peculiarity which we designate as the scrofulous constitution, diathesis, or disposi- tion.

Each individual has something peculiar to himself in feature, form, corporeal and mental endowments. Some of these diversities are found in different degrees in so large a number of persons as to admit of their being grouped to-

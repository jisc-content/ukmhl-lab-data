PEIMARY SORES. 403 the cure of these sores, I have already had occasion to explain, having shown that it has been proved by the clearest evidence that all forms of the venereal disease may get well without its use. An exception must be made to this statement in respect to phagedaena, both acute and chronic. The prepuce or the glans might be lost by withholding the use of mercury in these affections. The next question is, whether it abridges the duration of the complaint; and on this point the evidence is contra- dictory. I know that it was the opinion of Mr. Rose, whose name I have mentioned as having commenced in this country those important investigations that have thrown so much light on the nature and treatment of the venereal disease, that, although primary sores can be cured without mercury, the cure occupies a longer time. Mr. Guthrie acknowledged that the primary venereal sores treated without mercury at the York Hospital, were tedious, frequently running on to six, eight, ten, and twenty, and even in one case to twenty-six weeks, healing and relapsing. He thought that the protracted cases would have got well in one half or one third of the time under mercury. Others have stated that the sores treated without mercury got well the soonest. I allude particularly to some comparative trials made in the English army. A report was made by Sir James M'Grigor then Director-General of the Army Medical Board, and by Sir William Franklin, that, in 1940 cases of primary venereal sores, treated without mercury, in the course of two years the average time required for the cure was twenty-one days when there were sores without bubo, and forty-five days when bubo co-existed with sores. During the same period 2827 cases of primary sores were treated with mercury and they occupied, on an average, thirty-three days when without bubo, and fifty days when complicated with bubo In a

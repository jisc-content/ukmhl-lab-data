HYDEOPHOBIA. 265 The only hope of safety, then, is in prevention, and the interval between the bite and the outbreak of the symptoms affords a favorable opportunity for accomplishing this object. As the fluid poison causing the mischief is introduced into a wound, it would seem, on first view, a natural and easy course to remove it by careful ablution. If this should, be attempted in the first instance, before excision can be resorted to, it should be carried into effect systematically and with perse- verance. Tepid water (about 90) should be poured in a con- tinuous stream out of a tea-kettle from a height of four or five feet, on the wound, exposed as openly as possible. If the wound should have penetrated, a smaller stream may be directed against it forcibly, by means of a strong syringe. These attempts might be continued for some hours. Escharotics have been applied to the wound, and even the actual cautery has been used.- We can hardly doubt that if the mild lunar caustic were effectually rubbed on all the surfaces to which the tooth of the animal has reached, especially after careful ablution, that the patient would be safe. Still, as pointed teeth may have penetrated deeply, and parts may be considerably lacerated, some uncertainty must remain. It is recorded that hydrophobia supervened in a youth from wound of the face, where caustic had been applied to the parts at the time of the accident, by Mr. Hunter. The only measure on which we can rely with perfect con- fidence for placing the patient in safety, is complete excision of all the wounded parts. This may be preceded by careful ablution, if the wound should be lacerated, irregular, and penetrating. Previous examination with the probe will show how far the injury has reached, and we must carry the knife still further, rather going beyond than falling short of what may seem absolutely necessary. Immediate excision is not necessary j it may be performed

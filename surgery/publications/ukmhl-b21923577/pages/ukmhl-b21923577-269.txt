QUESTION OF AMPUTATION. 2 fc9 which are answered by Mr. Pott, with his usual clearness and good sense in his ' Remarks on the Necessity and Pro- priety of Amputation in certain cases and under certain circumstances/ in which he has also pointed out the proper time for its performance. (Works, vol. iii.) The cases in which amputation should be performed may be brought under a few heads : 1 and 2. When joints are traversed by balls, with exposure of the articulation and shattering of the articular extremities. Serious wounds of the limbs, particularly the thigh and leg, in their continuity, with extensive laceration and contusion, comminuted or splintered fracture, probably extending in the latter case to the next joint. The last three quarters of a century have afforded the most ample opportunities of observation and experience in this important part of surgery, in all its varieties of situation and extent, and the practical conclusions from this mass of evidence have been well summed up by M. Velpeau, in his 1 Medecine Operatoire/ torn, i, to the following effect: " In gunshot injuries of joints, with considerable mischief, there is no doubt respecting the propriety of amputating. The difference of opinion among practitioners regards the cases where the joint is not largely opened, the osseous ex- tremities having been simply traversed or broken by the ball. The circumstances must be taken into the account. If the patient can receive all necessary care and attention, supposing a ball to have simply traversed the wrist, elbow, ankle, or shoulder, breaking the articular extremities without lacerating the tendons and soft parts, the preservation of the limb should be attempted. On the contrary, in the tumult of camps in crowded hospitals, when destructive epidemics prevail,, if the patient can neither be^ kept quiet, nor receive the re- quisite care, if the fracture is splintered, the ligaments,

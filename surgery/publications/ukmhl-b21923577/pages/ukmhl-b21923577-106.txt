86 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. circumstances which first required the depletion. We can point out no one circumstance to guide us in this matter, as we could not lay down any single indication for resorting to it originally. The inflammatory state of the blood, in conjunction with the local symptoms, may authorise us to repeat venesection to a much smaller amount than in the first instance. If local inflammation is accompanied by febrile constitu- tional disturbance, the digestive organs being disordered, and the secretions suspended or diminished, we find that when the secretions are restored, and the alimentary canal begins to act, the fever is diminished or cured. It is said that the fever is removed by the restoration of the secretions and of the functions of the alimentary canal. Perhaps it might be more correct to say that the secretions return, and the digestive organs are improved, because the fever is abated. However, assuming the first supposition, some persons say, Â« Do not bleed! Give opening medicines, and diaphoretics. Act on the bowels and skin, and you will thus get rid of the fever." Two, four, or more days, are often consumed m fruitless efforts of this kind; purgatives are given which do not purge, diaphoretics which do not diminish the heat and dryness of skin. The local disturbance increases; the general disorder gets worse and worse. Relief comes at last rather by the efforts of nature than as the result of medical means. The treatment by direct depletion appears to great advantage when contrasted with this mode of proceeding, and shows us that the state of the skin and bowels may he immediately influenced through the circulation. Take away blood, and your objects are accomplished at once. When you have thus relieved the circulation from the load which

TUMOURS. 591 the patient consented, and took a lodging near London; the day was fixed and the surgeon attended. He was probably alarmed by the state of the patient, and postponed further proceedings until a consultation should be held on the case. Sir Everard Home, Messrs. Cline and Abernethy, who met him on the occasion, were unanimous in the opinion that the disease was malignant, and that an operation would be hopeless. The patient returned to his residence in the countiy, under what seemed equivalent to a sentence of death, and determined in his despair to see Sir David Dundas of Richmond, an excellent practitioner of long expe- rience, who had seen him originally, and did not think quite so badly of the case, not regarding it as desperate. He also requested the attendance of Sir W. Blizard and myself in consultation on his case. We found a large tumour on the inside, and rather to the front of the left thigh, a little above the knee; it was of bright red colour and had an elastic feel. There was a firm, indolent tumour, as large as an egg, deeply seated at the back of the pelvis, and a similar one in the back near the spine; one as large as a nut in the left eyebrow; while several small knots could be felt under the skin in various parts of the body. He was worn down by the irritation of this disease and entire want of rest to the greatest degree of weakness, excessively emaciated, with rapid and feeble pulse, and profuse fetid perspiration. The case seemed to me perfectly hopeless; Sir W. Blizard, who thought that a very slight chance of benefit was offered by removal of the limb, amputated high up two days afterwards. The patient was immediately relieved from the more serious and distressing symptoms, and eventually got well, remaining in a fair state of health, though subject to irregular and often severe pains of nervous character, sensitive to external in- fluences, and obliged to manage himself very cautiously.

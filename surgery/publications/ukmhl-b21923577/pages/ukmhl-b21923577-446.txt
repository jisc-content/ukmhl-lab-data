426 SECONDARY SYPHILIS BONES. necks of the teeth, of grayish phagedenic character, with great pain, is occasionally seen. Syphilitic disease of bones and joints.-^ give the name of node (Latin, nodus, a knot or knob) to a partial enlarge- ment of a hone, which may he a disease of the bony sub- stance or of the periosteum, the cases being, therefore, dis- tinguished as osseous and periosteal. In the former case the swelling is of incompressible hardness, while the latter, although firm to the feel, yields a little to pressure. On a long bone such as the tibia, it will be about two or three inches in length, but it may be longer; there may be more than one and nearly the whole shaft is sometimes occupied by an irregular enlargement. The progress of the disease is slow, attended with aching pain during its development, after which there may not be much suffering while the patient is at rest in the day, but it becomes extremely painful m bed, so as to prevent rest, the pain going off in the morning. It is most frequent in the bones which, being thinly covered, are the most exposed to external influences. This is partx- cularly observable in the tibia and cranium, also m the clavicle The lower end of the radius and the upper portion of the ulna suffernot infrequently, and other bones may be affected in rare instances. Cranial nodes are generally, bu not invariably, attended with suppuration, and thus are soft to the feel; active inflammation and suppuration may occur in those on the tibia, and partial necrosis of the bone or caries may ensue. This result is sometimes seen iathe cranium. The swelling of the periosteum subsides under proper treatment; the bony node becomes quiet, but the enlargement generally remains in a greater or less deg e. The shaft of the bone is sometimes the seat of pam, even m a severe degree, without any enlargement. I have heard the opinion expressed, and seen it stated in

SLOUGHING PHAGEDENA. 197 morning, with quiet pulse, good appetite, and cheerful coun- tenance. On the separation of the eschar, after a few days, a perfectly healthy granulating surface is disclosed, which heals rapidly. Strict attention to cleanliness and dryness of sur- rounding parts is necessary throughout, and the complaint thus ends without leaving hehind any liability to further mischief. I once saw a formidable case of sloughing phagedsena entirely independent of venereal affection. A female between twenty and thirty was reduced to a condition of extreme weakness by a severe attack of smallpox followed by diar- rhoea and excoriation, which had caused a large and deep sloughy excavation in each buttock. She recovered under the use of the acid with all the means, both dietetic and medical, calculated to restore and maintain general power. The question of contagion naturally presents itself to the mind in viewing this serious disease, and the unpleasant secretion which accompanies it. That the discharge does not affect the sound skin of the patient is clearly seen from the way in which it has been applied to nearer and more remote parts of the body before admission into an hospital. It would, therefore, probably not affect the skin of a healthy person; and hospital nurses have never been injured by it, so far as I know. Does it contaminate the atmosphere so as to act injuriously on previously healthy sores in patients occupying contiguous beds or lying in the same ward ? We entertain suspicion that it has such influence, and act on the opinion by keeping patients who labour under the affection as far apart from others as possible. In Hospital Gangrene, (Pourriture d'hopital), there is a state of sore occurring under certain circumstances in hospitals and analogous situations, so similar in some respects to the preceding affection, that it has been described under the same

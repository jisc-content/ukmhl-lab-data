232 INCISED WOUNDS. tific a process. As the edges of wounds, when thus approxi- mated, quickly stick together, we call the process union by adhesion, which is exactly equivalent to Galen's expression, " per primam intentionem," or the French phrase of " re- union immediate." This simple method of treating wounds, according to the dictates of common sense, appears to great advantage in comparison with the precepts and practice of the learned, who have' laid down the rules of art on the subject, prescribing a cumbrous and complicated mode of dressing, including variety of ointments, pledgets, masses of lint or charpie, compresses and bandages. This course, which has been obsolete in England for the last three quarters of a century, still flourishes in all its complexity throughout a great part of the Continent. The explanation of the process by which wounds are thus healed, is that the surface of the wound soon becomes covered by a closely adhering substance, which in appear- ance and other properties exactly resembles the fibrine of the blood. This fibrine, of which Dr. John Thomson* found, in experiments on animals, a distinct layer covering the wounds he bad made within less than four hours after they had been inflicted, agglutinates the sides of the wound, making them adhere so effectually that at the end of ten or twelve hours they cannot be separated without force. This medium of union is soon penetrated with blood-vessels, and thus becomes organized. The shortest time within .which this organization can be accomplished has not been ascer- tained, but simple wounds are often found firmly healed at the end of two or three days. The medium of union must be poured out by the capillaries of the part; it cannot be an effusion from divided vessels, as it is effected most advan- tageously when the wound is perfectly dry before being closed. * ' Lectures on Inflammation,3 p. 209.

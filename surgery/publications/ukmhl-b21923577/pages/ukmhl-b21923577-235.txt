TREATMENT. 215 3. To favour the separation of the mortified part, and, in certain cases, to accomplish that separation by a surgical operation. 1. The means of prevention differ, according to the nature of the case. They include proper treatment of inflammations, and judicious management of frostbitten parts. 2. The practice formerly prevailed, and is not altogether obsolete, of attempting to stop the progress of mortification by various warm and stimulating applications considered to have the power of preserving and restoring the heat of the part, or by others supposed to be capable of preventing putrefaction, and therefore called antiseptics; for instance, spirits of wine, turpentine, balsams, camphor, bark, yeast and beer in poultice. These substances prevent or retard putrefaction in dead animal matter, and they have been em- ployed in mortification on this false analogy. The appli- cation of conclusions drawn from the action of certain matters on dead textures, to the employment of these agents on the living frame, are equally false in physiology and logic. Alcohol, oil of turpentine, and camphor, may have some effect in lessening the fetor of the mortified parts; but their stimulating action on the living structures, already too highly excited, would, in most instances, hasten instead of retarding the progress of mortification. For the purpose of correcting fetor the best applications are charcoal and the chlorides of lime and soda. Finely powdered charcoal absorbs the noxious and offensive effluvia of dead and living animal matter as well as carbonic acid gas, and is thus employed with advantage in places where animal decay is going on. A bread poultice, with admixture of powdered charcoal in sufficient quantity to make it quite black, is one of the best applications, not only in many cases

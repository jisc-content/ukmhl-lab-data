202 MORTIFICATION, instances an effectual preservative against the spontaneous alterations, or those caused by surrounding influences, which constitute putrefaction. Mortification, gangrene, sphacelus, are used indifferently, and may be regarded as synonymous terms, yet there are shades of difference. Mortification is the more general expression. Gangrene is generally applied to external and superficial mortification. Sphacelus to the death of an entire part or limb. Dr I Thomson proposed to restrict the term gangrene to the state of transition from inflammation to mortification. But no such state, independent of inflammation on the one side and of mortification on the other, can be defined; nor could we hope to give a new meaning to a word so commonly employed in a clearly understood sense, both by ancients and moderns. The dead part is ealled in English a dough; and the pro- cess generally, slonghing. The separated cuticle or cast-skm of the snake is called its slough, which is an old Anglo-Saxon "Regarding mortification, then, as the death of a part in the sense already specified, the question presents rtself, wflatrs the IMBg action necessary to produce the pecuflar change of structure constituting mortification T Is it Docs inflammation always precede?

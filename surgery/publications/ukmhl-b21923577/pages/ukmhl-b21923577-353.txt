GOUT. 333 at first slight, become more considerable, and the disease gradually increases to its full development. It remains for some time in full activity, then gradually declines, goes off, and leaves the patient without liability to future attacks. In rheumatic inflammation, on the contrary, the affection appears suddenly in a decided form. The joint is swelled, painful, and becomes at once inflamed. Soon after it has appeared in one joint, it may show itself in another. It may suddenly cease in the part first affected, and appear elsewhere. It may return to the first part. The patient will be liable to future attacks. But the sudden development of the disease, its sudden and abrupt cessation, its extension to other joints, its affecting several of them at the same time, and its in- fluence in exciting pericarditis, particularly characterise rheumatic inflammation. In gouty inflammation, the disease, as in the rheumatic, exhibits its full character at the first onset. The commence- ment of the attack is characterised by pain in the part, in- creasing to a severe degree, and then gradually declining. There are paroxysms of acute pain in its severest forms; these, after a time, diminish in intensity, and then disappear. Here, as in rheumatism, the complaint often abruptly ceases in one part, and extends to others, while those first affected may suffer again. Thus gouty inflammation is irregular in its course ; it shifts to other joints, and there is great probability, almost amounting to a certainty, of future seizures. After repeated attacks of gouty and rheumatic inflammation, the joints pass into a condition of chronic enlargement, with stiff- ness, and even complete loss of motion, with depositions of lithic acid compounds in the case of gout. In the case, then of common inflammation, we have only to consider the deve- lopment of disease in the part, consequent on a local cause. But in rheumatic or gouty cases there is the local tnflam-

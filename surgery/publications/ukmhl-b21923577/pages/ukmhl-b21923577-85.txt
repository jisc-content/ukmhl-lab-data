ITS EFFECTS AND VARIETIES. 65 altered secretion is a striking feature; and interstitial depo- sition, with swelling and change of structure is greater. If we contrast the changes i^ the testicle affected with acute inflammation as in some cases of hernia humoralis, with those of more chronic nature, producing that morbid enlarge- ment called by the older surgeons sarcocele, or with the venereal disease of the same gland, we shall find that in the latter there is permanently organized new matter, as may be proved by injection. So, likewise, in the adventitious mem- branes lining the dura mater. They are true inflammatory effusions, as I have seen in many of the examinations which I have performed at Bethlehem Hospital. Thus, in acute inflammation there is violent but temporary disturbance; the part soon regains its natural state. In chronic, with apparently slighter disorder, we find greater and more permanent change of structure, often impairing or destroying function. The danger in the two cases, as regards the part, and the difficulty in treatment, are in an inverse ratio to the severity of the symptoms and apparent ground of alarm. The violent disturbance of acute inflammation is easily stopped; to re- move or check the disorganizing effects of chronic is'a work of greater difficulty and longer time. Acute and chronic stage. We use the terms acute and chronic stage not only to mark differences which are observed originally and through the whole course of the inflammation but also to denote a corresponding difference in degree of vio' lence in different periods of one and the same inflammation " An inflammation is not an uniform disturbance throughout- the part goes through different states between the be«rbnin- and the termination of the affection. The ,™ntn & & , symptoms, com- mcncing m slighter form, proceed gradually to their full intensity, then there is a stationary period in which all the 5

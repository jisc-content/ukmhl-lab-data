In an acute attack there may be severe pain in the globe and head; but in a milder degree, which is the most common, there is kttle or no pain during the day, while it comes on at night, interfering with and often preventing rest. Vision is dull at the begin- ning, becoming more and more imperfect, until in severe cases it is lost for the time. Some intolerance of light with lacrymation is experienced at first, but soon goes off. The disease begins on the pupillary margin, occupies the inner circle of the iris, on which a stratum of reddish-brown fibrme is sometimes poured out j it extends more or less rapidly to the circumference, and then through the ciliary body to the posterior tissues. To this extension, which render the disease of the organ more general than the term iritis indi- cates, the impaired vision must be referred. When m a mild form, the complaint may go through its course and recover with slight change in the pupil, not injurious to vision. It may cause contraction of the pupil and its closure by an adventitious membrane, and more or less disorganization of the iris, with complete loss of sight. In rare instances lymph is effused behind the iris, and in such quantity as to cause a bulging of the sclerotic and conjunctiva. The fibrme thus effused may pass through the pupil into the anterior chamber In the few instances which I have seen of this aftection vision has been completely lost, although the inflammation has yielded to treatment. slmti, affections of * tkroat, ~* - There is an excavated nicer of the tonerl, gene ally on both rides, as if a portion had heen scooped ont; the sor^ grayish or dirty white, sometimes termed lardaceons.

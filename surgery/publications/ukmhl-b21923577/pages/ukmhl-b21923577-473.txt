CLINICAL LECTURE. 453 all other forms of disease. Thus, we should expect to find the great pox as* definite in appearance and course as the smallpox or cowpox. Again, it is represented that other morbid phenomena, apparently produced in the same manner as this supposed regular syphilitic disease, are not venereal, do not result from the application of a poison, and require a different mode of treatment from true syphilis. When, on the contrary, we look over the several cases presented to our observation in a large hospital, we see affec- tions very different from each other in appearance, and in other essential characters, yet coming under the common denomination of venereal disorders. Different as these are, they seem all to arise from a common source; they owe their origin to promiscuous sexual intercourse, and are, therefore, justly denominated venereal. I know no reason why any one of these varieties should be called true syphilis rather than any other. We may, therefore, abandon the attempt to distinguish between syphilis and the diseases resembling it, and discard from our vocabulary the terms true syphilis and pseudo-syphilis, and the others founded on the hypothesis just noticed; terms which have either no clear meaning or an erroneous one, and are only calculated to introduce confusion and obscurity into a subject sufficiently difficult in itself. If then, you wish to learn the nature of syphilis, dismiss from your minds the speculations of authors, and observe the phenomena, progress, and treatment of the venereal cases in this hospital. I now direct your attention to the case of William Smith a tailor, m Lazarus Ward, who has already been in the hos' pital more than once. This is a well-marked example of phagedenic venereal disease, and it shows a correspondence m character between the primary affection and its secondary or constitutional consequences.

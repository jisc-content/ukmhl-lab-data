TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 93 stimuli with caution. Beef tea; arrow-root, with a little wine; Spirit. Ammon. Aromat. More remote effects.—Gradual exhaustion, and death; exhaustion, followed by reaction; increased frequency of pulse, after large bleedings. Pulse not only more frequent, but throbbing and bound- ing; palpitation and increased action of heart; throbbing of the carotids; beating in the head; severe headache, with sounds of hammering or beating. These, which are effects of the loss of blood, may be mistaken, and sometimes are, for indications of further depletion; these symptoms are, indeed, relieved by syncope, and thus are benefited, for the moment, by loss of blood; but they return in an aggravated form. General paleness of surface; blanched, waxy whiteness of countenance.* Cold to the head; perhaps a few leeches to the temples. Nourishment and light stimuli. Beef tea; arrow-root, with brandy; ammonia; hyoscyamus; perhaps opium, with cor- dials. If it should be necessary to act on the bowels, clys- ters or mild and warm aperients. Purgatives.—Bleeding directly accomplishes the primary indication in the treatment of inflammation, that of lessen- ing the disturbance of the vascular system. It is not, however, sufficient to diminish the quantity of circulating fluids in this way; we must prevent the introduction of fresh supplies, by the employment of purgatives, and by regulating the diet, or rather enjoining abstinence. Active purgatives are of use to remove whatever is con- tained in the stomach and bowek, to clear out the alimentary canal, a proceeding which affords great relief. * More full account of these injurious effects of loss of blood, with illustra- tive cases, are found in Dr. Marshall Hall's book on the 'Morbid and Curative Effects of the Loss of Blood.'

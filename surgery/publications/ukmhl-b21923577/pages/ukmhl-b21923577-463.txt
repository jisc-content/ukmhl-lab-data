SYPHILIS IN INFANTS. 443 I have seen cases of infants in the first and second year, with pupils contracted and closed by adventitious membrane and total loss of sight, in whom the affection had been probably syphilitic. The child of a gentleman who had had primary sores before marriage became affected a few weeks after birth with eruption all over the body; it wasted, and seemed on the point of dying, but recovered by the use of mercury in small doses. In a few weeks more severe inflammation of the eyes came on, which was arrested by mercury in small doses, but the child became blind. When I saw it, several weeks afterwards, one pupil was fixed, with an opaque membrane behind it. The other pupil was clear, but without motion, and the child was blind. I have seen one instance in which the vascular surface on which the nail rests was inflamed in all the toes of both feet, more particularly in the great toes. There was dis- charge of yellow matter, drying and hardening under the loose edges of the nails, and raising them, the nails them- selves exhibiting a lightish-brown discoloration. Separation of the entire nail occurred only on one of the great toes, leaving a raw surface, which soon healed. It was the case of a healthy infant, about eight months old. The disease yielded -slowly to the use of the Hydrarg. c. Creta. The remedy was discontinued rather prematurely, when a relapse of the dis- ease took place, and a very slight discoloration of the finger- nails of both hands was observed. Permanent cure was effected by repetition of the treatment, which did not disturb the health. An attack of syphilis in the usual form, but not severe, had occurred in this case before I saw the infant The treatment of these cases is simple and successful The disease yields readily and quickly to mercury, which these young subjects bear very well. Three grains of the Hydrar* c Creta, a grain, or half a grain of calomel, may be given

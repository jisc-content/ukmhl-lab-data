FEVER. 141 oppressed state of the brain which diminishes voluntary power. This has sometimes led to the injudicious use of tonics and stimuli. Bark and wine will not remove the sen- sorial congestion, from which the want of muscular power proceeds. When, however, the complaint is protracted, and the power of the system failing, with small and weak pulse, tonics and cordials with wine must be resorted to, their effect being carefully watched. This treatment is employed for a temporary purpose, to rouse the nagging powers: when the patient rallies, it may be proper to lessen or withdraw the stimulus. The patient is not to go on continuously with wine or brandy, without careful attention being paid to the state of the circulation. Under the name of irritative fever, a state has been described which is not essentially distinguished from this nervous or typhoid kind of sympathetic fever. We see this â–  m a serious injury, such as a compound fracture which goes on badly, which is in fact incurable, where the powers of the system have been exhausted by extensive and continued in- flammation and suppuration, while the local irritation still proceeds, and the febrile disturbance is still kept up. Thus it is high action in a weakened frame, where the powers of recovery, both local and general, are failing. Fever excited by local injury or disease may be inter- mittent : you may have a regular paroxysm of ague.

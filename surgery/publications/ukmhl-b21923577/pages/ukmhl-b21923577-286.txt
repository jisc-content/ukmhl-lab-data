May it he practised with preventive effect at any period hetween the receipt of the wound and the commencement of hydrophohia? that is, does the poison stay in the part ? On that point we are absolutely ignorant, and there is little prospect of our arriving at certainty on the subject. High authorities have directly asserted that excision of the wounded parts at any time before the occurrence of symptoms will be effectual in preventing the attack. No sufficient evidence can be pro- duced to support this dictum, which is involved in uncertainty by the very circumstances of the case. Of many persons bitten by one and the same dog or wolf, several die, while some escape who have taken no more precaution than those who died. If excision at a remote period had been performed in these fortunate cases, it would have had the credit of saving them. A gentleman was under my care who had been bitten on the thumb and hand by a dog, to whom no suspicion attached at the time. He employed water dressing, and left the country, where the accident had occurred, for London. The dog, which was soon discovered to be ill, died of hydrophobia, and I excised the injured parts at the end of the fourth day. There was no subsequent illness. I cannot lay much stress on this case, as the wounds, though not inconsiderable, were superficial, so that any poisonous matter might have been washed from them by the water which was applied plentifully from the beginning. Mr. Travers has published in the second volume of his work on < Constitutional Irritation/ p. 410, the following communi- cation from Mr. Hodgson : '< The efficacy of excision of the bitten part at any period before the accession of symptoms, is illustrated by the following fact, which occurred in my own practice. A dog on the same day bit a child, and subsequently

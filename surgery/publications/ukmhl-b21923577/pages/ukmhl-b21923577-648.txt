628 MELANOSIS. its vessels are large and tortuous. The development of this tumour above the eye has pushed the globe downwards and outwards. When the lids are separated by voluntary effort, the palpebral aperture is entirely occupied by the morbid growth. On depressing the lower lid, the cornea is brought into view quite transparent, but pushed down to the very lowest part of the orbit. The iris is unaltered, and pressed against the cornea, together with the lens, which is dis- colored and opaque. Vision in the opposite eye is perfect; appetite good; no disease is apparent in any other part. The history of the case, with the appearances just detailed, left no doubt that melanotic disease had formed within the eye, and had made its way through the coats at the upper part of the organ, so as to constitute the dark tumour which projected between the lids. Extirpation of the diseased organ offered the only prospect of benefit. January 11th.â€”The operation was performed in the usual manner. There was some trouble in separating the upper lid, which was tightly stretched over the tumour, but the globe was satisfactorily removed. The cut surface of the optic nerve presented a dark discoloration in slender streaks j as it had been cut through close to the sclerotica, it was thought advisable to take out another portion. Some dis- coloration was noticed in the situation of the second division. There was no bleeding of consequence; no vessels were tied; wet lint was placed over the orbit, and the patient was carried to bed. Upon making a vertical section of the eye and tumour, it was found that a morbid growth, of soft consistence, and brownish colour, with black portions interspersed, had pro- ceeded from between the sclerotica and choroid in front of the optic nerve, and pushing forwards the iris, which was healthy, and the lens, which was opaque, against .the cornea, bad made

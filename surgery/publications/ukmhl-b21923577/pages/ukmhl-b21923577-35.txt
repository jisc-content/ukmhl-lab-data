MODE OF STUDY. 15 watch patients; you must observe the origin and progress of the altered functions during life, and then investigate, after death, the changes produced in the organization. Here your knowledge of anatomy and physiology will be of the greatest service. How can you appreciate the effect of disease, unless you know the healthy structure? How can you refer the altered functions or symptoms to the organic changes which have produced them, especially in internal organs, unless you know the healthy functions ? The general doctrines of disease and treatment can only be judged by the lights of anatomy and physiology; the greater portion of medical theories is obviously unable to bear this scrutiny, and may be at once dismissed. The wards of an hospital are the best school of medicine; and clinical study, under the guidance of a competent teacher, is the best mode of learning. You will immediately inquire whether it is not necessary to hear lectures and read books before you begin to see patients. I advise you to resort as early as possible to nature, to that source from which the masters of our art have derived their information; from which lecturers and authors must draw their knowledge. Here it may be said with perfect truth Juvat integros acce- dere fontes atque haurire. In learning anatomy, you have the facts demonstrated to you by the teacher, and you examine and explore them for yourselves by dissection. In the same way, demonstration of the phenomena of disease on the patient by the teacher, and the actual observation of them by the learner, are the only means by which real know- ledge of the subject can be acquired. The facts thus pre- sented to the senses make a stronger impression than any lescription, even by the ablest lecturer or writer; while the nformation which a person thus acquires for himself from lature can always be depended on, and is never forgotten.

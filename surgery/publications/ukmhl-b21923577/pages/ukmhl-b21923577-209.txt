ULCERATION. 189 Treatment.â€”The effect of position on the return of venous blood, which has been already adverted to, is plainly seen in the arm or leg, according as the limb passes from the horizontal to the vertical position in the state of health. The influence is still more manifest in disease; an inflamed finger swells, reddens, and becomes throbbing and painful when the limb is held down; these symptoms cease on raising the arm above the head. It seems a natural inference that a person labouring under an ulceration of the leg should keep the limb and body in the horizontal position. This is sometimes necessary, and may be said, speaking abstractly, to be most favorable to the healing process. Confinement to bed, however, weakens both the limb and the body, damaging health more or less seriously, and an ulcer healed in that way will surely break out again when ordinary occu- pations are resumed. Pressure acts powerfully in aiding the return of venous blood and giving strength to the limb, when the vessels are distended and enlarged, and the part is gene- rally swollen. Exertion of the part in such a state brings on heat, pain, and increased swelling; a well-applied bandage prevents this mischief, and enables the patient to use the part with comparative ease. The principal means of treat- ment in such cases must therefore be the use of pressure, which may be applied to the entire limb, to the part in which the ulcer is seated, or in both ways. The part of the limb in which the ulcer is placed and two or three inches below and above it should be inclosed with strips of plaster about two inches wide, long enough to go round with two or three inches over, beginning from below and going upwards, each succeeding strip covering one third of that im- mediately preceding. As the resin contained in the adhesive plaster may irritate the skin, the emplastrum plumbi is pre-

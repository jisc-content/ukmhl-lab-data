ITS NATURE AND SYMPTOMS. 55 alterations are we do not know. It is not simply increased vascular activity; that would produce increased nutrition, augmentation of natural bulk or secretions, as in the annual reproduction of the stag's horn, in the swelling of the gravid uterus and of the breasts of suckling women. Thus the seat of inflammation is in the capillaries, those vessels which are the agents of nutrition, growth, secretion, and excretion, which perform all the active business of the animal economy. We do not yet know what differences of structure and action produce all the varied results of vascular exertion; how the capillaries of one part form bone, those of another muscle ; why some secrete bile, others mucus or urine. Can we, then, be surprised that we do not understand inflammation ? Being unable to assign the exact nature of the change in the part, we are obliged to name and define inflammation from its effects or symptoms. The terms inflammation, phlegmasia, phlogosis, phlegmon, are all derived from the most striking external character, that of increased heat. If we do not yet understand the nature of this frequent, almost universal, and therefore familiar affection, can we be surprised that all attempts at founding nosological distributions on the nature of the several affections have failed ?

ULCERATED STAGE. 509 different forms; the one superficial and slow, with sparing discharge, which inorasts, the other rapid and deeper, with copious secretion. In the former the ulceration may begin with a crack at the bottom of the cutaneous fold; a thin scab forms on a surface which is excoriated and raw; it falls off and is repro- duced, often quietly adhering for a considerable time, without any pain, so that the patient hardly notices what has occurred. Sooner or later this becomes a superficial and painful ulcera- tion. More commonly the ulcerative stage, instead of begin- ning to shew itself at first on the surface of the skin, seems to begin by change in the state of the scirrhous growth. A red or livid roundish prominence arises about the centre of the mass, at first hard, but gradually softening so as to have an elastic feel, the discoloration becomes deeper, and the part softer j it then ulcerates, and a thin ichor runs from it. In a large cancerous breast there may be more than one prominence of this kind. Sooner or later a large chasm may be produced by the combination of ulceration and slough- ing, the latter being superficial and occasionally attended with bleeding; the bottom of the sore is irregular, sometimes with red elevations like granulations or with disorganized ash-coloured portions. The whole surface and parts around are of scirrhous hardness, the edges tumid and everted. Thus, though ulcerative destruction is going on in the centre, can- cerous disease is continually advancing in the whole cir- cumference. An ulcer of this kind does not secrete pus, but pours out a bloody, offensive ichor, often in great abundance. The discharge of the superficial ulceration is not fetid, it forms yellowish scabs in the early stage. Indeed, this'su- perficial excoriation has sometimes dried up and healed the scirrhous mass shrinking and lessening, but not dis- appearing.

DIVISIONS OF DISEASE. 33 sation, as cephalalgia, gastrodynia; or the loss of blood or other discharge, as haemoptysis, hsematemesis, hematuria, gonor- . rhoea, leucorrhcea, melasna, diabetes. All these pass in nosology as so many diseases, but they are merely names of symptoms, and thus indicate our ignorance of the true nature of the mischief. Nosology.â€”In a subject so extensive, multifarious, and complicated as medicine, rational arrangement and classifica- tion are of considerable importance. A methodical distribu- tion of parts could not fail to lessen the labour both of learner and teacher. Each of the numerous organs composing the body is liable to be diseased in various ways; and every particular affection of an organ has its name, and is regarded as a disease. In many instances an organ is made up of many component structures, each of which is liable to particular forms of de- rangement, while all of them have received names, and appear in nosologies as diseases. Take the case of the eye. In con- sequence of its being open to external observation, and of its structure being extremely complex, the forms of disease inci- dental to its various structures are sufficiently distinct to have received name3 amounting to some hundreds. You will not therefore be surprised to find that the diseases of the whole body may be made to amount to thousands. The study of disease is not, however, so complicated and endless a subject as this ample catalogue of names would lead you to expect. Although the individual organs of the body are numerous, the component tissues or organic elements of which it is built up are few; the basis or ground-work of nearly all the organs consists of cellular membrane, blood- vessels, absorbents, and nerves. It is the various propor- tions in which these elements are combined that make the differences of the various organs. Hence, as the essential 3

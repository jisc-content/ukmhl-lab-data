DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSIC AND SURGERY. 7 attacked with gouty inflammation of the great toe, in severe pain, and great discomfort, with excited circulation, foul tougue, digestive organs and excretions totally disordered; you remedy the general disturbance, and thus cure the attack, possibly without any application to the part. Another loses the use of an arm and leg, in which you find no change, the source of the mischief is in the brain, to which your treatment must be directed. In many cases, disease origi- nating in one part affects many other organs of the body; and the secondary disease thus produced may attract more attention than the original complaint itself. A person ex- periences an affection of the head, which may be produced by various causes, and, within a short time, the circulating system, the digestive organs, and the secretions, become deranged, aud he is in a state of fever. Another receives an injury; inflammation of the part follows, and soon excites general feverishness. The patient may be said to have a sympathetic fever in both cases, and the general disturbance seems of more consequence than the local cause. Again, although individual organs are numerous, the elements of organic structure are few. The various pro- portions in which they are combined make the difference, as the various combinations of a few letters produce the infinite variety of words. The basis of nearly aU parts consists of the areolar, vascular, absorbent, and nervous structures. Hence, pathological principles are the same for all parts, and, con- sequently, treatment must be similar throughout. When diseases are arranged in any form, you may strike a line through, so as to divide the mass into two halves, give them different names, and caU them distinct branches of science, but they will resemble each other in all essential points : the causes, origin, course, and treatment of the disease compre- hended under each, will be the same.

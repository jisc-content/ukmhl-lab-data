It may begin on the foot; I have seen it on the heel, and once in the middle of the sole.

Sometimes it begins and proceeds with little or no pain. I have seen a large vesicle occupying the entire plantar surface of the last phalanx of the great toe, and in another instance one of similar magnitude on the heel, when the patients were hardly aware that anything was the matter, and yielded unwillingly to the necessity of confine- ment in bed.

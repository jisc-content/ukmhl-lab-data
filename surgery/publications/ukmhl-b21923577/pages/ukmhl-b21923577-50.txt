30 THE NATURE AND which their origin should be referred. Some have regarded the liver as a principal source of disease; while the entire alimentary canal has been viewed in the same light by others. These and similar notions are too partial, and there- fore more or less erroneous. We must, however, observe that, in proportion to the importance of any system of organs, will be the influence which they exercise in exciting disease in other parts. In this point of view, the digestive system, the stomach, the intestinal canal and the subsidiary organs, will have a greater influence in exciting disturbance in other quarters than most other parts. We cannot, however, regard them as the source of all other diseases. The brain may be disturbed primarily by causes of direct action, such as serious and continued study, intense mental application, anxiety, grief, and distress, and it then becomes a powerful source of sympathetic influence in various ways. When we say one part sympathises with another, we merely denote the fact that the affections are nearly coincident, and that the second takes place in consequence of the first; so that the physical is analogous to the moral sense of the term. It does not explain how the influence is produced. The pneumogastric nerves account sufficiently for the reciprocal influences of the stomach and head, while the nervous com- munications in so many parts and the more or less direct con- nexion of all the nerves with the cerebrospinal axis explain any sympathies that might at first sight seem obscure. Many sympathies become intelligible by anatomical connexion and continuity of surface. In examining patients, we have to determine not only what organ of the body is diseased, but also how it is affected; this being a part of the subject still involved in much uncertainty. In the great majority of cases, diseases consist of a disturb-

82 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION, alarming inflammatory disorders of the respiratory apparatus, whether in the throat or chest, by similar attacks of the cranial contents or those of the abdomen. The same course of proceeding, or the use of such local depletion as may be equivalent to general bleeding, may be necessary to prevent injurious changes of structure in parts delicately organized, as the brain, eye, or ear, or where the function is important and requires a perfect state of the structure, as in a large joint or the hand. In the latter case I have often seen the greatest advantage and relief from opening a vein at the elbow. The line of conduct now recommended is most advan- tageous in the early stage of an inflammation, when the local and general symptoms are the most violent, also in the young and robust and in those of full habit, when the local mis- chief and the general disturbance are aggravated and main- tained by general plethora. If we had the means of doing so, it would be useful to lay down clear and fixed rules for determining our choice in all cases between general and local bleeding. The presence of inflammatory fever is an additional reason for the former, while, on the other hand, it would not be absolutely contra- indicated by its absence. It is necessary sometimes to employ active depletion where febrile disturbance of the system is not present. . A stout man, of full habit, about forty, employed in a printing office, chiefly as compositor, had a sudden attack of the retina, with total loss of sight. He was immediately bled from the arm to twenty-six ounces. Cupping on the back of the neck was necessary on the next day, and it was re- peated in two days more. Suitable internal treatment, including the use of mercury, was added after the veneaection, and vision was completely restored in a fortnight.

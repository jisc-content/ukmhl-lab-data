TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 97 to me merely our old acquaintance, antiphlogistic, under a new name. The two terms, so far as I can judge, are precisely- equivalent. It is administered, for this purpose, in the quantity of one or two grains every two or three hours; even oftener. The Italian physicians are said to have carried it to the extent of a scruple or even half a drachm in twenty-four hours. When thus employed, I mean in doses of half a grain to one and even two grains, one or two of the first doses often cause vomiting; afterwards the stomach becomes ac- customed to the remedy, and receives it without repugnance. It sometimes purges, and sometimes sweats, but often, without producing any such effect, it exerts a decided influence in abating the inflammation. The stomach is said to tolerate the remedy more readily when an active inflammation exists, requiring its use. Sometimes every dose causes vomiting, so that we cannot persevere with it. I have exhibited the tartrate of antimony frequently on this plan, and with great advantage, but have not carried the dose beyond two grains. A consideration of the effect which it produces on the skin, in external use, would deter me from introducing it in large quantities into the alimentary canal. It is useful when it vomits, purges, or sweats; but it may also be of service without causing any of these effects. It cannot be regarded as superseding the loss of blood, but it lessens the necessity for repeated venesections' It may be employed with advantage after bleeding, and in cases where, having already resorted to direct de- pletion, we doubt the propriety of its repetition. I have used it principally in inflammations of the chest, in pleu- risy, pneumonia properly so called, and bronchitis, often with great advantage, never with bad effect. In grain-doses it is often very serviceable in the latter case. The followi 7 "ng

207 CAUSES. is, in short, a complete breaking up of the constitution, announcing speedy dissolution. The causes of mortification are numerous and various. The essential nature of the process, under its several forms being a cessation of the vital movements in a part, we see it brought on by various agencies capable of disordering the circulation so as to cause its stoppage. The following are among its obvious external causes. 1. Injury, which must be violent in degree, though it may be limited in extent, and if inflicted in that case on an unim- portant structure, such as a bit of skin covering the tibia in a blow on the shin, is not a matter of consequence. In proportion as the extent of violence and the importance of the parts injured increase, there is greater suffering and danger. The latter reaches its highest degree in severe injury of a limb, where fracture or comminution of bones, with exposure or dislocation of joints, is combined with bruising and lace- ration of soft structures. 2. Pressure by the weight of the body on prominent parts, such as the sacrum and trochanters in long confine- ment to bed, or that of splints and other surgical apparatus. Pressure of bandages, when the limb swells after their application; hence the necessity of caution in using them where inflammation may be expected. They are hardly ever necessary. 3. Contact of animal fluids or solids in peculiar morbid conditions, or in particular states of decomposition. Under the name of malignant pustule, a formidable disease, proceeding rapidly to mortification, is known in the south of Europe, and is described by the writers of France and Italy to whom it seems to be well-known. They speak of it as a local inflammation excited in butchers and others by contact with the blood or other fluids of animals perishing in particular

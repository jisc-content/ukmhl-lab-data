GONOEEHCEAL OPHTHALMIA. 495 rapidly destructive inflammations to which the eye is subject. I have seen two or three instances in which it was brought on by persons labouring under gonorrhoea washing their eyes with their own urine, in obedience to a prevalent notion that the practice is good for sore eyes, and several similar in- stances are recorded. In other and more numerous cases we fail to trace the disease to any direct application of infectious matter to the eye, so that its occurrence must have a consti- tutional origin, the nature of which is not at present under- stood. In this affection vascular congestion, with bright redness of the conjunctiva, swelling of the membrane and of the subconjunctival areolar tissue, are carried to the highest Pomt, producing chemosis and general swelling of the lids with profuse discharge of yellow matter, not distinguishable m appearance from that which comes from the urethra in gonorrhoea. The inflammation quickly extends to the cornea m which it causes sloughing, general or partial; interstitial suppuration, or effusion causing opacity; or extensive ulcera- tion; various immediate effects which ultimately destroy or seriously impair sight. The only prospect of benefit is when the patient is seen in the early stage, especially before the cornea xs injured. Energetic antiphlogistic treatment, with he use of mercury, may stop the progress or lessen the amount of themischief. If the ring of ehemosed conjunctiva could e completely excised before the cornea has uf fered there would be a fair chance of recovery.

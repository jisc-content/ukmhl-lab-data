526 CANCERâ€”TREATMENT. sooner or later in other quarters, and ultimately destroys life. We can have no hesitation in stating that cancer cannot be cured, if that expression be considered to imply either the return of the diseased part to its normal or healthy state, or its passing into a quiet condition, without further influence on health, or liability to other and fatal manifestations of disease. The nearest approach to a cure of cancer is in the very rare cases of old persons, in whom the complaint, indolent throughout, has become quiet, the diseased part still existing, but having shrunk and causing no uneasi- ness; here, however, mischief may at any time arise in some other quarter, or death may ensue from some other complaint. If the preceding view be correct, we shall not be surprised at finding that there are no remedies which have any just claim to be regarded as anti-cancerous. In the last century great faith was reposed in the virtues of hemlock (conium), chiefly in consequence of strong representations by a cele- brated physician of the Vienna school. Its reputation has been long and entirely lost. The late Mr. Carmichael, of Dublin, wrote a book in our time extolling the power of iron in this disease. He gave the carbonate in the usual doses, also an oxyphosphate, which does not appear in the Pharma- copoeia. He also used a phosphate and an arseniate of iron locally in ulcerated cancer, the former as a stimulant and corrective, the latter as an escharotic. The internal use of iron can be of no benefit in scirrhus, and probably would injure health in many instances. It may be of some advan- tage as a tonic in the state of weakness connected with the ulcerated period of the disease. The late Mr. John Pearson recommended a reduced regimen, approaching nearly to starvation, as a means of checking the progress of cancer. We can readily believe

146 SUPPUKATION. the abscess, beyond which we find the parts in their natural condition. In the early stage of an abscess the collection of matter is small, and it is surrounded by a large mass of firm substance; in the progress of suppuration the quan- tity of matter increases, and the surrounding hardness diminishes. The sac of the abscess consists of the cellular substance or other soft parts condensed by the effusion of fibrine, and forming a barrier between the matter and the surrounding healthy tissues. It insulates the pus, and confines it to the part in which it is deposited; otherwise it would spread along the cellular tissue generally, as the fluid of anasarca does. The inflammation is most violent in the centre, and there produces suppuration; it is less violent in the circumference, causing merely interstitial effusion, and consequent condensa- tion. These different effects represent what Mr. Hunter has de- nominated adhesive and suppurative inflammations, which terms designate here, as in most other cases, merely dif- ference in degree, not in the nature of the disturbance. At a greater distance from the suppurative centre the increased action is still further lessened, and causes merely serous effusion. The pus contained in such an abscess is a thick, whitish or yellowish, homogeneous, soft fluid; it is as thick as the thickest cream, and sometimes even more so, having the con- sistence of a soft solid, like butter. Such matter has been called good or laudable pus, pus laudabile. This expres- sion, singularly but not inappropriately denotes the kind of purulent effusions produced by high inflammation in a healthy individual. Generally speaking, the higher the inflammation, the thicker the matter produced by it. Pus is heavier than water, and sinks in it. This has been

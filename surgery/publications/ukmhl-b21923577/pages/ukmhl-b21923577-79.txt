ITS EFFECTS AND VARIETIES. 59 thickening from effusion into the inflamed textures. After suppuration has taken place in one part fresh excitement may occur in the neighbourhood. Thus, inflammation origi- nating in the finger gradually extends into the palm of the hand and thence along the forearm, producing in these various parts changes of structure by which the motions of the limbs are impaired or entirely lost. Hence the great importance of preventing such a calamity by employing the most effectual measures at as early a stage as possible. The idea of inflammation drawn from the examination of external parts has been generalised, and hence it has been said to consist in the five circumstances I have detailed, namely, redness, swelling, heat, pain and impaired function; we do not include the sympathetic influences in our general notion of inflammation, because they do not invariably attend. The disturbance of the sanguiferous and digestive systems, of the secretions and excretions, which constitute inflammatory fever, are only observed when inflammation is violent, extensive, or seated in an important organ. In less serious cases these influences, though not strongly marked, are seldom wanting, while they may be very severe occasionally, where the disease is neither extensive nor seated in a part of importance, as in inflammation about the finger-nail, in thecal abscess, in suppuration under the periosteum, parti- cularly on the cranium. Not knowing the exact nature of the local changes, we are not surprised when we find that almost directly opposite opmions have been entertained respecting the state of the circulation in the inflamed spot. One thing is clear namely, that if a vein be opened between the seat Vf disease and the heart, a much greater quantity of blood will flow m the same time than if no inflammation existed * * All .icroscopical equations prove that in one spot, where the Lnflaxn-

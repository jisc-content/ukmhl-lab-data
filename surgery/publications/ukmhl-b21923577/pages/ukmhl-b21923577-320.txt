,JUU TETANUS. injuries, particularly of the extremities, more rarely of the head, neck, or trunk. I saw it, however, once in a wound of the nose of unimportant character; the integument on the convexity of the organ was divided down to the bone by a fall from the horse, when the face came in contact with the ground in a gravelled road. The patient, a gentleman about fifty, was in good health at the time, and the apparently trivial wound was granulating quite favorably. It is caused most frequently by contused, lacerated, or punctured wounds. It has been supposed to arise, more especially, from injuries of nerves, but these organs are involved in all wounds of soft parts. It has been fancied that tetanus may arise from a nerve having been included with an artery in a ligature. This is probably an imaginary notion. At all events, tetanus rarely occurs in these climates after operations, although nerves must often be included in the same ligature with arteries* Tetanus may occur in all states or stages of a wound, when it is inflamed or sloughing, going on favorably, or when the process of repair is more or less advanced. The obvious inference from these circumstances is that the com- plaint does not depend on the nature or condition of the wound, but on something not yet ascertained in the state of the patient. Sir James Macgrigor, in his " Surgical History of the English Army in the Campaigns of Spain and Por- tugal" (f Medico-Chirurgical Transactions/ vol. vi), observed that tetanus occurred in all descriptions of wounds, from the slightest to the most formidable, and in all states, from the worst to the most favorable condition, even in that of healing. It does not appear until after a few days, from five to fifteen, according to Larrey. Sir James Macgrigor * In a case of tetanus at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, following a wound of the finger, the injured memher was amputated, and on its examination a small splinter of wood was found imbedded in the digital nerve.

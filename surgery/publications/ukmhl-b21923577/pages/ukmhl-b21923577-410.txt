When seated on the prepuce, sometimes attended with induration in a slight degree. Some persons, fancying that the venereal poison must pro- duce a peculiar effect, that this must he an ulcerative exca- vation, more especially with indurated base, seem to consider that a simple abrasion of cuticle cannot be the effect of an animal poison, they say "that's an excoriation! it is not venereal." I have no doubt that the primary effect of the venereal poison may be either a mere excoriation or a sore of the most superficial kind; and that secondary symptoms may follow such primary affections.

Inflammation, with exoriation, in red and white patches, and superficial ulceration. e Inflammation, with ulcer, at the base of the prepuce. VI Phagedenic sore. All ulceration is phagedenic in its origin and progress; that is, there is destruction of parte. In the venereal sores already considered this loss is incon- siderable in extent, and proceeds slowly. In phagedenic primary sores, the destruction of parts by ulceration is more considerable : they seem eaten away, and a conspicuous loss of substance is soon produced. The margin of the sore is sharp, generally irregular; portions of it turn livid and then perish. The surface is irregular, tawny, or livid, without any attempt at repair. There is no surrounding hardness.

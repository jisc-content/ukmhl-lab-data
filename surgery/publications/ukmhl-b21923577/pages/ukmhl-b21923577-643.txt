MELANOSIS OF THE EYE. 623 turned backwards, so as to expose fully the front of the orbit, and the posterior connexions being divided as far back as could be accomplished conveniently. Examination of the eye.—The globe, not unnaturally soft, was divided through the centre. There was no trace of vitreous humour; a dark and blackish mass, of soft con- sistence, occupied nearly the whole interior of the globe, pressing the retina, which was healthy, and formed a flattened mass, towards its inner side, and the crystalline lens, which was semi-transparent, against the posterior surface of the cornea.

There was but Httle subsequent bleeding; no vessels were tied. Four hours after, she had cold chills, and vomited several times. She quitted the hospital, well, on December 6th. September 6th, 1842.—She was seen in good health; there was no return of disease in the orbit. From the time of her leaving the hospital she was in a laborious situation as domestic servant, and remained well to the latter end of 1844, when she called upon me, complaining of pain and fulness in the abdomen. Suspecting that internal disease might be forming, I advised her to leave her situation, and to come into the hospital. December 12th.—There is a small swelling on the right side of the navel, covered by healthy skin, of which the

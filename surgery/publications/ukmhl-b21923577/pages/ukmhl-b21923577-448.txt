A more formidable affection of this part is necrosis of the bony structures, with active and painful inflammation of the mem- branous coverings. Portions of bone are lost successively m the progress of the disease. If the septum and ossa nasi go flattening of the bridge is inevitable, with irremediable deformity, especially if it should be accompanied with phage- denic ulceration of the external nose.

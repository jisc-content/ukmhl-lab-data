546 EPITHELIAL CANCER. morbid growth, resume their natural position, and when the cicatrization is completed, very little appearance of loss remains. When morbid deposit has taken place under the diseased skin of the red edge, carrying the mischief lower down, the external integument becomes hardened and adhe- rent, and a different operation is necessary. A V-shaped in- cision is required for removing the entire disease, and the edges must be united after the manner of the operation on hare-lip. Occasionally a still more complicated proceed- ing is resorted to. If the original disease has involved the whole breadth of the lip, or nearly so, a vertical incision is made on each side of the disease, and these are united by a transverse cut; the diseased part is then dissected off to the edge of the mucous membrane. The gap thus produced is to be filled by a portion of soft parts brought up from below. The two vertical incisions are prolonged over the bone into the neck, and a portion of integument is then lifted and drawn up so as to be fastened to the edge of the mucous mem- brane. For the successful result of this plan it is necessary that the mucous membrane of the lip should be sound, at least in great measure, since a lip without a mucous surface answers no useful purpose, not even that of retaining the saliva. If the cancer of the lip is properly removed in an early stage, when confined or nearly so, to the red edge, without any affection of absorbent glands, the patient may remain well for years, and there is generally no return of disease in the part. Sooner or later the glands under the jaw or on the side of the neck become affected, the latter forming a very large mass, the progress of which leads inevitably to a fatal termination. I have known a patient to have one of these large formations in the neck after having remained perfectly well for nine years. They may destroy life without becoming ulcerated.

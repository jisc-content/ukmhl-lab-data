180 ULCERATION. that visible portions, of larger or smaller hulk, perish in one case; while in the other the loss of substance is in detail, the disorganized fragments being detached in so minute a form that they generally escape observation, being carried away and concealed by the discharges from the exposed surfaces. Sometimes, however, shreds of decayed tissue may he seen on the surface of an ulcer, and minute particles may be recognised in the discharge of a spreading sore, being more numerous in proportion as this is thinner and less puriform. Again, the pus flowing from a cavity in which there is dead bone is loaded with granules of phosphate of lime. This mode of dilapidation has been sometimes not inaptly characterised as molecular disintegration. The close approximation of the two processes is still further illustrated by the intermediate gradations, which conduct us so insensibly from one to the other, that we are sometimes in doubt to which of the two particular cases should be assigned. Again, the two modes of destruction not unfre- quently exist in different portions of one and the same diseased surface, as we may see in syphilitic phagedena, both primary and secondary, in hospital gangrene, and even m spreading ulcerations of less formidable character. There is no hetter exemplification of ulceration than m the separation of a slough from the living parts when mor- tification has ceased. There is first adhesive inflammation, with redness, heat, and swelling, by which the textures are thickened, and blood-vessels are closed; loss of substance follows. Ulceration, then, is loss of vitality in the component particles of a tissue, with discharges which, at first thin and perhaps tinged with blood, soon become thicker and purulent. The breach of surface thus produced is an ulcer. It is a vital, not a chemical or mechanical process; it is not erosion. The loss of substance is not originally produced, nor is the

ULCERATION. 185 ring the surface when damaged by loss of substance, cicatrices may present differences of character under different cir- cumstances. When ulceration has been confined to the surface of the skin, without going through the texture, the cicatrix which begins at once over the whole surface, is thin, pale, and smooth, as large as the sore, since there has been no loss of integument, and free from puckering in the circumference. It is, however, immediately distinguish- able from the natural skin by the absence of the fine lines and hairs of the latter, and by the want of that combined softness, elasticity, and strength, which belong to the true skin. When there has been much loss of substance, the scar will be irregular and hard, often with contraction of the sur- rounding skin. It has been stated that the rete mucosum is not repro- duced in the dark races. Cicatrices have been at least partially coloured where I have seen them in negroes. Absorption of the granulations goes on pari passu with the formation of the cicatrix, causing a regular contraction of the scar, accompanied by elongation of the surrounding skin. This process, which continues throughout the whole course of healing, and sometimes for months afterwards, causes con- traction of the sore by its circumference being drawn towards the centre. Hence a cicatrix or scar is much smaller than the ulcer was, and the sound skin is drawn from the neigh- bouring parts to make up the difference. Where the in- tegument is loose, and the ulcer or wound of moderate extent, the surrounding skin takes the place of that which was lost, the cicatrix becoming smaller and smaller, and then the peculiar material on which this contracting process depends becomes also absorbed, and the new covering acquires the aspect of a thin, pale, membranous patch. But when there has been a large destruction of skin and subjacent

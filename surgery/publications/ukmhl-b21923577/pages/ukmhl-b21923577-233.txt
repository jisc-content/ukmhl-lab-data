PROGNOSIS. 213 others are entirely free; while the beginning and progress of the affection have been altogether different in the two cases. Internal causes, of which the nature and operation are unknown, may render persons more liable to mortification. An example is afforded by the use of spurred rye for food, the pernicious effect of which is not unfrequent in the north of Europe, though almost if not entirely unknown in England. Prognosis.â€”Mortifications from external causes, of small extent in unimportant parts, such as the skin, are of no ma- terial consequence. Even if the injury were a little larger and deeper, it would probably not be dangerous under judicious treatment. In other cases, whether from external or internal causes, the affair is serious, often most dangerous, involving, more immediately or remotely, loss of limb or of life. Mor- tifications from internal causes are more dangerous than those from external. In the former the constitution is in fault, and we may expect that the mischief will spread, return after it has once been arrested, or show itself elsewhere; in the latter, the affected part is concerned only, or at least chiefly. The mere local changes are no criterion of the danger; their extent affords no measure of the risk to life. An Irishman of middle age was brought into the hospital from a workhouse in Islington. He had received a sb>ht injury in the shin and had neglected it. Pain and swelling came on, preventing him from following his occupation, that of a labourer, and he was received into the workhouse, from which it was soon deemed necessary to transfer him to St Bartholomew's. The left lower limb was in a dangerous con- dition in nearly its entire length, the foot and leg bein- swelled, and bright red, with mortification from knee to ankle

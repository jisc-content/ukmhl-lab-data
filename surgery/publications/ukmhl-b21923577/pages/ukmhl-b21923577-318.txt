^yo TETANUS. has found it advisable to persevere with the remedy. This plan of treatment has been followed by others, without doing harm in any case, but not with invariable success. To a female, about fifty, with a bad fracture of the leg, by whom two or three large doses of laudanum had been taken without effect, T gave three drachms of the tincture, which quieted her immediately and permanently, inducing a tranquil state of the circulation, under which recovery went on most favorably.

The latter is preceded for some time, probably a few days, by actual fever; in the former delirium is the first symptom, and such constitutional disturbance as may take place is secondary. The violent restlessness and incessant agitation of the former do not take place in the latter. TETANUS. A serious affection of the muscular and nervous system, under this name, is observed as a remote consequence of local injury. The word tetanus, which is of Greek extraction, means tension or contraction; and tetanus may be defined as a state of spasm or permanent contraction of some portion or the whole of the voluntary muscles; rigiditas spastica is the expression of Cullen. When we say permanent con- traction, the expression must be understood with some limi- tation. The state of the voluntary muscles in this disease is, generally, that of spasm, but there are paroxysms of con- vulsions ; there is occasional relaxation of the muscles, and such is their state in sleep. We cannot, therefore, say that the voluntary muscles are permanently contracted through the whole period that this affection lasts. The state may be

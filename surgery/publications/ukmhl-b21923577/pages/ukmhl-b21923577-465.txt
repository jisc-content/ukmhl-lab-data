SYPHILIS IN INFANTS. 445 that the constitution had become affected previously to that time. The effect of the venereal disease, when it has been intro- duced into the system of the mother, and has thus influenced the health of her offspring, does not end here. The con- taminated infant may communicate the malady by suckling to a healthy woman, in whom, although the source of in- fection has been constitutional, it appears in the primary form, that is, in ulcers of the breast, with glandular swellings in the axilla, these being followed by the usual train of secondary symptoms. The offspring of a woman thus diseased will be syphilitic, and capable of communicating the disease. This serious misfortune is not confined to a single birth, but may extend to several, whether the original affection was caused by sexual intercourse or in other manners. These points, as weU as the general history of the complaint, its effects and treatment, are sufficiently illustrated by the following cases. Mrs. Bâ€”, twenty-nine years of age, who had been married ten years and had ten children, had given birth to a healthy child four years before I saw her. When it was a month old she went as wet-nurse to a place where she stayed three months; the infant was perfectly healthy. She then went to suckle a child three weeks old, whose mother had died suddenly. This child had a sore mouth when she took to it. In a week afterwards she says that it came out in sores on the seat, that the nostrils ran with corruption, the eyes were sore, and the skm of the head peeled off. She suckled this child for ten weeks, when it died. Both her nipples began to be sore as soon as she took to this child, and a lump as large as a walnut formed in the left armpit. Her throat became ul- cerated, and was so bad that what she drank ran out of her nose. Her throat was bad for five months, and got well under salivation, and nothing has ailed her since. Within

46 INFLAMMATION, part, and in the palm, it is tense and firm, softer at the back of the hand. The redness is a bright scarlet, or light crimson tint It is that kind of colonr which we suppose to be pro- duced by an increased quantity of arterial blood in the part The redness is most intense in the immediate neighbourhood of the injury, and from that it is gradually shaded off towards the sound parts. The increased heat is sensible to the touch The patient, too, complains of burning heat in the seat ot disease. If, however, we examine the temperature by the thermometer, we do not find such an increase as the sensation described by the patient would lead us to expect. The heat does not rise beyond the natural temperature of the blood, namely, about 98° Fahrenheit. This point has been particu- larly investigated by Mr. Hunter. He excited inflammation in the cavity of the chest, in the vagina and rectum of animals j and he found that the temperature of those parts never rose, under any intensity of inflammation he could excite, beyond the natural temperature of the blood. If you place a blister on the skin of the chest, and afterwards examine the temperature of the part from which the cuticle has been removed you will find the thermometer will probably rise about two degrees beyond the temperature of the surrounding skin In the same experiment on the extremities, the differ- ence'of temperature will probably be four degrees, because the temperature of the extremities is naturally lower than that of the parts near to the centre of the circulation On one occasion, in which Mr. Hunter was operating for hydro cele by incision, he introduced the bulb of a ther— into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, and found the tm- perature to be 92° S on the following^day, when inflation had commenced, it had risen to 98^°*. * MM.Beequerel and Breschet are supposed to have found an inflamed part considerably hotter than the internal organs of the body-that K to m

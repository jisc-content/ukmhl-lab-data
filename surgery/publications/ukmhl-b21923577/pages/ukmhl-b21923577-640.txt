620 MELANOSIS OF THE EYE. apparently of the neighbouring gland, a larger swelling in the axilla, and a firm tumour in the skin of the opposite axilla. The patient had always enjoyed good health, and was quite well when I saw him. MELANOSIS OF THE EYE. The primary seat of this affection is probably in the choroid coat; it is certainly between the sclerotica and the retina, which suffer at first merely from pressure of the morbid growth. Where the melanotic substance is deposited, the choroid cannot be traced, but it is seen, of natural appearance, lining the sclerotica, in the part free from disease. Although no trace of melanotic degeneration in the optic nerve had been observed in either of the two cases subsequently related, that nerve was discoloured in the second, and the dark tumour within the cranium was probably connected with the continuation of the same cord. In a case which I examined after death many years ago, where the contents of the orbit had been converted into a mass of disease nearly black, the same structure was continued through the foramen opticum, and connected with a large deposit of similar colour at the base of the brain. By the operation of excision before the morbid deposit has pierced through the coats of the eye, life may be prolonged for an uncertain period, of which four years may be the out- side, but it is doubtful whether the success has been per- manent in any case. I operated some years ago on a young Irishman, under thirty ; he recovered quickly, and I saw him in good health more than a year afterwards : he promised to return to the hospital if anything should happen to him. I have neither seen nor heard of him since, but do not thereby conclude that he is still living. The longest period of safety,

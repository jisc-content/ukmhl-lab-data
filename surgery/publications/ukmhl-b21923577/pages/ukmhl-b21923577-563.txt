LIP. 543 thickened, hardened, and swollen, the surface being irregular and rough, or covered by a thin scab. Taken between the finger and thumb it is felt as a hardish mass. The change extends along the surface, involving the outer skin and the mucous membrane, but not going deeply. Ulceration begins sometimes by a fissure or crack, the surface having been pre- viously raised, and presenting a broken appearance. In a gentleman of fifty, who had never smoked, disease of the lower Hp had existed between five and six years, without pain or material inconvenience. It consisted of a small, indo- lent induration, causing a slight swelling of the red edge and mucous membrane, of circular outline, not larger than a shilling, with ulceration in the centre, covered by a brown incrustation. It had commenced by an indurated tubercle, and had not been long ulcerated. After removal, the diseased part presented a small mass of firm scirrhous induration, while the ulceration had a broken surface like that of some warts. A healthy farmer of seventy had a disease of the upper lip, which had begun ten years before as a wart on the skin, half an inch above the red edge. The hardened part ulcerated, and the complaint slowly spread down- wards to the mucous membrane, which was sound. It then formed an ulcer three quarters of an inch long, and half an inch wide, with a hard base, knotted and irregular margin, with sparing discharge, and covered by a hard adherent incrustation. A section of the part after excision showed the skin converted into a stratum of compact scirrhous structure. The induration extends at the base, in the course of time; thus the disease advances lower in the lip, of which the integument and other tissues become converted into a solid, hard mass. The discharge from the ulcerated portion, not abundant, forms thin and closely adherent scabs. The ab- sorbent glands under the jaw are not soon affected. The

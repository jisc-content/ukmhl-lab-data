196 SLOUGHING PHAGEDENA. blended into a pulpy mass of uncertain depth. The dis- charge is a copious brown, thickish fluid, of peculiarly offensive odour, immediately recognisable, even at some distance from the patient. Distinct sloughs are sometimes seen ; loss of blood from the surface is not unfrequent. The mischief is confined to the skin and the immediately subjacent strata; the surrounding skin is of deep red, with some inflammatory thickening of the parts beneath. The pulse is accelerated and feeble, while appetite and rest are lost from the incessant and severe pain. This formidable and distressing affection seems to be altogether local] at all events, it is completely under the power of a strictly local remedy, namely, destruction of the disorganized tissues by an effective escharotic, capable of penetrating the mass in its entire depth, such as strong nitric acid, which was introduced into practice by Mr. Welbank, a former pupil of St. Bartholomew's, whose paper " On Sloughing Phagedena," in the eleventh volume of the ' Me- dico-Chirurgical Transactions/ gives an admirable description of the disease and its treatment. The mode of proceeding is to protect the surrounding skin by smearing it with oil, or preferably with laid or spermaceti cerate, to remove all discharge and blood, so as to render the surface quite dry, then to soak the disorganized mass thoroughly with strong nitric acid, thus converting it into a brownish eschar, which may be covered with cotton-wool, dry lint or poultice. The surrounding surfaces should be kept as free from moisture as possible. The application of the acid should be made under the influence of chloroform. The severe pain, which may last from one to two hours, may render an opiate necessary. As soon as the pam of the appli- cation has ceased, the local and general suffering of the disease will have ended, and the patient may be said to be well. She will probably rest well, and be quite recovered the following

HYDKOPHOBIA. *b3 I do not know whether they could he sustained hy sufficient proof. In fifteen patients seen hy one observer, the limits were fourteen days, and fourteen weeks. Of seventeen persons bitten by a wolf, ten had hydrophobia; one on the fifteenth, one so late as the sixty-eighth day. (S. Cooper < Diet/ p. 700.) Fifteen persons were bitten by a mad dog on the 27th of January, ten received the bites on the naked flesh; of these five died between February 27th and April 3rd. (S. Cooper, p. 698.) The appearance of the symptoms has sometimes been pre- ceded by changes in the part; by beat, redness, and pain, the latter shooting along the limb. Generally there are no such symptoms, and the patients have sometimes even forgotten the injury. In a first short stage of the complaint there is usually headache, and some general indisposition, speedily followed by the peculiarly characteristic symptoms. These may be stated to consist generally of the strongest aversion to or horror of liquids, especially of water, and of the severest spasmodic agony excited by the attempt to swallow it. The complaint sometimes begins altogetber suddenly with this strange suffering. If the patient is induced, not without difficulty, to repeat the effort, violent spasm of the throat and neck, with sense of choking and ungovernable agitation are produced, altogether defeating the object, and impelling the patient to escape from the bed or room; this spasm being sometimes so powerful and general as absolutely to prevent the desired movements. The same distress, in less degree, is caused by the mere presence of water in sight, and particularly by the sound of pouring it from one vessel into another: vet a youth under my care in St. Bartholomew's, during a hard frost in the winter, ate greedily thin ice, chewing it like a biscuit to relieve his thirst. Spasms will be brought on also

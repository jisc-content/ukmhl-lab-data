410 SYPHILIS. to a healthy surface, on which, without any change appreciable by our senses having occurred in the intermediate time, a sore comes after several days, or possibly some weeks. Some impression must have been made on the part at the time, and why may not that impression, whatever it may be, lead to a syphilitic bubo, as well as to a primary syphilitic ulcer? It is a question of experience to be settled by facts, not by bare assertion, however positive. Common principles of treatment are applicable to syphilitic inflammation of the absorbent glands, viz., local bleeding, which is not often required, cold lotions, poultices, light diet, and rest in the recumbent position; the latter is of importance by allaying the local inflammation, and thus preventing the occurrence of suppuration or lessening its amount. If suppuration has already occurred, the matter will some- times, but not frequently, be removed by absorption, the swelling disappearing without any external discharge. If the suppuration, when of moderate extent, is coming favorably to the surface, it may be allowed to discharge naturally. Should the quantity of matter be more considerable, with the skin reddened and raised, it must be discharged by a surgical openin-. This should be made, not in the long axis of the swelling, but in the vertical direction, through the whole breadth, from above downwards, in order to give the most favorable drainage for the matter, and to prevent its detention by the thinned skin. If the integument has been much thinned and detached, it may be rubbed with the potassa fusa on its most prominent part to the extent of half or three quarters of an inch, the eschar being cut through on the following day; it is advantageous to destroy some of the thinned skin in this way. If the granulating process should still be languid and tardy, the red precipitate ointment, the nitrate of silver, or sulphate of copper, with compression and

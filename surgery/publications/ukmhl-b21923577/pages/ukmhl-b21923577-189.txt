CHRONIC ABSCESS. 169 to tlie parts. If air is admitted into the cavity, the pus lodging there is decomposed and rendered irritating, and thus perhaps excites inflammation in the cyst. The inflamed cyst, often very extensive, acts sympathetically on the stomach, alimentary canal, circulation, and secretions, pro- ducing fever. This constitutional disturbance reacts on the local mischief. The local malady, with its excessive discharge, and the general reaction, reduce the powers, generally feeble in these cases, and the patient dies hectic. It may be questioned, whether the local mischief and the general disturbance are produced in these cases by the putre- factive decomposition of the matter consequent on the intro- duction of air into the abscess; or, whether inflammation of the cyst is the first event, and the changes in the matter are secondary. The occurrences now specified are seen when we have no reason to suppose that air has been admitted, and where the matter cannot be said to be putrid. The matter may become altered and fetid, the abscess being entire, if inflammation is produced in the cyst, as iu the case last re- lated. When putrid matter is confined, it causes great con- stitutional disturbance, and complete relief ensues from its discharge. Causes.â€”Chronic abscesses sometimes owe their origin to obvious local exciting causes, such as caries of bone, or disease of a joint. Psoas or lumbar abscess and suppurations around the hip are examples. These are usually chronic affections, occurring in unhealthy constitutions. The nature of the suppuration corresponds with that of the original affection, and with the constitutional unhealthiness. When the affec- tion of bone or joint is more acute, as from external injury in a healthy subject, the surrounding inflammation is more active, and the suppuration has the same character. Chronic abscesses more commonly come under the head of

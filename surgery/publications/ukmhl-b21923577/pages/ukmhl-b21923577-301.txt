Opium was resorted to, with generous diet, and gradual but complete recovery of health and strength, which lasted to the time of his death at a somewhat advanced age. But when the nervous symptoms, or those of irritation predominate, general depletion or other lowering measures would be injurious. Local bleeding by leeches may be necessary, and opium to quiet irritation. The strength to be supported by mild nourishment, with suitable cordials. A complete contrast to the foregoing picture was presented in the state of a young physician who had pricked the fore- finger in sewing up a body. Some pain was felt during the day; it increased on going to bed, and became so severe as to deprive him entirely of sleep.

CUTANEOUS TUBERCLES. 507 shining. At first unattended with pain, they may become a source of considerable suffering. It is important not to overlook their existence and extent, especially in reference to the question of operation. The most remarkable case I have seen in respect to the number and extension of these growths was that of an American lady, fifty years of age, in whom a growth as large as a hen's egg, which had never caused pain, had been removed, two years previously, from the left breast, by an eminent surgeon in New York, who said it was a cancer. The left breast, of which the diseased part only had been removed, not including the nipple, nor apparently any of the integument, was a uniform, scirrhous mass adhering to the chest, with a transverse cicatrix under the nipple adhering to the gland. The axillary glands formed a knotted, scirrhous swelling, not very large. Numerous hard tubercles, from the size of a pea to that of a horse-bean, were scattered irregu- larly over the chest, being most numerous on and around the breast; they reached to the opposite side, but there were none in the abdomen j there were some at the back of the chest, and two or three about the neck; they involved the skin, which was slightly reddened over several, but not all of them, and were not painful, neither was the breast. The eyelids, without being swelled, could only be opened imperfectly, so as to present a small slit. The cause was found, on close ex- amination, to be the growth of a substance from the surface of the orbit, firm, incompressible, and closely adhering to the bone. This occupied both the upper and lower portions of the right, but the upper only of the left orbit. It was probably a cancerous growth, and allowed of the upper lids being raised only to a trifling extent. The lady had a cough of" recent occurrence, to which she had not been subject previously. She had an unhealthy, sallow countenanance, and was very thin.

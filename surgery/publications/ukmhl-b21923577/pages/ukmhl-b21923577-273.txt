QUESTION OF AMPUTATION. 253 In early amputation there is merely the risk of the opera- tion j if delayed, the patient incurs successively the dangers of the wound and those of the operation. Thus delay exposes the patient to the chance of dying before the period for second- ary amputation arrives. It is alleged that persons in full health do not bear opera- tion's so well as those previously reduced by disease; and this may be true to a certain extent. But the question is, will the patient, whether he be in full health or otherwise, have a better chance for life with a terribly contused and lacerated wound, attended with splintered bone, exposed joint, or other complications, than with the clean cut of an amputa- tion? When the necessity of operation is admitted, will the patient bear it better, and have a better chance of recovery after the inflammation, the fever, the suppu- ration consequent on the injury, than at the moment of the accident ? They will not, nor so well. Hear the result of experience. After the battle of Toulouse, 47 primary amputations were performed; 9 of the patients died, that is, one fifth, nearly; there were 51 cases of delayed amputation, of which 21 were lost, or about one to two and a half. At New Orleans, of 45 primary amputations 7 died, being one in six and three sevenths; of 7 delayed, 2 died, or one in three and a half. These statements are very favorable to early or immediate amputation, but they do not give the true comparison of mortality between the two methods, they do not place the advantages of the former in their full light; because to those who died of secondary amputation you should add the others who died before the time for secondary amputation arrived, and who might have been saved by the early opera- tion. The result of my own comparatively limited experience of

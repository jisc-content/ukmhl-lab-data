JOINTS—NOSE. 427 print, that the diseases of the osseous system now under consideration arise, not from syphilis, but from the use of mercury. These affections appear to me to result as un- equivocally from the syphilitic poison as sore throat, erup- tions, iritis, or any other among the universally recognised symptoms of the disease. They are to be met with frequently where no mercury has been taken previously, and they are seen as frequently yielding, with other concomitant symptoms, to an employment of the remedy which has had no preju- dicial influence on the constitution. I have never seen them arise from the most free use of mercury, when employed in other cases, while, on the other hand, it may be used with advantage in periosteal affections not connected with syphilis. Joints.—These may be placed in the following order, so far as relates to the frequency of affection, namely, knee, ankle, foot, hand, elbow, hip, shoulder. In the knee there may be inflammation of the synovial membrane, with effusion or general swelling, without recognisable effusion. In the foot and hand there is swelling, apparently affecting the perios- teum of the metatarsal and metacarpal bones. These affec- tions of joints are most frequent as secondary affections of phagedenic syphilis. They are likely to occur with severity in constitutions injured by the long prevalence of disease and repeated use of mercury. Like the bones, the joints may be the seat of pain, without the presence of actual disease. Nose.—Its mucous lining may be affected with ulceration of active and painful, but more frequently of chronic cha- racter. The discharge of such ulcers dries into scabs, which may obstruct the passage of air in breathing, and are some- times not forced out without pain and difficulty; they may be streaked with blood, and are apt to be offensive The ulceration often attacks the septum of the nostrils, which it

PRIMARY SORES. 401 disease. When the phagedenic sore is proceeding actively, destroying the affected parts by an ulcerative, not sloughing, process, without surrounding inflammation, or material con- stitutional disturbance, the active use of mercury, both locally and internally, is indicated. At an early period of my practice, when doubts and difficulties had been raised and uncertainty prevailed respecting mercury, I saw a seafaring man from Wapping with a large quickly spreading ulcer of the glans, eating deep, with foul phagedenic surface. It spread for three or four days under my fruitless efforts to do good by soothing treatment. At this time the patient was fortunately seen in consultation with me by the late Mr. Thomas Blizard, an adherent to the ancient faith of mercury, which he immediately pronounced to be the only remedy for saving the remainder of the glans; it was imme- diately resorted to internally, and by friction, with black wash to the part. The mouth was quickly and profusely affected, and rapid cicatrization ensued. If there should be much pain, and if the constitution is depressed, opiates and sarsaparilla would be advantageous. The lining of the prepuce is sometimes penetrated by phagedena at the fold where it is reflected over the glans, and the ulceration then burrows between the penis and the sheath of integument reaching possibly to the pubes, and nearly msulating the body of the organ. This mischief can only be remedied by incision, so as to expose the morbid surface completely. As the phagedenic and sloughing sores are allied forms of disease, the one passing by insensible gradations into the other we may be at a loss to determine whether to administer mer' cury or to adopt a mild and soothing local treatment. When the sore presents a blackish, or dark-brown slough, it is a case for soothing local measures, perhaps with some direct antiphlo- 26

HYDKOPHOBIA. 259 Sportsmen, who have many dogs, keep hydrophobia out of their kennels by making every new comer perform quaran- tine before he is admitted. In insular situations, many years have often passed without any appearance of the disease. Dr. I. Hunter states that no case of hydrophobia had occurred in Jamaica for forty years, although the dogs are as numerous there as in any place in the world. (* Trans, of a Society/ vol. i.) This leads me to mention that heat of climate or season does not seem to have the commonly supposed efficacy in producing hydrophobia. It is rare in the West Indies, not known in Egypt and some other hot countries; it occurs here in winter as well as in summer. On the other hand, Dr. Hertwig states that he has fre- quently seen rabies arise spontaneously in the dog, the causes of origin being very obscure. It appears, he says, in dogs of every race, and all ages; under every species of management; at all times of the year, and in every kind of weather. Heat and cold have no influence in its origin. Chamber dogs are more liable to it than those exposed to the weather. We cannot, I think, help admitting with Dr. Hertwig that hydrophobia must originate spontaneously in the dog. The history of the disease cannot be accounted for except on that supposition. There are not here, as in smallpox and cowpox, constantly existing sources of infection, by which the poison can be directly conveyed from one animal to another. The disease, though so much talked about, is of rare occur- rence. Many surgeons of the most extensive practice have never seen a case, and it is of the greatest rarity in the lai-e hosptals of London. Considerable periods of time elapse without a case being heard of in England, and if an in stance or two should turn up after a long interval, the animals are soon put out of existence. These circumstances are quite inconsistent with the notion that the disorder can originate

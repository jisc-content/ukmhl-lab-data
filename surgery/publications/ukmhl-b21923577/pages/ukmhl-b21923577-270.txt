GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 250 synovial membranes, and tendons, bruised and torn, imme- diate amputation is best. Many cases of recovery under sucli circumstances have been recorded, and some occurred among the ' blesses de Juillet/ under Dupuytren. But how many fatal terminations could be opposed to these unexpected cures." M. Velpeau then mentions the fatal issue of wounds by gunshot of the hand, ankle, elbow, and knee, where the injury was not of the worst kind, although treated under every advantage in Paris. He goes on to say that gunshot injuries in the continuity of the limb, especially in the lower extremities, are almost as unfavorable as wounds of the joints; thus, that a splintered fracture by gunshot of the tibia and fibula almost always requires amputation. For one who recovers, you will have ten die, especially if the soft parts are torn and bruised. The indication is still more decisive in the thigh. He quotes the opinion of Ravaton, Schmucker, and Lombard. M. Ribes gives an account of ten cases, which all ended fatally, in spite of the greatest care. Among 4000 men at the Invalids there was not one who had been cured of such an injury.- M. Yvan had two, in 1815; but fistulous openings remained, and they died from the results of the injury. M. Gaulthier de- Claubry formerly surgeon to the Imperial Guard, is of the same opinion as M. Kibes, and all in Spain who had met with this injury died when amputation was not immediately performed. He quotes the experience of S.Cooper, Percy, Thomson, Larrey, and Heunen. The events of July, 1830, showed the surgeons of Paris the correctness of this unfavorable prognostic. However, some successful cases occurred; one at La Pitie, under M. Lisfranc, one under Dupuytren. Arnal mentions three more. Somme saved two out of eight at Antwerp, and some other trials were equally fortunate both at Paris and Brussels. In these

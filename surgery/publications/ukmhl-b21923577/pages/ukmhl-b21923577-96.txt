76 TEEATMENT OE INFLAMMATION. Hence it is necessary to arrest inflammation in order to prevent sncli changes, although the organ may not be im- portant to life; and we must employ active means in the former as in the latter case, if this purpose is to he satis- factorily accomplished. Thirdly, even supposing the organ not to he important to life and, further, that we have no reason to apprehend any of the more serious effects, it is still very desirable to arrest inflammation quickly. The longer the vessels remain dis- tended, the more slowly do they recover their natural state; and the more easily do they again become disordered. Hence the continuance of inflammation increases the difficulty of recovery and the liability to relapse. Hence an organ, which has been once seriously diseased, is likely to suffer again. The persons who undertake life assurances are well aware of this However well a person may be at the time when he offers himself, they either do not nndertake the risk, or they impose such terms as may secure them against future loss if they find that he has had serious disease, and they in- quire carefully into his sanitary history. Fourthly, we are to consider the relief from present suffering in acute inflammation attended with sympathetic fever. There are certain preliminary and auxiliary measures of general application which, without directly tending to check inflammation, place the patient under the most favorable circumstances for the direct means. They consist m removing all causes capable of increasing local or general excitement. The exciting cause should be got rid of when practicable; you would remove a foreign body from the eye, and guard against cold and damp, when exposure to these agents has brought on disease. You must enforce, as far as possible repose of the affected organ. If it be a joint, the patient must not use the limb. Inflamed eyes must be kept at rest,

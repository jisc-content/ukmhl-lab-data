230 • CANCRUM ORTS. perfectly well. If the disease had not been attended to early in this case, it might probably have assumed the herpetic form. Under the names of cancrum oris, nomas or nome from the Greek v£juw, depasco, and water canker, a foul phaganteric ulceration, with foetid discharge, is described, attacking the mucous membrane of the lip or cheek in children, spreading through the intermediate textures, and causing a black slough of the skin. The latter is first swelled and hard, then becomes red, and soon turns black. It attacks children of the lower class, especially those of weak constitution,in whom the powers of the system have been lowered by bad food and clothing, but it is not entirely confined to such subjects. If the disease of the mucous membrane does not exceed the size of a sixpence, the slough of the skin being about equal to a half- crown, the progress of the mischief may be stopped by an effectual application of the strong nitric acid both internally and externally, under the influence of chloroform, by bark and wine, with strong beef-tea, and perhaps an opiate at night. When the mischief is more extensive, there is little chance of saving the patient. If the affection, though more extensive, has not penetrated beyond the mucous membrane, ulceration of similar character in the gums round the necks of the teeth being combined with it, a strong solution of lunar caustic to all the morbid surface may suffice m lieu of the acid. Chlorate of potash may be combined with the bark, or substituted for it, and the same diet is required as in the preceding case.

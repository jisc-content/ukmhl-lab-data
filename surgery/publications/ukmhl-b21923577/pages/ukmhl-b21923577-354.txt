We find that a person who has for the first time a gouty attack, is almost invariably in a plethoric state, pro- duced by excessive nutrition, the result of luxurious habits and indolence. Gouty inflammation is most frequent in individuals of sanguine temperament, and in those of robust frame. Generally speaking, it is most common in the higher classes, in those whose situation in life gives them habits and the means of indulgence and indolence. In the first attack of gout the patient generally has a full, strong pulse, heat of skin, white tongue, and disorder of the digestive organs. The disorder last mentioned is not to be regarded simply as the cause of the mischief. Like the gouty attack itself, it is an effect of those habits which lead to a plethoric state of constitution. The alimentary apparatus has probably been strong and efficient, capable of assimilating the abundant nourishment introduced into the system. If the stomach be feeble and easily disordered, the state of plethora cannot be established. The originally vigorous organs being no longer equal to the tasks imposed on them, fail in their office, causing imperfection and disorder in im- portant functions, which precede the outbreak of the gouty attack. The latter gives general relief, effectually and quickly, in the early stages of the complaint. Such is the condition of a patient when he first becomes the subject of gouty attacks; but when these have been repeated, when a person has suffered for a series of years from successive attacks of gout, his state is quite different from that now described; there is deficiency in the various excretions, and a degree of languor in the system, iu which there is hardly power to form gouty paroxysms. There is little difficulty in pointing out the proper mode of

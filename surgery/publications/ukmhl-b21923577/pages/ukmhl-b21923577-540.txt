520 CANCERâ€”VARIETIES, the age of thirty. There was very considerable thickening of the plenra and of the upper part of the peritoneum. It would seem as if this long-continued disease in the neighbourhood of these serous membranes had gradually extended to them by continuity, and produced considerable alteration of their structure, a sort of cancerous change, with granular and in- durated surface. There was also in her case a cartilaginous thickening of the pericranium, covering a part of the skull, and a corresponding change of texture in the dura mater. When the disease occurs in advanced age, it not only goes on slowly, but is attended with little suffering. It lingers on for years, and in many cases does not shorten life. I saw an old lady occasionally for some years with disease in the right breast. The mammary gland was hard and atrophied. The skin over the nipple was drawn in, making one deep, trans- verse furrow, and there were two or three others less con- siderable joining this. In the hollow of this furrow there appeared a reddish prominence, as if ulcerated, but it was dry. At the age of eighty-two, when the disease had lasted four years, this lady's health was excellent; she was strong and active, with fresh and healthy complexion. In a female of seventy-six, lusty, with every appearance of good health, which she had always enjoyed, and not looking more than sixty, married, but not having borne children, there was a scirrhous induration of the mammary gland on the axillary side of the nipple. There was firm adhesion of the integument, drawn into a long and deep fold. The nipple was greatly retracted, being at the bottom of a narrow cuta- neous funnel an inch in depth. The indurated mass was not adherent behind. The affection, which had existed for two years, had not impaired health, and had caused but little pain. There were occasional sensations of short duration, described as shooting or darting.

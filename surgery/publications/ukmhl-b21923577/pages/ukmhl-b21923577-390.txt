370 SYPHILIS. set of instances and the deposition in the others are merely the local restorative effects consequent on the cessation of the inflammation which had produced them. The most unequivocal example of antisyphilitic influence is afforded in the action of mercury on ulcers of the throat and mouth. This remedy produces inflammation and ulceration, even sloughing of these membranes, yet it arrests syphilitic ulceration and leads to its repair. I have seen venereal ulcers of the lips and tongue healing rapidly while the mer- cury was causing ulceration, with ash-coloured slough, of the immediately adjoining membrane. Thus mercury showed itself at once both bane and antidote. Mercury has been said to cure syphilis by its specific power, and the specific action of mercury is said to be that of curing syphilis. This raises the question, what is a specific? The common and rather loose notion considers it as a remedy having a peculiar and direct action on a certain disease. The beneficial influence of remedies is often clearly explained by some general action on the system, as that of purgatives and dia- phoretic medicines in fever. Mercury does not cure syphilis by its action on the bowels, the mouth, liver, kidneys, or skin, nor by excitement of the vascular system, for none of those are essential to its beneficial influence on the disease, which appears to our ignorance as a direct agency, like that of sulphur on the itch and of bark on ague. It is m this sense that mercury may be called a specific for syphilis. Mr. Hunter says that it produces an irritation in the sys- tem which counteracts the irritation of the poison. This pretended explanation does not seem to me to carry our knowledge a single step beyond the general and popular statement that " mercury cures a pox."

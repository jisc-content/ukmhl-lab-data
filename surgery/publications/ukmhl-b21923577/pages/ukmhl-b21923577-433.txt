SECONDARY SYMPTOMS. 413 us that in respect of the time which may elapse between primary and secondary syphilis, and between the successive manifestations of the latter, there is great latitude. I feel unable to point out a limit, that is to say, what is the greatest extent of possible interval; or what length of time may be considered as affording perfect security against the recurrence of disease. Some surgeons would, I believe, question the nature of the disease in many of these cases. They would deny that an affection could be syphilitic when the patient had been free from all symptoms for many months or several years. I think there are no good grounds for such denials. If several months may elapse between pri- mary and secondary symptoms, or between successive attacks of the latter, we can have no difficulty in admitting that the time may be extended to one or two years; and we really see cases where the point is clear. If one or two years, why not four or five, or more ? It is a mere question of expe- rience. Observe, however, that the statement now made applies to cases which are altogether exceptional. In the ordinary course, if a patient remains well for twelve months after the healing of a primary sore, the chances of secondary mischief are so small that they may be put out of considera- tion in practice. The chances are rather less favorable to the patient when secondary symptoms have already occurred. The appearance of constitutional symptoms is frequently preceded and accompanied by feverish disturbance more or less considerable, by heat, thirst, loss of appetite, headache. There may be pain in the limbs and chest, cough, acce- lerated pulse, shivering. The fever is analogous to that which precedes the eruption in the exanthemata. Syphilitic affections of the skin.â€”I.

The following ammoniacal application spread on lint is said to be mild and safe for children. Pommade Ammoniacale: Lard, 4 parts • Mutton suet, 1; Liq. Ammon., 5. The lard and suet melted together, but not hot; then add the Liq. Ammon. Friction on the neighbouring skin of the emetic-tartar ointment. One part of the Tartrate to three of lard, rubbed once or twice in the twenty-four hours, produces pimples, pustules, and superficial sloughs. A succession of these may be produced by rubbing in fresh places. Croton oil alone or with olive oil acts in a similar way. Seton issue, or moxa, are occasionally used in severe cases. The peas or other substances used to keep issues open are often productive of great pain. This is avoided in moxas.

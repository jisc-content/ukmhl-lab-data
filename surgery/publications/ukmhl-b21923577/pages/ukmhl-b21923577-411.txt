ft PRIMARY SORES. 391 Â«. Rapid destruction, with a corroded livid surface, red edge, and severe pain. b. Slower progress, creeping on for some weeks, and de- stroying the glans or prepuce without much pain. VII. Sloughing sore. We see two kinds of this affection on the genitals. The sloughing sore and the phagedsenic form of the disease are nearly allied in nature, differing chiefly in the degree of mischief, and in the course of the affection.

Within my own experience, they have occurred to persons in whom there was neither ob- servable imperfection of constitution nor impaired state of health, the disease having been received from persons in whom there could have been no malady of great virulence, or any material deviation from the state of health, inasmuch as the peculiar characters and circumstances of the disease, especially the painful state of the sexual organs, and the con- comitant constitutional disturbance, could not fail to preclude the possibility of sexual intercourse.

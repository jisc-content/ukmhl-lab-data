438 SECONDARY SYPHILIS-NOSE. More or less severe pain in the joints and limbs is often experienced in the ontset of constitutional syphilis, accom- panied with general febrile disturbance, aud it goes off m proportion as that subsides. The more serious affections of the former are generally seen in an advanced period of the complaint, and especially in phagedenic cases. There may be inflammation of the synovial membranes, with effusion into the joint, or general and painful inflammatory erUarge- xnent, without any evidence of increased secretion. If the local suffering is not relieved by the iodide of potassium and opium a few leeches may be advisable, although the patient is probably in a weakened state. Blistering may also be advan- tageous. . , The nose is sometimes, but rarely, affected m the early period of secondary symptoms. I have seen it yield at that time like other concomitant affections, to the use of mercury. Should this fail, iodide of potassium and sarsaparilla must be substituted, which are the best remedies for the complaint m its tertiary form. The accumulation of dry crusts in the nos- trils is a source not only of inconvenience but pain; it may be obviated in some degree by the steady use of tepid ^ater, either snuffed up from the palm of the hand or more forcibly introduced by syringing. The fetid discharge will so long as irritation is kept up by the presence of dead bone, which should be removed surgically as soon as it becomes loosened. This unpleasant symptom may be lessened for a time by injecting a solution of chlorate of soda, as strong as the lining membrane will bear. The regular empbyment of tepid water to clear away the crust and discharge, followed by syringing with the yellow wash or with a solution of bichlo- ride o&f mercury, in the strength of half a grain to two grains to the ounce of water, taking care that none of it shall swallowed, will be useful in all respects.

256 ECCHYMOSIS. enlarged in the course of three hours, by internal bleeding, to an enormous size, and was still increasing, with deep livid dis- coloration and most severe pain. As the swelling passed upwards on the abdomen, the incision necessary for com- plete exposure was nearly afoot long, exposing such a degree and extent of bloody cellular infiltration as could hardly be paralleled under any other circumstances. Although the swelling had been constantly increasing till the incision was made, no bleeding vessel could be discovered. The integu- ments, relieved from distension, contracted so as to diminish the exposed surface, which was still considerable. The granu- lating process went on well, and the patient, though much weakened by the very large loss of blood, soon regained his strength. When effused blood forms a collection instead of being in- filtrated, it may retain its fluidity, and form a soft, fluctuating swelling in the part, which may be mistaken for an abscess. Theprevious injury, and the absence of the symptoms denoting suppuration, ought to prevent the possibility of such a mistake. Although the fluid blood sometimes remains for a rather long time in the part, it will be ultimately absorbed. If the blood of an ecchymosis coagulates, instead of remaining fluid, it sometimes irritates the surrounding textures, and may even cause inflammation and suppuration. A free opening is neces- sary, giving issue to the coagula and matter, with great relief. I have made an incision into a labium when immensely dis- tended, coal black, and very painful, turning out some ounces of black coagula, completely easing the patient although sup- puration had not occurred.

276 DISSECTION WOUNDS. patient who had died of peritonitis, the hands having been covered for a considerable time with the abdominal effusion. The local symptoms show themselves at different intervals from the injury in different cases, within twenty-four hours in those of the most dangerous kind. In considering the causes of these occasionally serious mischiefs, the suspicion of poison naturally presents itself to the mind. In the great majority of dissection wounds, the trifling injury is hardly noticed, and soon dries up. If it goes further, the local symptoms and general disturbance are merely such as similar injuries, inflicted in other ways, would produce. How different is the course in the exceptional in- stances, such as that recorded by Mr. Travers of a student, who slightly punctured his finger in opening the body of an hospital patient recently dead at noon on Monday. Pain came on in the evening, and increased in the night with high constitutional irritation. The next day, with slight redness of the puncture, " the nervous system became agi- tated in a most violent and alarming degree, the symptoms nearly resembling the universal excitation of hydrophobia." Death occurred at three o'clock on Wednesday morning, that is in less than forty hours. (< On Constitutional Irritation/ vol. i, p. 203.) Iu some other happily rare cases, severe constitutional irritation, without much local disturbance has ended fatally in a few days. The following is a striking instance: A lady, who had died of puerperal peritonitis, was examined in the presence of a physician at eight o'clock in the morning, of December 28th. He assisted in sewing up the body, and was not aware that he had injured himself. At eight in the evening, being at a dinner party, he felt some heat and uneasiness at the end of a finger, and thought he might have pricked it in sewing the body, though not aware of having

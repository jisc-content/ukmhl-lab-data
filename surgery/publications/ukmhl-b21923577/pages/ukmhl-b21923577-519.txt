GONOEEHCEAL RHEUMATISM. 499 the influence of that unsound state of constitution which leads to these affections of the joints. That the essential cause of this combination of morbid phenomena is peculi- arity of constitution, may be inferred from the repetition of attacks, and from the length of time for which some indi- viduals are harassed by successive appearances of disease in various parts. In one case severe purulent ophthalmia oc- curred in August, 1822, and a similar one foUowed soon after, and in the following eight years six attacks of rheu- matic iritis were experienced. In another case discharge from the urethra, without infection, occurred four times, then inflammation of the foot; three years after, severe inflammation of the chambers of the aqueous humour; then gonorrhoea and mild purulent conjunctivitis, followed by rheumatic inflammation of several joints; and afterwards severe inflammation of the sclerotica and iris. In another instance violent gonorrhoea was followed by acute inflam- mation of the external tunics; a second gonorrhoea excited, first, purulent ophthalmia, then acute inflammation of the external tunics, and subsequently rheumatic inflammation of several joints: two years after, severe rheumatism was brought on by cold. I saw a gentleman with gonorrhoea, mild purulent inflammation of the eye, and rheumatic affec- tion of the foot and back; it was the fourth attack he had experienced of the same combination of symptoms. The long course of severe suffering, which has so often originated in gonorrhoea, makes it advisable to avoid all attempts to stop the progress of the complaint in persons of rheumatic constitution. A gentleman who consulted me for a clap recently contracted, informed me that he had been m the same predicament three or four years previously, when the discharge soon stopped under the use of medicine which I bad prescribed, and that he then suffered severely from an

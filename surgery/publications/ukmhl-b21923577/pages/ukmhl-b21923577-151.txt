SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS. 131 duced unless prevented by regular care. The attentions now recommended promote health and strength by maintaining an active condition of the cutaneous capillaries, and, by equalising this circulation over the entire surface, have the beneficial effect of preventing and removing local determina- tions and congestions. In the advanced stage of unhealthiness, as seen in those dl-nourished and ill-clothed persons, who pursue laborious occupations by day, and sleep at night in crowded and un- ventdated apartments, we observe how seriously the powers of the system may be impaired by a combination of de- pressing influences often aggravated by domestic cares and anxiety. Under such circumstances local disease is easdy excited and difficultly cured. The first object is to rouse and support the circulation; unless this can be accomplished, we cannot expect to see the energy of the nervous system restored, or the functions of digestion, assimilation, and nutrition brought back to their healthy state. An hospital is the best refuge for such cases; here they find warmth, cleanliness and comfort, generous diet with suitable stimuli, strengthening medicines, with the aid of the warm bath and soothing local remedies. The food with stimuli should be as nutritious and sustaining as the state of the stomach and circulation will admit. Bark and steel are the best remedies. Female domestic servants, particularly in the middle and lower classes, although previously strong and weU, often suffer much from hard work, bad hours, and imperfect rest, un- wholesome food, and exposure to cold and damp. They suffer from a disease of the legs, called erythema nodosum almost peculiar to themselves. They soon recover by rest' warmth, and good diet, with or without strengthening medicine.

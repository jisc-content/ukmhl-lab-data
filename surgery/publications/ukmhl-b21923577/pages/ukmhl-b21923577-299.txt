DISSECTION WOUNDS. 279 through dissection wounds the peculiar disease which may- have affected the individual during life, except in the cases of small-pox and glanders. The venereal disease has, I believe, never been thus communicated, nor has any peculiar effect resulted from wounds received in examining cases of cancer or other malignant diseases. Some of the effects which seem peculiar may be equally produced under other circumstances; for instance, the mor- tification of the skin round the puncture in the case of the physician, and the subsequent loss of vitality in the last two phalanges of the finger. Both these changes may have been caused by the free cauterization resorted to in the case. I saw an exactly similar limited mortification around a puncture of the finger, caused by the end of a needle pushed forcibly in sewing without the protection of a thimble. I saw it about thirty hours after the accident. The patient had passed a sleepless night, with severe disturbance of the stomach. Free division of the parts on the palmar surface of the last phalanx, which were tense, gave complete ease. I have witnessed three or four instances in which the last two phalanges of a finger have mortified under the inflam- mation induced by the neglect of trivial injuries, which the sufferers almost invariably attribute to poisoning of the parts. Treatment.â€”Prudence would suggest, under all circum- stances, simple measures of precaution, such as effective ablution, and covering the part with an adhesive plaster, particularly if the occupation of dissection should be con- tinued. The solution of alum, said to be kept at hand in some establishments, is certainly not preferable to clear water, if so good. Nitrate of silver should not be resorted to except for a special reason, and the application should then be confined to a denuded surface. If inflammat: cion

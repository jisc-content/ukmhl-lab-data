It might be considered as an appearance of the eruption under a modification dependent on the difference of structure in the surface. We sometimes see a thickening of the mucous membrane, which as sbghtly raised in a nearly circular form on the middle and back part of the dorsum, with slight fissures, giving it something of a warty character; it is attended with some pain. There may be reddish swelling of the edges of the tongue, of fissured and warty appearance, and very painful; or spongy swelling of the edges, with superficial ulceration, similar to that caused by mercury. Superficial or excavated ulcers occur on the edges or tip, less frequently on the dorsum; there may be a single ulcer, with indurated base.

DIVISIONS OF DISEASE 37 nent elements, and to determine the nature of these constituent parts. He has shown the proportions in which trfey enter into the various organs of the body, and has subjected them to every kind of analysis, anatomical and chemical. In short, he has produced a work which is truly extraordinary, when considered as the production of a man who died at so early an age. If we knew enough of the elementary structures of which the body is composed, we might estimate the disturb- ance of each system, and have a natural arrangement of its diseases. In considering diseases on this plan, we should find that much time would be saved; after explaining generally the nature of the affections to which each tissue is liable, we should only have to point out the local circumstances belonging to the diseases of each part. Suppose we take the cellular system ; inflammation of this is called phlegmon; proceeding to sup- puration, it constitutes abscess. When the phenomena of phlegmon have been once described generally, we need not repeat the account in considering each part. The same remark holds good of serous, mucous, and fibrous membranes, and indeed of all other tissues. It is, however, convenient in some cases, especially of peculiar and complicated organs, such as the eye, to describe together the affections of the part; it is not only a great aid, but almost essential to diagnosis, and makes the entire subject more intelligible. The arrangement which I propose to adopt is founded on these two considerations; for the most part regarding diseases as they occur in the various organic systems, but in other instances viewing together those seated in particular organs. Although diseases are spoken of under single names, and therefore appear to the mind at first view as single objects we find in general that each embraces a variety of circum- stances ; and that in order to understand them thoroughly they must be viewed in different lights. In the first place

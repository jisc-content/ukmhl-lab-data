HAEMORRHAGE. 241 bleed freely should be secured by ligature. Exposure to air and cold sponging soon stop the smaller arteries. Secondary haemorrhage sometimes occurs in a longer or shorter time after a wound has been closed. Faintness from loss of blood, and exposure to the air have arrested it at the time. The circulation recovers when the patient has been some time in bed, and then bleeding may come on, more par- ticularly if the part be covered with dressings and heated by the quantity of bed-clothes. The blood oozing slowly, partly coagulates in the wound; and it may gradually form large clots, distending the parts with great irritation and pain, and making the haemorrhage more active. This secondary bleeding is so alarming and painful to the patient, and so troublesome to the surgeon, that the means of prevention ought to be carefully studied. It would be advisable not to perform an operation, even of minor importance, at once, on a patient engaged up to the time in active exertion and free living. Stimuli should be withdrawn for two or three days, the diet at the same time being light. Costive- ness should be guarded against. If the circulation is tran- quil, with soft and quiet pulse, the tongue being clean, even a serious operation may be undergone with safety! Do not stop to tie vessels during the operation, unless the haemorrhage should be inconvenient by obscuring and con- cealing the parts which are to be divided. After securing the principal vessels, if bleeding should stiU continue from many points, let the patient be put to bed, and leave the wound open for two, three, or more hours. It is sometimes advan- tageous to dress the wound after the patient is in bed, and even if the surface is slightly glazed. Then dress lightly without compresses, bandages, or any unnecessary covering Let the bed-clothes be light, and the apartment cool. If 16

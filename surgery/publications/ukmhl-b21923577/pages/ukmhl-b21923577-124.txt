If you leave a patient to himself, he covers the part with bandage, with dress, or bedclothes, so as to heat it, and convert the process into fomentation. Applications.â€”Cold water; fresh spring-water; vinegar and water (oxyerat); rose-water; iced water. Saturnine or lead lotion, popularly known and trusted under the name of Goulard.

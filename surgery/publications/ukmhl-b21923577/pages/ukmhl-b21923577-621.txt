BONES. 601 There was now a tumour between the bones, and imme- diately under the knee, with general fulness at the same part, and some swelling below. The most prominent part of the tumour was so elastic that no doubt existed of its containing fluid. There was some pain on pressing the tibia; no pulsa- tion in the swelling, but that of the tibial arteries was sup- pressed, though plain on the opposite side. There was general indisposition, with loss of appetite. The case appeared quite doubtful to two eminent surgeons, who saw the patient in consultation with me. The swelling now enlarged with a considerable protrusion standing out under the knee, without any definite boundary, and continuous so as to include the tibia in its basis. At this time the tibial arteries again pul- sated. There was much constitutional affection, with accele- rated pulse, loss of appetite, and bad nights. The sensation of fluidity was now so strongly marked that a deep puncture was made in the swelling, with the sanction of a surgeon called into consultation on the point; nothing escaped but blood. The necessity of amputation was now apparent, and I removed the limb about the 6th of April. He died of bleed- ing on the sixth day, from the femoral artery giving way in the night. The end of the vessel was found completely open, the ligature with its knot entire lying in the stump. A medullary growth, soft and brain-like, filled a large excavation in the head of the tibia. It extended forwards to form the tumour, and backwards under the calf, just at the division of the popliteal artery, thus accounting for the pulsation in the early stage of the swelling, for the suppression of the pulse in the tibial arteries so long as the tumour was confined by the strong fascia, and its subsequent return when the disease was no longer bound down by this structure. The inguinal glands, which had been observed to be slightly enlarged, were diseased, and presented a marbled appearance

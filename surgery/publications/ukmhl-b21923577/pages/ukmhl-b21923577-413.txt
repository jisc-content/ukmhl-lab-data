PRIMARY SORES. 393 the prepuce is generally a necessary part, the dead portion is separated, leaving a loss of substance, which is filled by granulation, and healing ensues without any liability to secondary symptoms. Such cases are rare. I had an instance under my care in St. Bartholomew's, in a healthy girl about twenty. There was a softish, dark slough on the inner side and lower part of the labium, about an inch in length, and at least half as broad, with little surrounding disturbance or pain.

A gentleman, about sixty, of good fortune and regular habits, who could not have contracted the disease from any low ^source, came to consult me from a few miles in the country, being in good general health. When he opened his dress, I immediately recognised the fcetor of sloughing phage- dena. There was a soft, dark-brown slough on the side&of the glans, about the size and form of a horse-bean, and, as it appeared when separated, about the depth of such a body.

The separation of the slough, and the repair of the chasm by granulation and cicatrization were soon complete, and nothing further ensued. A gentleman, twenty-two years of age, having had a suspi-

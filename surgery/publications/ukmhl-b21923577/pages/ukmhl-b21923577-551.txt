OPERATION. 531 the ounce may be employed, either with or without poultice. The latter may be useful in checking profuse discharge, but the most efficient remedy, when the surface is extremely painful, is the chloride of zinc in solution of sufficient strength to disorganize the surface. By such an applica- tion pain is often effectually relieved, a healthy granulating surface is produced, and cicatrization may be effected, though the hard margin and base of the cancer remain. The pre- servative fluid of the late Sir W. Burnett is a saturated solu- tion of chloride of zinc available for the purpose just men- tioned, diluted at first with three or four times the quantity of water. A solution of this chloride, disguised by colouring matter, was the escharotic employed by an American quack, who made a profitable visit to this country, as a cancer-curer, some years ago. He boldly attacked the disease in its state of scirrhus, largely destroying the external coverings with strong nitric acid, so as to come to the surface of the disease, of which he produced gradual disorganization by his red fluid. When the mass was thus disposed of, granulation and cicatrization ensued, and the cure was said to be com- plete. No long time elapsed before the real nature of this so-called cure showed itself in cancerous thickening and hardening of the surrounding region. As a means of removing diseased structure, the operation of excision appears to great advantage in comparison with the proceedings of the so-caUed cancer-curers, whether European or American. It is definite, certain, and far less painful. In the method by caustic an important part of the disease is left behind, as the scirrhous glands in the axilla cannot be got rid of in that way. There is a preliminary question whether operation is advisable at all, the performance of it having been sometimes subjected to conditions so strict as to approach nearly to a general prohibition. It cannot be

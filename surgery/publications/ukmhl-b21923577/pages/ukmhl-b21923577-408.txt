Its base is hard, and the edges a little prominent." Had he discarded preconceived notions and current doctrines, and applied to primary syphilis his great powers of original observation and reflection, he certainly would not have been satisfied with this meagre account of the subject, which is alto-ether imperfect, even in reference to one, and that by no means the most frequent form of the disease. The character of induration is seen in primary sores under different aspects; it may be in moderate degree, and might be called thickening with firmness rather than induration. There may be aeon- siderablelump under the skin, generally without redness, often not existing at first, but gradually developed.

Hence it is most frequent in the fold of prepuce behind the glans, and in the lining of the prepuce. It is hardly met with in the glans, where the quantity of this structure is extremely small, and it is but rarely seen in the common integument ot the prepuce.

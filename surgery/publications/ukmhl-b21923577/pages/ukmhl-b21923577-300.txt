Should inflamma- tory disturbance increase in violence and extent, free leeching may become necessary. If suppuration should occur in the finger or hand, par- ticularly in the theca, under fascia, or in any deep situation, it should be opened early. The part should be punctured, if the presence of matter is rendered probable by the symp- toms, without waiting until fluctuation is manifest. If high local inflammation be attended with constitutional disturbance of inflammatory character in a person of robust constitution and good health, general bleeding and other antiphlogistic measures may be advisable. A remarkable example of this kind is afforded by the following case: A gentleman of large frame, full muscular development, and in excellent health, scratched his thumb in sewing up the body of a female who had died of peritoneal disease. Most violent pain came on in the night, shooting up the limb, which swelled, and became hot, with great constitutional disturbance, marked by headache, restlessness, agitation, nausea, and shrunk countenance. He immediately lost thirty ounces of blood by venesection. On the next day the limb was greatly swelled, with inflammation of the absorbents. Leeches were applied to the part, and cold to the head.

I saw this gentleman, an intelligent and well- informed surgeon, on the following day, the fourth from the commencement of the attack. There was inflammatory enlargement and tension of the entire limb, with groat suffering. The patient believed that matter had formed in

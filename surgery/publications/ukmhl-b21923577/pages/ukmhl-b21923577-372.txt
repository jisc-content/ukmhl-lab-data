Here, however, the evidence is incomplete, as we do not know the exact state of the women. As we are quite in the dark respecting the actual venereal poison generally, as well as on the question whether there is one poison only or more than one, we are naturally led to inquire whether the great variety in the affections compre- hended under the general name of syphilis may not depend on differences in those who receive the infection, particularly in constitution and state of health, perhaps also in the management and treatment local and general; the character of the symptoms is less favorable, the disease is more in- tractable and enduring in the scrofulous than in those of healthy constitution.

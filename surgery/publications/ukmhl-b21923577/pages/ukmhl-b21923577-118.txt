98 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. is one of the first cases, in which I tried the remedy on the Italian plan, and it affords a good example of its advan- tages. In the winter of 1843-4, I saw a youth, about ten years of age, on the fifth or sixth day of a severe inflammatory attack in the chest. He had been similarly affected before, the disease having been obstinate and the convalescence tedious. He had now been actively and judiciously treated, had been bled three times, but without making any im- pression on the disease. There was a hard, dry cough, pre- venting rest, with a pulse of 110. I tried mercury, calomel, with James's powder, giving two grains every four or six hours. In three days salivation was produced, with some alleviation of symptoms, but no reduction of the pulse nor change in the "cough. I resorted to the tartrate of antimony, and gave a grain in an ounce of cinnamon water every four hours. The stomach bore it well, and I increased the dose in two days to a grain and a half. He went on with it nearly three weeks, the symptoms yielding regularly and most favorably. The issue of the casewasmore rapidly and completely successful than I could have anticipated. He took, during this time, five doses, on an average, in the twenty-four hours; sometimes the stomach rejected its contents, without effort or distress, once in twenty-four hours. It was necessary to give occasional aperients. . James's powder may be advantageously combined with calomel when the latter is employed as a purgative, or m a regular way, with a view to its power in arresting mflam- mation. . . , The tartrate of antimony in small doses is usefully joined with saline purgatives, such as Epsom salts. Another remedy, of still greater power, in the treatment ot inflammations is mercury, especially in the form of calomel. This remedy is very useful as a purgative, either alone or m

412 SECONDARY SYMPTOMS. SECONDARY OR CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS (LUES VENEREA). A portion of time more or less considerable generally elapses between the cessation of the primary and the appear- ance of secondary symptoms. The usual interval is from six to twelve weeks. Sometimes the secondary symptoms come on earlier, even before the primary have disappeared. It is not uncommon to see patients who have neglected all treatment and led an irregular life with primary sores and incipient syphilitic eruption. I once saw a young woman of sanguine temperament with primary sores, buboes, eruptions, sore throat, iritis, and swellings of the periosteum. In other instances, the appearance of secondary disease is delayed much beyond the time mentioned; to many months, or even longer. In the same way there may be long intervals be- tween the successive secondary symptoms, resulting from one infection. In one instance fourteen months had elapsed between the primary sore and a scaly syphilitic eruption; the patient had forgotten the sore, and did not remember it till questioned on the point. In another case there were nearly two years between a primary sore and a scaly eruption resulting from it. A gentleman was under my care for primary sores, followed by sore throat and eruption. He got well, and married at the end of a year from his recovery. In three years after his marriage he consulted me with symptoms of decided syphilitic character, a few scaly patches, two or three small circular sores on the legs, and one similar sore on the scapula. These gave way readily to mercury. In two instances of ulcerated sore throat, which I could not hesitate to regard as syphilitic, there had been intervals of eight and ten years without any symptoms. These, and many other analogous instances, must convince

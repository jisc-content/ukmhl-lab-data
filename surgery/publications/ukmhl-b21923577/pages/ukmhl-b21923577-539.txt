VAEIETIES IN DURATION. 519 skin just at the inferior margin of the pectoralis major, on the outside of the nipple, which was not retracted, although involved in the disease. The fold of the skin formed a deep cavity, three inches long, the surrounding integuments being puckered and drawn into large folds. The disease had lasted six or eight years, and had never caused pain. The drawing in of the skin had been noticed from the first. The wife of an innkeeper in Surrey had well-marked can- cerous affection, occupying the entire breast. The nipple was retracted, the skin adherent, and cutaneous tubercles had formed around. This disease had lasted twelve years, and ulceration had not yet taken place. She had enjoyed fair health, but died within a year from the time of my visit. A patient died under my care in this hospital in whom disease of cancerous nature had existed for about twenty years. The whole of one breast had been destroyed, the parts having been removed by ulceration and absorption. The same affection had taken place and had nearly destroyed the breast of the other side also.

She was about fifty when she died, so that it had begun about

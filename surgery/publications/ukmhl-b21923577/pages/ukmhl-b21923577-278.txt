258 HYDROPHOBIA. Dupuytren, Breschet, and Magendie produced no effect by rubbing wounds with the blood of rabid animals; tbey also injected tbe blood of rabid, dogs into the veins of healthy animals, without injury to the latter. Dr. Hertwig (of Berlin), however, found that rabies could be produced in the dog by injecting the blood of another affected with madness into the cellular substance. Out of eleven, thus inoculated, two died of rabies. ' Beitr'age zur n'ahern Kentniss der Wuth- Krankheit von Hertwig, M.D., Director of the Boyal Veteri- nary School, Berlin, in Hufeland's f Journal der praktischen Heilkunde', 1828. An analysis of this paper will be found in the ' Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal./ vol. xxxii, p. 378. We know the disease in the human subject only as the result of infection, that is, as conveyed, like smallpox or cowpox, by direct communication of poisonous matter from animals to man. Does it ever arise spontaneously inÂ»either case ? In man, some kind of aversion to or dread of liquids has been seen in rare instances, as a symptom of another affec- tion, and might be called symptomatic hydrophobia. But that very marked horror at water and other fluids, which constitutes so striking a feature in the fatal, affection ordi- narily called hydrophobia, is only known as resulting from direct appbcation of the poisonous saliva to a wounded or abraded surface. In animals it is rather difficult to determine the point; dogs, particularly, may be wounded without our knowing it. Some circumstances would lead us to suppose that in them, as in man, the source of the malady is extraneous, that it is pro- duced by infection, and does not originate spontaneously. The communication by infection is an ordinary and well- known occurrence, while the spontaneous origin is ohscure and doubtful.

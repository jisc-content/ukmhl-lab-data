PACE. 551 substance was quite healthy, and the skin, although thickened and firm, did not exhibit scirrhous change. An irritable condition of the skin caused some trouble in the management of the wound, which was necessarily treated as an open sore. The integuments below and in front of the wound were much inflamed, and large pustules formed on them, with most acute pain. It was found best at last to leave the part as much as possible open to the air, merely dusted with flour. The operation was performed on June 18, 1831, and she left town on July 20, with the wound about half healed, but in a per- fectly satisfactory state; it soon closed. The cicatrix was pefectly sound in 1835, and for many years afterwards. I believe that the patient is still living. The superficial nature of the disease in cases like the last, and in some instances of disease in the lips, might induce us to attempt their destruction by powerful escharotics, the chloride of zinc particularly. The use of the knife is prefer- able, as being definite and certain, removing all that ought to be taken away and no more. At the same time, it is far less painful. A married lady, about fifty, of delicate health, had a small but painful swelling on the left temple from the pressure of spectacles, which she had worn habitually; it was red, of circular form, and would not bear pressure. It was slightly elevated. It was about the size of a sixpence, the mass of induration being inconsiderable, and the ulceration not deep. It was, however, very painful, and thus it became necessary to adopt effectual means of removing what would now probably be called an epithelial cancer. Her sister had died of cancer in the breast, the disease having returned after an operation, and this had given her a thorough dread of the knife. The chloride of zinc was therefore used, which certainly destroyed as much, both in surface and depth, as would have been

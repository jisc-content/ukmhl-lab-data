24 THE NATUEE AND cumstances combined in the definition now mentioned might properly be reduced to one, altered functions and secre- tions necessarily implying changes in an organ. I can entertain no doubt that if our knowledge of diseases were perfect, we should be able to trace in every instance altered functions or secretions to changes in the state of organs. Unfortunately, we not unfrequently see impaired function when we cannot ascertain the condition of the organ, more particularly in internal diseases, while in other instances there are manifest symptoms of disease, without our being able to determine its exact seat. In this imperfect state of knowledge we are obliged to admit alterations of function and secretion as diseases, and to give them names without implying that the changes take place independently of alteration in the organs. Thus it happens that nosological catalogues contain in addition to the names of well-ascer- tained and localised diseases, an abundance of others which denote mere symptoms. In considering the morbid changes which the body may undergo, we must bear in mind that they differ much in degree. There may be change of such a kind that the alteration will be visible after death, or it may merely affect the living condition, and leave no traces distinguishable after death. I do not mean to represent that the function of an organ can be altered, while the organ itself remains in a perfectly healthy state; for what are functions? merely the organs in a state of exertion. Perfect functions imply a normal condition of the organs, and vice versd. To say that functions are disordered without any change in organs, would be to assert that an effect had taken place without a cause. The morbid changes that may take place in the body may be divided into the more serious, which are visible on examination after death, and, the slighter, which affect

510 CANCEEOUS CACHEX1 A—ORGANIC CHANGES. The active period, in which cancerous disease is spreading to surrounding parts, is attended with pain increasing in severity and duration: the suffering described as a terrible pain, is aggravated and becomes constant in the ulcerative stage, in which the morbid state of constitution or cachexia, which has been gradually advancing, becomes fully established.

Under the microscope it exhibits an abundance ot nucleated cells, which are considered to afford unequivocal evidence of cancerous character. The disease may appear as a distinct and circumscribed tumour ; or dense cellular

102 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. A. Carlisle's plan of blistering by means of iron plunged in hot water, which act immediately. Sinapisms operate more quickly than blisters : according to tbeir strength and the duration of the application they either redden the skin or blister. To afford a reasonable chance of success, the new irritation must be more powerful than that which it is designed to supersede. An active inflammation, in its full development, yet unchecked, with its train of sympathetic effects, cannot be stopped by the minor disturbance of a blister. Blisters, under such circumstances, instead of checking the disease, increase the general disturbance, and thus aggravate the patient's sufferings. This mode of proceeding, then, is to be resorted to when depletion and the other means already described have lessened the local disturbance and removed the constitutional effects; towards the end of inflammation, when it seems likely to become chronic; or as a remedy against the pain and sense of weakness which may remain after the other symptoms have come to an end. Another caution in the use of blisters is not to place them so near the suffering organ as to include it in the circle of irritation. I have seen aggravation of suffering from neglect of this rule, in placing a blister on the temple so near to the eye as to increase the irritation in the part. The assemblage of measures just detailed, both dietetic and remedial, con- stitutes the antiphlogistic treatment or plan, the treatment opposed to inflammation. The means which refer to diet and general management constitute the antiphlogistic regimen. Local applications.-mxo^h these are of much less im- portance than general means in the treatment of inflammation, they are often useful auxiliaries; this is particularly the case in external inflammation ; to a great part of internal inflam- matory affections they are obviously inapplicable.

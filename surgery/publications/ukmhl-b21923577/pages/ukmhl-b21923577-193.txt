CHRONIC ABSCESS. 173 and the cure proceeds favorably, though not so rapidly or uninterruptedly as in genuine phlegmonous abscess. A patient, about forty, and previously healthy, came into St. Bartholomew's, under my care, with a large abscess of four weeks' duration. It filled the space between the scapula and spine; it was firm and resisting, so that fluctuation was ob- scure. He was in great pain night and day, complaining of tightness on the shoulder and back, rendering him unable to move from the position in which he lay, nearly on his face, with the head and upper limb supported. A free incision, by which twenty-four ounces of well-formed pus were discharged, gave immediate and perfect relief. The escape of matter had nearly ceased in three weeks. About the same time, I had under my care a woman, between thirty and forty, with great and most painful enlargement of the thigh, of not less than ten weeks' duration. The increase of size began in the upper part of the thigh; it was firm, as if involving the bone; and the severity of the pain, which impaired appetite and rest, favoured the supposition. The nature of the affection at this time was quite obscure. The swelling gradually extended, so as to occupy nearly the whole front and inner side of the limb; suppuration was now discovered, and pain was less, though still considerable. I let out thirty* ounces of good pus by a free puncture, deeming that the only resource, although the result, considering the great extent of the mis- chief, appeared altogether uncertain.

The flow of matter ceased gradually, health and strength returning in the same proportion. Anomalous cases of suppuration, presenting a singular contrast between the slowness of their progress and de- velopment and the perfect character of the contained pus

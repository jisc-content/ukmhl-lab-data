CHEONIC ABSCESS. 171 case to its natural course. By some this is preferred, as a general rule of practice. At all events, if the question of openiug is doubtful, it will be safer to abstain. If the col- lection, already considerable, is still increasing, without any tendency to break, open it surgically, in order to limit the extent of mischief. When the matter has all escaped, close the opening carefully with adhesive plaster, to take the chance of healing by adhesion. The course now recommended does not differ materially, so far as the abscess is concerned, from that proposed by Mr. Abernethy for the treatment of psoas and lumbar abscesses, except that in his plan the opening would probably be made earlier. He punctured cautiously, to prevent passage of air into the cyst, allowed the contents to flow out without squeezing, and closed the wound carefully. Puncture was repeated once or more, when matter had accumulated to a smaller amount than at first. The proposed object was to give opportunity for gradual contraction of the cyst, with the intention of opening it freely when much reduced in size, and then leaving it to heal by granulations. The almost constant complication of carious vertebrae with these abscesses sufficiently accounts for the want of success which has led to the abandonment of this plan. Some surgeons prefer evacuating the matter by means ot a trochar. The only objection to this is the frequent inter- mixture in these cases with the fluid pus of flakes which may be too large to pass through even a full-sized canula. In one of the great hospitals of Paris a practice is almost universally resorted to of employing drainage tubes which are about equal in size to the largest urethra bougie made of India rubber, open at both ends, and sufficiently long to enter the abscess fairly after it has been evacuated, and to leave one or more inches on the outside. The object is to

OSTEOID CANCER. 0.31 sidered with greater detail, both anatomical and pathological, by Mr. Paget. In a case which occurred under my own care in the hospital, and has been described by Mr. Stanley, a tumour composed of soft fibrous and dense osseous substance completely sur- rounded the lower part of the femur. The whole series of femoral, inguinal, and lumbar absorbent glands were con- verted into osseous tumours, identical in structure with the swelling round the femur, both being composed almost wholly of a solid, dull white, chalk-like osseous substance, which in the femur was continuous with a similar deposit in the medul- lary and cancellous structure of the bone. I am indebted to my friend Mr. Savory for the following case of osteoid cancer now under his care as the present sheet is passing through the press. It is so clear and full, without prolixity, that I should have been happy to adorn my work with other equally instructive and interesting narratives from the same hand. Case of Osteoid Cancer of the Femur. A seaman, forty-five years of age, was admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital with a tumour which occupied the lower two thirds of the left thigh. It was of an elongated oval shape, and well-defined; the integuments were healthy, and moved freely over it. The tumour evidently involved the femur, and felt as hard as bone. Its bulk was greatest just above the knee-joint, and from this part it could be traced upwards until it appeared gradually to subside upon the sur- face of the femur, at a short distance below the greater tro- chanter. No enlargement of the femoral or other glands, or any disease elsewhere, could be detected. The man first became aware of the existence of a swelling at the lower part

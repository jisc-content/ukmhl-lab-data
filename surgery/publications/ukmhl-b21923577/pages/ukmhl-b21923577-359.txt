In gout, the local affection almost invariably appears spontaneously, as the simple result of the constitutional disposition, while in rheumatism it is more commonly caused by external agencies, such as cold and moisture, or unusual exertion. In spontaneous cases, the swelling of the joints, as in gout, is preceded by disorder of the digestive organs and fever. If blood is taken in the state of general disturbance preceding the rheumatic attack, or at an early period of the disease, it exhibits the inflammatory character. In rheumatism the synovial membrane is the seat of disease, the external coverings being often unchanged, and the pain frequently slight, while in gout the external parts are greatly swollen and red, with excruciating pain, but no evidence of effusion into the articular cavity. There is less tendency to affections of internal organs in rheumatism than in gout, with the important exception of the heart and pericardium, both pericarditis and endocarditis being fre- quently induced, especially in young subjects. The eyes suffer in both cases. In gout the affection commences in, and is confined to the iris, while rheumatic ophthalmia begins in the sclerotica and extends to the cornea and iris. The latter affection yields to ordinary remedies, especially in the outset. Should these have failed, and the complaint have been tedious, great and sudden benefit is often experienced from powder of bark and carbonate of soda in five or six grain doses three or four times daily. The treatment of rheumatism in the early period will con- sist, like that of gout, in removing the unhealthy state of system on which the local affections depend. The moderate loss of blood may be advantageous in some cases, especially if we see grounds for fear that the pericardium or heart may become affected, though local bleeding by leeches is generally

596 FUNG-US I17EMAT0DES. than at an earlier or later age. I have already alluded to two cases, of which one terminated fatally in the first, and the other in the second year (see p. 581). The disease may be of the softer or firmer kinds, it may advance more or less rapidly, hut seldom exists for more than a year without having attained a magnitude which leads to the question of operation. The enlargement is of uniform surface, and covered by healthy scrotum. It is not a painful affection. I have never seen it make its way externally, though in an instance where the disease had been left to its full development and secondary formations had taken place in various parts, the original tumour was full ten inches in length. The part is generally removed by operation, although no instance is known of permanent cure from that proceeding. The wound heals in the usnal way, and the cicatrix remains sound, but death is gradually brought on by a large development of disease in the abdomen covering the spinal column behind the peritoneum, and generally involving the pelvic and lumbar glands. The duration of life after the operation varies, as will be seen in the three following cases, of which the last presents the greatest prolongation within my own experience. Case I.â€”A gentleman, fifty years of age, of healthy ap- pearance, but bearing scars in the neck, indicating that the glands in that region had suffered considerably in early life, consulted me for an enlargement of the testicle to the size of a fist, which had been gradually increasing for two years, mercury having been taken so as to affect the system, and the iodide of potassium having also been given freely without any influence on the complaint.

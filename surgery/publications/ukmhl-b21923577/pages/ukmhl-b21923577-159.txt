FEVER. 139 accumulations and morbid secretions; and the free discharges they produce relieve the vascular system and thus dispense with the necessity of further loss of blood. The notion that purgatives cause inflammation or ulcera- tion of the intestines is totally unfounded. I never saw a case in which such a thing could be even suspected.

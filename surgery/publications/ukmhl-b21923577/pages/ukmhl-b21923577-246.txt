226 MORTIFICATION. with it, I may say that I have seen it in at least twenty males." Causes.â€”The disease is most common in those who have heen free livers. To this effect, Mr. Pott observes, " I have much more often found it in the rich and voluptuous, than in the labouring poor, and more often in great eaters than in free drinkers." It happens, however, not infrequently in old and healthy persons, who have led a regular and temperate life, depending on the diseased condition of the arterial coats which has been already mentioned. Mr. Pott's excellent practical tract shows that inquiries into morbid changes after death had not begun in his time. In speaking of causes, he says, "It has by some been supposed to arise from ossification of vessels; but for this opinion I could never find any foundation but mere conjecture." The view of this subject taken by Baron Dupuytren has already been alluded to on a previous occasion. Regarding the affection as proceeding from inflammation of the arteries, he calls it " gangrene symp- tomatique," observing that it may occur where the arteries are not ossified, and not follow where they have undergone this change. He describes the arterial disease as being preceded and accompanied by severe pain in the limb, and indicated by local changes, such as diminished pulsation, diminution in size of the vessels, and hardness of the tubes, which point out the seat and nature of the affection. He describes the changes produced in the vessels as ascertained by dissection, particularly their obstruction by lymphatic concretions to a considerable distance from the mortified part. The writings of Mr. Pott, and the rational mode of treating senile gangrene followed in England in conformity with his valuable experience and instructions, seem to have been unknown to Dupuytren, or ignored by him, although fifty years had elapsed from the death of our great surgeon. Thus, he con-

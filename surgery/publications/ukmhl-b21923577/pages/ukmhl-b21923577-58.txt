38 THE NATURE AND you survey the circumstances which denote the existence of disease/and which may be called generally its external signs. You direct attention to the circumstances under which it has arisen, and you investigate the occurrences that have taken place previously. You next proceed to notice those changes in the organ which are recognisable by examination.

Increased frequency of making water, swelling of the absorbent glands, the testicles, are secondary symptoms of the same disorder. In looking at the symptoms of disease, practical persons par- ticularly turn their attention to such as constantly take place in each particular disease, which have been called Pathogno- monic They are inseparable from the disease; their presence therefore indicates that the disease exists, while their absence shews that the disease is not present. Secondary symptoms, for example, cannot be pathognomonic. Even symptoms that belong to the organs immediately affected, are not always the same in every case; thus few come under the description of pathognomonic. These are mostly found in external disease, and are referable to what we ascertain by surgical examination. Thus, for example, if a patient have pain in making water, and the water is interrupted

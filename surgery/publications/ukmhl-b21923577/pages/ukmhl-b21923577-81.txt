ITS EFFECTS AND VAKIETIES. 61 The swelling may be considerable or slight, according to the degree of inflammation present and the differences of texture; as, for instance, in inflammation of a mucous, serous, or fibrous membrane, the bronchial membrane, the pleura, or the sclerotic coat of the eye. # Heat varies similarly in degree • the hot, burning sensation m an acute abscess may be contrasted with the absence of any increase of temperature in a chronic purulent formation. Pain may be violent or entirely absent. Generally, the more intense the inflammation the more violent the pain. But the difference in the degree of pain partly depends on difference of texture. In proportion as the part is more firm and dense and more copiously supplied with nerves, the pain is greater, and vice versa. Thus, in paronychia the pain is extreme; in inflammation of the conjunctiva it may be entirely absent; in that of the sclerotica it is dull, heavy, and II.

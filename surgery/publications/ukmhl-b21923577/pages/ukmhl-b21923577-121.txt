TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 101 Colchicum acts on the alimentary canal and on the kidneys; on the former violently, and even dangerously, in free doses. It is chiefly employed in gout and rheumatism. Counter-irritation.â€”It has been observed, when a new disease appears, that one previously existing is lessened or removed. When the testicle inflames in gonorrhoea, the affection of the urethra subsides or ceases. The inflammation of the testicle has been ascribed to the stoppage of the dis- charge. It is more probable that the urethral disease stops because the testicle has become inflamed. Inflam- mation of the eye in a child ceases when the ears become sore, and vice versa; internal disorders, or an attack of gout or rheumatism, are soon arrested by an eruption, and the reverse. We imitate this process of nature by making an artificial new disease in order to get rid of a previously existing malady. This is counter-irritation, i.e. a new-irritation contra or opposed to one previously existing. Revulsion, from revello, implies that the new disease tears away, forcibly displaces, the other. Derivation, from the Latin, means turning aside a stream. Leeches are supposed to draw the fluids from an inflamed part to the outlets produced by their application, and a similar action is ascribed to the discharges caused by counter- irritation. Thus, counter-irritation, revulsion, and deriva- tion, are allied in meaning. Counter-irritation in acute inflammation is generally ac- complished by blistering the skin, either by means of a plaster in which the cantharides or Lytto, the irritating material, are incorporated, or by a blistering tissue or fluid which owe their power to the active principle (cantharidine) extracted from the Spanish insects. There are other means e.g. hot or boiling water or pure Liquor Ammonia or'Sir

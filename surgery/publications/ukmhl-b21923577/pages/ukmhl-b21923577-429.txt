BUBO. 409 <vith a primary sore, participates in the treatment adopted for the latter, whether simply antiphlogistic or mercurial; and the swelling is dispersed without any means being especially directed to it, in ordinary cases, when properly treated from an early period of the affection. When a sore requiring the use of mercury is accompanied by buboes, mercurial frictions are recommended, on the supposition that the local influence of the remedy on the glands through which it passes, will promote their cure. Mr. Hunter seems to have relied on this as an invariable effect; and it certainly happens often, but by no means uniformly. When the sore has healed, it is not necessary to persevere with mercury; especially when the bubo, after having suppurated and discharged externally, is healing kindly. When buboes occur without primary sores, are they to be regarded as a venereal symptom ? Ought mercury to be used ? I have seen so many instances of glandular swellings, without primary ulceration, occupying both groins in indi- viduals otherwise healthy, after exposure to infection, that I am satisfied venereal poison may affect the glands without causing any other primary symptom, either as ulceration or dis- charge. Such swellings, when left to themselves, may remain a long time without any change. I do not know whether they can give rise to secondary symptoms. They should be treated with mercury â€¢ and they are decidedly benefited by mercurial frictions and plasters. Mr. Carmichael, however says, "If the tumour in the groin has not been preceded by an ulcer on the genitals, mercury is unnecessary, and may be highly injurious." (< Venereal Diseases/ p. 310.) I cannot understand on what ground this positive statement rests assuming, as it does, the denial of venereal character to the glandular affections in question. Do we know how primary sores are produced ? A poisonous matter is applied

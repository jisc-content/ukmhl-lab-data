CHAPTER II. INFLAMMATION , ITS NATURE AND SYMPTOMS. Tee causes of disease, however various they may be, iu the great majority of instauees disturb the orcula- tiou of the parts iu which they occur. They are said to stimulate, to excite, to irritate, to inflame. All injuries and all external irritations produce inflammation, and a great variety of internal causes, of which, in many cases we cannot ascertain the nature, or form a satisfactory appreciation, produce the same result. Inflammations, again, occur in certain cases, if we may use such au expression, sympa- thetically : they seem to be effects or symptoms of a general disorder existing iu the frame. Of all the various diseases which constitute the catalogues of onr nosologies, the greater part consist either of inflammation in particular organs, or of Luges which are produced by it; and there are few indeed in which inflammation in some part is not either a cause or consequence, a concomitant circumstance, or a mode o- When I say mode of cure, I allude to the production of inflammation artificially as the means of remedying d.sea.o This is a circumstance peculiar to inflammation, and not belonging to other morbid affections. By external applica- tions we can excite inflammations similar to those uhel arise from internal causes. We cannot, however, ... the same way, produce organic changes, such as cancer, fungus, htematorlcs, exostosis.

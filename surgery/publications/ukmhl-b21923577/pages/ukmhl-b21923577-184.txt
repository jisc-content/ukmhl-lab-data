164, CHRONIC ABSCESS, swelling near the anus, which had formed without pain. On March 31st, he had felt something unusual in the seat of the disease. A swelling came and gradually increased till April 6th, when I saw him. There was a considerable enlarge- ment at the side and towards the front of the anus, of a deep red colour, soft in the centre, and firmer in the circumference. He had not been indisposed, and had felt nothing more than a slight prickling sensation. I evacuated about three table- spoonfuls of thick, white, inodorous pus, and the part healed soundly. Pain sometimes precedes and accompanies these slow sup- purations, and of course it may be expected to occur more or less considerably in conjunction with external evidences of dis- turbance in those which lie midway between the two extremes. The matter of chronic abscess is contained in a cyst, which is organized as in the phlegmonous, but is thinner and less dense Such a cyst affords a feeble barrier to the matter ; hence the indefinite increase of these collections, especially when under unyielding parts, as fascia, and when they are situated in loose cellular texture. When the cyst of an abscess is so thin, its existence is hardly recognised by external examination. There is a strong contrast between the so t- ness and indefinite outline of such a collection and the thick solid wall of adhesive inflammation which bounds a phlegmonous abscess. The thinness of the cyst and the want of disposition to come to the surface leadto an almost indefinite, extension of the mischief in some situations, as in the col- lections called psoas and lumbar abscesses, m which the increase is favoured by gravity.

357 TREATMENTâ€”MERCURY. MERCURY; ITS PREPARATIONS, MODES OP ADMINISTRATION AND EFFECTS. Mercury is employed in the treatment of syphilis, either simply as a local application or as a remedy capable of pro- ducing a powerful influence on the system ; and through that influence, of arresting the progress of the disease, and ulti- mately curing it. In the metallic form it is inert; it pro- duces no effect upon the human body; it may be swallowed in large quantity, and will do neither good nor harm. It exercises no influence except when it is combined with oxygen, or with an acid. Of the forms in which mercury is used as a local appli- cation, perhaps the most common is that ordinarily called the black ivash, an unchemical combination of calomel with lime- water, the proportion being fifteen grains of calomel to the ounce. This is used as a lotion, by dipping lint into it and applying it to sores. If not the very best, it is one of the best modes of employing mercury locally. Another lotion, called yellow wash, is a combination of bichloride of mer- cury (corrosive sublimate) with lime-water, in the proportion of two grains to an ounce. This is used in the same way as the preceding. We have the mercurial ointment, which, however, is not frequently applied to venereal sores. There is also the red precipitate ointment (Unguentum Hydrargyri Nitrico-oxidi), which is in general use; and the citrine oint- ment (Unguentum Hydrargyri Nitratis), which is not fro- quenty employed in venereal cases. Another mode in which mercury is employed locally, is by fumigation; and for this purpose the red sulphuret of mercury or cinnabar (Hydrargyri Sulphurctum rubrum), is commonly

326 SCROFULA. I have been surprised at finding even medical persons sometimes questioning the advantages derivable from change of air, either in scrofula or in other diseases. It is stated in explanation of this doubt that the air, when analysed chemically, presents the same elements in all the varieties of situation, for instance in the heart of London or on Sabs- bury Plain. This will be readily admitted, but there may be something besides the mere proportion of gases capable of acting favorably or unfavorably on human health.

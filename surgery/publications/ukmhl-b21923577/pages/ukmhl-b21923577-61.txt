DIVISIONS OF DISEASE. 41 out the changes which have been produced in the part imme- diately affected, or in others connected with it; we ascertain what may be called their pathological condition. These inquiries have materially contributed to give us correct notions respecting the nature of diseases, and have dispelled the fanciful views in which disease was attributed to supposed alterations of fluids, or to the condition of the vital proper- ties; for it has shown in most cases that material changes have been produced in the organs of the body. These examinations complete the history of disease. In some cases we find no visible change, but this negative circumstance is of use in detecting error. Valuable as is the knowledge imparted by these examina- tions, you must not consider them, of the first importance; clinical observation affords the best means of ascertaining and appreciating the changes caused by disease. Examina- tion after death, in fatal cases, completes the history and our knowledge of the matter, and is thus a useful auxiliary source of information. In order to discover the exact seat and nature of disease, close attention is often required in discriminating between the affections of contiguous organs, in determining which among the several affections incidental to a part is that present in the case, and in distinguishing between primary and second- ary diseases. This branch of the inquiry is called the dia- gnosis, and the circumstances which lead us to establish the distinction may be called the diagnostic signs. Wh^ we have thoroughly investigated a disease, tracing it- history, ascertaining the symptoms, observing its progress and changes, together with the effect of treatment, we shall be able to form a rational opinion respecting its duration and effec s; we shall be prepared to foretell or prognosticate the event and termination, whether favorable or otherwise in

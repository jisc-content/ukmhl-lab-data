75 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. order to save life. This is especially the case when it occurs in such parts as the brain, the lungs, or the heart, the larynx, stomach, intestines, or abdomen. Again, the various effects of inflammation, particularly mortification, suppuration, and interstitial depositions, cause changes of structure, which impair or destroy function, although inflammation should be stopped. Even the least considerable of these effects, effusion of lymph, may produce organic alterations seriously and permanently injurious; and these take place occasionally when the inflammation is far from its highest degree. Such effusion may consolidate and harden parts which are naturally loose and soft in structure; it may cause adhesion between those which are distinct, although contiguous, and it may render transparent struc- tures opaque. The restorative powers of joints are comparatively weak; it is long before a knee or elbow once inflamed regains the perfect smoothness and polish of the internal surfaces, and the flexibility of the surrounding structures, which are necessary to the perfect freedom and strength of the articulation. Inflammation of the cornea, the iris, or the retina, though not very violent, would come to a natural end; but it might lessen or destroy the transparency of the first, it might contract or close the pupil, it might impair or extinguish the sensibility of the nervous structure to light, entailing, according to its degree, imperfection or loss of sight. If inflammation of the hand be allowed to pursue its course or be treated inefficiently in its earlier stage, it may cause mischiefs of the most serious and distressing kinds, gluinÂ°- tendons to the fibrous sheaths or bones in or on which they should play, and converting them, with fascia, muscles, cellular texture, and skin into a hard mass, with irremediable stiffness if not immobility of the affected portions.

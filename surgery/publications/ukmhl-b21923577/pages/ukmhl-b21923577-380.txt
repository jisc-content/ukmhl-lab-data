The blue pill, although mild, is more active: four or five grains may he given two or three times a day, and it may he substituted for the gray powder when that seems inefficient: sometimes to each blue pill there maybe added a grain of .calomel. This last substance, so well known under its own name,now called Hydrargyri Chloridum, is more active than the two preceding, and therefore available when the object is to mercurialize the patient quickly: it may be given in doses of two grains combined with the fourth or third of a grain of opium, three or four times in the twenty-four hours. A similar addition of opium may be necessary to the blue pill or gray powder. Calomel may be given in grain or half-grain doses two or three times daily, without or with a little opium. Sometimes calomel has been administered in a single nightly dose of three, four, or five grains, with one grain of opium. For producing the desired influence of mercury on the con- stitution as an antisyphilitic remedy, I prefer the gray powder or the blue pill, seldom resorting to calomel. The external plan by friction is equally advantageous and perhaps safer, but patients are seldom willing to adopt it, especially as the judicious employment of the internal remedies answers all purposes. The 1 London Pharmacopoeia' has an iodide and a biniodide of mercury: the former may be given in the dose of a grain three times daily, and the quantity may be gradually in- â€¢ creased to three grains. Its effect on the constitution is not distinguishable from that of mercury. The latter is used as an external remedy in the form of ointment. The bichloride of mercury, or corrosive sublimate, is another form employed in certain cases, though it is an irritant poison, even in quantities not to be called large. It must be given in small doses, and its effects must be cautiously observed. In this country it is not used in the general treatment of

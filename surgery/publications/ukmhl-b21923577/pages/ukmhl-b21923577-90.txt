70 INFLAMMATION, Hence, ia addition to the external agency, a particular state of body is necessary to produce an aptitude, or predis- position to disease, and thus it has been necessary to divide causes into immediate, direct, or exciting, and remote or predisposing. . The latter may be natural peculiarity of constitution. All human beings are not organized alike. Nature has nothing of the quaker taste. She has no delight in uniformity of colour, figure, stature. She has not cut out all mankind by one pattern; on the contrary, her law is variety, as we observe unmistakeably throughout creation. Variety m or- ganization and vital actions not less than in form, stature, functions, dispositions, and endowments. Thus the state of health, as the general result of the exercise of all the organs instead of being an uniform condition, is different m each individual. , Such varieties as are common to many persons are called temperaments; the sanguineous,nervous,phlegmatic,melan- cholic; those of individuals are idiosyncrasies. As peculiarities are hereditary, so is the disposition to particular diseases in families. Morbid dispositions or diatheses are closely allied to dif- ference, of temperament, but they make a nearer approach to disease, as in scrofula, gout, rheumatism. The two latter may be original or acquired. BispositL to particular kinds of disease may ar,se from age and sex, natural vigour or weakness of frame, donate and situation. . .

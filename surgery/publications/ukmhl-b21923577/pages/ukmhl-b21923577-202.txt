182 ULCERATION. painful. The ulcer enlarges in extent and in depth, the edges remaining red and painful; the surface is yellowish, whitish, or darker, irregular, and sometimes presenting shreds of decaying textures; the edge is sharp. There is a thin, serous, or slightly opaque discharge, which is some- times bloody. When ulceration stops, the breach which it has caused is filled up, and the surface is restored by other processes, which are nearly similar under the four following circumstances: 1st. On the surfaces of chasms produced by ulceration; 2ndly, on that left by the separation of a slough; 3rdly, on the exposed surface of an abscess or fistula; 4thly, on that of a wound with loss of substance, or separation of the sides. A new material springs up at various points m small portions, gradually becoming more numerous, and coalescing into a more or less uniform covering of soft red substance, which rises on its surface into rounded or pointed prominences of various size, and kept moist by secretion of pus. The pro- minences are granulations, and the process itself is called granulation. The secretion of pus is not an invariable con- comitant of the process; it is not seen in the case of ulcera- tion of the articular cartilages, or in that of the cornea. This process of restoration consists in the deposition of the plastic material, fibrine, formerly called coagulable or organizable lymph, and in its organization; it soon pos- sesses blood-vessels, absorbents, and nerves. The effusion of fibrine is analogous to what occurs in inflammation; there is at all events increased vascular activity, manifested by greater redness. Dr. J. Thomson found the heat near the edge of a sore two degrees higher than in the rest of the^ limb. (f Lectures on Inflammation/ p. 407). Blood-vessels are visible in granulations to the naked eye, and may be seen in immense number with magnifying-

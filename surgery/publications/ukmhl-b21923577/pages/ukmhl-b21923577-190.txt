170 CHRONIC ABSCESS. spontaneous inflammations, that is, they arise without obvious cause. They occur, not in healthy individuals, but in those whose constitutions are naturally feeble, especially in the scrofulous, among whom suppurations, although sometimes active, are more commonly chronic. They may also occur in those whose naturally good constitutions have been im- paired by various causes. Thus, in both descriptions of cases, there is constitutional imperfection, which accounts satis- factorily for the peculiar character and progress of the disease. Hence you understand the epithets good and laud- able applied to the thick pus of phlegmonous suppuration, as contrasted with the thin, wheylike or watery matter of chronic ftbs cess â€¢ The treatment presents much greater difficulty than that of phlegmonous abscess, inasmuch as we have to contend, not merely with the local mischief, but with the constitu- tional unsoundness to which that owes its origin. Our objects will be to strengthen those in whom the frame has been origi- nally feeble, and to restore health where it has been impaxred by depressing influences or bad habits. The circulation should be invigorated by nutritious and generous diet, with such kind and amount of stimuli as can be taken without excitement The aid of strengthening medicines, particularly bark and steel, will often be required. Other vegetable tonics and bitters, with the dilute mineral acids, may also be useful. Residence in pure air, more particularly that of the sea-side, is advantageous, with as much of open-air exercise or enjoyment as the general health and state of the disease will admit. If the stomach and bowels require assistance, it must be given by such mild means as will not weaken. Whcnthe constitution has been invigorated by these measures, the abscess will remain stationary, or sometimes even lessen. If the matter should be coming forwards, we may leave the

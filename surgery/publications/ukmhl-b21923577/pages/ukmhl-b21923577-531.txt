ORGANIC CHANGES. 511 bands may extend from it into the neighbouring cellular and adipous texture, which, although not diseased, is thickened, indurated, and closely adherent to the scirrhous mass. This change embraces also the skin and part of the pectoral muscle. In old cases of extensive disease, this thickening passes in the intervals, of the ribs to the pleura and the peritoneum lining the diaphragm, which may be thickened and tubercu- lated. Morbid change of the same character as that of the original disease is found also in the absorbent glands. As the lymphatics of the mammary gland pass partly into the chest at the intervals of the costal cartilages, the small glands in the course of the internal mammary vessels are found to be scirrhous after death. White and firmish tuber- cles of various size, are found both on the surface and throughout the substance of the lungs and liver. The uterus is not unfrequently diseased, and tubercles have been seen on the external surface of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines. In a patient of forty, who died in the hospital two or three weeks after admission, with active mischief in the chest in less than two years from the commencement of her disease, the whole right mammary gland considerably enlarged, was a mass of scirrhous hardness throughout, fixed to the'side with the skin tense, adherent, and with slight blush of red. The axillary glands, converted into a hard mass filled the axilla. There was inflammation of the pleura W!th seropurulent effusion and scirrhus of the cervix uteri. A corpulent woman, of fifty-five, who had lived as a cook in a gentleman's family for many years, had the mammary gland removed in the hospital for a scirrhous growth the size of a walnut, which had begun within the year. She died

586 FUNGUS HiBMATODES. an operation was determined on in consultation, and I per- formed it on October 13th, beginning with an incision about eight inches in length, over the middle of the tumour, in the long axis of the limb. The sartorius was exposed and divided, when the anterior and lateral connexions of the mass were quickly severed. The tumour presented a smooth, circum- scribed outline; it was hard, but with an elastic feel. A slight incision made into its substance was followed by free arterial hemorrhage. In order to separate the mass from its deep posterior connexions, I held it upwards and kept the edge of the knife close on its surface; a violent bleeding quickly ensued from the femoral artery which was cut across j it was immediately seized and secured by ligature. The deepest attachments still remained, and the whole disease could not have been removed without cutting through the large vessels above the swelling, a proceeding which would have been out of the question even if the patient had not already lost a large quantity of blood during the operation. I therefore closed the wound, with firm support of the parts by adhesive plaster and bandage. He was removed to bed in a very low state, vomiting much, and complaining of pain in the knee, but not in the seat of disease. On the 20th the whole tumour had perished, and was converted into a black mass, surrounded by a healthy granulating surface. This slough which was easily removed on November 10th was as large as an ordinary orange, and perforated by a large artery, and by another canal lying close to it with less dis- tinct coats; these were evidently the femoral vessels. On December 13th, the wound was nearly closed and he could walk with a stick. He was discharged well on the 19th, when he returned to his residence in North Wales, where he died from return of disease in the thigh in eight weeks. Both lungs were studded with larger and smaller masses of

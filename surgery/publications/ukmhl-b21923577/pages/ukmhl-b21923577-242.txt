MORTIFICATION. this was a stout young Irishman, of excellent constitution, and therefore a fit subject for an attempt to save life by an operation; and although the integument was not in a per- fectly satisfactory state where it was necessary to amputate, I thought I would give him a chance. I removed the arm at the shoulder joint, the cellular membrane being discoloured and infiltrated with a yellow fluid in the part where the incision was made. The case succeeded perfectly, and the patient reovered. I have seen other instances in which amputation has been successfully performed in traumatic gangrene before morti- fication had stopped, and consequently before the line of demarcation had taken place between -the dead and the living parts. Several such cases are recorded by Larrey, in his "Memoirs of Military Surgery;" and of late years there has been an accession of evidence on the same point; so that I have no hesitation in saying that in patients of healthy constitution, where gangrene arises from external causes simply, you must disregard the rule of waiting for the line of demarcation. Senile Gangrene. â€” Such is the name under which an affection of common occurrence is now universally known, although our great surgeon, Pott, to whom we are indebted for the first distinct account of the subject, which, although short, is so clear, rational, and judicious, that it has not yet been surpassed, so far from having employed the epithet senile, observes simply, "It frequently happens to persons advanced in life, but is by no means peculiar to old age." It is a form of dry or chronic mortification, and is frequently spoken of as spontaneous, a character which belongs to it in the great majority of instances. Mr. James, of Exeter, a pupil of St. Bartholomew's, speaks of it under the appro- priate designation of chronic sphacelus, in his valuable and

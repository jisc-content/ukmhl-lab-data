72 INFLAMMATION, The causes, nature and progress, of these unhealthy states of constitution, and the mode of managing them, form so important a suhject, that I shall defer its consideration at present, as it would interrupt the general view of inflam- mation, and I shall take it up separately after concluding the latter. According to the differences in their modes of production inflammations and other diseases have been divided into idiopathic and sympathetic or primary and secondary. The distinction is useful, because it leads us to investigate causes, to inquire into the mode in which diseases arise. Hence we come to know the true nature of disease, and are enabled to lay down rational rules of treatment. Idiopathic or primary diseases are those produced by some direct agency on the part affected; either by some cause capable of exciting inflammation under all circumstances, or by such influence as will excite disease in persons predisposed. Such are the accidental inflammations. In other and numerous instances of local inflammation or other disease, we see, as I have already explained, no direct operation on the part affected; but we find disturbance m other quarters; we see that the local affection has shown itself subsequently to the existence of such disturbance, and thus, that in point of time it is secondary ; we find often that the cure of such primary disturbance will remove the local affection. Hence we consider the former to be the cause, although we cannot always show how the effect is produced Sympathetic diseases then may be defined as those excited by injury, dissase, or disorder of another part. They are secondary, inasmuch as they come after the original affection. Most organs afford examples of both kinds. Thus gonorrhceal ophthalmia may be caused by direct application of infectious matter to the eye; or it may come

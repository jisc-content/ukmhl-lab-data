278 DISSECTION WOUNDS. The objections to the notion of poison are these: In the great majority of such wounds no effects result at all. Hundreds of dissection cuts and punctures occur without injurious consequences. Where bad effects result, they are uncertain in their nature and degree. In other animal poisons, such as the bites of rabid animals and venomous serpents, in syphilis, glanders, small-pox, and cow-pox, there is a regular course in respect to the time of origin, the nature and succession of symptoms and termination. If, then, there be poison in dissection wounds, it is altogether indefinite and capricious; the source is quite uncertain; we cannot point out any particular state of the parts dissected, or condition of previous disease, that will produce the effect. Again, in dissecting the same body, one suffers, others escape. Indeed the state of health of the individual is probably an important circumstance. These effects, which do not occur in strong and healthy persons, are more common towards the end than at the beginning of the anatomical season. Serious consequences have proceeded, in many instances, from wounds received in examining or sewing up the bodies of patients who had died of peritoneal inflammation, and more particularly of puerperal peritonitis, in which the morbid effusion into the peritoneal cavity may be supposed to have been introduced into the wound, and to have made the noxious impression. Similar effects, however, may be pro- duced by wounds received in the dissection of other bodies, and in any stage of freshness or decay. Perhaps it has hap- pened more often where the body has been fresh. In the only instance in which I have suffered, there was inflam- mation and slight suppuration of the axillary glands, from examining in the middle of the day the body of a patie nt who had died in the morning. So far as I know, there is no ground for fear of receiving

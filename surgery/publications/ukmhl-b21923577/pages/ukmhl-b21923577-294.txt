DISSECTION WOUNDS. 274 trivial hurts in cooks, especially in handling and preparing game or poultry. Local irritation ensues, inflammation is excited, and extends to the neighbouring parts or the entire limb; constitutional disturbance takes place, not unfre- quently so violent as to endanger life, and sometimes, but rarely, to terminate fatally. The local and constitutional mischief, in the great majority of instances, are analogous to what we see as the effect of similar injuries where no suspicion of poison exists; but the degree of disturbance, especially of the latter kind is much more considerable than in simple injuries ; while the nature and progress of the symptoms, and the fatal event, in some few instances, are widely different from what we see in simply mechanical hurts. It must therefore be admitted that there is at least a striking peculiarity in a certain portion of these injuries, a difference of effect, as compared with the results of common wounds, which naturally leads to the inference of a specific cause, and that cause is considered to be an animal poison. Dissection wounds may produce simple inflammation and superficial suppuration; swelling with heat and pain of the limb ; mortification of the wounded part, the last phalanx; or two phalanges ; inflammation of the absorbent vessels and glands, evidenced by red lines extending along the forearm and arm to the axilla; inflammatory swelling, and sometimes suppuration of the gland at the elbow or those of the armpit. There may be simple erysipelas, or the deeper mischief of phlegmonous erysipelas, leading to suppuration in the palm or back of the hand; also thecal abscess, with mortification of the flexor tendons. These several effects are accompanied by such febrile con- stitutional disturbance as would attend similar states of disease arising from ordinary causes.

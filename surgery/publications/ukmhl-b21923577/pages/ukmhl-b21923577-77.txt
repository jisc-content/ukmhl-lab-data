' INFLAMMATION. 57 the fibrine of the blood, namely, that whitish and tough part which is seen after washing the red particles from the crassamentum or clot. It is analogous to the buffy coat seen on the surface of blood drawn from a patient labouring under inflammation, and is now generally termed fibrine. But inflammatory effusions present differences in their character. Thus, contrast the membrane formed about the larynx in croup with the muco-purulent secretion of bron- chitis, or the tough, blood-stained mucus poured forth in pneumonia. Compare the hard, syphilitic node on the tibia with the soft, fluctuating swelling proceeding from the same cause on the forehead. The circumference of an inflammatory swelling presents a soft or (edematous condition which is due to effusion of serous fluid. We see the nature of inflammatory effusions when the , serous membranes are inflamed, because there the substance, which in other parts is deposited interstitially, is effused on . a surface. When the peritoneum or pleura is inflamed, a soft and semi-transparent substance, like thin glue ' is deposited, so that the opposed surfaces, which are naturally free, become agglutinated. On the serous surface of the lung you may see this fibrine poured out in such a quantity as to cover the organ com pletely. At first it lies loosely connected, so that you can easfly scrape it off with the handle of a knife; but soon blood-vessels shoot into it and organize it, when it assumes the character of the structure from which it has been produced that of the pleura. The way in which the vessels extend into the newly deposed substance has been made the subject of microscopical research.

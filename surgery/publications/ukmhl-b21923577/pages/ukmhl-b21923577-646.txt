MELANOSIS. G26 In the interior the colour varied from a deep black to a light yellowish brown. The consistence varied; it was generally softish, so as to break down under the pressure of the finger. When passed over paper, linen, or the skin, a black or brownish colouring matter was left behind; the morbid substance was contained in a kind of cyst, from which it could be turned out. The larger masses presented a slight lobular arrangement on section. The gall-bladder was healthy, and contained bile. Upon the mucous membrane of the jejunum were seen several small black patches; larger patches were found in the fold of the mesentery, and on the peritoneal covering of the pancreas. The pancreas was filled with numerous deep, black deposits of irregular form, some as large as a musket bullet. Smaller deposits were found in the kidneys; two cysts, resembling in size and shape the human testicle, each con- taining a mass of black matter, were attached to the right kidney. The uterus was healthy. The ovaries were greatly enlarged, and converted into irregular, lobulated masses, about eight inches in length which retained no trace of natural structure; each of these masses consisted of a thin but dense cyst, filled with mela- notic structure, of soft consistence, and of the deepest black colour. The ovaries, with the uterus, are preserved in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Some minute black spots were seen upon the mucous membrane of the vagina, near the os tincse. The blood-vessels were healthy. Under the microscope this morbid deposit was found to be composed of irregularly shaped cells, of larger size than in common medullary disease, and containing dark granules, varying in quantity according to the colour of the part.

246 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. often pursue curious courses, being turned out of their original direction by the resistance they experience in striking against parts, and not merely against hard parts; a muscle or the skin will turn aside a bullet coming obliquely, as a ball or stone rebounds from the water. Thus a ball may pass between the skin and the thoracic or abdominal parietes half round the trunk, without penetrating either cavity, and in other cases it may reach a part considerably remote from that at which it had entered. Bullets often remain quietly in the body for years, becoming gradually inclosed in a sort of compact cellular cyst. This is an additional reason for not probing much, nor at all after inflammation has commenced. The danger of gunshot wounds arises principally from the inflammations, suppurations and constitutional disturbance, which are likely to follow the injury : our great object, therefore, will be to prevent these evils, or to lessen their amount. Eest and low diet are obviously necessary. Surprising instances are recorded of recovery from most dangerous wounds where persons have been left for dead on the field of battle, and have remained without assistance for two or more days. Nothing more is required as local application for three or four days than cloths dipped in cold water, or simple poultice either cold or lukewarm. The ancient practice of introducing into the wound foreign substances under the name of tents, or pieces of prepared sponge, in order to provide for the escape of discharge, is now quite obsolete, as well as the application of bandages, except for some specific purpose. The practice of dilating the wound, that is, of making notches in its orifice, to prevent tension and facilitate the escape of discharges, was formerly generally followed, and is perhaps not yet entirely given up. We endeavour to prevent

TREATMENT OP INFLAMMATION. 81 You might at first suppose that local bleeding is the best means of arresting disturbance confined to a particular spot. It seems, prima facie, the method best calculated to deprive the affected part of the material necessary to keep up the excitement. You can, indeed, in this way take blood out of a part, but all the channels of supply remain open, conse- quently fresh quantities continue to come in. The question is, can you cut off the supplies ? This can only be done by general bleeding, which, if carried to a certain extent, will stop the inflammation at the time. You see a patient with pleurisy; there is severe pain in the side, a full and strong pulse, heat of skin, and extreme distress of breathing, so that even speech is most painful. If a vein is opened, the symptoms are relieved as the blood flows, and a copious bleeding takes away the pain and restores the free action of the chest. If a violent inflammation of the eye, with intense redness, pain, and intolerance of light, is treated in the same manner, the vessels are emptied, the organ be- comes pale, and can be freely opened. The effect of this in both cases is most striking when the evacuation is carried to the extent of producing faintness. Thus, general bleeding is capable not only of checking inflammation, but of entirely stopping it for a time. The vessels will fill again and the symptoms recur, but in diminished degree. By thus lessening the force with which the heart is acting, and diminishing the amount of the circulating fluid, the violence of the disorder is effectually checked, and the part is brought more near to the state of health, a condition favorable to the influence of in- ternal remedies, perhaps with the addition of local depletion. In this way general bleeding may sometimes, not fre- quently, be resorted to with advantage when it is important to subdue active inflammation quickly or to check it decidedly. Such occasions are afforded by serious and 6 %

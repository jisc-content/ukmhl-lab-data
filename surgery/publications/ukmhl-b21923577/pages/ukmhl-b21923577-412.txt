392 SYPHILIS". internal, acting on an affection in its nature inflammatory. An ordinary sore is situated on the glans, particularly on the corona, or at the base of the prepuce. Under want of care and probably irregularities of all kinds, it becomes inflamed ; the prepuce inflames, swells, becomes bright red, and cannot be drawn back, while an offensive ichor or bloody and dark- coloured matter flows from its contracted orifice. There is probably a full and strong pulse, with headache, white tongue, and restlessness. When the parts are exposed by slitting the prepuce, a larger or smaller slough of the glans is seen at its back part, of dull gray or brownish colour, the glans itself being swelled, sometimes with pustules on the surface, and the lining of the prepuce is either ulcerated, thickened by inflammation, or in incipient disorganization. The slough extends deeply between the glans and corpora cavernosa, but not so as to open the urethra; when it is de- tached, and granulation has commenced, there is a deep chasm,' at the bottom of which the front ends of the corpora cavernosa are seen. As the slough passes through the blood- vessels of the glans, bleeding often takes place at the time of separation, which, although usually profuse, generally stops of itself by causing fainting; it may, however, require ligature or some styptic. The separation of the slough is followed by healthy granulation, with subsidence of all the local disturbance and speedy recovery. There is no fear of secondary symptoms. In other instances the affection is of sloughing character from the beginning, commencing with a vesicle or pustule, which opens into an angry and painful sore. Sooner or later the part becomes dark, blackish or brownish, with an offen- sive ichorous discharge. There is generally, but not always, surrounding inflammation, with pain, and constitutional dis- turbance. Under appropriate treatment, of which division ot

ITS NATUEE AND SYMPTOMS. 53 parently more numerous. There is an effusion of firm character in and about the immediate seat of inflammation, of a soft substance in the neighbouring parts. These effusions, which fill the interstices and clog the various tissues uniting them together more closely, are the albuminous and fibrinous parts of the blood. The inflamed tissues are firmer to the feel, but the cohesion of their particles is diminished; they have lost their elasticity, and are rendered brittle, so that ligatures cut through them instead of holding. We proceed thus far in our attempts to explain inflammation on safe grounds, that is, on clearly ascertained facts. Not contented with the knowledge thus obtained by direct ob- servation, pathologists have indulged in hypotheses and con- structed theories of inflammation. Besides a host of others two justly celebrated men, Boerhaave and Cullen, have at- tempted the subject, and seem to have believed that they had solved the difficulty. The opinion of the first was con- veyed in the expression error loci; it was that the circulation became obstructed by the minute vessels being stopped up by the particles of the blood. Cullen thought that the minute vessels were in a state of spasm. _ These notions of obstruction and spasm are altogether imaginary, grounded on the diminution or suppression of secretin. This only proves, however, that a new and unusual exertion supersedes the ordinary mode of action Albumen and fibrine are poured out abundantly from the surface of mflamed serous membranes and interstitially in other textures. Inflamed mucous membranes exhale fluid most copiously.

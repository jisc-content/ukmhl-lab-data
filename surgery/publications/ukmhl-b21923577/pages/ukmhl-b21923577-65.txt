INFLAMMATION. 45 Of what are called general affections, there are very few m which there is not inflammation of some particular organ, and in which that inflammation is not either the cause of the affection, or a concomitant circumstance. We shall hardly meet with any cases of fever in which this is not exemplified. Therefore, a course of lectures, whether medical or surgical, must he principally occupied in de- scribing inflammations, in pointing out the effects which they produce in the several organs and textures of the body, in showing the various forms under which they appear, in investigating their causes, explaining their varieties, and exhibiting the means by which they may be controlled, arrested, or removed. I therefore begin with this important subject, in order to avoid the necessity of repetitions in speaking of particular diseases. Inflammation has generally been spoken of and described in the abstract; but the varieties of the process dependent on differences in the structure of the affected organs, on the nature and cause of the disease, are so numerous that they cannot be comprehended in a general description. In order, therefore, to give you a general notion of the subject, I shall select a particular instance, in which the character of the disturbance and its injurious effects are strongly marked in flammation of the hand, produced by a wound, puncture" laceration, or other injury of a finger or the hand The injury, being trivial, is disregarded, and ordinary occupations requiring exertion of the part are continued in spite of pain This however increases, with swelling involving the whole hand, with mtense suffering and fever, until medical assis ance is at last resorted to. The whole hand is now the eai of a violent inflammation in full development Tf i T7 the e„t„, hand. In ft. immediate ^ rf J

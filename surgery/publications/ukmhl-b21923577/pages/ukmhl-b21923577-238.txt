218 MORTIFICATION. rule that amputation should not be performed until the boundary between the dead and living parts has been clearly established. This would seem to imply the converse propo- sition, namely, that when the limit has been unequivocally marked out the operation might be safely resorted to. Both these propositions must be abandoned. If the first rule were followed, lives would be sacrificed when an ope - ration might be undertaken with reasonable chance of success; according to the second, operations would be undertaken in many instances when an unfavorable result would be almost certain. In reference to these remarks, which will be further illustrated in speaking of traumatic and of spontaneous gangrene, it will not escape attention that the cause of one is local, of the other constitu- tional. If in a spontaneous gangrene of the lower extremity the disease should have stopped in the leg, and if the soft parts should have firmly cicatrized, the projecting bones may be sawn through in order to remove the nuisance of the decayed parts, taking care not to injure the cicatrix. Mortification from frostbite, rarely seen in this country, is common in the northern parts of Europe, especially in Russia, and in other equally cold regions. Cold has the same effect locally and generally, enfeebling and at last arresting circulation j the effect is seen in the ex- tremities of the body, for instance, in the hand; fingers become livid, white, cold, and benumbed. The parts are then frozen. By gradually thawing them, circulation is restored. The only danger is in precipitation, in the too free use of warmth and stimuli. The frozen parts are to be rubbed with snow or iced water. By exposure in a very low temperature, the nose, cheeks, and ears are frozen, the persons not being aware of the change until warned by

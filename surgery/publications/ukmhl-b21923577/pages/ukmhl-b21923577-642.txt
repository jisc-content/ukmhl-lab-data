MELANOSIS OF THE EYE. 622 on that side. She experienced no inconvenience, until three months after, when pain came on in paroxysms so severe as to induce her to become out-patient at the Ophthalmic Hospital in Moorfields. She discontinued her attendance after two months, in consequence of her confinement, during which time the paroxysms were less frequent and severe. We found the conjunctival vessels and those of the scle- rotica slightly injected; the cornea transparent; the iris dark-coloured, dull, and motionless ; the pupil widely dilated; the crystalline lens of a dull, dingy hue; both iris and lens were in contact with the cornea. Three small sta- phylomatous projections, one above and two helow the middle of the globe, occupied the outer part of the sclerotica, close to the edge of the cornea; large tortuous vessels, of venous character, ran over the two lower. Vision was totally lost; there was constant pain, which was occasionally very severe. The suspicion of melanosis immediately occurred to my mind. The presence of a morbid growth in the back of the globe would account satisfactorily for the changes of appearance and position in the iris, pupil, and lens, as well as for the partial absorption of the sclerotica. Leeches were applied three times to the left temple, with benefit; but the pain was not entirely removed. As the appearances above described might be accounted for by the formation of fluid within the globe, although I did not think it probable, I punctured one of the staphy- lomatous projections with a grooved needle; no fluid es- caped. Entertaining no further doubt respecting the nature of the complaint, I explained to the patient the necessity of the operation, to which she readily consented. The globe was extirpated on the 23rd of October, 1841, the lids being separated by a free incision at the external commissure, and

LACEKATED AND CONTUSED WOUNDS. 213 to their extent; hence, in contused and lacerated wounds of the most serious description, we expect high inflammation, generally with more or less extensive sloughing of the wounded surface, and corresponding constitutional disturbance. Re- pair must be gradually effected in such cases by granulation. The injured part placed in an easy position, with the sides of the wound gently supported and approximated, may be covered with wet cloths or a soft poultice. Oiled lint some- times answers well as a covering, and does not require frequent change. I had under my care, in St. Bartholomew's, a remarkable instance of lacerated and contused wound, in which the parts had been subjected to extreme violence. A stout coal-heaver twenty-eight years of age, being drunk when drivinghis waggon, fell just before the wheel, which caught in the bend of the knee, carrying the limb before it close on the ground, but not going over it. All the soft structures were divided down to the bone, immediately above the knee, the wound measuring five inches transversely and three inches in depth. It was com- pletely blackened throughout by the mud along which it had been violently carried, which was forced into the severed structures for some distance. Although no injury of the joint was discoverable at the time, the singular nature of the injury and its close proximity to the knee excited some apprehension. After removing small bits of gravel and cleansing as far as was practicable, the wound was covered with a cold poultice, and the knee supported by side splints. A free venesection was necessary on the same evening, and a repetition of the measure in smaller quantity was required on the following clay. Milk diet. The local inflammation did not exceed the amount necessary for the repair of such an injury, and there was no fever. He left the hospital with the wound soundly cicatrised, and in excellent health, in two months.

194 SLOUGHING- PHAGEDENA, denote cases, not of infrequent occurrence, in which, the de- structive process is more rapid, considerable, and unequivocal than in simple ulceration. These affections, varying in their degree of activity and rate of progress, might he divided into acute and chronic; and they form an insensible transition from ulceration to mortification, being closely allied to the former in their milder shape, and hardly distinguishable from the latter in their more violent form. Phagedena is seen most frequently in syphilis, where it occurs both as a primary and secondary affection, and perhaps more in the latter than in the former shape. It may, how- ever, be seen under other circumstances. The edge of a phagedenic sore is sharp, often ragged, with livid fragments apparently crumbling away; the mar- gin often red. The bottom is irregular, livid, grayish or tawuv, sometimes with viscid and bloody discharge. There is considerable pain in the acute, but not in the chronic form. This subject will be further considered under the head ot syphilis If we speak of treatment, without reference to the specific character of the affection, it would include bread poul â–  tice perhaps with charcoal or with lint dipped in a mixture of liquor opii sedativus and water on the sore; opium internally, particularly at night, bark or sarsaparilla, with good diet and stimuli. Sloughing ^etoa-Phagedsena gangrenosa, presents a peculiar disorganization of the affected structures, in which there is more of mortification than ulceration. It is most com- monly seen in women of the town, as an occasional concomi- tant of syphilis, although it is not a direct effect of syphilid poison, andmay occur altogether independently of that disease. I have seen it originate in the hospital. Though generally connected with venereal disease in some shape, it is not neces-

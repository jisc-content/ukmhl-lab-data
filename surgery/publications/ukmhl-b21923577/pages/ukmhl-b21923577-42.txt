22 THE NATUKE AND Most persons imagine that they understand the meaning of health and disease; yet it is not altogether easy to give a satisfactory definition of these two states. Health and disease have been said to be two opposite states, and under many circumstances this representation is correct. For example, a person in full health may be truly represented as in an opposite condition to that of a person in fever. How- ever, health and disease are not simply two states that can be thus" compared; for under each is included a great variety of conditions differing materially from each other. On one side health passes, by an insensible gradation, into disease; and on the other disease in the same way is shaded off if I may use the expression, gradually into health; so that when we survey the conditions which approach to each other, we find considerable difficulty in determining what is health and what is disease. The human body consists of numerous organs, each exe- cuting its own particular function, and all concurring in the general purposes of organization, which are to preserve life,, to keep up the relations which connect the individual with the surrounding world, and to continue the species. When the organization is perfect, and the functions are regularly exe- cuted, the individual is said to be well, or in a state of health: the notion of health, therefore, combines the two circum- stances, perfect structure and perfect functions. The word natural, as applied to the healthy structure, is rather equivo- cal, for we must admit that disease is a part of nature. The French and the Germans use the word normal, to denote what we call the healthy structure. This term (from norma, a square, a rule) is about equivalent to the English epithet healthy; thus the normal, or healthy structure, and the regular execution of functions would be opposed to disease, which implies altered structure or irregular function.

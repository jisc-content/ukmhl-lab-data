8 INTRODUCTION. division, separate the two sides of the body, or the upper and lower halves. This will, at least, be clear and intelligible; but to assert, that surgery and physic are essentially distinct, is to say that there are two kinds of pathology; that the external and internal parts are to be treated on different principles. It would be as rational to say that there are two kinds of physiology, one for the outside, another for the inside of the body. When you know that the component tissues, or organic elements of our frame, are the same throughout, can you suppose that the position of a part in the body can alter the nature and treatment of disease ? It may cause differences in the mode of proceeding, thus you have less power of acting locally on internal parts; it may make the pathological investigation of one organ more difficult or easy than that of another; but it cannot alter essential prin- ciples. Inflammation, for instance, is the same kind of dis- turbance, whether in an internal or external part, and we treat it exactly on the same principles, whether it be in the eye, breast, or testicle; in the heart, lungs, or Uver. The principles of pathology, therefore, are general; they are the same for all parts of the medical art. They result from our knowledge of health and disease generally, and must, there- fore, be common to the physician and surgeon. The eyes have been intrusted to the surgeon as external parts: yet the organ is the most complicated in the body; and many of its component tissues are highly organized, so that its affections are very much diversified, and require a greater insight into pathology and therapeutics than those of any other single part. The eye, with its appendages, not only contains mucous, and fibrous membranes, muscular, glandular and nervous parts, but also several peculiar tissues. It not only exhibits the various affections of these produced by common disease, but it suffers from gout and rheumatism,

SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS. 127 a weakening character, whether in medicine or diet, bearing in mind constantly the necessity of rallying the circulation, rousing and maintaining the energy of the nervous system. In proportion as these objects are secured, we may calculate confidently on improvement in the state of local complaints, and their progress to recovery. Although the patient should be weak, it may be necessary in the first instance to employ active means to correct the secretions and restore the excretions and digestive power. As the several medicines which agree in acting on the alimentary canal, produce their effect in different ways, a combination of them is advantageous when several processes are in fault. Some stimulate the large intestine and lead to the expulsion of its contents, as aloes and colocynth, hence called eccoprotics; some, as calomel and antimony, excite secretions and cause discharge of mucus; others stimulate the intestinal linings, causing watery discharges; rhubarb, without exciting discharge, acts on the the stomach and on the canal generally with so much advantage, as to have become one of the most popular aperients. If the bowels are costive, the tongue coated, the appetite deficient, even not without feelings of nausea, pills of calomel, with colo- cynth or jalap, or of calomel, James's powder and aloes, or calomel alone in a four or five grain dose may be administered, and followed, if necessary, after a few hours, by a warm draught containing infusion of senna, or rhubarb, magnesia, and sul- phate of potash. By unloading the alimentary canal in this way, the system is relieved, and appetite returns at least in some degree. One clearance will probably suffice, though something similar may be again needed. If the bowe&ls continue sluggish, and the motions of bad colour, purgatives should be avoided, especially if there is much weakness such mild aperients being employed as will aid the natural action

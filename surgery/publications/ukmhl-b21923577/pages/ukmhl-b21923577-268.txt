248 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. presumed course of the wound, that an artery likely to afford a troublesome or dangerous bleeding, may have been involved in the mischief. If the dreaded bleeding should occur, it would be desirable to secure the injured vessel; the attempt would be unpromising in a suppurating wound deeply and dangerously situated. Under such circumstances recourse has been had to ligature of the main artery above the wound; this has sometimes succeeded, sometimes failed. Question of amputation.â€”In wounds of the extremities the degree and extent of injury are so great, in some instances, as to preclude all expectation of recovery. The fatal event will be brought about speedily by traumatic gangrene, in a some- what longer time by violent inflammation and fever, or still more remotely by repeated suppurations, gradual exhaustion, and hectic ; to say nothing of the risks of secondary bleeding in both of the latter cases. In other instances the point is doubtful; if we attempt to save the limb, life is en- dangered by the local injury and general disturbance closely following the accident; or the patient, after months or years of suffering and danger, recovers with a limb so damaged in structure and office as to be less useful than an artificial substitute. In army cases the necessity of moving the patient, and the want of accommodation, are to be considered. Amputation, therefore, is unquestionably necessary in some cases, and clearly expedient in many others, in spite of the authority of Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, who, vexed by seeing so many of his soldiers rendered useless by loss of limbs, determined that the practice should be discon- tinued. Bilguer, chief surgeon to the Prussian army, published in 1760, apparently by royal command, a work on the subject, entitled, f Dissertatio de Membrorum Amputatione rarissime administranda, vel quasi abroganda/ the arguments of

DELIRIUM TREMENS. 29/ accident wards become well acquainted with this affection by constant observation, and thus sometimes put us on our guard by noticing its earliest symptoms, when preventive measures can be adopted with the best effect. The treatment of delirium tremens turns on two points, the use of stimuli and that of opiates. The former is the most important in the early stage, when it may possibly supersede the necessity of resorting to the latter. When, however, the want of sleep has come on in the full development of the complaint, opium must be resorted to, and must be used freely, as the nervous system is less ame- nable to its influence than under other circumstances. It is often necessary to increase the dose after smaller quantities to a drachm of laudanum or a grain of morphine. The tartrite of antimony may be advantageously combined with opium ; half a grain of this substance, with a moderate dose of opium, will do more good than double the quantity of the latter medicine alone. I have seen a grain of the tartrite in the same combination calm the nervous system completely when the smaller quantity had failed. It is certainly advisable to avoid the large and repeated doses of opium which have sometimes been necessary in the treatment of this affection. The late Mr. Jones, of Jersey, thought that he had discovered the required sub- stitute in large doses of tincture of digitalis, and has pub- lished several cases in which the plan has been completely successful. He gave half an ounce of the tincture, and repeated the dose, if necessary, in a few hours. It is in- teresting to know that we can give in such large quanti- ties a remedy which we have been accustomed to think it necessary to watch closely when administered in doses of a few drops. Mr. Jones has not given more than two half- ounce doses in any one case, reducing the quantity when he

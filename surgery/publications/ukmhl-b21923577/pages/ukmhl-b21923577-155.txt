FEVER. 135 local mischief; and these effects constitute fever. Here there is no difficulty in seeing the local cause, and in tracing the dependence of the general symptoms on that cause. In other instances the local cause is not so clear; the general symptoms are more prominent, and obscure it. Unless the case be carefully investigated, the primary local disorder may escape notice. All disorders of the brain that may produce febrile disturbance are not characterised by strongly marked local symptoms; and the same remark holds good of disorders in the alimentary canal. There are cases in which we can observe no local affection during life; but examination after death unexpectedly dis- closes local disorder, occasionally serious. Thus, in a case of fever, of which the cause could not be traced during life, Dr. Tweedie found, after death, an abscess in the spleen. Here let me remark that, in speaking of local inflamma- tion as the cause of fever, the word is used in a general sense, to denote not merely the state of a part in which there are swelling, redness, heat and pain, but also the minor degrees of disturbance marked by simple afflux of blood, vascular congestion, or functional derangement. Thus we find that, in the great majority of cases, there is a local cause of fever; if we cannot trace such a cause in some instances, what are we to infer? That such cases are an exception to the general law, or that we do not yet suffi- ciently understand them, and ought to mark them down as subjects for closer investigation; Idiopathic fever, however, belongs to the medical depart- ment of instruction; the causes, nature, and treatment of the cases referred to that head are considered in the writings of physicians and in medical courses. I will only observe that between the febrile diseases treated by the surgeon and those which fall to the lot of the physician there is, in manv

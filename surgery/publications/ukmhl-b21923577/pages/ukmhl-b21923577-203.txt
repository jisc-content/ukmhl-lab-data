ULCERATION. 183 glasses. They cause the redness of granulations. This vascularity is proved by injections and by bleeding on slight injury. Further proof is afforded by the profuse secretion of pus. That granulating surfaces have the power of absorption, is shown by the effect of active substances such as opium, mercury, arsenic, when applied to them. They act in the same way as when taken into the stomach. Absorbents cannot, however, be demonstrated in granulations, and the absorbing power of these growths may depend on their veins, whose thin walls may admit the introduction of foreign matters. Although nervous fibres cannot be shown, the sensibility of granulations is unequivocal; they are often exquisitely painful. The time required for organizing the new material destined to repair the breaches of surface caused by ulceration is short. When the process of destruction has ceased, little red shoots are seen coming through the previously gray and disorganized surface at the end of twenty-four hours, and they then multiply quickly, so as soon to constitute a con- tinuous mass. The mode in which blood-vessels form in the granulations has been made the subject of special inquiry. Small outgrowths arise from pre-existing vessels; they gradually elongate, pursuing an arched course, until, meeting and coalescing with a neighbouring outgrowth, they form a loop, which again gives origin to other loops. Thus veins too are formed; for capillary vessels consist, as the larger vessels, of both arterial and venous txibes. Is repair accomplished in the manner now described in all textures ? It is so in mucous membranes, cellular substance, in the brain, muscles and tendons, and in bones. How is it in the cornea and in articular cartilages ? We cannot fail to remark the striking analogy between this repair and what happens in inflammation and the union

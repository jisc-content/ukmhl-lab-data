62 INFLAMMATION, The terms irritation and disorder, which we use to denote slight deviations from the normal functions of a part, may be considered to comprehend especially in the case of organs not open to immediate observation during life the early stage and the slighter degree of inflammation. When such trivial disorder occurs in an organ winch we can examine, such as the eye, we find its circulation disturbed; the same change probably occurs in internal parts, winch we cannot see. The inflammatory disturbance not unfrequently consists wholly or at least principally in the increased size and number of blood-vessels. It is then called determnaUon of blood, vascular congestion, local plethora, hyperemia. In many cases this change does not remain after death, but often there is turgidity of blood-vessels, with apparent mcrease of number as if they had been injected. Hemorrhage. A rupture of vessels is a likely occurrence when they are distended and under increased exertion Blood may be effused into the substance of a part, such as the brain or lung, or on the surface, as in the alimentary canal or the air-passages, not always proceeding from rupture of vessels, for in the latter cases we may fail to trace breach of surface. Not unfreauently there is some mixture and with the effusions into serous cavxtres, probably from the same sources as the matter or effusions Changes of secretion are illustrated by the effus.cn o serum, lymp^ and pus. These three products are dependen on differences in degree of the inflammatory action, as w See in an abscess, where pus is formed m the centre ymph effused around, to form the parietes, and serum m the ci - cumference. But yet not wholly so, for texture as .veil s degree exerts an influence; thus, serous membranes easily pour forth lymph, and mucous membranes, pus. Diminished cohesion is seen in the brittleness or softened

68 INFLAMMATION, In the second, the appearance of the local symptoms is preceded by previous disorders, often by rigors. The progress is irregular; there are exacerbations and remissions; some- times intermissions. The complaint is protracted, and re- lapses are frequent. Delitescence and metastasis are common. Suppuration and gangrene are comparatively infrequent. Induration is common, and it occurs also in the accidental. Softening is only seen as a consequence of the former. We have also to consider individual peculiarities, such as differences of temperament, constitutional disposition to scrofula, gout, or other diseases, the indefinite matters called idiosyncrasies, and the modifications in constitution depen- dent on age, sex, mode of life, diet, and lastly, the effects produced by climate, season, properties of the air. Thus, hepatitis is common in hot countries. Erysipelas will prevail in foul or imperfectly ventilated wards of an hospital, or other apartments with many occupants. Typhus fever breaks out among masses of people crowded together and badly fed. Typhoid fever with ulceration of the bowels, is ascribed to unwholesome water, bad drainage, and other imperfect do- mestic arrangements. That mysterious disease, the cholera, swept from east to west, brought into activity by some occult atmospheric influence, and seems in many localities to have taken the place of "the plague," a disease allied to typhus in its severest form, now happily nearly extinct. Causes of inflammation.-In considering this part of the subject, it will be convenient to adopt the threefold division of inflammations into accidental, symptomatic, and spon- taneous. Accidental inflammations are those produced by an obvious external cause; such causes being numerous. Injuries of all kinds, mechanical, chemical or mixed.

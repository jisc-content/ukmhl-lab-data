404 SYPHILIS. number of cases that were treated at the Val de Grace, in Paris, a similar result was obtained; that is, out of 1084 cases of primary sores, 336 were treated with mercury; and the average duration of these cases was forty-seven days, without a distinction as to whether they had bubo or not; 698 cases were treated without mercury, and the average duration of these was twenty-eight days. According to these statements, then, the result is much in favour of the treat- ment without mercury. We do not, however, know whether the cases were taken indiscriminately, or selected for the two modes of treatment on account of difference in their nature and indications. The third question is, whether the employment of mercury for the primary affection has any effect in preventing secon- dary disease? Mr. Hunter's statements on this point are contradictory. He probably had not instituted comparative trials himself, so that the opinion he has given on this point is rather theoretical than practical. The returns of numerous cases treated in the British army partly m one way, partly in the other, where the patients continued under observation for a considerable time, so as to afford an oppor- tunity of knowing the result of the treatment of such cases, lead to the conclusion that the employment of mercury for the primary symptoms has a decided effect in preventing the occurrence of secondary affections. This is entirely a ques- tion of experience, only to be solved by observing the results of the two modes of treatment in a great number of cases. Mr. Eose states that, of the cases that he treated without mercury, about one in three had secondary symptoms Similar observations were made at the same time m the York Hospital at Chelsea, in which the proportion of secondary symptoms was one in ten; but in subsequent and more enlarged army experience, the proportion of secondary

78 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION, patient, his age and general condition. Blood may be taken either from the vascular system generally, or from the vessels of a part; thus bleeding is either general or local. In the former case it is drawn from a single vessel of suitable size and by a single opening; that is, either by venesection or phlebotomy, or by arteriotomy ; the latter proceeding, however, having become almost obsolete. In the latter it is taken from small vessels by numerous openings, the methods being cupping, leeches, scarifications, punctures. Cupping is a kind of intermediate method. A skilful cupper will sometimes procure a given quantity of blood by cupping as quickly as it could be drawn from a vein. Small arteries are often divided in cupping on the temple, when they pour forth a powerful jet of blood against the glass. When blood is taken thus by cupping, or when leeches are applied in great numbers, the circulation would be affected nearlv in the same way as by general bleeding. Thus general and local bleeding are sometimes identical in effect. Usually, blood is drawn in larger quantity and shorter time generally than locally; but when local is assimilated to general m quantity and in the time of abstraction, we cannot expect any material difference in the influence on the complaint. The veins at the bend of the elbow are almost invariably selected for venesection in this country. Not believing that the general effect of venesection, or its influence over the inflamed part depends in any material degree on the situation from which the blood is drawn, we choose the arm as the most convenient place for the proceeding, both to the surgeon and patient. . It has been, and probably may still be, a frequen practice on the Continent of Europe to bleed in the internal saphena vein a little above the ankle. I can give no opinion on a subject of which I have no personal experience; yet, it an

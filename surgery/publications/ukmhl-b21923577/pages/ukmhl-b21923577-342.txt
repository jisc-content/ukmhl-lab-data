This might be called acquired scrofula, as distinguished from that of hereditary origin. General exciting causes produce scrofulous forms of disease in those who have the predisposi- tion. When that is strong, disease will appear without any assignable exciting cause.

In comparison with these mea- sures, medical treatment, though by no means unimportant, is of subordinate consequence. Medicines, however, and surgical aid will have a better chance of success when their effect is favoured by attention to the important points alluded to above. The weakly appearance of scrofulous children, and the belief in debility as the cause of the mischief, has often led to the practice of ordering tonic medicines, such as bark and steel, and recommending the free use of animal food, with beer and wine. They who give such advice forget that indi- viduals of naturally weak constitutions cannot do or bear what can be done or borne by those of stronger frame. The active circulation of healthy growing children is quickly dis- ordered by stimulating food and drink; how then can we expect the weaker subjects of scrofula to bear such excite- ment? The strongest and healthiest child would soon be

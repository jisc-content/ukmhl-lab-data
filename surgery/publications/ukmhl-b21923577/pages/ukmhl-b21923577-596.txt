She returned, and submitted to the operation. The tumour, which was injected, proved to be of malignant character, to have ori- ginated under the muscles, and to have passed into their substance in some places. The stump healed favorably, and continued sound; she recovered health and strength, and resumed her domestic occupations. On October 29th, a severe attack of pneumonia took place, from which, although recovery had taken place to a considerable extent, she died on January 12th, 1839, without having become materially emaciated. An examination of the body was not allowed. The pulpy substance is deposited as a distinct growth when an organ is affected, as in the eye or testicle. In the former case the disease soon fills the limited space within the globe, then disorganizes, and breaks through the tunics, confounding all the surrounding textures in one morbid mass. The fibrous and serous tunics of the testicle become distended by the new formation, which still retains its distinct character, although under great enlargement, and thus, on careful examination, we find the light brown soft glandular substance of the organ unaltered in texture, but spread over the medullary deposit, like an additional thin tunic. As a primary affection of bone, I have seen the disease only in the femur, and at its lower articular head, and in the tibia at its upper extremity, in the latter rarely. It has been seen in the upper extremity of the femur and of the humerus, and in the lower end of the tibia. The formation of a cir- cumscribed tumour could hardly be expected in such struc- tures, especially when, as frequently happens, the progress of the mischief is rapid; the medullary substance, therefore, seems to be infiltrated in the bony tissue. Much of the latter

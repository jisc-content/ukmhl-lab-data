AFFECTIONS OF TONGUE AND MOUTH. 425 deep, ulcerated fissure on the right side of the back of the tongue, parallel and near to the mesial line, and so far back that it could not be seen till the organ was drawn forwards. It was an inch long, of uncertain depth, but not less than three quarters of an inch. There was no induration of margin or basis, and it had existed a fortnight. There were small superficial ulcerations of the tonsils. The patient, then in perfect health, had had gonorrhoea a year before, and syphilis five years previously.

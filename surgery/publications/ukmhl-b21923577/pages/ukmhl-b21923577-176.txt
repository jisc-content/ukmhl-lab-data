156 SUPPURATION. progress to the surface is opposed by muscles, tendons, or fascia^ e.g. deep suppuration in the forearm, thigh, or leg, more especially in the palm and sole. It is a general law that matter advances towards the exterior; but when it encounters unyielding parts, such as fibrous textures, its advance is opposed and retarded; hence it extends in other directions, between muscles, in tbe course of tendons, under fasciae, making the mischief more extensive. In the palm and sole there is not only dense fascia, but the integuments are thick, and the subcutaneous tissue very compact. Thus matter cannot find its way outwards, but extends among the tendons and nerves, and, in the upper ex- tremity passing under the annular ligament, finds an easy pas- sage into the forearm. In all these cases open as early as possible. You must often puncture when you cannot feel fluctuation, guided by the local symptoms to the situation of the matter. The same reasoning applies still more strongly to the case of matter formed on the surface of bone, as in necrosis. If not speedily discharged, it may be expected to detach the perios- teum more and more extensively. 2. When suppuration has occurred in parts abounding with cellular and adipous substance, where, consequently, the col- lection extends readily in the circumference, for example, in the neighbourhood of the anus and in the perinseum. Here too the opening should be ample, and the edges should be kept apart by the interposition of dressing, to prevent the formation of fistula. This; rule is particularly applicable where copious cellular membrane is covered externally by muscles or fasciaa, which will impede the advance of the pus to the surface, as in sup- purations in the neighbourhood of the male urethra, whether

AFFECTIONS OF THE SKIN. 415 greater part of the body, is preceded by feverish disturbance, often very considerable, which declines in proportion as the affection of the skin is developed. 5. Pustular {Ecthyma syphiliticum), consists of pustules, varying in size, formed on inflamed and indurated bases. They are generally separate, scattered irregularly On the trunk and limbs, and not numerous. Sometimes there are groups of small pustules on inflamed patches of skin, as in the case of impetigo. Sometimes they approach in size to the papulae, and thus form a transition from the papular to the pustular form ■ some of these, indeed, are often inter- mixed in the papular eruption. Occasionally the pustules are of considerable size. The cuticle soon gives way, and thin, yellowish, or brownish scabs form, which soon fall off, leaving a reddish mark. 6. Vesicular; Rupia. On an inflamed elevation of the skin the cuticle is raised, not by pus, but by a thin, slightly opaque fluid, which escapes and forms a thin, dark, adherent crust. Under this ulceration takes place, and extending equally in all points of the circumference, forms a circular sore. When it has attained some size, about that of a shilling, the ulcer begins to heal at some one part, while it spreads in other directions. The healing may begin in the centre, while ulceration goes on in the whole circumference, so that the sore retains the circular form, and is annular • or it may heal at one part of the edge, and from that towards the centre, and spread at the rest, so as to have a crescent shape. The spreading edges of these sores are phagedenic, and retain that character so long as they increase in extent. The surrounding skin is bright red, the edge ragged and sharp, while the surface immediately within this edge is a grayish or yellowish disorganized substance, in short, a kind of slough, Which, though of softish appearance, is not deficient in

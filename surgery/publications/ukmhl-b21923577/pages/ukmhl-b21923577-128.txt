108 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. the complaint may have obviously originated in and is main- tained by fulness of habit; in affections of important parts, such as the head or retina; or -where disease is extensive, as in inflammation and ulceration of a limb. It is a matter of consequence to regulate the digestive organs. You would first clear out the alimentary canal by suitable aperients, and then use such means as will keep it in good order without purging. We want to have the fecal residue of the food expelled without watery evacuations. Aloetic medicines, colocynth, and rhubarb, answer. If the colour of the evacuations is unhealthy, mercurial preparations, which excite the secretions of the digestive apparatus, may be usefully combined with the purgative; they certainly impart a healthier colour to the motions. Extract of colo- cynth ; aloes; extract of rhubarb, with calomel or blue pill, are suitable combinations.

Aloes comp. The administration of mercury is advantageous, though the effect is slower than in acute inflammation. It often exerts a marked influence in arresting the mischief and in removing interstitial deposition. It acts as powerfully in chronic as in acute iritis. As the clanger of disorganization is not so imminent, we administer it in the mildest form and in mode- rate doses. Three or four grains of grey powder or blue pill, once or twice in the twenty-four hours, will answer the purpose. That mercury in small doses, continued for a more or less considerable time, is of use in such cases, has been established as the result of general experience. These doses and this mode have been called alterative, in the belief that they change or alter the state of parts by a gradual agency, without any violent action. It may sometimes be advan-

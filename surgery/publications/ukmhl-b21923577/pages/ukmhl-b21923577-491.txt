SYPHILIS. 471 to be injected under the foreskin. Aperient medicine. To keep in bed. In the evening, the leeches having drawn much blood with considerable relief, the pain was lessened, the discharge less red and offensive, and thicker. The bowels had been freely opened; the pulse full and rather hard. I took away sixteen ounces of blood from the arm, and ordered a saline draught, with thirty drops of Tinctura Opii, if there should be such pain as to prevent rest. 8th.—The blood presented a thin, buffy coat; he passed a good night without the opiate. The discharge is no longer fetid; the prepuce is still inflamed and swollen ; the glans and penis are very tender to the touch, and occasionally painful. Twelve leeches, which occasioned free bleeding; an opiate draught at night. 9th.—The penis less swelled and painful; the discharge no longer sanious nor fetid, but a thin, pus. An opening draught, and afterwards a saline draught every six hours; an opiate at night. 10th.—Occasional severe pain during the night, with in- tervals of ease; the penis still red, and very tender to the touch. I slit open the prepuce, of which the internal surface was inflamed and partially ulcerated; the sore of the penis was larger, presenting an excavation that would hold a filbert; a loose, black slough lay in it; the discharge puriform, not discoloured, but very fetid. Frequent tepid ablution; poultice of bread and water. 11th.—Much easier since the division of the prepuce; the lining of the latter and the glans present several ulcerations, with ash-coloured surface.

In the same way a syphilitic sore behind the corona glandis not unfre- quently causes inflammation, excoriation, and fetid, puriform

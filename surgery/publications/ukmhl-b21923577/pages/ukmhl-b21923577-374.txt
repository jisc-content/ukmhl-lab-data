35-1 SYPHILISâ€”ITS NATURE, attack part after part, and that its ravages could be arrested only by the use of mercury, which was regarded as an in- fallible specific. Such was the general notion when Mr. Abernethy published his 'Observations on Diseases resembling the Venereal.' He asked the opinions of the most eminent surgeons then living in London, among whom were the late Messrs Cline and J. Pearson, two gentlemen in whose expe- rience and judgment the greatest confidence was placed. These and other surgeons consulted on the occasion, were unanimous in the opinion above mentioned. Hence it followed that a disease which had got well without the use of mercury could not have been syphilitic: this was the belief of Astruc; it was also the doctrine of J. Hunter, who has founded much of his reasoning on this supposition; and it was adopted from the latter by Mr. Abernethy, whose representations m the publication just mentioned are entirely founded on this view, which, indeed, he assumes as the basis of his arguments. Hence arose the distinction made by Mr. Hunter, in the case of diseases resulting from the common source of sexual intercourse between syphilis and diseases resembling it, but which are not syphilitic. It has been discovered, of late years, that these notions are entirely unfounded; that syphilis does not necessarily possess this destructive character, either in its separate symptoms or collectively; and finally that in every shape, whether primary or secondary, it may get well without the employment of mercury. Indeed, so complete has been the revolution ot opinion on this subject, that some surgeons, including persons of experience and judgment, have entirely discarded the use of mercury in these affections, regarding it as not only un- necessary but prejudicial. The extensive prevalence of these erroneous notions, and the firm faith with which they were held, are calculated to

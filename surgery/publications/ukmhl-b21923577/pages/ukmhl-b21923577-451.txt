SECONDARY SYPHILIS. 431 their source, and that these symptoms are developed in a regular succession, so as to admit of establishing four kinds of syphilis, so different from each other as to lead to the in- ference that they owe their origin to distinct poisons. Al- though he is far from having succeeded in this attempt, he has pointed out certain combinations and successions of morbid appearances which are not unfrequently met with in practice, and has distinguished them by appropriate names. He has acted judiciously in taking his names from the erup- tions which are the most constant and characteristic symp- toms. Looking to the indurated sore or chancre described by Mr. Hunter, he assumes that as the type of syphilis, and finds it commonly followed by the copper-coloured, scaly eruption, by the excavated and tawny ulcer of the tonsils, by pains in the shafts of the long bones, and nodes formed on their surface. He calls this the scaly venereal disease, which especially requires the use of mercury, both in its primary and secondary form. The second form is named, from its eruption, papular venereal disease; the eruption, which is papular, is accompanied by inflammation of the mucous mem- brane of the throat, with superficial ulceration, by severe pain in the joints and limbs, without swelling of the periosteum or bones, and by pains in the chest and back. The primary affections are gonorrhoea, excoriation of the glans and pre- puce, and superficial ulceration, unattended with indurated base or elevated edge. There is active inflammation of the skin, with constitutional disturbance of corresponding cha- racter. Ordinary antiphlogistic means are proper in the outset, mercury being reserved for the decline of the com- plaint. A third, well-marked form of the disease is the phagedenic, the primary affection being a phagedenic sore, which is fol- lowed by phagedenic sore throat, rupial eruptions, troublesome

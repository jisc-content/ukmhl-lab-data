359 USE OF MEECURY. kept on through the night, the system will gradually he affected. The same effect may be produced by smearing the ointment on the armpit, and leaving it there during the night. A principal advantage attending this mode of employing mercury is, that it does not produce those unfavorable effects on the alimentary canal, and other parts of the system, which the internal use of mercury frequently does, or it produces them in a much less degree. Hence it used to be the general mode of administering the remedy for the purpose of affecting the system. The troublesome nature of the process has pro- bably led to its general discontinuance, though it is still resorted to occasionally with advantage. Mercury may be introduced into the system by general fumigation of the surface. If the naked body be placed in a box, at the top of which there is an opening made for the head to pass out; and if some preparation of mercury be vola- tilized by means of a hot iron placed on a grate in an opening at the bottom of the box, the whole surface being exposed to such fumigation, a very speedy affection of the system may be produced. For this purpose the gray oxide, or cinnabar, may be employed. The cinnabar, however, is too active to be used in this way. Indeed, the mere local use of it in the way of fumigation, sometimes affects the system. Cinnabar fumi- gation has been used in some ulcerations of the throat, and I have sometimes seen salivation produced on such occasions. The mildest and safest form of mercury for internal use is the Hydrargyrum cum creta, in which the metal is brought into the state of oxide by trituration with chalk : this is fami- liarly known as a domestic remedy under the name of gray powder. It possesses, at the same time, sufficient power as an antisyphilitic for the great majority of cases. In the dose of three or four grains three times daily it will soon affect the

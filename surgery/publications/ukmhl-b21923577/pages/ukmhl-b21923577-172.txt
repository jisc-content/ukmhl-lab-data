152 SUPPURATION. lined by a smooth pyogenic membrane, and the natural opening, constitute a fistula or sinus. The former term merely means a tube or pipe. The opening sometimes closes for a time, and the discharge is renewed after a longer or shorter interval. Treatment.â€”The local treatment of a simple phlegmonous abscess, when suppuration has occurred or is imminent, is of the simplest character. The. part, kept at rest, should be covered with a soft poultice, that of linseed being generally found the most comfortable, or by water dressing. Warm fomentation from time to time often affords temporary relief. The disease thus pursues its course, with little inconveni- ence, to its natural termination by discharge of the matter through a spontaneous opening, the poultice being continued for a short time, and then replaced by a light dressing. Sometimes, in an extensive and violent inflammation, such as that of the hand and forearm, from injury of a finger, there may be suppuration at one part requiring relief, while dan- gerous inflammation is spreading in another. The means calculated to lessen the amount and extent of the general inflammatory disturbance may be continued after attending to the partial suppuration. Since the cyst of an abscess absorbs as well as secretes, you might conclude that if inflammation could be completely subdued, the matter might be taken up by the absorbents, and thus that the abscess might be cured without the dis- charge of its contents externally. This sometimes happens, but so rarely, that in practice we consider an external dis- charge, by puncture or bursting, a necessary consequence of suppuration. The cases in which I have most frequently seen dispersion of matter by absorption have been suppurations of the in- guinal glands from primary venereal sores, and those of the

The ulceration is super- ficial, with a clean, smooth surface, affording a thin discharge in small quantity, which concretes into a slight, closely adhering scab. The margin of the sore is a little raised; there is a bubo in the right groin, while the sore is on the left side of the prepuce. This occurrence of glandular affection on the side opposite to the ulcer is occasionally noticed. This case is treated in the same manner as the two preceding. Thus these four cases of disease arising from promiscuous sexual intercourse, present to your observation four primary affections essentially distinct; and I know no reason why one of these should be called true syphilis more than the others. Hence syphilis, whatever may be the nature of its unknown cause, and whether that cause be one or many, produces phenomena considerably varied. They who have been endea- vouring to find out true venereal disease, in the expectation of finding, as in smallpox or cowpox, an affection of deter- minate character, commencing at a regular period, running a certain course, lasting a certain time, and coming to a definite conclusion, have been seeking for what does not exist. The whole phenomena of syphilis, the characters of the primary disease, the constitutional effects, the duration of both, the intervals between the primary and secondary affections, and between the successive manifestations of the latter, present numerous and striking differences.

619 TREATMENT. be taken without delay. Dr. Norris, however, relates an exceptional case, the only one that I know of, in which a melanotic disease was removed by himself with permanent success. It occurred in a young woman of twenty-six, of fair and freckled complexion, thin and delicate form. Three years previously, a mole situated between the shoulders had been wounded by the blade of a pair of scissors for the purpose of removing it. A dark brown stain subsequently surrounded the mole, which had begun to increase twelve weeks before Dr. Norris saw it, when he characterised it as the most perfect specimen of melanotic tumour he had ever seen. It was as large as a moderately sized mushroom, oval and flat, soft and elastic, and attached by a thick pedicle. There was a small tumour the size and colour of a black grape at its upper surface. The part was removed with abundance of the surrounding substance. When Dr. Norris published this with other cases in 1857, the patient had continued well for eight years. The origin of the mischief from the accidental injury of a mole and the neglect of early measures were seen in a Cornish gentleman, fifty-three years of age, who had on the left fore- arm a small mole with long hairs growing on it, which he had hurt by friction with a flesh-brush a year and a half before I saw him. A person to whom he showed it said it was a bleeding wart and tied a silk thread round it. A small swelling came in the skin after the mole had dropped off, and there were warty appearances around it. This was freely removed by a surgeon, as well as a small swelling which formed in the scar of that operation. When I saw him there was a cicatrix about two inches long over the radius, and about its middle a firm swelling as large as a nut, a similar swelling over the ulna, another just above the internal condyle, with another as large as a pigeon's e

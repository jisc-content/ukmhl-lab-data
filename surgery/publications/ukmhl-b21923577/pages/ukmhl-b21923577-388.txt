368 ACTION OF MERCURY. farinaceous articles are suitable. As the bowels may be dis- turbed by the remedy, acids should be avoided, such as salads, pickles, vinegar, unripe fruits, and uncooked vegetables generally. As it may be necessary to administer mercury to those in reduced health, a more generous and nutritious diet, with stimuli, may be required to sustain the powers of the constitution. It produces a peculiar effect on the mouth. In the first place it causes an unpleasant metallic or coppery taste, which patients are most sensible of in the morning, communicating at the same time a fcetor to the breath, so that persons who have taken mercury, and do not wish that the fact should be known, must be careful not to approach too near to those from whom they wish to conceal it. It then produces a swollen, spongy, inflamed state of the gums, with loose- ness, and a tender condition of the teeth, so that the person is neither able to bite or masticate a hard substance, nor anything that approaches to a state of solidity. The sur- face of the tongue, and the mucous membrane of the lips and cheeks, undergo the same kind of inflammatory affection as the gums. The parts swell, and become very painful, and if the effect of the remedy goes on, it causes ulceration, the surface thus exposed assuming a kind of grayish or ash colour, as if it were covered with a superficial slough. In the further progress of the mercurial influence, sloughs to some depth may take place. In conjunction with these effects on the mouth, there is an increased secretion of the salivary glands, and this constitutes salivation, or ptyalism, during which a person will spit a pint, or more, in twenty-four hours This fluid is turbid, ropy, and sometimes tinged or mixed with blood The effect thus produced on the mouth, of which the degree now described is excessive and injurious, is con- sidered as a criterion of that general influence of the remedy

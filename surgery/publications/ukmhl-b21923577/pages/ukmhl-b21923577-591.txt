HAND. 0/1 greatly improved in all respects since the recovery from his painful and dangerous disease. The cicatrix is smooth, of good colour, and passes insensibly into the natural integument, which is perfectly healthy over the whole hand. It occupies about one half of the palm, and the entire ulnar edge of the hand from the wrist to the first phalanx of the two last fingers, and is continued towards the back over the metacarpal region of the little finger. It sticks inseparably to the me- tacarpal bone of that finger, and has thus confined it and the ring finger in a bent position, with little inconvenience, as it is in the left hand: the middle and last joints of both these fingers are unaffected.

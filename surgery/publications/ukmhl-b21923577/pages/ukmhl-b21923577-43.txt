DIVISIONS OP DISEASES. 23 Disease has been defined an improper or irregular execution of one or more functions of the body. This, however, is objectionable, as omitting what is of primary importance in the consideration of disease, namely, the state of the organs. The definition, however, is correct as far as it goes; for wherever we see an irregular execution of any function, we may safely conclude that disease exists; but we may have disease, and that of unequivocal kind, existing in the body without any observable deviation from the natural state of the functions. Warts and corns are considered to be diseases, and at all events, steatomatous tumours are so; yet these may arise, and even acquire considerable size, without the individual being aware of their existence; and, even when they have arrived at considerable magnitude, they do not necessarily disturb any function, being only inconvenient by their bulk. Even so formidable a disease as cancer affecting the female breast may begin and go on so insensibly as to attain some size before the female is aware that any change has occurred; and the presence of the disease is discovered accidentally. Disease may be called a deviation from the normal, regular, j-r healthy state of any organ or function, or of the fluids se- creted by any part. This may be exemplified in the stomach, [t may be affected with inflammation and cancer; and in both cases there is a manifest change in structure; in the former ;emporary, in the latter permanent. In indigestion (dys- pepsia), nausea, sickness, the function of the stomach is mpaired, and the organ fails in its office. In heart-burn md water-brash an acid secretion is poured into the cavity, vhile in yellow fever a strange, dark, more or less fluid sub- stance, resembling coffee grounds, and called black vomit, is hrown up. You will perhaps be inclined to think that the three cir-

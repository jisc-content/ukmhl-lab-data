The powerful influence which anaesthetics, chloroform par- ticularly, are capable of exerting on the nervous and mus- cular systems, has naturally led to their being tried in tetanus. Some temporary ease, but no permanent benefit, has been experienced from them, while they seem to have been rather injurious on other occasions.

The charge went through the sole from behind forwards, coming out in a mass between the great toe and the second, without breaking any bone or injuring the exter- nal parts, except at the entrance and exit of the charge. Nothing unfavorable had occurred in the foot, which had

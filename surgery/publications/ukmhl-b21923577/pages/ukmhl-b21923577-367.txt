MODE OF PRODUCTION. 317 to this argument drawn from the silence of preceding writers, let us remember that it has been doubted whether the con- tagious eruptive fevers were known to the Greek and Roman physicians. The Arabians pointed out their existence clearly, but their distinctive characters, though apparently obvious to common observation, were for a long time neither perceived nor acknowledged. Smallpox, measles, and scarlet fever were considered as mere varieties of the same disease, till near the beginning of the eighteenth century; and the diagnosis of measles and scarlet fever was not established till 1793, in the second edition of Dr. Withering's essay on the latter. The smallpox was known for centuries before its contagious nature was recognised, and even Sydenham ascribed it to the state of the atmosphere, with only a vague and doubtful reference to contagion. These considerations show us that the truth may escape the notice even of enlightened observers, and lead to the conclusion that the diseases of mankind, like their moral and physical constitution, are likely to remain unchanged. Against hastily concluding that diseases not previously described have therefore not existed, we may derive a salutary caution from the cases of gonorrhoeal ophthalmia, and syphi- litic iritis. We cannot doubt that both of these very striking affections now so commonly met with, must have been fre- quently seen at all times, though they have entirely escaped the notice of Mr. Hunter, and of the other writers on syphilis, until within a few years. In our ordinary experience, syphilis appears as the effect of a poison directly communicated from an infected to a healthy person. The infection cannot be conveyed, as was supposed heretofore, by kissing, embracing, use of the same cups, or other utensils. In the great majority of instances a morbific secretion, that of a primary ulcer or chancre, applied to the sound surface of a healthy person, produces the pri-

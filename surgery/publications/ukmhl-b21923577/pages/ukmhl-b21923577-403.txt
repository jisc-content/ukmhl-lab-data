They are still less common on mucous surfaces, yet the urethra and vagina are not exempt; we see them occasionally at the entrance of both canals. Primary sores are produced by the application of infectious matter to a natural unbroken surface, or to a wound or sore. The poison acts more rapidly in the two instances last men- tioned.

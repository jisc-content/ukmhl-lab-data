122 SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS. exercise, but a person in good health, like a horse in good condition, should be able to use considerable exertion with- out much sweating. In constitutional unhealthiness the skin is pale and dingy, harsh and dry; the countenance is sallow. The blood is not effectively pushed into the capillaries of the surface, and the important excretion, by which much useless and noxious matter is got rid of, is diminished or sus- pended. By a strange inconsistency, persons who incur con- siderable trouble and expense in insuring daily attention to the skin of their horses, very often take little or no care of their own. The state of an organ so important cannot be of less consequence in the one case than in the other. Consider- ing that the condition of this organ is powerfully influenced by that of the circulation and other internal movements, while this action is reciprocal, medical men cannot fail to understand that daily care of this organ secures health and strength to those who are well; while its return, when un- healthy, to an efficient state of circulation and secretion affords important aid to the recovery and maintenance of health. With this condition of the skin there is usually combined, in greater or less degree, decline of flesh and power. The muscles want the firmness and ready contractibty of health, becoming even loose and flabby, with increasing unfitness for bodily exertion. As the mischief proceeds the nervous system becomes more and more depressed. There is lowness of spirits, irritability of temper, deficient energy of will and action. Hypochondriasis and melancholy may supervene. Nervous irritability shows itself in numerous and various forms, especially in females. The circulation, as might be expected, varies according to the general condition; the pnlse being rather full aud strong at one end of the scale, small and feeble at the other. It is sometimes irregular.

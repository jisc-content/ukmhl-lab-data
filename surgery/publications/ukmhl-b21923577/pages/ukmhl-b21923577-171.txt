151 SUPPURATION. very thin, the redness being of a deep and sometimes livid tint. The thinned skin ulcerates, and matter escapes; there is resistance and consequent separation of the cuticle, some- times to a considerable extent, where it is thick, as in the hand and foot. At first a small quantity only escapes, for the opening is in general a small one; but as much pus is discharged as suffices to remove tension, and the patient is consider- ably relieved. The sides of the abscess contract in conse- quence of this diminution of the quantity of its contents; pus still flows out; the opening becomes larger, and ultimately allows the whole to drain away. By means of this process, the cavity of the sac becomes much lessened ; ultimately it granulates, the surrounding swelling subsides, and the open- ing cicatrises. The skin, being distended and deprived of its vascular supply, sometimes sloughs; and the matter escapes as the slough separates. The openings thus made by nature are generally small, and allow partial escape of the matter, with diminution of tension and relief. Sometimes the aperture is larger, and the entire contents are evacuated at once; the cavity con- tracts in proportion to the diminution of its contents; pus is still secreted, and drains out slowly. The sides of the abscess, reduced in extent by gradual contraction, ultimately collapse and coalesce, completely effacing the excavation; and the aperture is closed by granulation and cicatrisation. Sometimes, especially in parts which move considerably in executing their functions, the cavity of the abscess does not completely close. It is reduced in size; but an opening remains from which matter is discharged; this leads into a small tube, of various extent in different instances, sometimes branching out. This small tube, the remains of the abscess,

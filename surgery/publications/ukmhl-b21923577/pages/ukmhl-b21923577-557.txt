OPEHATION. 537 contrast to what I once saw on a different occasion. It was that of a stout lady, with large bosom, in whom one breast was a uniform mass throughout of scirrhus, with adherent, but not discoloured skin. Near its centre there was a sound cicatrix, about an inch and a half in diameter. I found that this was the result of an application made by a person who had undertaken to cure the cancer. A large hole had been made by caustic in the mass, from which a thin and copious discharge had issued for a considerable time ; this gradually diminished, and the part healed. I could adduce other instances in which life has been prolonged for various periods, from four to ten years or more, by the removal of scirrhous mammary glands, but those now related are sufficient for the purpose. The most favorable time for the operation is when the disease is in the indolent period, though frequently we do not see it till that time is past. If the breast has become fixed to the chest, if the skin covering and surrounding the gland is thickened and hardened, and if cutaneous tubercles are formed in the neighbourhood, the operation cannot be recom- mended. Disease of the axillary glands, which can be removed, and the commencement of ulceration, are not con- clusive against operating, if the breast is loose upon the chest, and all diseased parts can be effectually taken away. To refuse operation is to pass sentence of death on the patient, and that of the most painful, distressing, and often lingering kind; few minds are strong enough to bear this. To delay and temporise, wasting time in treatment which is sure to be fruitless, keeps up a state of uncertainty and anxiety, with indefinite and exaggerated apprehensions of evil, which depresses the spirits, adding unnecessarily to the difficulties of the case, and often leading the sufferer to take refuge in quackery. I consider it a strong reason for

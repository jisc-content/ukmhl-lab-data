In order to abridge as much as possible the amount of inconvenience and confinement occa- sionally incidental to a suppurated bubo, it has been recom- mended to make an early opening with a very narrow knife, and to press out the matter gently, to close the opening with a small bit of plaster, and cover the part with water dressing, the patient remaining at rest for a day or more. A small suppuration occurring in an indolent bubo, which does not interfere with the occupations of the patient, may be left to break of itself, and will require nothing more than a bit of plaster over the opening until it closes. In a large, glandular swelling, there may be repeated suppurations, resulting in fistulous openings, which may require to be injected with astringent solutions, or to be laid open with subsequent pressure by bandage. Large, indolent buboes, with or without sinuses and fistulous openings, may be treated with blisters, which sometimes lead to their dispersion, sometimes to more active inflammation and suppuration; they may also be painted over with a solution of nitrate of silver, in the proportion of a scruple to a dram of water. This solution may be used with advantage in other states of buboes, and is often successful in preventing the occurrence of suppuration. Unhealthy and extensive ulceration, which not uncom- monly supervenes in scrofulous subjects, with foul surface, livid, raised, and irregular margin, is best remedied by pure air, especially that of the sea side, with good diet, include stimuli, sarsaparilla, and tonics. Sloughing bubo impera- tively requires removal from a noxious to a pure atmosphere the general treatment just mentioned, and such local means' as charcoal or yeast poultices, and balsam of Peru - if the strong nitric acid should be thought advisable, it must be used most cautiously in the neighbourhood of the great vessels

HOSPITAL GANGKENE. 199 discharge takes its place. A thin white stratum spreads over the -wound, it becomes thicker and grayish, streaked with blood. It may look yellow, like pus; but you cannot wipe it off. It is a soft, pulpy, or glutinous mass, adherent to the parts below, and resulting from disorganization of the surface and contiguous textures. The edges of the wound and the adjacent skin may slough in successive portions, and sometimes the whole surface of the wound sloughs, with offensive discharge. The ulcer extends rapidly, with great pain, which prevents rest, destroying both in circumference and depth. The patient is pale and weak, with feeble pulse, and loss of appetite. That this dangerous affection is pro- duced by the influence of a noxious atmosphere, and that the number of sufferers, and the succession in which the cases occur in particular instances, depend on their exposure to a common cause, seems to be generally admitted. Whether the disease, when it has thus arisen, possesses contagious pro- perties is more doubtful, though it has been spoken of under the name of contagious ulcer. Its progress is most effectively arrested by separation and dispersion of the patients, with thorough cleansing and ventilation of the apartments they have occupied. The complaint has been hardly known in England, owing perhaps to the precaution of limiting the num- ber of patients in reference to the cubical measurement of wards, and of enforcing sufficient ventilation. It has been more frequently seen in France, especially in the South as in Lyons and Montpelier, and in Spain. It was un- known for a long time in St. Bartholomew's, where, however a few cases have occurred at considerable intervals in the last ten or twelve years. The treatment is essentially the same as that of sloughing phagedsena, namely, destruction of the morbid surface by means of nitric acid or other escharotic of equivalent power,

SWELLED TESTICLE. 493 Thus a considerable inflammatory tumour, apparently in- volving the entire testicle, is presented to our view in the scrotum. This swelling, which is at first painful, and per- haps considerably so, is worse when the patient is in the upright posture and using active exertion, while it may be easy in the recumbent position, more especially if sup- ported by a suspensory bandage. When carefully examined, the swelling is found to be hard and painful behind, soft and free from pain in front. The painful part, about two thirds of the whole, is an inflamed and enlarged, epididymis, while the front and painless portion is the body of the testis, un- affected, and generally surrounded by some serous effusion, probably poured out by the serous covering of the inflamed epididymis. The scrotum is unaffected unless the inflam- mation should be unusually severe, when the integument may be reddened, and even the cellular tissue thickened, so as to render the skin partially adherent to the swelling. The treatment comprises confinement to the horizontal posture and light diet, the application of leeches, from four to eight or ten, to the inflamed epididymis, followed by fomentation and poultice, and the mild use of mercury, three or four grains of gray powder or blue pill three times daily. The mercurial part of the plan is advantageous by removing the enlargement of the epididymis speedily and effectually, and preventing that partial swelling and induration of the texture which often remain behind after careless treatment not without fear that the tube may become closed in that situation, and the testicle be thus rendered useless. Another treatment, of comparatively recent date, is that of compression by means of adhesive plasters, so applied as to cover the whole swelling completely and as firmly as they can be put on. The inflamed organ is insulated and made to project by drawing the sound testicle out of the way â–  it is

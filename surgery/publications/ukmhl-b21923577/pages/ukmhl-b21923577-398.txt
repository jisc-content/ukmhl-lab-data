It has heen much the habit in modern times to be con- tented with producing a merely sensible impression on the mouth, and then to discontinue the mercury, under the notion that when the mouth is affected at all the influence on the system is sufficient for the cure of the disease. I cannot coincide with this view of the subject. There are many instances in which this slight effect on the mouth is sufficient, while in others the symptoms do not yield till the remedy is carried further. We never see the symptoms give way so quickly and favorably as when the mercury, without our having wished it, has produced salivation. I cannot, there- fore, adopt the opinion of those who regard ptyalism as an occurrence interfering with the curative influence of the remedy. It is, indeed, a painful state, and not necessary to the accomplishment of our object. We should therefore proceed cautiously in the few instances in which we find it expedient to push the use of mercury further than usual, as salivation sometimes comes on quite unexpectedly. In most instances a mild effect suffices, and we manage our doses of the remedy so as to keep this up without increas- ing the amount of action. Since mercury, imprudently and carelessly used, is capable of producing injurious temporary effects, and since its long- continued and repeated employment may injure health seriously and permanently, it is desirable to attain its cor- rective or specific influence on venereal disorders with as small a quantity of the remedy as is consistent with the object. We must therefore consider two questions, what degree of mercurial influence is necessary to arrest and cure syphilis, and how long the remedy ought to be continued. In reference to the first point, is a slight action on the

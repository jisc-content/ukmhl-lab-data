242 LACERATED AND 'CONTUSED WOUNDS. secondary bleeding should come on in spite of these pre- cautions, which is quite improbable, open the wound, clear out coagula, tie any bleeding vessel. Most probably, how- ever, clearance and exposure will have stopped the bleeding. The wound should then be left moderately open, with light covering. When the sides of an incised wound have not been brought to-etherin the first instance, when such a wound has been attended with loss of substance, so that union could not be effected, or, when the attempt to procure adhesion has failed, then the healing must be accomplished by granulation and cicatrization, that is by the so-called second intention. The successive changes which the wound then undergoes are, cleansing of the surface with flow of serum, discharge of Pus, granulation, cicatrization. The process is correctly described by the older writers under the quaint terms of mundification, digestion, incarnation and cicatrization. Rest, with mild applications, is necessary during the inflammation which accompanies these changes; the subsequent treat- ment is the same as that of granulating ulcers. Lacerated and contused «,oi«Mfo.—Lacerated wounds being effected by tearing instead of cutting, are attended with greater injury to the parts. They are, however, frequently healed by adhesion, and should be treated on that view in the same way as incised wounds. Even the degree of violence in- volved in a wound of the scalp inflicted by a stick or a poker, does not always prevent union by the first intention. When great bruising accompanies laceration, as in wound of a limb by a wheel passing over it, or in great wounds by machinery, the damage to the surfaces precludes all hope ot recovery by adhesion. The inflammation following injuries is in proportion to the degree of violence with which they have been inflicted, and

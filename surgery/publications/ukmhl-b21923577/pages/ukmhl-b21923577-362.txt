342 SYPHILIS. former expression is equivalent to primary venereal sore, and there can be no objection to it if employed to include the whole of them. Primary sores, however, differ in character, and the word chancre is often used to denote one of these, and that not the most frequent, the others being considered different in their nature, and therefore not chancres, to the great confusion and discomfort of students and persons of limited experience. I do not use the word chancre in the limited sense alluded to above, but more generally as equivalent to primary sore. The secondary or constitutional symptoms are various affec- tions of the skin, eruptive and ulcerative; of the throat, tongue, and mouth; of the osseous system, namely, of the periosteum, bones, and joints; of the eye, nose, ear, testicle, larynx. These constitutional symptoms are properly syphilis or lues venerea, or in vulgar English, pox.

Syphilis, then, to use the language of grammarians is a noun of multitude. It is not a single affection of one part, but the word is used, like scrofula, to denote various diseases of several organs and textures, which proceed from one common source. The production of secondary symptoms is not essential to the notion of syphilis. Primary are not constantly followed by secondary symptoms. The latter occur only in a propor- tion of cases; which proportion has been variously stated from one third to one twentieth, or even one fiftieth. The proportion may perhaps be influenced by treatment. History.â€”The venereal disease is supposed to have been un- known to the ancients ; if so, they were happy in their igno- rance. We find, indeed, in ancient writers, such as Celsus, and in the works of other authors, scattered passages respecting affections of the generative organs, which might be supposed

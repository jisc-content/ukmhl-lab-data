MODE OE STUDY. 13 theories, which will not bear examination by the test of ana- tomy and physiology are only to be regarded as random guess- work or idle dreams. No one would attempt to mend a clock, watch, steam-engine, or the commonest piece of machinery, unless he understood its construction, unless he knew what we may call its anatomy and physiology, that is the nature of the materials which compose it, the configuration, adjust- ment, and mutual action of the parts. Yet persons are con- stantly attempting to rectify the disorders of the human machine, not only with a slight and vague knowledge of its construction, but even in perfect ignorance of it, although, as a piece of machinery, the human body is far more complicated than any instrument of human fabrication. No man who aspires to a scientific knowledge of his pro- fession can neglect the sciences of anatomy and physiology, because they afford the foundation and criterion of all medical doctrines; but correct anatomical knowledge is especially necessary to the surgeon as a preparation for his ordinary duties; without it he cannot determine the seat and nature of disease; he cannot distinguish between the affections of rantiguous parts; he cannot understand the varied nature md appropriate treatment of injuries, such as fractures, dis- locations, or wounds of blood-vessels and other soft parts. If you ask how much knowledge of anatomy is necessary ?or a surgeon, the answer is short, as much as he can get. Four study of anatomy must be general; it must embrace ;he whole frame, unless indeed you should know of auy part vhich is out of the reach of injury, or exempt from the ittacks of disease, or any region which can never be the ubject of operation. Operations, may in some instances, be executed mechani- ally, by following certain rules; but if things do not go on xactly according to the description, the operator, ignorant

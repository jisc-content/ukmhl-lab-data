Although I had declined former proposals for publishing my ' Lectures on Surgery/ I have acceded to a similar request from my friend and colleague Mr. Coote, who offered the tempting inducement of his aid in revision, correction, and carrying the work through the press. He has rendered partial assistance in the earlier pages, and would, I am sure, have afforded valuable aid throughout, if I had not soon dis- covered that an undertaking like the present must be the work of one person. In order, therefore, to relieve him from responsibility in respect to any opinions or statements in which he may not coincide, it is right to mention that he neither saw the greater part of the manuscript before it went to the printer, nor has seen a single page in print before the publication of the book. I take this opportunity of thanking him sincerely for his ready and kind offer of co-operation on this, and for his valuable services on many other occasions. I have divided the work into Chapters instead of Lectures, as the latter do not correspond with the natural divisions of subjects. The language still retains traces of lecturing, which I have not thought it necessary to efface. I have reprinted from the < London Medical Gazette' two Clinical Lectures on Syphilis, containing illustrations of some im- portant practical points. WILLIAM LAWRENCE.

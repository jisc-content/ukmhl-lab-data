538 CANCER. operating, particularly if the breast be large, that it prevents the possibility of death by ulcerated cancer, the greatest calamity that can befal a female. The operation is neither painful nor dangerous; the wound heals, and death may ensue after an uncertain length of time from some internal affection, not usually of much suffering or long duration. The important point to be kept constantly in view in per- forming the operation is the necessity of taking away all parts to which any suspicion of morbid change can attach; the incisions should go beyond the extent of the disease, and this rule holds good in respect to the skin, as well as to the deeper seated parts. The advantage of saving integu- ment enough to close the wound must give way to the imperative necessity of removing all that is diseased. As scirrhous disease of the breast, in the great majority of cases, affects a part of the mammary gland only, and as this, in many instances which afford an opportunity of early operation, is a small part at the circumference, while the rest of the gland is perfectly healthy, it may be a question whether it would be sufficient to remove the diseased part, or prefer- able to take away the entire gland. Patients are naturally averse to the latter proceeding, as involving a painful mutila- tion, which surgeons also would wish to avoid, unless the other course, although recommended for choice at the time, as a comparatively trivial operation, should be found to be followed invariably by fresh disease in the gland, and the subsequent necessity of the larger operation. The rule on which I have acted for many years, and which I believe to be generally followed in this country, though not so elsewhere, is to remove the entire gland. In two instances, at least, I have found a small portion of induration at some distance from the larger mass, and so deeply situated that it could not have been discovered before the operation. Generally, however,

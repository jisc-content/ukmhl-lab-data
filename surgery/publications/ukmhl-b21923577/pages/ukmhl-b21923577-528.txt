508 CANCERâ€”ABSORBENT GLANDS. The absorbent glands in the axilla rarely, if ever, escape par- ticipation in the disease. They are sometimes affected early, sometimes later j one or two of them may be swelled from simple irritation, which may be expected to subside when the primary disease is removed. They gradually become enlarged and scirrhous. The morbid deposit, at first partial, is strongly contrasted with the proper structure of the glands, which soon disappears, the former being substituted for it. The whole set of glands is ultimately involved, forming a hard mass, which fills the axilla. At a later period there is swelling and induration of the glands above the clavicle. As the passage through the lymphatics to the thoracic duct is now com- pletely intercepted, the upper extremity swells, sometimes becoming greatly enlarged. Of cedematous softness at first, it gradually becomes firmer, with redness, heat, and pain. In a large upper limb, this tumefaction may become very con- siderable, with active inflammation; and I have seen large suppuration, both in the upper and forearm. In rare in- stances oedema of the face, neck, and side, has been seen. The structures at the base of the disease become indurated, like those on the other surface, and thus fix it firmly to the great pectoral muscle, some fibres of which are involved in the mass, and must be removed in the operation. Small, separate cancerous deposits are sometimes found among the super- ficial fibres of the muscle. To this state of matters, in which the hard, original scirrhus, with the thick covering of indurated skin blended with it into one hard mass, which is firmly fixed to the chest, the popular name of stone-cancer is not inappropriate. After the skin has become completely involved in the disease, either by adhering to the general surface of the mass, or being drawn to it in a fold more or less deep, ulce- ration may be expected to begin. It takes place in two

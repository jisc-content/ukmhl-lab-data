UNITY OR PLURALITY OF POISONS. 351 distinct kinds of affection, which he has named after the cha- racter of the eruption, and considers as the restilt of so many- different poisons. I am aware that many of the distinctions which Mr. Carmichael has pointed out are founded in observa- tion, and you will recognise the justice of many of his remarks; but I cannot say that the combinations of symptoms which he has pointed out are so constant as to lead me to adopt the same conclusion that he has arrived at. Hitherto we possess little or no information respecting the very first point which offers itself for our investigation on the question of the unity or plurality of poisons; that is, whether each particular primary sore propagates its like or not. We have no means of settling the point by direct experiment; we cannot inoculate this complaint, as we do the smallpox. It rarely happens that we have the opportunity of comparing the disease in the person infected with that in the quarter from which the infection proceeded. There has been a want of correspondence in the small number of cases in which I have been able to make the comparison. I had a married woman under my care in the hospital with a phagedsenic sore on the nympha, which nearly destroyed the part. She had contracted this from her husband, who was attending as an out-patient at the same time. He had ulcer- ation of the glans and prepuce, without the slightest approach to the phagedcenic character. Mr. Evans, a surgeon in the army, who has published an instructive pamphlet on ulcerations of the genitals, witnessed the examination of the women of the town in some of the French cities. Many of them had dis- charge from the vagina, with consequent excoriation, hardly any had ulcerations. Yet the English soldiers, who had intercourse with these women, were affected with ulcerations in numerous instances, such as are deemed syphilitic. Both in army practice and in civil life, instances have sometimes

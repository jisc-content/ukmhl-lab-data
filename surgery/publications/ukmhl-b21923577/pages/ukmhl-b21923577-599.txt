He was obliged to travel from London to the north of England, 130 miles, in the autumn of 1833, on the outside of a coach, and felt great pain from pressure of the iron forming the margin of the hard seat against the back of one limb in the ham. The part continued swollen and painful after his return home, so as to require rest and the repeated application of leeches, by which the enlargement was considered to have been cured; it was then covered by strips of adhesive plaster. A relapse of swelling and pain, for which leeches were again tried in vain, was ascribed to the confinement of the part, and a small tumour was discovered at the back of the limb near the ham. This had increased so much by February, 1834, as to require operation, by which a considerable mass of suspicious, but not very clearly characterised morbid structure was removed from the ham. The pain ceased, and the wound healed favorably, excepting a small sinus, at which it again made its appearance, higher up on the back of the limb, and it became necessary, in June of the same year, to repeat the operation, which required a long and deep incision, with removal of muscular portions involved in the disease and altered in colour. This operation, although serious in extent and depth, turned out as favorably as the preceding. After this the health gradually improved, the wound healed, and in a few months he was capable of walking without inconvenience several miles. In the summer of 1837 he again married, his health having continued excellent up to this time, and remaining in the same favor- able state till the following winter.

SCALDS AND BUKNS. 283 the name given by the Greeks to the burnt and discoloured surface of an altar where the fire has been kindled. Hence its application to denote a burnt place in the human body. The name eschar is equally applied to parts disorganized and dis- coloured by chemical agents; and these substances are called, in reference to their action on the human body, escharotics. A slough is a part disorganized by a previous peculiar disturbance of the circulation. Eschar denotes disorgani- zation by immediate chemical action. Thus, eschar is an effect of external, slough that of internal agency. The essential nature of the disturbances excited by the action of heat on the human frame, that is, of the inflam- mation, with its local effects of serous effusion, suppuration, and mortification, the subsequent processes of granulation and cicatrization, and of its sympathetic influences, is not different from that of the corresponding effects consequent on the action of other causes. The two points of consequence are, the degree of injury, that is, whether it be inflammation and vesication, or disorganization, and its extent. The prognosis turns principally on the latter; the slighter mischief, when extensive, is dangerous; the most considerable, when of small extent, is free from risk. In the worst cases, the powers of life are prostrated by the shock of the injury, and never recover; death ensues in a few hours. In extensive burns of a less serious description a violent impression is made on the nervous system, and hence arise disturbance and depression of the circulation, respiration, and digestive organs. The symptoms are : small, rapid, and feeble pulse ; faintness; the respiration, at first, light and failing, becomes laborious and stertorous; there is coldness of the surface with chills, shivering, lividity of countenance, sickness, and thirst. The patient may sink under the con- tinuance and aggravation of these symptoms, or reaction

DIVISIONS OF DISEASE. 35 by a French physician (Sauvages), in which diseases were arranged in species and genera, and were combined in orders and classes, in the same way that Linnaeus had adopted for plants and animals. This arrangement included 10 classes, about 300 genera, and about 4000 species. The example of Sauvages was followed by others j and various systems of nosology were published, which I need not dwell upon at length, for they are now, as they deserve, nearly forgotten. Dr. Cullen, of Edinburgh, published a system of nosology, which was generally adopted, and is still maintained in this country. Yet we find, upon examining it, that diseases are brought together which have no natural affinity; and that, m other instances, those are separated, and put into diffe- rent classes, which resemble each other. Under the division tumours we find aneurisms, varix, ecchymosis, scirrhus, cancer, bubo, sarcoma, warts, corns, hydrarthrus and exos- tosis. Dyspepsia, diarrhoea, and dysentery, are in different orders, while hydrophobia, diabetes, diarrhoea, palpitation, and epilepsy, are in the same order. If this be one of the most successful attempts at nosology, we may safely dismiss all of them from further consideration. It is a sign of sounder ideas upon the subject that these systems have fallen into disuse. The attempt to class diseases on the same principles that are foUowed in the arrangement of organized beings must fail, because the two cases are entirely different. The species of animals and plants are distinctly marked by the hand of nature, and there can be no difficulty in placing them Diseases, on the contrary, run into each other by insensible gradations; so that it is often difficult to point out the distinc tion between them, and in some instances they are different^ named by different persons. We are constantly meeting with forms of disease that are not described; and it is a

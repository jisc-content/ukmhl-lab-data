PARAPHIMOSIS. 491 is incidental to gonorrhoea and to the inflammation and ulcera- tion of syphilis. The prepuce, partially inflamed and tightened, is drawn back over the glans, perhaps with difficulty, and can- not be restored without pain. It is left in this state, either pur- posely or carelessly, with its sharp, cutaneous margin, in which the elastic tissue resides, pressing on the body of the penis, and soon deeply indenting it, as the glans inflames and swells in front. The indentation, which, if not relieved, soon becomes ulcerated, occupies the upper half of the penis, while in the lower portion, which is not subject to pressure, the lining of the prepuce pushes out in a state of oedematous swelling. The integuments of the penis swell behind, and the parts in front are thickened by inflammatory enlargement, so as to increase the depth of the indentation and to alter considerably the figure of the penis, of which the anterior portion is thrown into a curve with the concavity upwards, and a con- siderable deformity of the entire organ. The object of the surgeon is to restore the parts to their proper relative posi- tion, which will be accomplished by pushing back the glans and the oedematous prepuce, rather than by drawing forward at first the strictured portion of the prepuce, of which the position cannot be immediately altered. In order to reduce the bulk of the glans the penis is immersed in cold water, and steady pressure is then used to squeeze out the blood. The glans thus lessened is pushed downwards and backwards with the finger and thumb of the right hand, while the integuments of the penis are brought forward with those of the left. The object is soon accomplished in arecent case but when the displacement has lasted one or two weeks or even longer, more time and no inconsiderable force may be necessary.

There was a general and undefined enlarge- ment over the lower third of the sternum and the ensiform car- tilage, extending to the sternal end of the cicatrix. It was painful on pressure; the action of the heart was disturbed, and the pulse much accelerated; the countenance sallow and anxious. That the sternum was enlarged by active cancerous disease could not be doubted, and the history made it probable that the affection had begun either previously to the operation or soon after it.

Paraplegia came on, with entire loss of power over the sphincters, and she died at the end of July prom the intelligent surgeon who had operated in this case, and who examined the body, I learned that the painful symptoms preceding the paralysis, which had been considered neuralgic had come on in January. She had severe and varying irre- gularly recurring pains about the shoulders and arms, so much augmented by moving them that she remained all day in one posture. Occasionally these symptoms were exhibited m the belly and lower limbs previous to the paraplegia but were greatly relieved by the latter occurrence, and were wholly ' confined to the upper extremities, yet the lower were now and then affected with a peculiar pain, consequent on in voluntary and abrupt catching, of the legs, while the true sensibility and power of motion were gone.

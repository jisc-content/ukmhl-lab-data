CONTUSION. immediate or early amputation in bad compound fractures, and some gunshot injuries, accords entirely with, the more abundant evidence collected by the surgeons who have prac- tised in the great military hosts of recent times. In gunshot injuries of the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, there is always something individual in each case, and the circumstances are too various to admit of being brought under general rules of treatment. In a large proportion of such injuries, patients are in the greatest danger, and their only chance of recovery lies in keeping down the circulation by strict rest and regimen, and in watching closely to antici- pate the occurrence of inflammation, or to check it promptly if it should arise. Such means, aided by youth, a sound constitution, and previously good health, have frequently led to recovery from injuries which at first appeared quite des- perate. Contusion or bruise are the terms by which we denote injury without division of parts, that is, without wound. Generally, but not invariably, the vessels are so injured as to pour out blood into the cellular tissue, causing swelling, usually coming on soon, and sometimes increasing rapidly to a great and even alarming extent. In its most violent degree contusion so disorganises the part as to stop the circulation, and thus cause mortification. This is seen on a small scale in blows on the shin where the skin is violently squeezed at the time of the accident between two hard bodies. Slighter bruises, occasioning merely temporary inconvenience, are little thought of; when the injury is more considerable, it interrupts or suspends functions, as. in muscles and joints, and may lead to inflammation, particularly under neglect or imprudent exertions. The most important point of treatment is to rest the injured part for a sufficient time, and to avoid premature exertion.

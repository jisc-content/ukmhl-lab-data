272 VENOMOUS SERPENTS. the wound, if on a limb, might be resorted to. Stimuli and cordials, obviously indicated by the failing powers of life, have been freely administered; such as ether, brandy, or wine, volatile alkali locally and internally, particularly the spiritus ammoniac succinatus, under the name of Eau de Luce. In the East Indies, where venomous serpents are numerous, great reliance is placed, and not unjustly, according to Dr. Russell, in his ' History of Indian Serpents/ on a remedy called the Tanjore pill, consisting of white arsenic (arsenious acid) combined with vegetable matters, so that each pill con- tains about one grain of the arsenic. Mr. Ireland, an English army surgeon, then stationed in St. Lucia, tried the use of arsenic freely in four bad cases of bites by the most dangerous serpents of the island, and communicated the results to the Medical and Chirurgical Society, in a paper published in the second volume of their ' Transactions.' He was bold enough to give two drachms of the liquor potassas arsenitis of the London Pharmacopoeia, containing one grain of the arsenic for a dose, and to repeat it every half hour for four hours in two, and three hours in other instances, in all of which the treatment was successful. Purgative clysters were employed at the same time, and free purging took place, sometimes with vomiting. Comparing Mr. Ireland's doses of six and eight grains of arsenic swallowed in three and four hours with our own familiar experience of the fatal effects produced by much smaller quantities, we can only conclude that the serpent poison renders the human frame comparatively insensible to the immediate action of the arsenic, while it is quickly expelled from the alimentary canal, by the early and free purging, which is a part of the plan. Still, until faith in the method has been somewhat strengthened by further evidence

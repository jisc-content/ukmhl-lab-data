260 HYDROPHOBIA. only in the direct communication of the poison from another rabid animal. The French may probably have considered this point in reference to the wolf, but I have not met with any information on the subject. The animals liable to the disease, besides the human species, are chiefly the domesticated races; those brought tinder the dominion of man, and associated with him. The dog, wolf, and fox, closely allied, and breeding together, are the' most liable, hence the name of rabies canina. Of the jackal (canis aureus) we have no information. The cat, horse, ass, mule, cow, sheep, pig, goat, are subject to the disease.* All animals are not equally susceptible; perhaps dogs are most so, yet the cases from bites of wolves are frequent in France. Four men and twelve dogs were bitten by one dog; all the dogs went mad, while all the men escaped, though they used no means of prevention. Twenty persons were bitten by the same dog ; only one had the disease. (Dr. I. Hunter in < Trans, of a Society/ vol. i, p. 302.) Yet sometimes the human subject seems very susceptible. Twenty-three individuals were bitten by a female wolf; thir- teen died in the course of a few months, besides several cows wounded by the same animal. Of ten individuals bitten by a wolf nine died; of twenty-four persons bitten by a wolf, near Eochelle, eighteen perished. The disease is communicable only by the dog, wolf, cat, and fox if indeed the statement be well founded that a Duke of Richmond died in Canada from a bite by the animal last mentioned. Fromnumerous experiments made in the French veterinary school at Alfort, it appeared that herbivorous quadrupeds could not communicate the disease.

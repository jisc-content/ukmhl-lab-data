OSTEOID CANCER. G32 of the thigh five years previously. For a long time it grew very slowly and with scarcely any pain, so that he was enabled to pursue his occupation, until within the last six months; hut during that period it had rapidly increased, with much suffering, and at length, hardly able to walk, he entered the hospital. The thigh was amputated in its upper third, the femur being sawn through about two inches above the highest point where any enlargement of the bone could be detected. The sawn surfaces presented a natural aspect. Upon dissection the tumour exhibited all the characters of osteoid cancer in a well-marked form. When the integu- ments were reflected the muscles investing the tumour were found pale and softened, wasted and degenerated; and here and there in their substance appeared small circumscribed portions of firm cancer. It was difiicult with the naked eye to define the limits of the growth; it seemed to pass gradually into the adjacent muscles. The surface of the tumour was of a pale buff colour, firm, but easily cut with a knife. At a few lines below this, however, it became very hard, as hard as compact bone. A longitudinal section of the tumour made with the saw displayed its continuity with the femur; indeed the periosteum of the upper portion of the hone ap- peared to be lost over it. No distinction could be drawn between the lower portion of the shaft of the femur and the surrounding growth; the compact and cancellated structure being equally blended with the substance of the tumour into an extremely hard, dense, uniform osseous tissue. The un- ossified circumference of the tumour was composed of firm fibrous tissue, with cancer cells scattered irregularly through it. The structure of the more central ossified portion re- sembled that of ordinary bone. J. 15. AULA lit), HUNTER, BARTHOLOMEW CLOSE.

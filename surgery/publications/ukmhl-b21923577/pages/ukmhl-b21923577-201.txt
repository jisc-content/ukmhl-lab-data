ULCERATION". 181 chasm subsequently extended by any corrosive or destructive agency of pus. This fluid has no solvent power over the animal structures. The origin, progress, and general phenomena of ulceration, vary according to differences of texture in the part affected; of nature in .the inflammation, which may be common or specific; and of constitution or health in the individual. All textures are susceptible of ulceration, as we see in the separation of a mortified Kmb, where the ulceration will go through skin, cellular membrane, fascia, muscles, tendons, nerves, blood-vessels, and bone, so that the member may be detached by a natural process. But all are not equally liable; skin is the most prone, then mucous membrane, which is a kind of internal skin, and cellular tissue. It occurs fre- quently in bone, in articular cartilages, and in the cornea. Fibrous structures, such as fascia, tendon, and ligament, are the least susceptible. Hence abscesses under them are slow in coming to the surface. All newly formed parts are weaker in vitality than the original structures, and ulcerate more easily. We are best acquainted with external ulceration, where its origin, progress, and mode of repair are under our immediate observation. The following remarks apply directly to this, and, under modifications, to ulceration in other situations. External ulceration is preceded by inflammation, and generally accompanied with more or less of pain. The skin is red, of increased temperature, painful, and somewhat swollen. The cuticle becomes loosened and whitish, the part is then livid. When the loosened cuticle is removed, one or more small openings, or several slight cracks of the skin are Â« exposed; a portion of the texture has been lost, leaving a rugged, yellowish, or grayish surface, sometimes spotted* or streaked with blood; the surrounding skin is red, hot and

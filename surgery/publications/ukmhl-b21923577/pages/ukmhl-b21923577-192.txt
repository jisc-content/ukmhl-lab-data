172 CHRONIC ABSCESS. prevent re-accumulation, and thus accelerate the contraction of the cyst. With a free opening, re-accumulation cannot occur. The question then will be, whether it will be best to trust for the contraction of the cyst to the natural progress of such a case, or to attempt ensuring it by introducing into the cavity a foreign body, which is likely to excite irritation, in some cases at least. If these tubes are employed in all abscesses, the great majority will certainly get well, and we may therefore conclude that their introduction does not prevent the cure. The cases to which the preceding observations are most applicable are those in which the chronic character is most strongly marked in all respects, and particularly the psoas and lumbar diseases. The termination is so frequently un- favorable, whether they burst naturally or are evacuated by puncture, that we wittingly defer the latter measure as long as possible, employing in the meanwhile all means calculated to build up and maintain constitutional power. We are driven at last, by the increase of the swelling and the desire of the patient, to make an opening, explaining previously the dangers incidental to the changes which take place in the cyst, and observing that the termination may be regarded as sufficiently favorable if the latter is obliterated, leaving be- hind a deep fistula, of which the duration may be indefinite. There are numerous spontaneous suppurations, which, from their duration, might be termed chronic, although the at- tendant symptoms and the character of the pus approach to those of the more active kind. They may form with pain, or become painful in their progress; as they increase there is heat, and great suffering from stiffness and tension, especially when the external tissues are thick and unyielding, so that attempts at motion are almost unbearable. A free incision evacuates well-formed homogeneous pus, with perfect relief,

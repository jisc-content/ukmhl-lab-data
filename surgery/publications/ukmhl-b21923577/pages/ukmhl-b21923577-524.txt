50 i CANCEB OF THE BREAST, secondary. The disease first appears in one organ, and afterwards, in a longer or shorter time, affects the absorbent glands and various internal parts. Those most subject to the primary attack are the female breast, the uterus, the rectum, the stomach, particularly the pylorus and cardia, the tongue, the lower Hp, the female external organs of generation, the penis, and scrotum. The skin, the bones, and most of the viscera are less frequently the seat of the disease in its primary form. The testicle, prostate, and ovary, are not unfrequently enumerated among the parts subject to cancer: it occurs most rarely in these organs, if at all. The secondary affections are seen in the absorbent glands, the skin, in the thoracic and abdominal viscera, particularly the lungs and liver, and the bones. Although the absorbent glands of the first order, but not others, are invariably involved, sooner or later, they are almost exempt from the primary disease; I only remember to have seen such an affection twice, once in the axillary, once in the inguinal glands. Instead of describing cancer generally, which would be vague and unsatisfactory, I shall take the female mammary gland as an illustration; the account of the diseased change, as it occurs in this organ, of its causes, its progress, varieties, treatment, and ultimate effects, will be applicable, with some modifications, to other cases of the disease. Serious and formidable as cancer of the breast appears in the progress to its fatal termination, it begins in a mild and painless manner. This, which is called the indolent period of the complaint, is of various duration; it may last for weeks, months, or longer. A portion of the gland becomes firm to the feel, not enlarged, loosely connected to the parts around, and without adhesion either to the skin or the chest. Its presence is often detected accidentally, when it may have attained the size of a filbert or walnut. Being unattended

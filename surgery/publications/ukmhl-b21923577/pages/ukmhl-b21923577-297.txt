DISSECTION WOUNDS. 277 done so. A slight blush was observed, and Avith a lens, a minute opening in the cuticle was perceived at the centre of the red part. This was touched with nitrate of silver and with a minute quantity of nitric acid, without causing pain. He went home, and finding the finger still uneasy, as the former applications had given no pain, he again applied nitrate of silver, continuing the application till he felt it sensibly. The pain thus produced soon increased to agony, and shivering came on. Red lines were observed on the hand at half-past eight on the following morning (Dec. 29th) and an eschar, equal in size to a split pea, had formed on the finger. Leeches, fomentations and poultices, with pur- gatives were now resorted to. At 1 p.m., the last two pha- langes of the finger had mortified. The red lines now ex- tended to the elbow, with uneasiness in the axilla. There was complete prostration of strength, irregularity of breathing, and torpor, with the pulse from 90 to 100, and soft. Durin°- the rest of the day there was much heavy sleep, with intervals of pain. The hand and arm swelled, the absorbents were inflamed along the arm, and the axillary glands swelled. There was now great torpor, with depression and oppressed breathing. An erysipelatous blush arose on the axilla and side of the chest. Death took place at 6 a.m. on January the 1st—the fourth day. There is room for doubt in this case whether the fatal event was owing to the original puncture, if indeed there had been such a puncture, which does not seem quite clear, or to the very energetic escharotic treatment resorted to under the influence of apprehension and alarm. The result might have been different if fomentation and poultice had been trusted to, with opium internally. A free division of the inflamed part might have been resorted to if painful swelling and tension had supervened.

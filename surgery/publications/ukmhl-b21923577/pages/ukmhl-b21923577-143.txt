SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS. 123 When the important functions of digestion, absorption, assimilation, nutrition, and excretion are disordered, the com- position of the blood must be altered. This " living and cir- culating flesh," as a German writer has not inaptly though somewhat poetically called it, must be vitiated by the intro- duction of ill-prepared supplies and the retention of matters which ought to have been eliminated. Chemistry has not yet succeeded in disclosing the exact nature and extent of these changes, though the French inquirers, particularly Andral and Gavarret, have investigated successfully the varying proportions in which the several constituents of the blood are found in various diseases. All observations prove that the proportion which the red blood corpuscles bear to the other constituents of the circulating fluid is in direct relation to the activity and vigour of animal power. Andral found the globules to be only 287 instead of 127 per 1000 in a case of extreme chlorosis; at the same time there was a corresponding increase of water from 790 to 8687. The pallid state of the skin and countenance in those whose nervous system has been severely depressed by long continued constitutional unhealthiness, shows unmistakeably a defi- ciency in the red colouring matters of the blood. The progress of chemical science may throw further light on this interesting department of pathology. We should understand but imperfectly the sanitary state of a patient if we omitted to inquire carefully into the nature and quantity of his food and drink, the number and times of meals, also the habits of living, in respect to exercise in the open air, and mental occupation. Local treatment, although of secondary importance, is not to be neglected in spontaneous inflammationsj such measures as the state of the part may require should be resorted to according to the directions in preceding chapters.

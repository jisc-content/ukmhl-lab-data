430 SECONDARY SYPHILIS. laryngitis may originate from syphilis, and require the opera- tion of laryngotomy. The several symptoms now detailed, which make np the constitutional form of lues venerea, neither occur indiscrimi- nately nor in any regular and invariable sequence. Some are usually met with earlier and others later, hut there is considerable variety in this respect, and in protracted cases the early symptoms, such as eruptions and sore throat, often reappear in an advanced period of the disease. Mr. Hunter distinguishes a first and second order of parts in constitutional syphilis, acknowledging that the order is inverted in some cases. Under the first he includes the skin, tonsils, nose, throat, inside of the mouth, and sometimes the tongue j under the second the periosteum, fasciae, and bones. Some modern writers call these respectively secondary and tertiary; there is, however, no regularity in this point, the order as Mr. Hunter has observed, being sometimes inverted, while secondarv and tertiary symptoms occur together not infrequently. Nodes and affection of the testicle, though usually late, may occur early, the former particularly. Affec- tions of the throat and skin, which are commonly the first constitutional symptoms, occur frequently in the advanced stage of the complaint. The nose, which Mr. Hunter has placed in the first order of parts, seldom suffers until a comparatively late period. The diseases of this organ, of the ear, the testicle, the larynx, and the joints, are certainly of late occurrence with few exceptions, and deep ulcers of the skin may be added to the list Two, three, or more secondary symptoms are generally seen together, but I have met with sore throat, nodes and iritis, as single and sole evidences of constitutional affection. Mr Carmichael has attempted to show that certain secondary symptoms can be traced to particular sores as

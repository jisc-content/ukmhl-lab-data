CAUSES. 211 I have seen mortification of a blistered surface brought on by dressing with savine ointment in young and weakly children more than once. Indeed, this remedy should not be resorted to at all in young subjects without great precaution as to the size and power of the blister, and the duration of the application. Internal causes.â€”An unsound state of constitution, induced and maintained by indulgence of appetite and inactivity, con- stitutes a predisposition to attacks of inflammation, and even mortification. The effect is too obvious to escape notice, when bad habits are carried to excess. But the same in- fluences in a minor degree, such as may not appear to pass much beyond the bounds of prudence, especially if accom- panied by indolence, may, in the course of years, gradually undermine the powers of the system. The mischief proceeds so slowly as to escape the notice of the individual until his attention is roused by an attack of disease. The most trivial injury, especially to a part remote from the centre of circu- lation, such as a superficial cut on a toe, may cause mortifi- cation under such circumstances. Is the real cause of the mischief here in the local injury, or in the unsoundness of constitution ? How is the matter to be explained, if, as not unfrequently happens, a black spot appears spontaneously on a f.np ? J The habits now alluded to may, by long continuance, so disorder and weaken the most important internal organs as to cause great general debility favorable to the occurrence of spontaneous mortification, or to its occurrence from a local injury. A strong predisposition to spontaneous gangrene originates in an imperfect state of the circulation, caused by disease of the arteries. The coats of these vessels, not only in the trunks, but in the ramifications as far as we can trace them

208 MORTIFICATION. morbid states, or when overdriven oxen are slaughtered. It is also mentioned under the term charbon. An external inflammation soon goes on to mortification, extending rapidly, and often fatal. I once saw this affection in a mild form occurring in a man who had been employed in Leadenhall Market, and had to overhaul parcels of hides from South America, which often arrive in a very bad state. One of them swept along his cheek, and he was aware that it touched the skin. The cheek, for an inch and a half in depth immediately below the eyelid, swelled and became red, as by erysipelas.

I saw two healthy boys employed in a manufactory of this article, in each of whom there was a nearly circular black slough on the forearm, about the size of a shilling in one, and of a sixpence in the other. It occupied the thickness of the skin and the subja- cent tissue, and was accounted for by their having handled the foul horsehair. The affection was completely local, and soon terminated by cicatrization after the slough had sepa- rated. Sloughing primary syphilitic sores show the serious mis- chief that may be caused by a poison applied to the sound surface of a previously healthy person. The subject will be further considered under the head of syphilis. In sloughing phagedena, which is indirectly connected with venereal disease there is a combination of ulceration and mortification pro- duced by the local influence of acrimonious discharges. A similar combination is seen in hospital gangrene, as the effect

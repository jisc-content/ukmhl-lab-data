I have seen many cases in which the prepuce has been slowly eaten away, nearly to its attachment, by a process so Httle painful that the patient has hardly sought for a remedy. In all of them the regular and mild use of mercury, in the hospital, has soon stopped the progress of the disease and effected a sound cure.

TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 103 Cold.â€”The increased heat of inflamed parts would lead naturally to the application of cold water. Patients would of themselves apply cold fluids to relieve the burning heat of an inflamed part. The external application of cold lessens vascular disturbance, causing contraction of the distended vessels, and consequently diminution of redness and heat. The general and local effects of cold are similar; when carried to the full extent, it is capable' of arresting vital action altogether. Torpor, insensibility, reduction and cessation of circulation, even death, ensues from continued general ex- posure. In a part so affected you remark a deathy paleness, from stoppage of circulation, as frostbite, in which, unless judiciously managed, ends in mortification. Thus, by the judicious application of cold we can lessen the temperature of an external part, not only with relief to the patient's feelings but with corresponding diminution of the inflammation. The well-known effect of cold in checking haemorrhage shows its influence on the vascular system. Its utility is not confined to external inflammations j parts not far below the surface experience the beneficial effects of cold applied ex- ternally, as in diseases of joints and of the cranial contents. For the purpose of producing the desired effects, we generally apply fluids called lotions or washes. Folded linen or lint, dipped in water and squeezed, so as to be wet but not dripping, laid on the part and frequently renewed, or frequent sponging so as to keep the surface moist, are suitable means. Lotions or washes are applied cold, but the effectual cooling of a part, for the purpose of abating and removing inflammation, does not depend so much on the low temperature of the liquid as on its evaporation. We must, therefore, employ our lotions in such a way that they may evaporate, hence called evaporating lotions. For this purpose the pari, when

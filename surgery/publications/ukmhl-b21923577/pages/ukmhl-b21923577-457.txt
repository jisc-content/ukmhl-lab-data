BONES AND JOINTS. 437 face are soft, obviously containing matter, but it is not necessary to puncture them. I saw a gentleman in the spring of the year with a large periosteal swelling on the forehead; it was soft, without red- ness or pain, and the health was good. Four years previously there had been slight sores on the glans, which got well in three weeks, without the use of mercury. A long course of second- ary symptoms, eruptions, sore throat, iritis, and circular sores, in various repetitions and under different modes of treatment, ensued. An incision down to the bone had been strongly recommended, but declined. The health being quite good under sarsaparilla, which had been taken for some time, I advised that it should be continued, with an evaporating lotion to the swelling if it should become heated. He continued well through the summer, following his profession, that of a barrister, actively. In the beginning of September there was a soft swelling, nearly two inches in circumference, at the upper part of the frontal bone, and a smaUer near the brow. There was a general swelling over the ossa nasi, containing matter, with redness and thinness of the skin. By the middle of October the matter had entirely disappeared from the nose, the skin remaining red, with doubt whether it adhered soundly to the bone. In November, the skin over the nose still remaining red, there was slight discharge from a minute opening, which soon closed. At the end of the month the periosteal affections had entirely disappeared, the patient was in excellent health, and there was no return of disease. The course of the disease has been equally favorable in the great majority of similar cases which have come under my observ- ation. When a periosteal node continues very painful, in spite of all means, local and general, the only remedy that remains is a free division of the part in its whole length down to the bone

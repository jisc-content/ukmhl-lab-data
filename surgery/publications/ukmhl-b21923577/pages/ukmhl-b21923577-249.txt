SENILE GANGRENE.- 229 The slough may separate entirely, the exposed surface granulating and cicatrizing rapidly. We suppose a cure is at hand, but the mischief reappears and spreads. It came on from an accidental injury to the shin in a gentleman of seventy of indolent and studious habits, fond of indulgence m diet, and rather corpulent. It extended considerably, healing in the parts first affected, but got well by rest in the horizontal posture with regulated diet. In a female of seventy-two, the affection, seated in the leg, began with bright redness of the skin and then slough, the latter separated and the parts healed; she seemed well, but sloughing recurred, at last going deeper and proving fatal at the end of several weeks. The pain was most severe in this case, requiring large doses of opium and the liquor sedativus. The latter was useful as a local application, proving sedative in that form. Quinine and port wine were the most advantageous remedies, purgatives being required and used with much ad- vantage, when the narcotics were freely administered. I saw a gouty gentleman of sixty-five who had been a free liver, and accustomed tojstrong exercise, which he had latterly given up, at the same time living low. He was thin, sallow, and feeble; the feet and legs rather cedematous and red ; on one leg, a little above the ankle, there was a portion of dead skin about an inch long and half as broad, dark and livid rather than black, without surrounding redness; on the other leg, below the ankle there was a watery vesicle the size of a bean. The feet and legs had been hot and painful at night, but not in the day. The treatment included the horizontal position, bread poultice, good diet, with four or six glasses of wine and mild aperients. The pain at night was immediately relieved. The skin under the vesicle sloughed and separated the larger mortified portion in the other leg came away slowly, and the patient returned to the country in three weeks

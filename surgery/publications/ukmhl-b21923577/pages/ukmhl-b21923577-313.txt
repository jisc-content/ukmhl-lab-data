293 ESCHAROTICS. full strength it is a powerful escharotic, quickly disorganizing and blackening the textures to which it is applied, though not acting through the cuticle. It will thus advantageously supersede the actual cautery as a means of arresting haemor- rhage. Even when considerably diluted it coagulates albumen and thus affords assistance in stopping bleeding. The acid nitrate of mercury, in which the metal is dissolved by the aid of heat in an excess of acid, is an escharotic fluid used in France, being applied by means of a camel-hair brush. It is less potent than the perchloride of iron. Arsenious acid (white arsenic) is a powerful escharotic, capable of destroying parts to which it is applied, producing a brownish-white, tough slough, on the separation of which a healthy granulating surface follows. The possibility of its absorption and consequent poisonous action is the strongest objection to its employment for purposes which can be answered equally well by other agents of perfectly safe cha- racter. Nitric, muriatic, sulphuric acids, and the chloride of antimony, are powerful escharotics, of which the destructive action is not attended with any other danger to the part or to the constitution. The latter, however, is almost out of use, although its effect is said to be produced without great pain.

361 USE OP MERCURY. syphilis, being resorted to where small doses, such as the eighth or sixteenth of a grain, are to be administered, more especially where there may be some doubt respecting the propriety of using mercury at all, when the small quantity last mentioned may be given two or three times a day. It was introduced into practice in consequence of the enco- miums bestowed on it by Van Swieten, who practised at Vienna; hence it came to be used generally on the continent, particularly in France, where it was exhibited in solution under the name of 'Liqueur de Van Swieten/ Forty years ago all the cases, whether of primary or secondary symptoms, at the Venereal Hospital in Paris, were treated with this remedy. The formula thus employed contained one grain of bichloride in an ounce of distilled water, and the quantity usually given, was half an ounce, that is, half a grain twice a day, rather a large allowance. The remedy was carried round with the physicians when they made their visits, and the requisite portion was poured out and drank by each patient in the presence of the medical attendant; so that at all events the administration of the remedy was ascertained. The dose was generally taken in milk or thin mucilage. The Liquor Hydrargyri Bichloridi of the 'London Pharmacopoeia/ has half a grain of bichloride in an ounce, so that one dram contains the sixteenth part of a grain. A grain may be dis- solved in an ounce of tincture of bark; a teaspoonful, which contains the eighth of a grain, may be taken three times a day. The red oxide of mercury, which was formerly called Hydrargyrum Calcinatum, was at one time occasionally given for the purpose of affecting the system; a grain, or a grain and a half, being administered twice a-day, generally in com- bination with opium. This is a powerful agent, and irritates the alimentary canal; hence, having no particular advantages it is now discarded from practice, at least in this country.*

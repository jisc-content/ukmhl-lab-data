DIVISIONS OF DISEASES. 31 ance in the circulation of the part, which, when it has reached a certain point, is called inflammation, as it is commonly attended with some increase of temperature. This disturb- ance affects the nutrition of the part, and thus causes, by its progress and continuance, more or less change in its com- ponent textures, which may be called effects or consequences of the disorder. Inflammations are not all of one kind; and there is one leading distinction which it is necessary to notice in adverting thus generally to the disease. It is divided into common and specific: the former is produced by ordinary causes acting on healthy constitutions, by a wound, for instance, inflicted on a person in good health. Other external agents will act in the same way. Specific diseases are those in which the constitution of the patient is unhealthy, either from hereditary or acquired imperfection, scrofula, gout, and rheumatism are examples; or they may arise from one definite and specific cause, as in syphilis, smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, and contagious diseases generally; and by no other. Specific inflammation, thus excited, is nearly similar to the common, the difference consisting merely in modifi- cations. As the vascular disturbance constituting inflammation presents at least an appearance of increased vital activity in the seat of disease, a question might naturally occur, whether cases are not met with of opposite character, where, in short the circulation is weakened, and the local changes are charac- terised by debility and want of restorative power. Cold re duces the circulation of a part, and if continued, will arrest vital ackonaltogether; circulation is impeded in the extremities of old persons so as to cause loss of vitality. The state of good health is the most effectual preventive of disease, and when combined with soundness of constitution, may render a

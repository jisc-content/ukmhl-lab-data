Although gout and rheumatism are rather medical than surgical subjects, the morbid states designated by these terms are chiefly known by producing local disease; thus as sur- geons often have to treat cases called gouty or rheumatic, we cannot entirely omit the subject. We naturally inquire what is the real nature of the disease in the cases called gouty and rheumatic ? Whether the inflam- mation of the joints, particularly of the fibrous and synovial membranes of the joints, in cases called gouty and rheumatic, is essentially different from common inflammation ?

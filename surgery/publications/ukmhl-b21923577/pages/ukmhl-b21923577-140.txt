In order to ascertain the state of health in an individual, the various functions must be systematically examined. A person in perfect health should not be conscious that he has a stomach and intestinal canal. If, therefore, the introduction of food should excite, more or less immediately, uneasiness in any form or degree, more especially if it amount to pain or cause tenderness on pressure in the epi- gastric region, and further, if there should be flatulence, acidity, or the other annoyances referred to dyspepsia, there is imperfection of digestion, and the habits of diet are in fault. Appetite may be irregular, either deficient or capri- cious. There is sometimes craving for food, which leads to overloading the stomach. The appearance of the tongue generally depends on the state of the stomach; when that organ is disordered it is seldom clean, but covered by a whitish, greyish, or yellowish coating; it is greyish, with red edge and tip, in gastro-intestinal affections; it is seldom quite clean in the regular inhabitants of London. Irregularity in the expulsion of the faeces often exists, generally also costiveness, followed sometimes by, or alter- nating with griping and purging. The discharges indicate clearly an unnatural state of the biliary and intestinal secretions, and a defective execution of those changes which the food undergoes before the expulsion of its residue.

The intestines sometimes contain an accumulation of fsecal matter, although motions may have been produced.

SCROFULA. 315 into a fibrous, dense kind of substance, which is slowly separated. It is a loss of vitality peculiar to scrofula, and generally associated with suppuration. Scrofula frequently appears in the form of chronic inflam- mation. The part is enlarged, perhaps slightly red, sometimes not discoloured. The affection lasts a long time without es- sentially impairing functions, or at least leading to any serious ill consequence. It is enlargement without important change of structure. Sometimes, however, adventitious deposits of tu- berculous character or of cheesy or curdy matter take place. The formation of tubercles is a common and character- istic form of scrofula, especially in internal organs. These are small grayish or whitish bodies, varying in size from that of a pin's head upwards; tolerably firm, not organized. They are irregularly disseminated, increasing in number, coalescing into groups; they gradually soften, loosen, and are broken up, portions of the tubercular matter coming away. A peculiar kind of suppuration occurs, and thus ex- tensive destruction of parts may ensue, as in the case of the lungs. The tuberculous matter may be deposited in larger and irregular masses, and may be infiltrated in the substance of an organ. In one shape or other this tubercular mischief is incidental to most of the structures and organs of the body. Scrofulous ulceration is languid and inactive, with thin discharge. The surface of the sore is pale or livid, without granulation. The margin may be smooth, red, and elevated. Sometimes the base is raised a little. The ulcers which remain after a scrofulous abscess are indolent, the cicatrices being more or less raised, puckered, and irregular. Scrofulous sores often go on long with little change. The parts most susceptible of scrofulous disease arc, in the first place, the absorbent glands, more particularly those of the neck and mesentery. The glands of the groin are

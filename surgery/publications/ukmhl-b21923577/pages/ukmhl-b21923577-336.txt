316 SCROFULA. rarely affected; and those of the axilla still less frequently. One of the principal exciting causes of scrofulous diseases is exposure to cold; hence it is that the glands of the neck are so frequently the seat of the scrofulous attack. The mesenteric glands suffer from the irritation of the alimentary mucous membrane, to -which the scrofulous are very liable, the glandular affection being here secondary, as it is in so many other instances. The glands suffer in various ways: from inflammation and suppuration, which are most frequently but not always chronic. The skin becomes thin, red., and livid, then ulce- rates. Thin pus escapes sometimes with portions of cheesy substance,and a languid, scrofulous ulcer ultimately remains. There may be simple enlargement without pain; the gland is loose, the surrounding cellular texture being unaffected. One gland or several may be affected. The whole chain may be involved under the jaw, from ear to ear, and down the neck, forming great, unsightly swellings, without change in the skin. Sometimes a succession of inflammations, sup- purations, and ulcerations, gradually attacks all these glands, leaving the jaw and neck covered with scars. Occasionally there is interstitial deposition of chalky matter, in the glands. 2. Scrofula, in some of its various shapes, attacks other parts of glandular structure, such as the lip, eyelids, female breast, testicle. 3. Mucous membranes, particularly that of the eye, so constantly exposed to all the most powerful external causes of disease; that of the nose, throat, and respiratory organs, and that of the alimentary canal, so easily disordered by irregu- larities of diet. The urinary mucous surfaces, not being exposed by their situation or office to similar exciting causes, generally escape. 4. The skin, so necessarily exposed to all the external

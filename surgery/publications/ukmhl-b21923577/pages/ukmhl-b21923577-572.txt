EPITHELIAL CANCER. 552 removed by the knife. The application was followed by the most severe pain, which lasted for several days and nights. The separation of the slongh was followed by healthy granu- lation and apparently sound cicatrization. Within a month, however, an indurated tubercle formed in the cicatrix, and became very painful. The patient now readily consented to the use of the knife, and the part was accordingly excised; the patient 3aid that the pain was nothing in comparison with the dreadful agony and long suffering caused by the escharotic. The excision was permanently successful. Caustic and irritating applications are not unfrequently tried in superficial affections of obstinate and enduring character, of which patients naturally desire to get rid, almost invariably with the effect of inducing increased activity and pain in complaints previously indolent and nearly sta- tionary. In such cases there is a choice between two courses, leaving things alone with protection and soothing, or effectual extirpation by the knife. Still the escharotic plan may be preferred occasionally for special reasons. I have removed in two instances a single diseased absorbent gland of moderate size from below and within the margin of the lower maxillary bone, in cases where diseased portions of the lower lip had been previously excised. In one of these, though there had been thickening and hardening of the entire red edge with roughness and some small excrescences, the nature of the disease may have been considered doubtful. The condition of the gland deviated considerably from the healthy structure, presenting appearances sufficiently sus- picious to make me satisfied with having recommended and performed the removal. This took place many years ago; the parts concerned in it, and the lip, have continued perfectly sound. The other instance was that of an hospital patient, who left the institution after the wound had healed.

That he succeeded in this way, in making a portion of skin from the forearm adhere to that of the face, and thus in covering over the chasm left by the loss of the external nose, we can easily admit; but a stronger degree of faith is necessary in order to believe some other of his statements, viz., that the new noses smell more acutely than the original, and grow larger and stronger, also that hair grows on them so abundantly, that they require shaving. The Asiatic method of restoring the nose by means of a portion of skin from the forehead, is described in the 'Gentleman's Magazine/ for 1794 (October). Duhamel, in the ' Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences/ 1746, mentions that it was a common practice in the poultry yards of France to engraft the spurs of young cocks on their combs. He did this, and in many instances they became adherent, and grew, even to the length of some (4) inches. This fact was verified by Mr. Hunter, and the result of his experiments may be seen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. It is reported that new noses have sometimes been made in India with a portion of skin cut from the buttock, but we have no clear and authentic statement on the subject. Professor Biinger, of Marburg, employed a similar operation on a female, in whom the prominent part of the nose had been lost, and the neighbouring skin was in an unhealthy state from herpes. He took the skin from the upper and outer part of the thigh, employing this operation because a larger piece of skin was required than he could procure from the forehead. He cut a piece four inches long and tliree wide. An hour and a half elapsed before he could close the sutures. Union took place, and the skin retained its vitality, except

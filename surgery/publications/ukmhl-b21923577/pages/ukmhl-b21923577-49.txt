DIVISIONS OF DISEASES. 29 notions in physiology and pathology as the study of the solid structures of the body. It was near the middle of the last century, that our countryman Hewson made his laborious and successful examination of the blood, which a modern Erench physiologist has characterised by the bold but not inapt expression of circulating flesh [chair coulante) and not long afterwards Mr. Hunter began those researches on this fluid in all its various conditions of development, health, disease, and accident which constitute the foundation of his principles in physiology and pathology. All organs may be primarily diseased, experiencing dis- turbance from causes acting on them in the course of their ordinary functions; or they may suffer secondarily, in con- sequence of disease previously existing in some other parts. Boiling water or a blister applied to the skin, or a wound, will cause - inflammation as their primary effects. When the stomach is disordered by particular articles of food, such as shell-fish in some individuals, or otherwise overloaded, in- flammation of the skin may be excited, in the shape of nettle- rash or erysipelas, as a secondary affection. Determination of blood to the head, excessive or long-continued mental exertion, will cause giddiness or other forms of cerebral disorders, while similar symptoms may be brought on by a disordered stomach or overloaded bowels. Primary disease is also called idiopathic, as being brought on by a cause immediately acting upon the part; while the secondary is termed symptomatic or sympathetic, as being caused by the previous existence of disease in some other organ of the body. Various views have been entertained respecting the se- condary affections, which are constantly coming under our notice, with a view to determine the primary disorder to

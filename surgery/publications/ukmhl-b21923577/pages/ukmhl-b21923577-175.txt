SUPPURATION. 155 charging the matter by punctureâ€”leads to the most favor- able termination of the disease. The formation of pus in phlegmonous inflammation, its most frequent effect, relieves or terminates the local disturbance; as the matter advances to the surface, the inflammatory swelling and induration of surrounding structures lessen and disappear, and the ulcera- tion of the thinned skin completes a series of salutary pro- cesses, by which the sides of the collection are brought into the most favorable state for contracting and coalescing so as to obliterate the cavity. An early opening not only inter- rupts the natural process of cure, but often excites fresh inflammation. The sides of the puncture made in parts of some thickness will unite by adhesion if left in contact, while, if distended by lint, they become irritated and painful, the ultimate result being a protracted and less favorable cure. These dangers may be avoided by delaying the puncture till the skin has become red and thin, that is, nearly in the state to which it is brought previously to natural bursting. Suppuration, however, occurs in such a variety of structures and situations, that we cannot establish any single rule for its surgical treatment. It is often expedient, or even necessary, to resort to a more or less early puncture, in order to lessen the amount or limit the extent of the mischief. When, then, may abscesses be left to their natural course ? and what are the cases in which the matter ought to be dis- charged by an artificial opening? They may be left to themselves when seated superficially, and in parts of little consequence, and particularly when instead of spreading in the circumference, the collection is advancing favorably to the surface. The following heads will comprise nearly all the cases in which surgical inter- ference is necessary. 1. Where matter forms deeply, and when, consequently, its

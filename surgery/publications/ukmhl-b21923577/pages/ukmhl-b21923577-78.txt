58 INFLAMMATION, ance of its structure, or as a distinct mass or paten. The matter thus poured out constitutes the source of adhesions between the margin of the pupil and the capsule of the lens. When lymph is deposited interstitially in the various textures the phenomena are more obscure, as the effused matter is blended with the natural structure. All the tissues are thickened, condensed, and closely adherent, so that great stiffness or entire loss of motion may result. Such an occurrence in the right hand of a labourer or mechanic may render him entirely unfit for his occupation. Inflammation may leave behind in the affected parts, he testicle for example, a degree of hardness fully equal to that of scirrhus, and this change, with its possible degeneration into cancer, has not unfrequently been stated in works of apparently good authority among the effects of inflammation. The hardness, however, in this case is simple induration without anything of malignant character. In scirrhus, without Zj previous inflammation, a malignant grow h is found in lieu of the natural structure, while more or less obvious traces of the latter are seen in simple induration caused by Iflammation, which has never, in my experience, assumed â€¢ n malienant character. You are not to understand that each iuflammatmn produces one only of these effects; on the contrary, dependmg as they do! on differences in the degree or mtenstty of ft. tlLce, they are usually confined, affectmgdjflment portions of the same part.

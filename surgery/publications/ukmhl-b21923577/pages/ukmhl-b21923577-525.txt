To the question, how long it has existed, the patient often replies that she does not know, that it had attained the actual size when she first noticed it. The unaffected portion of the gland retains its healthy structure. More rarely the affection begins in the centre of the gland, under the nipple and areola, and gradually extends to the circumference. The surface of the growth may be uniform or uneven; it may be circumscribed, or connected more or less firmly to the healthy portion of the gland.

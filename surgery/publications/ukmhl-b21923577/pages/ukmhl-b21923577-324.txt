ou-* TETANUS. The pathology of tetanus, therefore, still remains obscure. We naturally look to the spinal cord and the medulla ob- longata, but discover no clear evidence in these quarters. The voluntary muscles are obviously influenced sympa- thetically by the local injury through the medium of the nervous system; but we have not hitherto discovered how the spinal cord or other part of the nervous apparatus is affected, nor what is the source or character of the influence disturbing it. Costiveness, which has been observed as a marked feature of the affection by Boyer, has been present generally, if not invariably, and to a high degree, in the cases which have fallen under my own observation. Mr. Abernethy proposes the question, What is the state of the stomach and digestive organs between the receipt of the injury and the occurrence of tetanus? thereby implying the opinion that a loaded state of the alimentary canal may be one source of the mischief. Great alleviation of the spasms, and some- times their complete temporary subsidence, are produced by an effective clearance of the large accumulations, which often fill the intestines at the time of the attack. The prognosis is always very serious in traumatic tetanus, but much less so in the idiopathic form which is common in hot countries, where it often ends favorably; hence confi- dence in treatment and expectations of success are stronger in the latter than in the former. The more acute the form of the disease the more dangerous, and vice versa. Hippo- crates observed that if the patient survives the fourth day the chances are better, and Dr. Parry states that if the pulse does not exceed 100 or 110 on the fourth day there are great hopes ('Cases of Tetanus/ &c, 1814). Treatment.â€”The first question is, considering that the symptoms are the consequence of a local cause, will the removal of the cause put a stop to them ? In other words,

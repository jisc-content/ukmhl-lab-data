USE OP MERCURY. 379 mouth sufficient ? Will all the benefit that the remedy can confer be derived from it when it just perceptibly acts on the system, or may not a more considerable influence be ne- cessary, either generally or in particular cases? Then, further, is it sufficient to continue the remedy until, ulcera- tion having been arrested, the healing process has begun, and a healthy condition of the part is established ? If we leave it off at this point, relapse of ulceration will often occur, and it is necessary to resume the treatment. We must therefore go on till cicatrization is completed. Is it of any use to go further, in order to diminish the chance of relapse or of secondary symptoms ? We are still in the dark on these points, respecting which we consult the best authorities in vain. It would require a great and peculiar field of practice, a long course of time, with patient observation and mature reflexion, to collect such a body of evidence as would enable us to lay down positive rules on the subject. Mr. Hunter contends, in respect to the venereal disease, that mercury will cure the action or the existing disease, but not the disposition or the state of constitution which may lead to future appearances. The latter point is sufficiently estab- lished by the ordinary course of experience. Yet, in detailing the histories of cases, we find him going on with mercury after the symptoms had disappeared, in order to protect the constitution. Patients are often disposed to take this view of the subject, and thus the mercurial course is often con- tinued in a mild degree for one or two weeks after the symptoms have disappeared. The substance next in efficacy to mercury in the treatment of syphilis is the iodide of potassium, which, however, has no claim to be regarded, like mercury, as a specific against the disease generally. It exerts no power over the primary symptoms, but is very useful in the secondary affections,

SYPHILIS. 469 saw him in the evening. There was little or no swelling of the penis, and not much pain. I directed him to return home immediately; to go to bed, and remain there; to apply as many leeches as he could place on the penis; to use poppy fomentation and bread poultice, and take opening medicine. I told him that swelling and pain might be expected, and that a division of the prepuce would then be necessary. I did not see him again till the end of two days, when he was considerably worse. The penis and prepuce were swelled, but not considerably; the latter could only be withdrawn with difficulty. He had been in great pain for the last twenty-four hours, and had not slept during the preceding night. I divided the prepuce in its whole length. There was free bleeding, especially from one artery, and twentv ounces of blood flowed from the incision. Half the glans had mortified. The parts were now covered with the charcoal poultice, which is an excellent application, both for correcting fetor, and improving the condition of sloughing sores. The division of the prepuce at once relieved the pain, and it arrested the sloughing process. The latter effect has always ensued, within my observation, when the glans has been com- pletely denuded in this way. The debility and the mental depression necessarily attendant on such an affection, and the treatment, required a nutritious and generous diet with tonics and restoratives; these means improved and maintained strength.

264 HYDROPHOBIA. by a bright object, such as a mirror seen suddenly; by a strong light, or draught of air. There is now excessive cerebral excitement with delirium, spasms, and sometimes ungovern- able screams. There are intervals of comparative rest, with paroxyms of spasm and suffering, which soon wear out the patient, the time of death varying from thirty-six hours to five or possibly six days. There is not the slightest foundation for the notion that the unfortunate sufferers attempt to bite those near them, or that they utter sounds resembling the barking of a dog. Examination after death shows vascular disturbance in the brain, and some slight redness of the pharynx, but nothing to throw light on the peculiar character of this terrible disease. Dr. Hertwig has minutely described the morbid appearances in the dog, from nearly 200 dissections. He says that he has seen all the appearances described by others, but " with all the pains I took I have been unable to discover any constant change of structure, or one peculiar to rabies; and that, like the symptoms during life, the appearances after death are very different in their nature, extent, and intensity." (f Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ.,' vol. xxxii, p. 384.) Treatment.â€”All attempts to arrest the complaint have been hitherto unsuccessful; not a single case of recovery has been authenticated. Opium has been given by the mouth, by clyster, and by injection into the veins, in large doses, with some temporary, but no permanent benefit. Patients are not readily susceptible of the action of narcotics in this disease; such medicines must, therefore, be administered freely in order to produce even short relief. A pint of tepid water injected into the veins, by direction of Magendie, caused temporary tranquillity, withpower of swallow- ing liquids; but the symptoms returned with the usual fatal result. Bloodletting has been tried largely, without any effect.

MORTIFICATION. 205 surrounding soft textures have perished as in sloughing bubo. There i3 great variety of character and progress in different organs. If the disturbance which has caused the mortification continues, this change extends to fresh parts. The mortified portion has no clear boundary, or rather it is shaded off by a dusky red or livid border to the surrounding parts, which exhibit a deep-red colour. But, when it stops, a clearly defined line marks the limit of the dead portion. The neigh- bouring part then assumes a bright-red tint. A process now begins for separating from the living the dead portion or slough. There is a well-marked line between them, with a removal of particles constituting a superficial groove, which deepens more or less rapidly, and gradually extends through- out, so as to detach entirely or throw off the slough. Granu- lations arise from the exposed living structures in the groove, and are formed successively, in proportion as the detachment proceeds; so that a healthy granulating surface is seen when the slough is at last pushed off. What is the phy- siological explanation of this process? Is it ulceration, or absorption ? Mr. Hunter, always inclined to ascribe great power to the absorbing system, regarded these processes as identical, that is, he considered the breaches of surface con- stituting ulcers to be the work of the absorbents, and this opinion has been generally adopted. Recently, and perhaps more correctly, ulceration has been deemed to be a modifica- tion of local death, in which the lost substance perishes in minute detail, instead of losing vitality in the mass as it does in mortification. There is no doubt on the point of repair, which is simply a specimen of healing by granulation and cicatrization. As the separation extends through all the component textures when an entire portion of a limb has perished, the

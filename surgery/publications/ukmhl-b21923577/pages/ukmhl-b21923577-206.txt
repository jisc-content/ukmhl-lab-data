186 ULCERATION. tissue, as in bad burns, the contraction, which proceeds, though slowly, with an almost irresistible power, draws together such moveable parts as are within its range, and fixing them in unnatural positions, by hard, puckered, and ugly cicatrices, causes, especially in the face, neck, and flexures of the limbs, most distressing deformities, often admitting of only partial remedy. Reproduction.â€”Is the cavity of a large ulcer, or that of an abscess, filled up by reproduction of the lost textures before it is healed over ? It has been supposed and described that the lost parts, whether skin, cellular membrane, muscle, or others, are reproduced. The loss of substance, however, is rather apparent than real. The inflammatory swelling of surrounding parts gives a deceptive appearance of excavation; and as this subsides, we discover that there has been no loss except of skin, aod consequently no necessity for reproduction. That new matter springs up for the repair of ulcers cannot be doubted. Granulation is the formation of a new organ in the economy for a temporary purpose. But the effect is limited to the uniting of wounds, or filling up of breaches, and does not extend to the reproduction of lost parts. There is a wide contrast between man and the lower animals in this respect. In man no lost part or organ is restored, except the shaft of a long bone; separated parts are united, and that by a medium, which, though clearly distinguishable from the original, answers the end, and enables the part to execute its function, as in muscle, tendon, bone, and even nerve, The breaches of ulceration are closed externally, but the lost substance of a wound or a destructive sore is not repro- duced. Hence skin becomes fixed after recovery to muscles or fascia, muscles and skin to bone. The cicatrix is not skin, but a good and sufficient substitute for it.

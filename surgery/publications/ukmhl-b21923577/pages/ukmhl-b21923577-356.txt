33G GOUT. temperance and exercise. Persons must be contented to work hard, and to live moderately; they must, to use a homely phrase, "keep their eyes open, and their mouths shut." Mankind like to indulge their appetite, to lead indolent lives, and yet they wish also to have health. They want to com- bine two things that are incompatible, but they ought to be reasonable; they may have good eating and drinking with bad health, or good health with temperate fare. Our notion of gout is not to be confined to its effects on the joints; other organs and textures are liable to disorders, which originating in the same cause as the affections of the joints, are not improperly termed gout both in popular and medical language. The head, chest, or abdomen, may suffer in this way. Are these affections peculiar, that is, gouty, or of common character ? There is no peculiarity in treatment, nor in the result of examinations after death, that we should call gouty. When disease in gouty individuals occurs in internal parts, it has the same symptoms which would cha- racterise common inflammation in the same parts. There are no external signs by which we can distinguish a gouty attack in the head, chest, or abdomen, from other diseases in the same situations; and examinations after death do not enable us to distinguish such disorder from inflammation induced by other causes. The iris affords an example in a part comparatively ex- ternal, of the peculiar character of inflammation in a gouty person. It is very liable to disease in persons of such con- stitution, and the inflammation exhibits some characters which enable us to distinguish it from other inflammatory affections of the part. The iris, like the joints, may be the seat of repeat 3d attacks of inflammation in the gouty, which, although serious at the time, as in the joints, pass off without much injury to the organ : their frequent repetition, however,

DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSIC AND SURGERY. 5 result, the life of the individual. All the leading arrange- ments are calculated to give a character of unity to the organization and the living actions of our frame. There is a common source of nutrition for the whole body; a single centre of circulation; a common place of union for all sensations and volitions, for nervous energy of whatever kind. The various organs are not only intimately connected by the share which they severally take in executing associated and mutually dependent functions, they act and react on each other, often very powerfully, either through obvious connexions in structure, or by the hitherto imperfectly- known influences which we call sympathies. Hence the expression of Hippocrates, in relation to the human body, is perfectly correct, Labor unus; consentientia omnia (One exertion; all parts concurring.) You could form no adequate notion of one organ, or system of orga.ns, if you insulated it from the rest of the body, any more than you could estimate the use or action of a single wheel or lever detached from a watch or a steam-engine. As the animal machine, although complicated in structure, is single, and as its living motions, although numerous and intricate, form one indivisible series, so a similar connexion runs through those changes of structure and function, which constitute disease: hence there is one anatomy and physio- logy, and there can be only one pathology. If we wish to know any portion of the body, we must not only carefully examine the part itself, but survey the relations of structure and function which bind it to the rest; and if we investigate any class of diseases, we must consider, not only the local symptoms, but also the disturbance which the diseased organs may excite in other parts of the frame, and the influence which other parts may exert over the seat of disease.

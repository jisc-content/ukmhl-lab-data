TONGUEâ€”TREATMENT. 559 raised into irregular, prominent, convex elevations, the size of peas, with white epithelial surface, like that of the tongue ; the substance was firm. It interfered most incon- veniently with all the movements of the organ, but was not otherwise painful. Never having seen a similar case, I was in doubt respecting its nature, but believed it to be innocent, and decided on removing it by ligature. I passed a large curved needle, armed with a strong ligature, through the substance of the tongue, at the middle of the base of the growth. In order to be sure of including the whole substance, I cut a rather deep notch behind, and another in front of the disease, carrying the front and back threads along these notches respectively, and exerted my utmost strength in tying both threads. The strangulation was not quite perfect in one of the knots, but this did not interfere with the result. As the ligatures were not removed till the fifth or sixth day, the diseased part had become too much changed to admit of its structure being satisfactorily determined. The surface slowly cicatrized, the part remaining rather swollen and sore. Some weeks afterwards there was increase of swelling, with some ulceration, to which I freely applied the potassa fusa, with the desired effect of leading to a sound cicatrix and permanent cure. In the treatment of this distressing malady the principal point for consideration is the value of an operation. The diseased part may be excised completely and effectively in the early, and even in a somewhat advanced stage of the affection. The wounded surface heals readily, and in general there is no relapse in the part. If there should be a return, it may pro- bably be owing to the incision having gone too close to the disease, and thus it affords the useful caution of carrying the knife clearly beyond the extent of the mischief. With the removal of the morbid structures, and the cicatrization of the

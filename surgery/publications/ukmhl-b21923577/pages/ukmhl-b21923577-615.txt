TESTICLE. 595 eye was dark, as both looked so exactly alike. He seemed perfectly well on the evening before his death; on the follow- ing morning at breakfast he was sick and complained of excruciating pains in the head, which went on for six hours, when he expired at the age of ten years and a half. The contents of the cranium were actively congested, and a small portion of firm diseased structure was discovered on tjie inner flat surface of one cerebral hemisphere. In the early part of 1841, I saw a child from Liverpool, in consultation with the late Mr. Thomas and the late Mr. C. Guthrie. It was an unequivocal example of fungus haema- todes of the eye. The lens and iris being unaffected, I pro- posed the long-continued use of mercury in small doses. In June, 1842, I received a letter from Mr. Neill, of Liverpool, stating that " some four months ago, a smart attack of in- flammation took place in the diseased eye, which was re- duced by leeching, &c, since which time a wasting away of the eyeball has been going on similar to that wasting which goes on after a punctured wound in the neighbourhood of the eye, and the eyeball is now a mere yellow shining morsel, not a fourth of the natural size. The other eye is showing symptoms of disorganizing inflammation also, and the vision is becoming very indistinct. The pupil does not dilate by the use of belladonna, the iris is puckered round the edge, and the eye has the appearance as if the posterior humours pushed the iris against the cornea, as is often seen in glaucoma."

ACTION OP MERCURY. 369 on which we place reliance for arresting and curing syphilis; and I believe it may properly be regarded in that light. It is not, however, au essential evidence on the point. Action on the mouth is not seen in some persons, though the other effects of the remedy, including its influence on the disease may go on satisfactorily. When, therefore, the symptoms are giving way, the mercury need not be pushed because the mouth remains unaffected. Mercury cures syphilis in infants, though the mouth does not become sore. Action of the remedy.â€”I have already spoken of mercury as a purgative and an alterative. It does not cure syphilis when thus used. Its purgative action, indeed, interferes with or prevents that constitutional influence on which we depend for the cure of the disease, and must therefore be arrested by the combination of opium with the mercurial. At the same time that the effects just described are pro- duced, a salutary influence is exerted over the syphilitic symptoms in most, but not in all cases. Ulcers, losing the ulcerative character, cease to spread. The reproductive pro- cess commences, and healing is soon completed. Lymph is absorbed from the iris. Matter is sometimes removed from a suppurated bubo. Eruptions fade and disappear. Swellings of the periosteum are dispersed. Pains of joints and limbs cease. These various effects seem hardly reducible to any one principle, for, prima facie, they are in some respects contra- dictory. There is increased activity of absorption/by which lymph is removed from the iris, a periosteal or a glandular swelling is dispersed, or matter is taken up from a bubo On the other hand, the process of destruction is stopped, and deposition of new matter takes place in ulcers. The contra- diction, however, is only apparent, not real. The general effect of mercury is to arrest the venereal inflammation; this is the same in all the cases, while the absorption in the first 24

SECONDARY SYMPTOMS. 433 dolent state, they may be touched with the nitrate of silver from time to time. After a regular outbreak in the throat and skin, a relapse may occur, 'sooner or later, and require renewal of the treatment. Sometimes very slight return of eruption or ulceration may take place after a longer or shorter interval, not requiring resort to mercury; warm baths and general care are sufficient, with caustic to ulcers. The use of mercury is not applicable to the serious pha- gedenic affections of the pharynx and fauces, with the phage- denic rupial sores which often accompany them. Here iodide of potassium, sarsaparilla and opium, with such fluid nourish- ment and stimuli as can be swallowed most easily, are the best remedies. Local remedies are of little avail in a state of throat in which the very attempt at gargling would be injurious. Heretofore I have frequently employed cinnabar fumigation in these throats, with beneficial influence on the morbid surface; but the process is irritating and painful, and not free from danger; I have seen acute and fatal bronchitis excited by it. The local symptoms improve under the general treatment, with merely such washing of the mouth by wine and water^ for example, as may conduce to comfort. I am well aware that the influence of mercury on the system is capable of checking phagedenic ulceration, and that it may be used ad- vantageously for rupial sores, when they appear early, and the patient's strength is unimpaired. Cinnabar fumigation of the throat has sometimes brought on salivation, under which phagedenic ulceration, both in the throat and skin, has been arrested and soon cured. This form of disease recurs fre quently, and gives way to the iodide of potassium, which has the advantage over mercury of not injuring the constitu- tion, however long or frequently it may be used. The local use of mercury in phagedena is not liable to the 28

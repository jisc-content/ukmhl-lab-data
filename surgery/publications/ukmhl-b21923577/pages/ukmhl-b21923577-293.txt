DISSECTION WOUNDS. 273 of its safety, a doubt might arise whether the poison or the remedy would he the most dangerous to life. The sting of an insect, such as the bee, wasp, or hornet, is a minute puncture, with the introduction of an acrid fluid. A small, firm, inflammatory tumour of the skin is quickly produced, with a more general and sometimes considerable swelling around, and a peculiar stinging and smarting pain. The local effects and the suffering are the most considerable from the sting of the hornet, two, three, or four of which might cause constitutional disturbance of somewhat alarming though not really dangerous character. From the multiplied stings of bees, death has been known to ensue within a short time. A French gentleman having been unlucky enough to overturn a beehive, was immediately attacked and covered by the disturbed insects. He became pale and cold, the pulse sunk, the breathing was interrupted; he felt that he was going, and death took place in less than fifteen minutes. ('Archives Generales/ v. 15.) The statements respecting the poison of the tarantula spider are fabulous. Fleas, bugs, gnats (musquitoes), scorpions, simply bite, being often painfully annoying, but not dangerous. They come generally under domestic treatment. Injuries received in dissection have generally been placed under the head of poisoned wounds, though doubts have been entertained respecting the propriety of the arrangement, that is, whether any poison is introduced into the body through these wounds or not. There are arguments on both sides of the question, which has no practical importance, as treatment does not depend on the nature of the cause, but on the character of the local and general disturbance in each case. The original injury in these cases is trivial, a superficial and small cut, a scratch, a needle puncture, in sewing up a body. Similar effects not unfrequently ensue from the like 18

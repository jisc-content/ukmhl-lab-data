CAUTEEIES. 289 practitioners. The hot iron is used in two degrees of heat, the highest or white, a lower or red heat. The former destroys instantaneously, and is said to give less pain than the latter. As its necessary proximity in action to the surround- ing parts would injure them, they should be protected by some layers of wetted paper, in which a hole is cut to expose the part requiring the cautery. The red heat will often suffice; and its transient application in this degree will some- times enable us to accomplish, in an easy manner, effective but extremely superficial disorganization. An infant under eight weeks of age had one side of the face and lower jaw, with part of the ear, covered by a thin nsevus, which had spread to this extent from a small spot observed near the nose soon after birth. It was confined to the skin, not forming one mass, but in separate portions, scattered irregularly over the space mentioned, and communicating by vascular ramifica- tions. It was completely destroyed by a red iron passed quickly over the principal portions, and leaving light-brown marks behind. I saw the child a few years after, and should hardly have known that anything had been done to the face if I had not been reminded of it. Cases of nsevus are not unfre- quent in which this method might be resorted to with advan- tage. An anaesthetic might be employed if this powerful mode of revulsion were objected to simply from the dread of pain. A more frequent form of actual cautery is the moxa, a treatment imitated from the Chinese, who use the downy substance derived from an Artemisia, compressed and formed into cones, which are placed on the part, lighted at the apex, and allowed to burn out on the skin. We employ cotton dipped in solution of nitre; when dried, it is compressed so as to form cylinders about an inch in length and from half an inch to an inch in diameter, kept in their proper form by a bit of linen or calico, of which the ends are sewn together, 19

50 INFLAMMATION, natural outlet, becomes tranquillised, the nervous system recovers, and the appetite returns. Such are the several phenomena, local and general, of a well-marked attack of inflammation, and you see there is a correspondence of character between the two. To an inquiry in what inflammation consists, it would not be sufficient to enumerate the local symptoms, the swelling, redness, heat, pain and impaired function. These are symptoms of inflammation, external signs by which we know that inflammation exists, but the real question is what are the changes in the part of which these symptoms are the ex- ternal evidences? There is disturbance of the circulation, as consequences of which, when it has proceeded to a certain extent, nutrition and secretion are altered, impaired, or suspended. Can we as yet explain how these effects are produced? It is clear, from circumstances, that an increased quantity of blood enters and circulates through the inflamed part. The increased fulness and throbbing of the arteries, the visible dis- tension of the venous trunks, the enlargement of the small vessels, as shown by the redness of the part, and the general redness throughout the tissues on examination after death satisfactorily prove that there is an increased quantity of blood sent to the part. All the textures of the inflamed member seem to contain a greater quantity of blood-vessels, and these appear to be of greater size than natural. That they are actually enlarged was shown by Mr. Hunter, in his experi- ment on the ear of a rabbit. He produced inflammation » one ear; after it was fully developed, he killed the animal, injecting the head, and clearly found that the vessels of the inflamed ear were much larger and more numerous than those of the sound one. He has given, in his work on «In- flammation and the Blood/ an engraving of the two ears,

66' INFLAMMATION, phenomena are fully developed : this is followed by decline and disappearance. Though bearing one name throughout, the disturbance is different at these several times. If an inflammation be divided into three stages, the first two, viz the origin or formation, and the stationary period, do not differ much in duration 3 but the third, that of decbne, may be very various in length. If the inflammation have been violent, and allowed to proceed uncontrolled, if the exciting causes are still acting, and the patient is guilty of excess and imprudence, the disorder may be protracted almost indefinitely; at all events, a long period intervenes be- tween the cessation of violent disturbance and recovery. This is called the chronic stage of an inflammation. Some entertain the notion that these are essentially dif- ferent, that increased action is the essence of one, debility of the other. That there is no essential difference between the acute and chronic stages of the same inflammation, appears from the change of one into the other. Acute gradually changes into chronic, chronic often relapses into acute. The two stages often require different and almost opposite treatment. Hence, perhaps, the notion of their different nature. The terms active and passive inflammation convey no clear meaning. Inflammation may occur in a weakened or un- healthy frame and thus important modifications of treatment, both local and general, may become necessary. We must distinguish between the nature of the local disturbance and the state of the constitution. As the capillaries are an inextricable network, how can we determine whether vascular disturbance is confined to oue or the other order of vessels, so as to justify the expressions arterial and venous congestion ?

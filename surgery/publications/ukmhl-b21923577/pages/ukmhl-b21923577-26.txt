0 INTRODUCTION. It must be the first duty of the medical student to learn the structure of the body and its living actions; that is, to study man in the state of health. These are the objects of the two sciences which are denominated anatomy and physi- ology. He then proceeds to the observation of diseases; he notices the circumstances under which they arise; he watches their progress and termination; he explores the organic changes which they produce, and learns to connect these changes with their appropriate external signs or symptoms during life; deriving from these comparisons the means of distinguishing the exact seat of disease, and predicting its course and event. These are the subjects of pathology, or the doctrine of disease. The student is now prepared to apply the external influences, such as diet, climate, exercise, the outward or inward remedies, or the surgical operations which may be necessary for the removal of disease and the res- toration of health. When disease is studied in this manner, in reference to the whole body, it constitutes the science of general pathology; as a similar investigation, dn-ected to any single organ, is the pathology of that part. The real question respecting the distinction of physic and surgery is this : after surveying the whole field of disease m the way just mentioned, canyon find out any portions in- sulated from the rest ? any division not connected with other parts, which can be understood without reference to them . Can you separate this entire subject of disease into two in- dependent halves, requiring different modes of study and practice? Certainly not. The entire structure and functions are universally and intimately connected. No part is inde- pendent. The causes that constitute disease are commonly to be found, not in the part itself, but in other quarter,, and the principal means of cure are seldom to be applied di- rectly to the part diseased. For instance, a person is suddenly

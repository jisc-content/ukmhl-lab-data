SUPPURATION. 158 a great object to relieve the patient. The matter does not advance to the surface; it may extend along the tendons of the fingers to the palm and back of the hand, and do great mischief. We must open, although not certain that matter may have formed, and open freely. It is of no consequence if pus should not be evacuated, as the puncture will bleed freely and thus give relief. 4. Suppurations interfering with parts essential to life, or exercising important functions, such as the larynx, pharynx, oesophagus, and the throat generally. 5. Abscesses in the neighbourhood of serous cavities, or large joints. In the former case, matter may make its way into the cavity, although it is generally discharged externally. 6. Suppurations caused by the introduction into the cel- lular membrane of irritating matters, such as urine or fasces. Here the freest incisions are necessary to limit the mischief, which would otherwise extend indefinitely. 7. To prevent the deformity consequent on extensive sup- puration in the eyelids and other parts of the face. In following up the rule now laid down, of adopting early puncture in many abscesses, we must often make the attempt in doubtful cases, where there is no decided fluctuation. The quantity of matter may be so small, in addition to its being deeply seated, that fluctuation is not to be expected. Here you must consider the origin and progress of the complaint, and the present symptoms, especially the state of the part in respect to swelling, redness, heat, and pain. Serous infiltra- tion of the surrounding textures sometimes helps our judg- ment by affording an indication of suppuration. In such doubtful cases of deep-seated suppuration it is necessary to puncture deeply; and you must therefore take care to avoid blood-vessels or other important parts; this pre- caution is especially necessary in the neck.

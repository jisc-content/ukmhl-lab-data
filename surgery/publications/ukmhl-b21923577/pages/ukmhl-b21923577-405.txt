PRIMARY SORES. 385 the part, which was bright red; there was a large foul sore on it, which was excessively painful. He said that he had suffered much in coming to town : that he had begun to take mercury as soon as I wrote, but it had not acted on the system; he thought, however, that the progress of the sore had been checked, but he had been annoyed on the journey by another cause, namely, an attack of piles, which came on just before he left the country, and had been very painful in the coach. As he had never had piles before, I thought it strange that they should appear just at that time; but he said he was sure of the fact, because he had showed them to a surgeon, who had put caustic upon them, which had made them much more painful. On examination I found he was suffering from the excoriated and ulcerated chaps round the anus, rhagades ani, a secondary consequence of the primary sore. I enjoined confinement to the house, and an active mercurial course. The remedy took effect rapidly, and as soon as the system was affected, the sores in both situ- ations were checked. By perseverance in this treatment, in two or three weeks he got well, and went back to the country. I saw another gentleman who had attended a low woman in her confinement. He had a broken surface of some kind upon the finger, which became infected; it put on a thick margin, and had an unhealthy secretion : in a short time he had a swelling of the glands in the axilla, and a scaly eruption about the body. These got well when the system was tho- roughly affected with mercury. Thus we see that syphilis may be contracted in other ways as well as through the sexual organs, and it is of consequence for those who have to practise on patients who may labour under syphilitic disease, and have to handle the organs of generation, to take great care that they do not aUow anyfcscharge to come in contact with recent wounds or ulcers. 25

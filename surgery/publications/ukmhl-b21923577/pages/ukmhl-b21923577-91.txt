ITS CAUSES. 71 Symptomatic inflammations are those caused by previous disease of another part; such as inflammation of absorbents and glands from syphilis or other local disorders, affection of the testicle in gonorrhoea; or they are local inflammations produced by general affection of the constitution. Here the inflammation is a symptom of the disease; in accidental cases the inflammation is the disease. The pustules of small- pox, the efflorescence of scarlatina and measles, and secondary syphilis, are examples. In spontaneous inflammations there is no obvious exciting cause j while in some the origin is quite obscure, as in in- fluenza, and cholera. In many inflammations, both external and internal, acute and chronic, we can trace no injurious agency on the part; but we find an unhealthy state of constitution; we refer the local disease to this cause, and we accomplish the cure by rectifying the constitutional indisposition. These states of health are brought on slowly; the individual does not con- sider himself ill; he is suddenly attacked with disease, but does not refer it to the constitutional cause; he ascribes it to some particular occurrence, to having been chilled or heated, to going from a hot room into cold air, or vice versa, to something eaten or drunk. These inflammations, owing their origin to a morbid state of constitution, are thus allied to the preceding division or the symptomatic. The local complaint is in some sort the offspring or symptom of the general affection. These unhealthy states of constitution give a predisposition to inflammation generally; they render the body susceptible of external agencies, which otherwise would not affect it, and they aggravate the inflammatory dis- turbance consequent on the action of direct exciting causes. Gouty inflammations might be classed under either divi- sion.

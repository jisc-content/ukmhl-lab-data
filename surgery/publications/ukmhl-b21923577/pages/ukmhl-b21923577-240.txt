220 MORTIFICATION. the mortification stops, and the line of demarcation between the dead and living parts occurs, the patient surely dies; for this mortification does not become limited. In deciding on this point, we have to consider, not only the state of the part, but also that of the constitution. In an un- healthy habit a slight injury may cause traumatic gangrene, which is owing in such a case to the badness of constitution rather than to the local mischief. Such a constitution would form one of the most cogent reasons against the operation. On one occasion I saw a stout man of large frame, em- ployed as a drayman in the brewery of Messrs. Whitbread. A few days previously he had grazed the shin, and regarding the hurt as of no consequence he had continued at work, when violent inflammation came on, and in about three days mortification had nearly reached the trunk. In an individual in whom so serious an effect could be produced from so slight a cause, amputation would be out of the question. I was once sent for to see a gentleman without being aware of the nature of the case that I should have to witness, and on entering the room I was much surprised with the look of the patient. He began to speak, but he appeared as though he could hardly articulate. I put my finger on his pulse, and found it sinking. The hand was cold, and I then found he had an affection of the other arm, which I was desired to look at, and when it was opened, to my great astonishment, I found the forearm mortified. It was cold, livid, and discoloured, and the process of mortification was extending up the arm. On inquiring what had occurred in this case, I found that the patient was not aware of any other cause except that a person passing him in the stm t had accidentally struck him upon the elbow a few days

192 ULCERATION. inflammation runs high, partial sloughing may occur, and the destructive process goes on rapidly. Perhaps vessels of some size are opened, and copious bleeding may ensue. Inflamed sores do not secrete pus, but yield instead of it a copious, thin, generally offensive fluid, or a thin matter of reddish colour from admixture of blood, or a thick, dark- coloured glutinous substance ; these morbid discharges being named respectively, ichor, sanies, and sordes. This state of the part, which is brought on by neglect, even total want of care, and intemperance, and probably aggravated by violent or long-continued exertion, is attended with severe pain, want of rest, and general feverish disturbance. Relief will be afforded by rest, soothing local applications, such as fomentations and poultices, of which that of bread with charcoal is the best, and a dose of Dover's powder or some other opiate at bed-time. Mild stimuli will generally be necessary, as the subjects of such an attack are usually free livers, with such fluid nourishment as the stomach will receive when more solid nutriment cannot be borne. In cases of less serious character, with inflammation of the surrounding parts, the granulations are converted into a dirty greenish or livid mass, with specks of matter and blood, and thin offensive discharge. The effects of rest and mild local treatment will often suffice, where the state of inflammation has been brought on simply by imprudent exertion. The healing of ulcers is often retarded by inflammation, although its presence is not indicated by the obvious and striking circumstances just enumerated, especially m young persons, those of full habit, and such as are accustomed to free living. There is swelling of the part, redness of skin, some heat, and pain. Sometimes such a state comes on during the healing of a large ulcer, especially if the patient

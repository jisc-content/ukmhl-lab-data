423 SORB-THROAT. out swelling or pain. I have found it in patients who had said, when asked on the subject, that they had no sore throat. There may be inflammation of the mucous membrane of the fauces, with redness, thickening, and pain, especially in swallowing. There may be ulceration in various forms, superficial or a little deeper, with slight loss of substance, yellowish or whitish surface, frequently with painful enlai'ge- ment of the cervical glands.

It has an irregular, foul, tawny, grayish, or yellowish surface, with a ragged edge, red and swelled margin. It often spreads to a great size, passing upwards, behind the velum, and down- wards further than we can follow it. Sometimes it passes to the upper surface of the velum. There is severe pain, shooting to the ears, and thus showing that the expanded orifices of the Eustachian tubes are involved in the mischief. Deglutition is only accomplished with the greatest difficulty and suffering, and even articulation is painful. When the upper surface of the velum and the pharynx suffer together, the surfaces become firmly and permanently united by inoscu- lation of the granulations. A small opening at the centre keeps up the communication between the posterior, nares and the pharynx. Syphilitic affection of the tongue is of frequent occurrence, either in conjunction with disease in the throat or indepen- dently. The mucous membrane, with its epithelial covering is the part affected in the great majority of instances In conjunchon with scaly eruption, the membrane may bo

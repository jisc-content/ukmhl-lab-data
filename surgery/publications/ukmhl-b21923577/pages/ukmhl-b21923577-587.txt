SCROTUM. 567 The disease of the scrotum, peculiar to chimney-sweeps, not to the boys who used to climb the chimneys, but to the adults, whose occupation keeps them constantly more or less covered with soot, belougs to the epithelial class in all its leading features. It begins with an elevation of some kind, called in the trade soot-wart, and spreads around with thick- ening, swelling, and some induration, the surface being uneven, and roughened, or throwing out warty irregularities, with a broken surface. It involves the cellular tissue of the scrotum, and thus may present a more or less considerable mass of disease. In course of time it ulcerates, the sore being sometimes superficial, but irregular and painful; or there may be an ulcerative excavation with raised and thickened edge. It may go on to convert the entire integument and cellular tissue of the scrotum into one thickened and hardened mass, closely surrounding and embracing one or both testicles, which are simply included, but not changed in structure. The disease is accompanied throughout with a characteristic dis- charge of most offensive and disgusting odour. The absor- bent glands in the groin are affected sooner or later, and go through the same course as those of the jaw and neck in cancers of the tongue and lip. Effectual excision is the only remedy for this serious disease. If it is performed freely at an early period, including the testicle if it should be involved in the disease, and if exposure to the exciting cause should be discontinued, a permanent cure may be confidently expected. I removed the entire scrotum with both testicles in one case, and saw the patient alive and well at the end of thirty years. If the absorbent glands should have become recently affected, so that it may be doubted whether they are merely enlarged or changed in structure, it may be advisable to give the patient the chance of the operation, as the glan- dular swelling has been known to disappear after the removal

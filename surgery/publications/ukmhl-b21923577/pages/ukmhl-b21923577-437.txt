AFFECTIONS OF THE SKIN. 417 syphilis. A portion, sometimes circular, sometimes of irre- gular figure, slowly inflames, becomes red, thickened, indu- rated and irregular on the surface. Ulceration ensues, usually going deeply, with foul surface. There may be a large slough, or some smaller ones, leaving foul sores. Occasionally a circular piece of skin is destroyed in its whole thickness, leaving a deep ulcer, as if a piece had been taken out by a punch. When the ulcers have healed, the skin remains rough, red, and sometimes tuberculated; occasionally ulce- rating, if neglected, and possibly lasting a considerable time. The larger excavated sores remaining after a deep slough are extremely painful in the whole course of the complaint, and demand careful treatment both, local and general.

It may be attended with considerable uneasiness, especially in sitting, and patients often refer their suffering to piles. The old name of rhagades digitorum is applied to a peculiar and painful ulceration of the toes, affecting their intervals and opposed surfaces, of which the cuticle becomes thickened and opaque, while the cutis is partially livid, yielding a thin brownish, and very offensive discharge. It may affect one or two internals or the whole series.

MODE OF STUDY. 17 attentively observed, will teach you more than any lectures or books. If you attend to nature with an unprejudiced mind, you cannot go astray. Lecturers and writers often copy from each other without resorting to the fountain of knowledge : can we wonder that they frequently mislead and deceive instead of instructing; ?

Internal diseases, and ;he more general affections, which together make up the lepartment of the physician, form a very arduous and im- portant branch of study, which will require much time and ;he closest attention. The obscure nature of inward disease â€¢enders its investigation more difficult than that of outward iffections. You will, therefore, embrace every opportunity )f studying this subject practically, as well as by lectures and >ooks.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSIC AND SUEGEEY. 3 are taught by distinct teachers, in separate courses of in- struction; and their regulation is intrusted-by law to two distinct public bodies, the Colleges of Physicians and Sur- geons. Viewing these apparent contradictions, we are natu- rally led to inquire more narrowly in what the distinction between physic and surgery consists, whether in the nature of the diseases allotted to each, or in the mode of treatment; whether there is any essential difference in the mode of learn- ing them ? how and when the distinction arose ? whether it is well founded ? whether it tends to the advantage of the public, or merely to the benefit of physicians and surgeons ?

Certain branches of practice were followed separately in Egypt, where the diseases of the eyes, of the teeth, and even of some internal parts, were attended to exclusively by particular classes of practitioners; and some such distinctions existed in Rome; but Hippocrates, Galen, Celsus, and the other medical writers of antiquity, treat indifferently of the nature and management of fevers, injuries, external and internal disorders, and operations. In speaking of treatment, Celsus considers it under three divisions, the same which we still adopt, and mentions these under their Greek names; viz., (diet, &c), ^apuaKBfiriKt, (reme- dies), xÂ«pty>yunj (chirurgical, or manual proceedings). But the idea of splitting medicine into two parts, and of teaching them differently, seems never to have been entertained by this elegant and philosophic writer, nor by those other founders and great promoters of medical science and practice, whose names and works are still regarded with deference and respect In the long night of barbarism and ignorance, which intervened between the downfall of the Roman Empire and the revival of letters in the West of Europe, learning and

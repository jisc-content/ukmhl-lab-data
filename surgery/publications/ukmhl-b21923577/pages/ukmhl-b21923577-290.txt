270 POISONED WOUNDS. VENOMOUS SERPENTS. The bite of these animals is more immediately serious and alarming, both in its local and general influence, than that of those affected with rabies, though the constitutional disorder, however dangerous, is not invariably fatal like the general excitement of hydrophobia. While the poison in the latter case remains dormant for weeks or months, the local effect in the former is immediate, and quickly rises to its highest intensity, the constitutional disturbance proceeding and increasing at the same time. This course is essentially ne- cessary to the accomplishment of the object for which the poisonous property exists, that of disabling the animals which form the prey of these serpents. The venom is secreted in a small gland situated near the articulation of the lower jaw on each side of the head, and furnished with a duct which opens into a small canal hollowed out in the poison-fang. This is a small, smooth, and per- fectly sharp-pointed tooth, admirably adapted to perform a species of inoculation, introducing and lodging safely at a suitable depth a minute portion of the venom by a sudden sharp stroke of the head. In non-venomous serpents there are four longitudinal rows of small, sharp-pointed, upper teeth, ranged from before backwards, two of them on the palate, the two others on the sides of the upper jaw. In the venomous species the lateral rows are wanting, and in lieu of them there is a poison-fang at each anterior corner of the mouth. Some of the more dangerous kinds are popularly known, such as the rattlesnake of North America (Crotalus) of which the bite will kill a cat or puppy in a few minutes. It may be fatal, but is not always so to man, or even to animals.

Mortification is the death of a part, with a peculiar change in its state, the result of a preceding peculiar disorder; hence (that is, in the previous peculiar disorder) it is distinguished fromâ€” 1.

This is local asphyxia, that is, cessation of pulsation or circulation, which bears the same relation to local death as suspended animation or general asphyxia does to general death. 3. Chemical decomposition, or the changes produced in living parts by the application of heat, acids, alkalies, and other chemical agents. These are chemical phenomena; mortification is the result of vital changes. 4. Putrefaction, or chemical decomposition consequent on death, that is, alteration of animal structures from the effect of surrounding influences after death. This also is chemical not vital change. Putrefaction often follows mortification, but not necessarily the pecuhar change constituting mortification is in some

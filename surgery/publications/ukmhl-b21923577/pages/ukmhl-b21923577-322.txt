ou<* TETANUS. Symptoms and course of the disease.â€”The muscles first affected are those of the jaw, face, and deglutition. There is stiffness of these parts, soon passing into more or less complete rigidity. The two rows of teeth are either held close together, or separable only in a slight degree. There is a peculiar fixed and characteristic expression of coun- tenance, caused by the involuntary action of the muscles on the moveable parts of the face, altogether at variance with the state and feelings of the patient, and hence called risus sardonicus. This facial spasm, together with that of the masseter and temporal muscles, keeps the mouth closed. Swallowing is difficult, and occasionally hardly practicable for a time. The back of the neck soon becomes rigid. A peculiar sensation is experienced behind the ensiform car- tilage, from which pain shoots to the back. This is nearly, if not always, present. The muscles of the spine and those of the abdomen then become rigid; the walls of the latter are as hard as a board, while the head and spine are so forcibly bent backwards that the body rests in the recumbent position on the occiput and pelvis. Lastly, the affection involves the limbs, so as now to include the whole voluntary muscular system, with the addition of the diaphragm, if the pain behind the ensiform cartilage depends on the state of that muscle. The disease seems to destroy life by exhaustion of the nervous power, but it may be suddenly fatal by spasm of the larynx or the heart. The state of the affected muscles is generally that of con- traction and rigidity, but convulsions or movements of violent and irregular character are brought on by slight causes, and are of the most painful kind. You can estimate this suffering by knowing the pain of cramp in the calf of the leg, which lasts only for a few seconds, and supposing this to affect the whole frame, and to be continued. The state of rigidity is attended

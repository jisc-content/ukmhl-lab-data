594 FUNGUS H7EMAT0DES. of the deposit distends the eye and disturbs its circulation, soon causing opacity of the lens, and pushing the iris against the cornea. The circumstance could not be more favour- able to the complete removal of malignant disease in its earliest stage. This has been repeatedly done with uniform failure by return of disease in the part, and ultimate fatal termination. The hope of benefit from an operation being thus entirely abandoned, we anxiously inquire whether a chance of relief can be discerned from any other source. There is some evidence that the employment of mercury in an early stage of the disease, probably before the crystalline lens and iris have suffered in any way, may sometimes check the complaint, and even lead to what may be called a temporary cure. I was consulted in the case of a boy sis years of age, in good health, in whom the disease had been accidentally dis- covered by the metallic reflexion in the pupil; the eye ap- peared healthy in all other respects, but vision was lost, which had not been observed previously. I ordered the gray powder two or three times daily, in doses of two or three grains, pushing the remedy as far as could be done with safety to health. The lens soon became opaque, and the iris was a little pushed forward. The disease, instead of increasing, became quiet, the lens was slowly absorbed, and an opaque capsule remained behind the pupil, effectually concealing the interior of the globe. The general ap- pearance of the organ was not altered. The health re- mained good for ia year or two from the first notice of the disease. He then had a serious illness, attended with pain in the head, and considered by the attendant physician to be water in the head. From this he recovered, and remained tolerably well for nearly two years. The physician remarked that he looked remarkably well, and actually inquired which

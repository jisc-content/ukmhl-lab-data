Ulcers of the legs are the most numerous, and most diffi- cult of management, especially in tall persons, and those in bad health. The restorative process is influenced by the degree of general power and the state of health, while, reciprocally, the condition of a sore will affect the constitution. The super- vention of fever stops the progress of repair; granulations disappear and ulceration is renewed. If hospital gangrene attacks a healing sore, a powerful depressing influence quickly pervades the frame. Hence an ulcer is a good index of the individual's health. A healthy ulcer is one in which the restorative processes are going on favorably, and the person is in good health. The newly deposited substance is firm, the granulations are small and pointed, not rising above the edge of the sore; they are of a florid red, as if from the presence of arterial blood in the capillaries. Yet even here the colour will depend on the position of the part, the florid tint being changed to a darker and even somewhat livid hue on holding down the limb, and a few drops of blood may even escape. The pus is thick, whitish, and moderate in quantity. No additional remarks on treatment are required, except that confinement is neither necessary nor advantageous.

The granulations are large, pale, flabby or spongy, rising above the edge of the sore; there is copious secretion of thin matter. The limb swells, more particularly in the dependent posture.

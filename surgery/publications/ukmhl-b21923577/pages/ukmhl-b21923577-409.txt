PRIMARY SORES. 389 of the prepuce are involved in a common sore, the latter will be indurated, but not the former. The great respect, amounting almost to veneration, in which the authority of Mr. Hunter has always been held, especially in reference to a subject on which he had bestowed much thought, has led to the general adoption of his views respecting the primary venereal sore or chancre, as he always calls it, and succeeding writers and teachers have generally adopted his description, instead of examining for themselves.

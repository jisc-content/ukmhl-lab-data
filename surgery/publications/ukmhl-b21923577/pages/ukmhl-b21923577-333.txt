CHAPTER XV. SPECIFIC DISEASES. SCROFULA. We use this term in two senses, either to designate the peculiar characters which distinguish a certain class of diseases, or to indicate the peculiarity of constitution which is generally original or connate, from which such peculiar character is derived. In the former sense, scrofula is equivalent to scrofulous disease, in the latter to scrofulous constitution. Thus, if we say of a person that he has scro- fula, we mean that he labours under some actual disease of scrofulous character. When it is said that scrofula exists in a family, the meaning is that individuals of the family in greater or smaller number, exhibit that original peculiarity or defect of constitution which is called scrofulous, although none of them may be suffering from disease at the time. The word scrofula is said to be derived from scrofa, which is the Latin for a sow; though the ground for the deriva- tion is not apparent. The term struma, properly applied to swellings of the neck, is often used as equivalent to scrofula. Popularly, these diseases are often denominated the evil, or the king's evil, from the belief entertained in former times that the touch of a royal personage would cure them.

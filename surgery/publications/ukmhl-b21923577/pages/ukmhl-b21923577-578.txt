558 EPITHELIAL CANCER. edges are sometimes thickened, moderately indurated, and raised. The morbid change in cancer gradually extends to surrounding parts, so that in the advanced stage the tongue is not only indurated but almost fixed. In a patient under my care in this hospital, the ulceration extended from the edge of the tongue to the tonsil, and fatal haemorrhage took place from the artery of the tonsil laid open in the progress of the ulceration. In examining this case after death, morbid change was found to have extended through the whole thickness of the organ, which we had not been aware of during life, for the question of extirpation had been en- tertained not very long before the patient's death. The pain of cancerous ulceration is most severe, and aggravated by exertion of the organ in articulation, mastication, and swal- lowing. The aid of opium is absolutely necessary for pro- curing temporary ease. In syphilitic cases, the uneasiness is comparatively inconsiderable. The absorbent glands be- come enlarged and indurated in cancer; they do not suffer in syphilitic cases, or, if they do, it is from simple irritation. I once saw a considerable excrescence on the side of the tongue of formidable appearance, which might have been supposed, as indeed it had been, to be of malignant cha- racter. It was in a gentleman of forty-two, stout, and of full habit, who had been accustomed for a long course of years to eat and drink freely. He had a large ruddy face, hot skin, very white tongue, and full pulse. The disease had existed two years, having been considered at first to be a common wart; it had grown of late more rapidly, in spite of escharotics. The growth, situated along the left edge of the tongue, was of oval form, at least an inch and a half in the long axis, and an inch across. Its height from the surface was three quarters of an inch. It was attached to the tongue by its whole breadth. The surface was not ulcerated, but

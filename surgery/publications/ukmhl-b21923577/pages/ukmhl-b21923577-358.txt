RHEUMATISM. 338 ditiori of the digestive organs and nutritive function, are produced by the deposition in and around the joints and tendinous sheaths of urate of soda, a whitish friable substance with a loose resemblance to chalk, and hence popularly called chalk stone. Tbe pupil of the lost eye was nearly closed, and the capsule of the lens was opaque.

Whenever he had any warning symptoms, he took a few doses of this medicine, which effectually pre- vented the attack.

As in the case of other affections nearly resembling each other, these run together, so that we sometimes hesitate in determining which name should be given in particular cases. The term rheumatic gout, fami- liarly employed in common language, and not altogether disowned by medical men, serves to solve the difficulty. As we cannot show how persons subject to gout or rheumatism differ when the diseases are absent, from those naturally healthy, so we are unable to distinguish between the two constitutions except from the characters of the affections to

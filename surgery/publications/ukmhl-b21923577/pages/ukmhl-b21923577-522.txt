502 CANCER. At the period of these publications the two last-mentioned subjects were very imperfectly understood. As they became better known, differences so important were observed between them that they could not be included in one description without the introduction of exceptions and qualifications in such number as would make the account confused and uncer- tain. For practical purposes, therefore, I think it better to consider the subjects separately, in which plan they will pro- bably be most intelligible to the student. I am aware that my colleague, Mr. Paget, who has studied profoundly the pathological relations of these diseases, having brought to bear on the subject an immense amount of direct observation and examination, with knowledge of all that has been done by other inquirers, has considered it best to throw all the malignant diseases into one group, under the generic name of cancer, which would include several species, perhaps exhi- biting further distinctions as varieties. They who wish for full information will resort to Mr. Paget's lectures, in which they will find a lucid exposition of all that is known on the subject. . Cancer, carcinoma, scirrhous or hard cancer, is a peculiar morbid change of structure in a part, of which induration is the most striking external character. In its primary form at least, it is not seen as an adventitious production, that is a new and separate formation or tumour, but always as a disorganization of some part, often so complete that traces of the original form and composition can hardly be extin- guished. Thus in the scirrhous lump of the female breast the natural structure of the part has disappeared, and a morbid growth has taken its place. M. Lebert, a patient and successful inquirer, characterises the change as a substi- tution. In this respect it offers a strong contrast to fungus hsematodes, or soft cancer, which commences in the

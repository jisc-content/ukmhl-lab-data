SUPPUEATION. 145 mixed with the disorganized tissue. This breaking down of tissues, and the bloody effusion, are not mechanical, but vital processes. White matter or pus is now seen disseminated in small portions, which soon unite into one collection, an abscess. The fluid increases in quantity; the collection, as it increases, pushing aside and condensing the surrounding cellular tissue and other soft parts, which yield more or less readily according to their nature. The cellular texture gives way easily; the firmer parts, such as muscles, tendons, blood- vessels, resist, forming elevations or ridges on the sides of the abscess, and sometimes pass across from one side to the other, being insulated by the matter. "When the surrounding parts yield equally, the form of the collection is regular and rounded; under other circumstances, the figure is various. The surface of the cavity is soft and pulpy, greyish or yellowish, being coloured by the matter which adheres to it. With the handle or back of a scalpel we can scrape off a soft, greyish substance, considered to be fibrine. This is inorganic, at least it does not receive injection. When it is removed, we see a dense, compact, reddish structure which has been compared to a mucous membrane. This kind of newly-formed membranous texture constitutes a bag containing the mat- ter j it may be dissected entire from the surrounding parts, when the abscess would be a bag or cyst full of matter. This texture, recently called the pyogenic membrane, forms, in technical language, the parietes, walls, or sides of an abscess. Its internal smooth surface, which shows considerable vas- cularity on injection, is in contact with the contained matter.>: To the external surface the surrounding cellular membrane and other parts are closely adherent, being condensed -and rendered preternaturally firm by the inflammatory profess. This condensation extends to a greater or less distance around 10

16 INTRODUCTION. Between him who has only read or heard, and one who has seen, there is the same difference, in point of knowledge, as between a person who has merely perused the description of foreign countries, and another who has actually visited them. To secure these advantages to their full extent, instruction should be strictly clinical, that is, the symptoms of disease, and the changes it produces, should be actually pointed out and explained on the patient; their origin, progress, and connexion, should be illustrated, and the indications and modes of treatment should be deduced from the facts thus immediately observed. This kind of clinical instruction can only be given at the time of visit. I have always endeavoured to explain diseases in this manner to the pupils of the hospital, and I shall continue to illustrate clinically in the wards the general doctrines which I deliver in this theatre. ' After beginning to observe diseases for yourselves, you may have recourse, with advantage, to lectures and books, which may be of great use in teaching you how and what to observe; in pointing out what might escape observation ; in elucidating what may be obscure and perplexing; in rectifying erroneous - conclusions; and in impressing the results of observation more strongly on the memory. I cannot help thinking that too much importance has been attached to lectures. From the long prevalent custom of attending them, and the regulations of the public bodies which require certificates of attendance, before admitting candidates to examination, the belief seems at last to have been produced, that medicine can be learned in this manner. This is a great mistake. The medical sciences rest on observation, and are only to be acquired by resorting to nature. The great number and intricacy of the phenomena are additional reasons why we should examine for ourselves, and not take the facts at second or third hand. A few cases

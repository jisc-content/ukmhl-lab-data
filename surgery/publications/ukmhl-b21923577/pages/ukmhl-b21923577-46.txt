2G THE NATURE AND tubercular degeneration. We sliould be at a loss to make an equally clear enumeration of functional affections, and thus fail in an attempt to distribute all diseases under the two- fold division of organic and functional in any clear and rational ground. Where should we place inflammations and the changes which they often leave behind. In their active state, alterations in the affected organs are obvious enough. In the great majority of cases these are transitory, so that the organs soon recover their normal structure and functions, but in other instances they leave behind more or less per- manent changes. The difference between functional and organic disease has sometimes been marked in our own language by the terms disorder and disease j but this use of the two words is neither sanctioned by their common acceptation, nor indeed by their etymological signification. In common language disorder and disease are synonymous, and used indiscriminately; and if we inquire what is their proper meaning, it seems to be nearly the same. What is disease ? It is an interruption of ease, that is, a change in feeling. What is disorder? An interruption of the regular course in which the functions should be executed. Examination after death is not a perfectly satisfactory criterion of the changes which may have taken place in an organ during life. There are obvious and important changes observable during life, which leave no trace after death. In erysipelas, there is determination of blood to the skm, with distension of the blood-vessels and increased redness; but these appearances are lost after death. In inflammation of the eye, there is external redness, which disappears after death. We cannot, therefore, conclude because we discern no change in the state of the part after death, that no change had taken place during life. Before we can determine that no change

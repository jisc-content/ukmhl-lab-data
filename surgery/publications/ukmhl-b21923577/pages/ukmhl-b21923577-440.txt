430 SECONDARY SYPHILIS, to form large masses. A vascular elevate of warty kind is sometimes seen on tie raphe of the perinamm, and has been called, not inaptly, crista galli. The immense magnitude whioh these masses are capable of acquiring could hardly he believed without the direct evrdenee of sight The most extraordinary case I have seen was that of a female under twenty-five years of age, who bad led an irre-ular life, but had suffered only from gonorrhma, she had teen married about a year, and was pregnant when admitted into St Bartholomew's under my care, in a good state ot general health.

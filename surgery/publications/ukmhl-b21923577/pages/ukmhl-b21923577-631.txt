MALIGNANT (?) DISEASE OE TONSIL. 611 appeared after the removal of a part to which not the slightest suspicion of malignant character could attach. A man, about forty-five, who had always enjoyed good health, his occupation through life having been agricultural, came into St. Bartholomew's under my care, for an enlargement of the right tonsil, presenting the usual character of hypertrophy, and obviously requiring excision, an operation which I had never performed, except on much younger subjects.

I therefore cut off as much as protruded, with the effect of remedying completely what had been complained of. The part removed was simply hypertrophied tonsil. He returned to the country, with a strict injunction to come back if any further inconvenience should be experienced. He came to the hospital again in the month of October, with a swelling as large as an egg, proceeding from the former site, and seeming to fill the pharynx, so as to produce a formidable impediment to the act of swallowing. This I removed with the ecraseur, getting the loop of the chain over the lower end of the swelling, which was at some distance below the tongue, drawing up the ends, so as to include the root of the mass, and then fixing them to the movable branches of the instrument, the action of which caused so much choking feel and involuntary efforts of the surrounding parts, that it was necessary to hasten the process, which was accom- plished almost without loss of blood.

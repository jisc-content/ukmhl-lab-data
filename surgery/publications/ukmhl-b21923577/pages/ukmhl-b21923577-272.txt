QUESTION OP AMPUTATION. incision of an amputation is advantageously substituted for an injury of so dangerous a character. If the accident has occurred so high up as not to leave room for regular amputa- tion, the wound should be made as even as possible, splinters should be removed, and the end of the bone taken off. The artery should be tied. In considering the place of amputation it is a general rule to preserve as much of the limb as you can. Remember, how- ever, that splintering of the bone often passes beyond the seat of the main injury, and thus that it might possibly be expedient to amputate above the next joint; for instance, above the knee. A more important consideration is the best time for ampu- tation. The arguments on this point are equally applicable to cases of compound fracture. We have to choose between im- mediate, or rather early amputation, that is, within ten, or at furthest twenty-four hours, before inflammation has come on in the part, and before fever has commenced, and delayed, after fever has subsided. These are called, respectively, primary and secondary. It will be understood that the former will not be resorted to so long as the state of nervous depression occasionally attendant on these injuries has not passed off. Experience has so clearly determined the point in favour of the primary operation, that the question may be considered as settled. Mr. Pott had already taken the correct view of this important question, and has strongly enforced the necessity of " immediate or very early decision.-" (f Works/ vol. iii, p. 359.) The great reason for amputation is because the injury im- mediately or remotely endangers life; that is, by mortifica- tion, inflammation, and violent fever, as its immediate or early effects, or subsequently by successive inflammation, suppura- tion, and hectic.

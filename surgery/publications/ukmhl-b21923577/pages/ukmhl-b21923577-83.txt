ITS EFFECTS AND VARIETIES. G3 condition of inflamed parts. The lung-substance consolidated by the inflammatory process breaks down easily under jjressure; the substance of the brain may be semi-fluid from the same cause. The inflamed mucous membrane of the alimentary canal may be reduced to a pulp. In inflamed parts ligatures cut through or tear away the textures. Ulceration and gangrene will be mentioned in another lecture. The more remote changes consequent on inflammatory effusions consist in opacity of parts naturally transparent, as the cornea or the arachnoid membrane; in adhesion between those naturally distinct, as in the serous cavities; in thick- ening, consolidation, and induration, white, gray, or red, the last termed hepatization â€¢ the differences depending on the number of the capillary vessels. All these differences in effect depend in great measure on difference in the degree of inflammatory disturbance, in which respect they might be arranged in the following order- Irritation, Vascular congestion, Effusion of serum, Ulceration Hemorrhage, Effusion offibrine, Suppuration, Gangrene. All inflammatory effusions are of high specific gravity, and contain a large quantity of albumen; they may also contain fibrme, pus, or blood-cells. The great chemical characteristic of inflammatory effusions, according to Mr. Simon is their excess of chloride of sodium and of phosphates. Pus says Professor Lehmann, contains three times as much chloride of sodium as the serum of the blood, and during pneumonia it has been shown by D, Beale, the lung is so disproportion- ately loaded with this salt that the urine is entirely deprived of * But in all inflammatory effusions ^00^ forms abound. Whether they first appear as tr J " nuclei, which subsequently gather around them their vesting wall, or whether they represent prating cells'

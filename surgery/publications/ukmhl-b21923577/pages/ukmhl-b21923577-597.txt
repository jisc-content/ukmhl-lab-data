FUNGUS 1LEMAT0DES. 577 disappears, its place being supplied by the morbid growth. A patient was under my care in St. Bartholomew's, about a year ago, for a considerable general enlargement of the knee, without discoloration. He was robust, with a considerable subcutaneous stratum of fat, although little more than thirty. He was in good health, and represented himself always to have been so, and had followed his usual occupations until the time of admission. The knee, though much swelled, could be moved nearly to the full extent in flexion and extension. There was a feeling of elasticity above and on each side of the patella, with an obscure and, indeed, doubtful sense of fluctuation ; there was some pain. It was concluded, though with hesitation, to be a case of synovitis. The treatment employed under that supposition was ineffectual; the swelling increased, and the pain became so considerable that the patient urgently requested the removal of the limb, under the belief that the operation was his only resource. The undefined fulness, with the sense of elasticity, the uniform enlargement over the whole anterior and lateral aspects of the knee, and the absence of all inflammatory disturbance threatening suppuration, led to the supposition that there might be considerable and extensive swelling and thickening of the synovial membrane. The operation was performed in July, 1861, about five or six weeks after his admission; the thick flaps of integument were necessarily very large from the great bulk of the limb, but the healing process went on favorably in all respects, and the cure was rapid.

A soft, medul- lary mass, of light pinkish and grayish colour, with slight marks of division on its surface, completely enveloped the internal and superior aspects of the joint. The source of this was the internal condyle and shaft of the femur to about the 37

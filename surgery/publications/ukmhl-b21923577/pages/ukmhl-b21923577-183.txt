163 CHRONIC ABSCESS. venience so slight, that he had not communicated on the subject to those about him. In September, 1828, I was consulted by a gentleman of forty, stout, and in good health, for a tumour in the neck, respecting which he had received an opinion that excision would be necessary. It had existed for two years, having formed slowly and without disturbance of health. Fluctua- tion being discovered on careful examination, I punctured, and let out three ounces of thin, light, yellowish-brown, turbid fluid. The opening closed after discharging for some time, leaving the parts apparently in as perfect a state as on the opposite side. The collection was renewed, broke, and healed after dis- charging for some time, still without pain. It reformed and required relief three or four times more at distant periods. In consequence of these collections forming without previous apparent inflammation, without heat and redness, the part retaining its natural colour and temperature, they have been called cold abscesses, abscessus frigidi, in opposi- tion to abscessus calidi, or the results of active inflammation. These cold or chronic abscesses are as different from the hot or phlegmonous in their progress as in their origin and attendant symptoms. They spread iu the circumference, without disposition to come to the surface, and thus attain a large size, going on for weeks, months, or even years. They break ultimately. In the case just related of abscess in the neck there was no appearance of tendency to breaking at the end of two years. In these cases the indolent character of chronic sup- puration is most strongly marked; there are numerous gradations between these and the phlegmonous, with occasional diversities, of which we do not always trace the reason. I saw a gentleman, between forty and fifty, on account of a

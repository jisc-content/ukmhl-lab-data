174 CHRONIC ABSCESS. are of occasional occurrence. I have seen a few examples in the female breast, and none more remarkable than that of a healthy married woman, aged thirty-four, from the country, Avho had borne three children, the last of whom she had suckled until within a few weeks of her admission into the hospital. There was a swelling, not painful nor hard, occupying nearly the external half of the right breast. It was about equal in size to a hen's egg; the integuments were loose over the entire surface, and the swelling moved easily on the subjacent parts. There was a feeling of softness on the surface, and careful examination detected fluctuation. This disease had begun more than three years previously, with a loose and painless knot, not larger than a nut. It had slowly attained its present size almost without pain. When closely questioned on the point, she said that for two or three months she had felt sometimes a slight prickling in the part, but without pain, or even uneasiness. The swelling occupied the whole thick- ness of the mammary gland, which was not large. Con- sidering the case to be cystic disease in a portion of the gland, I made an exploratory puncture with a grooved needle, along which a drop of pus escaped. More than an ounce of well- formed pus was now discharged by a free puncture, leaving the affected portion of its natural size and soft feel. The fistula? remaining after chronic abscesses, which indeed are sometimes excavations, rather than the mere pipes which the name would imply, may be treated in various ways. Compress and bandage will sometimes effect the closure; the previous injection of a strong solution of sulphate of zinc, for instance twenty grains to the ounce, may be resorted to. The astringent injection may be used alone. A seton may be placed in the tube so as to excite inflammation in its surface. In failure of such measures, it will be necessary to lay the part open by simple incision. Should the tube be

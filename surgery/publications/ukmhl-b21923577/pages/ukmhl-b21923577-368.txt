SYPHILIS. 348 mary symptom,, an inflammation proceeding generally to ulceration. The secondartj symptoms come from this source; we do not know how, any more than we know how the constitutional excitement called hydrophobia is caused by the bite of a rabid dog, or that of smallpox by inoculation, or atmospheric con- tagion. A poison is said to be introduced into or to be ex- pelled from the constitution; the system is said to be contami- nated. These somewhat figurative expressions do not denote anything capable of demonstration. There is reason to sup- pose that the blood is altered, but the alteration is not recognisable by our present means of examination. The matter secreted by primary sores is obviously in- fectious ; it is even infectious to the same individual by in- oculation. The matter of bubo is infectious. Surgeons have contracted primary sores by wounding themselves in opening buboes, or by application of the matter to existing wounds. Destruction of the eye took place in two instances by inflam- mation excited by the matter of bubo spirting into the eye of surgeons who had opened the suppurations. It is said that the secretion of secondary sores will not infect, and that it produces no effect when inoculated. I should not like to trust it in my own person. Syphilis may be communicated indirectly, thus when a pregnant woman labours under the disease in its constitutional form, the child in utero becomes diseased, generally, though not invariably. Here we must conclude that the poison is conveyed by the blood. Again, diseased infants infect healthy women by suckling, and the disease thus communicated may affect the embryo in case pregnancy should supervene. It is a question whether a woman can be infected by cohabitation with a man labouring under constitutional symptoms. The appearance of syphilis in married females is a

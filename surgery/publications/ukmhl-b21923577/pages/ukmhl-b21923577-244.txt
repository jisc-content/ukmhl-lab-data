224 MORTIFICATION. fication. Sometimes the mischief extends along the sheaths of the flexor tendons into the sole with great suffering. The constitution, at first unaffected, sympathises seriously, and the patient sinks under the extension of the mischief. This affection does not always terminate fatally. The slough of the toe or heel may separate slowly, leaving a healthy granulating and cicatrizing surface, leading to a sound cure. Thus a gentleman nearer to eighty than seventy experienced without any suffering mortification of the entire plantar surface of the last phalanx of the great toe. It healed well under confinement to bed, and there was no return of mortification during the two or three remaining years of life.

By confinement to bed for two months, to which he submitted at first very unwillingly, mild diet, and poultice, the slough separated slowly, followed by healthy and sound repair. I saw him at the end of six months in perfect health, when he felt himself better than he had been for many years. The cicatrix of the heel was covered by a hard dark crust, the foot being then as well as ever. I saw him again in good health at the end of four years from the original attack.

It healed kindly after the discharge by a free puncture of several ounces of healthy pus. Not long after mortification occurred in a toe of one foot, extending gradually but very slowly to the other toes and subsequently along the foot to the ankle, where it stopped. The dead parts separated by the natural

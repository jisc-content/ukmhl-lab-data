FEVER. 133 disease are still controverted points, even in fevers of common occurrence. Fever, taken in its original and etymological, as well as in its more obvious and common sense, as denoting the excited pulse and augmented heat, especially the latter, is the name of a symptom rather than of a disease; and it is thus em- ployed by Hippocrates, and other ancient writers, who enumerate ttvPztoq or fever among the symptoms of certain local inflammations. Regarding fever in this point of view, we might define it a general disturbance of the vascular system, caused sym- pathetically by irritation, inflammation, or disorder of some organ or parts. This, I believe, would be a sufficient definition of surgical fevers. It must, however, be observed that, if we take fever in the medical sense, and understand it to embrace, not only the cases, in which accelerated pulse and heat are present, but also others more or less closely aUied to these, we shall perhaps find some cases, at all events we shall meet with some stages of many cases, in which these symptoms are not present. It is doubtful, however, whether we can properly call any case fever, in which vascular excitement and heat are not present at some period. When an important organ is inflamed; or, when inflam- mation of serious degree and extent affects a part of less im portance, the vascular excitement and heat are conjoined wath symptoms belonging to the part, and the name some- tunes expresses both circumstances.

238 INCISED WOUNDS. respect there is no great difference between the metallic sutures and small, firm, silk threads. We are indebted to Dr. Marion Sims, of New York, for the introduction of the silver suture, which he has found peculiarly advantageous in cases of vesico-vaginal fistula and other operations in that quarter. He advocates very strongly its general employment in surgery. Sutures perhaps have been too freely employed heretofore; they have since been too much decried. The objections to them, as formerly used, are rather applicable to the mode than to the principle. The older surgeons used large needles, and large threads; they were carried deeply, with the intent of uniting the wound throughout its whole depth, and then left in indefinitely, causing inflammation and sup- puration, and often cutting their way out from the swelling of the parts. When properly employed, that is, when small needles and threads are used, and not carried deeper than the skin and adipose layer, and cut out as soon as their purpose is answered, they are sometimes necessary, often advantageous, and never hurtful. They should be used in wounds of the eyelids, eyebrows, and face generaUy, where accurate adjust- ment is necessary to prevent or lessen deformity. Small needles and silk should be used, and the threads may be cut away in twelve or twenty-four hours. I have seen unpleasant results from neglect of these simple precautions. In one case, a transverse wound through the whole thickness of the upper eyelid was allowed to cicatrize, so as to leave an opening in the lid like a button-holej in another, there was a fissure like that of bare-lip ; while in a third instance a flap of skin, in- cluding half an inch of a thick black eyebrow in its middle, torn down by an accident, was allowed to heal below the level of the rest of the brow.

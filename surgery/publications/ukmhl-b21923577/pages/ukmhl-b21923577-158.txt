He considers the abstraction of blood locally to be the most advantageous, and employs leeches to the abdomen m large numbers, often some dozens. He confines the patxent to gum water, eaagommee*. I cannot agree with either of these views. 1he loss of blood will often relieve the gastric disturbance more speecbly, effectually, and agreeably than purgatives. Under suit- able circumstances of age, strength, state of circulation, especially with a serious local affection, I should not scruple to employ venesection, although the case should be denomi- nated bilious. When the tenderness of the epigastric region is great, with tormenting thirst, and rejection of everything taken into the stomach, free leeching may be used instead of venesection or after it. We may agree with Broussais in condemning the use ot purgatives as a first or only remedy in the acute affections, to which the names of gastritis or enteritis could with any pro- priety be applied. Indeed, when the stomach immediately rejects what is swallowed, internal remedies cannot do much Jod But we cannot go further with him, and be contented, after taking blood, with the administration of gum water. Purgatives are of the greatest use in clearing away ahmentary * CWe** bilios, et saburrahs.-Sed pfa. est at •* quffi subsit materia attend eruatur : pesshnasoue sepias lata,, d necessitate, hypothetic velo ohda.it. iWciosa qo.de. - ^ > gastrica, venesectio observer, quoticscunque vera banc Lur indieatio; sed hoe ipso, quo de his loquhaur, sub «e o, hcet ca uhon, QOn ta,n iofrequens est gastric* ciun inflannnatoria dispose con.b n t o, et negto sub initio venisection irrevocabue agrotaa^us daun^ fern, experientia convicti fatemur."

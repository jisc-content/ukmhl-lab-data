SUPPURATION. 157 in the perinseum or scrotum, in the ham and groin, the axilla and the neck. Deep-seated suppuration is frequently met with on the inner surface of the lower jaw, under or hehind the bone, and in the course of the neck, the matter being formed in the abundant areolar tissue, which favours the movements almost constantly going on in the important organs occupying these situations. There is much of this tissue about the pharynx and larynx, the oesophagus and trachea, and it extends in the course of the large vessels and nerves into the chest. Matter formed in these situations, being confined by the cervical fascia, the sterno-mastoid muscle and the pla- tysma, and thus impeded in its progress outwards, presses on the organs above mentioned, and easily extends in the loose tissue around them, in which important blood-vessels and nerves abound. These circumstances render the local suffer- ing and the constitutional disturbance intense and alarming. I have seen a case of this kind in which there had been de- lirium for successive nights. As evacuation of the matter gives immediate and complete relief, it should be resorted, to as early as possible, that is, as soon as its presence can be ascertained by direct examination, or strongly presumed, from the history and present symptoms. As it may be necessary to puncture rather deeply, the position of important blood-vessels must be carefully considered before the instrument is used, and it will be better to wait than to run the risk of serious bleeding. 3. Suppurations in parts of dense and unyielding texture, such as the theca of a digital tendon, and in those which are not only dense, but copiously supplied with blood-vessels and nerves, for the inflammation of such parts is attended with severe suffering. This applies to all suppurations in and about the fingers, and most of those in the hand. They are accompanied with intense pain and fever, from which it is

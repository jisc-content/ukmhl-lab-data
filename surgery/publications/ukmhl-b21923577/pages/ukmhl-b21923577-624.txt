FUNGUS HtEMATODES. 604 mass of disease in a truly frightful state, commencing at the very back of the axilla, including the right breast, enormously enlarged, and reaching over to the sternum. Excepting the axilla, where the skin was not affected, there was not a healthy piece of integument over the rest of the bulk. The distended and thinned skin was of a dusky red throughout, except over .the central portion of the mass, where it had mortified, and now presented a large dirty gray slough, covering a quantity of semi-fluid, disorganizing struc- tures; the rest of the mass had the softness of medullary disease, and the whole was so far movable on the chest as to show that there was no firm connexion at the base. The ignorant pretender to whom this lady had entrusted her health and life for three years had represented that the abscess, as he called it, was about to break, and that she would then be well. The pulse was very feeble, the powers of life being nearly exhausted by pain, want of appetite and sleep. The alternative was clear, certain death within a week, or an operation which might prove fatal. I mentioned my will- ingness to undertake the operation, as affording the only chance of prolonging life, but without guaranteeing its safety. The operation, under the influence of chloroform, carefully administered by Mr. Coote, was performed on February 8th, 1851, the long incisions and the detachment of the mass being executed as rapidly as possible, in order to limit to the smallest amount the inevitable loss of blood; and with the same object the surface was covered with lint firmly held on as fast as it was exposed. Brandy was given previously and during the operation, which was accomplished with little bleeding and hardly any suffering. The constitution was at once greatly relieved, rest being procured by moderate opiates, while fluid nourishment and stimuli were freely taken and well borne. On April 18th, recovery was sufficiently advanced

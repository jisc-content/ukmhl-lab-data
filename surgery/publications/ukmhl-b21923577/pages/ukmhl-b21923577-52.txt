32 THE NATURE AND person almost proof against its attacks. On the other hand, original bodily weakness, and the lowering effects of illness and other circumstances, produce a state in which disease may be excited by the slightest causes, and is characterised by debility both in its origin and progress. There is, how- ever, no general term to distinguish affections of this des- cription. It might be convenient, in order to avoid controversy, to arrange the affections of each organ on a simple plan not involving any theoretic views of general pathology. Thus, affections of the eye might be taken in the following order â€¢ First, injuries; secondly, inflammations, divided into two heads, common and specific; thirdly, consequences of inflam- mation; fourthly, organic changes; fifthly, functional derange- ment. We shall hardly find anything that can be said about the diseases of the organ, that is not referable to one or other of these heads. An arrangement of this kind does not take us beyond the extent of our knowledge. When we do not understand the nature of a disease, it is better to acknowledge the fact at once, and leave the matter for further investigation, than to attempt explanation by an imaginary and theoretical view. When we have ascertained the seat and nature of a dis- ease, we can give it a clear and expressive name, which shall at once identify the disease itself. Many affections are named in this way; thus the terms peritonitis, enteritis, pleuritis, pericarditis, denote both the nature and seat of the mischief. In many instances our knowledge is too im- perfect to admit of diseases being thus named, and then they are designated according to some circumstance that is obvious to observation; thus we have such names as dyspnoea, dyspepsia, dysuria, diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera. Frequently the name denotes merely the pain or altered sen-

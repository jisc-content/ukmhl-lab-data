214 MORTIFICATION. from four to six inches in breadth, the integuments in this space being perfectly black. Vivid redness, with some swell- ing, extended along the inner half of the thigh to the groin. The circulation was extremely depressed, but the aspect o- the countenance not altogether unfavorable. He was placed in a warm bed, and a glass of warm brandy and water ad- ministered without delay, the limb being enveloped in a soft poultice. He was able to take beef tea in the evening with repetition of the stimulus, and an opiate was administered at bedtime. Having passed a good night, he had a better pulse the next day. He looked at the limb with perfect coolness, and apparently without alarm. Under the influence of a generous diet, with stimuli and bark, the restorative pro- cesses went on favorably, and he left the hospital quite well in a few weeks. A small black spot on the toe of a free liver, with a bulky frame and red face, would be a more alarming affair than the case of the poor Irishman. It would clearly proclaim an unhealthy state of constitution; it would be an outward and visible sign of inward unsoundness. In forming our prognosis, therefore, we must consider not merely the extent of the local mischief and the importance of the affected part, but also the cause of the mortification, and the state of the constitution. Treatment.—No one plan can be universally applicable in an affection like mortification, which may occur at all ages, in all kinds of constitutions, and in all conditions of health; in a diseased process, of which the causes and progress are very various, being sometimes unattended with risk, at others most dangerous to life, or even inevitably fatal. The general indications are— 1. To prevent its occurrence. 2. To arrest its progress, and combat particular symptoms.

SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS. 113 our complicated frame; hence the necessity of the new supplies, which are received into the digestive organs, and brought by their action into a fit state for admixture with the mass of circulating nutriment. A great portion of man- kind, led away by the gratification incidental to the indul- gence of those appetites which are designed to secure an object of primary importance in the animal economy, intro- duce a larger quantity of new supplies than the wants of the body require. There is excess of nutrition; the system be- comes overfilled. The abundant supply of new matter causes at first a more vigorous exertion of all parts, by which the excess is disposed of. The actions of the vascular system are more energetic; there is actually increased nutrition, with augmentation of bulk, and all the external appearances of health and strength. Sooner or later a state approaching to disease is produced; the pulse is full, easily accelerated; tongue occasionally white ; heat and thirst are often experienced. Perspiration is easily excited. This state is plethora, from excess of nutrition ■ but the organs are not yet diseased; it is the first step from the state of health towards disease. Individuals thus circum- stanced are in constant clanger of disease; a little additional excitement, or some trifling cause brings it on. Local in- flammation easily occurs, and it has the acute inflammatory character. Common experience has established the truth that this external appearance of exuberant health is apt to lead to disease. In common life it is considered dangerous to be congratulated on one's good looks. When a person has been suddenly cut off by acute disease, we often hear the observa- tion that it was quite unexpected, that Mr. — had appeared remarkably well just before his attack. 8

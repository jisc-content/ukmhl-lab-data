CHAPTER III. ON INFLAMMATION: ITS EFFECTS, VARIETIES, AND CAUSES. I have already alluded to the fact that we find the textures of an inflamed part, examined after death, preternaturally red, and the number of the blood-vessels apparently increased, while they are turgid with blood; at the same time interstitial deposition is observed in the structures generally. "When we examine the parts, they feel firmer than natural; notwithstanding which they are more easily lacerated and give way under the application of force, so that the effect of the inflammatory process is to diminish the natural cohesion or firmness of parts, and this is found to be the general result of the disease in its active form. This particular result is often seen in the brain where a peculiar softening takes place * which was originally observed without reference to the cause which produced it. Accurate examination has proved it to be merely a change dependent on inflammation. The newly deposited substance is that formerly and still sometimes called coagulating or coagulable lymph. It is * Softening of the brain often proceeds from inflammatory reaction con- sequent upon disturbance of the cerebral circulation, as after ligature of the carotid artery; another cause consists in the plugging of small arteries by masses of fibrine, dislodged from the valves on the left side of the heart, or from some part of the arterial system, as was first described by Virchow,1 and subsequently by Dr. Kirlces.3 1 Virchow's 'Archiv.' 2 * Mcd-Chir.

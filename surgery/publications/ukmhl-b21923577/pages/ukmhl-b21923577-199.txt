CHAPTER IX. ULCERATION.â€”VARIETIES OF ULCERS. ULCERATION. This process was believed by Mr. Hunter to be the work of the absorbents, and he called it ulcerative absorption, to distinguish it from the gradual removal of structures by which collections of blood or matter, aneurisms and tumours, are brought to the surface of the body, or to that of mucous membranes having external outlets, and from the general shrinking by which diminution of bulk is effected without breach of surface. These natural processes were called by him respectively progressive and interstitial absorption. This view, although supported by an authority of the greatest weight in physiology and pathology, does not rest on any direct evidence, and it involves the assumption of a close analogy between ulceration, which is a disease, and these so- called progressive and interstitial absorptions, which are of a restorative nature. In recent times the close analogy of mortification and ulceration could not fail to attract notice. We observe in both the same essential feature, that is, loss of vitality or destruction, and both are preceded and accom pamed by vascular disturbance of the part, which in most cases can be justly termed inflammation. The difference is

It is clear from the foregoing statement, that if a suspected dog continues well for ten days, he neither has nor has had hydrophobia â€¢ also that if a dog has been bitten by another unequivocally rabid, and remains well for fifty-one days, he will not be affected with rabies. If a person should be bitten by a dog which runs away and is seen no more, the chances against his being mad are a thousand to one, probably much higher; if the bite should also have been inflicted on a covered part, there cannot be the slightest ground for apprehension. Still, if a nervous person should be haunted by the dread of hydrophobia, perhaps the mind will not be quieted till the wounded part has been cut out. I once did this, as I considered, quite unnecessarily, for a surgical colleague, who agreed in the view of the matter which I presented to him, but added simply that he should continue uneasy if the part was not removed. It is hardly necessary to mention the means not unfre- quently resorted to by those who have been bitten by animals supposed to be rabid, on the popular belief that they are capable of preventing the fatal malady. One of them is, in the language of the country, " going to the salt water" to be there ducked with as much perseverance and repetition as can be practised with safety. Another is the swallowing of the so-called Ormskirk medicine, or some other similar com- position of perfectly inert ingredients. As there is no danger in the great majority of instances, the patients believe themselves to have been saved by the processes to Avhich they have been submitted, and thus strengthen the common faith in the efficacy of such means.

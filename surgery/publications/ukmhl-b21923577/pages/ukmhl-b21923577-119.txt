TREATMENT OE INFLAMMATION. 99 combination with other means. Again, small doses of calomel, or of grey powder, given at moderate intervals, are of great service in general feverish disturbance of the system, whether sympathetic or idiopathic, by promoting the secretions and acting on the bowels. They may be used advantageously in this way whenever in such cases the tongue is foul or the mouth dry. But if we were to regard mercurial preparations merely as purgatives or correctives of unhealthy secretions, our notions of their powers would be limited and imperfect. Common experience has established the practical fact that mercury, especially calomel, exhibited freely after bleeding and other evacuations, has the best effect in removing the remaining symptoms, in preventing the changes of structure which continued inflammation will produce, and thus in rendering recovery more speedy and complete. Two grains of calomel alone, or combined with James's powder, or with opium, may be given every six or eight hours, for one, two, or more days. When the mouth has been affected, which shows that the constitution is influenced by the remedy, the progress of recovery is accelerated, the symptoms sometimes not yielding decidedly till this takes place. Such being the fact, recognised by observation, what is the explanation ? Iritis affords a favorable opportunity for observing the mode in which mercury acts. This affection is accompanied by the effusion of fibrine, either interstitially or in smaU portions on the surface or at the edge of the pupil. Under the mer- curial influence the deposition of fibrine is arrested, and that which had been deposited is absorbed. The free use of mercury has been found very serviceable in croup, in that peculiar inflammation of the mucous mem- brane of the trachea and its branches in which fibrine effused, so as to form an adventitious lining to the part. is

TONGUE. 55' The mucous membrane was thickened and uneven; there were no other symptoms. This disease yielded slowly but regularly to mercury, which it was necessary to employ by friction, as the bowels would not bear the internal adminis- tration. The cure was not only complete but permanent. I have seen a few other cases more or less similar to the last. Although they may be confounded with cancer, there are sufficient points of distinction, so that, if the history be investigated and the symptoms carefully examined, there will be little risk of mistaking the comparatively mild and manageable venereal affection, for the very painful, and I fear inevitably fatal cancerous disease. I have always seen the latter begin on the edge of the tongue, generally at the middle or back part; it extends slowly into the substance, and may ultimately involve the greater portion or the whole organ. The hardness, which is in the highest degree, as in the scirrhous breast, renders the part incompressible; it is accurately circumscribed, so that we immediately feel the boundary of the disease. The hardness is less marked in syphilis, more diffused, and not confined in its origin to the margin of the tongue. Scirrhous induration does not last long, nor become considerable in extent without the oc- currence of ulceration, while syphilitic enlargement may occupy one half or nearly the whole part, without any breach of surface. The cancerous ulcer is deep, often with an ash- coloured, partially disorganized and bleeding surface. Some- times profuse and dangerous haemorrhage occurs. The margin is hard, raised, everted, or rugged and excavated. The dis- charge is thin and offensive. The induration in syphilitic ulcerations is comparatively inconsiderable; the surface is of better character, and it seldom penetrates deeply. Cancer of the tongue is a hardened mass, which becomes ulcerated. Syphilitic disease is an ulceration, of which the base and

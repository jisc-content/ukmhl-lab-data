After the child was seized with the symptoms of hydrophobia, I cut out the bitten parts in the man's arm. The disease did not occur in the man, though he had been exposed to the fullest chance of taking it, his arms being bare at the time of the bite, and, as was proved by the occurrence of the disease in the child, the dog beiug at that time certainly in a state capable of communicating it."

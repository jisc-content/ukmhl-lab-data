GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 247 inflammatory swelling by suitable treatment, and then dis- charge and sloughs pass out easily through the wound: should matter be confined by any impediment in the suppurative stage, an opening may then be made for its discharge. The only reason for making incisions in the early stage would be to remove splinters of bone, balls, or other foreign bodies. More or less variety may be expected in the nature of the mischief if we include under the general expression of gun- shot wounds all the injuries inflicted by fragments of shells, explosions, and other incidents of actual warfare. The wound may be lacerated, and not contused. Thus at the siege of the citadel of Antwerp, M. H. Larrey saw several cases where the solutions of continuity were perfectly regular, and more or less like those made by a cutting instrument. These, however, are exceptional occurrences. The general course is that the surface of the wound, disorganized by the violence of the injury, sloughs, inflammation and suppuration occurring in order to throw off the dead portions. Thus discharge from the wound, with some swelling and heat, may be expected at the end of four or five days. When this suppurative stage begins, cold applications are laid aside and poultices substituted. As soon as the sloughs have been detached, granulation and cicatrization follow. Fistulous openings may remain connected with injured bone or the pre- sence of foreign bodies, and in the former case inflammation with discharge of bony fragments may be renewed occasion- ally, for an indefinite period. Secondary haemorrhage is not uncommon in this suppu- rative stage. Wounded arteries, which may have ceased to bleed at the time of the injury, may become troublesome from the clearance which the track of the wound now undergoes. From about the eighth day, therefore, patients must be closely watched whenever there is reason to suspect, from the

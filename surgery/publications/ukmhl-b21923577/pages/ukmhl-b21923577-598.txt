578 FUNGUS H7KMAT0DESâ€”CAUSES. height of between two or three inches. In this extent the bony structure had disappeared, its place being occupied by the disease, which had just penetrated the articular surface at one point. The chance of permanent relief by amputation is more favorable when fungus hsematodes occurs in bone than when it exists in other structures. If the whole bone can be removed, as in the case of the tibia, by amputation above the knee, the chance of permanent cure is better. The point is more doubtful in the femur, although the bone may be divided some inches above the diseased part, and where it seems quite sound. Some years ago I amputated above the thigh in a case of fungoid disease in the inner condyle of the bone. The patient was older, over forty, and thinner than in the preceding case, so that the diagnosis was easy before the operation, the event of which was perfectly satis- factory. Although the wound healed well, the stump was still swelled, with some hardness of the soft structures around the bone when the patient left the hospital, so that I warned him to let me know immediately if anything should happen. More than a year afterwards he was quite well. I gave the same caution to the patient whose case is related above when he left the hospital thirteen months after the operation, and nothing has been heard of him since. The cause is just as obscure in this case as in cancer, and we are equally at a loss in both instances for a satisfactory account of the matter. Patients frequently ascribe the origin to some accidental occurrence, often of a trivial kind, as in the instance already related at p. 575, where it seems qurte as probable that disease already begun should have caused the sensation complained of, as that the latter should have pre- ceded and excited the malady. The evidence of an external cause must be admitted in the case of a gentleman, fifty-two years of age, under my care long ago, before the formation of

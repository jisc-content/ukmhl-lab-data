ULCERATION. 191 ulceration of the integuments, the ulcerations being painful and difficult to heal, but not presenting any other peculiari- ties. Not unfrequently the surrounding integuments, to a greater or less extent, are in a state of chronic eczema. There is sometimes inflammation of the neighbouring veins, with great pain. It is necessary in the first instance to remove this inflammation by rest, poulticing, and probably leeches, which may be employed, not only safely, but advantageously on the inflamed skin and over the inflamed veins. When the parts have been brought into a quiet state, and repair is beginning, general pressure of the entire limb below the knee, by an elastic bandage, will be most useful, and the continual employment of support by bandage or elastic stocking will be necessary to prevent relapse. The eczematous state of the integuments may be remedied by a strong solution of nitrate of silver after the surface has been thoroughly and perfectly cleaned. The irritability of the ulcer may sometimes be removed by the same application. Inflamed ulcer.â€”Inflammation is the source of ulceration in most cases ; hence nearly all are at first inflamed ulcers. The continuation of ulceration indicates extension of inflam- mation, and its supervention in a healing sore stops the healing, and produces relapse of ulceration with enlargement of the sore. We have now to consider the last-mentioned sub- ject. The degree of disturbance varies greatly, the differences being loosely marked by the term under which the cases are mentioned, as ill-conditioned, painful, irritable, inflamed, or sloughing sores. In a severe case the margin of the sore is fiery red, with general swelling, redness, and heat of the limb. The granulations have disappeared, and instead of them the ulcer presents an irregular bottom of a foul, greyish, yellow- ish, or brownish colour, often streaked with blood. When the

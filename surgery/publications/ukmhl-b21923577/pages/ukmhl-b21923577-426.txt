The sore and induration, which had existed for two months, were cured in three weeks. A gentleman had a reddish thickening and induration of the prepuce, forming a considerable elongated enlargement, which had existed nearly two years; it went away under the use of mercury employed for other symptoms.

The sore healed in a fortnight under mercurial treatment; the indu- ration had nearly gone in six weeks more. This patient, with whom I was acquainted for many years, had no secon- dary symptoms.

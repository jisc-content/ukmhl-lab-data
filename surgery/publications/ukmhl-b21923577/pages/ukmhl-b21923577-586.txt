566 EPITHELIAL CANCERâ€”FEMALES. the affection of the absorbent glands be discovered to be simple enlargement, -without change of structure, as clearly as the case admits of, the operation might be undertaken on the chance, confessedly quite uncertain, of the glandular swelling subsiding. The disease begins in the female most frequently on the internal aspect of the labia, or in the clitoris, with obvious marks of increased vascular activity, and morbid expansion of natural structures, in various and generally painful forms. As enlargement proceeds, the movement of the parts in progression, and the rubbing of dress, are sources of much suffering and distress. Irritating applications of all kinds are injurious. Free excision is followed by sound cica- trization, and relieves completely for the time, but disease returns in the neighbourhood, and is again removed. Ulti- mately the clitoris, nymphse, and all between the labia to the entrance of the vagina are sacrificed, the whole course of the affair occupying sometimes four or five years. Ulceration may affect the prepuce in the male, the neigh- bourhood of the clitoris and the entrance of the vagina in the female, advancing slowly without great pain. It destroys the mucous membrane, and thus presents an excavated and uneven surface, with indurated and sharp cut edge. It has the character and symptoms ascribed to the rodent ulcer of the face, heretofore regarded as cancer, but having a better prospect of cure from operation. I have only seen this affec- tion in females, when from their natural delicacy they have concealed it too long to admit of operation. In a gentleman with an ulcer of this kind, nearly as large as a half-crown on the lining of the prepuce, I excised, the part, not including the integument, which was sound. I saw him twelve years after, in consequence of an apoplectic attack, from winch he died, and there had been no return of disease in the prepuce.

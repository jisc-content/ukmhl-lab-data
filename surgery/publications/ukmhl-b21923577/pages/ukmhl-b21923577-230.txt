210 - MORTIFICATION, fiammation not of the highest kind. In order to appreciate these eases, we must consider not only the local disturbance, but the previous state of the part, and the condition of the constitution. Either local or general debility, and more par- ticularly the combination of both, constitute a great predis- position to mortification. The arrest of the circulation when a part is frostbitten, and still more if the skin should be frozen weakens the part to such a degree that it will not bear the influx of blood if suddenly warmed, but inflames and mortifies, while it may be perfectly recovered if the natural temperature is restored very slowly. The skin, weakened by constant pressure in long confinement to bed, easily inflames and sloughs. A^ain, in weakened constitutions, slight causes, and appa- rently trivial degrees of inflammation may cause mortifica- tion. Thns, making scarifications, which are small super- ficial cuts, in anasarcous legs, in order to let out the fluid with which they are loaded, a practice altogether unnecessary may cause not only painful inflammation, but even mortification. The application of blisters is stdl worse. I saw a patient in an advanced stage of dropsy, in whom a blister had been placed on the calf of each leg. The entire surfaces mortified, thus terminating existence prematurely by a painful death. . f i Andral has recorded a similar fatal occurrence m a fen ale a„ed forty-three, in whom organic toease of the hver, omach, pancreas, and omentnm existed and who tremely emaciated and weak, with vonntmg, —^ small, Id frequent pulse, hot and dry skm. Busfa- applied to the legs; violent pain, and extreme produced, followed hy prostration. The vacated u fee were covered hy a hlack stratum, and the patent dredm two days from the application.

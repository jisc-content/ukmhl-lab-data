TREATMENT OP INFLAMMATION. 89 the inflamed vessels themselves, so as immediately to unload them. You will not, I trust, misunderstand my observations, so as to suppose that I recommend the loss of blood or particularly general bleeding in all cases. Remember that I have been speaking of acute inflammation, attended generally with in- flammatory fever in cases of importance, either from the nature of the affected organ or the extent of the mischief. There are many inflammations in which it is not necessary to abstract blood, either generally or locally; there are others in which local bleeding answers every purpose, in conjunction with other means. You must consider, in particular in- stances, the importance of the affected part, the degree of disturbance, the probability that continuance of the inflam- mation may alter structure and impair function, also the presence or absence of constitutional disturbance. You must bear in mind the age, constitution, and habit of body, the general powers of the patient, and regulate your choice of means by a combined view of these several particulars. When it is your object to arrest inflammation suddenly, on account of the importance of the organ, or the immediate urgency of the symptoms, or from apprehension of those structural changes which inflammation often produces, you will find it advantageous to employ general bleeding, and to take at once such a quantity of blood as will influence the circulation. You will thus arrest inflammation more effect- ually, and at less expense to the constitution, than by the repetition of smaller bleedings. Should your own reflection satisfy you that the foregoing- remarks on the loss of blood, as a therapeutic measure, are sound, you will not, I trust, be deterred from acting on them by the outcry and alarm raised against the practice of late years, which, originating on insufficient grounds, has been

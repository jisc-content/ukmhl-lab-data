574 FUNGUS HNEMATODES. fungoid state. Constitutional disturbance and pain may attend throughout, with certainty of aggravation in the advanced period by loss of appetite, rest, and flesh, under which the powers of life give way, and the patient sinks. In the progress of the malady secondary disease is de- veloped in various internal organs, particularly the lungs and liver, even in the brain and bones. These are some- times more numerous and varied than in cancer. The original tumour presents on a section a clearly marked lobular arrangement, the distinction of the lobes being sometimes very complete. Their principal bulk consists of the peculiar morbid structure on which their characteristic softness depends, varying in consistence from that of the brain to thick cream. This substance sometimes escapes at once from the cut surface, but more copiously on pressure, and still more abundantly after ' maceration, becoming diffused in the water, with which it mixes readily. After this material has been got rid of, an irregular fibrous framework, by which it had been supported, remains. The firmer specimens present the same lobular character on a section, with solidity of feel and appearance, but a soft substance, of cream-like consist- ence, is brought out, in greater or less quantity, by pressing the knife along the cut surface. There is an indefinite number of intermediate gradations between the softest and the firmest of these growths, and consequently in the relative proportions of the characteristic so-called medullary material and the firmer tissue which contains and supports it. The swellings are covered by a thin capsule, which separates them from the surrounding structure. This insulation presents a striking1 contrast to the invariable extension of cancerous disease to all contiguous structures. Blood-vessels are large and numerous, with thin coats, in the medullary growths ami their capsules, also in the immediately surrounding parts,

88 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. believe that there is any essential distinction in pathology and therapeutics between town and country. We must direct our practice in either situation not by any abstract principle, but by careful consideration of each case. Local bleeding may be employed after general depletion, or alone in less violent and urgent cases. When the local disturbance has been checked, and the secondary effects, constituting the state of sympathetic in- flammatory fever, have been removed or lessened, the local abstraction of blood will accomplish all that remains to be done. Our choice lies between two means, cupping and leeches; for scarifications and punctures are applicable to a few cases only, and hence not to be regarded as general means. Cupping is the more efficacious ; we can succeed in getting a larger quan- tity of blood, and it is drawn more quickly, that is, if the operator be skilful. Cupping is not applicable in some situa- tions, nor where the surface is inflamed, on account of the pain. To be efficacious, leeches must be employed m greater numbers than are usually applied. In the adult it is seldom worth while to employ fewer than ten or twelve when we wish to check any inflammation decidedly, as in the eye; while in serious cases the number must be increased to two or three dozen. . When employed in such numbers, leeches are as effective as venesection, and sometimes more so. If, as commonly computed, each leech takes half an ounce of blood, a large quantity is drawn when three or four dozens are applied When they can be placed on or very near to the seat ot disease, as on an inflamed extremity or on the abdomen in peritonitis, they are peculiarly useful, abstracting as much blood as we should take by venesection, and drawing it from

PRIMARY SORES—TREATMENT. 399 mischief has been brought on by high inflammation, as the effect of neglect or intemperance, and complicated with phy- mosis, the penis, and especially the prepuce, being swelled, red, and shining, with offensive ichorous or sanious discharge from its contracted orifice, the indication to abate the local mischief by dividing the prepuce is most urgent. Both glans and prepuce are highly inflamed; the swollen glans stretches the foreskin, while the latter, thickened and in- durated by inflammation, acts like a bandage on the inflamed glans. If effectual relief is not afforded by incision, the distended prepuce suppurates and sloughs on its convexity, forming a ragged hole, through which the glans protrudes, with relief of the distress. The prepuce is to be divided with a curved bistoury, carried along a director, introduced from the orifice to the angle of reflexion. Copious bleeding usually follows, with great relief both of the part and the constitution. If, however, it should be excessive, which it seldom is, it must be stopped by the usual means. A soft bread poultice, with rest in bed, and an opiate if there is much pain, soon make the patient easy. The slough is soon detached, the inflammation of the glans and prepuce ceases, and a healthy granulation with good pus succeeds, forming a striking contrast to the previous con- dition. If the prepuce does not give way, the glans may mortify to a greater or less extent. To determine whether the prepuce should be divided not is sometimes a difficult point of diagnosis. The de°rt of redness, swelling, and pain will not enable us to deride" The propriety of the measure depends on the condition of the sore, which we cannot see. The discharge' from the orifice of the prepuce must assist our judgment in doubtful cases. An ichorous or sanious state of discharge, with fetor indicates sloughing; and in such circumstances the division or cgree

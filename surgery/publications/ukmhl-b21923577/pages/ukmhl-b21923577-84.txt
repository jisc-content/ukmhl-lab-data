64 INFLAMMATION, which pervade the entire organism and become apparent only during inflammatory action, are points which I shall leave, without further comment, for the consideration of those in- terested in such matters. The differences here mentioned are more noticed m cases of spontaneous than in those of accidental inflammation. All the textures involved in a wound suppurate, although mus- cular and fibrous tissues are hardly known to suppurate otherwise. . . . HI Degree—The inflammatory disturbance varies m its amonnt or quantity; there may be more or less of it; when m„e, the process is rapid; when less, slower. These differences, as I have already stated, are marhed by the epithets acute and chronic, those terms denotmg differences in degree, not in land. Violence of symptoms and rapidity of course are seen, in acute; mildness and slowness in chrome. The terms are not opposed to each other in sense. Acute, which means sharp, refers to the symptoms, especially the pain. Chronic, i. e. enduring, to the time occupied " You are not to suppose that there are just two.degrees.of violence, so that each case can be referred without hesxtation „ one or the other; on the contrary, between the mo violent, rapid, or acute, and the mildest and — th - a great and indefinite number of gradations, like tb in mediate shades between two colours. Some adopt tb c degrees, acute, subacute, chronic. Acute is synonym u with active, violent, phlegmonous; snob a disturbance is violent to last. It must be cut short by treatment, 01 it destroy or disorganize the part. Chronic is also called languid, slow, indolent The vascu !ar disturbance is less ; the redness inconsiderable or pain trifling or none; sympathetic influences hard.y no c . Consequently there is no constitutional disturbance; but the

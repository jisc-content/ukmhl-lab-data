SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS. 115 of constitutional unhealthiness, produced by causes which have been long in operation. Is the term plethora literally correct ? It has been questioned whether the vessels really contain more blood in such cases, and consequently whether the term plethora be literally correct. This is a point difficult to deter- mine. We do not know what the natural, regular or normal quantity of blood is; we have no means of ascertaining how much the vessels contain in a given instance; thus we want data for comparison. We cannot be certain that an indivi- dual in the state I have mentioned has more blood in his vessels than at another time. Yet we often find unnatural fulness and strength of pulse; it is accelerated by slight exertion. The blood sometimes exhibits the inflammatory characters. Hence, whether the quantity of blood be greater or not, the vascular system is in an unhealthy condition. It is a state like that of females in whom menstruation has been suppressed, or has not occurred at the proper period, where we often see flushed countenance, pain of head, and heat of surface. It is a similar state to that of persons in whom large ulcers have healed rapidly. The superficial veins of the limbs are fuller and more prominent than usual, and I cannot help thinking that there is an increased quantity of blood, which we sometimes find it advantageous to diminish. Acute inflammation occurring in a plethoric person requires active antiphlogistic treatment, both on account of the local malady, and of the plethoric state of constitution. We seldom have to treat the latter alone, because persons thus circumstanced do not consider themselves ill. If we had two means would be sufficient, viz., depletion and abstinence, the former to bring down the system to a safe point in the scale of health, the latter to prevent it from becoming again

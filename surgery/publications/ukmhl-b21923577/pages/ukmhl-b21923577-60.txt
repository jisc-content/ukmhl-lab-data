40 THE NATURE AND so named; in other words, the proximate cause is the disease itself. The subject of causes will be best understood by stating a case. An individual of stout frame and sanguineous tem- perament, with short neck, is of full habit, produced by indulgence in eating and drinking. He makes ahearty dinner or supper, filling his stomach with food; and shortly after falls back in his chair, loses consciousness, and has an attack of apoplexy. He either dies almost immediately, or without regaining his senses or voluntary motion. On examining the body in two or three days, effusion of blood into the sub- stance of some part of the brain is found. In this case, if you regard the loss of sensation and voluntary motion as the disease, the pressure on the brain by the effusion of blood is the proximate cause. If, however, as would be more correct, you consider the loss of sensibility and mobility as symptoms, the cerebral hemorrhage would be the proximate cause, and must itself have depended on an unhealthy condition of blood- vessels, induced by excess or indulgence, and giving way under the excitement of the circulation by a full meal. The latter would be called the occasional or exciting cause of the cerebral hemorrhage, of which the apoplexy or palsy would be the symptoms. The sanguineous temperament, short neck, and fulness of habit, are the predisposing or remote causes. Thus, in investigating the mode in which disease is produced, we see a series of changes, each of which m re- ference to that which preceded, and to that which follows, is successively effect and cause. _ Having, then, observed the nature of the case, having noted the existing symptoms, and traced the previous history having watched the course and progress of the disease, and its termination, we complete our investigation by opening the body, in case death should have occurred. We thus find

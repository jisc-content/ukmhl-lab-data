28 THE NATUKE AND such treatment being calculated in many cases rather to aggravate than to remove disease. On such pathological views the treatment of palsy would be directed to the loss of power in the paralysed parts, to the neglect of the real seat of the mischief in the brain. In the same way amaurotic affections, regarded as weakness of sight, have too often been treated by tonics and stimuli of all kinds, with the sure result of increasing the disease of the retina and hastening its progress. At one time the explanation of all diseases turned on the changes supposed to take place in the animal fluids ; while, at a subsequent period, all share in the explanation of morbid phenomena has been denied them. In the early period of medical art, when anatomy and physiology were nearly un- known, the enumeration of these fluids was altogether imagi- nary j and they were supposed to be capable of derangement in variety of ways, chemical and mechanical, analogous to those which fluids might undergo out of the body. All diseases were explained on the supposition of changes in these fluids, and the means of treatment were directed to remedy such sup- posed alterations. When anatomy and physiology began to be cultivated, and the organic changes taking place in disease came to be investigated by examinations after death, these notions were, put an end to; the humoral pathology, as it is called, was hardly spoken of, except in terms of contempt, and the animal fluids were then disregarded in the attempts to explain the nature of disease. The constantly advancing knowledge of anatomy and physiology during the last century, could not fail to rectify notions so completely erroneous; and the really wonderful progress of chemistry in recent times has thrown so much light on all parts of the subject as to convince us that an intimate acquaintance with the nature and composition of the animal fluids is as necessary to sound

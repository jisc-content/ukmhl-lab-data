148 SUPPURATION. solution of continuity, with a bloody effusion. Oil from the adipous membrane is sometimes mixed with the pus. In a patient who had laboured under fever, and who came to St. Bartholomew's Hospital from the Fever Hospital, there was a large abscess on the hip ; the contents were pus and oil, the latter floating on the surface of the former. The opening became obstructed before the sac was emptied, and I drew out a lump of the common adipous matter twice as large as the last joint of my thumb. In the matter discharged from a mammary abscess m a suckling woman it is not uncommon to see milk clearly recognisable, and sometimes partially curdled or creamy. Portions of hepatic substance are seen in the pus discharged from an abscess of the liver, which may also have a brownish red tinge. The fluid of an abscess has been supposed to undergo changes before it acquires the full characters of pus. Matter is said to be well elaborated or concocted. The older writers speak of the maturation or ripening of an abscess. We find, on the contrary, that pus is formed at once, with its full characters. Indeed, the fluid seen at the very beginning is serous, thin, with bloody tinge; but pus soon shows itself and is perfect in its characters. In the same way denuded skin first secretes a transparent serum, then pus; and there is a gradual transition from the natural colourless fluid of mucous membranes to the secretion not distinguishable from pus But in all these cases, when the purulent secretion is established, the pus is formed at once with its full properties. Thus the cyst of an abscess is a kind of newly formed organ in the animal economy, a new organ for a new product. I secretes and it absorbs. Hence, if the inflammation be brought to an end, the matter may be taken up by the absorbents, and thus a spontaneous cure may be effected.

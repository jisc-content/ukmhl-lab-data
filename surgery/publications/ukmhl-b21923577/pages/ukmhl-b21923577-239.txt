FROSTBITE—TRAUMATIC GANGRENE. 219 a friend who notices the deathy -whiteness of the affected skin. Treatment.—If inflammation should have been produced, with swelling, redness, heat, and great pain, the usual antiphlogistic measures may be employed according to the violence and extent of the local symptoms. Let it be ob- served, however, that during the siege of Sebastopol frost bites were extremely common among the men at work in the trenches. The surgeons there found that in all instances positive evil ensued by surgical interference of any kind. The mortified parts were allowed to separate. Traumatic gangrene.—All mortifications excited by direct violence come under this term; the slighter cases are unim- portant. But when mortification follows from local injury of the more serious kind, attacking at once an entire division of a limb, and rapidly spreading to the trunk, the affection is of the greatest consequence, and may decide the patient's fate in a few hours. It comes on in consequence of injuries attended with violent and extensive bruising and laceration, with injury of vessels and ecchymosis, especially when complicated with fracture or dislocation; in bad gunshot injuries, and compound dislocations. Severe pain occurs in three or more days after the accident; the limb swells, loses its natural colour and temperature, and becomes cold. It is variously dis- coloured, greenish, livid, blackish. The cuticle is loosened or raised by effusions of turbid reddish fluid. The cellular texture is loaded with a yellow or bloody serum. The mor- tification rapidly reaches the trunk. Larrey, who had seen it principally in consequence of gunshot injuries, has known this to happen in six hours. The only question in such a case is whether immediate amputation offers any chance of saving life : if we wajt uutil

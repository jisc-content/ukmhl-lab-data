Thus calomel in small quantity is combined with other aperients to unload the bowels, and the gray powder may be used with rhubarb as a mild aperient, when the secretions are unhealthy. Sometimes a more active and continued use of this mercurial may be advisable to check the progress of disorganization, and it might be sometimes necessary for this purpose to go on with it so as to affect the system, the constitution being well supported at the same time. A safe and convenient mode of exhibiting mercury in small doses in some scrofulous cases is afforded by the bi- chloride, of which a grain may be dissolved in two ounces of tincture of bark or rhubarb, one drachm to be taken twice daily. Local Treatment.â€”Inflamed absorbent glands proceeding to suppuration, or subcutaneous abscesses, are best treated by poulticing. In order to avoid unsightly cicatrices on the face or neck, especially in females, it is desirable to prevent inflammation and thinning of the skin. The matter should be evacuated by a careful lancet puncture before the skin is changed in colour, and poultice should be continued. In languid and tedious ulceration, whether consequent on suppuration or otherwise, resin ointment, and the solution of sulphate of zinc, or nitrate of silver, will be useful. Lint or rag dipped in sea water, or simple ointment, will be sufficient when things are going on favorably. In simple enlarge- ment without active inflammation, the part may be covered with soap plaster as an external defence. In chronic in- flammation of an important part, such as the testicle, the use of mercurial ointment or plaster may be necessary. The tincture of iodine, or the iodide ointment, will be available in chronic scrofulous enlargements generally. The principle of counter-irritation by blistering, or preferably by the emetic tartar ointment, is often useful.

440 SYPHILISâ€”INOCULATION AND SYPH1LIZATION. In considering the treatment of constitutional syphilis it is necessary to speak of inoculation and syphilid, on the former of which I have little and on the latter no personal experience. Mr. Hunter and Mr. Benjamin Bell, of Edin- burgh, many years ago, occupied themselves much with inoculating both gonorrhoea! matter and the discharge from venereal sores, principally in reference to the question of identity or diversity of the poison in the two cases. For some years inoculation of patients, with the discharge of their own primary sores more particularly, has been extensively prac- tised in France, and perhaps elsewhere on the Continent, partly for pathological illustration, partly as an assistance m diagnosis and a guide in treatment. As this proceeding throws little light on the nature of the disease and affords still less aid in its management, I cannot help considering it unnecessary as well as dangerous, and I am at a loss to understand what justification can be pleaded for its continuance. Two large, most painful, and intractable ulcers, the result of two inoculations, were under my care for several weeks, resisting every variety of treatment. The patient resorted elsewhere for the relief which I had failed to give him, so that I do not know how the matter ended. The inoculation in this case was performed by a foreign physician, then resi- dent in London. Syphilization consists in producing a syphilitic sore by the inoculation of infectious matter, then inoculating the patient with discharge from his own sore, and so on repeatedly. The result of experience is alleged to be that the effect becomes gradually milder and milder, till it is reduced at last to a mere puncture, which does not discharge, the patient being then said to be syphilid. The secondary symptoms, for winch the treatment is recommended, are said to come to an end during the process. This proceeding has been largely pra^

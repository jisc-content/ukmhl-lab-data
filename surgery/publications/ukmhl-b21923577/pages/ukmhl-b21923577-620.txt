A large tumour could be felt in the abdomen below the epigastric region, and a smaller on the spine below. FUNGUS BLEMATODES IN THE BONES.

Having there stated that the chance of perfect recovery is greater when the head of the tibia is the seat of the disease, I think it necessary to mention two cases which throw some doubt on this point. Case.â€”Medullary disease in the superior articular extremity of the tibia, with secondary affection of the inguinal glands and the liver. I was consulted on February 21st, 1825, by a gentleman, twenty-two years of age, tall, of stout frame, fair com- plexion, and light hair, for a swelling at the knee. There was a general fulness about the tibia, with a slight red- ness. -Pain was brought on by exercise and ceased by rest.

Having been quite well at the pre- ceding Christmas, he had felt pain in the knee since, and supposing it to be rheumatic had endeavoured to dance it off, and went to Cambridge to pursue his studies. He returned to London in the beginning of March, when the complaint was worse. The late Mr. Okes, of Cambridge, had felt pulsation in the part, and thought the disease aneurismal.

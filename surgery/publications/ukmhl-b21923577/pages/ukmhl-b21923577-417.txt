PRIMARY SORES. 397 however acute, seems to be capable of deciding on its nature;" and that all his reasoning is founded " upon the presumption that diseases which get well spontaneously are not syphilitic." (' Observations on Diseases resembling Syphilis/ pp. 44, 54.) The generative organs, like other parts, are liable to common disease, and thus may present appearances liable to be confounded, from their situation, with those resulting from syphilis, but easily distinguishable. Laceration or excoriation of the male or female organs may occur in intercourse, with slight bleeding; the effect being immediate, and probably without suspicion of infection. This may be more probable if the secretions of the female organs should be unhealthy, though without suspicion of infection. Accumulation of the sebaceous secretion may irritate the corona glandis or the lining of the prepuce. In herpes prasputii, there are one or two small red patches on the integument of the prepuce, on each of which a small cluster of vesicles, four or six in number, is developed. Transparent at first, they soon become opaque, and then dry up: such vesicles may form on the glans. In psoriasis prseputii there is thickening, with fissures of the orifice of the prepuce. This and the preceding affection are altogether unlike any primary syphilitic sore, and occur most fre- quently when there has been no exposure to infection. Small vesicles or pustules are sometimes seen on the glans in conjunction with stricture or irritation of the urethra. The foregoing account is a simple enumeration of the sores caused by infection in sexual intercourse, according to their obvious characters, and not involving any doctrinal points Such sores have been arranged in two divisions, the hard and soft primary sores. The terms are ill chosen as applied to ulcerated surfaces, of which the differences in consistence are so slight as to be hardly recognisable. By hard chancre is

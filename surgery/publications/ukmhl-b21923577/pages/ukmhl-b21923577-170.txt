150 SUPPURATION. with the other. Frequently, direct examination will not enable us to determine the point: we must combine with careful examination of the part a consideration of the other symptoms. Progress to the surf ace.-When suppuration has begun, the abscess becomes larger and larger, increasing in all directions, but extending principally where the resistance is least. Generally, therefore, it enlarges towards the external surface, or towards that of any mucous canal. This progress of an abscess, however, towards the exterior, or towards the natural mucous outlets, does not depend simply on the circumstance of there being less resistance in those directions; for abscesses will take either of these courses, although there should be less opposition in other quarters. Thus abscesses in the abdominal or thoracic parieties, or in the pelvis, make then- way outwards; and those forming deep in a part, equally tend to the surface, so as to bring about a discharge of their contents externally. There is gradual removal of the intervening parts, and approach of the matter to the surface, it being still walled m by adhesive inflammation as the removal proceeds. Thus deposition and removal, opposite processes, are going on together in different portions of the same swelling; the latter on the exterior, to bring the matter to the surface the former, of pus and lymph, in the cavity and wall of the jibsccss As the fluid advances to the exterior, the coverings become thinner and thinner, and the fluctuation is more and more distinct. The inflammatory swelling of the surrounding parts is lessened; but the central portion, where the sense at fluctuation is most plain, continues to enlarge, and rises into a prominence more or less pointed: this is the pointing ot an abscess. The skin becomes red, tense, and shining J it is

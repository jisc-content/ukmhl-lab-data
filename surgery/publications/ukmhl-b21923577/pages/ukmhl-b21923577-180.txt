100 SUPPURATION. It may be considered probable that the neighbourhood of the large intestine has some influence in producing the phe- nomenon. A lad, about sixteen, was nnder my care in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, with a considerable inflammation in the parietes of the abdomen, immediately over the ascending colon. This complaint had showed itself very soon after an inflammation of the bowels. Fluctuation became manifest, and I punctured the swelling, giving issue to six or eight ounces of thick, white, and apparently well-formed pus, but very fetid. The abscess healed quickly and favorably. The presence of blood promotes decomposition of pus; thus, in all cases that I have seen of suppurating aneurismal sacs, where the matter has been mixed with coagula, it has been fetid. An Irishman was under my care with a swelling in tbe middle of the thigh at its inside; it was firm, and ex- ceedingly painful. Leeches, poultices, and other means were employed, with little or no relief, and the patient continued â– to complain of severe pain. After some time fluctuation was perceived, and I evacuated by puncture two or three ounces of fetid pus mixed with coagula. The patient soon recovered. In a person who died of phlebitis, an abscess had occurred m the arm, and was opened before death. It contained fetid pus with a mixture of coagula. Matter which has been in contact with dead bone is usu- ally stinking. This decomposition and stinking state of matter are not unfavorable circumstances. Both the local and general symptoms are severe; but, when the abscess has been free y opened, the recovery proceeds just as favorably and quickly as if the matter had not displayed these peculiar characters. A middle-aged woman who had been previously healthy, came under my care in St. Bartholomew's with an extremely painful, bright-red swelling on the inside of the thigh at its

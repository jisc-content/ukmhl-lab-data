25 DIVISIONS OF DISEASES. merely the living condition of the parts, and are not ascer- tainable after death. The living condition of an organ which is necessary for the regular execution of its function com- prises not only the structure as seen after death, but also a proper supply of healthy blood, and an uninterrupted exer- cise of that influence which connects the part with the nervous system, and in many cases, sympathetically, with other organs of the body. Nearly the whole of the slighter changes elude our observation; so that in many instances we cannot say whether a particular organ is in a condition fitted to exercise its functions properly or not. In some diseases we can see how the organ is affected in its vital conditions, we can observe how it is influenced by this kind of alteration. The functions of the brain, for example sensation, and volun- tary motion, will be suspended when the action of the heart is suddenly stopped, as in syncope; or when the function of the lungs is arrested, as in the case of suffocation. Under the former the supply of blood to the brain fails in quantity, under the latter in quality, the necessary change from venous to arterial not having taken place; while in both the structure of the organ is unaltered. When, therefore, we speak of diseases being functional, we mean merely to express that we can observe no change of structure in the organs during life, nor discover any after death, and we use the word functional in contra-distinction to organic, which denotes visible changes in the organs of the body, ascertainable by dissection. This distinction between functional and organic disease, although often convenient in common language, is loose and indefinite, and hardly admis- sible in a scientific sense. The term organic, indeed, is used chiefly to denote the more serious alterations of structure which are permanent, impairing or destroying function and even endangering life, such as cancer, ossification, indurations

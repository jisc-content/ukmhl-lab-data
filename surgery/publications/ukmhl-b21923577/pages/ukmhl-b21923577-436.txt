The ulcer, which is very painful, extends by a succession of these sloughs, while granulation and cicatri- zation are going on in the opposite direction of the same sore. In neglected cases these sores are seen under various modifications of size, form, and degree of sloughing, some- times with elevation of the spreading margin. When these syphilitic ulcerations are left uncovered, the discharge con- cretes into dark, brownish, or blackish flat scabs. If the ulcer is spreading rapidly, these crusts will assume a pro- minent, conical shape, not much unlike that of the limpet shell. The scab increases by successive additions at its base, which push up the portions previously deposited; it thus resembles a number of concentric rings, placed one over the other, the largest at bottom, the smallest at top. These sores sometimes exist in great number, occurring in various parts of the body, creating much suffering and constitutional disturbance from their painful character. The affection, including the vesicle or pustule with which it begins, which has usually broken before we have the opportunity of seeing, and the scabbed sores which follow, constitute Rupia simplex, or L. prominens, according as the scab is flat or conical It is well figured by Bateman in his 'Delineations of Cutaneous Diseases/ plates 53 and 54. These eruptions are most commonly distinct, but not always so; they are sometimes of mixed character. The tubercular and the scaly are frequently combined. Pnstules may coexist with scaly eruption, and thus we see ulcerations conjoined with the coppery patches. In papular eruption some of the pimples, as might be expected, often become pustular. Other syphilitic affections of the s*m.-Besides the erup- tions now described, there are ulcerations of the skm, more or less important, of not infrequent occurrence in secondary

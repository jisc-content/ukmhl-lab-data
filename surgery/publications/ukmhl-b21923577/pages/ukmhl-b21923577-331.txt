TETANUS. 311 been kept perfectly at rest, when, on the sixth or seventh day, tetanus came on in a most alarming form in the jaws and mnscles of deglutition, with entire inability to swallow. This distressing condition was completely removed by the use of chloroform, after which swallowing was quite easy, and the system was so far tranquillised as to give a more favorable impression of the case. Although the improvement lasted several hours, the hopes thus excited proved illusive, the symptoms returning with great violence, and proving fatal in less than forty-eight hours from the first outbreak. Some practitioners have relied chiefly on tonic and stimulating treatment, carrying it to a great extent by large doses of quinine and carbonate of iron, with or without beer, wine, spirits, and medicinal stimuli and cordials. The severe and almost incessant suffering inseparable from the complaint soon brings on great general weakness, under which the free use of quinine would be indicated, and certainly unobjec- tionable, if preceded and accompanied by the attentions to the state of the alimentary canal already enforced. Would it succeed as a sole remedy from the first, and would it super- sede the necessity of opiates in dealing with the terrible con- vulsive paroxysms ? The same observations are applicable to the use of iron, of which the carbonate, in its necessarily large doses, would be the most objectionable form where deglutition is difficult. The tincture of the sesquichloride would be more convenient. The employment of diffusible stimuli, under suitable precautions, would be consistent with the use of quinine and iron, and would be advantageous in the weakened condition to which the patient is reduced in the more chronic form of the disease after the greatest danger has passed. I know no evidence that it would be useful or even safe to give beer, wine, and brandy in large quantity from the beginning as the sole or principal treatment.

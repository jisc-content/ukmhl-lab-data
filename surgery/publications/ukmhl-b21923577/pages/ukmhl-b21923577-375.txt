SYPHILIS—TBEATMENT. 355 teacli us a salutary lesson, that of examining for ourselves the evidence of general doctrines, and distrusting the authority even of the highest names, in matters of opinion. The sub- version of the long-established criterion has of course over- thrown all the speculations built upon it respecting syphilis, and diseases resembling syphilis, but not being venereal. Hence we may altogether discard the expressions of pseudo- syphilis, syphiloid diseases, cachexia syphiloidea, sequela? of syphilis, terms, which having either no distinct meaning, or an erroneous one, have only tended to perplex and embarrass us in investigating a naturally difficult subject.

These are renewed from time to time in some instances, being often severe in their local and general effects, and requiring the employ- ment of remedies that act powerfully on the system. Thus in some cases the constitution is ultimately enfeebled, or the patient sinks under the complaint and the remedies! This happens, however, only in a few instances. Persons are liable to syphilis repeatedly. One attack does not protect the constitution, as in smallpox, cow- pox, &c. 7>™ W.-Surgeons have naturally directed their atten- tion to the specific nature of syphilis, to the peculiar ravages that it causes locally, to its effect in interrupting health for months or years, and finally weakening the constitu- tion. They have looked for a specific remedy, for something possessnig, or supposed to possess antisyphilitic virtues, that is, capable of counteracting the effects of the morbid poison and thus of checking and eradicating the disease. The^ have beheved that mercury possesses such power, and there

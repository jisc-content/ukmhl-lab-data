TETANUS. 307 their effects, we should feel totally at a loss for any principle to guide us in the treatment of this affection. It appears to me that those cases have done hest in which active aperients have been administered from time to time, so as to remedy the state of costiveness which exists at the commencement of the disease, and to prevent its recurrence, and in which at the same time opiates have been employed to mitigate the severity of the spasm. In some instances successful results have been procured by acting steadily on this plan. The points of treatment, therefore, on which I place reliance myself are, first, the free exhibition of aperient medicines, particularly the croton oil, most convenient from its activity in so small a dose and the consequent facility of adminis- tration, in order to unload the canal in the first instance and afterwards to prevent reaccumulation, and the use of such narcotics as may be sufficient to procure ease by controlling the spasms. Half a dram of laudanum, with or without a dram of the tincture of hyoscyamus, will generally be suf- ficient when the bowels have been evacuated, a fresh dose being administered as soon as the influence of the former on the spasms has ceased. In an exceptional case, such as that of a robust person with a full and strong pulse, a venesection in the first instance might be of service. Some years ago I was called to a case of tetanus under circumstances of imminent danger, where this plan of treat- ment was completely successful.

The attack of tetanus occurred in the hottest time of the year. He was riding, when the horse fell, throwing him forwards, and his face came on the ground, so as to graze the dorsum of the nose, making a slight wound. He thought so little of the

TETANUS. 309 pletely. This was followed by relaxation of the rigid muscles and considerable relief of all the symptoms, but the complaint went on, and proceeded to the full development of tetanus over the whole body. The treat- ment of the case from this time consisted in the regular administration every day of croton oil, so as to ensure free action of the bowels. In the first instance a single drop pro- duced this effect, but after some time it was necessary to give a drop and a half. The evacuations that were produced by this medicine were very copious indeed, and it was observed by the medical gentleman in attendance that "we had got the secret in reference to tetanus." The muscles that before were rigidly contracted became comparatively relaxed at the time. The tetanic affection, however, proceeded until all the voluntary muscles became affected to as high a degree as I ever saw. The patient lay frequently for a considerable time with the limbs completely rigid, and then would have attacks of the most severe convulsions. It was necessary to exhibit opium, in order to control the attacks of spasm. Although in instances where opium has been trusted to alone it has failed to produce this effect, moderate doses in this case would suspend the paroxysms of convulsion for some hours, when it was necessary to repeat the dose. The use of opium in tetanus is not confined to the adminis- tration of the tincture, the solid drug, or morphine. The latter substance has been appbed in powder to the surface of the skin over the vertebral column, previously denuded by bHstering, I believe, without any particular advantage. The rapid and effectual manner in which the hypodermic in- jection of this remedy removes the severest pains without any injurious influence on the head or stomach strongly recommends its use in some cases of tetanus. The violence of the spasms has, in some instances, been controlled by

FEMALE BEEAST. 605 to allow of the air being taken in a carriage. I was aware that diseased parts had been left in the axilla and neighbour- in"- side of the chest, as the condition of the patient would not have allowed the prolongation of the operation by what would have required careful dissection, and the exposure of a region which it is always desirable to avoid. The parts thus left seemed to come forward towards the surface, and were thus accessible in two minor operations, on April 23rd and May 27th; and a more considerable proceeding under chloro- form was necessary on July 19th. The entire wound was com- pletely closed by July 31st; and I had the pleasure of meeting the patient with perfect recovery of health, strength, and good looks, at the Exhibition of 1851, in August. She says that her health has been better since the operation than before, and the cicatrix, which I have seen within the present month (October, 1862), is in a perfect state. The enormous stinking mass removed by the operation was too much disorganized for satisfactory examination, but it presented the usual appear- ances of medullary disease, and had undoubtedly been entirely of that structure. The portions subsequently removed were of light pink colour, very soft, and closely resembling foetal brain. The same kind of soft structure in small portions sprung up repeatedly in the part of the wound nearest to the axilla during its healing, so as to retard the process of cicatri- zation. This occurred not less than ten times. I scooped these out carefully with the end of a director, when not larger than a filbert, and rubbed the exposed surface thoroughly with nitrate of silver. There must have been in the case of this lady a strong dis- position to malignant disease. An elder sister died some years before my attendance, without having undergone opera- tion, of disease in the breast with all the characters, as clearly described to me, of medullary cancer.

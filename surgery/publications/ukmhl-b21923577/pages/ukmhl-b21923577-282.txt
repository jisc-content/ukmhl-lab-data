A silk drawn through the mouth of a rabid dog, and then placed as a seton, in the nape of a healthy dog, will impart the disease to one or two in six. (Ibid.) In fifty-nine inoculations, partly with saliva, partly with blood injected into the cellular tissue, rabies was pro- duced fourteen times, that is, in 24 per cent. ('Edin. Journal/ vol. xxxii, p. 388.) The bites may take effect either on covered or naked parts. In the latter case the disease will probably be produced, unless proper means of prevention are resorted to j while in the former, the teeth are freed from the poisonous matter by passing through the dress, and inflict no injury beyond the mere wound. The wound inflicted by a rabid animal exhibits no peculiarity; the local appearanee, the progress, the repara- tion and healing are the same as in a bite by a healthy dog. A more or less considerable interval elapses between the injury and the appearance of the disease, that is, the hydro- phobia, rabies, or madness. The terrible malady is analogous in this respect to smallpox, cowpox, scarlatina, and syphilis, the interval not being regular, and nearly defined, as in the three former; but indefinite, as in the latter. The most common time of commencement is from the thirtieth to the fortieth day; say five to seven weeks; it is some- times earlier than the first, often later than tbe last. In a large number of cases collected by a society, the time varied from thirty-one days to seventeen months. Dr. I. Hunter considers seventeen, and Dr. Hamilton nineteen months, as the longest well authenticated intervals. The latter mentions eleven days as the earliest period. The two long dates above mentioned deviate so widely from the ordinary course of experience on the subject, that strong evidence would be required to establish their correctness.

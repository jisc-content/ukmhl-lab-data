This may be seen occasionally, when a bruised flap of scalp which has granulated is brought in apposition with a granulating surface of the head. So strong is the disposition to union, that we are unable to prevent it when a granulating surface of the eyelid is in contact with a similar surface of the eyeball, and thus accretion of the lid to the eye, constituting symblepharon, inevitably results. Some amount of exposure is necessary for granulation; entire abscesses and sinuses do not granulate. The superficial, when exposed, granulate most easily; when they extend deeply, the disposition to this process is lessened. Hence arises the necessity of keeping the edges of an incision apart when we wish to insure healing from the bottom. Granulation has been said to be a property of the cellular texture, but I question whether it is so exclusively. As this structure enters into the composition of all organs, it is diffi- cult to determine the point. Granulation is certainly most active where the cellular texture is the most abundant, as in wounds or burns, where the subcutaneous stratum is exposed. Too exuberant granulation is termed in common language proud flesh. When the chasm of an ulcer, or the exposed sur- face left by the separation of a slough, or that of a wound, abscess, or fistula, is filled up, a smooth pellicle forms over the surface at the edge of the sound skin; the granulations shrink, the secretion of pus ceases. This pellicle gradually extends from the circumference to the centre, till the whole surface is covered. This constitutes the cicatrix or scar, aud the process is called cicatrization. A cicatrix is at first thm, red, delicate, and easily torn: it gradually becomes white and strong, and may even be firmer than the original skin. Although always sufficiently answering the purpose of resto-

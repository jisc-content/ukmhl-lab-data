21G MOETIFICATION. of mortification, but in all phagedenic and sloughing ulcers. The chloride of lime exposed in flat dishes is in domestic use as a disinfectant, and will sweeten the air of an apart- ment. A solution of this, and also of the chloride of soda, is sold under the name of bleaching and disinfecting liquids, and they appear in the London Pharmacopoeia under the names of liquor calcis chloridi, and liquor sodse chlorinatse, respectively. When properly diluted, they may be sprinkled on external dressings and bed-linen to destroy offensive smells. Although charcoal and the chlorides are perfectly effica- cious in destroying unpleasant effluvia and in preventing the progress of putrefaction in the altered part, they do not, I believe, impede the extension of the process ; that is, they are not to be regarded as antigangrenous in the proper sense of the word. Applications to the part which has perished are obviously unavailing, while incisions for the purpose of allowing reme- dies to reach more deeply, could not be otherwise than in- jurious. If the surrounding structures are still actively inflamed, soothing local means, with appropriate general management, will be most likely to check the progress of the mischief. The internal treatment has too frequently been directed by the same views as the external, and has consisted in the free use of stimuli, of cordials and tonics, more particularly bark, and of full diet. Bark, long supposed to have sovereign powers in gangrene, is now found to have no such in- fluence. In many cases tonics and stimuli with strong diet are obviously inadmissible. Mortification may occur in states of general power not only different from each other but almost opposite in character.

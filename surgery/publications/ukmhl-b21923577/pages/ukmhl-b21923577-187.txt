CHEONIC ABSCESS. 167 characterised as serous, usually more or less turbid, some- times like whey, sometimes of a brownish, tint or dirty hue. Sometimes the fluid is entirely of this thin serous or whey- like character, hence the name of lymphatic tumours, under which these collections have been described. In this serous or lymphatic fluid there is generally an admixture of flakes or shreds of various sizes. They are either soft or curdy, or tough and fibrous, sometimes spoken of as consisting of lymph; the soft ones may be so, but not the large fibrous and cellular masses, which are often seen. The matter may be thicker and yellower, but then it is flaky or curdly, and not homogeneous like good pus. Sometimes in evacuating a chronic abscess we find the upper part of the fluid thin and serous, the lower portion purulent, having subsided from its greater specific gravity. When we see a swelling forming without heat and pain, and containing an almost watery fluid, we may hesitate in regarding it as the result of inflam- mation, and in giving to such fluid the same name as that which belongs to the very different production resulting from active inflammation; but there is a gradual transition from theseto the most acute cases. If any doubt could be entertained on this point, it would be removed when we see that if active inflammation supervenes in a case of chronic abscess, from which a watery fluid hardly recognisable as matter has been previously discharged, the secretion assumes the character of pus such as might come from a phlegmonous suppuration. This occurred in the following case, which illustrates strikingly the interesting peculiarities under which chronic abscesses are occasionally seen : Case. A person of spare habit, twenty-six years of aÂ°-e and accustomed to close occupation as an engraver, previously healthy and moderately strong, had pain in the back in

TETANUS. 301 considered that wounded persons were in no danger from this alarming malady after twenty-two days. It is more common in hot than in cold climates, but is not a frequent com- plication. In the Schleswig-Holstein war Stromeyer had only sis cases in a list of 2000 wounded. In the Hotel Dieu, in July, 1830, they had but one case of tetanus among the 390 patients wounded by gunshot. During the war in the Crimea its infrequency was remarked. Mr. Macleod knew of only six cases which occurred in camp, and of seven at Scutari ('Notes on the Surgery of the Crimean War/ p. 153). Of the former, one followed a compound fracture of the thigh, one a face wound with destruction of the eye, one an ampu- tation at the shoulder, one a flesh wound of the leg, and the other two occurred in wounds of the thigh without fracture. Sudden vicissitudes of temperature have been looked upon as powerful causes of tetanus, especially the change from a hot day to a cold and damp night. Such was the case in India after the battles of Ferozepore and Chillian- wallah, when the wounded lay exposed to cold nights after days of great exertion under a burning sun. The same fact was noticed by Larrey in the German campaign of 1809. The prevalence of tetanus, both idiopathic and traumatic, in hot climates, and particularly in the West Indies, where heat is looked upon as a predisposing and exciting cause, has been noticed by Sir Gilbert Blane, who remarked that of 810 wounded men who came under his observation in that part of the world in 1782, thirty were seized with tetanus, and seventeen died; while the influence of the opposite con- dition, that of extreme cold, was noticed by Dr. Kane, who tells us that while most of his party were more or less affected, he lost two men from an " anomalous spasmodic affection allied to tetanus, and that all his dogs perished from a like cause."

TONGUE. 0°* Cancer of the tongue.—This shows itself under some varieties of form, all of them" equally unfortunate in the certainty of their progress to a fatal termination. The most common is a firm, scirrhous induration, gradually developed on the edge of the organ, becoming ulcerated more or less deeply, and making its way in the muscular substance to the middle line, or further; it attacks the apex less frequently. It is generally confined to a part; but it may extend along the whole edge. There may be an irregular warty or granulated surface, red and fissured, and slightly prominent, but not ulcerated. In twelve or eighteen months, it may advance from a slight warty projection to a mass occupying half the organ, or more. It is painful, but not always equally so; the pain is often severe, described as shooting or burning. As the disease advances, the tongue becomes so hard and stiff that it cannot be protruded from the mouth, nor moved in mastication, articulation, and swallowing, without con- stantly increasing pain and difficulty, with aggravation from pressure against the teeth and contact with them in its motions, especially if there are ragged, sharp, or pointed parts. The ulcer may be somewhat superficial, but it is more generally excavated, with an uneven and sometimes broken surface, the basis and irregular sides being a thick mass of scirrhus, contrasting strongly with the natural softness of the tongue. Small portions of the ulceration may give way by sloughing, and more or less considerable bleedings may take place. Sometimes the disease is confined at the outset to the mucous membrane, of which a portion larger than a shilling becomes thickened and superficially ulcerated. The basis has a firm feel, but does not seem to involve the muscular structures. This may come on the smooth lateral part of the organ, and is not attended with much pain. It pro-

45 I CLINICAL LECTURE. He was first admitted into the hospital on the 19th of May, 1836, with a phagedenic ulcer of the prepuce, by winch the upper half, or two thirds of the part, had been destroyed to the basis of the glans. The ulcer had an irregular, ragged surface and edge, small portions of the latter being W| there was no appearance of reproduction. The discharge was thin and ichorous; not abundant nor offensive. There was not much pain. The ulcer had existed eight weeks during which time he had taken twelve pills, and employed a lotion, which caused considerable pain. A few large, brownish-red, cutaneous tubercles had appeared recently on the forehead and face. He was directed to take two grains of calomel, with one third of a grain of opium, three times daily, and to apply the black wash to the sore. He continued this treatment till the 6th of June, when the mouth had become considerably affected; he then left off the calomel and opium, and took five grains of the blue pill every night During this time he was kept in bed, and confined to milk diet Under this plan the ulceration was quickly arrested, and the sore, which had been spreading for eight weeks, healed rapidly, the tubercular eruption disappeared from the face. The original sore, however, did not heal completely at the xaiddle of the dorsum penis, where the ulceration had ex- tended a little under the integument; it continued to burrow in this direction after it had cicatrized soundly elsewhere, and at last extended so far that it was necessary to lay open the undermined skin by a free incision, on the 13th of June. The unhealthy surface thus exposed was dressed successively with black wash and with the balsam of Peru. The sulphate of quinine, and the compound decoction of sarsaparilla, were administered internally. The patient left the hospital m the middle of July, freed from the local complaints, and m excellent health.

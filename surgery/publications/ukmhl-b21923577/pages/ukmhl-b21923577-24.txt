4 INTRODUCTION. science were confined to the members of the ecclesiastical profession, to whom we are indebted for preserving those imperfect remains of ancient literature and arts which we still possess. The exercise of medicine harmonised very well with the immediate objects of their holy calling. After the council of Tours, held in 1163, had declared that the Church abhors the shedding of blood (ecclesia abhorret a sanguine), priests and monks were obliged to desist from all curative proceedings that involved loss of blood. These were taken up by barbers, attendants on baths, itinerants, and mounte- banks. In course of time, surgery, which then consisted merely of bleeding, tooth-drawing, and a few other simple processes, became, with the art of the barber, the occupation of a class of men who were legally incorporated in this and other countries, under the title of barber-surgeons. The separation of surgery, or one branch of treatment, from that medical knowledge which is the indispensable guide to the time and mode of its application, and its asso- ciation with the art of the barber, long outlived the circum- stances which produced them. In England it lasted till the middle of the last century, when the Company of Barber- Surgeons was legally extinguished, in the reign of George II. The union of the two callings still exists in some parts of Europe. In order to judge whether there is any well-grounded difference between physic and surgery, it is necessary to advert shortly to the nature of medical science and practice generally. The numerous individual organs which make up the human body, although various in structure and office, are all intimately connected and mutually dependent. They are merely subordinate parts of one great machine, and they all concur, each in its own way, in producing one general

522 CAUSES—DIAGNOSIS—AGE. without attracting the patient's notice, and may go on for months without causing uneasiness in the part or the slightest interruption of health, it proceeds more or less slowly but regularly to involve nearer and more remote parts, thus under- mining the constitution and establishing that general and painful unsoundness of constitution or cachexia from which death may be regarded as a welcome release. It must, there- fore, be considered throughout as a constitutional malady.

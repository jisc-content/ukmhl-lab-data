10 INTRODUCTION. between what we call local and general diseases, is merely in degree, not in kind: it is a difference of more or less. If we were to arrange diseases in one column, beginning with the most local, and ending with the most general, we should fill up the interval with others forming an insensible transition between the two extremes. Where could we draw the line across, to divide surgery and physic, on a scale thus con- structed ? Reverting to the nature and extent of the duties which originally constituted the occupation of the surgeon, and looking to the etymological import of the term, which is manual operation, it has been contended that surgery should embrace those cases only in which operations or other manual aid are required. Thus it has been represented, that the province of surgeons is to administer to external ailments; and that among their rules of conduct is included the nega- tive duty of prescribing no internal remedy whatever. Such notions are worthy of the ignorance to which the separation of surgery and physic owes its origin, and of the dark period in which it occurred. Thus this important professional dis- tinction would rest, not on any essential difference in the causes or nature of disease, or in the principles of treatment, but on the accidental and often varying circumstances of the means employed for their cure. What are we to do with the numerous cases, such as serious inflammations, affections of the head, various gouty and rheumatic diseases, in which change of diet and internal remedies are necessary, in con- junction with topical applications, or with the surgical operations of bleeding, cupping, leeching, scton or issue? How shall we dispose of those, in which these different modes of proceeding become necessary in succession; for example, in retention of urine or hernia? In the latter, a series of manual proceedings, topical applications, and internal ad-

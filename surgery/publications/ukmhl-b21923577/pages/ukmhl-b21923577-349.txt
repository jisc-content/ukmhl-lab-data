SCROFULA. 329 given rather freely, or in the scsquicarbonate of ammonia usually combined with vegetable infusions. The former may be taken in infusion of orange peel or sound beer. The iodide of potassium has been strongly recommended in the treatment of scrofulous complaints, for which a French physician, M. Lugol, has regarded it almost in the light of a specific. He employed it in solution, with the addition of iodine (Potassii iodidi gr. x; Iodinse gr. v, Aquae destill. Oj), giving five to ten minims three times daily, and gradually increasing the dose.

Increased activity of nutrition is often evidenced under its employment in children by increase in bulk and weight. The liver oil of other fishes, of the rays particularly, and purified sperm oil, have been found equally beneficial, and there is a doubt whether olive or almond oil would not do as much good.

A child might take a teaspoonful of the fluid extract three times a day, with or without quinine. The administration of mercury is properly discouraged in scrofulous cases, in which, however, its sparing use is not

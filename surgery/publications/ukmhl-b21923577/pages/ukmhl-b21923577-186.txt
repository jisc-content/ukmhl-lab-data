166 CHRONIC ABSCESS. ismal character. There was a fulness behind the first bone of the sternum and the right sternoclavicular articulation attended with strong pulsation. I considered that it might be a dilated artery and watched the case. The swelling gradually came forward and broke, having been a chronic suppuration with strong cyst. A girl was under my care for some months in the hospital with! solid tumour of the ilium, which was suspected to be of osseous or cartilaginous character. In course of time it softened, and proved to be a chronic abscess, upon examining which that curious sensation common to thick-walled cysts containing a moderate amount of fluid was noticed, namely that of a circular depression of bone, with a sharp circumfe- rential rim, such as is felt when fluid blood is extravasated under the scalp. These cases show what mistakes may occur with regard to matter formed with very little previous inflammation; and they afford an important caution, that in any instance, in which you think of extirpating a doubtful tumour, a prehminary puncture should be made. They show you that, in certain cases, though the formation of matter takes place in this in- sensible way, there may be as much condensation in the sur- rounding tissue as to give the feel of a solid body, though in chronic abscesses the cyst is generally thin. In the instance of the gentleman before spoken of, in whom the tumour formed in the neck, and had been there two years, the cyst was so thin, that when the matter was discharged you could not have supposed there had been any swelling at all; one side of the neck appearing just like the other. Another striking point of distinction between chronic and acute abscesses is afforded by the different character of the contents in the two cases. The former contain generally a thin fluid often of nearly watery consistence; it is frequently

ITS EFFECTS AND VAKIETIES. 67 or specific. Common inflammation is that excited by an or- dinary cause in a healthy constitution, e. g., by wound or other injury, in a patient of sound constitution and good health. Specific derives its character from peculiarity of constitution, or of the exciting cause. Peculiarity of constitution or unhealthiness may be either original, that is, natural or congenital, as in scrofula, or ac- quired, as in gout and rheumatism. Peculiarity of cause, is exemplified in syphilis, smallpox, measles, scarlatina, itch, which are produced by one cause only. The diseased processes are the same in specific as in com- mon inflammation; they differ in modifications, these differ- ences being sometimes so slight that it would be difficult to distinguish them by appearances merely. Common inflammation proceeds regularly to some decided effect; as for instance, suppuration, mortification, resolution In some specific diseases there is great irregularity, often sudden disappearance, with reappearance in another part this is caUed metastasis, a Greek word, meaning simply trans- ference. In each specific inflammation there is a tendency to some peculiar change; to ulceration in syphilis; to ulceration and disorganization by tubercular deposition in scrofula Under this head of diversity in kind maybe mentioned differences dependent on the nature of the cause; in which respect inflammation may be distinguished as : Accidental, spontaneous, and symptomatic In the first the symptoms appear quickly or immediately after the application of the cause; they exist in an canal degree; the disorder proceeds regularly to its termination- and commonly produces suppuration or ffario,, terminates by resolution. g^grene, or

GUNSHOT WOUNDS. 215 is small and feeble pulse, with coldness and paleness of the surface, shivering, and even syncope. There may be deadly paleness with general tremor, instant vomiting, and profuse perspiration. These, not inaptly called nervous symptoms, generally go off in two or three hours, especially if a slight stimulus is taken, or under the influence of kind encourage- ment and sympathy. If, however, this constitutional distur- bance or shock should continue, it will lead to an unfavorable apprehension respecting the seat or extent of injury. Although gunshot wounds often bleed less at first than might be expected, there is generally more or less bleeding ; while serious, and even fatal haemorrhage, may ensue from wounds of large arteries, more especially when the vessels are partially divided. When a limb is carried away, the bleeding although profuse at the moment, ceases from the mode in which the coats of the vessel give way successively. The external elastic coat having been violently stretched before it gives wav, contracts and retracts so as to close the end of the vessel more or less completely for the time. The entry of a bullet is an opening, rather smaller than the bullet itself, with the skin bent inwards, while the exit is larger, more ragged, and has the margin everted. Treatment.â€”If the circulation is feeble, and the nervous symptoms are considerable, rest and warmth are necessary, perhaps with stimuli in moderate quantity. Extraneous sub- stances, such as bullets, portions of clothing, splinters, should be removed, if it can be done easily. An incision should be made to remove a bullet, when near the surface, or sticking to a bone from which it could be readily separated. If, however, it were firmly fixed, so that it could not be removed without incisions of some extent and the employment of force it should be left to be loosened by suppuration. If it is not found easily do not persevere in the search; bullets

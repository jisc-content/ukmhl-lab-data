'287 SCALDS AND BURNS. may be said to have answered its purpose well, the burnt parts were sponged with oil of turpentine, warm, then covered with a liniment <af resin ointment and oil of tur- pentine. The dressings, confined by light bandages, were not to be renewed so long as the patient continued comfortable. "When fresh dressings were applied, care was taken not to chill the parts by opening the whole at once, or leaving the parts open. Poultices of linseed or bread are useful when the sepa- ration of sloughs is going on. The large destruction of the skin leaves extensive granulating surfaces, with copious discharge, of which the cicatrization is extremely tedious. When these are painful, powdered chalk or calamine, with some opium, may be strewed over the surface. A good, nutritious diet is necessary to sustain constitutional power. Profuse discharge is sometimes advantageously checked by astringent solutions. Where mortification does not extend through the entire depth of the skin, cicatrization is accom- plished rapidly, as it begins and proceeds over the entire surface at one and the same time; on the other hand, there is exuberant granulation with tardy cicatrization where the skin is wholly destroyed and the injury extends to the subjacent cellular stratum. Here pressure, with escharotics to the elevated margin of the sore are required. When burns with much loss of substance occur in the face, lower jaw, neck and chest, or on the limbs in their flexures, the cicatrices, in proportion as they contract and acquire solidity, displace and alter the form of the moveable parts within their range, so as to cause distressing deformity often with great imperfection of movement. Change in the form and position of the eyelids involves injurious exposure of the eyeball; the entrance of the nostrils may be contracted, with destruction of the alae nasi; the lower lip and the jaw may be

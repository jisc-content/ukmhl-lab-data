GIG MELANOSIS. pigment of the choroid coat, or that of the bronchial glands. The liver was filled with tumours throughout, and the lungs were diseased in the same way; two tubercles were found in the pancreas; there was one in the sternum, one under the pericranium on the top of the head, and a third on the dura mater, under the occipital bone. This case exemplified what has been seen on other occasions, namely, the origination of the complaint in a mole, and the combination in the morbid growth of the melanoid with the ordinary medullary disease, both being equally soft in consistence. I have seen it beginning in the texture of the skin as a dark blue and almost black circular spot, about the size of a split pea, round which other similar spots have gradually â€¢ formed at short distances. A case very remarkable for the number of melanotic tubercles during life, and the still more abundant develop- ment of the disease after death, was treated and examined by Dr. Norris, of Stourbridge, in 1817, being, so far as .I know, the first description of the affection in this country. It is fully detailed in a collection of cases published by him in 1857. The patient, aged fifty-nine, of light hair and com- plexion, was in apparently good health when first seen on account of a deep brown tumour on the abdomen, which had arisen from a mole; it was ulcerated, and discharged a fetid ichorous fluid. Several brown nodules of similar structure had sprung up around it. This tumour, half the size of a hen's egg, was excised, and the part slowly healed. In less than six weeks the tumour began to grow again from tbe surface of the cicatrix, and a great number of livid tubercles appeared around it, forming a mass of disease resembling a large bunch of black grapes, extending completely across the abdomen. The inguinal glands were swollen and tender. Health was tolerably good, and the patient was able to take

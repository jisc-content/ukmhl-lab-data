SYPHILIS. 457 Pil. Saponis c. Opio was increased to seven and a half grains. On the 24th the fumigation was continued once daily, the mouth having become sore, and linctus was ordered for a cough. Under this treatment, the local symptoms and the health improved rapidly; the ulceration of the throat lost its phagedsenic character, and soon healed; the ulcers of the face cicatrized, the swelling of the ulna disappeared, and those of the frontal bone and os mala broke and discharged, the openings subsequently scabbing over.

On] this occasion mercury was only used locally, viz., in the form of cinnabar fumigation; but, as it happens not unfrequently under such circumstances, the specific action of the remedy on the constitution was produced, and ptyalism ensued. The rapid cicatrization of the ulcers in the fauces and in the face, and the corresponding dispersion of the peri- osteal swellings, were probably owing in great measure to this operation of the remedy.

230 INCISED WOUNDS. at the lower edge, where a portion perished. (' Grafe u. Walther's Journal/ B. iv.) A portion of the cranium of a dog was removed with the trephine hy Merrem and replaced, the integuments then closed. The bone united. He did the same in a cat. Professor Walther repeated the experiment in a dog, which was killed a year after. The piece was firmly united; the cranium is in the Museum at Bonn, and is figured in Wiesmann, ' Com- mutatio Physiologica de coalitu partium/ &c. &c, Lipsiae, 1824, which contains a complete collection of facts relating to this subject. The following remarks on the treatment of wounds are equally applicable to those made in surgical operations. The objects are to promote adhesion, and to keep off in- flammation. The edges of the wound must be brought together and kept in contact. The means of doing this are, 1. Adhesive plasters; 2. Sutures; 3. Bandage; 4. Attention to position. Formerly sutures were almost universally employed; in the present century they have been superseded to a con- siderable extent by adhesive plasters, strips of which should be used just sufficient in number and length to bring the sides of the wound together, and to keep them in apposition. It is not necessary to cover the entire surface of the wound. Recollect that these plasters are in themselves irritating, and would probably excite some inflammation and uneasiness if put on an uninjured part. Remember that the occurrence of inflammatory swelling in some degree is probable, when the plasters become tightened, and thus aggravate the mischief. It is of no use to drag the sides forcibly together, when there has been loss of substance; either the plasters give way, or remaining firm, cause inflammation and pain. The part should be left open or covered as lightly as possible. A

CAUSES. * 209 of a noxious atmosphere on wounds and ulcers. The two latter subjects will be considered under ulceration. 4. Cold, intense or long-continued. 5. Circumstances directly and seriously interfering with the circulation. (a) Effectual compression or rupture of the principal artery and vein of a limb ; ligature of the main artery in wound or aneurism. The latter may entirely arrest the circulation and thus cause simple death; it may impede the supply of blood, causing paleness and coldness of the part, which may be removed by warmth and friction; or it may lead to the disturbance of circulation and consequent mortification, partial, or general. (b) Interruption of the circulation, arterial and venous, by general pressure, such as that of the stricture in strangu- lated hernia. This produces distension of vessels, apparent stagnation of the blood, and deep discoloration of the affected parts. (c) Interception of vascular supply, as an occasional effect of other disease. It is in this way that the thinned skin over an abscess or aneurism which has nearly reached the surface may lose its vitality, and that the integuments mortify over the cellular sloughs of phlegmonous erysipelas and car- buncle. 6. Violent inflammation. These external causes do not produce mortification as their immediate and primary effect. They excite and disturb the circulation, inducing a degree of disorder which the parts are incapable of sustaining . hence the blood stag- nates, and mortification ensues. The arrest of the circulation 1S owing m certain cases to the violence of the inflammation But mortification frequently occurs from a degree of in- 14

548 EPITHELIAL CANCER. altered in texture, surrounded it so completely that until a section of the mass was made I did not know it to be a dis- tinct tumour : it seemed to be a hard mass of fat. The process of repair went on so favorably that the surface was granu- lating healthily, and cicatrization was beginning on the tenth day, when the patient was able to leave London and take a day's journey home. The operation was performed in June, 1826. I saw him again in November, when I found a firm and sound cicatrix, without any susceptible subjacent indura- tion. The gland under the jaw was larger, but less defined. At the end of June in the following year, I was informed by a gentleman from the neighbourhood of this patient that he was suffering severely from the rapid progress of his disease. There was renewed but not considerable ulceration in the face; great swelling under the jaw, so that it was difficult to open the mouth, and had been necessary to draw teeth for the introduc- tion of food j much pain, and emaciation. Death soon followed. I had occasion to remove a submucous swelling of the cheek, similar to the preceding in size and structure, for a gentleman between fifty and sixty, and one exactly alike for another gentleman a little over thirty. It was necessary in both cases to slit up the cheek, and the swellings were com- pletely removed, although they extended backwards to the ramus of the jaw.

Prom the locality of its origin, and its early progress, the disease in the case of the farmer must be referred to the epi- thelial class of cancers; while the secondary glandular affec- tion and the fatal end, are not different from what is

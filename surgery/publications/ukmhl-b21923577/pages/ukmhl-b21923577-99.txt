TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 79 opening in the circulating system below has the effect of drawing blood from the upper regions, the head or the chest may be relieved by bleeding in the saphena. I am inclined to explain on this principle the marked benefit which I fre- quently see produced by the application of a few leeches on the insteps, say, for instance, three on each side. Bleeding in the jugular vein has been recommended in affections of the head, particularly in children. It is an inconvenient and unsatisfactory proceeding, to which leeching and cupping are far preferable. The blood drawn from a vein, when active inflammation exists in any organ, exhibits the peculiar appearances already mentioned as characters of inflammation. There is slow coagulation, and consequently more complete subsidence of the red particles leaving the fibrine on the superior surface of the clot, free from colouring matter. The stratum of fibrine thus left, which is dense and tough, is often yeUow, hence caUed buffy or buff-coloured. In the process of shrinking, by which the serum is squeezed out of the clot, this upper stratum, consisting of fibrine only, contracts more than the rest of the clot; hence its edge is drawn inwards so as to render the coagulum concave or cupped. The buffy coat and the cupped or concave surface which it presents, are the two circumstances constituting the inflammatory character of the blood, the so-called buffy ov inflammatory coat or crust (crusta inflammatoria or pleuritica). The buffy coat seems to differ from the rest of the crassamentum only in the absence of red particles. Some- times it is an opaque yellow stratum, almost leathery so that it is with difficulty penetrated with a spoon, strongly contracted at the edge, and deeply concave. This state indicates high inflammatory actionj the , yellow, opaque, and tough, the higher the inflammati more tion.

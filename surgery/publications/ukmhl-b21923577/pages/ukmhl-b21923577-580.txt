560 EPITHELIAL CANCER. wound, the pain and other inconveniences are effectually remedied at the time, and some patients have submitted to the operation as a temporary respite from suffering. It may, I believe, be stated as the universal result of experience, that although the tongue remains well, disease occurs in the ab- sorbent glands, under the jaw, and at the side of the neck, often forming very large masses, which may open by a pecu- liar kind of suppuration, yielding either an imperfect pus or a thin discoloured fluid, proceeding to large cancerous exca- vations of broken surface, with abundant ichorous and gene- rally fetid discharge. This renewal of disease takes place more early in cancers of the tongue than in others, sometimes within the year, and seldom after a much longer interval. In one instance, of a patient in St. Bartholomew's, for whom I had removed a circular piece, rather larger than a shilling, of mucous membrane thickened, indurated, and slightly raised, from the upper part of the organ in its anterior loose portion, the affection having been apparently confined to that membrane, there was ultimately the largest cancerous exca- vation under the jaw, and at the side of the neck, that I ever saw. The operation of removing cancerous portions of the tongue cannot be spoken of favorably as a means of per- manent cure, from the result of cases under my own observa- tion. The only case in which it may seem not unlikely that an approximation may have been made to such a result was that of a female of fifty-eight, of spare habit and delicate constitution, who had a small hard knot in the edge of the tongue, unattended with pain. She attributed it to the irritation of a carious tooth, which was forthwith removed. As it continued to increase she came into the hospital under my care. The growth, which had existed about five months, was of the size and shape of a large horse-

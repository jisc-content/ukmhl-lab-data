200 HOSPITAL GANGRENE. and supporting the patients' strength by all the resources of diet and medicine. Delpech treated a hundred and fifty- cases from Pampeluna, all with cautery, and successfully. The nitrate of silver, and even pure potash, are not sufficient for the occasion.* * In the early spring of the present year circumstances occurred at St. Bartholomew's, showing that wounds, even of trivial character, may pass into the sloughing state without having heen exposed to the unfavorable influences described in the preceding pages, and leading to the belief that they must have arisen from some more general but obscure cause. A healthy youth, about twenty, came to the hospital as a casualty patient with a cut on the forearm near the wrist, less than an inch in length, and over the radial artery, which it had not injured. It was properly dressed, and he returned in three days, when it was dressed again, the edges not having united. He came again in three or four days, when I saw him, with a circular sore as large as a half-crown, covered with a dark brownish-black slough; the discharge was a bloody and offensive sanies. He was admitted, and the strong nitric acid was applied with the desired effect, which was only temporary. This was repeated after some days, the result being an exposed surface of formidable aspect more than two inches in diameter, which improved slowly and healed very gradually hut completely, the radial and ulnar arteries being obliterated. A nearly similar case was admitted by one of my colleagues about the same time, and it was found necessary to manage even trivial wounds with great precaution. About the same period three men were brought into one of my wards on the same day, with erysipelas, in so dangerous a state from extreme prostration that the free use of brandy was necessary for some time to rally the circulation and bring them into a state of safety.

407 BUBO. they may be situated. The situation of bubo, therefore, will depend on that of the primary symptom; thus, in the great majority of cases, they occur in the glands situated nearest to the external organs of generation; in those of the groin, at the lower part of the abdomen, at the upper and inner part of the thigh, or at the pubes. They may occur in the axilla from primary sores on the fingers or hand, or on the nipple or areola of the female breast. Primary sores on the lips might give rise to glandular swellings below the lower jaw. The glands below and behind the angle of this bone are frequently enlarged in connection with syphilitic disease of the fauces. I have never seen them in this situation attaining considerable size, proceeding to suppu-r ration, or causing trouble after the throat had got well. The disease may affect a single gland, or more than one, some- times even including the whole range. An absorbent vessel is occasionally but rarely affected, and is felt as a small, rather painful cord on the back of the penis. It gives no trouble. The affection may be in the inguinal or in the femoral glands, or in both; in the latter case there is a double swelling, one above, the other below the bend of the thigh. It may be confined to one side, or exist on both; it may occupy both ranges of glands on both sides. It usually occurs on the same side of the body as the primary affection, but instances are not unfrequent in which it is seen on the opposite side. The disease may be simple enlarge- ment, enlargement with induration, or inflammation more or less active in the two former cases. The swelling is moveable under the skin, and may continue so throughout, the disease not being active, and confined to the gland itself. The inflammation may increase and spread to the surrounding cellular tissue, with interstitial effusion, and consequent thick- ening, by which the separate glands are massed together

Â°"u SCROFULA. powerfully; they arc less able to resist cold and other de- pressing influences. The marks of scrofula may be observed at an early age; they are original and hereditary. The latter term applies to the constitutional disposition, not to the disease. A person of scrofulous constitution may escape disease alto- gether under favorable circumstances and with great care; sometimes, however, all precautions are unavailing. The offspring of scrofulous parents is not necessarily scrofulous ; we often see differences in this respect between the different children of the same family. When both parents are scrofu- lous it is highly probable that the children will have the same constitution; when one parent only is affected, the children may or may not escape. The chances are more unfavorable in marriages of consanguinity. The most powerful among the exciting causes is cold, espe- cially when combined with moisture, exposure to cold winds, with snow and rain, fogs, and great vicissitudes of atmos- pheric temperature. Scrofula, therefore, is most prevalent in cold, damp, and variable climates, such as that of Great Britain, the north of France, and Germany, and the still more northern parts of Europe. The late Professor Beer has stated that in Vienna nine tenths of the ophthalmise of children are scrofulous; Benedict gives a similar proportion for Breslau. The late Dr. Gregory stated in his lectures that there was not a family in Scotland totally exempt from scrofula. An analogous representation is made by M. Guersent, so long the physician of the hospital for sick children in Paris. He says, " We may almost affirm that in our great cities no numerous family will be found in which, on tracing the pedigree upwards and downwards, we shall not meet with phthisical or scrofulous subjects."

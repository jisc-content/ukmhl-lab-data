176 HECTIC FEVER. tion. Hence it has been sometimes called suppurative fever; this is an objectionable name, because suppuration often occurs without such fever, while, on the other hand, hectxc may take place where there is no suppuration. Hectic being a febrile disorder, kept up by a serious local disease, may occur in medical as well as in surgical cases. Pulmonary hectic is nothing peculiar; it is merely this dis- order accompanying disease of the lungs, and it may be found in such disease, as well as in affections of joints, without suppuration. There is a correspondence in nature and degree between local disorders and the general disturbance, which they excite sympathetically. A compound fracture causes violent inflam- mation of the limb, and suppuration; this is attended with inflammatory fever. The formation of matter lessens the dis- turbance. Repeated inflammations and suppurations occur, accompanied with renewed febrile attacks. The strength of the patient is reduced; and now the condition of the limb is altered. The firm swelling of acute inflammation is exchanged for edematous tumefaction; the soft parts are flabby, and a thinner matter is discharged in large quantity from the seat of the various suppurations. This change in the part is accompanied by an analogous alteration in the febrile symptoms. The "patient becomes hectic; his fever mav be said to have become chronic. in hectic, whether it arise from a change in the local symptoms caused by a severe injury, such as a bad compound fracture, from irritation in the cyst of atonic abscess, or from disease in some important organ, such as the longs or a large joint, there is considerable disturbance of the circulation. The pulse is accelerated, rising to 120 or upwards, and going on at that rate for weeks or months. The circulation, how- ever, is variable; the surface generally, and the countenance

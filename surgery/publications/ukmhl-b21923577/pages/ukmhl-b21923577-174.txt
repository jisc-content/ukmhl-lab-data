154 SUPPURATION. thinned and livid integument, which may impede the progress of granulation and cicatrisation. But this inconvenience does not occur when suppurating buhoes are opened at a proper time and in a proper manner. If the seton and caustic have not become completely obsolete, the occasions for their em- ployment must be of the rarest occurrence. Generally we adopt the direct and simple proceeding of puncture, which is the shortest and most effectual means of accomplishing the purpose. Knives of various forms may be used: but perhaps ■the most convenient instrument is a straight, lancet-pointed, and double-edged bistoury. The sharp point and double edge make it enter easily. You may make a simple punc- ture, or, having punctured, run the knife along, so as to extend the opening, when a more ample aperture is needed, as is the case when the skin has become thin, and the col- lection is large. It is best to make the opening, and then let the matter drain out of itself. ■ There is no advantage in squeezing out the whole contents. This is contrary to the course of nature; in spontaneous bursting the aperture is small, and the escape generally gradual; the cyst contracts in proportion as the contents are lessened. Pressure or violence are not only not necessary for discharging the matter, but they give pain and irritate. Still less should you thrust your finger into the abscess, as I have seen done, or introduce instruments of any kind without necessity. Having made the opening, let the matter run out. Cover the part with a fomentation- cloth for half an hour, and then put on a poultice. Since many practitioners are in the habit of puncturing as soon as they find that matter has formed, seeming to regard it as a surgical duty to do so, it is necessary to con- sider the question generally, which of the two proceedings, namely leaving an abscess to its natural course, or dis-

SYPHILIS. 467 important source of additional benefit in this mode of pro- ceding. One half of the glans had perished, and was con- verted into a dark, greyish slough, separated from the living parts by a distinct line. Poppy fomentation and soft bread poultice constituted the local treatment, and the muriate of morphine was given at night to procure rest. On the fol- lowing day he was much better; the division of the prepuce had been followed by immediate and effectual relief to the part, and the opiate had procured a good night. The slough was separating. In two days' time the separation had advanced considerably, leaving a rather foul and ragged surface, to which lint, clipped in the balsam of Peru, was applied. In two days more, the surface had become quite clean, and the balsam was left off, as its application caused pain. Soon after, the mortified part became entirely de- tached; although the slough extended deeply between the glans and the body of the penis, the urethra escaped. The sore now healed rapidly. The measures of general treatment after the prepuce had been divided consisted in a nutritious diet, with porter and wine, and the sulphate of quinine, in two-grain doses, three times a day. No secondary symptoms ensued in this case. This and other analogous cases show that the venereal poison may cause, not only inflammation, increased and altered discharge, thickening and various modifications of ulceration, but also loss of vitality more or less considerable The mortified part is separated by the same process as in other cases the surface left after such separation being per. fectly healthy, and usually granulating and cicatrizing rapidly An ingenious person has written a book to prove "the non exastence of venereal virus." We will not dispute about words; but we may be permitted to ask, if there is no venereal p01son, how it happened that the first and sole

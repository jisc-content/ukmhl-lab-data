30G TETANUS. most powerful of the class. Thus the treatment of tetanus has generally turned, in part at least, on the exhibition of opium. In tetanus the nervous system is less influenced by opium and other antispasmodics than under other circumstances, and thus they have sometimes been borne in very large doses without good or obviously bad effects. Dr. Babington gave 180 grains of opium in eleven honrs, and an ounce of tincture of opium in twenty-four hours. The history of idiopathic tetanus, affords many instances in which the free use of opium has been said to have cured. It has not the same beneficial result in the sympathetic form of the complaint. Bloodletting has been resorted to in tetanus, particularly in the early stage. Patients have been bled largely, and, in some cases, the blood has been buffed and cupped. Hence bloodletting may perhaps be a useful auxiliary remedy in some cases, although, considered alone, it is not capable of accomplishing the purposes we have in view. Mercury has been employed freely, so as to produce saliva- tion, frictions having been employed for this purpose. This does no good; indeed, in some instances tetanus has come on when the patients were under salivation at the time. The powerfully relaxing or depressing effect which tobacco exercises over the nerves and the muscular system has led to the employment of it in the form of clyster. This dangerous remedy has been of no service. Musk, camphor, and ether, have been exhibited in large doses; in fact, all in such doses as are supposed to exert a power over the muscular and nervous system. Bark, wine, tonics, and stimuli of all kinds, have been given very freely. If we were merely to look over the recorded cases ot tetanus, observing the means that have been employed and

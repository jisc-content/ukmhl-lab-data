TETANUS. 305 will the amputation of a finger, a thumb, or any other part, arrest the symptoms, and put a stop to the complaint ? We may, I believe, say confidently that it will have no such effect. Tetanus may occur when a wound is in a healing state, and making rapid progress to a cure. No doubt the complaint owes its origin to some condition of the wound and health prior to this healing state; consequently the removal of the part would be useless. Yet amputation of the extremity in which it may be situated has been pro- posed, even in late times, and by those whose authority is considered high in surgery; more particularly by Larrey, who recommends it in the surgical history of his military campaigns. He, however, adds, that it is only proper in cases of chronic tetanus, or at the very commencement of the symptoms in those of a more acute kind. He adduces but few cases, and even these do not furnish conclusive evidence on the point. It has been tried in some instances without satisfactory results. Perhaps, however, we should not be warranted in condemning it absolutely. There could be no objection to removing a finger, if in a bad and painful state, on the first appearance of alarming symptoms. From the great diversity and even directly opposite plans of treatment which have been and still are resorted to in this disease, we may conclude that no one method has hitherto re- ceived the general assent and sanction of the profession. The extremes include bleeding and purging on one hand, quinine, iron, and diffusible stimuli on the other. Differences in con- stitution and previous health, and the period of the affection, will account for something in this variety, but not for the complete therapeutic contrast, from which we can only draw the conclusion that the pathology of the affection is not yet ascertained. The state of the voluntary muscles has naturally led to the employment of antispasmodics, and especially of the 20

580 FUNGUS HvEMATODES. of pleurisy came on, ascribed to cold, and was treated in the usual manner, with partial recovery. Tumours at length ap- peared and brought him to the grave, worn down by constant irritation, and excruciating agony. Two swellings had formed externally on the left side of the chest, one on the lateral and posterior part, with a sense of fluctuation, and about eight inches in diameter; the other much smaller, over the seventh and eighth ribs, and two inches from the sternum. After death nearly the whole left side of the chest was occupied by a large swelling, with which the lung was in great part con- solidated. This was composed of very thick walls, firm exter- nally, but becoming softer and darker internally, and gradually passing into the dark brown semi-fluid and greasy mass, which formed the whole interior of the tumour. It resembled putrid brain mixed with dark blood, but had no faster, and had caused the sense of fluctuation in the external, which communicated freely with the internal swelling through the fourth and fifth intercostal spaces. About two inches in length of the sixth rib had disappeared, and for several inches before and behind this rib was softened, carious, and divested of periosteum. The smaller tumour was similar to that already described. The two surfaces of the pericardium were closely adherent throughout. Instances in which there appears any reasonable ground for referring the occurrence of fungus nematodes to external causes are insignificant in amount when contrasted with the entire list of cases, and with the still far greater number of bruises, strains, shocks, and indefinite injuries, great and small, which are constantly happening every day and every- where without any serious result whatever. How shall we be able to fathom the cause of diseases arising and pro- ceeding to a fatal termination, as they may, in the first year of the healthiest infants.

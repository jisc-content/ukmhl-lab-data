EYE. G25 swelled, nor apparently altered in structure, in the situation of these deposits. The brain was healthy; there was a small, black spot lying upon the surface of the anterior cerebral lobes under the pia mater. The left optic nerve, from the orbit up to the commissure, was shrunk into a slender membranous cord, without trace of nervous matter; the state of atrophy was continued in a slighter degree along the right, or opposite optic tract, into the optic thalamus. There were five dark-colored, spherical tumours, about the size of nuts, visible through the integuments of the chest, situated chiefly about the right mamma. Three similar tumours were noticed under the integuments of the abdomen; they were loose and seated in the cellular tissue; some were firm and black, others of a brownish hue, consisting of thick fluid contained in a cyst. Black matter was deposited in the cancellous texture of some of the left ribs; a mass of black matter the size of a musket bullet was lodged upon the anterior surface of the dorsal vertebrae. The lungs were healthy. There were numerous black tumours upon the outer and inner surface, and in the muscular substance of the heart; two of considerable size projected into the cavity of the left ventricle. The liver, enormously enlarged, seventeen and a half pounds in weight, occupied the greater part of the abdominal cavity; although much of the surface presented the natural colour, consistence, and organization of the hepatic substance. The enlarged gland consisted principally of a morbid deposit, in larger or smaller masses, which occupied the entire thick- ness of the organ, and projected from the surface in rounded tubercles of various magnitude and generally of black colour. 40

CHAPTER XXI. FUNGUS ELEMATODES. Fungus ELematodes is a disease as intractable and formi- dable as cancer, or ratber more so. Tbe two affections were confounded until a comparatively recent period, tbough tbe difference of consistence is too striking to bave escaped notice altogetber: bence tbis complaint was called soft cancer in the testicle, the only situation in which it had been noticed before tbe beginning of the present century. Tbe late Mr. Hey, who first clearly described the disease, gave it the name of fungus haematodes, because in a certain stage and in some situations it bursts through the skin, when a soft, and frequently bleed- ing fungus, protrudes at tbe opening. It bears other names, which mark its softness, and resemblance to tbe substance of the brain; thus it is the medullary sarcoma of Mr. Abernetby, fungus medullaris; tumeur encephaloide, or cerebriforme of the French. In reference to these names it may be observed that the morbid growth is not always characterised by softness, and tbe bleeding fungus is only an occasional occurrence. In tbis disease there is the growth of a peculiar morbid structure as a new formation or tumour in tbe intermuscular intervals of any part, or its deposition in distinct and circum- scribed masses in tbe substance of any organ.

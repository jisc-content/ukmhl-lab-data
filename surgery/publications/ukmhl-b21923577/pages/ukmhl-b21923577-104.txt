84 TREATMENT OE INFLAMMATION, necessary to go to twelve or even sixteen ounces, the latter quantity being never exceeded. Professor Langenbeck, of Gottingen, says that be never takes more than eight or ten ounces. One cannot help concluding from these representa- tions, either that there must be a great difference in condi- tional power between the English and some Continental nations, or that the inflammatory diseases of the latter are milder and more manageable than our own. It has been objected to the large bleedings which we sometimes find necessary, that they weaken. They cerWy do so in one sense; that is their object. We think that the patient has too much blood, and that the heart is acting too powerfully; that he is too strong, if those circumstances are the criteria of strength. The object, however, is to stop the inflammation, to do it effectually, and at the same time safely. I cannot doubt that these points will be most completely secured by employing active means in an early stage. One large bleeding generally suffices. I never saw a patient labouring under a serious inflammation injured by one vene- section, however large. _ Will it contribute to the patient's strength, to let an inflammation run on for eight or ten days, instead of stopping it in one or two ? On the other plan, the inflammation lasts for several days, and the bleedings go on till the patients vessels are drained; he is brought by the protraction o disease and the repetition of treatment into a state f ^ greatest debility. This method seems to me ing n on contrived for allowing the patient to experience the M debilitating effect, both of the disease and the treaty*â–  } cannot doubt that a large bleeding in the beginning only the most efficacious, but the most economical mode proceeding as respects the patient's strength* * On the 9th of November . young -man applied to me, at the out-

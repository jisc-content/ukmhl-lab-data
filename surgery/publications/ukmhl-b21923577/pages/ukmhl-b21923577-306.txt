286 SCALDS AND BURNS. When suppuration begins in scalds and burns, the con- stitutional excitement is sometimes so considerable as to require salines, with antimony and nitre, together with mild regimen. Local means.â€”-To structures actually disorganized appli- cations can be of no service. Yet even such parts and the entire body should be covered warmly, to prevent chilliness. Cotton-wool is now recognised as the best application for the injured parts and their neighbourhood, its use having been suggested in America by the accidental circumstance of a badly burnt child having been placed on an emergency in a basket of cotton, with which it soon became covered, and then quiet. A tolerably thick layer of the wool should be placed on the burnt or scalded part, and lightly confined by suitable bandages. It completely answers the two im- portant purposes of preserving the heat and taking off pressure from the prominent points in the various attitudes of the body. When this kind of dressing has been properly applied and a suitable stimulus administered, the patient soon becomes easier. He remains at perfect rest, the covering not requiring renewal or change possibly for weeks, at all events not so long as he feels comfortable. If discharge should appear at any point, a little wool may be added in that situation, or a partial renewal of the covering may be advi- sable. The separation of eschars, and the repair of the surfaces often go on most favorably on this plan, by which the severe suffering from the renewal of dressings and the exposure to the air of extensive denuded and sensitive sur- faces is entirely avoided. The treatment by cotton has nearly superseded a method in very general use previously, Waving been introduced by Mr. Kentish of Newcastle, who had seen much of the worst burns in the collieries of that district. In this plan, which

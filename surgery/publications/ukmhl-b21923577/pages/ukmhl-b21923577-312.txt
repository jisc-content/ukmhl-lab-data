The great disadvantage is in the extremely severe pain attendant on the process. A violent disturbance is excited in the part and neighbourhood, with vivid redness, sense of heat and burning almost intolerable, equally uncontrollable by warm or cold applications, though the latter, including iced water or freezing mixtures, are, perhaps, the most serviceable.

Of late years the cancer curers have substituted this chloride for the dangerous arsenical preparations formerly employed.

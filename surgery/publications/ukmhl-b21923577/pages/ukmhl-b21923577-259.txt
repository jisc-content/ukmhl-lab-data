UNION BY ADHESION. 239 treatment of incised wounds were made a general question, my answer would be in favour of tlie former. The object is to unite the edges, and maintain them in contact by means incapable of fretting the wound itself, or of irritating the surrounding parts. Plasters, particularly the common adhesive, which are irritating, press closely on the very edges of the wound, and cover the surrounding integuments to a greater or less extent. When removed at the end of two, three, or more days, the edges of the wound are found red- dened and discharging, and the neighbouring skin is heated and itching. When a wound has been united partly by sutures and partly by plasters, the former portion will soon be completely healed without any redness or discharge, while the latter is superficially inflamed and suppurating. While the silver wire, or small firm silk, holds the edges well together without irritation, the wound itself and the neighbouring parts are left open, or covered by a damp cloth to prevent heat or swelling. I have spoken of interrupted sutures, which may not unite the wound with sufficient firmness on all occasions. Being once on a visit in the country, I was called to see a boy who had been attacked in the yard of a neighbouring inn, and seriously wounded, by a boar. There was a large rent in the abdominal parietes, through which a portion of the stomach and omentum, with some intestines, had protruded. These parts were returned without difficulty, but the belly was then obviously over full, particularly as the stomach was partially filled with a meal recently taken. As the occurrence of vomiting sooner or later was most probable, and that of peritonitis almost inevitable, it seemed likely that compress and bandage would do more harm than good, and that they could not be borne. I therefore united the wound firmly by the uninterrupted suture. This mode of dealing with the

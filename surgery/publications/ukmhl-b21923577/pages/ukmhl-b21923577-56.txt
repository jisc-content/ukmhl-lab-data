36 THE NATTJBE AND common observation, that diseases which we meet with in nature are very little like those we read of in books. Thus the primary grounds of distinction, so clear and definite m animals and plants, arc altogether wanting in diseases, to which the name of species cannot be applied in the same sense as in natural history. Again, the structure and economy of animals being well known, leading circumstances can be adopted as the ground of their distribution into genera, classes, and orders, so that from the position of an animal m such an arrangement, you understand the principal points m its economy before you are acquainted with the animal itself. This advantage is altogether absent in the case of diseases. All the subjects either in the animal or vegetable kingdom might be arranged in a single line, beginning with the most simple and ending with the most complicated, or vice versd. Diseases are so imperfectly distinguished and so in- termingled, that they would form a sort of network, instead of a single line. Cullen's nosology, therefore, can afford no assistance in acquiring a knowledge of the nature and re- lations of diseases, and the task of learning what is useless and deceptive ought not to be imposed on students. As diseases consist of changes in the state of organs, the proper ground of distinction would be anatomy; at all events, this would not involve any error. There are two things to be considered here, the anatomy of form and position, and that of texture. The one is called descriptive, the other general anatomy. The latter shows the compo- sition of the organs : it is a kind of analysis, reducing them into their constituent elements. Bichat, a Frenchman of ex- traordinary genius, who died at the age of thirty-three, leaving behind him a great name, has explained the anatomy of structure. He has attempted to reduce, in a work called < Anatomie Generale/ the organs of the body to their compo-

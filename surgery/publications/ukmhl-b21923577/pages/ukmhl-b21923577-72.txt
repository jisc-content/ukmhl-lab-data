52 INFLAMMATION, of inflammation are attended by increased activity of the circulating system in the affected part. The redness and preternatural heat are obviously accounted for by this view. The redness by the increased quantity of blood, and the in- creased heat on the same principle. The heat of the body certainly depends principally on the changes produced in the blood in passing through the lungs; and when a larger quantity of that fluid is sent into, and circulates through, any part, it will obviously follow, that the temperature of that part must be increased, but still it, never rises above the natural heat of the blood. The swelling is to be accounted for partly by the turgescence occasioned by the general dis- tension of the blood-vessels, and partly by the interstitial deposition. The pain will be readily explained by the cir- cumstance of the nerves participating, as well as all other parts, in the general disturbance. It has been a disputed point whether the pressure of the turgid vessels upon the nerves caused the pain, or the irritation of the nerves gave rise to the vascular turgidity; it is a question of little moment, and which scarcely admits of a positive answer. The constitutional symptoms are to be regarded as sym- pathetic effects produced by the state of the inflamed part; and here we see that the local disturbance acts equally on the vascular, nervous, digestive, and secreting systems; they are all equally affected. Of these sympathetic affections another view may be taken; we may suppose, and some of the phe- nomena would seem to convey that view, that the disturbance of the circulation of the part is communicated to the rest of the vascular system, and thus accounts for the affections of the digestive and nervous systems and of the secretions. Examination of inflamed parts after death shows clearly how the various tissues have suffered. There is increased redness of all the textures, the vessels being larger and ap-

SLOUGHING PHAGEDENA. 195 sarily so. I have seen it only in prostitutes and generally in those of the lowest description, and I have not met with it in men. The predisposing cause of the affection is an unhealthy state of constitution in young and naturally healthy, but often delicate females, who lead a miserable life of prostitution in the worst parts of London, with little protection from the coarseness and ill-usage of the lowest characters. They are constantly intemperate, especially in the use of spirits, and exposed to cold, wet, fatigue, and broken rest.

It consists of disorganized tissues

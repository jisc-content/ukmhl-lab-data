NOSE —TESTICLE—EAR—LARYNX. 429 testicle had been swelled and then got better a few months previously. When I saw bini the tumour was large, slightly red, and painful on pressure; there was fluid in the tunica vaginalis, which it was subsequently necessary to evacuate by puncture; it did not reaccumulate. Blue pill was admin- istered carefully, being sometimes discontinued. The swelling of the testicle gave way very slowly, and had not entirely disappeared till after several months.

Another attack of iritis and five of sore throat occurred subsequently, and, lastly, soft periosteal swellings of the frontal bone and over the ossa nasi.

The larynx may be affected with inflammation and ulcera- tion, extending into the glottis from the throat; it is a case of urgent danger, only to be averted by rapid mercurialization. Mr. Carmichaelsays that he never witnessed a recovery when the larynx was decidedly attacked by ulceration. Chronic

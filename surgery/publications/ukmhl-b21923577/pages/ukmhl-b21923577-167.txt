147 SUPPURATION. regarded as a criterion to distinguish it from mucus. Great pains have been taken to establish the distinction, particularly in reference to expectorations, but diagnosis is not always successful. Under ordinary circumstances, there is no risk of confounding the two fluids. Pus has no viscidity, and easily blends with water. Mucus is ropy, slimy, and not miscible with water. While pus sinks, mucus floats; but this is not constant; the tough mucus from the inflamed bladder sinks, even in the mine. The ordinary, or even the slightly altered secretion of mucous membranes is not likely to be confounded with the produce of suppurative inflammation. But under high inflammation mucous membranes secrete a fluid closely resembling pus; and I know of no certain dis- tinction. It is not a point of any material practical import- ance. Pus is secreted or effused through the pulpy surface of the abscess; it is a morbid product from vessels disturbed by inflammatory excitement, as ordinary secretions and nutri- tive deposits are the regular offspring of vessels in their nor- mal state. It is not produced by fermentation or concoction of the fluids; nor does it result from a breaking down or melting of the solids. The latter notion has probably arisen from observing the cavity which contains the matter. There is a large excavation, an apparent loss of substance; the notion might well arise that parts had disappeared and had been converted into pus. There is really no loss of sub- stance. The textures surrounding the matter are merely pushed aside and swelled; the natural form and bulk of the part are restored when the disease has come to an end. Yet there is something like a breaking down of the natural textures in the commencement of phlegmonous abscess There is not only a softened state of the parts, but actual

405 PETMARY SORES. symptoms was not greater than one in twenty. In 1940 cases treated on the non-mercurial plan in the army, there were 96 instances of secondary symptoms, that is, about one in twenty, taking cases of all descriptions. In 2827 cases treated with mercury, there were only 51 instances of secon- dary symptoms; that is, one in 55; the clear inference being that the employment of mercury for primary sores has a marked influence in preventing the occurrence of secondary symptoms. I cannot adduce any experience of my own that approaches in extent and accuracy to that just detailed. The result of my own observation is, that very few instances of secondary symptoms occur when these primary sores have been treated with mercury. I therefore adopt in the primary sores now under consideration a mild mercurial treatment, such as three or four grains of the gray powder three times a day, or four or five grains of blue pill twice or three times daily, with black wash to the part; a quiet mode of living, and light diet, without stimuli. Under this treatment the mouth is slightly touched. The local means may be varied if necessary by employing nitrate of silver or sulphate of copper in solution. In the treatment of indurated chancres the use of mercury is considered more particularly necessary, and it is carried further than in other cases. It is equaUy required whether the induration existed originally, or has come on subsequently, also if it remains after the sore is healed. The patient cannot be considered safe so long as the hardness remains, and the remedy should therefore be continued until it is dis- persed. This effect may be hastened by the application of mercurial ointment to the part. Cicatrization of the sore, and then absorption of the hardness, take place favorably mder the use of mercury generally and locally. A patient in St. Bartholomew's had a small and not deep

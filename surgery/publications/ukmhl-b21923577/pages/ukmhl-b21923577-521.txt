CHAPTER XX. CANCER. The affections hitherto described, with few exceptions, are curable; being attended in many instances with great tem- porary disturbance of the part affected, and often with more or less serious disorder of other parts; but they go through a certain course, subside, and come to an end, leaving the seat of disease in a natural state, or variously altered, still however not interfering further with health in other respects, and thus not endangering life. I pr0ceed to speak of diseases, which entirely change or destroy the structure of the affected organs, spread to all the parts around, and cause, sooner or later, the development of secondary diseases in remote organs, deeply impairing constitutional power, and ultimately destroying life. These bear the formidable name of malignant diseases, which denotes but too truly their dan- gerous character. Cancer, fungus nematodes, and melanosis, agree in pos sessing this destructive character, both as regards their primary seat and the life of the patient. This has led not unnaturally, to their being described together as various forms of one disease in the article « Cancer," of the 'Diction naire de Medecine/ (en 21 t.), by Breschet and Ferrus • and the same course is followed by Eecamier, in his 'Recherches sur le traitement des Cancers/ published in 1829

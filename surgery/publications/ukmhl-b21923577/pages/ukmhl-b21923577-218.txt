198 HOSPITAL GANGRENE. name of phagedena gangrenosa. By the terms hospital sore, putrid, contagious, malignant, scorbutic ulcer, the same, or analogous affections are denoted. It is a most unhealthy and rapidly destructive condition of ulcers, whether the result of wounds, sores, or ulceration, produced by local causes; appearing in hospitals, prisons, barracks, shops, when filled with bad surgical cases in un- healthy situations, particularly of elevated temperature. The crowding of human beings within a small space is always unfavorable to health, as we see in the occupants of small and overfilled apartments, in the narrow streets and courts of large cities. A noxious influence, of which we do not know the exact nature, is generated under such circumstances. In the ward of an hospital, calculated to hold fifteen or sixteen persons, twenty were sometimes placed when applications were more numerous than usual. It was soon noticed that typhus fever invariably broke out on such occasions. In large hospitals filled with serious diseases, especially ex- tensive wounds and ulcers, when ventilation is not good, the effect is obvious in many ways; in the prevalence of erysipelas, in the unfavorable result of operations, and in the change produced in wounds and ulcers previously healthy. It is clearly ascertained that, for the favorable treatment whether of medical or surgical cases, and of the latter more particularly, when wounds, ulcers, and operations are included, an hospital ward should offer, at least, a thousand cubical feet of atmosphere for each bed, and that an allowance of fifteen hundred feet would be still better. Hospital gangrene is the local effect of a vitiated atmosphere on the surface of a wound. More general disturbance ensues, as a secondary consequence. In a case which has been previously going on favorably the part becomes painful and hot, the edges are inflamed, suppuration stops, and a serous

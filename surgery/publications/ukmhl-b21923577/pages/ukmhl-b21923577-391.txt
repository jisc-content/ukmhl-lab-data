INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF MERCURY. 371 cautiously administered, its effects, with the amount and number of doses, not being duly watched, this remedy may act prejudiciously on the system, producing effects which are in themselves a kind of disease, sometimes a serious one, requiring appropriate treatment. It may affect the mouth, producing excessive salivation; and I do not know a more painful condition than that of an individual in whom this takes place. The tongue becomes swelled, excessively sore, excoriated on the surface and edges, and presses against the teeth on each side, so that indentations are observed on the margin of the organ.

The quantity of the discharge, under such circumstances, is beyond what I have already mentioned; frequently a quart of saliva, or more, flows from the mouth in the course of a night.

He recovered a little on the voyage. When he arrived

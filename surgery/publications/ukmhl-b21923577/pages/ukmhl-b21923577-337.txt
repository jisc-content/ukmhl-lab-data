It may be the seat of chronic inflammation, with thickening and induration in the tubercular form, pro- ceeding to imperfect suppuration and ulceration.

Other internal organs are less frequently the seat of tubercular disease. 7. The bones and joints are frequently affected by scrofula, causing in the former inflammation, with caries and necrosis; in the latter, disease of the articular extremities, affecting the joints, and called in common language white swelling. The liability to scrofula does not extend equally throughout the whole of life; it is chiefly confined to the period of growth, at least from the end of suckling to puberty.

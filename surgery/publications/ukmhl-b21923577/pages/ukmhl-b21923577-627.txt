SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONEâ€”RECOVERY. 607 curred until several weeks after, when the cicatrix was found to have assumed the same livid hue as the original growth had exhibited; the suspicious spot was, therefore, a second time excised, and a portion of the alveolar border of the upper jaw was removed by cutting forceps, the potassa fusa being at the same time freely applied. Cicatriza- tion again took place, but more slowly. The part re- mained, however, without any appearance of reproduction until the expiration of nearly six months, when she was ad- mitted under the care of Mr. Stanley, by whom the livid cicatrix was once more removed, and the subjacent surface of bone carefully scraped. She remained several months in the hospital, during which the growth rapidly returned, involving now the right antrum, and also a portion of the left superior maxillary bone. Nearly all the teeth in the upper jaw became loose; a considerable projection occupied the right cheek, corresponding ala nasi, and the hard palate on both sides. The cavity of the right nostril, and the nasal duct, were completely obstructed, and the glands beneath the jaw were enlarged. The orbit was not involved. Consultations of the surgeons were frequently held on the question of operation, as the patient was very solicitous for its removal at any risk. The unanimous opinion was against the proceeding, partly because the disease had spread over the palate and formed a firm swelling on the left side of the - mouth, and partly in consequence of two small, moderately firm swellings, apparently connected with the bone, which had formed at the vertex of the skull. At length the poor girl left the hospital on February 3rd, 1851, and sought assistance at other institutions, the surgeons connected with which are not ordinarily remarkable for timidity in operative surgery j but no interference was deemed expedient. On February 13th, 1851, she was re-admitted into St. Bartholomew's

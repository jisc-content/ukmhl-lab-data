HECTIC FEVER. The constitutional disturbance which accompanies the copious suppuration of a chronic abscess, after the cyst has inflamed and the case is proceeding unfavorably, is called hectic fever. Hectic, a term of Greek origin, means habitual; and this fever is the continued constitutional disturbance seen in a system weakened by continued and serious local disease, more especially when such disease is attended with suppura-

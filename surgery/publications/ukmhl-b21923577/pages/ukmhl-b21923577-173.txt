SUPPURATION. 153 periosteum, particularly of the cranium, from syphilis. A girl of the town came into St. Bartholomew's with a sore on the labium as large as a sixpence, and a suppurated bubo. The skin over the latter was bright red and thin, the swelling was soft and seemed to contain at least an ounce of matter. I thought it fit for opening, but left it alone, prescribing blue pill night and morning, a black wash to the sore, and rest in bed, with poultice. On the next visit, the swelling was easier. Soon after, the size and redness of the part had obviously diminished, the skin became wrinkled, and in a short time all vestige of the mischief had disappeared.

There have been different modes of accomplishing the object; for instance by seton, a needle of suitable length, armed with a few threads of silk, being entered at one end, carried through the collection, and brought out at the other end, leaving the silk in the abscess as in an ordinary seton, in the expectation apparently that the matter would drain out at the openings. Such a proceeding could not fail to renew and aggravate the local excitement of a phlegmonous abscess, and thus add to the sufferings of the patient. I once saw a case in which this proceeding had been resorted to. It was a collection of matter in the neck of a young lady.

In the method by caustic, the thinned skin of the groin, which may have been extensively detached from the subjacent parts, may be rubbed with the potassa fusa so as to destroy its vitality. The matter will be dis- charged when the eschar separates; or the latter may be cut through, so as to evacuate the collection. Under such cir- cumstances there may be an advantage in getting rid of the

CHAPTER V. SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS, AND THE UNHEALTHY STATES OF CONSTITUTION TO WHICH THEY OWE THEIR ORIGIN. Having concluded the observations I had to offer to you respecting the treatment of those inflammations in which our attention and our curative efforts are principally directed to the suffering organ, with the view of speedily arresting disease, I must now revert to another and very large class of inflammatory affections, which I have already mentioned incidentally, viz., the spontaneous inflammations in which our views respecting the causes and mode of origin are different, and our treatment consequently exhibits corresponding modifications. Numerous inflammations, more particularly of the chronic kind, come on without any obvious exciting cause; in common language, they are said to come of themselves. To under- stand their origin we must look beyond the part, and careful research will enable us to explain the matter satisfactorily. We discover deviations from the healthy state of some im- portant 'functions, and as these disturbances are found in parts of general influence, the digestive organs, for example, we say, speaking perhaps rather loosely, that the constitu- tion is unhealthy. However, as these states of constitutional unhealthinesa give birth to a numerous and dissimilar progeny of local

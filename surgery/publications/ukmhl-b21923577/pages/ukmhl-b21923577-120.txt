100 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. Again, the same remedy is employed with advantage in inflammations of serous membranes, the pericardium, perito- neum, and pleura, in which abundant effusion of albumen and fibrine is the most striking feature. Are we not warranted in the general inference that mercury possesses the power of controlling that disturbed state of the capillaries on which the effusions above mentioned depend, and of thus preventing the changes of structure which they might produce. As fibrine disappears before our eyes in iritis under the influence of mercury, and as we cannot doubt that the albumino-fibrinous effusions of inflamed serous membranes are removed in the same way under the same treatment, the beneficial action of mercury has been said to be that of exciting absorption, to which its efficacy as an alterative in chronic enlargements had been formerly ascribed. We must, however, ascend a step higher in the analysis, m order to appreciate correctly the singular action of this remedy, and we shall be authorised, if I mistake not, to ascribe to it the power of arresting that disturbed condition of the capil- laries which is the essence of inflammation. The morbid products are removed, because the inflammation is at an end Thus, the swelling of an inflamed hand disappears when the inflammation has been arrested. The absorption of the effused fibrine would not be to much purpose if the inflam- mation causing its effusion still continued. If this be a just view of its powers, mercury is pre-eminently and above all others the antiphlogistic remedy. It is not however, safe to use it in the manner now described, until the violence of the attack has been checked by previous evacuations. _. , Digitalis lowers the pulse and acts on the kidneys It K an uncertain remedy, and in larger doses unsafe. Hence it is not generally used.

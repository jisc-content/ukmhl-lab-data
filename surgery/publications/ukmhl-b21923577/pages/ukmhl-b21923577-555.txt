OPERATION. 535 return to England, and I saw her when she arrived, in the beginning of February, 1850, when there was a firm and solid tumour in the bend of the right thigh, and a similar, but larger mass, within the abdomen in the immediate neigh- bourhood. Soon a second smaller tumour came in the right thigh, and another in the left inguinal region within the abdomen. She died early in May, the disease in the abdomen having attained an enormous size, but without any breach of surface. The two following cases exemplify favorable results in the prolongation of life, by operation, when the circumstances of the case at the time of its performance were altogether dis- couraging. A lady, between forty and forty-five, had an in- duration of the left breast, which had come on gradually, and was proceeding slowly when I saw her. The part was not enlarged, but the mammary gland was scirrhous and knotted, but movable on the chest. The nipple was retracted, and the integuments drawn in at several points near the circum- ference of the gland. The axillary glands were hardened. The circumstances were too unpromising for me to recom- mend the operation, which, however, the patient determined to undergo after receiving all the explanations she required. It was performed in April, 1829, the entire breast, with its integument, being freely removed, as well as the axillary glands. The wound, although large, healed quickly and favourably. She went to the seaside to recover strength, and subsequently experienced some undefined illness, which gra- dually passed off". In August, 1830,1 saw her in good health, and with a perfectly sound cicatrix. She continued well till June, 1842, when the abdomen had become enormously swelled with ascites, her health not having suffered more than it would have done from the incumbrance of the enlargement. The breast continued well, but there was a small hard knot

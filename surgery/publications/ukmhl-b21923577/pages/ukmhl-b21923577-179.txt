SUPPUEATION. should be as large as yon can make with safety, and, as the puncture or incision is carried through parts nearly healthy, "which would unite by adhesion if brought into con- tact, this must be prevented by interposing between them a slip of dressing. When the natural course of proceeding is thus anticipated by art, the inflammation does not subside, as it does after spontaneous bursting; sometimes it is rather increased. The means necessary to lessen inflammation must therefore be continued, and may require to be employed actively. The matter contained in an abscess, being completely shut out from external influences, undergoes no change so long as the collection is entire. It may remain weeks, months, or longer without exhibiting any of the spontaneous alterations, which exposure to the air would produce. When let out, the pus has merely a faint kind of odour. Sometimes, however, the matter is found to have undergone putrefactive decom- position ; it is dark-coloured, brownish or blackish, dis- coloured throughout, or streaked, and containing bubbles of air, being at the same time extremely fetid. Sometimes there is a mixture of blood with this offensive matter, dis- colouring it generally, or in streaks, or there may be coagula. Sometimes the pus is natural in colour and consistence, but stinks. These changes are seen more commonly in certain situ- ations and under particular circumstances. Thus putrid, dark- coloured matter, with mixture of air, is met with in suppura- tions near the anus, or the male urethra, in the perimeum or scrotum, in and more or less near the entrance of the female organs of generation. This peculiarity is not dependent on the existence of communication between these outlets and the abscesses; for it is observed where there is no such com- munication, nor is it a constant occurrence in the abscesses of such situations.

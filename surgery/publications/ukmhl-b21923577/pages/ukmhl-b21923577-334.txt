314. SCROFULA. There is an insensible transition from common to scro- fulous disease; hence the diagnosis is often somewhat uncertain. The word scrofula, indeed, denotes a difference in the character and progress, not in the essential nature of disease. For scrofula consists of inflammation and its various effects, namely, interstitial deposition, enlargement, induration, suppuration, ulceration; with the restorative processes of granulation and cicatrization. The description of scrofula, therefore, embraces the modifications which these processes undergo in a particular class of subjects, and its treatment consists in various de- viations from the ordinary mode of proceeding required by those modifications, and by the constitutional peculiarities on which they are founded. In comparison with common inflammation, scrofulous is less active and rapid; the inflammatory characters are not so strongly marked. It has not the firm swelling, the bright- red colour, and the acute pain of common inflammation, nor does it, in general, exert so powerful a sympathetic influence on the constitution. Yet we occasionally see, in the scrofulous affections, which, in respect of redness, swelling, heat, and pain, are closely allied to common inflammation, so that the distinction of acute or chronic is applicable to both cases. Scrofulous suppuration is slow in its progress, increase, and advance to the surface. The skin is extensively detached and thinned before it ulcerates. Scrofulous abscesses are, therefore, generally chronic. The contained fluid is mucous or serous rather than purulent, or it is a very thin pus, with a mixture of flakes and curdy matter. Scrofulous inflammation seldom terminates in mortification. When it does occur it is not as a consequence of violent inflammation. Without much local disturbance, part of a glandular swelling may be deprived of vitality and converted

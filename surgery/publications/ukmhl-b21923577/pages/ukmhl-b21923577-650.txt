630 OSTEOID CANCER. OSTEOID CANCER. Osteoid Cancer.â€”Although the external and obvious cha- racters of structure in the hones appear, on first view, not only different from, hut directly opposite to, those of the softer parts, the pathology is essentially the same in the two cases. This is seen in the repair of injuries, in the causes, progress, and nature of morbid affections, and par- ticularly in the liability of the bones to cancer and fungus ha3matodes, both primary and secondary, as well as to mela- nosis in the latter form. This pathological correspondence is carried still further by the circumstance that the bones give rise occasionally to diseased formations, in which bony struc- tures and cancerous elements are intermingled in various proportions, fibrous or fibro-cartilaginous materials also being sometimes present at the same time. Such growths spring from the surface of the hone, the femur most fre- quently, and surround it, the medullary cavity participating in the disease sooner or later. They are distinguished from exostoses and fibro-cartilaginous tumours, which they re- semble in position and firmness, by growing rapidly and with pain, which is often so considerable as to affect the health. The disease involves all the lymphatic glands in the course of absorption, which are enlarged and converted into hard masses of the osteoid disease, and ultimately disease is developed in the internal organs, more particularly in the chest. In some instances the disease has advanced slowly and without pain for several years, and has then assumed a more active form. The result of amputation, which had been performed in many instances, has been invariably fatal. Osteoid cancer is an appropriate denomination for this disease, of which cases are related by Mr. Stanley, under the name of malignant osseous tumour j while the subject is con-

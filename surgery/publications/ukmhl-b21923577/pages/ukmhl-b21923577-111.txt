TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 91 YV lien an active inflammation exists, the constitution bears the depletion; but injurious effects will surely ensue if loss of blood be resorted to where there is no inflammation, and especially if the symptoms thus produced should be mistaken, as they may be, for those of continued inflammation, so as to lead to a repetition of the depletion. You will hence see the necessity of abstaining from this measure unless a clear indication for it is presented by active inflammation of some â€¢organ or by general plethora, increased fulness and action of the vascular system generally. The morbid effects are either immediate or remote. The immediate are syncope, in its various degrees, from slight faintness to fatal cessation of vascular action, convulsions, delirium, coma. Syncope occurs most easily in the erect pos- ture ; some faint so easily from loss of blood, that it is neces- sary to bleed them in the recumbent or horizontal position. Syncope being the natural remedy for loss of blood and the natural mode of arresting it, gives no alarm to medical persons, though it frightens bystanders out of their wits. When the arm is bound up and the patient left quiet, he soon recovers. If remedies are required, they are the hori- zontal position (laying the patient at full length on the floor), smelling-salts and stimuli, such as wine, sal volatile, or brandy and water. I never saw the least ground for alarm from syncope in venesection, nor heard of a fatal termination. But such an event is, no doubt, possible. Care is required under particular circumstances, as in elderly persons, where much blood has been lost already, and in those labouring under disease of the heart or large vessels. It is not likely that venesection would be resorted to under such circum- stances. If the case should present any uncertainty, and even independently of that, it would be well to observe care- fully the effect of the depletion on the pulse.

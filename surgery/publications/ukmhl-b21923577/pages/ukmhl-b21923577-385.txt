USE OF MERCURY. 365 attention was paid by the Portuguese and Spaniards to the earlier stages of syphilis, and he was surprised not only at seeing primary sores cured without mercury, but also on finding that no subsequent ill consequences ensued. He saw some similar instances among the British soldiers, and was puzzled by the contrast which the continued good health of those persons presented with Mr. Hunter's alarming account of the terrible effects which must have ensued when the means of cure were not understood, and the description of the ravages said to have been caused by syphilis at the period of its imaginary origin. There can be little doubt that the two latter were, to say the least, greatly exaggerated. In the same way an apparently circumstantial account was given of great destruction caused by the introduction of the disease into Otaheite, which was discovered by subsequent observations to have been entirely unfounded. Although the researches of Mr. Rose, supported as they have been by other concurrent evidence, entirely overthrew the long-established doctrine that the cure of syphibs without the use of mercury is impossible, and thus proved that repeated and injurious courses of the remedy are quite un- necessary, they do not and were not intended by that gen- tleman to show that the remedy ought to be altogether dis- carded, that it has no special power over the disease, or that it ought not to be still retained, under proper management, as the principal means of treating a large portion of venereal affections. I must, therefore, express my entire dissent from the opinions of a distinguished teacher, the late Dr. John Thompson, Professor of Pathology in the University of Edin- burgh, who entirely abandoned the use of mercury both in primary and secondary syphilis, considering not only that patients recover much better without it, but that many of the affections regarded as the secondary symptoms of syphilis,

The progress of the inflammation brings on increase of swelling with redness, heat, pain, and constitutional disturbance. Suppu- ration frequently ensues, the matter being usually formed in the cellular texture round the gland, not in the substance of the latter.

When the case is proceeding favorably, they soon granulate like the rest of tbe surface.

Some- times they do not arise till days or weeks have elapsed, the sore being nearly, or even completely healed.

An eminent surgeon in the neighbourhood was consulted, and recommended an immediate operation, and apiece as large as a walnut was accordingly removed, in 1836. The wound got well quickly and remained well, except occasional slight abrasions of the surface. These had returned more frequently in the last three years, terminating in little fissures. About a month before she came to London the tongue itself had considerably enlarged, and she was only capable of taking liquid food. The sublingual glands were much enlarged, but those of the neck were not affected. She did not suffer acute pain, the third of a grain of morphia at night being sufficient to procure comfortable sleep. As she was reduced in flesh, although the liquid food she took was of the most nutritive kind, she could not have lived long after returning to the country. In operating on the tongue, there are two modes of pro- ceeding, simple excision, and strangulation of the diseased part by ligature. It is necessary in both that the organ should be protruded to its full extent, and firmly held in that position towards the side of the mouth opposite to that of the disease, in order to enable the operator to carry his incision, or the application of the ligature beyond the pos- terior extent of the disease. This essential part of the pro- ceeding must be effectually performed by an assistant seizing the front of the tongue between his finger and thumb, with the intervention of a cloth sufficiently rough to give a firm hold. A French instrument for holding and drawing out the tongue, without bruising it or giving pain, although ingenious, and sufficient for its object under other circumstances, cannot be trusted on these occasions. The closure of the mouth during the time occupied by the operation, which is short, is effectively prevented by an instrument devised by Mr.

The three upper dorsal vertebra were diseased, and a considerable angle resulted, without any pressure on the cord Tbe bodies of the vertebra were compressed, and much of the bony structure was replaced by an elastic, semi-trans- parent, new substance, so that they could be readily cut with a knife. The plates of these vertebra were much softened, and yielded readily to the chisel. The medulla of the cord was softened for two inches, but not disor- ganized. The sternum could be cut into, indicating plainly that a similar change had been going on here also, where, indeed, pain had been experienced occasionally.

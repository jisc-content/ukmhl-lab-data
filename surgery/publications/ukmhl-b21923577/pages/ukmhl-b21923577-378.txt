An apparatus is employed for the purpose, consisting of a small grate, a thick piece of iron and a funnel: the iron, heated red hot, is placed on the grate, and half a dram or a dram of cinnabar is thrown on the iron, over which the funnel, which has a straight or curved tube, is then placed. The cinnabar is volatilized by the heat, and rises in .the form of white fumes, which are directed against an ulcerated surface by the tube of the funnel, and form on it a whitish pellicle. The peculiar effect of mercury upon the constitution can be produced either by applying certain preparations to the surface of the body, or by administering others internally. The most common mode of external use is by friction, that is, rubbing on the inside of the thighs, before the fire, for the space of twenty or thirty minutes every night, a dram of the strong mercurial ointment,- sometimes half a dram only is employed. It may be necessary to rub twice a day. When the rubbing is ended, most of the ointment will be found to have disappeared; it may be said to have been rubbed in. The patient should not wipe off what remains, but put on a pair of flannel drawers, and wear them during the process. If pimples should break out by rubbing the ointment on the inside of the thighs, the patient must vary the part on which he rubs. And inasmuch as some of the ointment sticks on the skin, it is necessary to wash the surface clean every third night, before beginning to rub in. When mercurial ointment is employed in this way, it is capable of producing the same general effect on the system as when other forms are taken internally. It should seem that the ointment is forced through the cuticle by the rubbing, so that it may be taken up and pass into the system. Simple external application is not sufficient for the purpose. It must, however, be observed, that if the ointment be spread rather thickly on flannel, ap- plied on a part, the testicle, for example, every night, and

VENEREAL VIIIUS. 349 very unpleasant, indeed a painful occurrence. It is difficult to get clear evidence on tlie point, the motives for misrepresenta- tion and concealment being strong. I have seen cases, in which I believed that syphilitic disease occurred in married women from cohabitation with husbands labouring under secondary symptoms; and I see no reason why the infection may not be conveyed through the seminal secretion of a diseased male as well as through the blood of a diseased pregnant woman. We speak and write familiarly about the venereal virus or poison as if it were something well known to us, but we are not acquainted with its real nature, knowing it only by its effects. Thus I could only describe it as that state of se- cretion from a sore which is capable of producing a sore in another person; that it is the state of the mother's blood which renders it capable of infecting the offspring; but what these particular states are, we are unable to determine, that is, we have no sensible or chemical signs by which the matter of a sore, or the blood of a pregnant woman under such circum- stances, differs from ordinary matter or from ordinary blood. When, therefore, we read of the venereal virus " entering" or being " expelled" from the constitution, or of the constitution being "impregnated" with it, or of its "lurking" in the system, these are vague expressions, which have no precise meaning. The next point of inquiry is, whether there be one kind of poison only, or more than one ? Inasmuch as the real nature of the poison, that is, the real source of the symptoms, is unknown, this question resolves itself into another: whether the various symptoms that we recognise as syphilitic are so different from each other, and so regular in those differences as to induce us to refer them to different sources ? We must acknowledge, on a superficial view, that there is considerable variety in those symptoms, to which we give collectively the name of syphilis, or venereal disease, that there is such

DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSIC AND SURGERY. 9 from smallpox, measles, scarlatina, and chronic cutaneous eruptions; from scrofula and syphilis, cancer, fungus hsema- todes, and melanosis. If, therefore, an organ so complex in its structure, and liable to such a number and variety of diseases, can be safely intrusted to the care of the surgeon, I am at a loss to know why there should be any distinction, grounded on the nature of the affections, between the surgeon and physician. It is in vain, then, to establish separate professorships of external and internal, pathology; to institute distinct colleges of physic and surgery; to teach them as separate sciences, and to expect tbat they shall be practised separately. Lec- turers and writers cannot make the distinction; and thus we find the same diseases, in many instances, considered by the teachers of physic and surgery, comprehended in the writings of both; illustrated by both on the same principles, and treated by the same means. Some have proposed to assign local diseases to the surgeon, general to the physician. It may be questioned whether there are any local or general diseases in the strict sense of the terms; at all events there are few in which the cause has been applied to the part itself, and in which the in- fluence of the disease, as well as of the treatment, is con- fined to the part; whde, on the other hand, there are hardly any in which all parts of the frame are affected. When a part of little consequence in the animal economy is slightly diseased, no sensible effect may be produced beyond the part itself; if, on the contrary, an important organ is actively dis- ordered, many other parts feel the influence; and hence arise what are called general affections. Even in fever we can clearly trace the general disturbance to a local origin in so many cases that the very existence of fever, as a general affection, has been questioned. The difference, therefore,

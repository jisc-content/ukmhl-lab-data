90 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. taken up and repeated more as a matter of fashion and obedience to supposed authority than from the result of expe- rience and observation. The plan once generally prevalent in country districts, of healthy persons being bled twice a year, in spring and fall, as a precautionary measure, would alone be a sufficient proof that blood has often been taken away incau- tiously and needlessly, while it may justify the belief that the practice has been less injurious than might have been expected. That the practice of taking away blood occasionally to a greater or less extent in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, which has prevailed universally wherever the science and art of medicine have been most successfully cultivated, may have been altogether a mistake, is possible. Stronger evidence and arguments than have yet been produced will be necessary to prove the point, and still more powerful proofs will be required to satisfy us that the opposite mode of combating such affections, by means of stimulants, including the free use of brandy, is either advantageous or safe. It would be a public misfortune if the sanction of professional authority should be given to a treatment calculated to encourage the pernicious habit of spirit-drinking. Morbid effects of the loss of blood.â€”The loss of blood exerts a powerful influence over the animal economy, and hence its beneficial operation in the treatment of inflammations. Hence, too, serious dangers may result from its injudicious employment; from using it in cases where it is not required ; from carrying it to too great extent, and most particularly from the frequent repetition of it to a large amount, espe- cially under an erroneous estimate of the ca;=e and a mis- apprehension of the indications which it presents. Hence, in doubtful cases, great caution is required in determining on the measure originally, in fixing the quantity, and in resort- ing to its repetition.

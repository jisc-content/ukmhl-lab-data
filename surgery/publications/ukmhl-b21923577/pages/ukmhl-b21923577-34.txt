In most cases, too, unless the knife be guided by minute anatomical knowledge, operations are attended, not only with unnecessary suffering aud risk to the patient, but also with the greatest danger to the reputation of the operator. I trust, gentlemen, that you will not be anxious to dis- cover how small a stock of scientific knowledge will enable you to carry on the trade of surgery. Your more honorable course will be to render yourselves accurate anatomists, as the most essential step towards becoming good surgeons. The health, the limbs, the lives of our fellow-creatures are in- trusted to our care, with a confidence in our knowledge, skill and humanity; our utmost exertions in the acquisition of knowledge will not do more than enable us to under- take this serious responsibility.

How could he bear his own reflections, if serious and perma- nent injury or loss of life, should ensue, as the consequence of his ignorance and rashness ? But the study of anatomy and physiology does not make us acquainted with disease : you may know the structure and functions of an organ perfectly, and yet be ignorant of its diseases How then are these to be learned? Not from lectures, nor from writings, but by studying the great book of nature. You must frequent the hospital and the sick chamber, and observe diseases for yourselves. Lectures and books are auxiliaries, and, under certain circumstances, usetul ones 5 but they are of secondary importance, compared to the actual observation of disease. To know disease, then, you must see, examine, and closely

284 SCALDS AND BURNS. may take place. The danger of this state is greatest in the first three or four days j at the end of that time reaction will probably have become established. When scalds and burns of considerable extent are not attended with these dangerous symptoms, they cause severe pain, and much febrile disorder. Remember the local suf- fering and general disquiet caused even by a boil, that is, by inflammation in a spot of the skin and subjacent tissue. What must you expect when a considerable portion of the surface is highly inflamed ? Injuries of the trunk are more dangerous than those of the extremities. Although life should not be endangered, the local mischief and its repair may involve subsequent deformity or impaired function. Treatment.â€”Two methods of treatment, apparently oppo- site, have been employed in different cases, namely, warm and cold applications. In slight cases of scalds, more particularly, we may adopt the usual course of preventing or lessening local inflammation by means of cold, using cold spring water, vinegar and water, saturnine lotion. Greater cold may be produced by applying ice, or by the evaporation of alcohol or ether. The im- mediate immersion of a scalded part in cold water may so check inflammation as to prevent vesication. If the part or the patient should become chill, the cold should be discontinued. Vesicated or denuded parts may be covered by light and soft dressing. The linimentum calcis, made of linseed oil and lime water in equal parts answers the purpose perfectly well. This mild and soft liniment, spread thickly on lint, gives efficient protection to the injured surfaces in the great majority of bums and scalds, and should not be changed as long as the parts are easy. It is familiarly known as the Carron oil, being the

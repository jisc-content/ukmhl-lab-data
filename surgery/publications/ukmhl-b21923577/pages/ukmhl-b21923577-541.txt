CAUSES. 521 Causes.â€”The disease is sometimes ascribed to external injury, such as a blow, and in occasional instances we see the point clearly established, as in the following case. A robust and healthy married woman, about forty, still menstruating, and accustomed to eat and drink freely, received in July, 1828, an accidental severe blow on the left breast, from which she experienced considerable pain. Her medical attendant thought it necessary to bleed, leech, and use other active means, although there was no swelling at the time. A con- siderable and hard swelling soon formed, for which I saw her in October. Free and repeated leeching, with regulated diet, improved health, but had no effect on the part. Soon after, a small gland was found to be swelled in the axilla. I removed the entire mammary gland in December; it was scirrhous, with a large, irregular cavity in the centre, con- taining fluid. It was necessary to cut out the whole chain of absorbent glands, although their morbid change could not have been discovered before the operation; they were enlarged, hardened, and contained interstitial deposition. The wound united by adhesion. I saw this patient in 1832, perfectly well. In the great majority of cases there is no assignable cause. The complaint must be referred to the spontaneous class, as its origin is not noticed by the patient, and its existence is only discovered accidentally. It may occur in two or more individuals of the same family, and then it will generally be found to have existed in persons of the preceding generation, so that we cannot help believing in the transmission of an hereditary predisposition, though we cannot even conjecture in what that consists. It may occur in those of excellent constitution and sound health, in whom hereditary predispo- sition cannot be traced. Although cancer may originate and attain some magnitude

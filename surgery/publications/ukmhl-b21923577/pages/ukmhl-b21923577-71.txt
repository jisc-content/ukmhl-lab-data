ITS NATUKE AND SYMPTOMS. 51 between which the contrast in the number and size of the vessels is most striking:. Though these circumstances prove that an increased quantity of blood is sent to the inflamed part, it does not follow that a greater quantity is circulating through it. That a greater quantity enters is beyond doubt, and it has been supposed that the additional supply is stagnant, or confined, m the part. But other circumstances prove distinctly that a greater quantity actually circulates through it. If you cut into an inflamed part, blood flows much more abundantly than it would from a similar incision in a sound part. Take the case of phlegmonous erysipelas, which occupies the skin and cellular membrane. If you make an incision, not going deeper than the fascia, a great number of vessels bleed most freely, so that twenty or thirty ounces of blood may escape very rapidly. If you perform an operation on an inflamed part, or in its immediate neighbourhood, which you should avoid if possible, the vessels, both arterial and venous, bleed most profusely. The distended state of the veins sufficiently proves that there is more rapid circulation. The comparative state of the circulation in an inflamed and uninflamed part is shown in the case of a young man admitted into the hospital with violent inflammation of the hand, already ex- tending to the forearm at the end of a week, from an accident to the little finger. The radial pulse of the inflamed limb was full, strong, and frequent. I ordered that a vein should be opened in each arm at the same time. About fifteen ounces of blood flowed from the inflamed limb, while three ounces were escaping from the opposite side. The latter had a thin, buffy covering, while the former presented a thick layer of the toughest fibrinc, and was cupped to the utmost extent. This general view, then, leads us to see that the phenomena

233 UNION BY ADHESION. The union is not effected by blood, Mr. Hunter's notion on this subject being now considered erroneous. The presence of coagula, although it may stick the sides together for a time, prevents adhesion. In reference to this object, blood is a foreign body, and ought to be carefully removed before the sides of a wound are approximated. This effusion of fibrine is seen under the five following circumstances, and, so far as the nature of the substance is concerned, the process is essentially similar in all. 1. Union by adhesion, or the first intention. 2. As the commencement of healing by the second intention, or granulation. 3. In inflammatory swell- ing of a part. 4. In the walls of an abscess. 5. In inflam- mation of serous membranes. That state of a part in which fibrine is thus effused was called, by Mr. Hunter,adhesive inflammation. Objections, not altogether unfounded, have been made to this generalization, which, although in itself interesting, unites the healthy pro- cess of adhesion, by means of a common name, with the morbid state of inflammation. Under favorable circum- stances, the sides of a wound are agglutinated without any observable vascular disturbance; without swelling, redness, heat or pain, that is, without any of the usual characteristics of inflammation. The supervention of inflammation prevents adhesion. Effusion of fibrine is not the result of any peculiar kind, but rather of a certain degree of inflammation. Dif- ferences of texture, however, produce difference in this respect â€¢ thus, effusion of fibrine, which occurs most easily in serous, is difficultly excited in mucous membranes. All the softer textures of the body are susceptible of union by the effusion of fibrine, as we see constantly in skin, cellular membrane, muscle, tendon, nerves, coats of intestine. Broken bones grow together more slowly on account of their hardness, but the process is not essentially different.

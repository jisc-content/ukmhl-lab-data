116 SPONTANEOUS INFLAMMATIONS. overfilled. I do not use the term to point out loss of blood ; moderate living and strong exercise would be advisable. If the errors in diet, which originally caused the state of plethora are continued j if excessive supplies are still poured in, so as to increase the load which already oppresses the system, the organs cannot dispose of them; their functions become disordered, and a state of system ensues very different from that just described. The stomach, as might be expected, suffers first: when digestion, the first and most important step in assimilation, is performed imperfectly, the associated and subsequent pro- cesses of biliary and pancreatic secretion, chylification, lacteal absorption, urinary, fsecal and cutaneous excretion are ne- cessarily interrupted or impaired. The effects of disorder in these central and important functions must be felt in all parts. The alimentary canal and the organs connected with it supply the new materials for the repair and growth of the body, and for its various internal movements; and it disposes of the alimentary residue after the nutriment has been extracted from it. When healthy supplies are produced, all the animal actions, bodily and mental, are carried on pro- perly ; the body is active, the mind is alert, and a general feeling of health and vigour pervades the frame. On the contrary, when the alimentary canal is filled with undigested matters and unhealthy secretions, the composition of the blood must become vitiated, and the materials of disease, rather than of health, are distributed over the frame. Hence the nutrition of the body suffers: we cannot be surprised that any part should become diseased j that any corporeal or mental function should become disturbed. The symptoms which characterise the state of an individual thus circumstanced, are referable to three points. 1. Dis-

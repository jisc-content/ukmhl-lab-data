FACE. 549 frequently witnessed in the analogous affection of the lip. Destructive ulcers of the face, which from their intractahle nature, indefinite hut very slow extension, and unfavorable termination, have usually heen called cancers, and are now denominated rodent ulcers, present in some cases points of resemblance in their characters and in the extension of mis- chief to the absorbent glands to the epithelial cases, but differ from them in the possibility of receiving at least temporary alleviation, if not cure, by local means, when they may have become far too extensive to admit of excision. A man, about sixty, was an out-patient at St. Bartholomew's in 1831, with a large ulcer on the side of the face, of uneven surface, with knotted and irregular margin, which had existed twenty- four years. Its boundaries were the bridge and left ala of the nose, the left lower eyelid, which has been nearly destroyed, the temple, and the left angle of the mouth. A dressing of the liquor opii sedativus diluted had been used, with the effect of relieving pain. It was observed that the sore bled copiously on removing the dressing; on this hint leeches were applied to the surface repeatedly, and complete cicatrization slowly took place, except at the external angle of the eye, where a portion of skin was raised and tuberculated with small super- ficial ulcerations. The surface of the cicatrix still remained uneven, and the edge knotted and irregular. An old man was admitted into the hospital in the summer of 1831, with an ulcer at the angle of the mouth of many years' duration, so large that excision would hardly have been practicable, even if there had not existed a considerable indu- rated enlargement of the submaxillary absorbent glands. He had erysipelas of the face, and as he was getting better the sore lessened, and its raised edge sank considerably. It was cicatrizing and in a fair progress to healing, when he left the hospital.

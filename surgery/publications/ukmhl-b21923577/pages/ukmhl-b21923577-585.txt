In men the disease may begin on the glans or lining of the prepuce, it involves both as it proceeds, converting the end of the organ into a large and firm mass of irregular warty surface. It does not extend rapidly on the external integument, nor on the body of the penis, the anterior ends of the corpora cavernosa being found quite healthy, although completely inclosed in the diseased mass. The corpus spongiosum of the urethra is also found unaffected. Some- times the disease begins with induration of the glans, pro- ceeding to ulceration, with hardened base and edge, the pro- gress being slow, so that the disease may be seen fully esta- blished, with the prepuce still sound. Occasionally there is an adventitious deposit of firm but not scirrhous structure in the prepuce, with gradual extension of mischief to the glans, and considerable enlargement of the affected parts; the corpora cavernosa may here become involved. As soon as the character of the affection is clearly established, the operation should be performed beyond the seat of the morbid change, and with more favorable chances than in most other cancers, as the absorbent glands are not affected at an early period of the complaint. As this operation is fre- quently performed in an hospital on patients from the country, who return home when the wound is healed, we have no clear evidence on the question of permanent cure. In the case of a gentleman, on whom I had operated early, I heard incidentally, some years afterwards, that he con- tinued quite well. Should excision be performed when the glands are diseased, not merely enlarged but hardened, disease will go on in them to destruction of the patient, although the scat of the operation remains sound.

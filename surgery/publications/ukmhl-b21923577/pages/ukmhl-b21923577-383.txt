3G3 USE OF MERCURY. various other articles have been pi*oposed as remedies for the venereal disease; and cases have been published in which these, various as they are in their nature, are said to have produced the desired effect of curing the complaint. According to the prevalent notion of mercury being the only remedy for the venereal disease, when a cure was stated to have been effected by otber means, such as sarsaparilla, guaiacum, mezereon, nitric acid, or various other things, it was said the patients got well, because they had not the true venereal disease. We can have no doubt in admitting that the cases which were supposed to be incorrectly reported, or not to have been truly venereal, were really syphilitic. The clearest evidence however, respecting this point, that mercury is not necessary to the cure of syphilis, has been afforded by the investigations of the late Mr. Rose, surgeon of St. George's Hospital.

He determined to treat all the primary symptoms that might occur in the battalion simply by common antiphlogistic means, whether they had the characters supposed to be those of true syphilis or any other. He resolved, in short, that all should be treated without mercury. The result of his expe- rience is contained in a paper published in the eighth volume of the ' Medico-Chirurgical Transactions/ entitled < Ob- servations on the Treatment of Syphilis, with an Account of several Cases of that Disease, in which a Cure was effected without the use of Mercury.' After following this plan for two years, he found that all primary syphilitic symptoms could be cured without the employment of mercury; whether they were indurated chancres, superficial sores, or whatever

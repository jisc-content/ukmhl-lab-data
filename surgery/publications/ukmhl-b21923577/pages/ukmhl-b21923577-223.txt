MORTIFICATION. 203 the situation of the wound in the groin, the femoral artery was found obliterated. " I have seen two instances in which the limb mortified after the ligature of the principal artery. The part at which the living was connected with the dead flesh exhibited the usual appearances of gangrene. The remainder of the dead parts had not undergone those peculiar changes which take place when gangrene is the consequence of inflammation. They had the appearance of parts which have remained a long time in a dissecting-room. They were of a pale colour, and soon became putrid. The cuticle peeled off, and was followed by an oozing of filthy sanies. I have, however, heard of instances in which the whole limb became black, and presented the appearances which are peculiar to gangrene."* In a case under my care in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where the popliteal artery and vein were torn across by a violent injury, the foot and leg became cold, and presented the appearances of a dead limb. Is the previous local disturbance a certain degree, or a peculiar kind of inflammation ? Mortification may occur at all ages, in all kinds of con- stitution, and in every state of health. It may take place in all organs, and affect them under every variety of extent. Hence the mode of attack, the state of the affected parts, the kind and degree of constitutional disturbance, and the whole progress of the affection; the prognosis and the treatment must differ most widely in different cases. Considered generally, this affection is a cessation of vital movement, or, more particularly, of the circulation of a part. The blood ceases to flow; hence loss of natural colour, and temperature, of sensibility, and the power of motion. The part becomes cold and turns of a dirty grayish, yellowish, * Hodgson, 'Treatise on the Diseases of Arteries and Veins,' p. 265.

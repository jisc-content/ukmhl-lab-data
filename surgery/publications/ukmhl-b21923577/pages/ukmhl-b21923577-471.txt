SYPHILIS IN INFANTS. 451 Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson has pointed out and figured mal- formations of the incisor teeth, which he regards as clear indications of syphilitic infection. 1 have seen a girl about eight or ten years old, in whom the four adult incisors, very well-formed teeth, had become so loose that they were ready to drop out. They came away almost without force, the corresponding alveolar portion of the superior maxillary bones being necrosed. Although the mother who brought this patient to the hospital said there was nothing else amiss in the mouth, I looked into the throat, where I found that the uvula had disappeared, and the velum had undergone ulce- ration, which had not completely cicatrized. According to the account of mother and daughter, who were decent and respectable persons, this disease had not been noticed. There was also a large node of the tibia, which became very painful, and proved extremely obstinate. The dead portion of bone came away in time, leaving a round opening of communication with the nose, which in a few weeks was in a state to admit of closure by a plate of vulcanite bearing the teeth, and adapted to the palate by Mr. Alfred Coleman so skilfully that all the functions of the part are performed perfectly The mother had been affected with syphilis, including nodes or the cranium.

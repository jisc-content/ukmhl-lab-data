SUPPURATION. Symptoms.â€”A violent inflammation, proceeding rapidly, accompanied by throbbing pain, especially if left to itself, is likely to cause suppuration. The actual formation of matter is accompanied by diminution or complete remission of pain, except where inflammatory tension is maintained by the un- yielding nature of the parts affected or of those containing and surrounding it; also by diminution or cessation of the febrile disturbance. Both the local and general symptoms may, however, be aggravated when suppuration occurs in parts of dense and resisting organization, especially when they are covered and connected with highly organised and sensitive structures as under periosteum, in the digital thecse, in the palm, or sole. There is often a sense of weight and tension, with pulsation synchronous with the heart's action. Frequently suppuration is preceded and accompanied by shiverings or rigors; these do not constantly attend. Matter mav form without rigora and the latter frequently occur without suppuration: they commonly attend the outbreak of serious spontaneous disease. The most unequivocal evidence that matter has formed is the sensation of softness which its presence occasions. On feeling the part, you are sensible that a fluid is there. If you place the fingers of the two hand's on the part, at a distance from each other, and press alternately, the fluid is forced from one side to the other, the sensation thus received being called fluctuation. Careful examination is necessary, in order to determine whether matter has formed or not, especially when the in- flammation has been deep-seated. Instead of keeping up an alternate pressure with the two hands, by which an im- pulse is sometimes produced where matter has not formed, let one hand rest on the part, then press firmly and quickly

ITS NATUKE AND SYMPTOMS. 49 tion and swelling in the surrounding parts, or these changes caused by interstitial deposition may occur alone, without the more serious alterations, not only augmenting bulk but con- siderably impairing motion. Inflammation is said to terminate in mortification, suppu- ration, interstitial deposition, or resolution. The latter is a real termination j the normal state of structure and function is restored. The inflammation may go on unabated after the other changes. Such, then, are the effects which inflammation produces in the part which is its immediate seat, and these are the primary or local symptoms of the disturbance. At the same time, in a violent inflammation, important on account of the organ affected, or from its extent, other effects are produced, called secondary, sympathetic, or constitutional. They exemplify the intimate connexion which binds together the various organs, and involve so many parts that, speaking loosely, the constitution may be said to suffer generaUy. The vascular system is disturbed, the action of the heart being affected, the pulse full, strong, and hard.

The secretions are suspended, or, at least, diminished in quan- tity. The skm is hot and dry, the mouth is dry, the urine scanty. These constitutional or sympathetic disturbances havino- been produced by the local affection, gradually g0 off in pro" portion as the original disorder abates. They are relieved more particularly when suppuration occurs, for then the secretions are restored. The circulation, relieved by this 4

UNION BY ADHESION. 237 linen rag twice folded, dipped in water, and squeezed, may be applied if the coolness is agreeable. If no inflam- mation occurs, the plasters may be left for three, four, or more days, and then renewed, if it should seem advisable; generally a simple damp cloth is sufficient. If the plasters are rendered stiff and uneasy by blood which has become dried, they should be removed earlier : this may be done at the end of twenty hours if necessary. If the edges are red and painful, and union has been only partial, that is, if inflammation has occurred, damp cloths, or a thin and soft bread poultice will be preferable. Sutures are employed either alone, or in conjunction with adhesive plasters in the form called interrupted, which consists of separate stitches. They are necessary where the integuments "are loose and folded, as in the scrotum or neck, or where moisture might detach plasters, as about the mouth. The sutures should be made with sharp needles and small ligatures; for instance, a single stout silk thread, such as would be used in tying arteries. The number of stitches should be such as wiU bring the edges of the wound together, and maintain them in apposition. The two methods may be used in different parts of the same wound. The sutures may be cut out, if there is no reason for retaining them, in twelve, twenty-four, or more hours; that is, when they have kept the parts together sufficiently long for the purpose of union, and before their presence can have excited inflammation. If the sutures should be put on the stretch by inflammatory sweUing of the parts, they should be removed at once. Recently slender metallic wires, of silver or iron, have been employed for surgical suture's in pre ference to threads of silk or other material. They answer the purpose perfectly well, and do not cause the slightest irntation m the textures through which they pass â€¢ in this

HYDROPHOBIA. 261 not produce hydrophobia in cows and sheep by wounding them and applying to the part sponge moistened with the saliva of rabid animals of the same class; but the disease was excited when the sponge was moistened with the saliva of a mad dog. According to Dupuy,. no communication of rabies takes place in flocks of sheep by the presence of those affected with the complaint. Can hydrophobia be communicated from one human being to another; or to other animals? No instance of the former is known. Many attempts have been made to convey it by inoculation to other animals. These have failed, except in one or two instances. Magendie and Breschet in- oculated two dogs on June 19th, 1813, from a patient in the Hotel Dieu; one became rabid on the 27th July, and bit two other dogs, one of which was affected with hydrophobia on the 26th of August. Mode of production.â€”The poisonous saliva by which the disease is produced, must be applied, either to a recent wound or to a raw surface of the skin. It has no injurious effect either on entire skin or on entire mucous membrane, so that it might be swallowed with impunity. The infection, received in the great majority of instances from the dog or the wolf, is generally, but not necessarily, conveyed by a bite. Some years ago, a lady of rank and fashion had a pimple on her face, of which she had scratched off the head; she had a lapdog, which she allowed to lick her face. Hydrophobia was thus contracted, and she perished by this terrible disease. The disease is communicated most certainly by the bite. Mr. Cline and Sir A. Cooper both failed in attempts to intro- duce it in the dog by inoculation, the former from the human subject, the latter from the dog. (Travers, f On Constitu-

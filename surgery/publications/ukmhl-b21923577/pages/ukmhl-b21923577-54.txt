34 THE NATURE AND basis of the several organs is the same throughout, the morbid affections must be essentially similar. That part of the science of medicine which considers names and the distribution of diseases into classes is technically called Nosology. Diseases have sometimes been considered topographically, that is, according to their situation m the body â–  and old writers have generally treated them m this way, beginning with diseases of the head, and descending to the other parts of the body. This, at all events, does not involve any theoretic ground of confusion, but it leads to tedious repetitions. Medical nosologists have generally founded their arrange- ments on the nature of diseases; and their efforts have, in general, been unsuccessful, because this part of the subject is imperfectly known. Most of these nosologists have been but Httle acquainted with anatomy and physiology and therefore their distinctions have in most instances been fanciful, and have been founded on particular doctrines and systems which will not bear examination. The greatest advantage has been derived in the study of natural history from scientific nomenclature and classification, for which we are chiefly indebted to Linmeus, a man of extra- ordinary talent, industry, and restless ardour in the pursuit of knowledge, to which he devoted the first three quarters of the last century. He undertook the immense task of naming and arranging all organized beings, and executed it so successfuBy that his system soon obtained universal currency, and stiU maintains its ground to a considerable extent. He studied species, and gave them rational names, and then grouped them according to their natural affinities, distinguishing them by their natural differences. The success which attended his efforts in natural history led to attempts of a similar kind in the arrangement of diseases. A nosology was published

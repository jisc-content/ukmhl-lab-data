SENILE GANGRENE. 227 fesses that lie had pursued the old routine, both of external and internal remedies, for fifteen years, the cases whether of arteritis or ossification constantly getting worse under their influence. At length, light broke in upon him from a patient m the Hotel Dieu, a female between sixty and seventy, with senile gangrene affecting the toes of the left foot, pre- ceded by long and severe pains, which had prevented rest for several months. The ends of the toes were mortified and dry, the neighbouring part of the foot swelled and livid. During several weeks, bark and opiates were used both internally and externally, without effect. The mortification spread along the toes, and the sole and back of the foot. M. Dupuytren having found the pulse full and strong, and the face red, ordered venesection. The pain ceased, sleep was restored, and the mortification stopped. At the end of a fortnight the bleeding was repeated, and it was had recourse to whenever the symptoms returned. The patient recovered. Since that time, says M. Dupuytren, we have employed repeated bleedings with the effect of relieving and curing two thirds or even three fourths of our patients (<Le9ons orales/ vol. ivâ€” ' Dictionnaire de Medecine/ p. 10. Although I have seen a few instances in which great pain of the foot with constitutional disturbance has been effectually relieved by venesection, I regard such cases as exceptional, and cannot consider repeated bleedings to be a proper general mode of treating senile gangrene. Mr. Pott's plan of em- ploying opium answers admirably when the pain is severe, as the remedy thus administered gives ease and rest without dis- turbing the head or stomach, or causing costiveness. When there is no pain, opium is unnecessary. The diet should be nutritious and light, without stimuli, the latter being allowed occasionally. To urge on the patient full animal diet, with free use of stimuli, is a relic of the ancient injudicious routine

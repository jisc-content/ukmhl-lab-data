TKEATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 107 with rhubarb. As medicines act better in combination than singly, acids may be given with tonics and bitters; the vegetable infusions may be combined with ammonia and tinctures.

Or, the inflammation, having still the usual symptoms, may have a milder character and slower progress from the be- ginning.

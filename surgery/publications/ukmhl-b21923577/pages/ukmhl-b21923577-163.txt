SUPPURATION. 143 flamed part constitutes an abscess (from abcedere, to depart. (Celsus.) The formation of matter is not confined to the circum- stances now alluded to; it may take place in other and dif- ferent cases. 1. On the denuded surface of inflamed cutis, as after scald or blister. 2. On the surface of inflamed mucous membrane ; that is, a fluid, with all the sensible characters of pus, not distinguish- able from it by appearance, is exhaled from such membranes when inflammation has reached a certain extent. 3 and 4. On the surfaces of inflamed serous and synovial membranes. 5 and 6. On the surface of wounds, when they are repaired by granulation, and on that of ulcers. The term abscess is applied only to collections of pus, excepting however those which take place in the regular or normal cavities, such as those of the pleura or peritoneum; â–  when pus or any other fluid is poured out into these, we call it an effusion. Seeing suppuration ordinarily as a result of inflammation, we are led to inquire whether it is so invariably. Whether' when we find pus, we may be sure that there either is, or has been inflammation of the part. In the abscess of acute inflammation, in the formation of pus by mucous, serous, and synovial membranes, and by denuded cutis, the point is unequivocal, the pus is the pro- duce of inflammatory disturbance. The case is different with the granulations of wounds and ulcers, which are healing those granulations are not inflamed, though they present increased vascular activity, a condition analogous to that of inflammation. In certain abscesses, as I shaU expla- hereafter, we fail to observe any symptoms of previonPs or

CHAPTER XIII. SCALDS AND BURNS. The application of heat to the human body will cause, according to its degree, slight inflammation, mere redness of the skin (erythema); more considerable inflammation, with vesication, without or with subsequent mortification of the skin, either superficial or in its entire thickness; or complete disorganization and death of the affected parts to a less or greater depth, according to the intensity of the heat and the duration of its application. The term scald is applied to the injury caused by hot water and other similar liquids, where the heat is not greater than 212Â° Fahr., the boiling point of water. The transient application of hot water causes inflammation and vesication, that is, the elevation of the cuticle by a serous fluid effused from the capillaries of the skin, similar to that caused by blistering. If the application be continued, it excites violent inflammation, with superficial mortification as its result. Other liquids, such as oil and resinous matters, which are susceptible of much higher temperature than water, and great heat in other shapes, kill the parts, reducing them to a black, firm mass, which shrinks and curls up as far as its connexions with the living parts will allow. This brown or black disorganized substance, is called an eschar. Eax<>Pa 13

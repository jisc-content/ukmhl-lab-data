DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSIC AND SURGERY. 11 ministrations, employed either successively or in conjunction, is often followed by a surgical operation. In many instances it is a mere question of degree, whether internal remedies shall be trusted to alone, or whether bleeding, cupping, leeches, &c, shall be added. Thus a slight affection of the head may be removed by purgatives and abstinence ; while a more serious degree of the same affection may require, in addition, abstraction of blood, either generally or locally; or indeed an opposite method of treatment, by the administration of stimulants.

If our profession were reduced to this, it wotdd no longer be necessary to study its scien- tific principles. We might spare ourselves the trouble of learning anatomy, physiology, pathology, and therapeutics j and we might well resign into the hands of our old associates, the barbers, tbe contemptible remnant to which surgery svould then be reduced. In considering the subject historically, we cannot deny that surgery consisted originally of this limited, mechanical, md subordinate department, which was exercised under the lirection, and by the permission of physicians â€¢ but surgeons We long emancipated themselves from this bondage, and will lever again submit to such ignominious trammels.

NATTJKE OF THE POISON. 477 periods, sometimes several years. In gonorrhoea there is in- flammation of the mucous membrane of the urethra or vagina, without breach of surface. This is more considerable in extent than the syphilitic ulcer; it goes through a certain course, coming to a natural end, being confined to the parts first affected, and not in general attended with further influence on the constitution. These two diseases seem totally unlike, and the inference that naturally presents itself to the mind from contemplating the subject in this view would be, that they owe their origin to causes essentially different. They who believe that syphilis first arose about the time of the discovery of America, are still of opinion that gonorrhoea existed before that time, and that it was an old disease. We should have supposed that persons holding that opinion would think that gonorrhoea depended upon a poison different in its nature from that of syphilis. For if gonorrhoea existed from ancient times, and the poison that produces it is the same as that of syphilis, how did it happen that syphilis had not existed as long as gonorrhoea? The belief in the identity of the poison is incompatible with the notion that gonorrhoea Â» an ancient affection, and that syphilis is one of recent date. However, we see that some persons who believe in the recent origin of syphilis are still of opinion that the poison producing the two diseases is the same. This was the case with Mr. Hunter. He was a great advocate for the identity of the poisons; in fact, he asserts that they are the same, and that the difference between the two diseases arises merely from diversities in texture of the parts to which * - apphed; that is, if the poison come in contact with a mucous surface, such as that of the urethra or va, causes gonorrhea; if ^ a surface ^ J^ produces syphilis, primary syphilitic sores. If this wer th only difference in the two cases, it appears to me, in

60 INFLAMMATION, Acute inflammation is called also active, violent, or phlegmonous. The term « phlegmonous » was applied hy the Greeks to that active form of inflammation seated in the areolar tissue which leads to abscess. Chronic inflammation is called also languid, slow, or indolent; the vascular dis- turbance and redness are much less; the pain is slight; the inflammation frequently proceeds to a considerable extent before the patient is aware of its existence. But though the chronic may appear to be of much less consequence than the acute disturbance, it often produces more serious change of structure in the affected organs. But the varieties of inflammation are more numerous and important than would be represented by this simple division. Let us take, for example, the finger; there may be the common inflammatory excitement following a scratch or cut, erysipelas in its various forms, burn, chilblain, whitlow, gout, rheumatism; and differences, both as to degree and results, are noticed yet more abundantly in the affections to which the internal organs are subject. I Let us notice varieties in the absolute and relative degree of the changes usually regarded as essential characters. The redness varies in its tint; it may be bright scarlet or crimson, or, on the other hand, livid; the colour may m both instances be slight or intense. Those differences are in great measure dependent on the quantity of the capillary vessels. paction is highest and the eifusion m0»t uWunt tUc^ its corpuscles should float, you read of "blood-corpuscles chngmg to the a of their containing vessel, and aggregating there."

The cause of its production lies wholly m the m- fluence exerted on the blood by the textures themselves.

The change of structure does not continue limited to the organ originally affected; it extends sooner or later to the immediately surrounding structures, and to the neighbouring absorbent glands. About the same time ulceration takes place in the indurated part. Secondary disease is now developed in various forms in internal and remote parts of the body. Pain, emaciation, and serious constitutional dis- turbance arise, until the patient sinks under the aggravation of the local symptoms, and of this cancerous cachexia. • The original induration, constituting the first stage of the disease, has been called scirrhus or occult cancer, while the ulcerated state is termed, in common language, open cancer. The technical term, carcinoma, derived, according to Blancard,* from kclpkivoq, cancer, and vsjuh), depasco, pro- perly denotes .the ulcerated stage, though it is used in a more general sense as equivalent to cancer. Thus the essential character of the disease consists in the succession of these two states, the indurated and ulcerated, and in its destructive agency, both on the affected parts and on the patient's life. The character of hardness belongs to other affections ■ hence, as the term scirrhus implies merely a hard state, it has been applied to various diseased changes, which are innocent. It is still used in this general sense by Boyer, in his < Traite des Maladies Chirurgicales.' The mere circumstance of hardness, however, is not sufficient to characterise a class of diseases \ so that scirrhus, if used in this sense, would include affections totally dissimilar in their nature. Hence modern writers, in order to avoid confusion and mistakes, apply this term scirrhus to such hard disorganizations only as will become ulcerated, or by other extension of mischief destroy life.

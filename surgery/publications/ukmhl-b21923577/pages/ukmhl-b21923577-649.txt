629 EYE. its way through the upper part of the sclerotica, just behind the ciliary ligament, and formed a tumour the size of a walnut, covered by conjunctiva. A shred of retina was discovered among some loose fibrous substance. No trace of choroid was seen, nor of vitreous humour, although the morbid growth did not fill the interior of the globe. No unfavorable symptom occurred after the operation. The swelling of the lids subsided when suppuration was established; the wound healed, and she was discharged in perfect health on February 3rd. The unfavorable result of the case, however, is apparent from this portion of the brain, which has been forwarded to us by Mr. S. Freeman, of Stowmarket, the gentleman who attended her at the time of her death, which took place in the early part of this month (July), after a few days' illness. Within a week of her decease she had been able to walk a distance of fourteen miles. The brain, as might be expected in warm weather, reached us in a state not admitting minute examination; you see, however, a mass of black matter the size of a large walnut, in a kind of cyst at the base of the brain behind the orbit, pressing the left optic nerve and stretching the commissure. The carotid arteries are imbedded m its substance; the right is pervious, the left apparently obliterated at one point. The growth is partly of a grayish-brown colour, and partly black, and resembles the original disease in the eye. The soft parts remaining in the bottom of the orbit were sent with the brain; the remnant of the optic nerve formed a firm mass, with dark streaks in its substance, about as large as a small horsebean. The remaining portions of the other orbital uerves were healthy. The thorax and abdomen were not examined.

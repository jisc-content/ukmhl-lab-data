CHRONIC ABSCESS. 165 take a course towards the loins, or escape through the back of the pelvis. In the first of these cases the matter may- descend along the thigh to the knee; and I have seen more than seventy ounces of fluid evacuated by puncturing such a collection; in the third instance it may reach the ham. When matter has thus gravitated to a part distant from the spot where it was formed, it may be called an abscess in, but not of, the part. The want of tendency to come to the surface, and the ready disposition to spread, may render it necessary to discharge the contents of such abscesses by puncture. In other instances the cyst is dense and thick, so as to render fluctuation very obscure, or altogether imperceptible. From their slow growth, absence of pain, and firm feel, such swellings may be mistaken for solid tumours, and may be extirpated accordingly. Hence, in case of doubt, a prelimi- nary puncture should be made, which may save the patient from a severe operation. A man from Wales, came to St. Batholomew's Hospital, with a large, firm swelling in the neck, under the sterno- mastoideus, extending nearly from the angle of the jaw to the sternum. It was considered a solid swelling by all who saw it, and I removed it; when it was found to be a tough and thick cyst full of pus. A healthy female of forty had a firm swelling in the axilla, as large as a small orange, which had arisen gradually. I examined it carefully two or three times, and thinking it a fleshy tumour, appointed a day for its extirpation. Every- thing was prepared. I again examined carefully before placing the patient on the table, and fancied there might be fluid. I accordingly punctured, and discharged nearly &a tea- cupful of tolerably well-formed matter. I admitted into St. Batholomew's an elderly female, with an enlargement behind the sternum, supposed to be of a: aneur.

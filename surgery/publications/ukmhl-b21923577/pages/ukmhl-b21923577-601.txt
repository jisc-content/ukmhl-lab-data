581 DIAGNOSIS. Diagnosis.â€”In addition to the circumstance of fungus hsematodes being as strikingly characterised by softness as cancer is by hardness of structure, the two diseases are strongly contrasted in other important respects. While the latter is seldom seen under the age of thirty-five, the former occurs frequently in young subjects. It attacks the eye in infants of a few months, and probably occurs oftener in that organ during the first year than after that age ; it is common enough in adults and older subjects. I have seen the medullary disease fully developed in the testicle, removed by operation, relapsing, and proving fatal within the first year of a remarkably bulky, strong, and apparently healthy infant. From a child under two years, a testicle similarly disorganized was removed in St. Bartholomew's. After death which followed in a few months, there was a chain of dis- eased glands along the corresponding side of the pelvis and spine, numerous tubercles in the lung, and seven in the brain, the largest being equal in size to an orange, the smallest to a chestnut. They were of firm consistence, of dusky red colour with streaks of white, one was of a darker colour, having the appearance of a firm coagulum of venous blood. A complete contrast is found in the relative proportions of the two affections in the organs subject to both. This is seen in the cases of the mammary gland and testicle. Cancer is so common in the former, that the cases probably con- stitute a considerable proportion of the entire number of malignant affections; while the fungoid disease is very rare. Fungus haimatodes is of common occurrence in the testicle, in which cancer is almost unknown. The latter is ex- tremely rare in the eye, where the former is not infrequent. Indeed cancer is rare in all parts except the breast, while the medullary disease is more equally distributed over the several organs and structures. Fungus hamatodes, although

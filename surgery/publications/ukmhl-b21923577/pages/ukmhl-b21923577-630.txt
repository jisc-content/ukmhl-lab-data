The sutures were removed on the fifth day, when the edges of the wound were united throughout, and the feverish symptoms had entirely dis- appeared. She left the hospital July 9th, 1851, with the wound firmly united, the aperture in the roof of the mouth much re- duced in size, and interfering but little with articulation by the insertion of a piece of moistened bread into the orifice. There was not any increase of the disease on the opposite side.

These relics of the malady, which caused neither pain nor inconvenience, lessened very slowly, and at last entirely disappeared. She was fitted with a plate bearing a regular row of upper teeth; mastication and articulation were perfect, and no trace of the disease or operation was observable, either within the mouth or exter- nally.

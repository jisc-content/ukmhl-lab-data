The cause is incessant j it is applied day after day and year after year. When you interrogate a patient respecting his habits, he says that he is temperate, because he takes only some beer, a few glasses of wine, and some spirit daily.

But excess, or even imprudence in diet is not necessary to produce these unhealthy states, although it is a frequent cause, especiaUy among the rich. They may he brought on by circumstances which act primarily on the nervous system and disturb the digestion, assimilation, and nutrition secondarily. Mere bodily inactivity weakens the digestive organs, and interrupts or suspends the excretions.

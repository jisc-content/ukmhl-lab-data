In fome fubjecfls, the pyramidales are wanting; and as the obliqui externi are in general thofe which in cafes of hernia come to be moft connedled with the dif- order, we fhall here confine our defcrip-* tion to the anatomy of thefe only. The obliqui externi are two thin, broad mufcles: on their poflerior and upper parts they are flefhy; and tendinous on their anterior and lower parts. They origi- nate from the eighth, ninth, and inferior ribs, by flelhy portions which intermix in a ferrated manner with correfponding parts of the latifiimus dorfi, ferratus ma- jor anticus, pedloralis major^ and inter- cofhales: And afterwards becoming ten- dinous, they form the greateft part of all the anterior furface of the abdomen, and are inferred into the linea alba, the fpine of the os ileum, and into the os pubis.

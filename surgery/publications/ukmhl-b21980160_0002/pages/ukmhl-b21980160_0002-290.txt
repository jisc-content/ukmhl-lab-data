Of Hernm. Chap. V. 268 the peritonseum, fo here when in the fcro- tum they will be found covered by thepof- terior part of the bag, in their whole courfe from the commencement of that procefs down the groin to the telUcle. This pafTage from the cavity of the ab- domen to the fcrotum is in general very foon cut off, by a firm adhefion being pro- duced between the fides of the peritoneal procefs at its upper extremity where it de- fcends from the abdomen. What the caufe of this adhefion may be, is uncertain; per- haps it may proceed from fome flight de- gree of inflammation being excited upon the contiguous parts by the forcible pafTage of the teftis ; but whatever the caufe may be, the fa61 is, that at the time of birth this pafTage in general is completely obli- terated It * The defcent of the teftes from the abdomen Is a phenomenon very difBcult to account for, and its im- mediate caufe may probably always remain a myfteryj but (heir being in almoll every inftance found in the fprotum before birth, is a clear proof of their not be- ing forced down by the effedts of refpiration, as has teeu commonly fuppofed.

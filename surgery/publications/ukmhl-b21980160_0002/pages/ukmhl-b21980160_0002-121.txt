Sedl. II. Of Blood-letting. ioy> SECTION II. Of a Thrcmbus^ or Ecchymofs. have already dehred, that in the operation of blood-letting, the mem- ber fliould be retained in the very fame pofture it was in when the lancet was in- troduced, till the whole quantity of blood intended to be taken is evacuated. When this diredlion is not duly attended to, it commonly happens, that a fmall tumor is railed immediately above the ori- fice that I have heard even well-employed furgeons affert, that they have ufed one or two lancets only during the courfe of many years praÂ£l;ice, without ever having them touched by a cutler. But it is very certain, that every time a lancet is ufed, it mull be injured more or lefs ; fo that, as the prevention of pain is with moft patients a matter of no fmall confequence, I think it ought to be laid down as a fixed rule never to ufe the fame lancet twice, without putting it into the hands of a cutler. This I have long been in the pradlice of doing, not only with lancets, but with every cutting inftrument; and the trouble and expence attending it is very inconfiderable, when compared with the ad- vantages refulting from it.

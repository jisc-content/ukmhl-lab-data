TREATMENT OF VENEREAL WARTS. 1065 it. The discharges from growths appearing upon active secondary lesions, such as mucous patches, may give rise to the initial lesion of syphilis. Treatment.â€”Venereal warts frequently disappear if the exciting cause, such as an irritating discharge, is removed, and the parts are kept clean and dry, for moisture is an important factor in their production. Cleanli- ness and the use of drying powders, such as oxide of zinc, boric acid, and lycopodium, will often be followed by their disappearance. In cases of disseminated warts, particularly those of the horny variety, painting them with the following solution will usually promptly cause their removal: ext. cannabis indicse, gr. x ; ac. salicylic, gr. x ; collodion, Sss. If, however, the masses are large, their removal is best accomplished by excision or cauteri- zation. They may be excised with the knife or scissors ; an objection to this method is the free bleeding which occurs, but this can soon be controlled by pressure, after which the surface from which the growths have been removed should be touched with carbolic or nitric acid and dusted with powdered iodoform or aristol. When excision is objected to, cauterization with the actual cautery, or with nitric or chromic acid, may be employed. Growths complicated with phimosis require splitting of the prepuce or circumcision before they can be successfully exposed for treatment. The large growths which occur during pregnancy should be treated by disinfec- tant and antiseptic lotions, and, as a rule, should not be subjected to opera- tive treatment, as they often disappear spontaneously after labor.

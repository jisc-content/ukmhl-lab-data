TREATMENT OF SARCOMA. 113 rapidly growing sarcomata are sometimes marked by local heat and acute, throbbing pain, but the lack of infiltration in the neighborhood of the ordinary sarcoma will distinguish it sufficiently from inflammatory disease, and its growth is rarely so rapid as that Fig. 76. of inflammation. The principal difficulty Osteosarcoma of pelvis. (Dr. R. Abbe.) Osteosarcoma of scapula. tions, such as syphilis, actinomycosis, and tubercle. The recognition of epithelial growths will depend largely upon the fact that such tumors must take their origin from epithelial tissue, and primary epithelial tumors cannot occur in the bones or the lymphatic glands, nor are they so frequent in the subcutaneous tissue as sarcomata. A sarcoma generally presents more or less rounded surfaces of varying consistency, hard in one part and soft in another, and the tumor is usually partly encapsulated, and often movable at first, whereas the epithelial growths are generally of stony hard- ness, and liable to become adherent to the skin or mucous membranes even before the latter are actually involved. Enlargement of the glands in the early stages indicates that the growth is epithelial, although this rule is not invariable, nor is the age of the patient altogether to be relied upon, for sar- coma may appear late in life, although it is much less common than the epithelial tumors at that period. In many cases the excision of a fragment by the knife or by Warren's punch for microscopic examination will be the only means of determining the real nature of these growths. Positive evidence of malignant disease may be thus obtained, but if the result of the examination is negative it should be accepted with a certain reserve, because the examination of small portions is not always satisfactory, for the tumor may vary in structure in different parts.

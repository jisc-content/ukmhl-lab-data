The internal lateral ligament is lengthened, and the external ligament shortened, with similar changes in the inner and outer groups of muscles. Flat-foot is often associated as a cause or as a result of the deformity. As has been already mentioned, rickets is the most common primary etiological factor. The deformity usually appears when the child begins to walk. In standing in the so-called aattitude of rest'' the weight is borne on the external condyles, and in the ra- IlG- 598, chitic child, the bones being preternatu- Genu valgum, or knock-knee. Unilateral knock-knee. of the external condyle and an increased growth of the internal condyle. At the same time the internal lateral ligament is lengthened by the strain upon it. Adolescent knock-knee develops in patients with relaxed mus- cular systems whose occupations necessitate much standing and walking. Other rarer causes are fiat-foot, infantile paralysis, arthritis, and traumatism. Symptoms.â€”Besides the unsightly deformity, there may be pain in the knees and a tendency to fatigue upon slight exertion. In unilateral knock- knee with much deformity (Fig. 599) there may be limping, obliquity of the pelvis, and a development of lateral curvature. In double knock-knee the gait is a rolling one. In marked cases of knock-knee we have seen ulcers form over the inner condyles from pressure and friction in walking. When the legs are flexed upon the thighs the deformity largely disappears. This is due to the fact that the condyles are altered in length but not in

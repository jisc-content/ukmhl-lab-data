OCCLUSION OF BLOOD-VESSELS. 77 Occlusion and Repair of Blood-Vessels.â€”When an artery is ligated, a clot forms at the seat of ligature and speedily becomes penetrated with endothelial cells, produced by the multiplication and emigration of those lining the vessel. Simultaneously with this there is an exudation around the outside of the vessel in which the granulation-tissue is formed, and the latter absorbs the exudate, penetrates the artery where it is ligated, or enters the ends of the divided vessel, and replaces the internal clot. There is also a proliferation of the connective tissue and of the muscular cells of the vessel-wall. After several months the result is a cicatrix, which forms at the point of injury and in which every layer of the vascular wall is represented, although the connective tissue is in the preponderance. Veins are occluded in a similar way. Primary union of the edges of a lateral wound in a vein, and even in an artery, has been shown to be possible in man. Circular suture of the ends of a vessel divided transversely has also been successfully performed. The reunited vessel remains pervious if it is a vein, but becomes slowly occluded by endothelial growth if it is an artery. The union of wounds of vessels is undoubtedly obtained by con- nective-tissue growth, followed by restoration of the walls in all their ele- ments, and it makes apparently very little difference whether the endo- thelial surfaces or the surfaces of the adventitia are brought into contact by the suture, although later experimenters prefer the latter, for it is very important that the sutures shall not be exposed in the lumen of the vessel, as a clot would form about them.

294 SYME'S AMPUTATION. AMPUTATIONS AT THE ANKLE-JOINT. Syme'S Amputation.—In performing this amputation the foot should be at a right angle to the leg, and an incision should be made from the centre of one malleolus, directly across the sole of the foot, to the centre of the opposite malleolus ; the tissues of the heel are next carefully dissected from the bone by keeping the knife close to the osseous surface until the tuber - Fig. 231.

The two extremities of the first incision are then joined by a transverse one across the instep, and, the joint being opened, the lateral ligaments are divided to complete the disarticulation ; the knife is next used to clear the malleoli, and these with the articulating surface of the tibia are removed with a saw. In dissecting out the os calcis and making the heel-flap, great care should be taken to keep close to the bone, so as not to destroy the vascular connections of the flap. The stump resulting from this amputation is an excellent one, and is often useful without an artificial limb. (Fig. 232.) Pirogoff's Amputation.—In this amputation all the tarsal bones are removed except the posterior portion of the os calcis. In per- forming Pirogoff's amputation an incision is carried from the tip of the inner malleolus, over the in- step, half an inch in front of the anterior edge of the tibia to a point half an inch in front of the tip of the outer malleolus. A second incision crossing the sole of the foot and carried down to the bone, uniting the extremities of the first incision, is next made. The plan- tar flap thus made is dissected back for a quarter of an inch, the joint being opened by dividing the lateral ligaments, the astragalus is disarticulated, and Pirogoff s amputation of the foot.

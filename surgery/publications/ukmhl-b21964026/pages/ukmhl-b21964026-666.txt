EXCISION OF THE WRIST-JOINT. 640 has upon its posterior and lateral aspects skin, fascia, and tendons, and upon its anterior aspect, in addition to these structures, are important nerves Fig. 563. Resection of the lower end of the radius. and blood-vessels. Their presence renders excision of this articulation an operation accompanied by more or less difficulty. (Fig. 564.) Operation.â€”The wrist-joint may be excised by making a dorsal in- cision beginning at the middle of the ulnar border of the second meta- carpal bone and carried upward about Fia 564- four inches (Fig. 565), crossing the ulnar edge of the tendon of the extensor carpi Fig. 565. Articulations of the wrist. Incision for excision of the wrist. (After Stimson.) radialis brevior and splitting the dorsal ligaments of the wrist between the tendons of the extensor secundi internodii and the extensor of the forefinger. The incision should be carried down to the bone, and the soft parts and tendons dissected loose with an elevator. By flexing the hand the first row of the carpal bones is made to present in the wound, and the scaphoid is separated from the trapezium and removed, the trapezium and pisiform being left if possible. In removing the second row of the carpal bones the knife should be passed between the trapezium and the trapezoid, and then into the carpo-metacarpal joint, cutting the ligaments of the dorsal side of the ends of the metacarpal bones, when the trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform can be taken away. The lateral ligaments are carefully divided,

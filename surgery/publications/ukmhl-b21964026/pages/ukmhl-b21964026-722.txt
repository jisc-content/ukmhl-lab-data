696 FEACTURES OF THE SKULL. Penetrating Fractures.—When a pointed or sharp-edged body strikes the skull, the outer table gives way, and the diploe may also be injured. If the for •ce is then exhausted, the inner table may not be injured, but if the force continues to act, the inner table may be fractured also. (Fig. 638.) If the momentum is sufficient, the inner table may be perforated, fragments from it being displaced like those of the outer table or driven far Fig. 638. Fracture through the frontal suture. Depressed fracture of the skull produced by a (After Agnew.) hammer. (After Agnew.) inward and left detached in the brain. In these penetrating fractures the opening may be clean cut and without any surrounding fissures. Perforating wounds made by missiles of high velocity, such as bullets, present the same difference in the inner and outer tables as similar wounds of the soft parts, the wound of entrance being smaller than the wound of exit, (Fig. 639.) The outer table will be less extensively injured than the inner as the bullet Fig. 639. b Gunshot fracture of the skull: a, external perforation ; b, internal splintering. (Agnew.) enters the skull, and the inner table less extensively injured as the bullet leaves it. When a blunt object of rather small area strikes upon the surface of the skull, the outer table is depressed and the diploe crushed, while the inner table may be simply fissured or may be depressed, the fissures or de- pressions being more extensive than those upon the outer table.

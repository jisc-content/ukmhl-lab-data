In cases where it is impossible completely to cover a large raw surface or ulcer, much time may be saved in the healing and contrac- tion may be avoided by sliding a flap with a pedicle from each side of the wound or ulcer, and suturing them so as to form a bridge of tissue across the gap, as shown in Fig. 174.

Reverdin's Method.â€”This consists in applying to a granulating sur- face small flat pieces of epidermis ; small grafts not larger than an eighth or a twelfth of an inch in diameter, including only the superficial epithelium of the skin, should be employed, being taken from the skin of a recently ampu- tated limb, or from the skin of the patient himself, or from another subject. The grafts may be cut with a sharp scalpel or razor, and should be directly transferred to the granulating surface and placed with their raw surface in contact with the granulations. To insure success, the granulating surface should be in a healthy condition ; if there is profuse discharge of pus from the surface the grafts are apt to be floated off, and the procedure is likely to fail. The use of antiseptics also prevents the successful taking of the grafts, and therefore in this procedure asepsis should be practised. In em-

PHAGOCYTOSIS. 19 matory focus. Many good observers agree (Grawitz, Shakespeare) that under the stimulus of inflammation many cells appear in the lymph-spaces of the tissues which must have been present previously, although invisible under ordinary circumstances, existing in a ''slumbering" state in which they are indistinguishable from the fibres of the connective tissue. This discovery accounts for the immense numbers of cells which suddenly ap- pear as if by magic around any inflammatory agent, for it would seem im- possible that emigration and multiplication of fixed cells in the ordinary manner could furnish such quantities of new cells. The wandering cells, however, are almost entirely made up of the leucocytes, of which three forms are known. These three forms are : first, a small round cell with a nucleus so large as to occupy the entire cell; secondly, a similar round cell of much greater diameter, with a single nucleus not so large in proportion ; and, thirdly, a round cell as large as that last described, but with several nuclei all united by a narrow band of protoplasm. This third cell is much the most numerous both in the blood and in the exudate, forming in the latter over three-quarters of all the cells present. Phagocytosis.—The object and effect of the emigration of leucocytes in inflammation are still subjects of dispute. The leucocytes surround any Fig. 15. • .'.f Outline lost. 1.15 Phagocytosis.

This taking up of particles by the wandering cells is called phagocy- tosis (Fig. 15), a process which some observers look upon as more or less accidental, while others, and in particular Metchnikoff, consider that it is

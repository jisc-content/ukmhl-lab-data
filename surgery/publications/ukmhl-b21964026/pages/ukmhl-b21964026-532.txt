UNUNITED FRACTURE. 506 allows of a considerable amount of mobility between the ends of the bone. (Fig. 430.) This is by far the most common variety of ununited fracture. Pseudarthrosis.—Another variety of ununited fracture which is occa- sionally seen is that in which a false joint is formed at the seat of fracture. The new joint is of the ball-and-socket type, one fragment being rounded and the other hollowed out. The surfaces of the bone are smooth and covered by fibrous tissue or fibro-cartilage, and a more or less completely Fig. 430.

This variety of ununited frac- ture probably results from prolonged motion in cases of transverse fracture in which close fibrous union was originally present. (Fig. 431.) Treatment.—It should be remembered that non-union in the bones of the lower extremity, even if permitting only a slight degree of motion, is followed by more disability than results from non-union in the bones of the upper extremity. A patient with a moderate amount of motion in an un- united fracture of the shaft of the humerus, radius, or ulna will often have a fairly useful arm, while a corresponding amount of motion in the shaft of the femur or tibia will interfere very markedly with locomotion. Various methods of treatment have been recommended and practised for the relief of ununited fracture, such as friction of the ends of the bone, drill-

569 TREATMENT OF DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. a position that the muscles inserted into the upper extremity of the humerus which are rendered tense by the displacement will be relaxed, and the head of the bone will be moved into its normal position. Reduction FlG- 494- of the many dislocations of the head of the humerus may be accomplished without the use of an anaesthetic, but the manip- ulations are painful, and the muscular resistance is often so marked that it is wise to admin- ister an anaesthetic. In reducing a dislocation of the humerus by manipulation, the patient should be placed in the recumbent posi- tion and anaesthetized, and the forearm flexed upon the arm, to relax the long head of the biceps muscle; the arm is next grasped at the elbow and abducted, and raised so as to bring it to the side of the patient's head, thus relaxing the deltoid and supraspinatus muscles. The surgeon should next place the fingers of the other hand upon the head of the humerus, which can be felt under the skin in the axilla, and as the arm is drawn out- ward and brought to a right angle with the chest the head of the bone is lifted into its socket. Kocher's Method. â€”In reducing a dislocation of the head of the hu- merus by this method the elbow is flexed at a right angle and pressed closely against the side ; the forearm is then turned as far as possible away from the trunk, causing external rotation of the arm.

Third manipulation in Kocher's method. the humerus does not roll outward in front of and below the acromion during this manipulation, the attempt will fail. While the external rotation is

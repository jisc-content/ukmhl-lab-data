CARCINOMA OF THE LIDS. 805 tarsal tumor. The tumor consists of a firm, small swelling attached to the tarsus, over which the skin is freely movable. On the conjunctival surface a discolored patch marks its position. Treatment.â€”The growth may be excised through the skin layer pre- cisely as one would remove a small sebaceous cyst, care being taken not to puncture the conjunctiva. Usually, however, it is sufficient to evert the lid, make prondnent the discolored conjunctival patch, incise this with a sharp scalpel, and thoroughly curette the cavity with a small scoop. A clot of blood forms in the place of the contents of the chalazion, and is absorbed in a few days. The malignant growths which may appear upon the eyelids are sarcoma, carcinoma, and lupus. Sarcoma occurs usually in children, as a primary growth, generally at first slightly elastic, but with a tendency to rapid growth, ulceration, and involvement of the orbit. Its early removal is urgently indicated. Carcinoma may appear as a rodent ulcer, the growth be- Fig. 703. ginning as a pimple, generally on the under lid, and slowly spreading, with indurated edges, until gradually it involves not only the lid but the eye itself and the surrounding tissues. (Fig. 703.) Instead of rodent cancer, the ordinary squamous-celled epi- thelioma may develop, espe- Fig. 702. Cavernous angioma of eyelid. A Rodent ulcer of twenty years' standing.

For epithelioma the only proper remedy is excision, and generally this necessitates an extended blepharoplastic operation. Chloracetic acid is a useful caustic in rodent ulcer. Lupus may attack the eyelids. It requires the treatment which is else- where described.

AMPUTATION OF METATARSAL BONES. 290 Fig. 224. Fig. 225. webs of the toes. This flap is next dissected back as far as the articulations, each of which is opened upon its dorsal surface. (Fig. 224.) When all the bones have been disarticulated the toes are flexed, and the knife is car- ried behind the articulations to the plantar aspect of the foot and made to cut a flap from the under surface of the phalanges as far forward as the web of the toes. A number of metatarsal branches of the plantar arch will require ligatures, after which the flaps should be brought together and secured by sutures. The appearance of the stump after the removal of all the toes is shown in Fig. 225. Amputation of the Metatarsal Bones.—In am- putating the metatarsal bones it is better to leave the tarsal heads of the metatarsal bones in place and divide the bones with bone-pliers or a saw; in other words, to do an operation in continuity to prevent opening the tarsal articulations. In am- putating, therefore, through the metatarsus, a short dorsal flap, slightly convex downward, is cut from one side of the foot to the other, and is dissected up j a long plantar flap is next cub in the same manner, and when this has been freed from the bones a saw is applied and the bones are divided. After securing any bleeding vessels the flaps are brought together with su- tures, and the cicatrix will be upon the dorsum of the foot. Amputation of the Great Toe with its Metatarsal Bone.—In removing the great toe with its metatarsal bone an incision is made upon the Fig. 226. Amputation of all the toes. (After Es- march.)

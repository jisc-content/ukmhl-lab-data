903 TUMORS OF THE BREAST. ladonna plaster, shaped to fit the breast and worn for some time, often gives the patient relief. In a few eases, when a distinct mass can be found, the pain is relieved by its excision. TUMORS OF THE BREAST. Lipoma, angioma, and chondroma are occasionally met with in the breast, but are of rare occurrence. The benign tumors ordinarily found are fibroma, adenoma, and certain cysts, and the malignant new growths are sarcoma and carcinoma. Myxoma and endothelioma form an intermediate class. Over eighty per cent, of the tumors of the breast are carcinomatous. A pure fibroma or a pure adenoma is a rarity, forming a well-encap- sulated tumor, from the size of a hazel-nut to that of an English walnut, existing in the breast without symptoms, and usually discovered by acci- dent. The great majority of tumors of this nature are mixed, containing fibrous and epithelial tissue in varying proportions, although the latter is often not increased in amount, and is simply the remains of the normal gland-tissue surrounded by the fibrous neoplasm. We shall, therefore, de- scribe a fibro-adenoma as the typical form of these tumors. Pibro-Adenoma.—Pathology.—Fibro adenoma of the breast is of two varieties. Ordinary Form.—In the first form the stroma of the breast is thickened into fibrous bands, arranged in concentric layers or in bundles of interlacing fibres, enclosing between their meshes acini and ducts, either normal or slightly altered by pressure or stretching. These tumors vary in size from small nodules to masses infiltrating a quarter of the breast. Fig. 760. Intracanalicular fibroma of the breast. X 100. (F. C. Wood, M.D.l They are usually well encapsulated, but in some cases there is no very dis- tinct limit between the diseased tissue and the surrounding healthy gland, the intermediate portion representing sometimes the changes found in chronic mastitis, although with rather less cellular infiltration.

509 DEFORMED UNION IN FRACTURE. Deformed Union.—This complication after fractures may result from imperfect reduction at the time of the accident, or from secondary displace- ment caused by the use of improper dressings, allowing motion at the seat of fracture. (Fig. 438.) Faulty or deformed union cannot in all cases be credited to the surgeon, for where there is great swelling it may be impos- sible with the utmost care to recognize the displacement of the fragments, and in some cases the bones are crushed or comminuted so extensively that it is impossible to restore their shape, or the obliquity or the irregular line of the fracture may prevent the restoration of the shape of the bone. In fractures complicated with flesh wounds, burns, or scalds, it may be impos- sible to apply any retentive apparatus; the patient also may remove or interfere with the dressings and splints, or suffer from mania or delirium tremens, which conditions may prevent coaptation of the fragments or lead to secondary displacement and result in deformed union. Treatment.—The treatment of deformed union, if it interferes with the usefulness of the part, consists in correcting the deformity by refracturing the bone if possible. If the fracture is not solidly Fig. 438. united, it may often be corrected by bending the bone Deformed union after Deformity after fracture of the femur corrected by osteotomy, fracture of the femur. (Ag- new.) Paris. In some cases where the deformity is marked and union at the seat of fracture is firm, a linear or cuneiform osteotomy may be employed with advantage. In a case of deformity after fracture of the femur (Fig. 439) we resorted to osteotomy to correct the deformity, and the satisfactory result obtained is shown in Fig. 440.

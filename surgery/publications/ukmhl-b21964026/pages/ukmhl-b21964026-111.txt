LIPOMA. ft:} particles of fat included in it, very like the subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 53), but in some cases the stroma is much more abundant and the amount of fat much less. When the two are equal in amount the tumor should be called a fibrolipoma. The fibrous tissue also forms a capsule, but the meshes of the stroma often pass through the capsule, and are continuous with the stroma of the normal subcutaneous tissue, extending up into the corium. The capsule is sometimes wanting, and a diffuse lipomatous growth results without any definite limit. Occurrence.â€”The most common situation of lipomata is in the sub- cutaneous tissue, but they are also found deep down among the muscles of the body or under the mucous membrane of the intestines. Lipomata are even found where fatty tissue does not exist normally (in the kidney and brain, for example), and their existence in such cases can be explained only Lipoma from the thigh, X *0. (Agnew.) by the assumption that some displacement of the foetal tissues has occurred. Subcutaneous lipomata are most common on the neck, the back, the upper parts of the extremities, and the abdomen. They are not usual on the head, and are rare on the feet and hands, only fifteen or twenty cases of the latter being on record. When they occur in the palm of the hand or on the plantar surface of the foot they tend to grow deeply between the bones and to project upon the opposite side, forcing the bones apart, and this peculiarity enables one to make the diagnosis between them and certain forms of chronic dis- ease of the tendon sheaths, which produce tumors of about the same size and consistency. Lipoma also occurs within the tendon sheaths and in the joints, or even in the bursce, and may simulate tuberculosis of these parts. Lipomata are quite common in the layer of fat which lies just without the

769 TUMORS OF THE JAWS. Osteomata Of the Jaws.—These tumors consist of localized out- growths of bone, and are more common in connection with the lower than with the upper jaw ; they may originate in the alveolar process, the body, or the nasal processes of the upper jaw. They may cause more or less pain, but are principally marked by the deformity and loss of function which their presence occasions. Treatment.—This consists in exposing the growth by an incision, and removing it by a saw or a chisel, or by a circular saw pro- pelled by the dental engine. Carcinoma of the Jaw.—Carcinoma of the epithelial type may affect the jaws, and is more common in the upper than in the lower jaw. The disease first appears in the gums, and rapidly involves the bone. The lymphatic glands are Fig. 682. affected early in the disease, and as the growth increases in size great deformity of the face re- sults. (Fig. 682.) Treatment.—As soon as the nature of the growth is ascertained, its re- moval should be promptly accomplished, the soft parts as well as the diseased bone being freely removed. Excision of one-half of the upper jaw is often demanded in these cases. In spite of free removal of the growth, recurrence is often rapid. Sarcoma of the Jaw.—These growths originate in the periosteum or the bone, may occur at any period of life, and are not uncommon in young children. They grow rapidly, causing carcinoma of the upper jaw. (Meats.) great deformity of the face, and recur quickly after removal. When originating in the body of the lower jaw (Fig. 683). they expand the inner and outer plates of the bone ; in the upper jaw they usually originate in the alveolar and nasal processes. (Fig. 684.) They are of the Fig. 683. Fig. 684. Sarcoma of the lower jaw. (Deaver.) Sarcoma of the upper jaw. (Willard.) spindle- and round-cell varieties. The former often contain tracts of hyaline cartilage, which have caused them to be classed with cartilaginous tumors. 49

4(iO FEACTURE OF INTERNAL CONDYLE OF HUMERUS. placement of the fragments or from the peculiar disposition of the callus resulting from the repair of the fracture. T-Fracture of the Condyles of the Humerus—This fracture consists in a transverse separation of the humerus through the condyles, with a vertical fracture extending into the articulation. (Fig. 371.) Causes.—T-fracture results from force applied to the back of the elbow while the arm is flexed, driving the olecranon forward against the condyles. Symptoms.—The most marked symptoms of this fracture are increased breadth of the elbow in consequence of the separation of the condyles, crep- itus elicited when the condyles are moved either backward or forward or when they are forced together, and mobility when the condyles are pressed in opposite directions. Fracture of the Internal Condyle of the Humerus.—Here the line of fracture is oblique to the longitudinal axis of the bone, and usually involves the joint to a greater or lesser extent. (Fig. 372.) Symptoms.—These are pain and rapid swelling, and upon extension the forearm is inclined inward, causing the deformity which is known as "gunstock deformity," resulting from the internal condyle being displaced upward. By grasping the internal condyle between the thumb and the fingers crepitus may be elicited, and preternatural mobility may be felt if the humerus and the forearm are moved laterally. Fracture of the External Condyle of the Humerus.—In this fracture the line of separation is usually oblique, and includes the articular surface of the humerus. (Fig. 373.) Symptoms.—The symptoms of this fracture are pain, swelling, de- formity, crepitus, and mobility. When the arm is extended it inclines to the ulnar side, Deformity in this fracture results from downward displace- ment of the external condyle. Fig. 371. T-fracture of the condyles of the humerus.

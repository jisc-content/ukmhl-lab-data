FRACTURES OF THE PHALANGES. 474 ment should always be attempted. By thorough sterilization of the parts and the removal of detached fragments it is possible for recovery to occur, with a more or less useful hand, even where there have been extensive com- minution and destruction of the metacarpal bones. Fig. 394. Splint and compress applied for fracture of the metacarpal bones. Fractures of the Phalanges of the Fingers.—Fractures of the phalanges of the fingers may involve the phalanges of a single finger or of several fingers. Fig. 395. Dressin the metacarpal bones. Symptoms.—The symptoms of this fracture are preternatural mobility and crepitus. As a rule, the deformity is not very marked and is easily reduced. Treatment.—In the treatment of fractures of the phalanges, after re- ducing the deformity by manipulation, a narrow padded splint is applied to the palmar surface of Fig. 396. the hand and of the in- jured finger; a posterior short splint, extending from the knuckle to the tip of the finger, may also be applied, the splints being held in position by the turns of a narrow roller bandage. (Fig. 396.) If there is lateral displacement, short lateral splints may also be employed in conjunction with the palmar and dorsal splints. A very satisfactory method of treating these fractures consists in moulding a piece of binders' board into the form of a gutter, which is padded with cotton and moulded to the palmar or Splints applied to fracture of the phalanx.

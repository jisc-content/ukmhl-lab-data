OPERATIONS UPON CICATRICES. 242 traction has ceased, which will be often as long as six months or a year after the healing of the wound ; the vitality of the scar-tissue will be usually at this time so well established that it will not be Fig. 169. likely to slough. In correcting the deformities resulting from contracted cicatrices, skin-grafting, preferably by Thiersch's method or a plastic operation, may be resorted to. The first step in these operations is the division or freeing of the contracted cicatrix, so that the parts which are held in a faulty position can be brought as nearly as possible into the normal position. In dividing these tissues it is well to remem- ber that, especially in contracting cicatrices about the joints, important nerves and vessels may be included in the cicatrix, and care should be taken not to injure them. Con- traction at the elbow following burn or scald of the anterior surface and forearm may be relieved by making an incision on each side of the contracted tissue and dissecting up the triangular mass of cicatrized tissue, afterwards bringing together the edges of the incision in the skin with sutures. (Fig. 169.) A similar procedure may be adopted in cases of contraction of the knee from a cicatrix. Operation for cicatrix at elbow. (Agnew.)

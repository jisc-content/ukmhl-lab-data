PROSTHETIC APPARATUS. 304 Artificial Legs.â€”In cases of partial amputations of the foot a shoe with a metal sole and narrow steel bands secured to the leg, and with a wooden block filling up the anterior portion of the shoe, corresponding to the por- tion of the foot removed, will constitute a satisfactory apparatus. In am- putations of the leg a more complicated form of prosthetic apparatus is required. In amputations at the knee-joint or through the upper part of the leg, the cheapest form of artificial apparatus which is employed is known as the "peg leg," or poor man's leg, which consists of a stout wooden stick, with an expanded upper extremity or socket composed of a conical piece of light wood, with two lateral splints embracing the thigh, the inner splint extend- ing only to the middle of the thigh, while the external one reaches to the pelvis and is fastened by a padded pelvic belt; a strap passing around the lower part of the thigh holds the inner splint to the outer one. (Fig. 247.) The front of the flexed knee rests upon a cushion between the two splints. In adapting an artificial limb in a case of amputation of the leg it is im- portant that no pressure be brought upon the surface of the stump, and that the weight of the body be supported by the thigh, the circumference of the leg, the inner border of the patella, the tuberosities of the tibia, and the tuberosities of the ischium. Many very ingenious forms of artificial legs have been manufactured which allow a certain amount of movement at the ankle and flexion and extension at the knee-joint. (Fig. 248. ) No satisfactory artificial apparatus can be adapted in cases of amputation at the hip-joint. Fig. 248. Peg leg. Artificial leg.

DIAGNOSIS OF TUBERCULOSIS OF THE SPINE. 532 Dorsal Tuberculosis.—Here there are usually present epigastric pain, pain upon concussion, rigidity of the spine, and grunting respiration. The presence of reflex spasm of the spinal muscles, confined to one side, can also usually be elicited. (Fig. 452.) Lumbar Tuberculosis.—In early disease of this region of the spine the attitude is usually erect, and there are some lordosis, rigidity of the spine, and pain in the course of the sciatic and anterior crural nerves ; reflex mus- cular spasm is also usually present.

The conditions with which spinal tuberculosis is most likely to be con- founded are: Rachitic curvature, which is frequently seen in children suf- fering from rickets: this curvature is a general one, involving the dorsal and lumbar regions, and disappears if the child is lifted by placing the hands in the axillse, reappearing as soon as he stands or assumes a sitting posture, and disappearing again when he is laid upon his belly. The ab- sence of rigidity and the disappearance of the curvature upon the manipula- tions mentioned serve to distinguish it from the deformity met with in tuberculosis of the spine. Erosion of the Spinal Column.—Aneurism may produce rigidity, but there is no deformity of the spine, and aneurism is not met with at the time of life at which spinal tuberculosis is most common. The characteristic signs of aneurism can usually be elicited by a careful examination. Malignant disease of the spine may produce rigidity, but is not apt to produce angular deformity. There is extreme pain in the course of the

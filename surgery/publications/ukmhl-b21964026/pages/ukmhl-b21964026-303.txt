AMPUTATIONS OF THE METACARPAL BONES. 279 carpal bone, it is better to make the palmar flap first by transfixion, the dorsal flap being made subsequently. (Fig. 203.) In this operation it is also necessary to keep the point of the knife close to the bone. Fig. 202. Amputation of thumb—racket-shaped in- cision. (Agnew.) Amputation of thumb by transfixing anterior flap. Amputation of the Little Finger and its Metacarpal Bone.— In amputating the fifth metacarpal bone an incision should be made along the inner border of the hand, and carried down to the bone between the skin and the abductor minimi digiti muscle; the lower end of the incision passes over the knuckle to the web of the finger, and backward under the palmar surface to join the first incision. The ligaments attaching the bone to its fellow should next be divided, and the bone should be raised from its bed and separated from the soft parts and disarticulated at its proximal extremity. After controlling the bleeding, the wound should be brought together by a few interrupted sutures. Amputation of the Hand at the Carpo-Metacarpal Joint.— Amputation of the hand at the carpo- metacarpal joint or between the rows of the carpal bones is occasionally re- sorted to. This procedure is not, as a rule, to be recommended, as the carpal bones are apt subsequently to become diseased and require removal. When this operation is performed, the hand should be placed in a state of extreme supination, and the point of a narrow knife should be entered on the palmar aspect of the hand, opposite the artic- ulation of the metacarpal bone of the little finger with the unciform bone, and pushed directly across the hand, between the bones and the soft parts, until its point emerges below the thumb (Fig. 204) ; the knife should then be carried downward, close to the metacarpal bones, and an elliptical flap Amputation of hand at carpo-metacarpal joint.

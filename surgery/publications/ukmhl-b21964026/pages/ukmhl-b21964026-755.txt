729 CEREBRAL LOCALIZATION. parallel to the folded edge, forming an angle of twenty-two and a half degrees. The first doubling is then unfolded, and the sum of the larger plus one of the smaller triangles makes sixty-seven and a half degrees (45 -f- 22s = 67j), which is near enough for practical purposes. The motor centres lie grouped about the fissure of Eolaudo as indicated in Fig. 653. To find the fissure of Sylvius (Fig. 653) Dana gives the rule : Fig. 653. Cerebral localization. imagine a vertical line from the stephanion to the middle of the zygoma, and then a horizontal line from the external angular process to the highest part of the scpaamous suture. The point of junction of these two lines will be the beginning of the fissure of Sylvius, and the vertical line will indicate nearly the position of the anterior or vertical branch of the fissure. The motor centre of speech lies just in front of the vertical branch of the fissure. (Fig. 653.) The temporal lobe, of which the fissure of Sylvius is the anterior or upper boundary, extends nearly as far forward as the posterior edge of the orbital process of the malar bone. (Fig. 650, TS.) The parieto- occipital fissure, or upper border of the occipital lobe, lies just above the lambda. The lower border of the temporal lobe corresponds to a line drawn from a point twelve millimetres above the zygoma and the external auditory meatus to the asterion (Dana). The temporal lobe is about four centime- tres wide at the external auditory meatus, and, according to Von Bergmann, a trephine applied half an inch above the meatus would enter the lower part of the lobe. (Fig. 650, B.) The middle meningeal artery follows nearly the course of the squamous suture anteriorly, and its anterior branch is given off at the pterion. (See page 714.)

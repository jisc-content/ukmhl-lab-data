PAROVARIAN CYSTS. 1208 and can hardly be distinguished from cysts of the parovarium itself. These cysts are usually bilateral. (4) Parovarian Cysts.â€”The parovarian cysts are unilocular, and are filled with clear serum or contain papillomatous growths. They may attain a large size. They are easily shelled out of the ligament, and the Fallopian tube is found on the upper surface of the ovary at one side. They usually come to operation between the six- teenth and twenty-fifth year of the pa- tient's age. The papillomatous growths of both varieties of proliferating cysts may perforate the capsule, and small portions may be transplanted, being carried into different parts of the peri- toneum, where they become fixed and grow. They even invade the blood- vessels, and are transferred to distant parts of the body, giving rise to meta- static growths in the lungs. True ma- lignant degeneration is also frequent in these tumors, an irregular epithelial growth beginning in the papillomatous parts and involving the entire cyst, or only a portion of it. In such cases it acquires all the characteristics of carci- noma. Adenomatous growth is also frequent in the papillomatous cysts, an overgrowth of the contained epithelium producing a structure more nearly re- sembling a normal ovary.

The mortality following this operation is very slight, hemorrhage and sepsis being very rare accidents. The result of osteotomy in the case shown in Fig. 598 is shown in Fig. 602. BOW-LEGS. Bow-legs, or genu extrorsum, is the opposite condition to knock-knee. The legs are bowed outward, and the deformity may be single or double, generally the latter. The shafts of the bones usually take the principal part in producing the deformity, the tibia especially being curved outward, and a forward bowing of the same bone may be associated. There is some- times obliquity also in the articular surface of the femur, with elongation of the external condyle. (Fig. 603.) Like knock-knee, it occurs as a result of the bone-changes in rachitis when the child begins to walk. Its production, according to Bradford and Lovett, is probably due to the position in which the rachitic child standsâ€”that is, with the lumbar spine arched and the thighs flexed. This produces a separation of the knees and a rotation of the femora, bringing the line of gravity inside the knee-joint and causing the

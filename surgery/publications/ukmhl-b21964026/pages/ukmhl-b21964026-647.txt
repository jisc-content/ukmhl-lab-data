TREATMENT OF HIP-DISEASE. 621 ease has been arrested the patient may have the hip-joint fixed by a moulded binders' board splint, with a high shoe upon the sound foot, and may be permitted to walk about on crutches for some time before he is allowed to use the limb in locomotion. Fixation and Traction Splints.â€”In cases of hip-disease among well- to-do patients, when the appliances can be under the care of an intelligent parent or nurse, fixation and traction splints are often most satisfactory ; by their use patients can go about and get change of air and scene, and the joint treatment can be carried on at the same time. The most inexpensive fixation apparatus for cases of hip-disease consists in a binders' board splint, moulded to the upper part of the leg, the thigh, and the pelvis, and secured in position by a bandage. In place of the binders' board splint a plaster of Paris bandage may be applied to the leg, the thigh, the pelvis, and the abdomen as high as the ribs. The patient should be fitted with a high shoe upon the sound foot, and should be allowed to walk about on crutches. Another form of fixation splint known as Thomas's (Fig. 546) is very largely used, and is applied as shown in Fig. 547. The patient wears a high shoe upon the sound foot and walks by the aid of crutches. This splint may be made of sole-leather, with steel braces, and is convenient in application and equally satisfactory in its results. Various forms of traction splints may also be applied. In these extension is made to relieve muscular spasm, and at the same time, in many of them, fixa- tion of the joint is secured. The splints of Taylor, Davis, Lovett, and Wyeth are con- Fig. 548.

An extension apparatus of adhesive or swans'-down plaster is applied to the leg and the lower part of the thigh ;

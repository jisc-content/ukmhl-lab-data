90 KELOID. FIBEOMA MOLLUSCUM. scar becomes stationary after a time and may grow smaller and flatter, and that the scar is not usually so bright red as the keloid is apt to be. The keloid forms a densely hard, flat tumor in the substance of the skin, some- times with a straight edge, but more frequently with claw-like projections reaching into the surrounding skin, whence its name. It may be white, but is usually pinkish in hue. It tends to spread slowly but steadily on all sides. Keloids are occasionally multiple, and form large warty tumors in some cases instead of flat patches. Certain individuals seem to have a predisposition to keloid, particularly in the negro race. Keloids appear on all parts of the body, but most frequently upon the front of the chest. Fig. 49. Spontaneous keloid. (Ohmann-Duinesnil.) Fibroma-molluscum is a curious tumor of the skin, consisting of a fibrous tumor starting in the corium, projecting through the epithelial layers, and forming a pedunculated growth. It is quite soft, and when pressure is made upon it in the early stages, when it does not project much beyond the level of the surrounding skin, there appears to be a gap in the skin at that point, through which the soft tissue projects. The tumors continue to grow until they reach the size of a small bean, and then the opening in the corium through which they have appeared to come grows smaller, cutting off their blood-supply, and the interior of the tumor softens and disappears, leaving only a bag of the upper layers of the skin at the point where the tumor originated. Finally, this shrivels up and disappears, so that in this

Sometimes it may be of use to have an assistant press the head outward with the fingers or by a band in the axilla during the latter manipulation. Reduction by Extension and Counter-Extension.—The reduction of dislocation of the humerus by extension and counter-extension may also be practised. This method consists in making counter-extension by placing the heel in the axilla while traction is made upon the arm downward from Fig. 497. Reduction by extension and counter-extension with the heel in the axilla. the arm or the forearm by the hands or an extending band. (Fig. 497.) The principal risk in this method is of injury of the axillary vessels. Mothe's Method.—This method of extension and counter-extension is also used in the reduction of dislocations of the head of the humerus.

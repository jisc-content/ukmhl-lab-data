112 DIAGNOSIS OF SARCOMA. Fig. 75. giant-cell variety. The presence of fibrous tissue or of true bone in a sar- coma also renders the prognosis better. The duration of sarcoma seems to be a very variable one. Some tumors run a course of great rapidity, the growth spreading through the tissues almost as rapidly as a purulent infiltra- tion, and secondary tumors appearing at once in distant organs. Others resemble a fibroma, growing very slowly, being encapsulated, giving abso- lutely no symptoms, and sometimes remaining stationary in size and without dissemination elsewhere for years, until a blow or some unknown cause brings out their malignant character. It is as yet uncertain whether these latter tumors are sarcomatous from the first or whether they are benign tumors in which a sarcomatous change takes place. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of sarcoma is to be made when a well encapsulated tumor originates from some part of the body which does not contain epithelial cells and grows rapidly, especially if it directly follows a severe injury. If the Fig. 74. <0t /' Myxosarcoma of thigh. ■ 't ' Osteosarcoma of femur. tumor is subcutaneous, the skin will not be involved or even adherent until late in the disease. If it originates in the skin, it may be learned that a wart or mole existed previously in that situation. The diagnosis may be made certain by excluding benign tumors, inflammatory swellings, and epithelial tumors. The first can usually be done by the short duration and rapid growth of sarcoma, and occasionally by its less distinct encapsulation. The diagnosis from inflammatory swellings is not always easy, because the

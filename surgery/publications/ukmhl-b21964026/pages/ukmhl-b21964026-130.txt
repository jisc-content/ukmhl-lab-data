110 METASTASIS OF SARCOMA. Metastasis.—The metastasis of sarcoma takes place by the growth pene- trating the blood-vessels, infection of the lymphatic system being infre- quent, although it is more common than usually supposed, as the glands have been found to be involved in about one-sixth of the cases of sarcoma of the breast. When the wall of a vein is attacked by the growth, a bud Fig. 71. .0 . 0 1# o o & 0 p m o 0 O if V ■ ° Osteosarcoma of humerus: a, lamellae of bone; 6, spindle-cell of the sarcoma; c, giant-cell acting as an osteoclast and causing absorption of bone.

Wood, M.D.) of sarcomatous tissue forms on its inner surface, and small particles or single cells may be swept away by the blood-current to other parts of the body, giving rise to secondary tumors wherever they are arrested, the dis- semination resembling that of pyaemia. (Figs. 72 and 73.) An embolus from such a tumor must pass the minute capillaries of the lungs before again entering the general circulation so as to cause secondary tumors elsewhere, Fig. 72.

It is not easy to explain how they ever escape, and yet the lungs are often found to be healthy even when secondary tumors are present else-

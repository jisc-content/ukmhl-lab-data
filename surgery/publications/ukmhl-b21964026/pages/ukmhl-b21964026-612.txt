586 DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP. Treatment.—The leg should be flexed upon the thigh, and the thigh carried up to a right angle with the pelvis. The limb is next abducted and rotated inward and carried across the abdomen towards the sound side and brought down in the position of adduction to the side of its fellow. (Fig. 522.) During attempts at the reduction of thyroid dislocations it is quite common for the head of the bone to pass below the acetabulum and convert the thyroid into an ischiatic or an iliac dislocation, in which event the reduction may be accomplished by adopting the manipulations for the reduction of iliac or ischiatic displacements. To prevent Fig. 520. Fig. 521. Thyroid dislocation of the femur. Deformity in thyroid dislocation of the femur. this complication during the reduction of thyroid dislocations a folded towel may be placed beneath the upper part of the thigh, and by raising the latter at the moment the limb begins to descend, the head of the bone may be prevented from slipping below the acetabulum. Fig. 523. Fig. 522. Reduction of thyroid dislocation of the femur. Pubic dislocation of the femur. Dislocation of the Hip Upward and Forward (Pubic).—In this form of dislocation, which is the least frequently seen, the head of the bone after escaping from the acetabulum rests upon the pubis internal to the

Compound Bandages.â€”Compound bandages are usually formed of several pieces of muslin or other material three or four inches in width, sewed or pinned together, and are employed to fulfil some special indication in the application of dressings to particular parts of the body. The most useful of the compound bandages are the T-bandages and many-tailed bandages. A single T-bandage consists of a hori- zontal band, to which is attached, about its mid- dle, another having a vertical direction ; the hori- zontal piece should be about twice the length of the vertical piece. (Fig. 98.) A single T-band- age is often employed in applying dressings to the anal region or the perineum, or as a means of securing a catheter in a perineal wound. An oblique T-bandage is often employed to hold dressings to hernia?, and consists of a strip of material secured around the waist, to which is fastened another strip obliquely so that it can be brought down over the seat of the hernia and passed under the inner side of the thigh and fastened to the horizontal strip upon the back. Double T-Bandages.--A double T-bandage has two vertical strips attached to the horizontal strip (Fig. 99), and may be used for much the same Single T-bandage.

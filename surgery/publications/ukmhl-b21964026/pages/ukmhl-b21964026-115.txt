95 MYXOMA. passed between the ribs to a similar tumor in the chest. These prolonga- tions should be carefully followed out and removed, or the tumor will grow again. Eemoval by operation is the only possible treatment. MYXOMA. Myxoma is a tumor formed of a tissue like the so-called Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord, which is not found in adult life except in the vitre- ous humor and in occasional degenerations of fat or bone. Its foundation consists of a transparent mucin-holding substance in which ramify stellate or fusiform cells with small round nuclei, the branches of the cells often communicating and forming a delicate reticulum. (Fig. 54.) Tumors of Fig. 54. Myxoma from the peritoneum, x 300. (Agnew.) this kind are found in the neighborhood of the umbilicus, in the subcuta- neous tissue, the brain, and other parts of the body. Myxoma is said to stand midway between the benign and the malignant tumors. Myxomatous tissue is often found as a partial ingredient of the sarcomata, but the pure myxoma is considered benign, and should be associated with the lipomata, for the fatty structures of adult life originate from myxomatous tissue in the foetus. These tumors are of little clinical significance, on account of their rarity, but should be removed for fear of sarcomatous degeneration. OSTEOMA. An osteoma is a tumor composed of bony tissue. Bony tumors attached to the external surface of bones are known as exostoses ; the term enostosis has sometimes been given to bony tumors projecting into the skull, grow- ing from its inner layer, but it should be reserved for bony tumors growing centrally in a bone.

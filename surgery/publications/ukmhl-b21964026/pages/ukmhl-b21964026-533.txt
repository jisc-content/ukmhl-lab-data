507 TREATMENT OF UNUNITED FRACTURE. ing and subsequent fixation, the use of mechanical apparatus, and ex- cision of the ends of the bone followed by fixation with sutures or metal splints. Friction.—This method may be employed in ununited fractures, and is often followed by good results, but should be reserved for comparatively recent cases. Drilling.—Drilling the ends of the fragments through a small puncture has been practised with success in many cases. If such treatment is adopted, care should be taken that the skin surrounding the seat of puncture is thor- oughly sterilized, as well as the drill with which the ends of the bone are perforated. The ends of the bone may also be freshened with an osteotome introduced through a small wound. This procedure we recently practised with a satisfactory result in a child who suffered from an ununited fracture of the femur. Fixation after either of these operations should be secured by splints or by the plaster of Paris bandage. Mechanical Apparatus.—In cases where an operation is not to be recommended, either from the risk that it entails or from the fact that the patient is in a debilitated condition or refuses operative treatment, mechani- cal apparatus may be employed with advantage. In ununited fractures of the humerus a moulded leather splint or a splint attached to a metal brace will often permit the patient very good use of the arm. In un- united fractures of the tibia and fibula a brace may be worn with comfort, and union may follow. In ununited fractures of Apparatus for ununited frac- Partial suture of bone.

In some cases after wearing such an apparatus for a time union has finally taken place at the seat of fracture.

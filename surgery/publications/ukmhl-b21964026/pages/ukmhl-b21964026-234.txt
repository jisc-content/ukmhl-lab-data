If a needle arrued with a double ligature is first passed under the growth, the ligature is divided; by passing each end of the divided ligature subeutaneously around the growth it may be strangulated subeu- taneously in two sections. Erichsen's Ligature.—This ligature is employed to strangulate growths of irregular shape in a number of sections. Strong silk or hemp ligature, three yards in length, one-half of which is stained black, is threaded into a needle as a double ligature. The needle is then passed under the the ends are then firmly tied, so as to strangulate the growth in a number of sections. (Fig. 158.) Elastic Ligatures.—Ligatures made of india-rubber of various thick- nesses are occasionally made use of in surgery. They may be used to stran- gulate growths, such as moles or naevi, or may be employed in the treatment of fistula. In applying an elastic ligature to a fistula the ligature, after being passed through the fistula by means of a probe, is carried out through the internal opening, and the ends of the ligature are tied firmly together; the greater the tension made before the ligature is tied, the more rapidly will it cut its way out.

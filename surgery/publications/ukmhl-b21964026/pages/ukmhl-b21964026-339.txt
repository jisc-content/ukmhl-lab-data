CHAPTER XV. 313 SURGERY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. The peripheral lymph-vessels are liable to injury, inflammation, occlu- sion, dilatation, or the development of tumors. Injuries of the lymph- vessels are, as a rule, of little importance, for, although it is questioned whether new vessels are formed in wounds, the anastomosis is usually so complete as to prevent stagnation of the current. Obstruction of the lymphatics is seen more frequently as the result of inflammation than of injury, manifesting itself by dilatation of the larger vessels and hypertrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, pro- ducing the condition known as elephantiasis. (Fig. 251.) The skin is rough, and the papilla? and folds are thick- ened, with a tendency to the production of warty outgrowths. The subcutaneous tissue is thickened, resembling oedema, but not pit- ting upon pressure. In rare instances the I Fig. 252. Elephantiasis of the leg; from chronic ulcer and inflammation.

The most frequent situation of this lym- phatic overgrowth is on the lower extremities and the genitals, although it has been observed on the upper extremities. The hypertrophy may reach such an extent as to make the limb several times its normal diameter, while the huge folds of the skin add to the deformity. This condition is some- times produced by the presence of parasitic filaria in the blood, which enter

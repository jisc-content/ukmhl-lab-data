HANDKERCHIEF BANDAGES. 176 HANDKERCHIEF BANDAGES. Bandages may be applied by means of handkerchiefs or square pieces of muslin for a temporary or permanent dressing in wounds or fractures. Many handkerchief bandages have been devised and employed, and for the application of temporary dressings, where the ordinary roller bandages cannot be obtained, their use will often prove satisfactory. Handkerchiefs may be folded so as to form an oblong or a triangle, or a cravat, or a cord. The names of the various handkerchief bandages are derived from the shape of the handkerchief used and the parts to which they are to be applied. The names serve as guides to their application. The handkerchief band- ages may be used to take the place of the ordinary roller bandage; for instance, the bis-axillary cravat may be used as a substitute for the spica bandage of the shoulder, and the mento-vertico-occipital cravat modified may be used to take the place of the Barton's bandage of the head.

The Mento-Vertico-Occipital Cravat.—This handkerchief is ap- plied by placing the base of the cravat under the chin and carrying the extremities over the vertex of the skull, crossing them at that point, then carrying them downward to the occiput and crossing them again here, passing them forward around the chin, and finally securing the ends by a knot or pin. The turns of this handkerchief correspond exactly to the turns of the Barton's bandage of the head, and may be used to secure dressings

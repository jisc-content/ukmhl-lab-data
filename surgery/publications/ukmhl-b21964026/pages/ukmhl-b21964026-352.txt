LOCAL TREATMENT OF HEMORRHAGE. 326 tions of these parts, being placed over the main artery some distance above the seat of operation. Many other forms of tourniquet may be employed, among the most useful being those which are constructed upon the same principle as Lister's tourniquet. (Fig. 258.) Elastic Constriction.—The elastic tube or strap of Esmarch's apparatus Fig. 258. Fig. 257. Petit's tourniquet applied to the femoral artery. (Agnew.) Lister's tourniquet. Fig. 259. is now very widely employed for the temporary control of hemorrhage (Fig. 259), but, if it is not at hand, a very satisfactory substitute may be impro- vised from elastic suspenders or garters, or from a rubber drainage-tube. In hemorrhage from wounds of the extremities, and in operations upon the bones, or for the removal of tumors, or in amputations, elastic constriction is employed with most satisfactory re- sults. By the use of the elastic strap or tube the circulation can be abso- lutely controlled; but care should be exercised in using this appliance to adjust it with just enough firmness to control the bleeding, and also to allow it to remain in place as short a time as possible, for from its too firm appli- cation the muscles have been divided, and nerve-trunks have been so severely injured that permanent paralysis has resulted. Paralysis of the vaso-motor nerves following elastic constric- tion of a part is very common, and is marked by free capillary bleeding. Haemostatic Forceps.—The employment of haemostatic forceps for the control of hemorrhage during operations is very general, and has done much to diminish the mortality of operations. The haemostatic forceps in general use is a self-retaining instrument which is clamped upon the bleeding vessel during the operation, and is allowed to remain in position until the operation Elastic strap.

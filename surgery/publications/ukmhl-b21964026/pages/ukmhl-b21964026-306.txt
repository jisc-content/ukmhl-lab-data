AMPUTATIONS AT THE ELBOW. 282 two oval antero-posterior flaps of skin and cellular tissue, and then, having retracted these, the muscles are cut through by a circular incision, and the bones are subsequently divided with a saw. (Fig. 209.) Fig. 208. Circular amputation of the forearm. (After Esmarch.) Teale's Method.—Teale's method is sometimes employed in amputa- tions of the forearm, but possesses no advantages over the methods pre- viously described. Fig. 209. Amputation of the forearm by modified circular method. (Bryant.) Amputations at the Elbow.—The methods of amputating at the elbow are the anterior flap, the elliptical incision, the lateral flap, and the circular method. Anterior Flap Method.—A flap three inches in length, its base par- allel to and half an inch below the condyles of the humerus, is cut by trans- fixion or from without Fig. 210. Amputation at the elbow, anterior flap method. (Agnew.) inward. (Fig. 210.) The joint is next opened and the lateral ligaments are divided. The olecranon is then exposed, the at- tachments of the triceps are separated, and a pos- terior flap is cut from little below the line of the without inward or from within outward condyles. The Elliptical Method.—In this method of amputating at the elbow an incision is carried from the olecranon process downward and forward to a point a little above the middle of the forearm. The incision is then continued

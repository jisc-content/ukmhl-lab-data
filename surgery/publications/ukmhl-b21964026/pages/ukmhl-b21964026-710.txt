Metatarsalgia.—Metatarsalgia is a neuralgic affection of the foot, which has been described by T. G. Morton, the pain radiating from the head of the fourth metatarsal bone. In this condition there is marked tenderness upon pressure, but there are no signs of inflammation. It is supposed to be due to crowding together of the heads of the metatarsal bones when lateral pressure is made, filaments of the plantar digital nerves being pressed upon. (Fig. 629.)

In severe cases the only treatment which gives permanent relief is excision of the metatarsophalangeal ar- ticulation of the fourth toe, or amputation of this toe, with re- moval of the head of the fourth metatarsal bone. Tarsalgia.—Tarsalgia is a neuralgic affection of the tarsus which occurs in those who are compelled to stand or walk constantly, and is probably due to relaxation of the ligaments ; it is frequently associated with flat-foot.

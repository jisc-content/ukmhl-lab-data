545 LEONTIASIS OSSEA. Fig. 469. Treatment.—In the early or developing stage of exostoses such reme- dies as arsenic, phosphorus, and cod-liver oil may be used with benefit. Operative treatment for their re- moval should be undertaken only when the growths cause great de- formity or interfere with the move- ments of adjacent joints. In re- moving exostoses the part should Fig. 470. Skiagraph of an exostosis of the tibia (Wil- lard) by Professor Goodspeed. Ungual exostosis. Fig. 471. be rendered bloodless by the use of Esmarch's bandage, and the greatest care should be observed as regards asepsis. The bony growth should be exposed by incision and the soft parts carefully separated, the periosteum being saved, to expose the base of the tumor, which should be sepa- rated from the bone by a chisel or by bone forceps. The removal of an ungual exos- tosis is accomplished by exposing the bony growth by incision and dividing its base with bone forceps, after its removal the skin incision being brought together by sutures. Leontiasis Ossea.—This is an affection which has been described by Virchow, characterized by hyper- ostosis of the facial and cranial bones. Large masses of bone develop from the facial or cranial bones. This change in the bones does not consist in a simple outgrowth, but the whole bone is hypertrophied or involved in the growth. (Fig. 471.) The principal symptoms of the affection are pain, great deformity, and loss of function, which is caused by the growths ; the eyes may be pushed from their sockets, and the nerves so compressed at their foramina of exit as to have their function arrested; loss of sight is not an uncommon complication in 35 Leontiasis ossea.

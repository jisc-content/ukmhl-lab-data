274 MULTIPLE AMPUTATIONS. Neuroma.—This is a painful enlargement of the nerves of a stump which is not infrequent, and is said to depend not so much upon the bulbous enlargement of the nerves as on a sclerotic condition of the same, giving rise to neuritis, which results from Conical stump after amputation of arm. Conical stumps after amputation of the legs. (Agnew.) any distinct painful enlargements of the nerves can be felt in the stump, they should be removed by incision, or re-amputation of the stump may be necessary if the condition gives the patient great discomfort. Contraction of Tendons.—Occasionally in certain amputations about the foot the stump is distorted by the contraction of tendons and is rendered practically useless. In such cases subcutaneous division of the tendons may be required. After Chopart's amputation of the foot, contraction of the muscles attached to the os calcis by the tendo Achillis may cause distortion of the stump, so that the cicatrix is pressed upon and becomes painful, or may produce so much distortion that a shoe cannot be worn. In such a case tenotomy of the tendo Achillis may be required. Necrosis.—This condition may be present after operation, and may result, as previously stated, from osteomyelitis. In such a case, as a rule, the amount of bone destroyed is ex- tensive, and a long tubular seques- trum forms, which may require re- moval subsequently. (Fig. 196.) On the other hand, a limited amount of necrosis may result, unattended with any marked constitutional disturb- ances, which is probably due to the injury produced by the saw at the time of the division of the bone. MULTIPLE AMPUTATIONS. In multiple injuries of the extremities it occasionally becomes necessary to remove two or more limbs at the same time by primary amputation. The cases calling for multiple amputation usually result from machinery Fig. 196. Tubular sequestrum from stump. (Agnew.)

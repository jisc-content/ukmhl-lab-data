LIGATION OF THE POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 395 the artery will be found covered by the intermuscular fascia, the nerve beiug to the outer side. The needle should be passed from without inward after the veins have been separated from the artery. Ligation of the Posterior Tibial Artery at its Middle Third. —An incision two and a half inches in length should be made parallel with the inner edge of the tibia and half an inch from its border. The skin and the superficial and deep fascise should be divided, and the inner edge of the soleus muscle will be exposed ; displace this outward, and the artery with its veins will be exposed, also the posterior tibial nerve to the outer side. The needle should be passed from without inward after separating the veins. Ligation of the Posterior Tibial Artery behind the Inner Malleolus.—A curved incision two inches in length should be made mid- way between the tendo Achillis and the internal malleolus. (Fig. 301.) Fig. 301. Ligation of the posterior tibial artery at its lower third. (Agnew.) Having divided the skin and superficial fascia, the deep fascia should be lifted upon a director and freely opened, when the artery will be exposed, with the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum mus- cles on the inner side, and the posterior tibial nerve and tendon of the flexor longus pollicis muscle on the outer side. The veins should be sepa- rated from the artery, and the needle passed from without inward.

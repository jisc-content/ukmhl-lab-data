1037 RECTO-VESICAL FISTULA. dents of parturition and wounds received in operations upon the rectum, vagina, bladder, or urethra, Becto-urethral fistula occasionally results from the operation of lithotomy, or from rupture of the urethra following stricture. But the most frequent cause of these fistulse is malignant disease of the rectum, the growth involving one of the contiguous organs. Treatment.â€”In accidental wounds of contiguous organs made in opera- tions upon the rectum, the wounds should be promptly closed by sutures, and in the majority of cases rapid union occurs, so that no permanent fistula results. Where, however, a fistula persists, a plastic operation must be undertaken to close the fistula, except in cases resulting from cancer of the rectum, where no operation is likely to be of any service. A recto-vaginal fistula in the latter cases often is followed by the relief of pain and tenes- mus and abatement of the symptoms of obstruction. A recto vesical or recto-urethral fistula, on the other hand, may cause so much pain and dis- comfort that the patient's condition can be improved only by making an artificial anus in the iliac region.

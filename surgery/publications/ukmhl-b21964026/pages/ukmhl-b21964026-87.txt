69 CHAPTER V. REPAIR OP WOUNDS—REGENERATION OP TISSUES. The reparative powers of the tissues of the human body are considerable, although not comparable with those of the lower animals, in the lowest orders of which the reproduction of an entire limb or even one-half of the body regularly takes place. In order to understand the regeneration of tis- sue we must first consider briefly the life-history of the cells. A cell consists of a mass of protoplasm, generally enclosed in a cell membrane, and contain- ing a nucleus and a nucleolus. The nucleus represents the most vital part of the cell protoplasm, staining most intensely with the various dyes used in histological methods, and having a more granular appearance. The nucleolus is a minute solid spot in the nucleus, appearing to be much more highly refractive. Cell Division.—When the cell is quiescent the protoplasm appears evenly granular (Fig. 29, 1), but when it is stirred to active life, slender twining threads are to be traced in the nucleus, resembling the coils of the capillary vessels in the glomerulus of the kidney, and perhaps consisting merely of one long thread twisted upon itself. On account of their readi- ness to take up the dyes used in staining, the threads are called chromatine threads. When the cells are about to divide, the chromatine threads are seen to arrange themselves about the equator of the nucleus in a rosette or star shape, known as the mother-star. (Fig. 29, 2 to 4b. 4a is a polar and 4b an equatorial view of the same cell.) Some larger granules then appear at the ends of an axis passing perpendicularly through this equatorial rosette, at the poles of the nucleus, and the loops of the threads are directed towards the poles. Gradually these threads become arranged in radiating Fig. 29. 5 6 8 Karyoinitosis. (F. C. Wood, M.D.)

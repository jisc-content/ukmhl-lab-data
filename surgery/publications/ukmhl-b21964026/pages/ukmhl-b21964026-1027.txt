The anus is absent, and the rectum terminates in the vagina, usually at its lower portion. (Fig. 802.)

Where there has been failure in the development of the perineal septum, the anus is usually absent and the rectum terminates in some portion of the genito- urinary tract. 5. The anus is absent, and the rectum terminates in a narrow sinus, which opens beneath the prepuce. (Fig. 803.) In this variety Fig. 802. Fig. 803. Fig. 804.

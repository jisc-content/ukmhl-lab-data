566 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. process of the spine of the scapula, with the inner fibres of the coraco- brachialis muscle and the short and long head of the biceps, are put FlG- 487^ upon the stretch. The axillary vessels and nerves are often se- verely pressed upon. Causes.—Subcoracoid and sub- clavicular dislocations may arise Fig. 486. Subglenoid dislocation of the humerus. (After Agnew.)

They also result from blows or falls upon the outer surface of the shoulder. Fig. 488. Subcoracoid dislocation of the hume- rus. (After Agnew.) Deformity in a recent subcoracoid dislocation of the humerus. Subspinous Dislocation.—In this dislocation the head of the hume- rus rests on the dorsum of the scapula behind the glenoid cavity and im- mediately below the spine of the scapula. (Fig. 491.)

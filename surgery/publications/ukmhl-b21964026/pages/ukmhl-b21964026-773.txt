DISEASES OF THE NASAL SINUSES. 747 Ethmoidal Sinuses.—The ethmoidal sinuses, on account of their small size and more retired position, seem to be less liable to disease than the frontal. Myxomatous polypi grow in them, and empyema occurs, but necrosis of the bone is rare. When there is inflammation of these sinuses it is necessary to drain the cells, either by the nose, the turbinated bone being removed to give access to them, or by the orbit. The latter is the better method, for although any injury to the superior oblique muscle would result in strabismus, the pulley of the muscle is usually displaced by the swelling of the os planum, so that there is little danger of its being injured by per- foration of the bone at that point. The signs of disease of these cells are headache, nasal obstruction, and occasionally exophthalmos, diplopia, or "choked disk." Disease of the ethmoid may be suspected if these symp- toms are found combined with a disturbance of the orbit on both sides, disease of the frontal sinuses usually being unilateral. Sphenoidal Sinuses.—The diagnosis of diseases of the sphenoidal sinuses is practically impossible, for the symptoms are the same as those of the ethmoidal. The sphenoidal sinuses can be reached by means of a probe curved at the end and inserted in the nose to a depth of six and one- half centimetres from the nostril, the probe being made to follow the septum and then rotated for a quarter of a circle, when its extremity should enter the passage into the sinus. Its passage will relieve any retention.

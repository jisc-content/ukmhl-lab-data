SPINA BIFIDA. 892 INFLAMMATIONS AND TUMORS OF THE BACK. Cellulitis and carbuncle are found, but do not differ from the ordinary varieties of these affections. Syphilitic eruptions are also very frequent. Bursitis of the gluteal bursse occurs, and less frequently the bursa? about the scapula are inflamed. They present the usual symptoms, and are treated along the lines laid down elsewhere. Both benign and malignant tumors occur on the back, the most frequent being sebaceous cysts and lipomata. Sarcoma is found in the deep muscles of the back, and epithelioma occurs, although very rarely, in the skin. SPINA BIFIDA. Spina bifida (Fig. 756) is a congenital tumor, originating from the spinal canal, just as the meningoceles form on the head. Owing to improper de- velopment of the spinal column, its canal is not closed posteriorly, and pro- trusion of the membranes, and even of some of the nervous structures, takes place through the opening in the bones, from the pressure of the cerebro- spinal fluid. This protrusion may be situated in any part of the spine, but is most common in the lumbar and sacral regions. The skin covering the sac may be normal, but it is usually thin and translucent, and may be very vascular. In some cases the sac consists only of the membranes of the cord. The communication with the spinal canal may be very narrow or may in- volve many vertebral arches. Nerves are frequently seen running in the Fig. 756. Spina bifida.

The substance of the spinal cord is occasionally expanded over the walls of the sac. The cord and nerves are involved in two-thirds of the cases, and paralysis is a fre-

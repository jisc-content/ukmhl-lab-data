Extension restores the limb to its proper length, but upon the removal of the extending force the shortening reappears. Dislocation of the Hip Backward (Ischiatic).—In this dislo- cation, which Bigelow describes as dorsal below the tendon of the obturator internus muscle, the head of the bone is dislo- cated into the sacro-sciatic notch. (Fig. 517.) This dislocation results from force applied to the knee, foot, or pelvis when the thigh is flexed upon the pelvis. Symptoms.—In this dislocation the limb is slightly flexed, inverted, and adducted, and the knee is turned towards its fellow and touches the thigh at the inner margin of the patella. (Fig. 518.) The shortening is rarely more than half an inch ; the hip is less prominent, and the trochanter is farther from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, than in the dorsal dislocation. The bone is less mo- ischiatic dislocation of the head of the vable and its head is lower than in the iliac femur. variety. Treatment.—Reduction of iliac and ischiatic dislocations may be ac- complished by manipulation or by extension and counter-extension. In

30 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. virulence the entire focus may be excised like a tumor, the knife being kept outside of the diseased tissue on all sides, or the infected part may be completely destroyed by the cautery. After-Treatment.â€”Some surgeons irrigate every suppurating cavity as soou as opened; others prefer to let nature clean the cavity, fearing that irrigation may wash out clots and result in serious hemorrhage, and pack the cavity with iodoform gauze or sterilized gauze for the first twenty-four hours. At the second dressing the cavity may be irrigated with simple sterilized water or with boric acid solution, or with antiseptic solutions, such as 1 to 5000 bichloride of mercury or 1 to 50 carbolic acid. If the cavity is not laid widely open and packed, a tube or a tent of gauze is to be kept in place until it has fully contracted. The dressing is to be changed as often as it is soaked through with the discharge, or whenever pain and fever indicate any retention of discharge in the cavity. Although it is pos- sible to obtain good results by dressing abscesses with simple sterilized gauze, we prefer some mild antiseptic (1 to 3000 or 5000 bichloride of mercury solution) in the gauze, because of the tendency to decomposition of the pus.

661 TREATMENT OF LATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE. often complains of pain in the dorsal or the lumbar region, or of weakness of the back. If the patient is stripped of clothing and made to stand before the surgeon, if the curvature is in the dorsal region the lower angle of one or other of the scapulae or the iliac crests is unduly prominent. If the tips of the spinous processes are marked with chalk or a pencil, the line of curva- ture can be distinctly demonstrated (Fig. 595) ; the shoulder upon the affected side is unduly elevated, and the breast on one side may be more prominent than its fellow. The limbs may also present asymmetry, shown Fig. 595. Fig. 596. Lateral curvature of the spine. (Sayre.) Lateral curvature of the spine associated with rachitic deformities. by obliquity of the pelvis when the patient stands. In lumbar curvature, if the patient bends forward, with the arms hanging loosely, the erector spinas muscles become more prominent on the convexity of the curve. In dorsal curvature the angles of the ribs on the side of convexity are on a higher level than on the side of concavity. (Fig. 596.) Lateral curvature is likely to be confounded only with hysterical curva- ture of the spine, which entirely disappears if the patient is made to stoop forward until the fingers touch the floor, and with tuberculosis of the lateral aspects of the bodies of the vertebrae, which may cause lateral curvature of the spine ; but the latter condition is associated with rigidity of the spine and other symptoms of Pott's disease, so that it is not difficult to recognize the true nature of the affection. Treatment.â€”In the treatment of lateral curvature of the spine sys- tematic exercise of the muscles of the trunk holds the first place as a cura- tive measure. In addition to regulated gymnastic exercise, intervals of rest

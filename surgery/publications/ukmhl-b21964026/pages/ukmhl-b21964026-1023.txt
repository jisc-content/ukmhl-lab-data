997 OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED HERNIA. as to the vitality of the gut, for it protects the bowel from injury during attempts at taxis, and by its pressure probably decreases venous conges- tion, thus diminishing the risk of gangrene. If omentum is found in the sac, it should be resected, a ligature being placed around its narrow neck ; but it should be carefully examined in order to avoid injury to any small loop of bowel which may be enclosed in it. If the intestine is dark purple or of a whitish-gray color, it must be considered suspicious, and especial care must be taken in examining the narrow part of the bowel lying directly under the constriction. There is no certain sign of viability, for dark- colored gut has recovered, and gut which bled freely has sloughed after reduction. Free separation of the peritoneal coat indicates sloughing. In doubtful cases the intestine may be left lying in the wound lightly covered with gauze for from six to twenty-four hours, until the surgeon is certain of its viability. If it is evident that the intestine cannot live, it is gen- erally best to make an artificial anus by attaching the intestine loosely to the edges of the ring with peritoneal stitches, so as to shut off the peritoneal cavity, and incising the most dependent part of the loop, which should be left in place until adhesions have formed, when it can be cut away. If the patient's condition is good, however, and the surgeon is trained in intestinal surgery, the affected loop of bowel may be resected and the ends united at once by sutures or by Murphy's button, the latter being the more rapid method. But even with the greatest skill there is danger of infection of the peritoneum by the sloughing bowel. For the details of the resection we refer to the chapter on intestinal surgery.

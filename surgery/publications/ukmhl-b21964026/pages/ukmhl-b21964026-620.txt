DISLOCATIONS OF THE ANKLE. 594 Fig. 534. In this dislocation, as well as in the forward variety, fracture of the external or internal malleolus may be associated with the injury. Symptoms.— The symptoms are shortening of the foot and lengthening and elevation of the heel; the tendo Achillis stands out prominently upon the posterior portion of the leg. Treatment.—Eeduction is accomplished by flexing the leg upon the thigh and making extension and counter-extension from the foot and leg; at the same time the surgeon forces the bones of the leg back- ward and draws the foot forward. In cases in which much difficulty is experienced, subcutaneous division of the tendo Achillis greatly facilitates the reduction and over- comes the subsequent tendency to displace- ment. The after-treatment is similar to that employed in forward displacement. Outward Dislocation of the Ankle.—This dislocation is produced by force which drives the foot into a state of extreme abduction, and is usually associated with rupture of the internal lateral ligament and fracture of the external malleolus. (Fig. 535.) The symptoms are marked eversion of the foot, prominence of the internal malleolus, and a depression over the lower portion of the fibula, which marks the site of the fracture of Backward dislocation of the ankle.

Treatment.—Reduction is accomplished by making extension and counter-extension and at the same time bringing the foot into a position of adduction. After reduction lateral moulded binders' board splints should be fitted to the leg, with one compress applied between the external splint

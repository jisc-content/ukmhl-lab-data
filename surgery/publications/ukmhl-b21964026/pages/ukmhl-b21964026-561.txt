535 TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS OF THE SPINE. first turns of the bandage should be passed around the pelvis just above the trochanters, and the turns should then be carried spirally up the chest to the axillary folds. A number of layers of bandage should be applied to make a dressing of sufficient firmness, four or five bandages usually being required for a child, a larger number for an adult. In a few minutes after the bandage has set the patient is lifted carefully and laid upon his back on a bed, and is not allowed to move until the bandage has become quite firm. The patient is then allowed to get up and move about. This dressing, if comfortable, need not be removed for six weeks or two months, at which time a new band- age should be applied in the same manner. In cases of cervical or high dorsal disease a jury-mast (Fig. 457) is attached to the bandage, to remove the weight of the superincumbent parts from the diseased vertebrae ; two metal strips attached to a plate are incorporated in the plaster bandage to secure the jury-mast. A leather jacket made of raw hide may be moulded over a plaster cast taken from a plaster jacket (Fig. 458) ; this is cut in front and laced so that it can be removed at times for the purpose of bathing the patient, or can be removed at night. The jury-mast may also be attached to the leather jacket. A properly fitted metal brace, such as Taylor's, may be used to furnish fixation in cases where the patient is under careful supervision, but unless carefully applied and watched it is useless to apply this apparatus. (Fig. 459.) We have found among the poorer class of patients that the parents do not appreciate the importance of watching the case, and are apt to re- move the brace and allow the child to go for days without it, interfering very materially with a satisfactory result.

FRACTURE OF THE SHAFT OF THE HUMERUS. 455 The direction of fracture is generally oblique. In children, transverse and incomplete fractures may occur. Causes.—This fracture usually results from direct violence, but numer- ous cases are recorded in which it was due to muscular action. Spiral fractures of the humerus occasionally occur, involving a large extent of the shaft, and are produced by forcible twisting of the bone. Symptoms.—The most marked signs of this fracture are deformity, mobility, and crepitus. In fractures below the insertion of the deltoid, the upper fragment may be little changed in Dressing for fractures of the upper Fracture in the lower third of the portion of the humerus. humerus. (Agnew.) may be drawn upward and inward by the biceps and triceps muscles. In oblique fractures in the lower third of the bone, the lower fragment is likely to slip behind the upper one, and in this case the shortening is very marked, by reason of the contraction of the biceps and triceps muscles. (Fig. 362.) Prognosis.—In simple fractures results are usually satisfactory; un- united fractures of the humerus, however, are not uncommon. In these cases the failure of union probably results from the interposition of muscu- lar tissue or fascia between the ends of the bone or from imperfect immobili- zation of the fragments. Fractures of the shaft of the humerus are also sometimes complicated by paralysis from injury of the nerves of the arm at the time of the accident or from involvement of the nerves in the callus thrown out in the repair of the fracture. Gangrene has followed fracture of the shaft of the humerus from pressure of the fragment upon the brachial artery and vein. In many cases a certain amount of deformity or over- lapping of the bones results in spite of the most careful treatment, but this does not in any way affect the subsequent strength and usefulness of the arm.

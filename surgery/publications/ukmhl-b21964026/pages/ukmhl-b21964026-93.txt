UNION OF BONE AFTER FRACTURE. 75 exudation ; then the cells of the deeper layers of the periosteum and of the adjacent bone proliferate and form fusiform, stellate, or angular cells, the bone-cells being concerned especially in the internal callus. (Fig. 36.) These cells acquire a halo like cartilage-cells, and the substance in which they lie becomes solid, and is known as the osteoid substance. Near the centre of the callus true hyaline cartilage is produced. These cells are called osteoblasts. Lime salts are deposited in the osteoid substance and Fig. 37. Callus from fracture of a small bone, two weeks old: a, fibrous capsule of the callus ; b, trabecule of osteoid tissue formed from the periosteum and in the granulation-tissue of the callus; c, the shaft of the bone containing the fatty bone-marrow ; d, new-formed cartilage: e, a small fragment of bone which has been pushed into the marrow ; /, intermediary callus formed from the periosteum and also from the bone- marrow. cartilage, trabecular appear, and the osteoblasts form bone-cells. Haver- sian canals containing blood-vessels appear, running in different direc- tions from those of the subjacent normal bone. The internal callus thus forms a bridge of bone uniting the ends. The external callus has mean- while undergone similar changes, and both are altered into spongy bone, the spaces of which are filled by granulation-tissue, with a layer of osteo- blasts between it and the bone, which constantly add new bone to the

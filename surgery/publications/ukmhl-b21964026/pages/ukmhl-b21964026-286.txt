264 INSTRUMENTS FOR AMPUTATION. is frequently employed. For amputations about the hands and feet a narrow-bladed metacarpal saw will often be found useful. Fig. 184. Amputating saw. Bone Forceps.—Bone forceps may be used for dividing the phalanges in amputations, or for smoothing off any rough edges of the bone which have been left by the saw. (Fig. 185.) Fig. 185. Bone forceps. Periosteotome.—A periosteotome is sometimes employed before the bone has been divided, to loosen and turn up a cuff of periosteum, which, after the bone has been divided, is drawn down and secured over the sawn surface of the bone. (Fig. 186.) Fig. 186. Periosteotome. Artery or Haemostatic Forceps.—Artery or haemostatic forceps are also required. These instruments should be self-retaining, so that if the bleeding is profuse from small vessels after the tourniquet is removed, a number of vessels may be damped rapidly and the forceps allowed to remain in place, and, finally, when all bleeding has been arrested, the arteries can be twisted or ligatured before the forceps are removed. Retractors.—These consist of pieces of muslin from six to eight inches in width and twenty-four inches in length, one end of which is split into two or three tails. The former variety of retractor is employed where one bone is divided, as in amputations of the arm and thigh ; the latter in cases where two bones are divided, as in amputations of the forearm and leg. Ligatures.—Sterilized catgut or silk ligatures are usually employed to secure the vessels after amputation. Sutures and Needles.—A great many different materials are em- ployed for sutures in bringing together the flaps in amputations. Silk-

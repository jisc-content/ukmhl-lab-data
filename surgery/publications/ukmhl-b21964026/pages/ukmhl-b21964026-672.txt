EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 646 Excision of the Knee-Joint.—Excision of the knee-joint may be re- quired for injury, for ankylosis in faulty position, or for disease, and the operation is most frequently resorted to in cases of tuberculous arthritis of this joint. Operation.—The knee-joint is excised by making an incision which begins on the inner side of the limb, at the inner condyle of the femur, and Fig. 574. Result of anterior excision of the hip-joint. The same ease showing the extent of flexion of the thigh. is carried over the front of the knee, just below the patella, to a correspond- ing point upon the external condyle of the femur (Fig. 575) ; the flap thus formed, consisting of skin and connective tissue, is dissected up to a point corresponding with the upper edge of the patella. The ligamentum patellar is then cut through transversely, the leg is slightly flexed, and the joint is opened ; the lateral ligaments are next divided, and by flexing the leg upon the thigh the joint-surfaces are freely exposed. The semilunar cartilages are next removed, the condyles of the femur are freed posteriorly with a blunt-pointed bistoury, a narrow-bladed saw is placed under the condyles, and a transverse section of the bone is removed. (Fig. 576.) The head of the tibia is next cleared in the same manner, and a transverse section of this bone is removed with a saw. The patella may be removed before excising the ends of the bones, or, if ankylosed to the condyles, it may be removed with the section of bone which includes a portion of the condyles. After a sufficient amount of bone has been removed, if localized areas of carious bone present themselves upon the sawn surface of either bone, they

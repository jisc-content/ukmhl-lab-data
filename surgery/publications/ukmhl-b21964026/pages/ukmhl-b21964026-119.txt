MYOMA. 99 less apt to become malignant than single ones. . Cartilaginous tissue often forms a part of other tumors, and especially of the so-called mixed tumors. The diagnosis between chondroma and osteoma will often be impossible in the epiphyseal tumors, but examination with a needle will enable one to recognize the former, as its point will penetrate it. Treatment.â€”The majority of these tumors require no treatment, but if any operation is attempted they should be thoroughly eradicated. The pedunculated variety is easily removed, and will not return if the base be Fig. 57. Enehondroina of hand. Chondroma of foot. thoroughly gouged out. Those with broad bases, sometimes encircling a bone or originating from its centre, can be removed only by amputation. Rapid growth and softening indicate malignant change and the necessity for radical operations. The chondromata which arise independently of the normal cartilages, in the parotid, for instance, grow slowly, but are especially liable to malignant change, and should be removed unless there is great danger of injury to the facial nerve. If they show any tendency to rapid growth a very complete extirpation must be made for the same reason, not merely shelling the tumor out of its capsule. Chondroma of the upper jaw is especially liable to recurrence and final malignant changes, and there- fore that bone should be sacrificed at the first operation. MYOMA. A myoma is a tumor composed of muscular tissue. A tumor formed of unstriped or involuntary muscle is called a leiomyoma, and one of striped muscle a rhabdomyoma. The former is seldom found pure, being almost invariably associated with fibrous tissue, the muscular and fibrous cells being often so much alike that it is difficult to distinguish them. (Fig. 59.)

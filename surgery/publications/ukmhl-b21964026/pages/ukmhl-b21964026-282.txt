260 AFTER-EFFECTS OF ANAESTHESIA. develop until some time, often two or three weeks, after their employment, H. C. Wood is of the opinion that the relation between the mental symp- toms and the anaesthesia has not been clearly proved in these cases, and that it is rather the outcome of a peculiar depression of the cerebral cortex pro- duced by the shock of the operation itself, or by the emotional strain due to the surgical illness. This view seems to be confirmed by the fact that many of the cases of emotional insanity which are observed follow injuries in which no anaesthetic has been given. Albuminuria and glycosuria may follow the administration of ether or chloroform, but are usually only temporary conditions.

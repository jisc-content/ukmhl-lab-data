AMPUTATIONS AT THE SHOULDER-JOINT. 286 strap, the ends of which are crossed high up upon the shoulder and passed to the opposite axilla, may be used. Oval, or Larrey's Method.â€”In this method of amputation, which is that most generally employed, the arm should be held a short distance from the body ; the point of the knife is entered just below the acromion process, and a deep incision three Fig. 217. inches in length is made down to the head of the bone along the axis of the arm ; from the middle of this incision two others Incisions for Larrey's amputation at the shoulder-jont. are made, one on each side, oblicpiely downward to the point where the an- terior and posterior folds of the axilla end in the tis- sues of the arm (Fig. 217) ; the latter incisions should be only deep enough to divide the skin and superficial fascia. The flaps are then dissected up until the head of the bone is well exposed, and after opening the capsule and dividing the muscles inserted into the neck and the tuberosity of the humerus, which may be facilitated by rotating the head of the bone out- ward and inward, the disarticulation is effected by adducting the elbow and passing the knife downward behind the bone and cutting outward in the line of the cutaneous incisions.

In securing the dressing to the wounds after amputations at the shoulder- joint, a few recurrent and circular turns of a bandage are applied, and the turns of the bandage are carried over the stump and to the opposite axilla, a number of these turns being employed, and the bandage is finished with a few circular turns.

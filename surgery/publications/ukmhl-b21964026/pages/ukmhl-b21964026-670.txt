EXCISION OF THE HIP-JOINT. 644 sule of the joint is opened. An assistant should next rotate the thigh inward and outward, and with a blunt-pointed knife the muscles attached to the trochanters are shaved off close to the bone ; the head and neck of the femur are then freed by the use of a knife and the elevator ; the thigh is adducted and pushed upward, and the head and neck of the bone are made to project from the wound. (Fig. 571.) A transverse section of the bone is then made with a saw or chain saw, just below the great trochan- ter. In some cases it is difficult to remove the head of the bone, which may be more or less firmly ankylosed to the acetabulum ; here the neck of the bone should be divided with a chain saw passed around the femur just below the tro- chanter, or it may be divided with a narrow metacarpal saw from without inward, or with a chisel, the head and neck of the bone being after- wards removed with the gouge or bone-cutting pliers. After the head and neck of the bone have been removed, the acetabulum should be carefully examined, and if it be found carious the diseased bone should be removed with a curette or gouge, or with gouge forceps. If the acetabulum has been perforated and an abscess exists within the pelvis, the bony floor of the acetabulum should be cut away with a gouge, a curette being employed to clear out as far as possible the abscess-cavity, and a Fig. 572.

The edges of the incision should next be brought together by sutures, and a gauze dressing applied. The result of an excision of the hip-joint by this method is shown in Fig. 572.

686 AVULSION OF THE SCALP. surrounding skin should be washed with soap and water, then with turpen- tine or alcohol, and finally with the bichloride solution. If asepsis be se- cured, primary union can be obtained in wounds of the scalp as well as in other tissues, but if the edges are much contused and the scalp has been detached from the head, so as to leave ragged flaps, it is wiser not to insert many sutures, but to employ drainage. Any exposed bone should be covered, if possible, in order to avoid necrosis. Wounds in this region need very careful watching after suture, in order to prevent any retention of secretions, on account of the difficulty of providing for their natural es- cape. Burns and scalds of the scalp do not differ from those in other regions except in the loss of the hair. Avulsion.â€”A characteristic injury of the scalp is its avulsion. In persons with long hair the latter may be caught in revolving machinery, and the entire scalp, or a large portion of it, may be torn directly from the head, leaving the pericranium exposed.

(Sick.) is very great, and the loss of blood may be considerable, so that death has occurred from these causes alone. Great care is necessary during recovery in order to preserve the patient's strength, on account of the constant loss of serum from so large a granulating surface, and deaths from exhaustion are not uncommon. These large wounds granulate, and are covered partly by contraction and partly by the epidermis growing from the edges. (Fig. 631.) Skin-grafting is usually necessary, and has cured many cases, the best method being that of Thiersch.

When the inguinal ring closes in the normal manner, but a hernia de- velops afterwards, it is termed an acquired hernia. (Fig. 792.) The ac- quired varieties of inguinal hernia are two : first, the oblique, which descends through the inguinal canal, entering at the internal ring and passing out at the external; and, secondly, the direct, in which the hernia enters a pouch of peritoneum, which is apt to form in the centre of the conjoined tendon just internal to the epigastric artery, pushes the conjoined tendon before it, and makes its way out at the external ring. A direct hernia may penetrate

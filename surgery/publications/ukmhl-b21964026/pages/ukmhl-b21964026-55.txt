TREATMENT OF ULCERS. 39 dressing of gauze, with a very thick layer of sterilized cotton and a firm starched bandage outside. This dressing can be left in place for a week. In some cases there is a tendency for the granulations to rise above the level of the skin, and then firm strapping of the leg with strips of adhesive plas- ter is required. The strapping also draws together the edges of the ulcer and thus assists it to heal. If there is much discharge a dressing must be applied over the strapping. Local Applications.â€”In other cases it is necessary to stimulate the granulations by very light applications of nitrate of silver (gr. v to x in 3j), balsam of Peru, alnin, permanganate of potash (gr. v to x in nitrate of mercury, sulphate of copper or zinc (same strength), or powdered quinine, Fig. 19. Syphilitic ulcer of leg. The same, healed. salicylic acid, or antipyrine, or a ten to twenty-five per cent, ointment of ichthyol. Ointments of oxide of zinc or boric acid are merely protectives, and suited to cases in which the granulations are fairly healthy. For small ulcers of the same character, powdered subnitrate of bismuth or calomel is useful, forming a protective scab with the secretions. For sloughing ulcers, especially of syphilitic origin, iodoform applied abundantly as a powder is unexcelled; but in some cases it excites a dermatitis, so the surrounding- skin should be protected with some simple ointment. Iodoform is excel- lent, too, in the treatment of tuberculous ulcers, and balsam of Peru is also somewhat of a specific in these cases. (Figs. 19, 20.) In order to obtain a cure in chronic ulcers it is necessary to cause absorp- tion of the indurated tissues of the base and edges. Moist warm dressings, massage (through a couple of layers of gauze), and incisions are the best methods of treatment. Poultices are unnecessary and unclean, and a heavy

172 CHAPTER IX. MINOR SURGERY. BANDAGING. Bandages are usually prepared from strips of muslin, flannel, crinoline, or cheese-cloth, which are rolled into the form of a cylinder, and are em- ployed to hold dressings in contact with the surface of the body, to make pressure, or to retain splints in place in the treatment of fractures or dislo- cations. The ordinary roller bandage consists of a strip of woven material, usually unbleached muslin, but cheese-cloth may also be employed, which varies in length from one to nine yards and in width from one inch to four inches ; this, for convenience of application, is rolled into a cylindrical form. In preparing the roller bandages it is important that they should be free from seams and selvage, for if made of a number of pieces sewed together, or if they contain selvage, they cannot be so neatly applied and are apt to leave creases upon the skin of the patient. In preparing the ordinary roller band- age, muslin or cheese-cloth is torn into strips, and is then rolled into a cylin- der, either by the hand or by a machine constructed for the purpose. To roll a bandage by hand, the Fig. 96. strip should be folded at one extremity several times until a small cylinder is formed ; this is then grasped by the extrem- ities between the thumb and finger of the left hand ; the free extremity of the strip is then grasped by the thumb and index finger of the right hand, and by alternating pronation and supination of the right hand the cylinder is revolved and the roller is formed.

Bandage one inch wide, three yards in length, for bandages for the hand, fingers, and toes. Bandage two inches wide, six yards in length, for head bandages and for the extremities in children. Bandage two and a half inches wide, seven yards in length, for bandages

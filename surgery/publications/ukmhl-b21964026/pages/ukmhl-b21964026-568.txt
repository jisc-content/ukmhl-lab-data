ATROPHY OF BONE. 542 were hypertrophied. In very muscular subjects the bones subjected to ex- cessive use may show increase in length and thickness, as well as hypertro- phy of the ridges for muscular attachments. In parallel bones, when one boue is partially destroyed by disease, hypertrophy of the other bone is often observed. The hypertrophy which is often seen in the skull and in other bones is generally due to chronic osteomyelitis and osteosclerosis. (Fig. 465.) The term osteoporosis is also applied to this affection, and the best examples of this disease are observed in the skull. (Fig. 466.) No special treatment is indicated for this condition. Atrophy Of Bone.â€”This condition is much more common than hyper- trophy of bone, being shown by diminished solidity, thickness, and length, and usually residts from defective nutrition. The bone be- comes more porous, the medulla and cancellous tissue are increased in size and filled with fat, and the cortical por- tion is so wasted that it represents but a fraction of its normal thickness. (Fig. 467.) Atrophy of bone may result from many causes, and may occur at any period of life, but is most common in advanced age. It may result as a temporary condition after fracture, when a bone has had its function suspended Fig. 465. Fig. 467 Km I Fig. 466. ifiB Osteosclerosis of the femur. (Agnew.) Osteoporosis of the skull. (Agnew Atrophy of the fernur. for a long time, or may be observed in old age, when diminished function and defective nutrition both conduce to atrophy elsewhere as well as in the bone. The best examples of atrophy of bone are seen in cases of infantile paralysis, when the bones of one or both limbs remain wasted, while other bones in the body attain their normal proportions. Malignant disease is said to produce atrophy of the bone. In this disease the bones often become weaker, so that they are liable to fracture, but we know of no observations which prove that there results actual atrophy of the bones.

TUMORS OF THE VAGINA AND VULVA. 1183 Fig. 900. situated in the substance of the labium majus near its posterior border, and even when large retain more or less of its shape. They are generally caused by infection of the ducts, especially by gonorrhoea, and the duct is not always completely obstructed, so that under strong pressure part of the contents of the sac may be evacuated. These cysts cause slight symptoms unless they are large or unless they suppu- rate (Fig. 902), when there is great pain and swelling, motion of the thigh becoming painful and adduc- tion impossible, while micturition may be impeded by the oedema. The treatment of these cysts is incision of the mucous membrane covering them, and their complete enucleation. When suppuration has occurred, forming a vuTvo-vaginal abscess, the same method should be adopted if possible ; but if the parts are too adherent to the capsule, the cavity should be thoroughly laid open, as much of the capsule as pos- sible enucleated, and the wound packed with gauze and compelled to heal from the bottom. The small mucous cysts seldom require treatment other than incision and the application of strong carbolic acid or some other mild caustic to the interior of the sac. Papillomata of the vulva (Fig. 903) are originally soft, moist growths, covered with a cheesy discharge, but when exposed to the air they become hard. They are usually multiple, and result from venereal infection in the Fibrolipoma of labium majus. (Case of Dr. J. B. Deaver.) Fig. 901. Fig. 902. Mucous cyst of labium. (Agnew.)

Thorough cleansing of the parts, with the application of a dry dusting powder, such as calomel, will often effect a

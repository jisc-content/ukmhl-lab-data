iv PREFACE. the Breast, the Abdomen, the Urinary Organs, and the Male and Female Genitals, etc., were written by the junior author. The chapter on the Injuries and Diseases of the Eye was prepared by Professor George E. de Schweinitz, whose masterly treatment of the subject cannot fail to commend it to the judicious reader. The majority of the illustrations used are original and were made from photographs or drawings. When illustrations have been taken from other sources, the authors have, where it was possible, credited the source from which they were taken. The authors desire to express their thanks to Dr. Timothy Matlack Chees- man, Chief of the Department of Bacteriology in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, for valuable assistance in the preparation of some of the illustrations of bacteria, and to Dr. Francis Carter Wood, late House Surgeon to St. Luke's Hospital, of New York, for drawings of bacteriological and histological subjects. They also desire to express their thanks to Dr. J. H. Jopson, of Philadelphia, for careful re- vision of the proof-sheets, to Mr. James Wood for excellent photographic work used in illustrating many of the subjects, and to Mr. Joseph McCreery for his careful and critical proof-reading.

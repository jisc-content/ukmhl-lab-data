121 TUBULAR CARCINOMA. and it is usually rather more malignant. Epithelioma of the tongue grows rapidly, and has a strong tendency to spread beyond that organ, but in all other situations epithelioma grows slowly, invades the lymphatic glands late, and seldom produces metastases, the duration of life, even without opera- tion, often being several years. In one particular variety of epithelioma known as rodent ulcer, or Jacob's ulcer, the disease progresses very slowly, lasting for ten, fifteen, or twenty years, during which time its growth may be arrested at one edge. Attempts at cicatrization are also seen. It is often difficult to prove the epitheliornatous nature of this disease, although epithelial pearls can generally be found by a sufficiently thorough search, Fig. 82. I. Epithelioma of the hand : a, slough covering ulcerating area ; b, epithelial pearl, more highly magnified in II.; c, round-cell infiltration of subcutaneous tissue ; d, normal skin. X 100. (F. C. Wood, M.D.) and the characteristic penetration of the basement membrane by the cells is usually well marked. Tubular Carcinoma.â€”Carcinoma growing from those mucous mem- branes which have not pavement epithelium contains cylindrical cells ar- ranged like the tubular glands Tubular carcinoma occurs in the stomach and intestines, being most frequent at points of narrowing like the pylorus and the ileo-caecal valve, and also in the sigmoid flexure and the rectum. Three-quarters of the cases of cancer of the bowel occur in the rectum, and only about two per cent, of them in the small intestine. Tubular carcinoma is common in the uterus, beginning in the mucous membrane. Cancer of the kidney is always tubular, but this form is rare in the testi- cle, where the disease is usually encephaloid of the acinous type. Tubu-

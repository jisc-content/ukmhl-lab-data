INTUBATION IN CICATRICIAL STENOSIS. 873 Intubation in Cicatricial Stenosis of the Larynx.â€”The introduc- tion of an intubation-tube in cases of stenosis of the larynx resulting from cicatrization following wounds or injuries, or following the pressure of growths upon the larynx, or in cases where there is difficulty in the removal of the tracheotomy-tube, may often be employed with advantage. When intubation-tubes are introduced for stenosis of the larynx, they are em- ployed not only to relieve the dyspnoea, but also as dilators, and, therefore, the tubes should be removed at intervals and replaced by larger ones. In such cases the larynx seems to bear the presence of the tube remarkably well, and it may be allowed to remain for a week or ten days without re- moval. It should be removed, however, at this time, and replaced by a tube of greater size if there is evidence that its further use is required.

As the bone increases in amount the hyaline cartilage disappears, some believing that it changes by calcification and the alteration of its cells into bone- cells. This large amount of callus is called the provisional callus; when union is complete it grows smaller, and the remaining portion, known as the definitive callus, becomes denser. Associated with the ab- sorption of the callus is the pres- ence of large cells with many nuclei (so-called giant-cells or osteoclasts), which lie in little excavations along the edges of the trabeculae of bone, making it appear as if they caused the absorption of the bone, although (Fig. 38.)

(Paget.) means the medullary canal is formed through the centre of the callus (Fig. 40), and the cortical portion of the included broken ends is absorbed, so that it may finally become impossible to locate the point of injury.

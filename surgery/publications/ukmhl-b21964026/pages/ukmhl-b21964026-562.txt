536 TREATMENT OF SPINAL ABSCESS. The length of time a fixation apparatus should be worn in tuberculosis of the spine is often a difficult matter to decide. It is wiser to continue the support for a longer time than seems absolutely necessary than to run the risk of removing it too soon. As a rule, support in cases which run a favorable course should be employed for at least a year or eighteen Fig. 458. Fig. 459. Jury-mast. Leather splint with jury-mast. Spinal brace. months. Some cases require this treatment for a longer time. If the plaster of Paris jacket has been used and the case is doing well, after a year or eighteen months a leather jacket or a metal brace can be substituted for the plaster, which should be worn for a time, and can finally be dispensed with when there is ample evidence that the disease has been arrested. Treatment of Spinal Abscess.â€”As before stated, abscess occurs in a large number of cases of tuberculosis of the spine, and its occurrence often prevents the wearing of suitable apparatus. A small abscess may not re- quire operative treatment, and, if good protection is afforded by the appa- ratus, may undergo absorption. If, however, the abscess increases in size, the contents may be removed by aspiration or incision. Eepeated aspiration, with great care as regards asepsis, is, on the whole, to be preferred to free incision. In aspirating a spinal abscess the skin overlying the abscess should be sterilized, as well as the aspirating needle ; the needle is introduced into the cavity of the abscess, and the fluid is allowed to escape. Difficulty in completely emptying tuberculous abscesses is often experienced through the canula's becoming clogged with masses of broken-down cellular tissue. These may be removed by introducing the plunger into the canula and freeing its canal. After the fluid has been removed the puncture should be closed with a piece of gauze painted over with iodoform collodion. Aspira-

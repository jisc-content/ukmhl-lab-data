375 TIBIAL AND PLANTAE ANEURISMS knee-joint, and may perforate the posterior ligament, rapturing into the joint itself. It may extend upward into Hunter's canal or downward into the calf. Rupture may also take place subeutaneously or externally. Treatment.—Compression is still a favorite mode of treatment, and is applied digitally or instrumentally to the common or superficial femoral. Ligation is often successful, and the superficial femoral at the apex of Scarpa's triangle is the point at which to occlude the vessel, although it may also be practised in Hunter's canal, or even in the upper portion of the popliteal space. Eeid's method and flexion probably yield their best results in this situation, and, although uncertain, are not dangerous. Finally, excision has been practised a number of times and very successfully. Bolton gives a mortality of five and two-tenths per cent, from this operation. Tibial and Plantar Aneurisms.—Aneurisms of the tibial arteries are generally traumatic iu origin. In the posterior tibial they may be treated in accordance with the directions already given for popliteal aneurism ; in the anterior tibial, compression, ligation, or excision, and in the foot, ex- cision, would be advisable. Aneurisms of the plantar arteries are usually traumatic in origin and arise from punctured or gunshot wounds, but may also arise spontaneously. Kinloch has collected twenty-two cases of spon- taneous aneurism of the posterior tibial artery. The treatment of spontane- ous aneurism of the tibial arteries consists in the use of distal compression of the femoral artery, and if this fails to produce a cure the aneurism should be exposed by incision and opened, and, after the application of ligatures to the vessels upon either side of the sac, this should be excised. Aneurism of the dorsalis pedis or plantar artery should be treated by ligature of the vessel upon each side, and excision of the sac.

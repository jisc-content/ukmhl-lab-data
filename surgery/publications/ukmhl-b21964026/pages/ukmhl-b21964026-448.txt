BUNION. 422 Bunion.—This is a bursal enlargement over the metatarso phalangeal articulation of the great toe which is very frequently observed, hallux val- gus being the almost universal cause. The part is swollen and tender upon pressure, and if suppuration occurs the pain is severe, and cellulitis is apt to develop, involving the surrounding parts, or the joint may be involved, caries of the bones of the articulation resulting. Treatment.—If suppuration has not occurred, the part should be pro- tected from pressure by a circular shield of felt or plaster ; if suppuration has taken place, the part should be incised and drained, and if the joint is found diseased it should be curetted and dressed with an antiseptic dress- ing ; if malposition of the toe exists, its position should be corrected by excision of the joint or by an osteotomy of the metatarsal bone of the toe a little distance above the joint.

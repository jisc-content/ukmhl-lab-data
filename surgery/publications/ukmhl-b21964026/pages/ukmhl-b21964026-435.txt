THE GREAT SCIATIC NERVE. 409 The Ulnar Nerve.—The ulnar nerve may be exposed in the middle of the arm, just above the elbow, or in the forearm. In the middle of the arm it may be exposed by an incision similar to that for exposure of the median nerve, and is to be sought for to the inner side of this nerve. It is exposed with the greatest ease behind the elbow, where it can be felt in a groove between the inner condyle and the olecranon process. In the lower part of the forearm it may be exposed by an incision along the radial border of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. The Radial Nerve.—This nerve may be exposed by an incision similar to that employed in ligation of the radial artery in the forearm down to a point about three inches above the wrist, where it passes under the tendon of the supinator longus muscle to the back of the hand. The Great Sciatic Nerve.—This nerve is exposed by an incision three or four inches in length, beginning just below the gluteo-femoral crease on a line from the middle of the popliteal space to a point a little to the inner side of the middle of a line drawn from the great trochanter to the tuber ischii. After dividing the skin and fascia the gluteus maximus muscle should be drawn outward and upward, and the biceps muscle drawn inward, when the nerve will be brought into view. The Internal Popliteal Nerve.—This nerve lies under the deep fascia in the middle of the popliteal space, and may be exposed by a longitudinal incision in this position. The External Popliteal Nerve.—This nerve is exposed by an incision two inches in length on the inner side of the tendon of the biceps, a short distance above its insertion into the head of the fibula. The Anterior and Posterior Tibial Nerves.—These nerves may be exposed at any point- in the leg by incisions similar to those employed in ligation of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.

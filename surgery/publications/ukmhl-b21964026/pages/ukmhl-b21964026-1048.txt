1022 TREATMENT OF INTERNAL HEMORRHOIDS. Forceps and clamp applied to hemorrhoids. (Fig. 815), which is not provided with ivory plates, thus rendering the blades thinner and enabling one to grasp a larger amount of the hemorrhoidâ€”a matter of importance when small Eig. 816. growths are being operated upon. In operating by this method the hemorrhoid is grasped with forceps and drawn outward; the clamp is then applied to its base, and the handles are firmly pressed together and se- cured by a screw. (Fig. 816.) The hemorrhoid is next cut off with scissors, leaving a stump extending above the clamp for about one-eighth of an inch. The tumor should not be cut off too close to the clamp. The stump of the tumor is next thoroughly cauterized with the Paquelin cautery at a dull-red heat. (Fig. 817.) In small hem- orrhoids it is better not to cut away any portion before applying the cautery. After the hemorrhoid has been thoroughly cauterized, the clamp is gradually loosened, and if any bleeding occurs the cautery is reapplied. This procedure is repeated until all the tumors have been clamped and cauterized. The seared sur- faces are dusted with boric acid, or covered with iodoform oint- ment, and pressed back within the sphincter, and an opium sup- pository is introduced into the rectum, after which a gauze pad is applied and held firmly in place by a T-bandage. The pa- tient is confined to bed for about ten days, and the bowels are kept quiet until the fourth day, when they are moved by a laxative or an enema. The use of the cautery is not followed by pain, and very seldom by retention of urine, and the re- sults following its employment as regards the permanent cure of the hemorrhoids are most satisfactory. We prefer the clamp and cau- Fig. 817. Application of cautery to hemorrhoids. tery to any of the other methods employed in the treatment of internal

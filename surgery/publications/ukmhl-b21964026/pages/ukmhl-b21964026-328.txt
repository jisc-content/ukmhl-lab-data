AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT. 302 The Esmarcb bandage is then removed, and a circular incision of the skin and cellular tissue made five inches below the constricting band ; this cuff of skin and cellular tissue should be dissected up to the level of the lesser trochanter; a circular division of all the muscles should next be made at Fig. 244. Disarticulation of head of bone in amputation at the hip-joint. (After Esmarch.) this point, and the bone should be divided with a saw. The femoral artery and femoral vein, the profunda, and auy large muscular branches should now be seized with haemostatic Fig. 245. forceps and ligated. After all vessels which can be located have been ligated, the rubber tube is removed, and any vessels which bleed should be grasped with haemostatic forceps and secured. The sawn surface of the femur is next seized with bone forceps, and an incision is made upon the outer side through the muscles until the neck and head of the bone are exposed, when the disarticulation should be accomplished.

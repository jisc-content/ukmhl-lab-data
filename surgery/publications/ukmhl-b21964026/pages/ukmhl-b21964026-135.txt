ADENOMA. 115 trophy of a gland there is an increase in the amount of the glandular tissues, but they retain their functional powers, while in adenoma the cells are with- out function and there are no ducts. An adenoma is usually encapsulated and distinct from the gland-tissue, but sometimes the entire gland may be involved in adenomatous degeneration, and in such cases it is not easy to distinguish the neoplasm from simple hypertrophy. With the exception of the ovarian or thyroid cysts, the tumors are not of large size. Occurrence.—Adenoma is common in the glands of the mucous mem- branes, and is also found in those of the skin. It frequently occurs in the thyroid, the ovaries, the mamma, the testicles, and the rectum, and less commonly in the kid- ney and the liver. Structure.—The structure of adenoma is seldom exactly like that of the gland from which it springs, adenoma of the kidney being a simple tabular glandular structure, quite different from the convoluted tubules of the kidney, and ade- noma of the intestine being far more complicated than the Lieberkiihn's glands from which it origi- nates. In the breast the structure looks like normal mammary tissue, except that there are no ducts (Fig. 78); but pure adenoma of the breast is rare, the tumors gen- erally being largely composed of fibrous tissue. In some cases the intestinal adenomata are polypoid in shape and are quite benign, but in others the Fig. 79.

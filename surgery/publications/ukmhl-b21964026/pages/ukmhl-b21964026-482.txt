FRACTURE OF THE SHAFT OF THE HUMERUS. 456 Treatment.â€”The treatment consists, first, in making extension and manipulation to reduce the deformity ; a primary roller should then be ap- plied to the arm from the tips of the fingers to the axilla; a well-padded internal angular splint (Fig. 363) applied to the inner surface of the arm, extending from the tips of the fingers to the axilla, and a well-padded shoulder-cap of binders' board or Fig. 363. leather, extending from above the acromion to a point just above the condyles, should next be fitted upon the outer surface of the arm (Fig. 364), and secured by a bandage car- ried from the hand to the shoulder. (Fig. 365.) The arm should then be carried in a sling suspended from the internal angular splint. neck. Another very satisfactory dress- ing for fracture of the shaft of the humerus consists in the application of a primary roller, as just described, and a short, well-padded splint, extending from the axilla to the inner condyle ; three coaptation splints, extending from the shoulder to the elbow, are next applied to the anterior, outer, and posterior surfaces of the arm, Fig. 364. Application of splint and shoulder-cap in dressing for fracture of the shaft of the humerus. being held in position by a roller bandage. After the splints have been securely fixed, the arm should be bound to the side of the chest by circular turns of the bandage, and the forearm carried in a sling suspended from the neck. In the employment of either of these methods the dressings should be removed on the second day, the arm sponged with alcohol, and the splints reapplied in the same manner. The subsequent dressings should be made at intervals of two or three days, and the use of the splints continued for about six weeks. During the changing of dressings the patient will be saved much pain and the deformity will be lessened if an assistant keeps up extension of the arm from the elbow.

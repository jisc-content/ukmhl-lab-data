BURSITIS. 421 with, and is commonly known as housemaid's knee (Fig. 319), resulting from long-continued pressure upon the knee, occurring in those whose occupation causes them constantly to bear pressure upon this part. Chronic bursitis with enlargement of the bursa over the olecranon is also occasionally seen, and is known as miner's elbow. Subdeltoid bursitis is sometimes observed. Gumma of the prepatellar bursa is very common, and should be sus- pected in every case of suppuration of this bursa without assignable cause. It often results in extensive sloughing. Hernial protrusion of a portion of a bursa is sometimes seen after in- juries of bursa?. (Fig. 320.) Disease of the subligamentous bursa is indicated by swelling upon the side of the ligament, which becomes most prominent when tension is made upon the ligamentum patellae. Treatment.â€”The treatment of chronic bursitis, if the sac is distended with fluid, consists in removal of the fluid by aspiration, or by making an incision and introducing a drainage-tube. The greatest care should be observed to keep the wound aseptic. The bursa may be removed by dis- section. This is the only treatment which is likely to be of use in cases where the bursa is very thick or is converted into a solid tumor. In re- moving these growths by dissection great care should be exercised to avoid opening neighboring joints. Subligamentous bursa? are often treated by aspiration, as the risk of opening the joint is very great if attempts are made to dissect them out. Fig. 319.

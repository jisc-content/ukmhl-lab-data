777 TUMORS OF THE PALATE. Tuberculosis of the palate, if primary, under treatment may terminate favor- ably, but in the majority of cases, as it is associated with tuberculosis of other parts, the prognosis is unfavorable. Treatment.—This consists in the use of anti-tubercular remedies, tonics, fresh air, and a change of climate. The local treatment consists in the use of mild antiseptic washes, and, if the disease is localized, curetting the ulcerated surface and painting it frecpiently with an ethereal solution of iodoform may be followed by healing. TUMORS OF THE PALATE. Sarcoma of the Palate.—This form of growth is more common in the palate than epithelioma, and its treatment should be early removal, but, un- fortunately, recurrence usually takes place rapidly. Epithelioma of the palate may also occur as a primary growth, but generally results from exten- sion of the growth from the mouth and tongue. The lymphatic glands are involved early in the disease. The treatment consists in early removal of the growth. Adenomata of the Palate.—Various forms of adenomata, adeno-fibroinata, adeno-myxoniata, or adeno chondromata may be observed in the palate. The growths usually increase slowly in size. They should be removed early, and have no tendency to recur. Ncevi, as well as mucous, dermoid, and sebaceous cysts, may also occupy the palate. Lipomata, fibromata, and aneurisms of the posterior palatine artery and meningoceles are occasionally observed in this location. The treat- ment of these various lesions should be conducted upon the same general principles as for similar lesions in other parts of the body.

CEREBRAL LOCALIZATION. 728 tlie measured line. The fissure runs forward, making an angle of sixty- seven degrees with, the middle line (Fig. 653), and this angle can be laid off by the use of the cyrtoineter, which is a strip of flexible metal marked Fig. 650. External guides to the lateral sinus, etc. From the Lancet, in Sajous's "Annual of the Universal Medi- cal Sciences." g*, external auditory meatus ; h, h', Reid's base-line marked in one-eighth inch spaces; x, x, level of tentorium : /, lateral sinus; TS, anterior end of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. Trephine openings: A, for lateral sinus; B, to explore roof of tympanum ; C, for mastoid antrum; D, for temporo-sphenoidal abscess; E, for cerebellar abscess. with a scale of inches or centimetres and having a similar strip fixed at an angle of sixty-seven degrees. (Figs. 651 and 652.) Eeid has given an easy practical way of finding the angle of sixty-seven degrees for the fissure of Eolando. If a piece of paper is cut with an angle of ninety degrees, Fig. 651.

(Bramwell.) and folded so that the two sides of the right angle lie together and the crease runs straight to the point, each of these angles will measure forty-five degrees. One side of the paper is then doubled again, so that its edge lies

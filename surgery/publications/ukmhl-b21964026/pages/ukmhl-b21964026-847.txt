IRIDECTOMY. 821 while the blade is slowly thrust onward until the section is of the desired extent. (Fig. 713.) The knife is then slowly withdrawn, its point being kept well forward towards the posterior surface of the cornea. FlG- 713- The iris forceps are now intro- duced through the lips of the wound, the pupillary margin of the iris is seized, and a por- tion of the iris is withdrawn, which is then cut off with one or two snips of the iris scis- sors close to the margin of the wound. (Fig. 714.) An iridectomy may be broad and peripheral, or nar- row, or occasionally quite small, with preservation of the ciliary border. The most common indications for iridec- tomy are— . (1) For optical purposes— that is, to replace an occluded or an excluded pupil—a nar- row iridectomy should be per- formed. (Fig. 715.) (2) To relieve tension and open the periphery of the anterior chamber —as, for example, in the treatment of glaucoma—a broad peripheral iridec- tomy should be performed. (Fig. 716.) Fig. 715.

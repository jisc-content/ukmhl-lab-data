OPERATIONS FOR LACERATED PERINEUM. 1170 nal flap is then picked up with toothed forceps or a tenaculum and drawn directly forward, while a similar instrument pulls the centre of the rectal flap directly backward, converting the transverse diamond-shaped opening to a median diamond. Sutures are then introduced transversely (Fig. 882), Fig. 881. Fig. 882. Incision for split-flap method. (Madden.) Split-flap method ; first suture. (Madden.) the first suture being placed in the middle of the wound at the angles of the former horizontal incision. Working backward from this point, parallel stitches are passed until the posterior angle is closed. A few silk sutures are passed anteriorly, bunching up the vaginal flap, and the originally horizontal incision is converted into a vertical one. Sutures.â€”Either silk, silkworm-gut, or catgut may be employed for sutures. Silver wire is not much used now. The needles may be straight, but a curved Hagedorn is much easier to use, and a needle on a handle (Fig. 883) may be employed with advantage by the novice. In all these Fig. 883. Needle on a handle. (Peaslee needle.) operations a continuous buried suture may be introduced. The wound is spread widely open, a curved needle threaded with fine chromicized catgut is introduced at the bottom of the wound, picking up a little of the raw surface on each side, and the thread is tied. A continuous suture is then passed, running along the deepest part of the wound, picking up only a little tissue on each side. Having made this first tier, a second tier is introduced, and so on in successive steps until the entire wound is closed. It is well to interrupt the stature by a knot at intervals. The edges of the mucous membrane may be united by buried sutures also, or ordinary stitches can be employed. When this buried suture is employed in cases in which there has been much lateral injury of the fascia, it is wise to add

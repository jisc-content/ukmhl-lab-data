After the removal of the gauze an Outerbridge wire intra uterine stem is to be inserted and worn for some weeks in order to secure good drainage, and the intra-uterine applications are to be made at gradually lengthening intervals. If a cure is not obtained, the possibility of a chronic salpingitis discharging through the uterus is to be borne in mind. Inflammation of the cervical mucous membrane is recognized by the cysts in the Nabothian glands which result from it, and by erosions of the os. The term erosion (Fig. 896) is given to a bright red papillomatous condition of the mucous membrane resembling an ulcer covered by small velvet-like granulations, but there is no true ulcera- tion here, the epithelial layer being intact. An eversion of the cervical mucous membrane due to a laceration has a somewhat similar appearance at times, and may be mistaken for it. The treat- ment of this inflammation is similar to that for endometritis of the fundus, but the cysts should be punctured as soon as they form. In obstinate cases the vaginal portion may be split laterally (Schroe- der's operation, Fig. 897), the internal cervical mu- cous membrane extirpated, and the mucous mem- brane of the vaginal surface turned in and secured by sutures so as to cover the raw surface. The use of caustics for erosions is dangerous, from the possibility of setting up malignant disease. Erosion of cervix. Veit.) (Ruge and Fig. 897.

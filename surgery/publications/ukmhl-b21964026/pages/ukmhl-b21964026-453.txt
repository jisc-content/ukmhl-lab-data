427 VARIETIES OF FRACTURE. tion occurring at the cartilaginous line of union, is usually classed among fractures. (Fig. 325.) The injury generally occurs in persons under twenty years of age, and is said to interfere markedly with the subsequent growth of the bone. Direction of Fracture.—In cases of fracture the line of separation may be oblique, transverse, longitudinal, or spiral. Fig. 326. Oblique fracture of the femur with shortening. Oblique Fracture.—This is the most common variety of fracture, and is one in which the line of separation is at an acute angle to the long axis of the bone. (Fig. 326.) Transverse Fracture.—In this variety of fracture the line of separa- tion is at right angles to the long axis of the bone: it is much less commonly met with than oblique fracture. (Fig. 327.) The ends of the bone in transverse fracture are often dentated, preventing the occurrence of much dis- placement. Transverse frac- tures are often seen in the short and flat bones and in the spongy ends of the long bones, and are not infrequent in the shafts of the long bones in children. Spiral Fracture.—This form of fracture is occasionally seen in the long bones, and consists of a fissure which winds around the shaft more or less obliquely. (Fig. 328.) It is most often observed in the tibia, femur, and humerus, and results from violent torsion of the bone ; experiments with fresh bones have demonstrated that spiral fractures could be so produced.

Longitudinal Fracture.—In this variety of fracture the line of separa- tion runs in the general direction of the long axis of the bone. (Fig. 329.)

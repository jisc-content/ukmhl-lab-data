567 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. Causes.—Subspinous dislocations are produced by force applied to the anterior surface of the shoulder. Fig. 490. Fig. 491. Subclavicular dislocation of the humerus. (After Agnew.) Subspinous dislocation of the humerus. (Agnew.) Luxatio Erecta.—Among the rare dislocations of the head of the humerus is that known as luxatio erecta. (Fig. 492.) In this dislocation the arm is held vertically, the forearm resting on the top of the head and being held there by the patient to escape the pain caused by lowering it. Fig. 492. Fig. 493. Luxatio erecta. Supracoracoid dislocation. (Hamilton.) Subluxation of the Head of the Humerus.—A condition described as subluxation of the head of the humerus is one which is distinguished by a depression beneath the acromion upon the posterior aspect of the joint, and a well-rounded prominence formed by the head of the humerus lying in contact with the coracoid process. This injury should rather be described as a rupture of the long tendon of the bicej)s muscle, in consequence of which the supraspinatus muscle draws the bone out of its normal position.

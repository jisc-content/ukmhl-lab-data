OSTEOTOMY. 655 Fig. 585. introduced. If the osteotome is used, it is driven carefully through the bone with strokes of the mallet, being held as shown in Fig. 588. If the saw is employed, the bone is carefully di- vided by short strokes. It is not always neces- sary to divide the bone completely; a small portion of the posterior surface may be left undi- vided, the osteotome being withdrawn, and the remaining portion of bone fractured by manual force. This procedure is a safer one than com- plete division when large vessels lie in close con- tact with the posterior surface of the bone. Cuneiform Osteotomy.—In this operation a wedge-shaped piece of bone is removed with a chisel or with a saw. The mechanism of the correction of the deformity by this operation is shown in Fig. 589. The limb is placed upon a sand-bag, and the bone is exposed by turning up a flap, or by a transverse incision, and retracting the soft parts. A wedge-shaped section of bone, of sufficient size to permit of the correction of the deformity, is then removed. This operation is most frequently employed in cases of anterior tibial curvature, Linear osteotomy : ab, line of sec- tion of the bone ; abc, gap left after correction of the deformity. Fig. 586.

After-Treatment.—The small wounds in subcutaneous osteotomy are covered with a compress of iodoform gauze or with a scab of gauze and iodoform collodion, and in cuneiform osteotomy the edges of the flap or of the incision should be held in position by sutures and covered with a steril- Fig. 587.

A pad of cotton is placed over the dress- ing, the bony prominences are also padded, a flannel bandage is applied to the whole limb, and while the limb is held in the corrected position a plaster of Paris bandage is applied to the part. This dressing is usually allowed to

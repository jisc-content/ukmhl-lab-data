Healing by Granula- tion.â€”When a wide gap has been produced by retraction or actual loss of tissue, heal- ing takes place by granula- tion, as it is called, a process which differs from that just described merely in the fact that more tissue has to be re- produced. The outpouring of blood and serum, occlusion of vessels, congestion, multi- plication of fixed cells, emi- gration of leucocytes, and production of vascular buds and loops goes on as before. But as the formative changes advance, small, round eleva- tions of a rosy color appear on the new surface, making it look like velvet. These rounded elevations of the healing surface are called granulations. They advance steadily on all sides, filling the gaping wound until the level of the original surface is reached, the new tissue organizing behind them, and contracting as it organ- izes, so that the space to be filled is daily made smaller by this contraction as well as by the production of new tissue. (Fig. 34.) As the surface is reached the epithelial cells on the edges of the granulating area slowly spread over it, the granulations generally project- ing above the adjoining sur- face, and the epithelium grow- ing over them as they contract again to their proper level. The advancing line of epider- mis is visible as a pale pink line, gradually whitening with time. When a wound has been Fig. 33.

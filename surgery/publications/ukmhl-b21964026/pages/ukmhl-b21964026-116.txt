96 OSTEOMA. Structure.—The structure is simply that of either cancellous or com- pact bone, without any regular arrangement, except that in globular tumors the fibres are placed in concentric layers, because they grow from an ex- ternal layer of cartilage ossifying behind it. (Fig. 55.) Exostoses may be met with on the face, attached especially to the jaws or frontal bones, and similar tumors are found in other parts of the skeleton, particularly in the flat bones. Those on the skull are sometimes densely hard, and no Haver- sian canals can be seen in them, whence they are called ivory or ebur- nated exostoses. Another form of osteoma is that which grows from the epiphyseal ends of the long bones, produced by the ossification of tumors originally cartilaginous. Ossification is found extending from the bone down into the attachments of ligaments and muscles, forming irregular exostoses more or less pointed at the free end, where they terminate in the muscles or tendons. These masses are not properly osteomata. Occurrence.—The various bones differ in their liability to osteoma, the phalanges, the femur, the tibia, the humerus, the vertebrae, and the flat bones, Hi mif ^ Osteoma of femur, x 200. (Aguew.) such as the scapula, being liable in the order given, but there is no bone that is entirely free from it. Osteoma may grow from the phalanges under the nails, lifting the latter. Although osteoma usually springs from bone, or at least from periosteal tissue, it also occurs rarely as an independent neoplasm in such organs as the breast, the testicle, and the brain, from ossification of cartilaginous tumors. Osteomata are multiple in one-tenth of the cases, and this variety seems to be hereditary in some families, in which, curiously enough, they often affect only the males, the female side escaping. Clinical Appearance.—Osteomata form hard, rounded tumors, often more or less pedunculated, frequently lobulated on the surface. The skin

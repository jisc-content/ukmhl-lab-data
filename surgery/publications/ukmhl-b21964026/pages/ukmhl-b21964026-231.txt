Harelip sutures are frequently employed in plastic operations about the face or other parts of the body where accurate apposition of the flaps is desired. Quilt or Mattress Suture.—This form of suture is made with silk or catgut, and is em- ployed in wounds where it is important to have Fig. 149. Twisted or harelip suture.

Quilled Suture.—In applying this suture, a needle armed with a double thread of wire or silk is passed through the tissues as in applying the interrupted suture, but at a greater distance from the edges of the wound ; the quill, or a piece of flexible catheter or roll of gauze, is inserted into the loops on one side of the wound, and on the opposite side the free ends of the sutures are carried around a similar object before being tightened. (Fig. 150.) This variety of suture makes deep and equable pressure along the whole line of the wound. In using this form of suture it is often found advisable to introduce a few superficial inter- rupted sutures along the line of the wound, to secure accurate approximation of the skin. Fig. 151.

The use of deep or buried sutures to secure accurate apposition of the deep portions of the wound has largely supplanted the use of this variety of suture. Button or Plate Suture.—In applying this suture, a thread armed with two needles is first passed through the eyes of a button or through perforations in a lead plate. The needles are next carried through the edges of the wound, and upon the opposite side are passed through the eyes 14

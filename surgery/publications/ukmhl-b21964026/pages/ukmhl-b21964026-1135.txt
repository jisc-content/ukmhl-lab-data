Litholapaxy has of late been strongly advocated for children and infants, for although the operation is particularly difficult, because of the small size of the urethra, with instruments of proper size (12 to 18 French) excellent re- sults have been obtained. The Anglo-Indian surgeons have operated on many hundreds of young children with a mortality of only from one to three per cent. Lithotomy.—The bladder may be opened in the perineum or above the pubes. Formerly the perineal operations were preferred : they are of two kinds—the median and the lateral. Median Lithotomy.—In the median operation the patient is placed upon the back, with the thighs flexed upon the abdomen, and a sound with a groove upon its lower surface, called a staff, is introduced into the bladder.

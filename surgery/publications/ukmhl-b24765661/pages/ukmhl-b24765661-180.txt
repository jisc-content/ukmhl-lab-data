( *0 ) mation, and abscesses which were opened and gave rise to three sinuses. Dorsal dislocation of femur; hip rigidly flexed; limb shortened and wasted,’ somewhat inverted; shaft of femur thickened: curved incision made behind trochanter major. Necrosed head of femur removed, and seven or eight pieces of dead bone taken out. Limb placed in straight position and secured by long splint and weight; recovery slow. Two sinuses, on the anterior and inner aspect of the thigh, continued long to discharge. Was eventually able to walk with the aid of crutches, and left hospital after a stay of 312 days, in good health and every prospect of regaining the use of the left leg ; the new hip joint admitted of a considerable range of movement. IV. 1. Wire suturing of fractured patella, a.— European male, ret 50, sustained transverse fracture of right patella, and was treated for 14 days by hyper-extension and strapping. The frag- ments could not be maintained in contact; they were exposed by two vertical parallel incisions about an inch apart, drilled with a bradawl, and brought close together by means of a double twisted silver wire, a large quantity of clot having been cleared out with the finger from between them. The wounds were stitched with iron wire and horse-hair. The operation was performed under strict antiseptic precautions. The wound remained aseptic through- out and pursued an aseptic course. The wires were untwisted and removed 40 days after the operation. There was a slight rise of temperature for two days, and some tenderness of the wound, but no inflam- mation or suppuration occurred. The bone united firmly, and patient left hospital in 102 days, with a useful joint and limb. He sub- sequently fell down some steps and refractured the bone at the same site. The fracture on this occasion was compound owing to the tearing open of the wound. He was treated at the General Hospital.

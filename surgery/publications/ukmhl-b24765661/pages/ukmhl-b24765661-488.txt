PKECI3 OP OPERATIONS. 8 angioma of the veins of the forearm and arm. Soft swellings, consisting of dilated veins, existed above and below the elbow-joint on the radial side and above the wrist, on the same side.

On the6th of January two catgut loops were placed on the swelling below the- elbow at a distance of about 3 inches. The catgut was passed under the veins by means of a curved needle and then backwards over the veins, entering and emerging through the same punctures.

The veins got collapsed and swelling gradually shrank. On the 25th of January the veins above the elbow and wrist were similarly dealt with, four loops being inserted. No suppuration took place on this occasion, but induration, collapse of the veins, and shrinking of the swelling ensued. He was discharged after 63 days’ residence in hos- pital with a useful arm of normal shape and dimensions. 2. Ligature of varicocele by buried loops.— This procedure was adopted in four cases. Three' of the patients were young Eurasian lads and the fourth a European, aged 25. In one case both sideswere operated on simultaneously; in the other three one side only was dealt with. The parts having been washed, purified with soap and ■water and scrubbed with carbolic lotion, the scrotum was grasped in the middle line by the

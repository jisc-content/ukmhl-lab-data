PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 7 (j cases, the two laparotomy cases, the empyasma, the double amputation and the laryngotomy— io of the 20. Tlie two deaths which occurred among the 19 operations for radical cure of hernia were due to broncho-pneumonia, and in one of these the patient contributed to the fatal result by re- moving his dressings and inducing a septic state of wound. The fatal result in the case of ven- tral hernia was in no way connected with the operation. The death after litholapaxy re- sulted from an unfortunate accident. The only case of fatal tetanus was a septic case, a compound fracture of the radius ad- mitted three days after the accident. An- other case of tetanus occurred after herniotomy and open bowel. He was removed by his friends in a moribund state. The experience of the year supports the statement previously advanced regarding the decline of this disease in the hospital since the introduction of antiseptic treatment. Antiseptics.—The same system of dressing wounds, which has been described in previous reports, has been employed during the year. Bichloride of mercury gauze has been ex- clusively used as an outer dressing, and boracic gauze and lint as inner dressings. Equal parts of iodoform and boracic acid have been used for dusting. A septic wound or sore is now a very excep- tional thing in the hospital, and wounds ad- mitted in a septic condition are in most cases rendered aseptic.

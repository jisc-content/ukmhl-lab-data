( i5 .) gangrenous about a week after operation, and re- mained so for six days; constitutional disturbance slight. The wound united by first intention, and discharge gradually became scanty and lymphy. Left hospitafin 45 days with a sound linear cicatrix. a. Epithelioma of lower lip.—Mahomedan male, get. 551 said to be of 2c days’duration. Involved the whole of the lower lip, which was removed by a V-shaped incision • flaps were taken from beneath the chin and raised to the level of the teeth. Union took place, and patient left hospital in 21 days with a good substitute for the lost lip. b. Epithelioma of larynx.—Hindu male, set. 35 ; disease of 7 months’ duration.

The surrounding skin was somewhat infiltrated, and the body of the larynx and right lobe of the thy- roid body were evidently implicated. The disease could be felt with the finger through the rima glottidis ; the epiglottis seemed to be sound. Extirpation of the larynx and thyroid body was performed on the 15th November. An elliptical incision was made around the growth, including it and a liberal margin of skin. The larynx was isolated by dissection ; the thyroid arteries tied with catgut and then divided. The trachea was divided at the second ring, and the larynx removed by scissors. Epiglottis left behind. He was fed by nutrient enemata for a few days, then by means of an elastic catheter passed into the oesophagus through the wound. Healing took place slowly, but without serious hinderance. The anterior wall of the pharynx is deficient to the extent of about 2 inches; the trachseal opening is situated below it.

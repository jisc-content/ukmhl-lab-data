PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. 49 "When the surface of the bladder was laid ully bare, it. was steadied by a sharp hook, trans- fixed, and divided in the middle line by a fcalpel, from above downwards. The stone (pliosphatic) was found to be very friable, and broke down under the forceps into (several fragments, which were removed, and the bladder thoroughly washed out. It was found to oe fasciculated and pouched. A soft catheter was tied in, and a large drain- age tube inserted through the wound, which was not stitched. The catheter was removed in >4, and the tube in 48 hours. Urine was allowed 0 escape by the wound, being caught by a vessel Is the patient lay on his side. The bladder was ivashed out daily with glycerine of borax lotion dr. i to oz. i). For a month the urine escaped mtirely through the suprapubic wound. As the wound contracted, the discharge took place m increasing quantities through the urethra. S”o symptom causing any anxiety arose during nis convalescence; and his health was greatly [improved by diet and tonics. He was discharged 52 days after the operation. The fragments inveighed 14 drams. This calculus could doubtless have been removed by lateral lithotomy or litholapaxy, but 11 feel convinced that suprapubic lithotomy was t he safest and easiest method of dealing with it. 1 have repeatedly convinced myself by operations 'in the dead body that the peritoneum can easily -oe displaced upwards with the forefinger and the bladder opened without difficulty or danger, lu this case rectal distension was impossible. 3.

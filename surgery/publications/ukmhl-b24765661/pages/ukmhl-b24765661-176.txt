( 6 ) joints also flexed and stiff. Has large cicatrices of deep bed-sores on buttocks and heels. Is in very fe'eble health. Three days after admission the right knee was forcibly stretched under chloroform, and put upon a MacIntyre splint. Pulley and weight adapted to leg to maintain extension. This was followed by fever for two days. Got retention of urine which was relieved by catheter ; urethra found to be strictured and fully dilated. Nine days after admission (6 after the first operation), his health having apparently been restored, the left knee was similarly dealt with. This was followed by shock which proved fatal in io hours. On post-mortem examination, both knee joints were found to contain some blood mixed with synovia. Ecchymosis ex- isted around the joint. The popliteal vessels were uninjured. The cavities of the heart, which was flabby and dilated, were full of decolorized clot. The membranes of the brain were in a state of chronic thickening and congestion with effusion into the ventricles ; liver congested, spleen enlarged, kidneys undergoing contraction. [The extension of stiff joints in cases of fibrous ankylosis is a very safe and successful procedure. The stiffness may depend on a great variety of circumstances, and varies exceedingly in degree, and the treatment must be adapted accordingly. The cause may be outside of the joint or inside. If outside, it may depend (a) upon rigidly contracted muscles and prolonged recumbency, or (b) upon the result of inflammatory thickening of the fibrous textures surrounding the joint—the remains of a severe synovitis which has undergone resolution as far as the cavity of the joint is concerned; prolonged retention in a faulty position generally adding to the mischief, or (c) upon cicatrices the result of wound, or ulcer, or abscess. If within the joint, there are (d) fibrous adhesions between opposed /-3rHloirinr»m.- nr minnviiI qnrfnrrs. ihe cartilage or

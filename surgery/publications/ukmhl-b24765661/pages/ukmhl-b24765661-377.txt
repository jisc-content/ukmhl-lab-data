87 PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. Exhaustion.—This term included a great variety of fatal conditions, tending or combining I to cause death. In four cases it indicates the sapping of life caused by recurrence of malig- nant disease; in one the termination of hectic; in one the. effect of sloughing sorethroat, re- lieved, but not cured, by tracheotomy ; in oue asthenia from tramuatic delirium in a subject debilitated by debauchery, drugs and fever; in lone poisoning by cholaemia ; and in one sinking from a serious operation for severe cancer. Septicaemia.—Two of the deaths caused by septic poisoning were cases of extravasation of urine, in which the condition was fully estab- lished before operation was resorted to. In another case a deep aud extensive wound for removal of cancer underwent putrefaction ; and in another of bad smash of the leg septicaemia lexisted before admission, and before amputation was resorted to. Pi/cemia.—In one case the disease existed on admission; in another (double operation for radical cure of hernia) sloughing cellulitis un- doubtedly originated in the hospital. Thus, of the total number of six deaths due to septic poisoning per se,ouly two can be attributed to causes developed during residence iu the hos- pital. Tetanus.—'Two of the cases of tetanus were consequent on operation for strangulated hernia, and the third ou amputation of the leg for gangrene. The remaining causes do not suggest general remarks. 3. Antiseptics have been sedulously used in all cases. The spray has been entirely discarded,

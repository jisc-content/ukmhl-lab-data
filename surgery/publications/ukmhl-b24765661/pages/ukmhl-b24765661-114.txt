; 6 ; (6.)—Hindoo male set. 8. Was inoculated four years ago. This led to necrosis of several bones—right tibia and fibula, left fibula and left humerus. Elbow joint of left side stiff from thickening of lower end of humerus. Resection performed by straight posterior incision. Sequesttum, consisting of 2 inches of lower end of shaft, removed and ends of bones sawn off. Passive motion commenced on 9th day. Abscess formed after wound in cavity had healed, necessitating incision and giving rise to much effusion.

Arthritis of left knee 4 years ago ; history of subsequent suppuration treated by incision ; knee firmly fixed at a right angle ; head of tibia dislocated outwards. Recent abscess of popliteal space opened, and leaving a sinus ; leg wasted. Resected antiseptically by semilunar incision below patella, which was removed. Ends of bones forcibly separated ; ^ an inch sawn off tibia, and about 2 inches off femur. Tendons of semiten- dinosis and biceps divided subcutaneously ; ends of bones drilled and united by twisted wires. Catgut drain brought out at each angle of wound. Pursued an aseptic course. No suppuration or constitutional disturbance ; wound healed by first intention. Drain melted away and ends re- moved in 8 days ; wires removed after 69 days. Left hospital in 150 days with a firm straight limb about 3 inches shorter than the other, and able to walk with a high-heeled and soled shoe. [This case pursued a typical aseptic course.

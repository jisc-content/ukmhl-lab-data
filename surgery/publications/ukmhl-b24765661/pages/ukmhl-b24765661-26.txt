With regard to certain subjects such as anatomy, chemistry and physiology, this arrangement is eminently advantageous, and this has been re- cognized in India. The time was when the pro- fessor of chemistry in Calcutta engaged in general practice, and when physiology was taught by a man encumbered with many other pursuits public and private. The professors of these important subjects are now enabled to devote their undivided time to teaching these branches theoretically and practically,- except in so far as Government avails itself of their special knowledge for cognate purposes. But it is otherwise with the remaining chairs. Their occupiers have had- imposed ou them a multitude of petty and miscellaneous duties which have no direct relation to the subjects which they teach, and the remuneration connect- ed with the chair has been adjusted so that the professors are compelled to engage in general practice for the purpose of earning a liveli- hood. The distinction between the general practitioner and the professor has become a very substantial one in Britain, and it is an emi- nently useful and convenient one. The latter mostly confines himself to consulting practice, which permits of his ordering his own time and reserving for the duties of his chair and for study and research as much leisure as he may consider requisite or desirable.

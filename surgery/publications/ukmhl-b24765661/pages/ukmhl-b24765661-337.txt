The prostate gland was found to be healthy, and he could make water in narrow jets sufficiently to empty his babbler. An attempt was made to pass a cathe- ter, but a very tight stricture was found to exist about three inches from the meatus. The scrotal swelling was punctured with a fine trocar. Urine escaped through the canula with fine aleulous sand. When the cyst was emptied of fluid, it was found to contain a large quantity lof calculous material. The patient was now chloroformed, and the cyst laid freely open in the middle line. About an ounce of calculous gravel and sand, composed, it was afterwards found, of urate of ammonia and phosphate of lime, was removed by a lithotomy scoop. The distant end of the urethra projected into the cyst as a nipple-shaped process about one inch ong at the apex of which a minute opening existed. This was enlarged by incision, and a No. 12 catheter finally carried into the bladder, frwhich was found to be empty. The cyst cavity mvas washed out daily, and a No. 12 catheter ^passed every third or fourth day.

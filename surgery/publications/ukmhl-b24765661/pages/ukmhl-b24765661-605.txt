PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 73 slips out when he strains ;it stool to the size of a walnut, returning on pressure or resuming the erect posture. Sphincter very loose. A wedge of anal verge including the sphincter and loose .rectal mucous membrane was clamped on the right side removed by scissors and cauterized. He recovered rapidly, and was discharged on 2nd August. The sphincter was still loose, and a slight prolapse occurred during stool on leftside, disappearing on standing. The gut remained fixed at the site of stitches, and the rectal wall was smooth and tight. He came to show himself in November with slight prolapse of anal verge during stool; but an operation was not con- sidered necessary. In February 1891 he again presented himself, and at his urgent request the clamp and cautery operation was repeated on left side. He appeared again on the 9th of July 1891, and showed a small protrusion of mucous membrane on straining, but it was not considered necessary to operate. He has not turned up again up to the present (October 1891). *** The foregoing presents a complete narra- tive of this remarkable case. The operation has been described in fuller detail in this journal and in the Lancet. The fixation of the upper part of the rectum to the abdominal wall was satis- factorily and permanently accomplished by the means resorted to, and the procidentia has been undoubtedly cured thereby ; but the relaxed state of the sphincter permits of a protrusion of the anal mucous membrane which will probably continue all his life. The lad had a cancellous exostosis of the lower end of the femur success- fully removed in April 1891.

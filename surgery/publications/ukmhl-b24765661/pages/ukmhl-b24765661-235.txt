[This case is an admirable example of the diffi- culties with which surgery has to contend in a tuberculous subject.] 13. Amputation of the leg for disorganization and ankylosis of knee-joint.—a. Hindu male, aet 40. Had suffered for 10 or 12 years from articu- lar rheumatism. Three months ago inflammation of right knee-joint occurred, which resulted in ab- scess. This was opened, but great destruction of tissue took place on the inner aspect of the knee and thigh. On admission his knee-joint was found to be perfectly stiff and acutely flexed ; leg wasted and cedematous. A large unhealthy ulcer on the inner aspect of the thigh as far down as the head of the tibia. Hip-joint flexed and stiff. Amputation was performed below the knee-joint, which was ankylosed and obliterated. A circular incision was made and the flap dis- sected up ; the tibia was divided quite close to the joint. No stitches were inserted. The oper- ation was performed 4 days after admission, when the ulcer had taken on a healthy action. The flap was trained to cover the end of the bones and the ulcer. Nearly 9 months have now (6th March) elapsed since the operation was done. The ends of the bones have got covered, and the ulcer has nearly healed ; the hip joint has been straightened and the patient’s health greatly improved by tonics and generous diet. The wound remained sweet throughout, slight oozing took place for a few days. No con- stitutional disturbance of any consequence has occurred. Skin grafting has been resorted to

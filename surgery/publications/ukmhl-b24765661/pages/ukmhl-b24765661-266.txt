( 48 ) were decorticated; in the other two the scrotum only was removed—the skin of the penis being healthy. The additional step of dissecting out the sac, tying it at the neck, cutting the rest off and approximating the pillars can be carried out with great ease ; a prolongation of the incision along the cord being all that is requisite One of these cases (v.) was a complete failure. The wound became putrid and gangrenous cellu- litis set in ; severe septic fever ensued and death resulted. Another case was a complete success (xviii), notwithstanding that a putrid haema- tocele had to be dealt with. The third case fxiii) occupies an intermediate position; The wound was aseptic and doing well when tetanus attacked and carried off the patient. It will be observed that castration was found necessary in this case. As a matter of ex- perience I have found that the operation of castration is very frequently followed by teta- nus. There can be no doubt that the combina- tion of these two operations—ablation of scrotal tumour and extirpation of a hernial sac—is a serious procedure ; but in these cases a truss is of very little service and strangulation a more probable contingency than in simple hernia. In five of the cases operation had to be re- sorted to for the relief of strangulation. In all the sac was opened. In four of these the sac was tied and amputated. Two of them (a., c.) died, one of tetanus and one of peritonitis. Two (,de.) recovered under very unpromising circum- tances, &c. In the fifth case the gut was found gangrenous and steps had to be taken to es- tablish an artificial anus. These were unsuccess- ful in consequence of peritonitis and paralysis of the intestines.

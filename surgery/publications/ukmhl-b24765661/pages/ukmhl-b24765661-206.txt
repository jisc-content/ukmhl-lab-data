( 36 ) resorted to for cure of a reducible hernia 11 recover- ed, and, as far as is known, the operation was entire- ly successful. Two cases proved fatal, one of them was an elderly man who exhibited symptoms of car- bolic acid poisoning. The lungs became congested ; he was removed in a moribund state, and died 12 days after operation. The other man died of spread- ing traumatic gangrene on the fourth day. His sys- r tem was damaged by a previous attack of scurvy. The conclusions which I consider that these cases and those previously reported justify, are :— 1. That the operation effectually obliterates an existing hernia in all cases and prevents the formation of another rupture on the same side in the great majority of cases. 2. That its performance does not add materially to the risk when strangulation or incarceration de- ■ mands surgical interference. 3. That when performed in a young and healthy subject with strict antiseptic precautions, it is not ac- : companied with any material risk to life, but 4. When the subject is old or sickly, or when the wound becomes septic, that considerable danger to life exists.] 4. Fishila in ano.—(a).

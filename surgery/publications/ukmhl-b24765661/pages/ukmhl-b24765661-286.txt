( 68 ) 8 times at intervals of 7 to 10 days, from 5 to 6 oz. being evacuated on each occasion. Fever followed the first two operations. It was intend- ed to increase the amount of fluid injected, but the parents grew impatient and withdrew the child after 64 da>'s’ residence in hospital. The treatment did no good whatever. A large aper- ture could be discovered in the back of the sacrum when the tumour was emptied. 3. Cystic tumour of neck tapped.— H indu male, set. 50. Fluid tumour on right side of neck, of 10 years’ duration. Experienced pain from pressure on the brachial plexus. 5 ounces of clear serous fluid were withdrawn by a small trochar and the tumour collapsed. Patient left hospital the same day and has not since returned. General Remarks I. Death-rate.—The mortality of the year was high—1 S'8 per cent. The death-rates of the four preceding series of operations were,— 1879, 18 5 ; 1880, 107 ; 1881, 15 2, and 1882, 9-9. To the deaths which actually took place in hospital must be added 3 cases which were removed in a moribund state, so that 20’5 would more correctly represent the true mor- tality among these cases, which were, with exception of one or two instances treated to the end. It will be observed that in a large pro- portion of the fatal cases operation was resorted to under very unfavourable or desperate circum- stances, with a faint hope of saving life otherwise certainly and inevitably doomed. The dread of a high death-rate has never been permitted to irterfere with an obvious duty in such cir- cumstances.

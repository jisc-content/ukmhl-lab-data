( 12 ) does not or may not bear more or less directly on the objects of our studies and efforts. Then, secondly, observe how vain it is to expect finality in medicine and how foolish to reproach its ministers with changes in theory and practice. Science is ever moving forward, ever addino- to its conquests, ever gaining in breadth, in accuracy, in clearness,and in truth; and every such advance in scientific knowledge imports wisdom and power into our proceedings as doctors. From this consideration springs the obligation of diligence, of incessant study, of observation and experi- ment, of continual striving to learn as long as the facultyof learn ing remains; and this very un- certainty and mutability of the science of medi- cine, which is cast as a reproach by the thought- less, constitutes to the earnest and studious the great attraction and charm which the profession of medicine possesses. Thirdly, note the wide scope which these views impart to our profession as an art. Drugs and operations (and in these terms I include all medi- cinal and mechanical methodsof treatment) do not represent the end and object of our calling. It is our business to study all influences, climatic, hygienic, dietetic, and medicinal, which affect the body for good or evil, and so control these as to maintain health, guard against disease, and restore soundness. Drugs and operations are the least and last of our resources. Fourthly, with what dignity and importance does this aspect invest our profession. There is nothing in nature which does not directly or indirectly concern us, and no situation or act of any human being which may not interest us.

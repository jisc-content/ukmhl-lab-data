( 58 ) cleft to paralyse tensor palati; edges pared and brought together by horse-hair sutures. Stitches removed in G, 7 and 11 days: result satisfactory. Bemained 20 days in hospital. 3. Harelip.—Both cases were single without any pala- tal or dental complication ; edges pared and brought to- gether by horsehair ; result satisfactory. 4. Tongue tie—Hindu male set. 26. Congenital; tongue atrophied ; articulation very defective ; frsenum divided by scissors and finger ; movements of tongue rendered freer. Mastication facilitated ; breech not improved. 5. Circumcision, a.—East Indian set. 14. Chancroid sores round preputial orifice ; phimosis. Prepuce removed, ulcers revealed on glans, they were touched with nitric acid. Stitches draged ; wound healed by granulation. Discharged in 34 days. b. —Eurasian set. 201. A similar condition similarly treated; healed by granulation in 30 days. Satisfactory result. c. —Eurasian set. 9. Congenital phimosis ; collection of smegma in preputial cavity ; balanatis and cedematou3 prepuce. Operation as in previous cases. Wound healed by granulation in 19 days. d. —Eurasian set 18. Condition similar to cases a and b ; similarly treated. Healed in 24 days. e—Similar condition treated in the same way ; healed satisfactorily in 31 days. [The mode of operating adopted in these cases was :— an oblique section of the prepuce and subsequent vertical section of its mucous membrane on each side of the glans, the edges of the latter being stitched to the skin edges by horse-hair sutures all round. The inflammatory infiltration of tissue caused these to drag in every instance. The result was, however, good in all the cases. A sufficient amount of prepuce remaining to cover tho corona and part of the glans surface.]

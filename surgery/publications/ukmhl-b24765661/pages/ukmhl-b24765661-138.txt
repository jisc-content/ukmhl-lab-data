( 30 ) the scrotal and penile tissues. 1. To the first category belong cases a—ni.—13 in all. These cases were operated on under strict antiseptic precautions, the parts being thoroughly washed with a 1—20 carbolic lotion before the operation, and the spray kept in full play during the operation and dressing. Precautions were also taken to minimise bleeding by the use of an elastic bandage before the operation and an elastic cord encircling the neck of the tumour during it, the latter being held back in most cases by being attached by means of rapes to a waist- belt. The penis and testes were exposed and isolated in the usual manner and the mass removed by circular incision ; as much skin as was really sound being left at the sides. In all cases the raphe was freely removed, because experience has shown that it is peculiarly prone to undergo thickening. In one case of this series (a) the skin of the penis was not removed because it had under- gone no thickening. In decorticating the penis care is taken to remove every scrap of integument including the lining membrane of the preputial cavity. In one case this was left, and underwent cedematons thicken- ing. In all cases the tunica vaginalis was opened, unless adherent from previous inflammation naturally occurring or artificially induced This step is necessary in order to prevent future hydrocele The membrane was pared off to within a quarter of an inch of its reflection from the surface of the testis on one side and the epididymis on the other. This collar is left for the purpose of stitching. This is accomplished in the following way A needle is threaded with carbolised catgut, the testes are sewn together by continuous suture by means of the collar of tunica vaginalis left attached to them, care being taken to leave the epididymis outside. The outer rim is then sewn to the surface of the peri- naeal wound Latterly I have found it best to attach the inner rims to the centre of the perinseal tissue and

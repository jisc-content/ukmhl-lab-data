PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. 62 the passage of instruments. This was divided by Civiale’s urethrotome, and no difficulty was subsequently experienced. 10<7. External urethrotomy ( Cock's operation). —i. Hindu male, cat. 30. Admitted with re- tention due to stricture of eight months’ standing. The bladder had been tapped with a fiue trochar above the symphysis. It was found impossible to introduce a catheter. There was a hard swell- ing of the perinseuin, the prepuce was oedema- tous, and bladder distended. Patient low and anxious. The perinaeum was transfixed with a straight bistoury which entered the cavity of an abscess. Through this a Syme’s catheter was introduced into the bladder and retained. Incisions were made in the cedematous prepuce. The result of the operation was satisfactory. The urethra was dilated, and kept dilated by occasional passage of instruments. Discharged in 36 days with perinseal wound closed, and able to make water in full stream. ii. Hindu male, cet. 30. Admitted with re- tention due to stricture and boggy fluctuating swellings in the perinaeal and suprapubic regions. Instruments could not be introduced into the bladder. Tongue dry. General condition low. The bladder was reached by Cock’s method, and the suprapubic and perimeal swellings freely incised. They emitted very foetid pus and com- municated with each othei’. Drainage tubes were inserted, and a Syme’s catheter tied in. He was relieved by the operation, and did well for two days. He then got high fever, diarrhoea, and hiccup, and died of septic poisoning on the fifth day after operation.

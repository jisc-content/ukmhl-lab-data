( 5 ) veration succeeds in this world. And in no de- partment of business is wide and blatant adver- tising so useful as in that of the charlatan. I need not waste time by exposing the folly, or temper by denouncing the mischievousness of this kind of practice. It is a case of knavery on one side and simplicity on the other. Assuredly the barefaced advocacy of an in- terested vendor constitutes no sufficient reason for the use of a nostrum which is credited on no foundation of fact with attributes little short of miraculous. 2. Another basis of practice which is more plausible, but at the same time very deceptive, if not dangerous, is simple imitation. Something has been advantageously done or given in certain circumstances, and the argument is that the same thing is always likely to be equally advantage- ous in the same or similar circumstances. This seems reasonable enough ; but there are two pos- tulates which are necessary for the successful application of this principle, namely, first, that the reputed effect has really been achieved by the means employed; and, second, that the cir- cumstances are the same. In order to settle these postulates, skilled observation p,ud careful iuquiry are necessary, and these are generally wanting in this sort of practice, which is usually adopted by ignorant persons and in a blind hap- hazard sort of way. Rational imitation ground- ed on scientific knowledge and thorough study of pathology and therapeutics is legitimate; but mere imitation without such knowledge and study is beset with fallacies aud perils at every step.

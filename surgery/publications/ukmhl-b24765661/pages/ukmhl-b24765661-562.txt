About thirty-five days ago great toe of left foot became discoloured, and part of it including the terminal phalanx dropped off. The remaining phalanx was removed, and the wound healed by granulation in 43 days. *** The reduced mortality of amputations con- stitutes one of the most satisfactory incidents in the surgical history of the Medical College Hos- pital.

7 PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. years’ duration. The mass was exposed and ligatured in two places—above the testicle and at the internal ring—and then excised. The wound remained aseptic and healed by first in- tention in 11 days. ii. Hindu male, cat. 23. Varicocele of right side of one and a half years’ duration. A simi- lar operation was performed. The upper end accidentally escaped out of the catgut loop into the inguinal canal, hut was “ fished ” out by clamp forceps and retied after transfixion. The wound healed by first intention in ten days. A hydrocele on the same side was successfully tapped and injected a few days after. * *In both these cases a small drainage tube was inserted and retained for a few days. The result of the operation in both cases was highly satisfactory. III. Operations on Joints. \a. Reduction of dislocation of hip-joint.— In two of these cases of 3 and 42 days’duration reduction was effected by manipulation under chloroform. The joint was kept at rest for a fortnight, and movement, was then resumed. In another case of 36 days’ duration extension by puliies was required and succeeded after manipulation had failed. In another case of seven days’ duration the rim of the acetabulum had been broken and the head of the bone escaped out of the cavity as soon as the traction was dis- continued. A satisfactory result was obtained by continued extension by means of pully and weight for a month. The joint was a little stiff but useful. In another case of dorsal dislocation of ten days’ standing reduction was effected

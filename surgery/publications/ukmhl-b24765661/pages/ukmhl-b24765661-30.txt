( 2 ) the figures by written descriptions. This is the plan which has been followed by Professor Spence of Edinburgh (vide 'Jlie Edinburgh Medical Journal, Nov. and Dec. 1879), and he has striven to avoid both the dangers to which allusion has been made. As regards classification, if that laid down in the “ Nomenclature of Diseases” were followed, though it is neither exhaustive nor perfect, a more accurate com- parison of results would be possible. In preparing this paper I have followed the classification in question as closely as possible, and have adopted Professor Spence’s plan of giving details of all cases, short or long* according to their relative importance and the necessity of explanation. Every operation performed in the Second Surgeon’s wards during the year has been included. These wards were under the charge of Surgeon-Major W. J. Palmer, M. D., during the first three months of the year, and under my own during the last nine. The details now published will give a good idea of the surgical practice of the Hospital and constitute the commencement of a sexies of similar reports which I hope to be able to prepare from year to year. Of some of the operations performed by Dr. Palmer I possess no personal knowledge. Others were handed over to me when I took over charge. Those performed by Dr. Palmer have been specially indicated. The following return represents the results of the year, and includes all the cases treated in which operations of any kind causing detention in hospital were found necessary :— Description op Operations.

( 7 ) motion; some crackling ; starting at night. Health bad, anaemic ; gums spongy ; leg much wasted but not cedematous; resected about a month after admission after other treatment failed ; semilunar incision below l§vel of patella which was left ; about £ an inch cut off ends of bones ; joint quite disorganised ; bones in- filtrated and soft ; catgut drains inserted ; operation done antiseptically. Considerable local and constitutional disturbance ensued. Cellulitis extended up the femur and resulted in abscess which required free opening ; other abscesses formed communicating with wound cavity. Wound healed imperfectly and a low form of inflammation with profuse suppuration resulting in multiple sinuses, continued ; symptoms of hectic with great emaciation and exhaustion supervened, and it was considered advisable to amputate the limb—71 days after the resection. See below. [It would probably have been better had amputation been performed in this case in the first instance.] III. 1. Sequestrotomy. a.—Hindu male mt. 8 (see II. 2. a (b) ). Necrosjs of shaft of right tibia and fibula and left fibula following small-pox consequent on inoculation 4 years ago. Sequestra removed, cavities scraped out and purified with chloride of zinc (40 grs. to 1 oz.); wounds dressed antiseptically ; wounds remained aseptic and healed rapidly by granulation. b. Hindu male ret. 18. Upper two-thirds of epiphysis of right humerus necrosed ; consequent on an abscess which occurred a year ago. Four sinuses led to dead bone. They were laid open, the cloaca enlarged and sequestrum (5 inches long) removed ; wound purified as in last case and dressed antiseptically. Is still in hospital (3 months after operation), cavity almost filled up. Two sinuses remained whose mouths contracted. These were again laid open and the wound treated for granulation. Arm much shorter than the

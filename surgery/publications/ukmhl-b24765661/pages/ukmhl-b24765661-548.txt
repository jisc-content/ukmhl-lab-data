16 PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. up in gum and chalk after the wounds had quite healed, and patient was allowed to get about on crutches. He was discharged 109 days after operation. The joint was free of swelling and pain; he could walk with comfort. No movement existed at the knee-joint, which was anchylosed in a nearly straight position. Bony union had taken place between the frag- ments. The wires remained in situ and caused no irritation. 3a. Resection of femur for conical stump.— Hindu male, cet. 30.

The end of the shaft had been pushed in front of the epiphysis and uni- on has taken place in that position, seriously impeding flexion of the joint. The projecting

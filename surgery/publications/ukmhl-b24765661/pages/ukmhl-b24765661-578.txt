Repair was very slow in both cases owing to constitutional depravity. 13b. Diseased axillary glands.—Hindu male, cet.. 28. Had had a large sarcoma of left breast removed on 28th of December 1889. The glands of left, axilla underwent rather rapid en- largement during convalescence from that oper- ation, and were extirpated on 16th January 1891. These were found to be infiltrated and cystic. The wound healed in 19 days. 13c.

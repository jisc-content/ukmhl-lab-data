The whole arm was oedematous and the wound gangre- nous. He had considerable constitutional dis- turbance. Both local and general conditions getting worse, the arm was amputated at the middle by the modified flap method. He con- tinued to suffer from fever and symptoms of septicaemia for a fortnight. The stitches gave way and the bone protruded ; the cavity of the wound was eventually closed by granulations, which covered the end of the bone and drew the flaps together. He left hospital 34 days after operation, with a good and sound stump. ii. Mahomedan female, cet. 60.

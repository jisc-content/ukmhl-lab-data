46 PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. cent, of cases treated to the end is unprece- dentedly small. The favourable result is not due to any change in the manner of record, nor any paucity of serious and severe cases as com- pared with previous years ; but may fairly be claimed as a result of improvements in general hygiene and wound management, which have been carried out in recent years. Death causes.—These hardly admit of general review, as they can hardly be arranged in groups. Shock accounts for two deaths, and was due to the combined effects of feeble consti- tution and severe operation. Septiccemia caused three deaths, of which two were urinary cases, and the third, removal of a large tumour of the lower jaw. The only case of fatal septic infection pas- one of erysipelas following an operation for the cure of hernia. The hospital has been singular- ly and happily exempt from this class of dis- eases during the year. Only one fatal case of post operation tetanus (also a hernia operation) occurred. Antiseptics. — The same system of dressing, wouuds has been in use as in the preceding year. This has been fully described in previous com- munications. The spray was not employed in any case during the year, irrigation with car- bolic and bichloride lotions being resorted to in- stead aud with satisfactory result.

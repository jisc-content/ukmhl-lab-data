( 46 ) A tumour was subsequently detected above the great trochanter, which was judged to be a sarcoma. Patient would not consent to any operation for the removal of it, and left hospital greatly relieved after a stay of 48 days. General Remarks. 1. Death-rate.—The general death-rate 9^9 per cent, of cases treated to the end is more favourable than in any of the series previously published. The operations were not less severe than those of former years, and considering the class of patients treated, many of them presenting constitutions damag- ed by malaria, syphilis, unhealthy surroundings, and poor feeding, I am not sanguine that the rate can be reduced much lower. 2. Death causes.—These are shown in the foot note appended to the return which prefaces this paper, and fully explained in the narratives of indivi- dual cases. They may be exhibited thus :— Shock ... ... 2 Tetanus ... ... 2 Septic poisoning ... ... 3 Primary gangrene ... ... 1 Gangrene of bowel ... ... 1 Obstruction of bowel ... ... 1 Secondary haemorrhage ... 1 Phthisis ... ... 1 12 In one of the cases of primary shock (the case of knee-stretching) a comparatively trivial injury induced shock in a subject, of very feeble constitution. In the other case advanced age combined with severe injury, traumatic gangrene and a serious operation to establish the same condition. Both the cases of tetanus had undergone an operation for the removal of scrotal elephantiasis. The state of the wound was satisfactory in each instance, the disease supervened on the ninth day in both, and pursued an acute and rapid

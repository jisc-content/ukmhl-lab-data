PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 67 me seventh day, and a full-sized instrument was subsequently passed every fourth day. The fis- tulie had closed with exception of two, one pubic and one penile, and he was doing well, when, on the 44th day, he was attacked with dysentery which proved intractable. He died of wasting and exhaustion 56 days after operation. iv. Hindu male, cet. 40. Admitted with very tight stricture and eight perinasal fistulas, Wheel- house’s operation was performed. A full-sized instrument introduced per urethram, and Syme’s catheter tied in. This was removed on the third day, and a full-sized instrument subsequently passed at intervals. He left hospital in 69 days with the fistulas and perinasal wound closed, and able to make water in good stream. %* The three operations above illustrated have each their separate sphere and are by no means interchangeable.

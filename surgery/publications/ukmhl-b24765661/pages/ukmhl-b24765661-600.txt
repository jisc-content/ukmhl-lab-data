Incision for imperforate anus.—Hindu female child, six months’ old. Anus absolutely imperforate, passes faices through vagina. An incision was made in front of the tip of the coc- cyx. A director was passed through the recto- vaginal fistula and the rectal cloaca pushed into the wound. The gut was then incised, pulled down, and its edges stitched to the edges of the skin wouud. Fasces came at once through the opening. The stitches were removed on the fourth day. Stools were passed without difficul- ty through the new anal opening, and none came per vaginam. The child was not brought back after that date. 12. Incision for stricture of anus.—Hindu male, aet. 24. Six months previously he applied some caustic to his piles which caused them to slough off. The process of cicatrization reduced the orifice to the size of a crow-quill. This was enlarged by antero-posterior incision in front and behind, aud the edges of the cut were stitched together. About 31bs. of fasces were passed at once. The edges of the wouud healed as stitch- ed, and an excellent anal opening resulted. He remained in hospital 45 days. 13.

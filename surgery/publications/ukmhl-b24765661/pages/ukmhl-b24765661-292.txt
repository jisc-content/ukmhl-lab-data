PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 2 body affected by disease or deformity and sub- jected to operation. I showed that in the old classification while the three principles were held in view in naming and classing, they were . employed without system or uniformity so that in one case the disease was the main governing principle (tumours, calculi, &c.), in another the mode of operating (incision, amputation), aud iu a third the part of the body affected (operation on the eye, bones, joints, arteries, viens, &c.). And, as with the main classes so with the sub-classes, and names; the three fun- damental ideas were transposed according to con- venience or fancy, the general result being a classification without a ruling principle, and, t therefore, an imperfect and confused one. In the new classification of operations, the anatomical basis has been much more largely adopted as a primary principle just as diseases have been more strictly classified in the body of the “Nomenclature” ou the same pijni. There is much to say for this system. It presents a cer- tain unalterable basis of classing, and, both diseases and the methods of dealing with them by operation present great differences according, to the part of the body affected. Compare, for example, cysts of the ovary with cysts elsewhere ; ; cancer of the tongue with cancer of the rectum incision for extravasation of urine with incision for whitlow. The objections to the anatomical plan are that it necessarily separates, and places in different classes, things pathologically or oper- atively identical or similar; and this has beeu felt in framing the new classification so strongly that pathological groups are still retained (tu-

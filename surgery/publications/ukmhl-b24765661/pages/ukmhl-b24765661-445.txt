PRECIS OP OPERATIONS, 19 lie tendonous rsiplie of tlie mylo-hyoid divided. .'Iit-genio-hycid muscles werethenseparated, and she finger carried upwards and backwards on each ide between them and the geuio-hyo-glossi which vere isolated, and their genial attachment nipped across by scissors. The mucous mem- irane of the'floor of the mouth was then divid- ed by scissors as far back as the fauces, and the ihatn of an ecraseur introduced through the sub- neutal wound, and applied to the root of the ongue just in front of the epiglottis. The whole ongue was removed with very little loss of blood iy slowly tightening the chain. A large drain- cre tube was finallv introduced through the ub-mental wound. Patient was fed with a unnel and tube introduced through the nostril, .nd then through the mouth for ten days. The pound healed in 21 days, and he left hospital 29 ays after the operation with no sign of re- urrence; able to feed comfortably and speak in- lelligibly. *m* I have removed the whole and half of he tongue in several other cases by the method lescribeu. The organ is practically isolated by lissection and separation, and the mucous mem- krane of the mouth detached as far back as te -fauces before any blood can enter the nouth. The tongue cau be very completely xtirpated by this method. The sub-mental ivound serves for drainage and prevents lodg- ment of putrid material in the cavity of the blmtli or entry of the same into the stomach or Mugs. There was little or no constitutional dis- turbance in this case. (c.) Cancer of Upper Jaw.â€”i. fiiudu male.

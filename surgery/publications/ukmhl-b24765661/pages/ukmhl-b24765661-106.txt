( 42 ) minimise putridity and remove the irritation and risk of constitutional disturbance liable to follow septic changes occurring on a wounded surface. The benefit to the hospital atmosphere has been un- doubted, and I am able to state confidently that the more completely I have succeeded in preventiug putrescence in a wound, the less suffering has the patient had to endure, and the more speedy his recovery. 3. Hospitalism,—The diseases signified by this term have been, much less frequent in 1880 than in 1879.

The total number of these cases which occurred in the First Surgeon’s wards during the year was 15, namely 3 cases of p3rsemia, 3 of septicEemia, 7 of erysipelas and 2 of sloughing or gangrenous cellulitis. No case in which strict Listerism was established and maintained, suffered from any form of septic infection. Of the 15, G were admitted with the disease already established, 2 developed it in hospital, and in 7 it occurred after operation ; 4 of these were operations for scrotal tumour, 1 amputation of the left half of the lower jaw and submaxillary gland in an old man, and 1 removal of necrosed jaw and plastic operation on cheek in an unhealthy youth. All the cases of pya?mia and septicaemia proved fatal; one case of sloughing cellulitis died, and the other recovered, and two of the 7 cases of erysipelas proved fatal. 4. Catgut.—This material has been used for a variety of important purposes. For the deligation of divided vessels no other ligature has been employed, and in no single case has failure resulted or irritation been caused by cutting the ligature short and leaving it in the wound.

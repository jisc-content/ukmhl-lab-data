( 25 ) to the mouth. The bands were divided under chloroform and the jaws kept apart. This was followed by a little improvement. Removed by his father after a fortnight before the completion of the treatment. (b.) An East Indian girl, set. 7, could hardly open her mouth after an attack of cancrum oris. The bands, which were situated on the right side, were divided under chloroform and the jaws were afterwards separated by means of gags. Discharged almost cured after a month and half. 5. For stricture of rectum.â€”A European infant, aged 12 months. Just after birth great abdominal distension was observed. After careful examination a small open- ing was found at the situation of the anus with a small nodule in front of it. The opening was enlarged by incision next day, and was dilated by wax bougies. Three months afterwards the child was subjected to a second cutting operation on account of contraction of the parts. During the subsequent treatment of the case fistulous communication between the urethra and rectum was established by rough probing (as was described by the mother of the patient). On admission a small open- ing admitting an ordinary index finger was seen in the situation of the anus. A crescentic fold of mucous membrane was situated on the posterior wall of the canal. Urine escaped freely through the so-called anus, and fmcal matter through the urethra. The child had to strain very much during defalcation. He was put under chloroform ; the anal aperture enlarg- ed posteriorly, and then the crescentic band was divided completely. The rectum was pulled down and its edges stitched to the lips of the wound with silk ligature. Within a few days the end of the alimentary canal became adherent to the skin wound. No contraction followed, and the patient was discharged after 52 days. Circumcision was performed for congenital phimosis.

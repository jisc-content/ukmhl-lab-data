( 8 ) the case eventually did well. The other was a fatal case, death having been caused in a feeble unhealthy subject by shock resulting from forcible stretch- ing of the knee joint, the other joint having been similarly treated a few days previously with the result of producing a smart attack of fever. Both joints were found to contain bloody synovium, and ecchymoses were observed outside of them ; but no evidence of inflammation existed on either side.] 3. Incision of knee joint, (a).â€”Hindu male, set. 28, left knee; acute synovitis following chicken pox; the joint was enormously swollen, and on tapping it sero-purulent material issued in large quantity and the cavity collapsed. It re-accumulated in a few days, and a free incision was made under antiseptic precautions into the supra-patellar pouch. A drainage tube was inserted and an antiseptic dressing applied. No further accumulation occurred, and the symptoms, local and constitutional, prompt- ly subsided ; the tube was gradually shortened and finally removed in 18 days. He was discharged in 89 days with a useful joint. b. Hindu male, set. 25, sustained a compound fracture of the left leg, about 24 hours before ad- mission, by a fall on some bricks from a height of about 10 feet. The fracture was oblique and knee joint much swollen. The wound was dressed antisep- tically, but putrefaction supervened. He had great constitutional disturbance. Seven days after admis- sion the knee joint was tapped with a fine trochar and a quantity of sanguineous serum let out. Re-accumulation taking place in three days, it was freely incised above the patella and a drainage tube inserted : this gave great relief. Discharge from the wound remained sweet, and the tube was gradually withdrawn and wound allowed to close. Extensive suppurative cellulitis occurred up and down the limb requiring numerous counter-openings. Several pieces of necrosed bone had to be removed, but the

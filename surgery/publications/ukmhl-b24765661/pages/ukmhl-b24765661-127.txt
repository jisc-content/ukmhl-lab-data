( 19 ) ligatured in two places and then cut. The deep fascia was divided and the sterno-mastoid exposed. The facial artery and vein were ligatured and divided ; the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscles dissected, caught in a catgut loop and held out of the way. The mouth was thrown open by a Smith’s gag ; the external carotid artery tied and held aside. The tumour was then felt through the wound—which was enlarged by a downward incision at right angles to the first. The tumour was separated by finger and scissors, care being taken to cut in the sound structures outside of it, vessels being promptly tied as they bled by catgut ligatures, the ends of which were left long for drainage. All suspicious mucous membrane was removed by scissors and the morbid mass thoroughly' taken away. The wound healed kindly by granulation and was superficial in a fortnight. The patient was fed with a tube for 18 days, and was then able to swallow. He left hospital in good health 35 days after the operation with a sound T shaped cicatrix on the left side of his neck. [This man underwent both of these formidable opera- tions very successfully. Fuller details of them will be found in the Indian Medical Gazette (Vol. XVI., pp. 146, 232 ). I have recently (7 months after last discharge from hospi- tal) seen him again. There is no recurrence of the growth in the pharynx. He is able to talk distinctly and swallow well, but there is a diffuse infiltration below the left ear about the origin of the sterno-mastoid muscle which forms a swelling and impedes the opening of the lower jaw. This swelling subsided somewhat after being painted with iodine, but there is every reason to fear that the tumour has recurred, and in such a way as to preclude any further operative interference.] 6.

PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 15 male, cet. 35. Sustained an injury of right knee- joint 17 months ago. The joint was laid open, and patella severed in two by the tusk of a wild boar. The wound healed in six months, I leaving the fragments of the patella far apart, and the joint in a stiff and semiflexed position. The joint can now be flexed, but not extended beyond an angle of 120Â°. The limb is almost use- less. The hamstring tendons were first divided subcutaneously, and the limb straightened on a ! Macintvre splint, and seven days afterwards, the part continuing weak, a return of flexion threaten- ing owing to the absence of extensor power, I the following operation was performed. The frag- ments were exposed by a longitudinal incision. They were about three inches apart, the upper large and firmly fixed to the trochlear surface of the femur, the lower small and sunk into the intercondyloid notch, borne cicatricial tissue was removed from between them, their opposed surfaces freshened by the chisel and the upper loosened from its adhesions to the femur. It I was now found that approximation of the frag- I ments was impossible. The incision was ac- cordingly prolonged upwards, and the quadri- I ceps extensor divided by a W-shaped incision i after the manner of Lister. The fragments theu I came together, and were drilled and wired. The tips of the W were united by catgut. Lateral openings were made for drainage, and the I wound put up antiseptically. The wound re- j mained aseptic, and healing took place without : local or constitutional disturbance. The tubes 1 were gradually shortened, and finally withdrawn i on the 16th and 20th day. The limb was put

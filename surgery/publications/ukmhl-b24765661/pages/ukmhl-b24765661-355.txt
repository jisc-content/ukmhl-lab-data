65 PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. broncho-pneumonia on the 7th. Patient died of exhaustion 10 days after the operation. iv. Mahoinedau, at. 40. Has suffered from hydrocele of right tunica for 24 years. Had a strong attack of fever five months ago, followed by increase of swelling and great pain, which have continued up to the present. The tunica was laid open, and about a pint of coffee-colour- ed fluid removed. The cavity was washed out, and dressed for granulation. He was discharged, well, 61 days after the operation. Htematocele in old subjects is generally a sequel of hydrocele. The tunica undergoes (Treat thickening and degeneration. A slight }n o o o injury is then sufficient to cause bleeding into its cavity. This may also occur spontaneously from degenerative erosion. Patches of abra- sion are seen in these cases on the interior of the tunica, and it is from these, apparently, that the bleeding takes place. The treatment by free incision is the most ef- fective and speedy. I have tried a small opening and drainage. If putrefaction takes place in the cavity—and this is a probable contingency—the result may be dangerous or fatal. Even if the cavity remains aseptic, the process of repair is very slow. With free incision and complete evacuation, it is easier to avoid putrefaction, and repair is much more rapid. 7. Incision for bubo with removul of inguinal glands. i. East Indian, male, cet. 18.

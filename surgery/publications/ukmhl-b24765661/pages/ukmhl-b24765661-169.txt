( 61 ) patients whose wounds were quite aseptic, and in one whose wound was putrid. Of the bowel complaints, diarrhoea in one case appeared to be caused by imperfect reaction after a severe opera- tion ; in another case was associated with a large putrid sinus, and dysentery in a third case occurred in a patient with liver abscess which had undergone aseptic repair. In one of the cases exhaustion was due to paralysis and viseral sarcoma, in another to long continued hsemor- rhoidal bleeding, and in a third to putrid psoas abscess, admitted in that state. Of the 7 deaths from septic diseaseâ€”all were asso- ciated with putrid wounds; and in 6 instances this condition succeeded operation. In one case, hernio- tomy, in which the bowel had become gangrenous, putrefaction was inevitable ; in another case it was for erysipelatous inflammation existing on admission that the knife was resorted to. These leave a balance of 4 deaths regarding which the question arises, whether, if putrefaction had not invaded the wounds, death would have occurred. I am inclined to think it would not. In none of the miscellaneous cases did putrefaction or septic absorption have anything to do with the result. On the whole the experience of the year is strongly in favour of strict antiseptic surgery and in support of the view that septic complications may be largely if not entirely prevented by the sedulous employment of antiseptic agents.

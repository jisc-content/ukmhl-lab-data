PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. G6 10c. External urethrotomy (Wheelhouses operation).—i. Hindu male, out. 30. Admitted with stricture, which was in process of gradual dilatation, when he absconded. He returned with aggravated symptoms, and intermittent di- latation was again resorted to, hut without satis- factory relief. The urethra was opened in front of the stricture, which was entered and divided on Wheelhouse’s director-probe. The bladder was thus easily reached. A full-sized instru- ment was passed occasionally, and patient absconded a second time before the cure was complete 23 days after operation. ii. Mahomedan male, cet. 50. Fell on his perimeum 28 years ago, injuring his urethra. This injury resulted in stricture, which was dilated 16 years ago by Dr. Lawrie, and re- curring was again dilated three years ago by Dr. McLeod. On this occasion he came with re- tention, and as a catheter conld not be intro- duced, the stricture was divided by Wheel- house’s method, and a full-sized catheter intro- duced. Care was taken to keep the urethra fully dilated, and he was discharged well in 22 days. He has since then come to have a bougie passed occasionally. iii. Hindu male, cet. 30. Admitted with stricture and ten fistulous openings—perimeal, scrotal, penile and pubic. The stricture was tight and tortuous, and admitted with difficulty the smallest probe pointed bougie. No uriue came through the urethra. As the case was not a promising oue for gradual dilatation, Wheelhouse’s operation was performed, and a Syme’s catheter tied in. This was removed on

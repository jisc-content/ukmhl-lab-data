( 17 ) glans and body of the penis ; growth warty, tubercular or xnammillated. Organ removed about an inch from the root, corpora cavernosa divided higher than corpus spongiosum, which was stitched to the edges of a slit in a ventral flap. Bleeding stopped by catgut ligatures. Mass of cancerous lymphatic glands removed from left groin. Dressed with sulphate of iron lotion (gr. xto ^i.) This did not keep the wounds aseptic. Both suppurated and healed by granulation. The final result was satis- factory. Left hospital 37 days after operation with wounds soundly healed, patent urethra and no sign of recurrence. b.

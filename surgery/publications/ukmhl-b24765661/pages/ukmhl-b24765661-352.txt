PIIECIS OP OPERATIONS. 62 Ill 1' this series (vii) was a double one, anti though septic infection, resulting in pyaemia, may â–  occur in single operations, the chances of its t occurrence are greater in double operations, while the vital resistance is lowered by the shock of a more severe and prolonged procedure. In addition to these cases a radical operation was successfully performed for the cure of reduci- ble right inguinal hernia which was complicated by scrotal elephantiasis (see vi B. 1. xiii). Un- fortunately we have been unable to trace the subsequent history of any of these 12 persons ; but when they left hospital, the result seemed to be quite satisfactory, and none of them has since returned. They were each provided with a truss, and advised to wear it for at least a year. 5. Operation for the radical cure of ttmbilicul hernia. Mrs. M.,'European,otf.43. Five yearsago when stooping down to lift a child, she felt something give way at the navel, and a lump formed, which lias gradually increased in size. In August 1885. the swelling became tense and painful, and its contentscoulduot be reduced. They were return- ed after the employment of fomentations and purgatives. The tumour is very large, and fills whenever she stands up. The ring is very wide, admits three fingers, and is situated just above the umbilicus. The contents return into the abdominal cavity when she lies down, or with the aid of manipulation. On the 13th of February an operation was performed for the cure of the hernia. An incision was made in the middle line down to tiie sac which was carefully isolated and stitched at the neck by 4 or 5 catgut sutures.

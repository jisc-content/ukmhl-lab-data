( 38 ) the bladder and the fistula thoroughly laid open and stricture divided. Several vessels had to be tied. Secondary haemor- rhage took place ten days after the operation which was stayed by tying a bleeding point and plugging. The wound gradually contracted. A full sized instru- ment was introduced every third day. He would not have the tumour removed, and left hospital 48 days after the operation. d. Hindu male, set. 24. Had suffered from gonor- rhoea which was followed by two abscesses, one in the hypogastric region and another in front of the scro- tum at the root of the penis. An instrument passed into the urethra entered the latter and pus and blood welled out. A perinseal section was performed with- out a guide, and a soft instrument passed into and through the penile urethra from behind forwards through the wound. This was retained for a day or two, and a drainage tube was then put in its place and retained. The abscesses were at the same time laid freely open; their cavities gradually filled up, and the resulting fistulas closed. The tube was with- drawn, a full sized bougie was introduced into the bladder every third day, and finally the perinasal wound also closed up. Patient left hospital in 63 days per- fectly recovered. (e.) Mahomedan male, set. 30. Had injured his : urethra by a fall 7 years previously. Stricture re- sulted. 20 days before admission an abscess formed in the perinaeum, which burst and left a fistula through which urine escaped during micturition. No instrument could be passed through the stricture, though repeated attempts were made. Perinaeal sec- tion was performed without guide, the stricture divid- ed, and a No. 12 catheter passed into the bladder. This was repeated periodically ; the perinaeal wound gradually closed and patient left hospital after 46 days’ treatment. 6. hicisionfot hcematocele.—(a.) Hindu male, aet. 35-

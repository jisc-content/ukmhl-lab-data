( 23 ) [The method of operating adopted in these 28 cases was fully detailed in a clinical lecture published in the November number of the Indian Medical Gazette. The novelties presented by this series as compared with those previously published areâ€”(1) the new method of applying the elastic cord; (2) the digging of pockets for the reception of the testes by separating the layers of the scrotal fascia down to the pubic arch, the testes being stitched in position with catgut as previously practised, and (3) the use of boracic ointment and lint for dressing. This latter was rendered necessary in consequence of serious symptoms arising in a few cases from the absorption of carbolic acid by the large wound resulting from this operation. The success of these expedients has been marked, and although healing has not been accelerated (owing to the steps adopted to preserve the length of the penis) the process of repair has been bereft of local suffering, constitutional distress and offensive smell. In 3 of the cases (a. d. h.) the skin of the penis was preserved and remained heal- thy. Two were cases of lymph scrotum. This plan of treatment may also be adopted in cases of large hydroceles with redundant and, perhaps, slightly hypertrophied scrotal skin. In 2 cases (e. /.) the hydrocele extended along the cord into the abdomen. This was due to the tunica vaginalis being unobliter- ated inferiorly. The tunica was dissected out, and the dilated external abdominal ring closed with catgut. In one case putrefaction invaded the wound, septic suppuration ascended along the cord, and death eventually took place by septicaemia. In 2 cases (u. v.) the tumour was complicated with hernia ; these will be referred to further on. In all cases in which putrefaction was absent, repair took place more satisfactorily than when the wound became septic. Of the four deaths, two were due to septicaemia and two to tetanus. The largest tumour weighed 32 lbs. 8 oz., the

( 7 ) to strike another man. Reduced by traction with the heel in the axilla. Left hospital the same day. 2. Extension of stiff Knee-joints, a.—Maho- medan male, aet. 35. Sustained a wound of the left knee-joint 9 months ago, followed by sup- puration in the joint, formation of sinuses and permanent stiffness in a semi-flexed position. Stretched forcibly under chloroform ; several bands felt giving way ; limb placed on a Mac- Intyre splint and ice applied. Joint swelled ; strong fever supervened, lasting for two days. Lead and opium lotion applied, and a succession of blisters. Left hospital in 45 days, able to stand and walk without support, and to flex and extend the limb. b.—Hindu male, aet. 29. Right knee-joint in- flamed one year ago. Pus formed in the joint, which was laid open. Ankylosis in a semi-flexed attitude took place during the process of clo- i sure of the puncture ; leg atrophied ; patella mov- able ; constitution feeble. Forcible extension was made under chloroform, followed by the use of a MacIntyre splint. The joint inflamed. Rest and counter irritants failed to reduce the inflamma- tion, which proceeded to suppuration. The cavity became putrid and septic fever of severe type ensued. Under free opening and drainage this subsided and eventually ankylosis in a straight position was obtained. Remained 6 months under treatment. [Extension was also resorted to in Cases IV. 14.b, and vii. II. n. ii and iv.] 3. Incision of knee-joint.—Eurasian male, aet. 21.

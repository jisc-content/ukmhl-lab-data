The joint underwent simultaneous recovery. iii, iv. There were two cases of children (admitted with sinus of the leg leading to hare- bone, abscess of the thigh and diseased knee-join the abscess was opened and sinus drained. One ichild was removed before recovery was complete, the other got fever of a hectic type, and died of convulsions. v. Hindu, cet. 25. Large and deep abscess of thigh of 15 days’ duration, resulting from fever, opened antiseptically ; healed in 19 days. %* These abscesses were opened and subse- quently dressed, under irrigation, by bichloride lotion. In no case did putrefaction occur. Seve- ral of the cases illustrate the advantage of opening periosteal abscesses early ; and a few of them indicate the trouble which is apt to arise if this is uot done ;—the periosteum is destroyed, osteitis ensues, and necrosis varying iu depth according to the severity and extent of the osteitis is the consequence. This is often asso- ciated with sclerosis or the latter occurs alone.

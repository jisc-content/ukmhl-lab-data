This power may be exercised in the way of calling upon that reserve force which we possess in our body as a whole and in all our tissues or organs, or by bringing into existence remedial processes, such as vomiting, purging, inflammation or fever, or by neutralising or ex- pelling the cause of disorder, or by giving the damaged system or organ rest, or by a process of repair when structural damage has been done. In all these and other ways the natural power of recovery possessed by the body and every part of it is displayed. Without such a power our efforts to cure disease would be futile. All these efforts must be made in accordance with the ascertained laws of natural recovery, aud we cau only be said to cure disease in the sense that we place the individual in the best possible position

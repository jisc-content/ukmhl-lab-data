C 44 ; 6 days ago and could not be reduced. Bowels had not acted since descent; vomiting stercoraceous material ; hiccough setting in ; abdomen tympanitic. Temp. 9720, pulse small and frequent. Right hernia hard, tender, without impulse ; left loose. Labouring under double hydrocele. The hydrocele of the right side was tapped and emptied. Sac exposed and opened ; contained a large quantity of sanguine- ous serum and 4 inches of congested and inflamed small interim. ; stricture outside of sac freely divided. The intestine was denuded of lymph and returned. A finger was passed into the opposite sac and traction from within com- bined with taxis failed to empty the sac. The left hydrocele was also tapped and emptied. The right sac was next dissected out, tied at the neck and the stump reduced. The pillars were brought together with catgut and the wound stitched. A counter-opening was made in the scrotum and a drainage tube inserted. The operation was followed by high fever, sloughing cellulitis in the neighbourhood of the wound, and symptoms of peritonitis. These symptoms subsided in 14 days, and the wound became clean and began to granulate. The other rupture was returned by taxis 17 days after operation. A few days after a collection of matter was found in the scrotum and freely laid open. The wound healed and the patient was discharged 49 days after operation with a double truss. The canal on the right side seemed to be obliterated, and no sign of reproduction of hernia existed when he left hospital. The left hernia was fully com- manded by the truss. Full details of this impor- tant case will be found in the Indian Medical Gazette for February 1884.

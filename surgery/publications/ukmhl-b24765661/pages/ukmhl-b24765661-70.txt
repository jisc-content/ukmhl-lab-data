( 6 ) at the apex of Scarpa’s triangle ; operation performed antiseptioally ; pulsation ceased instantly and did not recur ; wound healed by first intention, and was complete- ly cicatrized on 28th May. Tension of tumour subsided, but no consolidation of contents took place. A blister formed on the most prominent part of its surface. This was succeeded by a small sphacelus which was being removed by cicatrization beneath, when on 9th July oozing of blood was detected. This became freer ; the aneurismal sac was laid open and an attempt was made to secure the vessel above and below, but welling still taking place, amputation was performed. The result of this operation is given below. The sac was found on dissection to be principally composed of the surrounding tissues, and to contain a small quantity of firm clot and a large quantity of fluid blood undergoing disorganiza- tion. The cavity was perfectly sweet, though it had been practically in contact with dead material for weeks. The slough included the wall of the aneurism at a minute point when the escape of blood had taken place. It was perfectly aseptic. The operation was successful as far as permanent occlusion of the artery was con- cerned, but this measure failed to procure consolidation of the aneurism which was very large and practically diffuse. II. 1. Reduction of dislocation of shoulder joint.— Hindu male, set. 43 ; one month’s duration ; caused by a fall. Reduced by traction under chloroform by means of pulleys; slight synovitis followed which subsided, and the resulting stiffness was remedied by passive move- ments. 2. (a.) Extension of stiff elbow.—Hindu male, set. 20 ; elbow stiff, bent at an angle of 30. Forcibly extended under chloroform, followed by frequent passive move- ment. Left hospital in 33 days greatly improved. (&.) Extension of stiff lenee.—Eurasian male, ret. 14. Bent knee consequent on a recent wound in popliteal

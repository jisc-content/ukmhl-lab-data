( 32 ) The scrotum as large as a cocoanut. The right tunica, which was thickened, was laid open freely and clots' removed. The hydrocele of the left testicle was tap- ped a few days afterwards, in order to relieve tension and prevent eaping. A swelling appeared which led to a suspicion of iliac abscess. It subsided without any unpleasant symptom. Was discharged cured after 2 months. Operation performed under chloroform. (e.) Native, aet 26. Commenced 7 years ago. No his- tory of injury. Large as a cocoanut. Laid open freely : clots removed. Tunica not excised. Is still under treatment. Profuse suppuration and sloughing. Per- formed under chloroform. Most cases of hsematocele met with in this country have been preceded by hydrocele, the tunica from injury or degeneration getting filled with blood, which is found in various stages of disintegration, and I have found it best simply to lay open freely the sac, not to excise any portion of it however degenerated. The thickened tunica acts as a sort of splint, keeping the testicle in position and preventing the occurrence of hernia testis. The tunica becomes absorbed and a satisfactory cure ensues. Antiseptic treatment by means of boracic ointment spread on gauze is of great value. 11. For Carbuncle. (a.) A European merchant, set. 73 years.

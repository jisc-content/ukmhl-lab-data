PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 4:; holes made on opposite sides and at opposite ends. The mass weighed 2^1bs., and was firm and purely fibrous; the wound which remained aseptic healed mostly by first intention. On the 15th of November the tumour of the thigh was removed in a similar maimer. The incision was 14 inches long and the mass, which also weighed 2^lbs., was found to be attached to the linen aspera. The wound was similarly dealt with, remained aseptic, and healed in 11 days, the drainage tracks closing in 19 days. He was discharged on loth December. 3. Myxoma of the nose.—Mahomedan female, out. 30. A mucous polypus removed by wire eeraseur. Discharged in 2 days. 4. Angioma of lip.— Hindu male, oet. 24. The tumour which involved the right half of the up- per lip was isolated by a clamp specially devised by Dr. McLeod for lip operations and injected in every part with saturated solution of tannin introduced by a hypodermic syringe. It swelled and on subsidence of the swelling underwent some shrinking, but the result was not satisfac- tory, and it was thought best to remove if by a V-sbnped incision. This was done 15 days after the injection. The clamp was again used with advantage on this occasion. The upper part of the wound healed by first intention, and the lower by granulation. Satisfactory union was obtained in 21 days. 5. Adenoma of mamma.—i. Hindu female, iBt. 56. Tumour of right breast about the size of a cocoanut which had been growing since she was 16 years old.

( 35 ) suffered from scurvy, but there were no signs of it now present except some ulceration of the gums. The usual operation was performed. The tunica vaginalis was found to be distended with fluid. It was emptied and part of it removed. An opening was made through the fundus of the scrotum and a drain placed in it. The patient had some febrile re- action, and the scrotum was found swollen, and ecchymosed on the day after operation. Next day the swelling had increased, the penis was cedema- tous, and it became necessary to remove the stitches which were causing tension. On the third day the scro- tum, lower abdomen and thighs were found gangre- nous, and the man was in a state of typhoid prostra- tion. He died of exhaustion in course of the afternoon. [These notes contain records of 20 cases in which the sac was exposed, the neck of it tied, the sac it- self excised, and the inguinal canal closed with cat- gut ligatures after the manner fully described in the Indian Medical Gazette, Vol. XV. pp. 227—255. In two of the cases (V. 5 a. (n) (r). supra) the hernia existed as a complication of scrotal tumour, and the operation was performed simultaneously with that of removal of the elephantoid swelling; one of these recovered notwithstanding that a large hydrocele had to be evacuated and most of the tunica removed, that castration became necessary next day, and that putrid cellulitis took place, causing extensive burrow- ing and necessitating free counter opening. The se- cond case died of septicaemia 24 days after operation. In this case the wound putrefied and parts sloughed. In five of the cases the operation was performed in addition to that of herniotomy which was demand- ed by strangulation of the hernial contents. In three of these complete recovery and radical cure resulted. Two proved fatal—one from persisting obstruction, and the other from gangrene of the herniated intes- tine. Of the 13 cases in which the operation was

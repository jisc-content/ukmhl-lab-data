( 23 ) apart to prevent their inversion and give room for the testes by means of stitches attached to tapes passed round the thighs, as recommended by Professor Partridge. In the second series including cases vii.—ix. the testes were stitched to each other and to the margins of the wound by catgut. The parts were washed with Carbo- lic lotion and the wound covered with Boracic gauze, outside of which layers of Carbolic gauze were placed instead of lint. The average weight of the tumours in these cases was 21bs. 8oz., and the average period of detention in hospital 72 days. Only one of these cases remained aseptic, but they all recovered satisfactorily. In the third series x.—xii. the operation was per- formed under strict antiseptic precautions, the parts being washed with a 1 in 20 Carbolic lotion, the Carbolic spray used throughout the operation, the testes secured as in the last series, and similar dressings applied. The average weight was lib. 15oz., and average period of detention 68 days. Two remained sweet throughout. In the third case there was secondary haemorrhage, and the wound putrefied. In the cases which remained aseptic there was an entire absence of suppuration and secondary fever. In the fourth series, in addition to the steps detailed above, rectangular flaps were cut from the side of the thighs and transplanted to cover the testes, the edges being brought together as close- ly as possible by a continuous catgut suture; this series includes cases xiii—xxv. The average weight was 21bs. 15oz., and the average period of detention 72 days. Three of these cases died—one of pleurisy and pericar- ditis 14 days after the operation, which supervened upon lymphangitis of both arms, and adenitis in both axillm. A similar sequence is mentioned in Billroth’s Surgical Pathology, 4th Ed., page 351. The wound, which remained aseptic, was in process of satisfactory repair. The second death occurred in consequence of sloughing dysentery,

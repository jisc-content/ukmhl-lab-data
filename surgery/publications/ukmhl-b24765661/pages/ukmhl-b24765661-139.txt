( 31 ) leave the out rims free. In a certain number of the cases rectangular flaps were cut from the skin of the thigh, and these were transplanted over the testes and attached to each other by continuous catgut suture (cases b to e), leaving a triangular wound on the thigh to heal by granulation. In other cases pockets were constructed for the accommodation of the testes by following the deep layer of the superficial perinseal fascia down to the arch of the pubis. The lateral flaps so formed are dragged by continuous catgut suture over the tes’es and the edges brought within an inch or so of each other in the middle line. This is the plan I invariably adopt now. By either method the testes are securely fixed in proper position, and covered either partially ar entirely by skin. When the cords are long or voluminous, as they often are in cases complicated with hydrocele or haematocele, they are simply left to form a loose mass at the root of the penis. When these various steps are completed the wound is carefully washed with al—20 carbolic lotion and dressed A strip of boracic gauze (gauze spread thinly with boracic ointment) is firsr, wound round the root of the penis in order to pre- vent its becoming imbedded. The body of the organ is then clothed with another strip Pieces of the same mate- rial are then applied to the surface of the testes. Over these are applied layers of carbolic gauze secured in position by a gauze bandage. A piece of waterproof paper envelopes the whole, and the dressings are finally secured by a bandage encircling the thighs and pubis and crossing over the perniaeum, and thus securing the close application of the borders of the dressing to the wound. The dressings are changed every day for the first fortnight or three weeks, then every second or third day according to the amount of discharge. When cases are thus treated the process of repair takes place in the following manner. The wound is filled with lymph

( 24 ) which supervened 25 days after operation, when the wound was nearly healed, and ended fatally in 7 days. The third death was caused by sloughing cellulitis which originated in the cords, and rapidly affected the flaps and neighbourhood of the wound ; death occurred in 3 days. Of the ten remaining cases one-half remained aseptic, and the other half underwent temporary putrefaction. This fact attests the great difficulty which is experienced in keeping these large wounds, which are situated close to sources of putrefaction, free from septic contamination. In these five, however, the aseptic condition was re- stored by the diligent use of iodine and boraeic acid. The five aseptic cases undoubtedly underwent repair more comfortably and rapidly than the others, and constitu- tional disburbance was slight or wanting. In one of them the complication of right oblique inguinal hernia existed. This was treated at the time of removal of the srrotal tumour by Wood's operation, which proved effective during the period of cicatrization. The hernia however descended afterwards. Of the five septic cases, one suffered from high fever and cutaneous erysipelas, another from both these complications and dysentery in addition, and a third from fever and bronchitis. On the whole the experience of the year justifies the following conclusions: â€” 1. That it is possible in a large proportion to carry out the antiseptic system thoroughly in these operations. 2. That when it succeeds there is a great saving of suffering in addition to the absence of stench. 3. That the stitching of the testes to each other, and to the surface of the wound, is a great improvement in the subsequent management of such cases, and 4. That the cutting of lateral flaps from the thighs facilitates materially the process of repair. The death-rate amounted to l5-4 per cent, of cases

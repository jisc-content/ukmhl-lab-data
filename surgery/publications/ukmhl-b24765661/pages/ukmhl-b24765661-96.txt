( 32 ) The occurrence of inflammation as indicated by the formation of pus appeared to make no difference in the result. Iti two cases the pillars were brought together by a double catgut thread in addition to the wires : one of these succeeded. The operation was performed exactly according to Professor Wood’s instructions, special care being taken to include the conjoined tendon in the inner wire and drag it outwards into contact with the outer pillar. The impression left on my mind by the experience of the year is, that the operation performed under antisep- tic precautions, while very safe, is not effective, and I have since the close of the year resolved to try another method of closing the canal and rings. 4.

( 70 ) The two deaths from secondary haemorrhage took place in deep wounds of the neck, which had undergone putrid inflammation. Secondary haemorrhage has been an exceedingly rare acci- dent in these wards since antiseptic organic liga- tures were introduced. The other death causes are special, and do not admit of general remark. 3 Hospitalism and antiseptics.â€”There has been no epidemic of septic disease of any shape in the hospital during the year. Wounds have as a rule done well, and when septic conditions arose in any case, it was due moreto circumstances connected with the individual and his wound or injury than to any contamination derived from the hospital. To prevent the occurrence of putrefaction in wounds, has now become an es- tablished object and rule in surgical practice. In some wounds and in some patients this is more difficult of accomplishment than in others, and in this country the maintenance of purity in wounds is not always an easy matter. In- creasing experience has impressed me with an increasingly thorough conviction of the great value of the antiseptic system, and the more closely I have followed the footsteps of Lister the greater comfort, success and security have I obtained. During the past year 1 have resorted to the use of boracic acid in the form of lint and ointment more largely than before, and I have found that, with some simple precautions at the time of operation and dressing, it is an efficient antiseptic, easy of application and perfectly safe. I have, however, continued to use carbolic acid in the form of spray and lotion, and in special cases have also employed carbolic gauze as an outside dressing.

Sound impinged on the surface of the stone easily, but could not enter the bladder. Stone felt with unusual distinctness in the situation of the prostate per rectum, median section made in the perinseum, a a shaped incision made in continuation on each side of the rectum. A similar incision opened the prostatic sac, and the stone was extracted by straight forceps. It was found to occupy the prostatic urethra, the bladder being empty and con- tracted, the stone weighed 4 oz. 2 drs.; recovery tedious owing to persistence of the perinseal opening. This was cauterised by a hot iron, but a small fistula remained when he was discharged 132 days after the operation. (d.) Mahomedan male, aet. 30 ; symptoms of 10 years’ duration.

( 10 ) included all. The cavity under this treatment fills up kindly with granulation material which organizes and cicatrizes. The process is necessarily protracted. Partial resections of the tarsus are not favourably viewed by some authorities. In two cases perfect repair resulted ; in the third caries re-appeared in the remaining bones. In no case, though the surrounding bone was freely divided and scraped, did any symptom of osteo-myelitis appear. TV. Amputations for injury. 1. Primary amputation of the shoulder joint.—Male Mahomedan, aff. 13. Sustained a severe laceration of right arm in the machinery of a jute mill a few hours before admission. An Esmarch’s cord was wound tightly round the shoulder and kept in position by tapes fastened on the opposite side. The remains of the arm were taken off at the shoulder joint. Anterior and posterior flaps were cut; the latter larger. Little or no blood was lost, and strict antiseptic precautions were employed. Suppuration took place and partial sloughing of posterior flap from bruising. A good stump eventually resulted. The wound healed partly by first intention and partly by granulation. There was no constitutional disturb- ance beyond the shock and reactive fever. Patient left hospital 90 days after the operation. 2. Primary amputation of the arm.—Hindu male, set. 28 ; machine accident. Sustained also lacerated wound of right leg. Arm removed before admission a few inches below shoulder joint. Flaps a good deal bruised and torn; sloughed partially, exposing of bone ; wound healed by granulation. No necrosis. Left hospital with a sound stump in 74 days. Amputation wound became septic for a time. Wound of leg remained aseptic and healed kindly and rapidly. 3. Primary amputation of the forearm.—Mahomedan male, set. 14. Bitten by a horse 5 hours before admission.

PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 24 (iii) Mithomedan male, cut. 50. This man’s left index finger was bitten by a drunkard a fortnight ago. The finger was swollen, boggy and riddled with sinuses, and the boues necrosed. It was removed together with the head of the metacarpal bone. A lot of unhealthy granula- tion material was scraped off by a sharp spoon, and the wound left to heal by granulation which occupied 29 days. %* The most remarkable features in the fore- going series of cases is the number of acci- dents requiring amputation, which were caused by machinery. A quarter of a century ago injuries of this sort were all but unknown in India. As mills and factories have arisen in and around Calcutta, machine accidents have been met with with increasing frequency, and they are likely to undergo still further increase in the near future. Two of these cases illustrate the damage caused by rough village surgery, of which very frequent examples present them- selves in the Calcutta hospitals. Amputations for Disease. 1.

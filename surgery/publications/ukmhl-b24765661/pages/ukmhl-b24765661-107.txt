( 43 ) secondary haemorrhage occurred, but this wa9 caused by vessels which escaped notice during the operation subsequently bleeding when reaction occurred. In two cases the femoral artery was tied in its continuity with catgut with the effect of permanently occluding it. In several cases the deep connections of tumours were ligatured before division and bleeding prevented at the time of operation and subsequently. The sew- ing of the testes together and their fixation by means of catgut to the surface of the perinseal wound has been an unqualified success. These organs are em- bedded in granulation material effused from their own raw surface and that of the wound, and nothing is seen of the catgut afterwards. Catgut has also been used for purposes of drainage with unfailing success. It is better than caoutchouc tubes, because there is no risk of entrance of putrid air and no need of withdrawal, the material melting away or becoming organized after it has fulfilled its function. The stitching together with catgut of the edges of the divided mucous membrane in excisions of the lower jaw is also a decided advantage, as tend- ing to prevent entry of putrid or putrescent material into the wound cavity. Of the employment of cat- gut in the radical cure of hernia I hope to write fully with extended experience in next yearâ€™s precis. P. S. D'Rozario and Co., Printers, Calcutta.

Has had a recur- rence of stone symptoms for several years. A stone was found in the bladder and removed by crushing and aspiration, the instruments being introduced thrice.

Vesical calculus removed by median litho- tomy.—Hindu male, eet. 44. Has had symptoms of stone for five years. A very stout man with an unusually deep perinasum. An attempt was first made to crush the stone, but the instrument after several trials, failed to find aud grasp it. The perinasum was then laid open on a grooved staff. The stone was very friable and broke down on grasping it, so that it became necessary to remove the fragments by scoop and injection of water. The bladder was thoroughly cleared out, and a catheter was retained for a few days. He made a good recovery in 30 days. *#* This man • had the deepest periusemn that I have ever met with. The point of my forefinger (a very long one), could just reach the neck of the bladder through the perinaeal wound; the bladder was not sacculated nor was the stone encysted. The failure to grasp the stone was probably due to the instrument not having beeu pushed far enough in. The operation was iu' reality one of median litho- tripsy.

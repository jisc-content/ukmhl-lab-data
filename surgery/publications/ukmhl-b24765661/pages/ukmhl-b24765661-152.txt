( 44 ) Wood’s principle. In one a radical cure was obtained. In another a bubonocele was discovered on subsequent examination. In this last case varicose veins of the cord were tied with catgut and a cure of a varicocele effected. In two others (cl) and (h) the sac was exposed by dissection, invaginated into the canal, held in that position by a catgut loop and the pillars, &c., brought together. In both aseptic repair took place rapidly and a radical cure was apparently accomplished. In another case (c) the neck of the sac was dissected from the cord, tied in two places and leftm situ, the pillars, &c., being secured by catgut. In this case also a satisfactory re- sult was obtained. In two cases (a) and (b) the neck of the sac was isolated, tied in two places and divided, the stump being reduced into the canal and the body of the sac left in the scrotum, the pillars, &c., being subse- quently brought together. In one case putrefaction invaded the wound, sloughing cellulitis extended into the abdominal wall, and death took place in 12 days from pyeemia. In the others a scrotal abscess formed, but a radical cure resulted. In the last case (g), the sac was dissected out in toto, the neck tied and the rest removed. In this case aseptic repair occurred and a radical cure was effected. This is the operation which I now invariably perform, and it seems to me to be the most promising. It combines—1, an assurance of obli- teration of the sac ; 2, occlusion of it at the internal ring ; 3, plugging of the canal from within ; and 4, approximation of the sides of the canal after the manner of Wood. It secures all the advantages of Wood's operation with greater precision and accuracy, inasmuch as every- thing is done under the eye ; it removes the two great disadvantages of Wood’s operation, namely uncertainty regarding the treatment and fate of the .sac and invagination of structures from without, which have a constant tendency to be pulled out; and it

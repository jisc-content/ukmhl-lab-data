PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. 41 iii. Mahomedan male, out. 15. Sustained a j • severe burn seven years ago, which caused ad- Is hesiou of the left arm to the chest wall. A thick l'1 horny cicatricial plate covered the left half of the chest. This plate was removed hy dissec--iijl’ tion, the skin connecting the arm to the chest if posteriorly divided, and one edge stitched to the chest, and the other to the arm. Flaps were taken from the neighbourhood to close up the i bo extensive raw surface left hy these dissections. In These for the most part retained their vitality |tt and position. He left hospital in 40 days with a useful and moveable limb. ij if, iv. Hindu female, cet. 36. Sustained a burn lie five months ago which has caused the formation |k of a triangular cicatricial web binding the arm j Fi and forearm in a position of acute flexion. The web was split from base to apex, and flaps were taken from the sides of the arm and forearm, and stitched together over the flexor aspect of the elbow joint. The limb was fully extended during the process of union. She left hospital in 52 days with a limb restored to usefulness and free motion. *** In all these cases the principle of opera- tion was the same—namely, to split the web transversely and convert the transverse wound into a longitudinal one by extension. The dissecting off of hard cicatricial plates and the transplanting of flaps are necessary measures in severe cases. Case iii was a very satisfactory one, and although Case i was subjected to four severe operations, the loss of skiu had been so great that the final result was uot so satisfactory as might be wished.

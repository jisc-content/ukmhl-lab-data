PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 61 47 days after operation, with the wound soundly [healed, and the hernia radically cured. x. Native Christian male, cet. 25. Con- genital hernia, right side. Sac exposed ; neck ttied, and reduced into canal. Remainder of sac dissected off and removed. Opening made in fundus of scrotum, and drainage tube inserted. Wound remained aseptic, and healed, without suppuration, in 13 days. Discharged 25 days after operation. xi. Hindu male, cet. 40. Reducible oblique right inguinal hernia of three years’ duration. Usual operation. Some bleeding took place after operation; and a thrombus formed iu the wound cavity, which suppurated freely. Repair took place by granulation.

The operation performed in these cases has been fully described in a clinical lecture which I published in this Journal (September 11882), and reproduced in my work on “ Opera- tive Surgery ” (page 202). The points which the additional experience of these cases has im- >ressed on me are: 1st. To transfix the neck of (the sac twice, at right angles, in tying it. This gives greater security to the ligature and renders fit unnecessary to tighten it so much ; 2nd. The great advantage of making an opening iu the fundus of the scrotum and inserting a drainage tube ; 3rd.

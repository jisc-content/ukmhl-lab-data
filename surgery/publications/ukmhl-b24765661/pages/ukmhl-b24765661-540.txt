8 PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. by manipulation, but on removing the long splint after 16 days the head of the femur was found to have escaped. A second reduction was effect- ed by manipulation, and after 29 days’ rest the joint was found to be in a satisfactory and serviceable state. 16. Reduction of knee-joint.—This was a case of oblique fracture of the head of the right tibia in a Hindu male, cet. 40, caused by a fall off a tree. There was well marked dislocation outwards of the tibia and fibula. This was remedied by traction with pullies, and the limb was kept on a Maointyre splint for a month. The result was satisfactory. Ic. Reduction of dislocation of elbow-joinf. —i. European male, cet. 33. Backward dislo- cation of radius caused by a fall off a phsetonj Reduced under chloroform by forcible flexion. Good result in 36 days. ii. Hindu male, cet. 18. Backward disloca- tion of both bones of six weeks’ standing. Limb (right) nearly straight. Reduction was effected under chloroform, and by subsequent manipula- tion a useful joint, was obtained. He remained 42 days in hospital. iii. H indu male, cet. 22. Backward disloca- tion of both bones of right elbow-joint with fracture of the head of the radius caused by fall off horse back. The limb was.nearly straight. By forcible flexion under chloroform partial reduc- tion was effected. Subsequent manipulation was repeatedly resorted to, but mobility could not be permanently restored and excision of the joint became necessary (see case III, 6, iv infra.)

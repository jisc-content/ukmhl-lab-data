Bowels completely obstructed for 28 hours, vomited several times, abdomen tym- panitic and tender, dilated coils visible, very restless and anxious, clammy sweats, pulse small and soft. The belly was opened, and- intestines, which were much distended and congested, were systematically examined from end to end, but no cause of obstruction found. Patient died of shock 10^ hours after the operation. On post- mortem examination, the intestines were found to be congested, but no cause of obstruction could be discovered, except a baud of mesentery crossing a loop of small intestine in the right iliac fossa.

X.—Reparative operations. 1, Rhinoplastic operation. — Mahomedau female, cet. 30. The tip alee and columna of the nose were cut off by her husband aud a wound inflicted on the upper lip dividing it completely. A new nose was brought down from the forehead by Surgeon Gr. Jameson and carefully stitched to the stump. It adhered by first intention aud the pedicle was divided 14 days after the oper- ation. She was discharged in 29 days with a fairly good substitute for the lost feature. 2. Plastic operation of the face.—This oper- ation was rendered necessary by a gap at the root of the nose remaining after removal of a can- cerous upper jaw (see VII, i (c) i). A flap was taken from the cheek to fill it up, aud the object was satisfactorily accomplished.

PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. 83 cicatricial webs — one stretching between the arm and chest, and the other between the arm and forearm ; the webs were divided and flaps transplanted from the extensor to cover the flexor aspects of the joint. The case did well, and patient left hospital 93 days after operation with a useful limb. Cases of cicatricial contraction after burn are very common in Calcutta. They usually present a tight web stretching across the flexor i aspect of one or more joints and holding these in a position of acute flexion, thus seriously im- j pairing the use of the extremity. The principles of treatment employed in these cases are: ls£. To divide the cicatricial tissue thorough- ly and transversely; avoiding, of course, by ; careful dissection, division of important struc- I tures. j 2nd. To dissect off any hard keloid cicatrix, ■ which is likely to impede repair, i 3i'd. To convert the transverse wound into a l longitudinal wound. i 4th. To dissect off flaps from the sides and i back of the limb to enable the edges of the ) longitudinal wound to come together and provide t a covering of skin on the flexor aspect of the ) joint. » 5th.

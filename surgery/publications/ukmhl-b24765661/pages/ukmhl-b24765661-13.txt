This method of practising by and in obedience to formulae saves a great deal of trouble, and presents a semblance of scientific accuracy and method. Given the disease, fiud the drug that fulfils the formulated indication and success is assured. But the questions arise —Can the phenomena of life and disease be in- cluded in a principle or expression or formula of this sort ? Is such a formula, if true at all, universally so ? Are the phenomena of disease and drug action so definite and uuiform that they cau be brought under the sway of fixed rules of this kind ? I am inclined, for reasons which I shall presently state, to answer these questions in the negative ; and, in addition, it is necessary to inquire-—How have these formula been arrived at ? Have they been reached by scientific methods? Are they capable of being scientifically tested and proved ? And, do they depend on objective or subjective evidence— the evidence of the senses aid by instruments of precision or of the imagination? You will find on examining these formulae that they do not satisfy these requirements, that they are the products of fancy, rather than the outcome of scientific research, and that they represent par- tial truths and superficial analogies rather than deductions from scientific observation and ex- periment. I do not therefore advise you to pin your faith on formula}. They are mostly delusive

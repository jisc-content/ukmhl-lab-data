( 42 ) g. Abscess of arm.—Native female, get. 28. Ab- scess in infra spinous fossa of right side of 4 days’ duration. Opened and drained antiseptically. An- other abscess detected at the upper part of right arm 6 days afterwards, and similarly treated. Erysipelas of the shoulder and arm supervened on the last oper- ation. This delayed the closing of the sinuses, which continued to suppurate freely as long as the erysipelas lasted. Satisfactory closing of both was obtained after 68 days’ treatment. h. Multiple abscesses.—(a.) Eurasian female, set. 29. Had suffered before admission from 6 abscesses in the breast, axilla, and other places. After admis- sion four additional abscesses formed; they were opened and drained antiseptically. Tonic treatment was adopted, and she was discharged in good health after 92 days’ treatment. (b.) East Indian male, set. 31. Admitted with a large abscess of left thigh of 1 7 days’ duration, which followed over-fatigue and formed with fever. An abscess at the back of the right thigh was subse- quently detected, and then an abscess of the liver. They were opened and drained antiseptically on the 20th, 22nd and 26th June. The tubes were gradu- ally shortened and finally withdrawn on 27th June (right thigh), 30th June (left thigh), and 17th July (liver). The wounds healed up soon after, and he was discharged on 21st July,—32 days after ad- mission. X. 1. Division of cicatrix after burn.—Hindu male, set. 7.

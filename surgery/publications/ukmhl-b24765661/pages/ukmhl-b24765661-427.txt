PRECIS OF OPERATIONS 1 PERFORMED IN THE WARDS OF THE FIRST SURGEON, MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL, During the year 18SS. By Brigade-Surgeon K. McLEOD, A.M., M.D., F.R.C.S.E., Professor of Surgery, Calcutta Medical College. The following tabular statement and notes are drawn up on precisely the same plan as the seven similar papers which have been published in this journal. The value of these commu- nications is mainly cumulative and statistical, but a good deal of valuable clinical experience will be found here and there to which special attention is drawn. The summaries are pre- pared from careful notes taken by Assistant- Surgeon Akshoy Krishna Shaha, L. M. S., to whom I am greatly indebted for this service, as well as for the intelligent assistance he has given me both in the operating theatre and the wards. Table of Operations performed during 1888.

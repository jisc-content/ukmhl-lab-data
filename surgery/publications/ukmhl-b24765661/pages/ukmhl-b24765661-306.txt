PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. 16 *** The expedient adopted in this case in orde to procure union of the pointed fragments t the ulna is worthy of notice. The points wer snipped off by bone-forceps, and, having bee I placed behind the freshened ends of the broke! I shaft, were left in the wound. The object waste leave as much material as possible for the forma tion of new bone in the wound. For this purpose it is necessary : (a) to preserve the soft tissue con nections of the separated fragments as much a possible; and (b) to keep the wound aseptic The result was not perfect, but was probabl; more so than if the pieces had been removed The same expedient was employed in a simila Ciise in 1885 with partial success.

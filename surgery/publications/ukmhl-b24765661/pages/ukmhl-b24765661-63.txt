( 35 ) 3. Hindu male, set. 30. Right thumb smashed ; slough- ed off ; tetanus supervened on 13th day. Median nerve stretched on 18th day. No benefit. Died on 24th day after injury, 9 days after tetanus, and 6 days after nerve stretching. General Remarks. The death rate of the cases included in the foregoing table, &c., amounts to 18'5 per cent. This rate is com- parable only with a table constructed on the same princi- ples and including the same description of cases. It might be raised slightly by adding two or three cases which were removed from the hospital in a precarious condition, or lowered a little by removing cases where the fatal event did not result from the operation per- formed, such as the fatal cases of tracheotomy, the case of nerve-stretching for tetanus, &c. A general death rate in surgical operations is an extremely loose and uncer- tain figure. The rate now given will be useful for comparison with future rates calculated on the same principles and by the same method. The figures relating to particular operations together with the descriptions are of more value for purposes of general comparison, and this value will increase as the induction is widened from year to year. It will be observed that several of the fatal events were due to erysipelas and septic disease. 10 cases of erysipelas occurred in these wards during the year, and four of these proved fatal. Not one of the cases treated under the strict antiseptic system contracted the disease, though they occupied the same wards at the time the disease was prevailing. Five of the cases occurred in patients from whom scrotal and labial tumours had been removed. These patients remain for weeks under treat- ment with granulating wounds which from their situation cannot be kept quite pure. Efforts were made to segre- gate and isolate the affected patients as much as possible.

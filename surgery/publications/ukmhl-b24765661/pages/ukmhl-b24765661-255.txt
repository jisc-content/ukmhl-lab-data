(them in position. They were generally changed every day for the first fortnight, then every second )■ ^ or third day according to the amount of discharge; the spray was used during operation or change of dressing. In the great majority of cases,— when not otherwise stated—the wound remain- ed aseptic and did not suppurate. This is a i great comfort to the patient and dresser. It i contributes also to the salubrity of the ward, t Great care was taken to keep the penis isolated i and prevent its retraction during cicatrization. 1 When it was necessary adhesions at its root j were freely disrupted or divided by finger or scissors. This process of maintaining the isola- i tion of the penis greatly retards final recovery, but it procures a much more natural and useful state of parts. The scrotal wound, in aseptic cases, generally heals in a fortnight or three weeks ; the rest of the time is consumed in cicatrization of the penis. In six cases (Nos. x, xii, xiii, xviii, xix, xx,) the scrotum only was removed, the penis being left untouched. In one case (No. xxii) the skin of the penis only was removed. It was a case of recurrence after a former amputation of the scrotum only. In many cases the tumour was complicated with hydrocele, and in a few with haematocele. The lightest tumour weighed 8 oz. and the heaviest 6 lbs. 8 oz., the average being 2 lbs. 2% oz.' The mean period of detention in hospital was (excluding fatal cases) 6g days. The three cases which were complicated with hernia will be subsequently referred to. The death-rate was high—25 per cent. In three cases the cause was tetanus, and in three septic poisoning, associated with putrefaction and gangrene.]

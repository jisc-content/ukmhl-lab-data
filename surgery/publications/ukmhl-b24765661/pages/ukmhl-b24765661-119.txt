( 11 ) which were in a state of suppurative inflam- mation and so minimising the profuse discharge which was giving rise to a rapidly exhausting hectic. The anterior flap of the resection wound was retained as the anterior flap of the amputation ; the patella remov- ed, the posterior flap cut by oblique incision through the popliteal space and the femur divided above the condyles. The cavity of the resection wound was thus taken away. An abscess cavity running up the thigh, into which a counter-opening had been made below the trochanter remained. The man was in a state of miserable debility, but bore the operation well. Very little blood was lost. He seemed at first to rally. No attempt at repair took place; discharge continued profuse; wasting and exhaustion progressive, and ha died 8 days after operation. The wound did not undergo putrefaction after either operation, and the suppurative melting away of the tissues seemed to be the result of sheer constitutional asthenia. 8. Amputation of the leg for mycetoma of foot.â€”Hindu male set. 34. Sustained an injury of the sole of left foot about a year before admission. A month after a few pimples appeared near the wound which suppurated and burst; successive crops of fresh pimples appeared, the foot and ankle meantime growing bulky. On admission foot, ankle and lower third of leg found brawny and covered with button-like tubercles through which a probe entered and passed deeply into the member. No bare bone could be felt. White granular material like hilsa row could be spooned out of the sinuses. Amputation of leg at junction of middle and lower third performed bloodlessly and antiseptically by long anterior and short posterior flaps. Catgut drain used : wound remained aseptic and healed by first intention. Drain fell off on 7th day ; wire sutures removed on 5th and horse hair on 11th day. Wound soundly healed in 15 days. Left hospital

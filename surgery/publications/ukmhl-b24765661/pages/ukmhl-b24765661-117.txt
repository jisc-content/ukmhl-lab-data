( 9 ) under strict antiseptic precautions. There was consider- able reaction and temperature continued high (100 to 102°), wound remained aseptic, and no local inflam- mation or suppuration arose. Symptoms of tetanus appeared 7 days after operation, the disease assumed a very acute type and proved fatal in 24 hours. 3. Secondary amputation of the forearm for gangrene.— Hindu male set 30. Left forearm crushed in a sugar mill 11 days before admission. Both bones broken; tissues on anterior aspect of forearm gangrenous. Temp. 103°, pulse feeble ; patient restless and delirious. Gangrenous tissues removed at line of demarcation with scissors. Oval flap cut from sound tissues on dorsum; bones divided 2 inches below elbow ; vessels secured with cat- gut. Tissues in a state of inflammatory infiltration; great tendency to oozing which was checked by cat- gut ligatures. Wound washed with chloride of zinc (40 gr. to 3i ) and dressed antiseptically Secondary haemorrhage occurred on two occasions in consequence of patient’s restlessness. He became low and sank 15 hours after the operation. 4. Secondary amputation of thigh for compound fracture and haemorrhage from eroded popliteal artery.—Hindu male aet. 43, admitted 29th November with compound comminuted fracture of left femur above the condyles ; wound was in course of repair when, on 31st December, free arterial haemorrhage occurred. This was controlled by graduated compress, but was repeated on three sub- sequent occasions, greatly reducing patient's strength. It became evident that the blood proceeded from the main artery, and amputation was resorted to as the only means of saving life ; the bleeding point being very deep and the prospect of gangrene certain if the main artery of the limb were ligated. The amputa- tion was performed by Carden’s method bloodlessly and antiseptically. The stump became gangrenous

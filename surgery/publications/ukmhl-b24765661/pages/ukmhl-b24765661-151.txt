( 43 ) the removal of the tumour, the sac of the hernia was ligatured at the neck, the fundus amputated and the pillars and sides of the canal brought together by strong catgut sutures. In one castration was performed on the same side in consequence of accidental wound of the spermatic artery. One of these cases died of septicae- mia due to putrefaction of the external wound ; the peritoneum was found healthy and neck of the sac in process of obliteration on post-mortem examination. In the second case a satisfactory radical cure was obtained. Two were cases of herniotomy for strangulation. [VII. 2. a (a.) and &.] in one of which a large mass of omentum was removed after ligature in sections, the sac dissected off the cord, neck tied and the pillars, &c., brought together. The hernia had been down for 58 hours, patient was in a state of collapse, and died in 8 hours of shock and exhaustion. In the other after reduc- tion of the hernia without opening the sac, this was in- vaginated and held in the canal by a catgut loop passed through the abdominal wall; the pillars, &c., being brought together by 3 strong catgut loops. Suppuration occurred in the scrotum requiring free counter-opening ; the sac came away in the form of a slough through this opening, and the patient made a good recovery with radical cure of his hernia. In two cases [VII. 3. a (a) and (5) Wood’s wire oper- ation was performed with apparent radical cure in one instance and benefit in the other ; the canal being con- tracted and a truss rendered more effective. In the remaining 8 cases more direct measures were resorted to wittx a view to obliteration of the sac cavity and approximation of the canal walls. In two cases of this series (b) and (ej—after expos- ing the cord by direct dissection, dividing its coverings and examining the canal no sac could be found, the pillars were brought together by catgut ligatures on

( 26 ) three occasions, on 3rd, 10th, and 14th of March ; suffered from a smart attack of fever after the first operation ; very little vesical irritation. Remained 44 days in hospital. VIII. Removal of foreign body from nose.—Hindu male, set. 5. Had introduced a piece of sola or pith into the right nostril five months ago. Inflam- mation and swelling ensued, the nostril was plugged, and there was a constant discharge of pus and blood from it. The mass had swelled and become firmly impacted. It was removed partly by a director sweeping the cavity from above downwards, and partly by forceps. Some epistaxis ensued, but not of sufficient consequence to necessitate plugging. The boy left hospital in a few days. 2. Removal of foreign body from the urethra. —Hindu male, set. 32. Had suffered from chan- cre 16 years ago. The ulcer was behind the corona glandis interiorly, and left a cartilaginous induration which caused great contraction of the urethra in this position. He subsequently contracted gonor- rhoea which was followed by gleet and stricture in the membranous part of the urethra. On the day preceding his admission he had retention for which a medical practitioner tried to pass a No. 4 catheter. It was forced through the anterior structure with great difficulty, and a false passage was made into the erectile substance of the penis immediately behind the stricture. Failing to reach the bladder, the operator tried to withdraw the instrument, and in doing so, broke it at the junction of the shaft and curve. The latter remained behind and could be felt on handling the penis. The stricture was divided by urethrotomy and the fragment removed by forceps ; the posterior stricture was subsequently dilated by bougies ; slight bleeding persisted for 24 hours and then ceased. Urine was passed in good stream,

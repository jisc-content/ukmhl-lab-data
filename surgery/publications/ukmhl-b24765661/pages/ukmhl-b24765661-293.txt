3 PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 1 0 Total incurs, abscess, haemorrhage, aneurism), while amputation—a method of operating—still holds a prominent place in the scheme. The fact is, that any classification rigidly carried out on any of the three principles will drag likes apart, and,perhaps, the anatomical plan does this to a greater extent than either of the other two. It follows from what I have written, that the new classification is very far from per- fect, and, inasmuch as it is more bulky aud ela- borate, it is not so convenient as the old. For this reason, aud for the sake of uniformity and facility of comparison, I have determined to ad- here to the plan of classification adopted in pre- vious papers. Indeed, as long as the terras des- criptive of operations express the three ideas I have specified, it does not matter much what classification is used, because the items can be redistributed according to fancy or need at any future time. With these preliminary remarks, I present a tabular statement of the operations performed during the calendar year 1886. In future numbers, I hope to give a short accouut of each of the more important cases: — Table of Operations performed during 1886. Description of Operation. Number. Died. I.

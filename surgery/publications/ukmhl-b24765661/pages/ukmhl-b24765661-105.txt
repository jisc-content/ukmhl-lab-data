( 41 ) Wound healed in 12 days. Thickening of skin gra- dually disappeared ; sensation restored to a slight extent. 3. Nerve-stretching.—Hindu female, ret. 40. Anaes- thetic leprosy of 6 or 7 years’ duration ; right leg and foot affected ; gangrenous ulcers on toes. Sciatic nerve stretched. Wound healed in a week. Ulcers healed and sensation restored to a slight extent. In two of the cases where splitting of the thickened nerve was the main feature of the operation, decided relief was obtained. In the case of nerve-stretching the disease had advanced too far to leave ground for much hope. General Remarks. 1. Mortality.—The death-rate in 1880 amounted to 10‘7 per cent, against 18*5 in 1879. On comparing the tables from which these rates are deduced, it will be found that the operations of 1880 were by no means lighter in character than those of 1879. Indeed the numbers of the more important and serious cases are wonderfully alike. Whether the improved death- rate is a mere variation—a result of what may be briefly and expressively called luck,—or depends on an improvement in the management of cases, future returns will show. I am inclined provisionally, and subject to correction by wider experience, to believe that the more assiduous and scrupulous use of antiseptics has contributed materially to the result. 2. Antiseptics.—These have been more largely and carefully employed—used more strictly in cases to which they are easily applicable, and extended to others where success is not so easily attained. Rigid Listerism has been adopted whenever possible; and in cases such as operations about the mouth or anus, where putrefaction could not be excluded, agents such as chloride of zinc, iodine, permanganate of potash and boracic acid, have been freely used with a view to

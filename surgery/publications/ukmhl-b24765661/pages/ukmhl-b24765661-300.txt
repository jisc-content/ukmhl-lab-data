10 PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. of 30 feet. The wound measured tlirpe inclie and had been stitolled but not drained. H suffered from fever. A drainage tube wa inserted on his admission and an effort, made t< render the wound aseptic. Eight days afte> admission the discharge was found to hegancrreJ nous, and wound sloughy ; humerus extensively denuded; patient delirious ; temperature 103Â°: ' tongue dry. Resection was performed under! antiseptic precautions as a forlorn hope. Thi> I did not stay the progress of septic infection ; secondary abscesses appeared in the forearm. 1 left iliac fossa, and over left tibia; the lattei-i two baring the bone extensively. A bedsore formed, which took on a sloughing character, and laid bare the sacrum and iliac bones. It finally communicated with the iliac abscess1 and bladder. For a few days before his death patient passed all llis urine through the bedsore. He died of exhaustion from pyaemia 21 days after the operation. A post-mortem examina- tion was not permitted. *%* Had this wound been Listerised and drained at the commencement, the issue would 1 probably have been different. Attempts to render it aseptic after admission failed and septic periostitis set in. Amputation was recoin- ! mended but declined, and resection was con- seated to after considerable persuasion. It was too late. Pyaemia, already established, pursued a swift and virulent course. It is curious to note that the secondary lesions affected the same tissue, periosteum, as the primary. Mic- turition thiough the bedsore was a rare and sad incident of the close of the case.

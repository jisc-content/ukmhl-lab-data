Antiseptic measures were invariably employed, in some cases preventively when the skin remained whole, but in most cases correctively when sinuses led to the cavitv containing the dead or carious hone. Several of the cases were due to injury recent or remote; and in some of the latter constitutional condi- tions accentuated or perpetuated the mischief caused by the noxa. Some were the result of broken-down gummata, strumous or syphilitic. But in many cases the bone death was due to acute inflammatory processes untreated or ag- gravated by maltreatment and unrest. In one such case neglected abscess of the scalp in a Hindu lad of 19 led to extensive necrosis of tbe skull. Notwithstanding free opening and removal of loose fragments of dead bone, para- lysis and epileptiform fits supervened, and the patient was removed in a moribund state. In another case acute abscess of tbe cheek causing alveolar necrosis was due to the eruption of a wisdom tooth in a lad of 18. Cases of atresia oris caused by inflammatory changes in the soft parts set up by tbe lower wisdom teeth in pro- cess of eruption are not uncommon in India. Extraction of tbe widsom tooth or of tlie second molar is generally necessarj', and division of the cicatricial band with subsequent use of the screw-gag. The great majority of tbe cases responded satisfactorily to t he measures employ- ed, but in some cases very slowly ; while in others repeated operations were necessary. In all cases constitutional remedies were resorted to when they appeared to be advisable or necessary. 2. Wiring fractured patella. â€” Muhoinedau

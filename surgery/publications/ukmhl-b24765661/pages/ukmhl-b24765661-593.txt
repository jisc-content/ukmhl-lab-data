PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. 61 The hamstring tendons which were very tense, were divided subcutaneously, and the joint straightened. The limb continued weak and useless, and wiring of the broken patella was done seven days later with good success (see IV, 2). 7b. Tenotomy for talipes equinus—European female, cut. 30. Suffered from fever seven years previously which caused contraction of the muscles of the calf. The Tendo Achillis was divided subcutaneously on both sides, and the deformity was completely remedied. 7 c.

Incision for contracted orifice of meatus urinarius.—i. Mahomedan male child, aged 10 months. The glans penis was congenitally cleft interiorly, and the urethra opened by a very small orifice, through which urine came in drops, in this cleft.

A band crossed the roof of the urethra which impeded

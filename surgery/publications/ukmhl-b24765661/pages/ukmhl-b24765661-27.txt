It would be unjust to the public, official and non-official, to deprive them of the special skill in medicine, surgery, midwifery, and ophthalmology obtained by study and hos- pital practice by the professors of these sub- jects ; but in India, as elsewhere, the distractions of general practice are inconsistent with that exclusive or predominant devotion to the work of teaching, which the vast extent and rapid growth of medical service 'now demand. Our contention is, in short, that the professors of medical colleges should be relieved of presi- dency surgeons’ duties, and prohibited from en- gaging in general or family practice. Their services should be available to the public, offi- cial and non-official, in consultation as that term is understood in England—without fee of course iu the case of Government officers,—and they should be permitted to undertake professional work, such as referee for insurance companies, university examiner, editor or correspondent of a medical journal, &c., &c., which could be per- formed during the hours of leisure to which every man is entitled. An arrangement of this sort would necessitate a considerable in- crease in the present scale of salaries, which was drawn up when the value of the rupee was considerably higher than it is, and the expenses of living considerably lower, and on the assump- tion that the permission to engage in general practice was of itself a substantial addition to the. official pay. It would also necessitate a revision iu part or in whole to the old system of separate presidency surgeons. This would undoubtedly add to the cost of medical services ;

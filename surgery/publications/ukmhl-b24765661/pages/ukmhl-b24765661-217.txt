( 47 ) course. In the cases of septic poisoning, the disease was associated with putrid wounds and presented a chronic type, being of slow development and associat- ed with local inflammations of a low kind. The remaining causes do not give ground of general com- ment. 3. Hospitalism and Antiseptics.—The behaviour of wounds was satisfactory during the year under re- port, erysipelas almost unknown, and unhealthy in- flammation rare. Extended experience induces me to attach greater importance to the element of con- stitutional depravity or impaired vital resistance, as largely determining both the occurrence and type of septic disturbance both of wounds and system. This consideration furnishes strong ground for the sedu- lous employment of antiseptics. The argument would take this form. If the strong and healthy are liable to be poisoned by material absorbed from putrid wounds, and require for safety the employment of measures competent to prevent putrefaction, how much more necessary are these in the case of the feeble and unhealthy, whose tissues become an easier prey to infection and systems succumb more readily to the toxic effects of septic poisons absorbed from putrid wounds. I have accordingly spared no pains to prevent the occurrence of putrefaction in wounds. The only change which I have made in this respect has been greater caution in applying carbolic dressings direct to wounds, for in several cases I have observed un- pleasant symptoms arise from absorption of carbolic acid through the wound and skin. I have therefore used boracic acid in the form of the boracic lint, and the ointment (Lister’s) spread on thin gauze more largely as a direct application to wounds and sores, reserving carbolic gauze for use as an outer covering. As such it maintains a pure atmosphere in the vicinity of the wound, and maintains aseptic any discharges that may escape beyond the deeper layers of the dressings’

32 PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. along the anterior borders of the sterno-mastoids as far as the episternal notch where they met. i The lower jaw was divided at the angles, and j the whole of the tissues included in the inci- sion removed down to the surface of the larynx. Both submaxillary and sublingual glands were taken away, and the body of the hyoid bone, which was eroded, removed. The operation was of a very formidable character, and some 60 vessels had to be ligatured. The edges of what remained of the lower lip were brought toge- ther. Laryngotomy was found to be necessary owing to the falling back of the tongue and epiglottis. The wound was sprinkled with iodoform, and dressed with boraoic gauze. Patient was fed at first per rectum, and then by a funnel and tube passed into the oesophagus. The parts gradually healed. The lower lip adhered, and the wound on the front of the neck underwent granulation, cicatrization and contraction. Patient was taught to feed him- self, and improved greatly in general health, He continued to wear the tracheal tube ; bui was able to walk about the hospital grounds. About two months after the operation, infiltra- tion of the skin was observed at a little did- I tance from the wound on either side. These lumps have extended and ulcerated, and are now rugged sloughy open sores set on a deep, hard, extensive base exactly resembling that which existed on his chin when lie was admitted. He is emaciating, and the end is not I far off. (Died 31st May). q.—Epithelioma of the neck (recurrent). — Patient had undergone an operation for cancer |

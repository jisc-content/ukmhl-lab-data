Antiseptics and hospitalism.—The antiseptic system has been practised as strictly and sedulously as possible during the year. Difficulties are encountered in an Indian hospital which tend to detract from the success of antiseptic surgery. The appliances are not so per- fect as in an English hospital ; the patients very rarely give intelligent assistance, and often defeat the sur- geon’s best efforts by incautious movements, pulling off and soiling dressings, &c., and the assistants are often unreliable—careless, hurried, superficial or dishonest. Still by persevering personal attention success can be secured in most instances, and there is nothing in the climate to render such success unattainable or even arduous, if only the system is thoroughly understood and conscientiously applied. The end in view, repair of injury by physiological process without the interven- tion of pathological or septic disturbance, can be attained in suitable cases just as well in India as in Europe, though perhaps for the reasons stated not so easily. It may be useful to examine the death causes above specified in detail with a view to discover how far they are due to the absence or failure of antiseptics. As regards the general behaviour of wounds the experi- ence of the year was favourable. No erysipelas, sloughing cellulitis or similar.wound disturbance prevailed. In none of the cases of shock could septic poisoning bo said to predispose or hasten the fatal event. In two cases the severity of the operation was solely responsible ; in one impaired health from long standing sinuses, in one previous haemorrhage, and in another strangulation of a hernia were undoubtedly predisposing causes. Of the 4 cases of tetanus, the disease arose in three

The method or the formula may contain a germ of truth ; as long as it is used for the presumed benefit of the patient rather than of the practitioner, so long may we honor the motive while we regret and condemn the narrow or mistaken doctrine. Depend upon it the more enlarged and philo- sophical our conception of our duties and res- ponsibilities—the higher our aims and wider our grasp—the happier will our life be and more productive our methods. The profession of medicine is to its earnest votaries a source of endless interest and pleasure, and if 1 have suc- ceeded by the words which I have now spoken in impressing upon you a loftier and truer notion of its scope and dignity and responsibility, I feel assured that I have bestowed upon you something far transcending; in value material riches, namely, that which will render your fu- ture lives more fruitful and enjoyable. In taking leave of you and of this college, I cannot offer you a better wish than that you should reap from the study and practice of rational medi- cine all the pleasure and profit which, when pro- perly and unselfishly cultivated and applied, it is so singularly and eminently capable of con- ferring.

( 39 ) Admitted with a very tense and painful swelling of left side of scrotum which had been mistaken for a strangulated hernia. Constipation had existed for S days, patient had vomited, and was in a state of prostration. On tapping the swelling very foetid fluid of a yellow color was emitted. The cord was exposed in the groin. It was oedematous, but no sign of any hernial sac could be seen. The scrotal swelling was then laid open by free incision, and a large quantity of putrid clot and grumous liquid re- moved. It was dressed for granulation. Consider- able constitutional disturbance remained for a day or two, but gradually subsided; both wounds healed by granulation. An abscess formed on the right side of the scrotum which was laid open. Eventually an excellent recovery took place in 32 days ; the wounds having cicatrized, the scrotum resumed its natural size. (b.) Hindu male, set. 24. Suffered from hernia of the right side which was tapped a year ago. Re- accumulation taking place, it was again tapped 4 days before admission. The fluid was observed to be sanguineous, and a solution of carbolic acid was injected. Great pain and swelling and constitutional disturbance followed. On exploring the tunica it was found to be tensely filled with bloody putrid material. It was laid open freely and emptied and dressed with boracic gauze. The wound gradually filled up, and patient left hospital in 48 days with a linear cicatrix on a scrotum of normal size. He had an attack of surgical scarlatina during convalescence. (c.) Hindu male, set. 40. Suffered from hydrocele of left tunica and periodical fever. It was tapped and injected with iodine two months before admis- sion. This was followed by inflammation and swell- ing. The latter continued to increase. The tunica was freely laid open and a large quantity of sanguin- eous fluid and lymphy clot evacuated. The wound healed by granulation in 55 days, the cavity of the tunica undergoing complete obliteration.

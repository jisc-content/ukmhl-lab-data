( 55 ) e. East Indian male, set. 27. Distended tunica of 2 years’ duration, was tapped and injected with iodine one month ago. Laid open by a small incision and a tube inserted. Wound healed by granulation. Was suffering from secondary syphilis, which detained him in hospital 58 days. [Case b is a very remarkable one. The cavity consisted of a combined tunica and processus. Hydrocles of this sort are not uncommon in India. The result of incision was the develop- ment of septicaemia of exceedingly severe type. I have another case of the kind in hospital at present (March 1884), in which suppuration had taken place prior to admission. The sac was greatly thickened. A small opening was made under the spray just sufficient to admit a drain- age tube. The discharge has remained sweet and the sac is rapidly contracting. No constitu- tional disturbance occurred in this case. I be- lieve that unless the sac can be drained antiseptically (which is not an easy matter) the best plan istomake avery free opening and stuff the cavity with antiseptic substances such as boracic lint. Even this practice is not devoid of danger as Case d. proves.] 10. Imperforate anus.—a. Male child, 5 days old.

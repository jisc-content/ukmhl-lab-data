( 69 ) 2 Death causes.—These may be displayed as follows :— Septicaemia ... ••• 10 Tetanus ... .. ••• 6 Asthenia and exhaustion ... 5 Shock .. ... ... 3 Pneumonia ... ••• 3 Secondary haemorrhage ... 2 Dysentery ... ... i Chloroform asphyxia ... ... i Diphtheria ... ... I Obstruction of bowels ... i Peritonitis ... ... i 34 In the fatal cases of septic poisoning a putrid or gangrenous state of the wound existed, and a reference to the detailed cases will show that this occurred under circumstances in which its prevention was difficult or impossible. The number of deaths caused by tetanus is large, and most of them arose in connection with scrotal operations. In one case the disease was associated with spreading traumatic gangrene. I have seen other instances of this combination, and the fatal issue is exceedingly swift. In the cases of exhaustion, constitutional exhaus- tion, the shock of injury and septic poisoning were so associated as to render a more precise term inaccurate. In the cases of death by shock the result was partly due to the feeble constitution of the subject and partly to the severity of the operation. In the fatal cases of pneumonia and dysentery these diseases de- veloped after operation, and were probably the result of chill acting on a susceptible system

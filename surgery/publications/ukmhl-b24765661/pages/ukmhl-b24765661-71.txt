Numerous abscesses of right leg ; knee-joint inflamed and became filled with pus.

The wound putrefied; patient suffered from diarrhoea; but rallied and was progressing favourably when acute peritonitis set in and killed him in three days. He survived the operation 28 days. The humerus was found stripped to the extent of an inch and its medulla inflamed. (b.) Resection of hip-joint.—A Hindu child, aet. 2 years, admitted 11th August 1879 ; sustained a fall two months before admission.

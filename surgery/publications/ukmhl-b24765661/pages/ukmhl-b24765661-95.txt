( 31 ) tion and peritonitis observed next day. These in- creasing, the wound was re-opened on third day. During operation and while slightly under chloroform patient vomited and died suddenly on the table of asphyxia. A portion of the sac had remained in the scrotum and a loop of intestine had been forced into it by the constant coughing which had become strangulated. (j.) Mahomedan male, set. 70. Left oblique inguinal hernia, of 3 years’ duration ; ring very large ; con- stant descents ; operation performed antiseptically ; wire removed in 21 days. Left hospital in 44 days. No descent of hernia. (h.) American male, aet. 40. Left oblique inguinal hernia ; 7 years’ duration ; ring admitted two fingers. Operation performed antiseptically ; wound suppu- rated ; wire removed after 11 days. Wound healed in 37 days. Hernia descended two days after. Discharg- ed in 57 days wearing a truss. 13 operations for the radical cure of hernia, according to Professor Wood's plan, were performed in 1880. The result was on the whole disappointing. In only one case did putrefaction occur, and in none except the fatal case (£,) in which the circumstances were very unfavourable, did any constitutional or local disturbance of consequence arise. Only 3 of the thirteen operations succeeded in preventing subsequent descent of the hernia. The ring was contracted in all the cases, and considerable effusion took place, but in the majority, on absorption of this effusion, the hernia descended. The truss was more effective in preventing descent in these cases than it had been. In one case the operation was repeated without avail. In another case with double hernia two operations were performed on one side and one on the other : they all failed. In the majority the wires were removed in from 9 to 12 days. In one case they were retained for 15 days without effect, in another successful case for 21 days.

( 33 ) ed with hypertrophy of the scrotal integument, the skin of the penis remains healthy. These were treated by liberal removal of the redundant and thickened scrotum 'â– > isolation of the testes, removal of superfluous tunica> stitching of the testes together and of the remains of the scrotum over them. This was done under antiseptic precautions, and in 4 of the cases repair took place by vascularization and organization of effused lymph as in the first series. The period of repair was shorter, averaging 45 days. In one of the cases which putrefied tetanus occurred and proved fatal, and the same disease carried off another case in which aseptic repair was pro- gressing satisfactorily. In the other septic case repair was slower than in the aseptic. 3. In the 2 cases complicated with hernia (t and u) in addition to the ordinary operation described above the sac was amputated after catgut ligature of its neck and the canal olosed by the same material. Fatal septic poisoning occurred in one case after putrefaction had invaded the wound. The other, in which castration of one testicle was performed, made a satisfactory and complete recovery. 4. The last series of 2 cases (v and w) supply an illus- tration of a disease which is occasionally met with in India, namely serpigenous or lupoid ulceration of the genital^. The process commences with a venereal sore (chancroid) ; from this as a centre or starting point or from a bubo resulting from it, ulceration gradually and very slowly spreads. The skin becomes tuberculated, the neoplasm breaks down and a circle of ulcer results) which is succeeded by an imperfect cicatrix- The scrotal and penile skin are destroyed, these organs get involved in a mass of cicatricial material and the ulceration spreads by circles and bays into the groins, thighs and buttocks Excision is the most easy and effective treat- ment, but scraping and the thorough use of strong

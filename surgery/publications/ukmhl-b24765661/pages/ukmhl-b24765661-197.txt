( 27 ) and the patient insisted on leaving hospital in three days. JX. i. Tracheotomy.—Hindu female, ret. 28. Had been admitted about 4 months previously into the second surgeon’s ward for acute laryngitis. Tra- cheotomy was found necessary on account of urgent dyspnoea. After two months’ detention in hospital she was discharged apparently well; she remained well for a month when the laryngeal symptoms recurred with an attack of fever, the difficulty of breathing again becoming alarming, she sought re- admission into hospital, when it was found necessary to repeat the operation (at the former site) and re- introduce a tube. This gave complete relief. She remained 137 days in hospital; the glottis continued so thickened and contracted that she could not breathe comfortably without the tube. She was subjected to various plans of treatment. Her gene- ral health was good, and becoming impatient of de- tention, she was provided with a tube and allowed to leave hospital; she has not been heard of since. 2. Herniotomy.—a.

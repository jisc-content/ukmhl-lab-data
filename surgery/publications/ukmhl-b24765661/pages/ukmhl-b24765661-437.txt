PEECIS OP OPERATIONS. 11 severe operation for necrosis of left tibia in 1886 (see precis for that year IY 1. h. iv). Two sinuses remained five months after it, tlirougti which dead done could be detected. These were laid freely open and several sequestra and much debris removed. He still remains in hospital ; the wounds having not yet healed. iii. Hindu male, cet. 20. Acute necrosis of left tibia, consequent on an attack ot fever a year ago. The greater part of the shaft of the bone had died, and two long incisions were neces- sary for exposure and removal of the fragments. He remained in hospital 152 days, aud was finally discharged with a souud leg. The removal of flabby granulations and debris by means of the gouge, sharp spoon and osteotrite was fount! necessary in most of these cases. Thoroughly cleaning the cavity containing the sequestra in this manner greatly accelerates subsequent repair, and most frequently, in combination with antiseptic irrigation, renders the wound aseptic. The application of the elastic cord in these cases minimises loss of blood and gives a good view •of the parts during operation.

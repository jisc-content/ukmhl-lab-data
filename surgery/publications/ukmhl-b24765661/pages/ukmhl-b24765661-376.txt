PBECIS OP OPERATIONS. 86 corresponds very closely to the rate (14-7' which prevailed among the operations included in my work on “ Operative Surgery.” The rate would be somewhat raised if I in eluded four cases which were removed in i hopeless state. So much depends upon tin i class of cases included in such a series as tin i present that a general mortality - rate is a verj uncertain index of surgical success. As, how- ever, scrupulous care was taken to include it this series the same kind of operations as . published in the work referred to, the rates an fairly comparable,and their close correspondeuct I is remarkable. I would impose upon the figure: no heavier burden than to indicate that tin success obtained in 1886 was not worse thai in 1879-83. The enhancement of the rate by including moribuiuls would be balanced b} counting separately two or more operations oi | the same subject which has not been done. 2. Death causes.

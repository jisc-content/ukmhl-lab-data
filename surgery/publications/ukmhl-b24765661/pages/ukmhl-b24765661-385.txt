7 PRECIS OP OPERATIONS. (articular extremities of the humerus, radius and | ulma being freely removed. The wound healed i in 23 days, and patient left hospital with a moveable and useful joint in 52 days. b. Excision of the knee-joint.—Hindu male, t cet 25.

It i healed kindly, and patient left hospital in 122 j days with a straight limb, on which he could ( walk with ease. %* The details of this case have been pub- i Lulled at page 209 of vol. XXIL An operation ( performed on a similar plan was published in i last year’s “ precis.” The result in the present j case was very satisfactory as regards the length l and position of the limb and the strength and t stability of the union.

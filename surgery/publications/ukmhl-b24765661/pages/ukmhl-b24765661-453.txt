Mahomedan, cet. 45. Admitted with a large scrotal tumour of 12 years’ growth ; its transverse circumference was 46 inches and antero-posterior 44 inches. When he stood it reached to within 6 inches of the ground. There was a history of gonorrhoea and syphilis, and about 25 years ano he was tapped and injected for hydrocele. Has been suffering from fever lately ; is weak, and emaciated, arid a confirmed opium eater. Operation was tit first declined owing to the man’s exceedingly feeble cachetic condition, but a small orifice appeared on the right scrotum through which in two days about 15 lbs. of grumous foetid pus escaped, and as the right half of the tumour was found to be an im- mense abscess cavity, it was thought best to re- move the whole mass. The usual operation was performed, but the right testicle was removed with the mass, the left being secured in a pocket as usual. About 15 lbs. of pus came out of the abscess cavity, and a large haematocele with very thick walls was found on the right side, outside of which but not communicating with it the abscess had formed. The man was low after operation, but made a good recovery in 71 days. The mass which was removed weighed 31 lbs., and the pus must have weighed at least 30 lbs. iu addition.

( 46 ) bladder distended. Free opening made in the middle line of the perinasum ; floor of urethra found extensively destroyed ; wound sloughy ; patient in a state of prostra- tion, with diarrhoea and hiccup : this lasted for about 10 days. The wound cleaned and contracted, and the gene- ral condition improved. A sinus extending towards the rectum had to be slit open. The perinreal fistula remain- ing widely open, a plastic operatiou was performed 97 days after the perineal section. Flaps were made at the sides of the opening and brought together by horse- hair stitches. This reduced the opening to a very small size. A No. 12 catheter was passed every few days, and the most of the [urine passed by urethram. He became impatient of treatment, and left hospital 20 days after the last operation. b. Hindu male ret. 20. Ruptured his urethra 2 days before admission by falling on an iron rod. Blood passes from the urethra, and the perinseum is hard, tense, tender and swollen. Free incision made in the middle line, clots cleared out, No. 10 catheter passed into bladder and wound dressed with boracic gauze. The most of the urine at first passed through the wound which granulated and contracted. As it contracted a larger proportion, in 23 days the whole passed per urethram. Left hospital 26 days after the operation. c. Hindu male act. 30. Urinary fistula in left groin consequent on an abscess in the left inguinal region, opened 1^ month before admission ; perinasum painful, swollen and fluctuating. Incised in middle line. A large quantity of pus escaped ; urethra incised to extent of ftli in. Inguinal fistula gradually closed and then the peroneal. A full sized catheter was passed every third day, and he left hospital in 72 days without either stricture or fistula. [The fistula in this case was evi- dently due to pelvic cellulitis caused by urinary abscess forming behind the triangular ligament.]

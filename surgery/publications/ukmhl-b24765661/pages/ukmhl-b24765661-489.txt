9 PBECIS OF OPERATIONS. finger and thumb of the left hand, the v&s deferens was allowed to escape inwards and a needle passed from before backwards between it and the varicose mass ’ A thread of stout catgut was carried through. The veins were now allowed to escape inwards and the needle en- tered through the posterior puncture and made to emerge at the anterior. The veins were then en- circled in a loop, which was tied tight and buried. Two 'such loops were placed—one just above the testicle and the other below the external ring;, the punctures were closed with collodion. No suppuration took place, but some induration appeared around the loops and some oedema of the scrotum was observed. No serious con- stitutional disturbance ensued. The patients re- mained 13, 18, 26, ami 43 days in hospital, and the varicose mass underwent diminution in hulk, hut some swelling remained. The condition was greatly improved in all cases ; hut in none did complete shrinking and obliteration of the mass occeur. Two of these operations were per - formed by Dr. Kaye. 3. Ligature and excision of varicocele after ex- posure by antiseptic incision.—The subjects of this more radical procedure were a Eurasian male, CEt. 19, operated on by Dr. Kaye, and a Euro- pean, bet. 26, by Dr. Jameson. One side was involved in either case. The varicocele was reached by a lateral incision, the mass separated from the vas and the artery and tied in two places ; the intermediate portion was removed and the wound stitched and dressed • antisepri- callv. The first case healed bp first intention in eight days and the last by granulation in twenty-

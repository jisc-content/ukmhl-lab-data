( 24 ) small superficial sore remains. Vitality of extremity not impaired. No pulse at the wrist. Little or no constitution- al disturbance throughout. Boracic dressing used. 7. Angioma of ear.—Hindu male aet. 24. Eight pinna enormously swollen ; began to swell 5 years ago. Part livid, hot, pulsating. A curved needle was passed beneath the posterior auricular and the branches of the temporal and occipital arteries, supplying the ear, and double catgut threads tied tightly over rolls of boracic gauze. The pulsation stopped at once, the pinna got gradually smaller, cooler and firmer. The ligatures came away in about a fortnight, the part of the threads in contact with the tissues having been almost or en- tirely absorbed. Small linear ulcers remained which soon healed. Left the hospital 18 days after the operation greatly relieved. 8. Mucous polypus of mouth,.—Hindu male set. 16.

Lyvipho-sarcoma of axilla.—Hindu male, ait. 28. Noticed a nodule in the right axilla two years ago. This lias grown rapidly till the axilla is distended with a large nodulated mass which is also felt a,bove the clavicle. The mass was .exposed by free incision and remov- i ed. Haemorrhage which was profuse, was con- trolled by pressure forceps until the points were secured by ligature. The operation was followed by pneumonia, of right base. This brought him very low but, he eventually recov- ered and left hospital 50 days after operation. The wound gaped and healed mostly by gran- ulation. '(Dr. Raye.)

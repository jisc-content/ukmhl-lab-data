( 10 ) mouth was opened by repeated use of Smith” gag. Remained 53 days in hospital. b. Humerus.—Hindu male, aet. 25. Had an abscess of right arm 6 years ago, which has never closed. Numerous subcutaneous abscess- es appeared on other parts of his body, which healed after discharge of matter. Movable dead bone detected through the sinus of arm. This was enlarged under chloroform and two sequestra removed—one two inches long. A drainage tube was inserted and the wound dressed antiseptically. The sinus healed sound- ly. He had an attack of dysentery during convalescence. Discharged in 45 days. 2. Gouging out oj carious os calcis.—Hindu male, aet. 30. A nail entered above his right heel, and though it was extracted at once, inflamma- tion and suppuration followed requiring three successive incisions—over the tendo Achillis, at the lower third of the leg, and on the sole. After a month it was discovered that the os calcis was carious. It was exposed by longitudinal inci- sion and about -§rds of it gouged out. 171 days have elapsed (5th March) since the operation. The old sinuses still remain open, and a new gathering formed over the instep. 1 The cavity of the operation wound has not closed. The ankle is swollen but the joint is movable. He has improved in health, but disease of the tarsus still exists, and amputation will probably be necessary. 3. Refracture of the femur.—Hindu male, aet. 30. Had sustained a fracture of the middle of the right femur 3 months ago. It was unskil- fully treated, and united at a consider- able angle. The limb was 3 inches shorter

( 27 ) pressure, and considerable difficulty in breathing and swallowing. Straight incision made in front of the sterno-mastoid and 13 glandular masses enucleated. Stopped breathing in the course of the operation. Breathing re-established by arti- ficial respiration and operation completed. Did not recover consciousness, became asphyxiated, and had spasm of the glottis. Tracheotomy performed after forcible traction of the tongue by forceps, &c., failed to relieve the obstruction. Artificial respiration diligently carried out by direct method without avail. On post-mortem examination heart found dilated and fatty. All the signs of death by asphyxia present. No injury of pneumogastric or other impor- tant structure. Lungs congested. No blood in air tubes. 7. Angioma {venous) of abdominal wall.— Mahomedan male, set. 35. Admitted with a small tumour over the xyphoid cartilage, of 5 years’ duration, bleeding profusely through a small orifice—dilated veins coursing up to it from below ; burst 6 days ago. It was laid open and a cavity was found, out of which venous blood gushed freely. Pressure below it restrained the flow, and a strong catgut thread was passed deeply through the abdominal wall on this as- pect of the tumour, and tied over a roll of bora- cic gauze. This caused the welling to cease. A graduated compress of lint soaked in tinct. per. perchlorid. was placed on the tumour. He had a severe attack of fever the same day. Abdomen became tympanitic ; right lung pneu- monic. Symptoms of typhoid prostration ensued and he diec 51 hours after operation. No post-mortem examination was allowed.

40 PRECIS OF OPERATIONS. Some difficulty was experienced in dissecting out the sac which was closely adherent to the tissues surrounding it, in consequence of the former operation. At its fundus, a ring of thick tissue with central hollow, the expanded neck, of the previous sac, was found. Special care was- taken to close the aperture. The cavity of the wound got filled with blood and he suffered from fever and bronchitis for 11 days. The woundi gaped and healed by granulation. He was dis- charged cured with a double truss in 45 days. xii. European male, cut. 12. Left oblique inguinal hernia. Usual operation. Made an ex- cellent recovery in 19 days. *** The steps of the operation performed in these cases were precisely the same as described, in full detail in previous reports. A counter opening was made in the scrotum for drainage in all cases. In most of the cases a well fitting truss would, no doubt, have kept the rupture under control ; but patients of the classes who resort to hospital canuot afford to purchase trus- ses, and when they are supplied with them, they have not the sense to wear them properly, and they soon become useless, and are causes rather of danger than help. The operation in the fatal case was performed at the repeated and earnesti request of the patient, rather against my judg- ment. He had delicate lungs, and though be was kept under treatment, and with benefit for some time, he developed double pneumonia very soon after the operation and died of it. None of the other cases gave any cause for anxiety. Each patient was provided with a truss on discharge with, injunctions to wear it for six months.

( 49 ) The experience furnished by these four cases is in favor of resorting to the further measure of extirpating the sac when operation is re- quired for the relief of strangulation, more espe- cially if the sac has to be opened. Eight oper- ations were performed for the radical cure of rupture, according to the plan described in previous reports. The only changes of proce- dure which additional experience has taught are these,â€”(i) opening into the sac at once no danger arises from so doing if antiseptic precautions are followed, and it greatly facili- tates dissecting out the sac and saves handling and tearing of the fasciae ; the descent of intes- tine is prevented by sponge pressure on the can- al ; (2) making in every case a counter-opening in the fundu^ of the scrotum to drain the cavity left by removal of the sac and inserting a drain- age tube into it. This tube may be removed in two or three days according to the amount of discharge. I consider this a great improvement in the operation. The result of the operations of the year is very satisfactory. One man unfortunately got tetanus while he was rapidly recovering from the operation. His friends insisted on removing him, and the final issue of the case could not be ascertained. All the other cases succeeded well. In one case the wound became putrid and suppurated ; and in two the wound inflamed and suppurated without putrefaction. The average age of the patients was 28 years, and the average period of deten- tion in hospital (excluding the tetanus case) ^9 days. The dressing used in all cases was boracic lint next the wound and carbolic gauze and oiled paper outside of it. It is curious to note

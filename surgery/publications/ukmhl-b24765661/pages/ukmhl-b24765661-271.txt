( S3 ) lieved by catheter ; boggy swelling in perinaeum. Perinaeum laid freely open and No. 11 catheter introduced into the bladder per urethram Urine turbid, ammoniacal. Deep tissues of perinaeum gangrenous. Considerable bleeding followed, which was stopped by plugging. Patient con- tinued to suffer from fever of typhoid type. He got diarrhoea and sank of exhaustion two days after operation. [In 6 of these 8 cases the urethra was reached without a guide, by what is known as Cock’s operation. This is an exceedingly easy proce- dure, and applicable to cases when from lacera- tion of urethra extravasation or other cause a ^uide cannot be introduced. The stricture can subsequently be divided by prolonging the sec- tion forwards until it reaches the point of an instrument passed down through the urethra. This practice has frequently been followed by my colleague Surgeon-Major D. O’C. Raye and myself with good result. It is advisable to pass a large sized instrument into the bladder at once, and after a week or so intro- duce it again and continue the use of it at short intervals, until the perinaeal wound closes. I prefer this procedure to Wheelhousc’s opera- tion, which is both difficult and tecious.] 7. Internal urethrotomy.—West Indian male, set. 18. Admitted with two organic strictures— one about two inches from the external meatus, and the second in the membranous part of the urethra. Anterior stricture divided by a bistoury on a director ; posterior by Civiale’s urethro- tome. Full sized bougies were subsequently passed to maintain the patency of the canal, Remained under treatment for 40 days.

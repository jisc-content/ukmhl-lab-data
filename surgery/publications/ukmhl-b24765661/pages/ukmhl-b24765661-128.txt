( 20 ) a nodule under the angle of the lower jaw, right aide. Had undergone very rapid increase ; is situated in the anterior triangle, pushing the larynx to the left, extending behind body of lower jaw, and forming a swelling in the pharynx, fungating externally. Surrounding tissues ccdematous ; outline of rumour ill defined ; very sparingly movable. No enlarged glands ; general health poor ; no specific history. Suffers much from dyspnoea and dys- phagia ; face livid ; asphyxiation imminent. Tracheotomy performed on admission : great relief experienced ; colour was restored and dyspnoea subsided ; tube left in fora week and then removed. Had to be reinserted after another week for renewed dyspnoea. The tumour became more defined after the oedema subsided. Two abscesses form- ed—the one in the left groin the other in the left buttock. They were opened and healed kindly. New nodules began to grow in the neighbourhood of the tumour, and the consent of the patient’s guardians having been obtained, an attempt was made to extirpate the tumour 39 days after the tracheotomy. ( hloroform was admi- nistered through the tube. The skin was divided by a triangular incision whose base was parallel to the lower border of the lower jaw outer side to the sterno-mastoid and iuner to the middle. After a prolonged and intricate dissection, during which the patient ceased to breathe and artificial respiration had to be resorted to, the mass was thoroughly extirpated. Part of the sterno-mastoid and the subinaxillary gland were removed and the facial superior thyroid and lingual vessels tied ; preliminary ligation was resorted to in separating the deep attach- ments. The carotid sheath was not involved. The lower jaw was laid bare and subsequently an exfoliation separated from it. The wound was left open and dressed with boracic gauze. It filled up with granula- tion material and contracted to some extent, but the growth recurred and a similar tumour appeared in the

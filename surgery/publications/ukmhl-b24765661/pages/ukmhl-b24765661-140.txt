( 32 ) which infiltrates the cords and causes them to swell some- what. When the cords are long and voluminous a tumour of considerable size forms at the root of the penis. The testes remain embedded in their pockets without any per- ceptible change except that all spaces between and around them are filled with lymph. The sutures are embedded in this material which forms a putty-iike cement, filling up the wound from edge to edge and presenting a straw-coloured surface marbled with blood clots. In a week or 10 days this becomes vascularized, shreds of lytni>h peel off nd the surface becomes red and granular. The mass now undergoes rapid absorption. Cicatriza- tion commences at the edge and rapidly extends from every side towards the root of the penis. The testes are covered in with skin, and finally a cicatricial circle ascends from the root of the penis and descends from the corona glandis, and in about 6 weeks the whole is covered. During the process it is important to prevent the penis being drawn into the cicatrizing mass. This may be done by diligently keeping the root free and perhaps snipping the granulations through on its under surface if they threaten to retract the organ too much. No pus formation occurs if the wound remains aseptic, and putrefaction is very rarely perceptible, If any sign of it becomes evident the free use of tincture of iodine suffices to extirpate it. Of this series of cases only one died of tetanus which supervened while the wound was in process of normal (aseptic) repair. The average weight of the tumours was 1 lb 6 oz., and the mean period of detention in hospital 64 days. The plan of operation and dressing adopted in these cases results in a great saving of suffering, constitutional and local, obviates all offensive odour, diminishes mor- tality and reduces the period of detention in hospital. 2. The second series (?*â€”s) of 6 cases include those in which large hydroceles and hmmatoceles were complicat-

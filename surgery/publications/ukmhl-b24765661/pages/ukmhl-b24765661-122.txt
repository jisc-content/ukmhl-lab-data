( 14 ) be inflammatory rather than cancerous. Clinically it presented all the features of malignancy pain, cachexy, infiltration, rapid but gradual growth and break- ing down into a sloughy cavern with indurated base and edges and irregular mammillated surface. [I am inclined to attribute the unfortunate issue in this case to carbolic acid poisoning. The wound pursued an aseptic course and repair was proceeding actively. The only trace of suppuration which was observed was a little pus which formed at the outer angle. The gastro- enteric irritation, smoky urine, pyrexia and head symptoms point to carbolic absorption. The change of dressings produced no improvement. Thrombosis l^ad apparently taken place in the left axillary and innominate veins. A post-mortem examination could not be obtained.] 2. (aj. Epithelioma of lip.—Mahomedan male set, 40 ; 2 months’ duration ; involved whole of lower lip, which was thickened, indurated, everted and ulcerated ; lym- phatic glands below chin enlarged and a solitary gland on right side of middle line lower down. General health indifferent. Lower lip entirely removed. Vertical inci- sion inch long carried down to chin and lateral curved incisions from the end of it downwards and outwards ; flaps dissected off. A few labial glands removed and the whole of the enlarged lymphatic glands. Flaps united in middle line and raised so as to form a new lower lip, which was first held up by wire loops secured to a bandage fastened round the head and then by buttons, the wires attached to which were fastened to the teeth. Wound healed mostly by first intention, the triangular wound below the chin by granulation ; suffer- ed from pneumonia and parotitis ; made a satisfactory recovery. Lower lip half covered, the lower teeth and mouth could be closed almost completely. No reappear- ance of the disease during the 72 days he spent in hos- pital after the operation.

( *3 ) upper third of left leg by the kick of a horse 20 hours before admission. Next morning the whole leg was found to be gangrenous. Temperature 102°, tongue dry. Carden’s amputation was performed under strict antiseptic precautions. The knee joint was found full of sanguineous serum, and the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the limb tensely infiltrated with the same. Patient sank 15 hours after the operation. He never rallied, and death appeared to be due partly to shock and partly to septicaemia. 3. Secondary amputation above the ankle joint (Syme's). a.—For gangrene.—Mahomedan male, set. 40 ; left foot crushed by the wheel of a trolly ; foot became gangrenous after a week’s stay in hospital. As much skin as remained alive saved ; no stitches inserted. Operation performed antiseptically; wound remained sweet and healed by granulation. The skin was dragged over the face of the stump during the process of cicatrization. This was aided by careful application of straps. A sound stump eventually resulted, which bore the weight of the body well. Patient discharged 127 days after the opera- tion, able to walk with a high-heeled boot. b. Hindu male, set. 40 ; left foot severely crush- ed by the wheel of a cart. Extensive suppuration and sloughing with severe constitutional symptoms set in a few days, and amputation became necessary to save both life and limb. Syme’s incisions were followed as closely as the state of parts permitted. The heel flap sloughed in a few days, and a gangrenous abscess formed in the calf, spreading up along the tendo Achillis. A free counter-opening was made; the abscess healed, the wound became clean, and sufficient skin remained to cover the stump. The process of repair was protracted. He left hospital after a stay of 117 days in good health, and able to walk with a high-heeled boot. 4. Seco?idary amputation oj the arm for necrosis. Hindu female, set. 25, left forearm bitten off by an

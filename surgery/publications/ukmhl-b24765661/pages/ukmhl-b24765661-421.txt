This boy sustained a severe burn 2^ years ago, which caused adhesion of the right arm to the chest wall, and flexion of the arm and forearm. He had undergone two previous operations, one in 1885 by Dr. Raye, and one by myself in 1886 (see “ Prdcis ” for that year X. 5. ii.) The forearm was still flexed on the arm, and retained in that position by a triangular cicatricial web. A similar web bound the arm to the chest, but the extremity had been con- siderably (reed bv the previous operations. On the 16th of March the triangular web connect- mg the arm and forearm was divided in the mid- dle, and flaps were taken from the sides and placed on the flexor aspect of the elbow joint. These adhered, and the limb was gradually made straight. ii. On the 20th of July, the other web was divided, and a large flap taken from the back and transplanted under the armpit. This par- tially sloughed, but enough remained to prevent reformation of a web. He left the hospital after a slay of 295 days in good health, and with much greater freedom of movement of the ex- tremity.

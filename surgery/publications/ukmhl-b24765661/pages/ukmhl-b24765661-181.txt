( II ) The wound closed and the bone united, with the exception, that a small fragment at the upper and outer aspect of it, remained detached from the rest of the mass. He has been seen walking about recently (March 1883) without difficulty or halt. b. Hindu male, set. 40, sustained transverse fracture of the right patella by a fall on the knee while in a bent position. The joint was much swollen, and the fargments remained inches apart, and could not be brought closer. A single vertical incision was made, large clots cleared out of the joint and the cavity of the fracture. The fragments were then drilled and approximated by twisted silver sutures. The operation was performed under strict antiseptic precautions, but symptoms of carbolic poisoning set in ; the carbolic dressings were exchanged for boracic ; putrefaction invaded the wound and joint which suppurated. Drainage tubes were inserted \ the wires were withdrawn after 49 and 58 days ; the wound eventually closed, the bone united, and patient left hospital in 132 days, able to walk fairly well with the aid of crutches. He has been lost sight of. [The first of these cases seemed at first to be a perfect success, but the accident of refracture, which has been repeatedly recorded in similar cases, delayed the cure which was eventually satisfactory. In the second case the occurrence of carbolic poisoning and subsequent putrefaction of the wound militated against success. The result, as observed when he left hospital, was not very gratifying, and the lame stiff joint, which served the purpose of progres- sion very indifferently, was a somewhat disappointing outcome of much suffering, and long confinement to bed, on the part of the patient, and great anxiety and labour on the part of his attendants.] 2.

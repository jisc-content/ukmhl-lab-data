180 INDURATION IN THE PRIMARY women_, and is a firm supporter of the old doctrine,, states in his ^ Le9ons cliniques sur la Syphilis ' that induration is so constant in syphilitic infecting chancres that its absence is an actual curiosity ; later on^ however^ he admits that even to an experienced observer its presence may some- times be doubtful. He then adduces 100 cases of such sores, and admits that in thirteen he was unable to detect any induration ; eight of these he explains away as being in such a position, viz. at the vaginal orifice, as not to be able to be taken between the finger and thumb ; otherwise he assumes induration would have been detec- ted. There still remain five cases in the hundred which even to his experience presented no induration. So large a proportion as 5 per cent, hardly justifies us in consider- ing the absence of induration as a curiosity for its rareness ; rather such an admission from one seeking to uphold the universality of induration is significant. Although many observers have stated in a general way that they have seen cases where syphilis has followed non- indurated sores, such statements convey merely a vague impression, and it is only by carefully recorded facts that any fixed conclusion can be arrived at. The writer of these notes commenced clinical observa- tions on the subject with the belief that marked and characteristic induration was the special distinguishing mark of the infecting chancre ; experience^ however, soon proved that this was far from being the case. It is to be kept in mind that the question here raised is not whether that class of sores known as the soft suppurating chancre or chancroid is ever capable of infecting the system, an important question requiring separate investigation; but whether syphilitic infecting chancres ever lack the special character, induration. In other words whether "induration â– " is an essential charac- ter of the infecting chancre. Amongst these recorded cases there are nine which go to substantiate the fact that syphilitic infecting sores may be totally wanting in the character of induration or

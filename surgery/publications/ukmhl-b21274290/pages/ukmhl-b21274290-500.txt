DESCRIPTION OF PLATES YII and YIII. (Three Cases of Alcoholic Paralysis (Multiple Neuritis), by Datid W. Finlay, B.A., M.D., F.R.C.P.) Plate YII. (From drawings by Dr. Finlay.) Fig. 1 (E. F—, Case !).■—Transverse section of plantar nerve, stained with logwood and mounted in Canada baisam, showing thickening of the perineurium and of the walls of the blood-vessels, with proliferation of nuclei and leucocytal infiltration. X 175 (about). Fig. 2.—Part of the same section more highly magnified. The appearances of degeneration in the parenchyma of the nerve are better seen; the small dark spots are remaining axis-cylinders, some of the larger are probably swollen a,xis-cylinder8 ; the others are nuclei of the nerve-sheaths and leucocytes. The compara- tively hazy-looking large round bodies are nerve-tubules with granular contents from which the axis-cylinders have disappeared. X 450. Fig. 3.—Normal nerve, transverse section, for comparison with Fig. 2, and prepared in the same way. X 450. Plate YIII. (From drawings by Dr. Finlay,) Fig. 4 (E. F—, Case 1).—Plantar nerve : fibres teased out, treated with osmic acid and mounted in glycerine, showing degeneration and segmentation of the myelin. X 450. Fig. 5.—Extensor carpi radialis longior. Transverse section stained with logwood and mounted in Canada balsam. Many of the muscle-fibres are atrophied, and the whole section is crowded with nuclei and leucocytes. X 175 (about). Fig. 6 (M. J. P—, Case 2).—Anterior tibial nerve, longitudinal section, stained with osmic acid and carmine, and mounted in Canada balsam. The appearances are entirely similar to those found in Case 1 (Fig. 4). x 450.

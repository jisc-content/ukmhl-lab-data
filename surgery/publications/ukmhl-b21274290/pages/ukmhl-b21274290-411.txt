WEJTERS^ CRAMP AND IMPAIRED WRITING POWER. 307 SuB-G-ROUP B.â€”Change of muscular irritability without nerve-tenderness (21 cases). By change in muscular irritability is meant merely a change in the irritability to faradism^ tested by a com- parison of the effects of equal currents applied to corre- sponding muscles in either hand or arm. The hands are placed symmetrically and at absolute rest (usually hanging over the back of a chair). One rheophore is then fixed to the nape of the neck, while the other (a rheophore of small surface) is applied delicately to the muscles which it is wished to test. Having deter- mined the least strength of current which will cause the contraction of a muscle (and I usually begin with the first dorsal interosseous) on the left (and presumably healthy) side, the same current is then applied to the corresponding muscle on the right side, and any difference in the effect is noted. When it is stated that the muscular irritability is depressed or heightened it means that the muscle responds to the current less readily or more readily than the same muscle on the left side. To detect the differences requires some care but not more care than is required to detect the alterations of tone observed in the eye-muscles in severe cases of diplopia. Each of these 21 cases had muscles manifesting a decrease of irritability. In 3 there were muscles mani- festing an increase of irritability alongside of others which showed a deficiency. The first right dorsal interosseous (1st E. D. I.) was affected thirteen times. The abductor and opponens pollicis eight times. The second right dorsal interosseous six times. The fourth right dorsal interosseous and flexor longus pollicis were affected twice, the third dorsal and fourth palmar interosseous each once, and the extensors of the thumb and small muscles of the little finger each once.

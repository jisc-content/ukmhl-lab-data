When these small muscles of pen-prehension fail, bigger muscles (such as the superficial and deep flexor of the fingers and the long flexor of the thumb) take their place, and I believe that the tenderness of the median nerve is dependent upon the over-use of these (median) muscles. In the early days of these cases it is possible that one or more of the deep branches of the ulnar nerve may have been tender in association with over-use of ulnar muscles, but this, of course, is only a surmise. No thickening of any nerve-trunk was detected in these cases. Trophic lesions were not common. In No. 77 (Mr. Barker's case) the nails of the affected arm grew slowly. No. 78 was troubled by coldness and blueness of the hand. No. 102 had a congenital brown mark on the inner side of the right arm. No. 128 had pitting of the right finger-nails. No. 130 had a crop of moles on the right arm and a lichenous rash on the right forearm. No. 144 had brittleness and furrowing of the right thumb-nail, and No. 149 had throbbing of the thumb after writing. Gout,^^ rheumatism,'' and creaking and thickening of joints were tolerably common. Tremor was a very common symptom and is recorded in 87 out of the total of 168 cases. It is a symptom of varied significance and appears to be liable to occur with defects at any part of the motor path. In some few instances the tremor was of very limited extent. No. 121 had tremor of the thumb only, accom- panied by slight wasting of the abductor and opponens pollicis. No. 122 had tremor of the middle finger only. No. 150 had tremor of the far-phalanx of the thumb only, and in this case there was deficient irritability of the extensors of the thumb as well as of the abductor and opponens. No. 160 had tremor of the thumb from a similar cause. Tremor of limited area may thus point to the fact that

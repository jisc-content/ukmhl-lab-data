EARLY DISSEMINATED MYELITIS. 89 fatal case recorded by Westplial^ in his paper on Dis- seminated Myelitis/^ A man, aged thirty-two, on the eleventh day after the first appearance of the rash of smallpox, had incontinence of urine. On the twelfth day he had retention of urine and paralysis of the left lower limb. On the thirteenth day both lower limbs were paralysed. Within the next few days he had involuntary defaecation. On the seventeenth day a sacral bedsore developed. The motor paralysis was complete, but sensation was only diminished. There was a feeling of constriction round the abdomen from the navel outwards. The muscles of the lower extremities responded to a strong induced current. Catheterism was necessary and cystitis developed. The bedsore increased. Rigors and pyrexia set in. The sen- sorium became blunted and the patient died four weeks after the onset of the paraplegia. At the autopsy the bedsore was found to have extended down to the sacrum and the trochanters. The pia mater of the brain was oedematous and mode- rately opaque in the sulci. There was no focus of disease in the hemispheres or medulla. The membranes of the cord were soft. There was marked congestion of the grey substance. In the lumbar region considerable difference was observed between the grey substance of the right side and that of the left. Whilst the right anterior and posterior cornua were of the usual grey colour the left horns were of a dark red- dishbrown. This condition extended up to the lower dorsal region. Above this the dark colour was manifest in the grey cornua of both sides. Higher still the nor- mal colour reappeared. In the upper dorsal region there was a considerable extent of softening, so that the left anterior horn, with a little of the left posterior horn, was actually hollowed out. There was also slight hollow- ing out, consequent on softening in the right anterior horn. 1 ' Archiv fiir Psychiatrie/ Bd. iv, 1873, p. 338,

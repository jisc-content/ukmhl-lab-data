48 OVARIOTOMY. of the severe cases. It is a most difficult matter to decide when to use it and when not to do so. I shall refer to this matter again in speaking of the fatal cases. Passing now to the consideration of the column which deals with the after-history of the patients, one is at once struck with some very important facts. Thus, all but two of the patients from whom I have removed sarcomatous ovarian tumours have died within or near the year, with recurrence, or are now in a hopeless condition. The two exceptions are both married women, have both borne children since, and have both survived the operation long enough to make me hope that they are not going to have any recurrence. The saddest fact brought out in this column is the number of patients that sooner or later succumb to malignant disease, in one form or another, or with some mysterious undiagnosed ailment which makes one suspect malignant disease. I believe that the vast majority of these recurrent growths are sarcomata. I have only seen one undoubted case of solid cancer of the ovary, No. 229. Some of the papillomata very closely resemble the epitheliomata and cylindrical cancers, but the recurrent tumours seem gene- rally to be sarcomata. With the abundant material at hand there is a fine field open to the pathologist in the study of these ovarian tumours and the recurrent growths which follow their removal, especially if it be worked side by side with the development of the ovary and its con- tained follicles and ova. I have myself worked in it sufficiently, when I had more leisure, to make me quite sure that no one has as yet got upon the right track for thoroughly mastering the histology and pathology of the ovary. Anyone looking down the columns of ^' subsequent history,^' will see how many cases have died of recurrent sarcoma, and how many in which the tumour removed has been to all appearance of the ordinary innocent type have died of peritoneal cancer. I have used this term because

MULTIPLE GANGRENE OP THE SKIN 402 sent. On the thorax there were some signs of repair in the ulcerSj but those on the buttocks were very deep, clean cut, and undermined. On the scalp they were not numerous, but two of them, the size of a florin and half a crown respectively, in the occipital and left parieto- occipital regions, went down to the pericranium. There was no attempt at symmetrical distribution anywhere except on the thorax.

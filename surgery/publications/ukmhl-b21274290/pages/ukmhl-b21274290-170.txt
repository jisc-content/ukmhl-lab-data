EARLY DISSEMINATED MYELITIS. 78 trunk many patches were confluent, and some areas were as big as a shilling. The superficial lymphatic glands were enlarged. There was injection of the conjunctiva, and the nostrils were red and swollen, but there was no actual coryza. The tongue was coated with a thin and creamy fur, and there was slight punctate injection of the palate and fauces. There was no audible rhonchus, but the patient was hoarse, and complained of soreness down the breast- bone, and at the epigastrium. He had no backache, and had had no vomiting. His pulse was 92, and bis temperature 100*8°. He was kept in bed on spoon diet and ordered some colocynth and hyoscyamus pills, and a linctus for his cough. His bowels acted freely next evening, and he passed his urine naturally. His temperature on the 12th was 100° F. and 100-2° F. He still complained of pain down the sternum, and at the ensiform cartilage, and was ordered some benzoin inhalations, with a view to relieve it. On the 13th the rash was fading, but was still very marked, and there was considerable intermediate staining of the skin of the trunk. There was a slight apex systolic murmur to be heard. The pulse was 76, soft and regular. There were a few rales in the chest. Again the patient's only complaint was of the pain down the sternum and at the epigastrium. At midnight it was ascertained that he had been several hours unable to pass his urine, it was therefore withdrawn by catheter and found to be quite clear and free from albumen. His temperature this morning was 100, but rose in the evening to 103'8°. On the 14th the patient's morning temperature was 103*2°. He was very drowsy. He could be roused, and then answered questions with a little irritability, but presently relapsed into his former drowsy state. He swallowed without difficulty, but required to be persuaded to take food.

ALCOHOLIC PARALYSIS. 389 ted, and she may now be pronounced convalescent. She has steadily gained weight (from 7st. 8| lbs. on March 11th, to 9 st. 4 lbs. on May 6th), and she eats and sleeps well. The patellar and plantar reflexes are still absent. Bemarhs.â€”I have brought these cases under the notice of the Society in the hope that they would form a con- tribution of some interest to the clinical history and pathology of alcoholic paralysis, especially since no cases accompanied by full pathological details are to be found in its published ^ Transactions.^ In saying this I am not unmindful of the papers contributed by Dr. Reginald Thompson and Dr. Broadbent in 1868 and 1884 respec- tively, but these dealt with the disease chiefly from the clinical standpoint. Until a few years ago the symptoms in cases such as those I have narrated were attributed to some change in the spinal cord, and this view was held by both British and foreign writers. Dr. Wilks, for instance, wrote of alcoholic^ paraplegia as a spinal affection from the influence of alcohol exerted on the spinal cord. Dr. Broadbent^s communication, also just referred to, bore the title ^' On a Form of Alcoholic Spinal Paralysis,^' and in the discussion which followed the reading of his paper at the Society^s meeting on February 12th, 1884, the opinion seemed to be generally held that the disease owed its symptoms to some change, either organic or dynamic^ in the cord.^ And it may be said that the writings of both German and French observers pointed for the most part to similar conclusions, till Lancereaux^ published cases in which the peripheral nerves were de- scribed as manifestly altered, a large number of the fibres of the nerves examined showing the myelin to be seg- mented in rounded granular masses of unequal size.

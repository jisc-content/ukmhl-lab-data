202 KUPTURE OF THE BLADDER. effused lympli, the peritoneum was everywhere injected^ and in the pelvis, where the inflammatory changes were most advanced, there were fifteen ounces of purulent fluid, and a quantity of lymph. The stomach and small intes- tines were irregularly distended. The rectum and sigmoid flexure contained a quantity of semi-solid faecal matter. A band one inch long united the fundus of the bladder to the anterior wall of the rectum. The vesical end of the band was hollowed out, and through a rupture in its walls, close to the bladder, a string of mucus was projecting. Slight pressure caused puriform-looking urine to ooze from the bladder, showing that there was at the rupture a direct communication between the bladder and the peritoneal cavity. The kidneys were congested, and the pelvis of each contained some purulent urine, and its lining membrane was inflamed. The other organs were normal. The rectum, bladder and penis, were removed en masse, and submitted to the examination by a Committee, which met at the Royal College of Surgeons, consisting of Mr. Savory, Mr. Bryant, Dr. Goodhart, and Dr. Fowler. The following is the report of the Committee : Report on the case of Rupture of the Bladder. August 13th, 1886. The undersigned met to-day at the Royal College of Surgeons, at the request of Mr. Henry Morris, to examine a specimen removed from a man who was under the care of Mr. Morris in June 1879, with what was then diagnosed as a ruptured bladder, and who left the hospital recovered. The patient was readmitted into the Middlesex Hospital, under the care of Dr. J. K. Fowler, on August 4th, 1886, suffering from acute peritonitis, caused, as was eventually shown, by the giving way of the bladder at the site of the old lesion, and he died on August 6th. The specimen consisted of the penis and bladder laid

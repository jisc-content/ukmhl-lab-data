428 CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE LIPS AND MOUTH. cure has at length resulted under opium. The subject of this case is a farmer from near Rugby, named Sâ€”, about 66 years of age. He had always been a remarkably strong, healthy man, until his sore mouth set in. He was sent to me by Dr. Clement Dukes, of Rugby, in the beginning of December, 1885. He had at that time suffered from sore mouth for about six weeks, and it had resisted various methods of treatment, which had been perseveringly used.

The opium had caused him much constipation, but at this date I increased it to eight minims, giving at the same time aperients. A fortnight later I had the pleasure of finding his tougue almost well, and his lips and mouth

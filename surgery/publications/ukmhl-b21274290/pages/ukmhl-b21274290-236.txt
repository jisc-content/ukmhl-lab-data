DESCRIPTION OF PLATES IV, V, and VI. (A Case of Multiple Embolism of tlie Arteries of tlie Extremities, followed by tbe formation of Aneurisms. By John Langton, F.R.C.S., and Anthony A. Bowlby, F.R.C.S. Plate IV. The left side of the heart, showing warty growths on the aortic valves with ulceration of one of the cusps, and the formation of an aneurismal pouch behind the left posterior segment; the aorta is in part covered by granulations, and about an inch above its origin presents a small ulcer. Plate V. The aorta, with the iliac and femoral vessels. The right common iliac contains a calcareous embolus just above its bifurcation, and in this situation the vessel is a little bulged and its wall ulcerated. The left external iliac is the seat of an aneurism, and the left com- mon femoral is shrunken and filled with an old adherent clot. Plate VI. The right brachial and ulnar vessels. A bristle has been passed through an ulcerated aperture in the brachial, just above its bifurca- tion, into the sac of a diffused aneurism. The radial and ulnar arteries contain portions of a calcareous embolus. The brachial artery has been tied a little above the place where it is ulcerated.

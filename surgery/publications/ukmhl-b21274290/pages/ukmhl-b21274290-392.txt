SACCULATED AORTIC ANEUEISM. 288 Conclusions. 1. Moore's treatment is worthy of further careful trial in properly chosen cases. 2. The operation should be performed before there is reason to suspect rupture of the sac. 3. Only a small quantity of wire should be introduced at any one time. 4. No firm pressure should be made over the aneurism afterwards.

On February ]2th, 1878, I had the honour of commu- nicating to this Society a paper containing an analysis of 75 cases of " Writers' Cramp and Impaired Writing Power.'^-^ I wish now to supplement that paper by com- municating some of the details of 93 additional cases, making a total of 168. For the purpose of reference, and to avoid confusion, the cases which form the basis of the present paper are num- bered from 70 to 168. My first series of cases was arranged in 6 groups, viz. : 1. Paralytic (6 cases). 2. Spasmodic (5 cases). 3. Degenerative (9 cases). 1 ' Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,' vol. Ixi.

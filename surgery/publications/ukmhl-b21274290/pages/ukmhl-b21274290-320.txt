216 THE ASPIRATOR IN DISTENDED URINARY BLADDER. peringeal incision^ tlie stricture being divided or not at tlie time of operation as required by the conditions of the case or in accordance with, the custom of the operator. 3. The aspirator can be used only with some risk in cases of retention where there is reason to believe that the urine is foul^ unless the means are at hand by which an antiseptic solution may be introduced into the bladder before the withdrawal of the needle. Even under these circumstances it is only applicable to cases in which the retention is due to prostatic enlargement where there has been no long-continued previous suffering from cystitis, irritable bladder, or vesical atony ; such cases being more appropriate for treatment by prostatotomy and perinaeal drainage. 4. In cases of retention, from any cause whatever, where it is probable that the bladder walls are diseased, or the urine foul, if the surgeon decide to tap the bladder instead of performing the major operation, the paracentesis should be done with a large trocar and canula, and not with a fine aspirator needle, for reasons already stated. 5. In the event of an attempt at aspiration being fol- lowed by pain and rigidity, with or without vomiting or nausea, lasting for twelve or fifteen hours, the good of the patient would be best consulted by free incision above the pubes, and drainage of the bladder through the perinseum at the same time, if the urethral or prostatic obstruction be impassable by catheter.

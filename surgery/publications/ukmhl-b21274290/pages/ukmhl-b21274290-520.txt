412 MULTIPLE GANGRENE OF THE SKIN ration takes place beneath it^ and often a pustular border with a red areola is formed, the whole resembling a vaccination pustule, the process extending both in depth and peripherally ; a black slough is formed from a quarter to an inch or more in diameter, the smaller ones, still with a pustular border and areola : after attaining a certain size, varying much, the process of separation sets in, and when completed, a sharp-edged, roundish or oval conical ulcer is formed deep or shallow, in proportion to the diameter of the slough, some of the largest being quite three quarters of an inch in the centre. Extension of the ulcer seldom takes place after the separation of the slough has commenced. When the lesions are closely aggregated coalescence will probably ensue and then very large ulcers, irregular both in contour and floor, are produced. If any fresh crops are formed, or when it commences after most, if not all, of the varicella lesions have cleared off, perhaps a fortnight or more from the onset, or in cases following vaccination, or otherwise unconnected with varicella, the ulcerative lesions usually commence on the lower half of the body. They especially affect the buttocks and thighs, as apin's-head sized papulo-pustule, which extends to the size of a pea or larger, ruptures, and, except on the buttocks or wherever it is kept moist, dries in the centre to a scab, with the pustular border and red areola like vaccinia, and from this point follows the same course as those which started in a varicella pustule. In some cases the buttocks and parts in contact with the napkin, and sometimes the legs and the thighs, are fairly riddled with ulcers of all sizes, shapes, and depths. On the trunk and rest of the body they are not usually numerous, and though some may be very large and deep the majority are comparatively superficial. Where the lesions are numerous and deep there is naturally much constitutional disturbance, the temperature ranging up to 104Â° or even higher. Lung complications, tubercular, pyaemic, or inflammatory, are very frequent, and determine or hurry on the fatal issue. Should the

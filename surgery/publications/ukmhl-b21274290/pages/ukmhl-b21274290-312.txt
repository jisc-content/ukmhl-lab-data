208 THE USE OF THE ASPIRATOR AS A MEANS OF proceeding when repeated, being associated with a refer- ence to tlie fatal case recorded by Dr. Mackie Williams in the ' British Medical Journal' for February 21st, 1880. Personally I have long thought, and indeed have been in the habit of teaching, that the operation, trivial as it may appear in itself to be, is open to serious objections, and may be connected with grave risk, for it has always seemed to me that the production of a distinct breach of surface in the walls of a distended bladder, by the intro- duction of a needle, however fine, the organ being one of great elasticity and muscular power, would directly tend to a giving way of the coats at the point of puncture, unless an immediate and decided relief of tension could he effected hy a free and rapid flow of urine from the needle^ and that even if no actual rupture were to occur there may be a liability under similar circumstances to an oozing of urine through the wound by the side of the instrument. This liability would be increased by the spasmodic con- traction which the act of puncture would probably excite in the bladder walls. In aspiration by means of a fine needle, this immediate relief of tension does not, in my opinion, appear to be sufficiently decided to obviate the risks alluded to, since the flow of urine is of necessity slight, seeing that the canal of the needle is of so small a size. Herein there lies, I believe, a strong objection to the operation in many cases. With reference to the question of vesical tension, I may perhaps say that I have been for some time watching with considerable care the immediate effect upon the con- traction of the bladder coats, produced by the introduction of instruments per urethram as well as through the walls of the viscus, and, so far as I am able to judge, the follow- ing conclusion, based partly on the sensations of intelligent patients, and partly upon careful observation of the force of the expelled stream of urine, may be taken as fairly accurate. The introduction of a catheter or canula into a bladder

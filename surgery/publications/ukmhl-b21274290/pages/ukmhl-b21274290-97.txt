fKESlDENT^S ADDEESS. Cooper Forster had retired with ttmple means from pro- fessional work. John Cooper Forster was born in Lambeth on the 13th November^ 1823. He was a son of Mr. John Forster_, who practised for many years in that neighbourhood. He was educated at King's College School^ and subsequently entered at Gruy's Hospital. He passed through a distinguished career as a student; graduated as Bachelor of Medicine in 1847 at the University of London^ and was placed second in honours,, with gold medal, in Surgery, and also second in honours in Midwifery. He was one of the first among consulting surgeons who availed himself of the University of London Degree. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1849. In 1855 he was appointed Assistant Surgeon to Guy's Hospital, and continued so to act till 1870, when he became Surgeon on the retirement of Mr. Hilton. An opportunity soon offered itself to test his judgmewt and qualities as an operator, and he proved himself equal to the occasion.^ The facts are of so much importance as bearing on the advance in this country of the operative surgery of the abdomen, that I make no apology for referring to them. A patient came under the care of Dr. Habershon^ in Guy's Hospital, with symptoms of obstruction of the oeso- phagus, which in the course of some few weeks became so complete that it was manifest the patient would be starved^ unless some measure of relief could be afforded. Conse- quently Mr. Cooper Forster was consulted, and he at once decided to open the stomach. With regard to the operation and operator Dr. Habershon's words are the best commen- tary : " The skill with which the operation was executed, the scientific coolness and care displayed, and the manner in which it was brought to a successful termination, all who witnessed the operation can confirm.''^ Mr. Forster 1 Letter from Dr. Wilks. - 'Guy's Hospital Reports,' 3rd series, vol. iv, 1858.

OVAEIOTOMY. 51 Case 471.—The last death in the series I will take next, because it has the common feature of suppuration of parotid glands. It was a case of ruptured, semi-solid tumour, with an immense quantity of ascitic fluid and chronic peritonitis. The patient had septicsemic symptoms before I operated, dark vomit having been troublesome, with a feeble-running pulse. She did badly from the first, and died with suppuration of both parotid glands, death coming rather suddenly at last, with rapid rise of temperature as in the previous case. I doubt if anything but earlier operation would have altered the result. Case 204 was another one due to rupture of a degene- rating semi-solid tumour into the peritoneum, in a feeble elderly woman; and I think, from watching her condition, that the use of the drainage-tube might possibly have saved her. Case 428 was a clear case of septicaemia, and I am equally clear that I ought to have used the drainage-tube. There was a quantity of broken-down lymph and clot in the pelvis, and it was very foetid. I did not put in a tube because everything seemed so dry and clean after sponging out. I am certain, however, that in every case in which foetor is present, the wise course is to use the tube. These septicsemic cases must be considered as among the preventible fatalities, and I will take next another group belonging to the same class. Hsemorrhage. Case 304.—A simple ovariotomy, complicated by the removal of a small, unhealthy, adherent ovary from the opposite side. This had to be regularly scraped out, and there was free oozing at the time from a largish surface. I did not see the patient after the operation, but she died in twenty-nine hours with symptoms which would have led me to reopen the wound and look for haemorrhage, had I been sent for.

91 EARLY DISSEMINATED MYELITIS. the one under discussion may not be regarded as a middle term between two clinically well-recognised spinal sequelae of acute specific diseases. The first group^ originally described by Westphal/ comprises cases which present symptoms very like those of multiple sclerosis^ the said symptoms being definite sequelae of smallpox and typhoid. To this group there have been added by subsequent observers more or less similar cases accompanying or fol- lowing measles,, scarlet fever^ pneumonia, ague.^ It has been cautiously suggested by Westphal in one of his papers that a slighter degree of mischief than that found in his cases of fatal disseminated myelitis might have given rise to changes which eventuate in something resembling multiple sclerosis. The second group of spinal sequelae of fevers to which I refer comprises cases resembling infantile paralysis. Westphal is very careful to emphasize that in his first case of disseminated myelitis there was no damage to the great ganglion-cells, and the same fact obtains with regard to the case under discussion. But it is easy to understand how such a vascular storm as we have pictured before us, if a little more localized in the anterior horns, might have swept away a number of ganglion-cells and thus induced atrophy of separate groups of muscles in relation to them. Of such atrophies, in every respect resembling infantile paralysis, we have a fair number of cases on record as sequels of the acute specific diseases. 1 ' Archiv fiir Psychiatrie/ Bd. iii, 1872, p. 376. ^ For further cases and for bibliography of this group of nervous sequelse (in which symptoms resemble the clinical type of multiple sclerosis), vide Whipham and Myers, ' Clin.

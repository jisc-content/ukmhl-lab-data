ANEURISM AT THE EOOT OF THE NECK. 292 This is too well known to need description ; it is enougli to say tliat the details were very strictly carried out. On November I3tli, having latterly become restless and sleep- less at night, and his resolve to submit to the restraint imposed beginning to fail, his midday meal was increased by 5j of solid and 5j of fluid ; and on December 2nd a further increase of ^ss of solid and ^ss of fluid was sanc- tioned ; his diet at the latter date then consisted of buttered bread ^Ij with milk ^ij for breakfast, the same solids with the same quantity of milk Or wine in the even- ing, and of of meat, boiled fish and bread, with of milk for dinner. This continued to be his diet allowance until January 23rd of this year, when at his urgent wish he was allowed to return to his home in a suburb of London. A daily report of his progress during the above time would be very tedious to read, and it is not necessary. Within a few days the pulsation of the aneurism was found to have become less forcible, some decrease in the size of the swelling was observed, and some firmness sug- gestive of the formation of clot was noticed ; the pain also had abated so much that he spoke of it as being quite bearable, and occasionally absent for a short while. His nights, on the whole, were better than for several previous weeks, although he was sometimes roused by the collection of mucus in his throat, which he could not easily expel. The patient was intelligent; he fully realised his condi- tion, and the marked relief of pain and the other signs of improvement made him for a time very docile; but the improvement did not continue, and with slight fluctuations in its rate the swelling enlarged, and pain increased. With this he lost heart, he became intolerant of restraint, and requested his discharge. At that date (January 23rd) the right common carotid artery, which before could be easily felt and even seen pulsating as it ascended upon the inner and anterior border of the swelling, was traceable only as a band in which none or an extremely feeble pulsation was discover-

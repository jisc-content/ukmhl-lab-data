ACUTE TUBERCULAR ULCERATION OF THE ]s'AUCES. 99 There had been a considerable degree of fever, and he perspired much during sleep. After this there was nothing further calling for notice ; the fever and emaciation continued, and no satisfactory examination of his throat or chest was possible; his voice was reduced to a mere whisper. He died on July 29th. At the post-mortem examination, the whole of the pharynx was found to be extensively but superficially ulcerated, the ulceration extending to both aspects of the soft palate, and into the thyroid pouches ; below it ceased at the oesophagus. The base of the tongue showed super- ficial erosion. The epiglottis was very thin, and the mucous membrane of the larynx above the cords was extensively ulcerated ; the cords were healthy. A large abscess-cavity was found beneath the jaw on the left side extending round to the back of the pharynx. Both lungs were studded throughout with tubercles, the tracheal and bronchial glands were enlarged and caseous. From the middle of the jejunum to the ileo-csecal valve the small intestine showed most extensive ulceration, some of the ulcers completely encircling the gut; the large in- testine was healthy. The mesenteric glands were enlarged and caseous, and several of them had broken down. No tubercles were found in the other viscera; the liver was somewhat fatty. Although in these two latter cases no microscopical ex- amination of the pharynx was made, we do not think there can be the slightest doubt that the ulceration was tubercular. We have ventured to bring these cases before the Society, not so much in respect of their rarity, which we believe to be more apparent than real, but because the subject of acute pharyngeal tuberculosis has received scant notice in this country. The only cases we have met with in English medical literature are those described by Dr. Gee in the 7th and 11th volumes of the ^ St. Bartholo- mew's Hospital Reports,"' and those mentioned by Dr.

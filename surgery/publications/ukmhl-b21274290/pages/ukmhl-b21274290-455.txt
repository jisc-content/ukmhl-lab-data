351 PORTIONS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE. tLat knot tlie needle is cut away entirely, one long tliread will be left passing through the last opening made. When the last loop comes to be tied, this is done, and the loop is formed by tying one end of this thread to the corresponding end of the first, which, it will be re- membered, was left on beginning the suture (Fig 4). The loop thus formed is drawn up, and knotted securely on the opposite side, thus closing the bowel. Fig. 4. A. First thread united with last to form the last loop. B. Reunited intestine presenting at level of abdominal wall. C. Abdominal wound. It will be seen that it is possible to finish the suture entirely in this way, leaving almost no point of the stitch in sight; but in practice it is often more satisfactory, after the last loop is tied, to introduce one Lembert suture, so as more evenly to close the final opening. This stitch is made with gut, as its use is merely temporary, and absorption of it is desired.

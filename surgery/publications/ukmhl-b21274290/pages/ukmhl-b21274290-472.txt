368 THE RELATION OF A CERTAIN FORM OF only occasional and existing for a short time, so long as tlie kidneys remain undegenerated ? I should not now endorse the latter part of this_, as I think we have at hand a better explanation of retention than any degeneration of the kidneys could afford; though no doubt where the kidneys eventually undergo degeneration this does not improve matters. And Prof. Latham/ in his Lectures on the Pathology of Rheumatism, Gout, and Diabetes," kindly notices my question quoted above, and in reply to it says, Certainly; and in persons whose sympathetic ganglia have this sensitive constitution the causes which lead to the formation of uric acid will develop an attack.''^ In conclusion, I think that this relation between the headache and the excretion of uric acid (viz. that there is diminished excretion of uric acid before and increased excretion during the headache; but that taking the two periods together there is no absolute increase in the excretion of uric acid, or alteration in its normal relation to the urea) will be found to hold good for all cases of headache which are influenced by diet in the way I have described; and further that the fluctuations in excretion here noticed may help us to clear up several important points in the pathology of gout and other diseases con- nected with uric acid ; more especially by showing the way in which temporary retention of uric acid may be brought about, and in strengthening the hypothesis that in gout there may be more or less permanent diminution of the alkalescence of the blood, resulting in a chronic or constantly recurring retention of uric acid. I must express my regret that I can only bring forward the results in a single case; but these results are so definite and complete in themselves that I think I have good ground for the deductions I have made from them ; while the difficulty in obtaining anything like the same facilities for examining the urine of other people is obvious; and though several friends and fellow-sufferers have kindly promised me samples of urine collected with 1 ' Brit.

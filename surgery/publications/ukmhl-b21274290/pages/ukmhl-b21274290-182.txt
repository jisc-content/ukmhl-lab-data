86 EAELY DISSEMINATED MYELITIS. cord, for in both anterior and posterior nerve-roots the vessels are mucli engi^rged. No changes have been fonnd in the nerve-cells, fibres, or supporting tissues of the cord, and staining by Gram's, and the ordinary methods, has failed to demonstrate the presence of micro-organisms. In the medulla oblongata the changes are very similar to those in the cord^ except that no haemorrhages have been seen. The stress seems to have fallen chiefly on the hypoglossal and vagus nuclei, and, from the sections which have been made, would appear to have been greater on the left than on the right side. Gommentary. There could be no doubt during life that this patient was suffering from measles, and within a fortnight of his admission a comrade of his who slept in the same room at the police station was admitted to the London Fever Hos- pital also suffering from measles, which he passed through without complication. Also the post-mortem appearances and the microscopic examination establish, I think, without doubt the existence of early myelitis. The changes were, as Dr. Penrose has demonstrated, vascular in character, and they had led to such damage to the cord that in one part it was diffluent and in other parts there was red softening. The myelitis was of the disseminated form, for the lesions found were not along systematic lines but varied in intensity and distribution at different levels and in different regions of the cord. The retention of urine, the paralysis of lower limbs, and paresis of upper limbs, the paralysis of intercostals, the absence of knee-jerks and of plantar reflexes, were all spinal symptoms; and it seems probable that the pain down the breast bone and at the epigastrium, which was complained of by the patient even before the rash appeared,

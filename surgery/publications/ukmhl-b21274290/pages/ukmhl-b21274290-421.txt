WEITERS' CRAMP AND IMPAIRED WRITING POWER. 317 found manifesting these three conditions, and that the affected muscles are precisely those upon which the pro- longed strain of the act has mainly fallen. Dr. Waller has shown that in fatigue induced by over-stimulation of a nerve, at death, and after nerve section, it is at the motor end-plate (the junction between nerve and muscle) that conduction is first interrupted. Dr. Reid, working with Dr. Waller, has shown that when stimulation takes place from the brain, failure of conduction occurs first in the cord where the ganglionic cell forms a junction between the fibre of the pyramidal tract and the fibre of the anterior nerve-root. Dr. Waller has also found that muscle, the nerves of which have degenerated, is more rapidly exhausted than normal muscle, a statement which finds some clinical con- firmation at p. 310 of this paper, where I stated that " it is possible that fatigue in a muscle is produced with undue readiness when the voluntary motor stimulus is impeded at any point.^^ This is because, as is well known, when a block occurs in the motor path, degeneration of the nerve takes place in the parts beyond the obstruction. Finally, a few words may be added as to the treatment of conditions of impaired writing power. Clearly to talk of a cure for writers^ cramp is about as rational as to talk of a cure for lameness. The first step towards treatment is diagnosis. It seems needless to insist on the necessity of rest, or to enter at all fully into methods of treatment discussed in my previous paper. It is necessary to state that the great majority of the patients whose cases are recorded in the present paper were seen by me only once or twice, so that where no record is made of the result of treatment it must be inferred that the result is not known. The results, where known, were as follows : No. 76 (possibly due to lead) is reported as improved somewhat after a ten weeks' use of the galvanic cur- rent.''

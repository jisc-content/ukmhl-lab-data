172 INDURATION IN THE PEIMAEY The characters of induration^ as found in the primary- sore in women, may now be considered as exemplified in the cases included in this table^ and its peculiarities in the sex described. In the male sex induration is de- scribed as being always or nearly always present, and in a well-marked form, circumscribed and confined to the base of the sore, sharply defined in its boundary, fre- quently assuming a remarkably characteristic form and peculiar density and hardness, like a ring of cartilage set in the surrounding soft tissues. From a consideration of the cases whence these notes are derived it is found that there are many interesting peculiarities of the induration of the primary sores in women which contrast with these points in men. First, as to the degree of the development of the induration or its quantity. It is stated as a general fact that in women it is less marked and less abundant than in men. These observations substantiate the truth of this in a large proportion of cases, but tend to show that it is not the minimum amount only that occurs in women, but that, whilst in a large proportion the degree is slight, in a good many cases a maximum amount of induration is reached; in fact, there is the greatest latitude in this respect, the induration varying from large tumour- like masses or wide-spread patches to cases where it is with the greatest difficulty tangible or visible. Be- tween these extremes every degree is met with. As to the proportion of the cases in which induration is well- or ill-marked it will be found on reference to the table (A) that, roughly estimated, in one third of the cases it was much developed, in another one third it was moderately so, and in the remainder it was so slight as to be appre- ciable with difiiculty or not at all. As illustrations of the large development of the indu- ration may be cited Case 111, where the sore formed a hemispherical swelling as large as half a Tangerine orange, set upon the outer surface of the labium ; and Case 136, in which there were two primary sores, one of which

WRITERS^ CRAMP AND IMPAIRED WRITING POWER. 309 (153^ 162), and one (140) had had his right hand smashed in a mangle twelve years previously. Creaking of the right shoulder occurred in 3 cases, 9 are noted as being dyspeptic, gouty, or alcoholic. Tremor was noted in 18 cases. In 11 cases there was disability in acts other than writing. The previous duration was for the most part consider- able, in only 3 cases was it less than a year. In the whole 66 cases of the neuro-muscular group the previous dura- tion was less than a year in 11, or 16*6 per cent. In sub-group A the previous duration was less than a year in 6, or 46 per cent. In sub-group B the previous duration was less than a year in 5, or nearly 24 per cent., and In sub-group C the previous duration was under a year in 3, or 9*4 per cent. It is dangerous to form conclusions on averages of small numbers, but these figures point in the direction that some time is, as a rule, necessary for the production of change in muscular irritability. In the whole series of cases in both papers we find that of the muscles whose irritability was found altered : The interossei were affected seventy-nine times. Abductor and opponens pollicis twenty-eight times. Extensors of thumb twenty-three times. Flexors of thumb thirty-two times. Muscles of little finger nine. And other muscles only rarely and exceptionally. In the present series of 93 cases nerve-tenderness (N. T.) was noted fifty times, and in the subjoined table its distribution in the groups and its association or other- wise with altered muscular irritability (A. M. I.) is shown. ATT 1 A T I N.

OBSTRUCTION OF ONE URETER BY A CALCULUS. 249 2nd. That irritation in such a diseased kidney (aided^ perhaps^ by the presence of some morphia in the system) may cause absolute suppression of urine lasting for a week_, similar to that caused by mechanical obstruction, and not resembling that which occurs in the course of Bright's disease. And it is interesting to note : 3rd. That in this instance the whole of the ureter was dilated, although the stone was lodged half-way down it. Appendix. The distinction between non-obstructive and ohsti'uctive suppression of urine was first clearly pointed out by Sir William Roberts/ and is lucidly explained by the late Dr. Hilton Fagge.^ Non-obstructive suppression, which occurs in acute Bright's disease, the later stages of chronic Bright's disease, in certain acute fevers, in the algide stage of cholera, and after instrumentation of the urethra, when the kidneys are diseased and perhaps in other con- ditions, is usually fatal if unrelieved in two or three days, and though it is impossible to give a clear account of the symptoms caused by it which shall fit all cases, it may be said to be characterised by headache, vomiting, the rapid onset of unconsciousness, and what are known as urgemic symptoms, while any urine that may be passed is either bloody or highly albuminous, and there is often more or less anasarca. In obstructive suppression which follows the complete blocking of both ureters,^ the patient, instead of dying within a day or two, goes on for seven or eight days without any other grave symptoms, so that both he him- self and his relations find it easy to imagine that there 1 ' Roberts on the Urine,' 3rd edition, pp. 24 and 26. ^ Fagge's * Principles and Practice of Medicine,' 1886, vol. ii, p. 387. 3 Dr. Fagge, loc. cit.

IN INFANTS AND ITS CAUSES. 403 On opening the body^ the pleurae were healthy, the lungs were consolidated at both bases, especially on the right side, and much congested, and there were one or two tubercles in both lungs. The bronchial glands were about the size of an almond and caseous. The liver was enlarged and fatty, the mesenteric glands were large and infiltrated with tubercular deposit; all the other viscera were normal. As the above account is somewhat meagre, Dr. Barlow has been kind enough to supplement it from a few brief notes of his own. Some of the lesions on the scalp had ulcerated so deeply tliat there was a thin horny floor which was firmly adhe- rent to the subjacent bone, but the bone was not actually bare." In the thorax, the bronchial glands were caseous and enlarged, the lungs were emphysematous in front, and tha lower lobes at the back showed extensive areas of broncho- pneumonia which had become partially caseous. On the under surface of the upper lobes were some groups of undoubted miliary tubercle. There was a small vomica almost certainly due in part to softening of one of the bronchial glands which penetrated into the root of the lung at the lower lobe on one side, and close to it was another caseous gland. The mesenteric glands were en- larged and caseous, and in the intestines some of the Peyer^s patches showed small deposits of tubercle with very early commencing ulceration." I have four other cases in which there is no reason to believe that varicella had any connection with the ulceration. In one of these (Case 3) the eruption was bullous and may be considered to belong to a different category, but at all events there was deep ulceration and no sign of varicella, and I therefore record it here. In Case 4 the evidence against a varicella connection is very strong, I should say conclusive, and in Case 5, a severe and fatal one, not only did it begin on the lower extremities, but the mother averred that she was acquainted with chicken-

RICHTER'S HERNIA OE PARTIAL ENTEROCELE. BT FREDERICK TREVES. F.R.C.S., SURGEON TO, AND LECTUEEB ON ANATOMY AT, THE LONDON HOSPITAL. Received July 12thâ€”Read December 14th, 1886. The variety of strangulated hernia with which the present paper deals has attracted but little attention in this country. In the majority of English text-books it receives no notice, and in those treatises in which it is men- tioned it is usually disposed of in a few lines. The hernia is rare, but not so rare as to be merely a curiosity. The only two specimens of it that exist in the museum of the College of Surgeons were recently presented by myself, and yet, on the other hand, I have collected over fifty recorded instances of this peculiar lesion. The main features of the hernia are these. A part only of the circumference of the bowel is engaged and strangulated in the hernial orifice; the involved segment may rapidly pass into gangrene, and yet the lumen of the gut remain free; the portion snared projects from the surface of the intestine as a small, rounded, bud-like diverticulum.

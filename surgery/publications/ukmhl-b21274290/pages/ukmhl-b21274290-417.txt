WKITERS' CRAMP AND IMPAIRED WRITING POWER. 313 I have noticed great nerve-tenderness in cases of lead palsy and in cases of muscular atrophy, but without any other evidence of neuritis. In true neuritis of a mixed nerve we find not only nerve- tendernessj but changes in sensibility, neuralgia, causalgia, trophic change, muscle wasting, and often distinct evidence of swelling of the nerve involved. In chronic rheumatic conditions and in gout the nerve- trunks are often tender, and this without any good evi- dence that they are irritated by thickenings or bony out-growths. Nerve-tenderness may certainly be produced by exces- sive muscular exertion. I have seen such a condition in laundresses, who state that they have strained the arm from wringing clothes, and also in men who have made excessive muscular effort, and notably in one gentleman whose musculo-spiral nerve had become excessively tender from prolonged use of a heavy fishing-rod. In some of my cases the nerve-tenderness was associated with dyspepsia and alcoholism. Mr. Barker's case (No. 77) may be again alluded to. In this patient all the nerve-trunks of the arm were very tender before the removal of the pressure on the brachial plexus, but after the successful operation this tenderness quickly disappeared. From this resume it appears, therefore, that nerve- tenderness may, in regard to its cause, be 1. Functional (neuralgia). 2. Central. 3. Peripheral. 4. Due to cold. 5. Due to rheumatism. 6. Due to inflammation (neuritis). 7. Due to muscular exertion. 8. Toxic (lead, alcohol, gout). In my case of impaired writing power the median nerve has most often been found to be tender. Muscular failure is most often evident in the muscles of pen-prehension and

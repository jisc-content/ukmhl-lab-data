ANEURISM OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. 275 adopted and render the epithet "inaccessible/'' hitherto frequently employed with regard to aneurisms thus situated for the future an unjustifiable one. BemarJcs hy Mr. Henry Morris.â€”There was no diffi- culty in exposing to view the aneurism sufficiently for the purpose of introducing the cannula. Whether in another case this would be accomplished better by drawing down the stomach or by drawing up the transverse colon and omentum will depend upon the precise situation of the aneurism and the nature of the adhesions round about it. The great difficulty attending the operation was the management of the wire. We had thought it desirable to have the wire coiled upon a long and very slender rod so that there should be a strong disposition for it to regain its twist and so occupy but a small space within the aneurism. This difficulty could be greatly diminished or altogether removed by having the wire wound upon a reel which could be held in the right hand of the operator within the abdominal cavity, and thus the wire could be paid off the reel directly into the mouth of the cannula.

EESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY AS TO THE BEST METHOD OF EESTORING THE CANAL AFTER EEMOYING PORTIONS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE. BY E. STANMOEE BISHOP, F.E.C.S. (CoMMrNiCATED BY SIR SPENCER WELLS.) Received February 5tliâ€”Read May lOth, 1887. I DESIRE, in tlie first place, to express my satisfaction ait being, by the courtesy of Sir Spencer Wells and your kind permission, enabled to bring my experiments and their results forward this evening, and, in the next place, to explain as far as I can the object with which these experiments have been performed and the results so far obtained. And to clear the way I start with four propositions. 1. Union of the intestine is peculiar in this^ that in no other tissue is it so imperative that absolute and perfect apposition should be obtained and maintained until organic union has taken place in every part. Anything less than this may result in a leakage, septic peritonitis, and death.

president's address. 34 mander of the Royal Military Order of Christ of Portugal, and Knight Commander of the Order of Isabella la Catholica of Spain. He was a man of much general information, was well read, and of good conversational powers; of a retiring dis- position, but a courteous gentleman, and professionally most honorable and straightforward. He might truly be said to have been a man without guile, so simple, true, and honest was he in all his views and actions in life. Mr. Greorge Graskoin was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1851. He communicated two papers to our ^Transac- tions.' He was never married, and had retired from practice a short period prior to his death. About two years ago sym- ptoms of serious cerebral disease manifested themselves, obviously of an incurable character, and although intelli- gence remained intact almost to the last days of his life, he gradually sank, and died last month at the residence of his brother in Wales. Gentlemen, in conclusion, allow me before I sit down to offer my best thanks to the Vice-Presidents and other members of the Council for the kindness and support I have received from them during the past year of office. My thanks are also greatly due to my friends on my right and my left. Dr. Cheadle and Mr. Howard Marsh, for the ease with which my work has been accomplished, both in Council and in this chair. I beg also to express here my best thanks to our active Resident Librarian, Mr. Bailey, for the assistance he has afforded me in collecting informa- tion about those who have been taken from us; and, lastly, to you, gentlemen, I beg to offer my sincere thanks for the kindness with which you have received me on this and all occasions.

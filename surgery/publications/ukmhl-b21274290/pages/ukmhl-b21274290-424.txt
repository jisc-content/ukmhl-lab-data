No mechanical contrivances for throwing the strain of writing on to a new set of muscles is in any sense curative, although this may prove of service in enabling a certain small amount of writing to be done. In the employment of type writers only such are to be recommended as are worked by a key-board. Those which involve the permanent grasping of a handle are often very fatiguing.

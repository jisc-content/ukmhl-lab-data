268 ANEUEISM OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. the left side and below^ overlay, and were incorporated witli, the sac. Seen from the front, the aneurism was trilobate in form, the central portion being the most prominent, and the aorta lying between it and the right lobe. Its diameter, both vertically and trans- versely, measured four inches. At its most prominent part, immediately to the left of the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, there was localised thickening and induration of the sac, which probably corresponded to the seat of the punctures ; and extending vertically downwards from this to the lower boundary of the sac, some dark clot infiltrated the matted tissues reinforcing the sac, due presumably to oozing from the punctures during the operation. The aorta having been opened along its anterior aspect the opening of the aneurism was perceived to be situated entirely on its posterior wall, directed slightly towards the left side and behind the origin of the coeliac axis and superior mesenteric artery; it was oval in form, measuring one inch vertically by five eighths of an inch transversely, and was occluded by dark clot. The aneurism was then removed along with, the last dorsal and three upper lumbar vertebrae, to which it was firmly adherent, and the mass immersed in alcohol for three weeks. A vertical, antero-posterior section having then been made from the centre of the vertebral canal to the most prominent portion of the sac, the progress of extension of the aneurism from its point of origin could be observed {a) backwards, to erode deeply the last dorsal and two upper lumbar vertebrge whilst sparing, to a comparative degree only, the intervertebral discs ; (b) to the right of the aorta for three quarters of an inch, dis- placing the inferior vena cava; (c) upwards for an inch to the upper border of the last dorsal vertebra; [d) down- wards for nearly three inches, to within lialf an inch of the level of the aortic bifurcation; and (e) to the left for a distance of two inches and three quarters. The result of the pressure around the aorta was a marked diminu-

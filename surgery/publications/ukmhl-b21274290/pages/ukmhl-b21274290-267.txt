RICHTBR^S HERNIA OR PARTIAL ENTEROCELE. 163 The mortality in Ricliter^s hernia is, as may be sup- posed_, very high, being represented by 62*2 per cent. It is relatively higher in femoral than in inguinal ruptures. The mortality also after herniotomy in these cases reaches a very high figure. Details upon these points are fur- nished in an appendix to this paper (see pp. 164, 165). This high death-rate depends partly upon the frequency with which gangrene occurs, partly upon the fact that the character of the symptoms often encourages delay or leads to an incorrect diagnosis, and partly upon the diiO&culty of effecting reduction by taxis. In the matter of treatment there is nothing very special to be said. It is evident that these herniae demand early atten- tion. I would urge that no attempt should be made to reduce the protrusion by taxis, but that herniotomy should be performed as soon as the condition is recognised. As an operative procedure herniotomy is at the present day peculiarly simple, whereas taxis involves unusual risk to the gut, and unusual risk of reduction en masse. The sac should, in every instance, be freely opened, and steps taken to secure the protruded bowel before the stricture is I divided. There is, so far as I know, no special point in j connection with the treatment of the gut when gangrenous. One cannot, however, fail to be struck with the frequency 1 with which spontaneous cure has followed in cases which have been practically left to themselves.

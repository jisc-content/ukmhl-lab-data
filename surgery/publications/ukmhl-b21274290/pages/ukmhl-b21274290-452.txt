348 EESTORATION OF THE CANAL AFTER REMOVING the knot is made tlie ends are cut off close. Thus one loop has been formed,, uniting the two bowel walls by their serous surfaces. On the far side of the loop a long single thread is left, passing through the same opening as that passed through by the distal limb of the loop. (This thread is required later in finishing the last loop, and is useful all through the operation as a means whereby the A. First thread left by dividing one of the first two loops. B. Threads which drawn up and tied will form the first loop. C. First loop. D. Left limit of second loop. E. Abdominal wound. bowel may be kept in position at the abdominal wound). On the near side of the loop is another thread attached to the needle, and also passing through the same opening as that which holds the near limb of the loop. Reversing the needle and carrying it again through the walls in the same direction as at first another loop is made, which in Fig. 1.

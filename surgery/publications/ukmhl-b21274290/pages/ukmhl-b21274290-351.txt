OfeSTEUCTlON OF ONE URETER BY A CALCULUS. 247 of pus around the damaged organ ; but the concomitant symptom^ and apparently the result_, was a secretion of highly albuminous urine containing very large numbers of hyaline and granular casts. As soon^ however, as the pus was evacuated, the albumen began to diminish coin- cidently with the fall of temperature, so that in a very few days it was no more than the pus would account for, and the casts had entirely disappeared. On the second occasion there were two factors at work, one the obstruction of the right ureter, and the other the presence of a certain amount of morphia in the system, which, when the left kidney struck work, could only be eliminated by the perspiration and the breath. The result was absolute suppression for nearly a week, not accompanied by the symptoms of ursemic intoxication which are met with in acute Bright's disease, but by those which we are accustomed to associate with some mechanical obstruction to both ureters, i. e., to borrow the term used by Sir William Roberts, there were symptoms of obstructive rather than of non-obstructive suppression. We thought we were justified in assuming that such a cause existed, and it is of the greatest importance to know that this was not the case ; for it is at least probable that if the distension of the right kidney had been relieved by an early incision, the function of the left would have been restored. It was the assumption that the obstruction was mechanical which led us to believe that the damaged kidney was the only one which was functional, and that prevented me from undertaking what would certainly have been a dangerous, and probably, as was then thought, a useless operation. How far the morphia was an active cause of the suppression cannot be accurately estimated, but it is noticeable that, two days after the suppression set in, the patient had remarkably the appearance of a man suffering from opium poisoning, and that the drow- siness and contraction of the pupils certainly appeared earlier than is usual in suppression due to a mechanical cause.

ALCOHOLIC PARALYSIS. 382 of the nerve-fibres are swollen and granular, others shrunken, a large number apparently normal, showing well the axis-cylinder. In longitudinal section also the fibres appear granular; the myelin in many is segmented, and collected in round or oval masses. Right median nerve,—The appearances here are similar in kind to the above ; in degree they are more marked. In addition the nuclear proliferation before referred to is conspicuous in endo- and perineurium, and round the vessels. Right ulnar nerve exhibits precisely the same appear- ances as those found in the last mentioned nerve, and in about the same degree. Right 'phrenic nerve shows no appreciable appearance of pathological change. Right pneumogastric nerve.—A few of the fibres appear degenerated, and there is here and there slight segmenta- tion of the myelin. The spinal iierve roots are sound, both anterior and posterior. Extensor communis digitorum.—The striation of some of the muscle-fibres is indistinct, and some are decidedly granular. There is, perhaps, slight increase in the nuclei of the sarcolemma. The liver shows early cirrhosis and fatty change. My third case, E. C—, a cook, get. 43, is still under treatment, so that the ultimate test in her case cannot be applied ; but if regard be had to the history and symptoms it would scarcely be too much to say that her pathological state, in kind if not in degree, could be predicated with tolerable certainty. She came under my observation on November 5th, 1886. There was a history of rheumatism in two members of her family. She herself had suffered occasionally from winter cough, and two or three years ago had an attack of hgematemesis. She had had two miscarriages in the first two years after her marriage, and one living child subse-

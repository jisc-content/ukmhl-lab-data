276 ANEURISM OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. Another way of obviating it would be to substitute fisbing- gut or borsebair for tbe wire, but the advantage which the wire has over either of these materials is twofold : it coils up within the aneurismal sac, and is therefore less likely to find its way through the opening between the aneurism and the artery, and it can be introduced in one continuous piece instead of presenting a number of ends to be pushed onwards into the sac. There is no doubt that but for the kinking of the wire more of it would have been inserted in this case; but it had never been my intention to introduce more than two feet because I have long held the opinion that for the perfect cure of aneurism the contraction of the sac must follow the coagulation of blood within it. It seeuis to me therefore that one of the points in connection with this mode of treatment as to which it is important that we should obtain information is " what is the smallest quantity of the foreign body which need be introduced to excite the requisite formation of clot ? The smaller the quantity the greater the probability, cseteris jparihus, of a cure, because the contraction of the walls of the aneurism is more likely to be safely and perfectly accom- plished when one foot instead of many feet of wire forms part of the contents of the solidified tumour.

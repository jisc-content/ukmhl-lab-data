304 writers' cramp and impaired writing power. me in another case of left-liandedness not included in this paper, and in whom there was excess of knee-jerk on the right side. In No. 83, who had presumably suffered from infantile hemiplegia, there was observed a faulty development of the right clavicle. Nos. 87 and 88 were left-handed in everything except writing, and it is, per- haps, to be regretted that they were not taught to write well with the left hand instead of badly with the right. In 16 out of the 17 cerebral cases there was a general clumsiness in delicate acts other than writing. There was altered irritability of one or other of the muscles of the right hand in 6 cases. Nerve tenderness was observed in 5 cases, and tremor in 5 cases. Degenerative group.—^23 cases, of which 9 (12,13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 73, 74) belong to the old series and 19 (89 to 102) to the new. Of these 2 (12, 93) were apparently slight cases of disseminated sclerosis, 2 (89, 90) of paralysis agitans, 3 (73, 92, 102) of posterior sclerosis, 2 (94, 97) of lateral sclerosis, 5 (13, 15, 18, 19, 20) of muscular atrophy and fibrillary tremor, 1 (74) was a case of general paralysis, 1 (14) had marked tremor of right hand and foot, 1 (91) showed signs of emotional weakness, was colour blind, but had no change of the discs; 3 (96, 98, 101) had rheumatic thickenings of finger-joints or muscles; 1 (95) was gouty, and 2 (99, 100) were alcoholic. Of these 23 cases 6 had diminution in the faradic irritability of certain muscles, 2 only had nerve tenderness, and in 14 tremor was a marked symptom. In 11 it was noted that there was difficulty in other acts than writing. This and the preceding group embrace 23 cases. Thus rather more than a fourth of the total 168 cases have been referred by me to lesions of the nerve-centres. Neuro-muscular group.—117 cases (51 in the old series, and 66 in the new). This group is formed partly per viam exclusionis, i. e, by the exclusion of cases marked by symptoms which are

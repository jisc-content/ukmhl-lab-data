Out of the 66 cases (of the present series) which fall into the neuro-muscular group, there were 13 in which nerve tenderness existed apart from change of muscular irritability, 21 in which change of muscular irritability existed without nerve-tenderness, 32 in which these sym- ptoms concurred. The neuro-muscular group is thus divisible into three sub-groups. Sdb-Group a.â€”Nerve-tenderness without change in muscular irritability (13 cases). In 12 the right median nerve was tender. In 1 both medians were tender, in 1 all the nerve trunks were tender, in 1 the musculo-spiral and median were tender, and in 1 the nerve-tenderness was very doubtful. Seven cases suffered from gout, rheumatism, dyspepsia, or alcoholism. Four cases had tremor. Three are noted as being crippled in acts other than writing.

In the 9 cases in which this fact is recorded these periods were, eighteen months, thirteen months, twelve months, nine months, six months, two or three months,'^ some weeks,^' a few weeks,'^ one month.

HEADACHE TO THE EXCRETION OF URIC ACID. 359 threatenings of headache occurred. When, however, on the 26th of December I got a decided headache, it occurred to me to separate the urine passed during the headache from that before and after, and I at once got definite results, which were not only exactly repeated in the more severe headache of the 2nd of January, but these latter results showed clearly the diminished excretion before and after the headache, and so served to explain the equivocal results previously obtained. It would take too much space to give all the results of my urinary analysis, so that I shall confine myself to those from the 25th of December onwards, which include the more important of my positive results, and these I have entered in the accompanying table.

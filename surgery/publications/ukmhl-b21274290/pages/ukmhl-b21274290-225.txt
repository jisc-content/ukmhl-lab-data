MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OF ARTERIES. 127 sively destroyed, and the sections consisted rather o£ the products of inflammation than of the normal structures. Sections were made of one of the plugged branches of the middle cerebral, the most distal one being selected.

Embolus (calcareous). The embolus was in parts calcareous, but was surrounded by decolourised clot. The vessel wall, in about three fourths of its circumference, was only slightly infiltrated with cells, and the endothelium was intact. At one part, however, the coats were considerably destroyed, the inner coat being entirely removed, and the muscular coat par- tially ulcerated. At this point the arterial wall was exten- sively infiltrated with cells. Sections of the wall of the aorta taken from one of the aneurismal pouches showed a general disorganisation of the ordinarily dense structure of the vessel, and an infiltration with inflammatory products. The endothelium also was partially destroyed. Sections of the sac of the aneurism on the left external iliac presented precisely similar appearances.

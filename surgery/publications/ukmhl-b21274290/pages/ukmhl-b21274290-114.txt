PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS. 22 and was a Member of tlie Council at the time of liis death. He contributed one paper to the ^ Transactions.' To ^ Guy's Hospital Reports' his communications were numerous and important^ and conspicuous among others^ articles on Chronic Arteritis^ Atheroma, Aneurysm and Insular Sclerosis may be mentioned. He also delivered the Croonian Lectures before the College of Physicians^ which were illustrative of his accuracy of observation and minute investigation of all that related to the subject under consi- deration. It is impossible for me to do justice to the character and work of Walter Moxon. I did not know much of him till of late, and knew nothing of his hospital work. I do not attempt therefore to speak of him from my own knowledge. Walter Moxon was a man of much original mind, of great energy^ of great capacity for work^ of great honesty of purpose^ seeking truth in every subject he took up, and working always for a good purpose. As a lecturer he was clear, impressive, and entertaining; as a teacher, exact, accurate, and convincing. His powers were very considerable, whether as a worker, a teacher, or as a companion. He was a warm-hearted man, generous, and hospitable. A true lover of nature he delighted in all that woods and pastures and running streams could offer for admiration or study. He not only cultivated in his garden every flower or plant that soil and climate would permit, but his daily care was to supply food for the wild birds which frequented his grounds, and which soon learnt to recognise the hand that fed them. One of the most interesting papers from his pen was published in the ^ Medico-Chirurgical Review/ under the title of The Explanation of the Association of Aphasia with Right Hemiplegia." In this paper he put forth the view that the left hemisphere takes the initiative in right- handed persons, whilst the right acts in unison with it, and so under ordinary conditions the left hemisphere controls the organs of speech.

MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OF ARTERIES. 125 Immediately below the bifurcation of the latter vessel, the posterior tibial artery was shrunken and filled with clot, and, at a distance of about balf an inch from its origin, was perforated by a small aperture, similar to that already described in the brachial, and leading into a large swelling in the calf. This swelling contained several ounces of dark and rather soft clot, confined merely by the surrounding tissues, and nowhere very definitely cir- cumscribed. The posterior tibial artery was in no way dilated ; on the contrary, below the spot where it commu- nicated with the collection of clot it was not possible to trace the vessel, and no remains of an embolus were to be found. Vessels of the Left Lower EMremity. The common iliac was healthy. The internal iliac was also healthy, but, relatively to the other vessels, was large. The external iliac in its upper two inches was univer- sally dilated, so as to form an aneurism of globular shape the size of a pigeon's egg. The sac of this aneurism appeared to be composed of all the coats of the vessel except at its most anterior part. Here the sac had partly given way, and the contents were limited by the super- jacent sheath and fascia. The inner surface of the sac was quite smooth, and there was no appearance of athe- roma. The sac contained dark soft blood-clot. There was no laminated fibrin. Below the aneurism the external iliac and the upper part of the common femoral arteries were so contracted that it was difficult to find them. They were not as large as a normal radial, their calibre was practically obliterated, and they contained a slender cord of decolourised fibrin, in which were embedded granules of calcareous material similar to that found in the right common iliac and brachial vessels.

310 WRITERS^ CRAMP AND IMPAIRED WRITING POWER. Of the 50 cases in whicli nerve-tenderness was noted it is to be observed tbat in all but 8 it occurred in the median nerve. I wish to call particular attention to the fact that the muscles in which change of irritability has been most frequently noted (the interossei) are supplied by the ulnar nerve. What is the pathological significance of altered muscular irritability ? We have seen it occurring in every group^ cerebral, degenerative, and neuro-muscular, so that it has no abso- lute value for localising the writing trouble in the brain, cord, nerve, or muscle. It is probable due to some change in the muscle or intra-rauscular nerves, and it seems probable also that such change may be primary or secondary to a lesion in brain, cord, or nerve. This paper is strongly confirmatory of the fact pointed out in the previous paper that depressed muscular irrita- bility in cases of writers' cramp '' is observed more often in the muscles of pen-preJieiision than in those of pen- movement, i. e. in muscles which are subjected to very prolonged contraction and therefore very liable to get over-fatigued. It is possible that fatigue in a muscle is produced with undue readiness when the voluntary motor stimulus is impeded at any point. The man. with cerebral paresis is very conscious of muscular effort when he tries to write, and the same is true of patients in whom the conducting power of the nerves is interrupted by inflammation, con- gestion, or pressure. Case 77 is very instructive on this point. It was that of a boy, aged twelve, in whom a congenital fracture of the clavicle had caused pressure on the brachial plexus. The case was brought before the Clinical Society by Mr. Barker. The boy had peculiar trouble in writing, so that the case had been spoken of as one of writers' cramp. In this case there was very slight but quite obvious wasting (or non-development) of the pectoralis major, and

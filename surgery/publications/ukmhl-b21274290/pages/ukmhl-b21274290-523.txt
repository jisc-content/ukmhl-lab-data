415 IN INFANTS AND ITS CAUSES. partially digested foods, and putting the patient in the best hygienic conditions, offer most chance of success. I desire now (by way of appendix) to call attention to certain local gangrenes of the skin in children, especially of the genitalia and neighbourhood, of which the attending phenomena present some analogies to the cases hitherto considered.

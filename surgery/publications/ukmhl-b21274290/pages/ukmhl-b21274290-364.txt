SUPPRESSION OF URINE. 260 lence^ offensive breatli, and convulsions, and that not more than two ounces of urine had been passed in two days. (3) Treatment.â€”Under the circumstances_, which was the best treatment to pursue ? The diagnosis was far from clear. Had I to deal with a case of complete suppression of urine, brought about by the pressure of a hydrone- phrosis on the renal nervous ganglia ? Had I a case of solitary kidney, and that diseased ? or had I to do with double calculous disease with symptoms chiefly confined to one side ? To discuss these questions with all the details of the case complete, and with the notes of the post-mortem examination before us, would serve no useful purpose. A more interesting issue appears to me to be whether, even with full knowledge of all the details, I could have dealt successfully with the case. This opens up the question whether the small calculus impacted in the ureter could possibly have been removed through an opening in the loin, and whether, therefore, an intra-abdominal operation would not have been better. The latter would have permitted me to discover the dis- organised condition of the left kidney ; also the calculus in the right ureter just at the brim of the pelvis, and possibly to push this calculus back through the enlarged ureter into the pelvis of the kidney. I might also have dealt more successfully with the right kidney, after incis- ing it, had I opened the abdomen, and had eyes as well as fingers to assist me. Finally, it would have demon- strated the absolute infeasibility of removing the right kidney, it being practically a solitary one, a proceeding I might otherwise have contemplated, and which, I think, would have been surgically indicated, in a case where there was an obstruction, more or less complete, in its ureter, which could not be removed.

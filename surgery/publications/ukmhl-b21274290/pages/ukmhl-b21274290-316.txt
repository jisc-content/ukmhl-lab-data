212 THE USE OF THE ASPIRATOR AS A MEANS OF thoroughly washed out, and a large drainage tube in- serted. So much relief followed the operation that the patient immediately rallied, and by the 25th was in a fairly satisfactory condition. The vomiting ceased, the rigidity about the abdomen gradually subsided, the pulse improved, and nourishment was taken well, but in spite of the persistent use of the catheter, all the urine passed through the abdominal wound, which was full of sloughing tissue. On September 30th, therefore, I performed a median cystotomy, introduced a large tube through the wound, and tied it in. By October 4th great improvement had taken place, very little urine was coming from the hypogastric wound, at the bottom of which there still remained a large flabby slough. On October 8th this slough came away, and was followed by a considerable flow of urine. This fact, combined with the appearance of the slough, seemed to indicate pretty certainly that a portion of the bladder itself had become gangrenous. After this date, although there was a con- tinuous full flow of water from the peritoneal tube, a con- siderable stream constantly came from the hypogastric wound. That which came through the perinseum was clear, contained a little blood at times only, and showed but a small quantity of albumen. Upon the evening of October 13th some swelling of the right leg was noticed, and upon examination the ilio- femoral vein was found to be blocked. There was very little pain, but the pulse was quick, and the temperature, which had up to this date varied from 98° to 100°, now rose to 102°. The thrombus soon commenced to clear up, and the swelling of the limb gradually subsided. The general condition of the patient suffered seriously from this com- plication, and great weakness followed, which was much increased by the extreme disinclination of the patient to take food of any kind.

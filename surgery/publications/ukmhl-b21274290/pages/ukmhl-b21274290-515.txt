When it is about an eighth of an inch in diameter the pus dries into a scab ; most of the lesions gradually get well; others, however, especially on the feet and legs, have a pustular border formed round the scab, and this again has an areola, the whole somewhat resembling a vaccinia lesion. This soon ulcerates beneath the scab, forming a sharply punched- out flat-bottomed ulcer, with a ring of inflammation round. Others again are much deeper, a black slough having formed which, after separation, leaves a clean-surfaced but deep ulcer ; or the smaller ulcers may extend periphe- rally and vertically, and then are irregular at the base, though the outline is generally roundish or oval, unless neighbouring lesions have coalesced. There were no ulcerations on the head and face, a few superficial ulcers on the forearms, and one or two on the trunk. On the thigh and buttocks were several of large size, but the ulcerative process was most marked below the knees, those on the feet being the deepest and largest, while the lower third of the leg was fairly riddled with ulcers, varying from a quarter to more than an inch in diameter, and some of them nearly a third of an inch deep. The child was not seen again, having died a few days later in con- vulsions. No post-mortem could be obtained. I have next a series of six cases of varying grades of severity all accompanying or following undoubted vari- cella. The first one was of the most virulent kind. Class 2.—AntecedeAit Varicella, Case 1.—Georgina S—, aet. 7 months. Both father and mother were syphilitic. The child was always weakly, and snuffled, but presented no other evidence of syphilis. On October 31st she was unwell ; on November 1st a vesi- cular rash appeared on the head and back which was evi-

AtCOHOLiC MRALYsIS, 878 Areas of fat-cells occur in places between tlie muscular bundles, in wliicb are embedded vessels with thickened walls ; and in one of the sections are seen two fine nerve- twigs cut across, which present the same degenerative appearances, with thickened perineurium and nuclear pro- liferation, as are seen in the larger nerves. Spinal nerve-roots.—These are sound in all regions of the cord. My second case, M. J. P—, was brought into the hospital on November 19th, 1886, unable to walk or even stand. Her age was stated to be 28, although she looked older. She had had three children, one of them stillborn ; had always previously enjoyed fair health, and had been a teetotaller until four years ago. Since then she had been in the habit of drinking heavily, gin being her favourite beverage. Latterly she had been almost continuously intoxicated. There was nothing of importance in the family history. History of present illness.—Her illness was stated by her husband to have come on eight weeks before admission. She then began to feel weak, and to suffer from loss of appetite, losing power in her legs, and staggering in walking. A fortnight later, failure of power in the hands and wrist-drop were observed. She had also wandered in her talk and slept badly. Present state.—On admission she is described as a corpulent woman with florid complexion, tremulous, and coated tongue and offensive breath, complaining of loss of power in legs and hands, with numbness in the legs ; of pains also in the limbs especially on moveruent. She lies in bed on the right side with the legs flexed, and is unable to turn or to extend the legs without assistance. The examination of chest and abdomen shows nothing abnormal except that the heart's sounds are very feeble, and there is some enlargement of the liver. Her voice is feeble, her speech thick, and she has delusions. There is no facial or ocular paralysis and the pupils are normal. When

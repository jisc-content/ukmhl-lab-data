234 TEEATMENT OF EMPYEMA BY PERFLATION. means, and the uncertainty in whicli the operator is left on this score. Solid material may remain behind as well as fluid. To speak of fluids only, injections of any kind, if allowed to stagnate in the pleura, cannot fail to set up or perpetuate irritation. From the patient's point of view, perflation is mechani- cally preferable to fluid injections. It is simple, painless, free from shudders and drenchings, and performed with a minimum of disturbance, and, as far as my experience goes, with practical freedom from danger. Judged by its results in the case narrated above, per- flation seems to possess the following advantages as a method of treatment for empyema : (1) It facilitates the early removal from the chest of putrid residues or of the recent products of inflammation. (2) In the same measure it tends to shorten the period of suppuration ; and (3) To lessen the danger of permanent shrinking of the lung ; and, therefore, also (4) To lessen the necessity for resection of ribs. (5) It leaves the chest relatively dry, and practically free from any foreign material, since air is rapidly absorbed by the pleura. This paper would not be complete without some allusion to the question of the surgical value of local ventilation. Some authorities appear to have seen good results from this form of treatment. Bouisson^ submitted superficial wounds to the direct draught of a bellows for frequent periods of fifteen minutes. A scab usually formed, under which reparative processes advanced more rapidly than under moist dressings or ointments. The same method appears to have been successfully tried by Sir James Simpson. Dr. Ogilvie Wills^ saw wounds treated in this manner unite without one drop of pus. Dr. Kronlein^ devotes an important work to the study of the treatment 1 ' Brit, and Foreign Medico-Chirui'g.

THEEE HUNDEED ADDITIONAL CASES OP COMPLETE OVAEIOTOMY AND TWENTY CASES OE EXPLOEATORY OPERATION. BY J. KNOWSLEY THOENTON, M.B., CM., SURGEON TO THE SAMAEITAN PEEE HOSPITAL. Received April 13th—Read October 26th, 1886. On January llth, 1881^ I had tlie honour to bring before the Eoyal Medical and Chirurgical Society-^ a record of 150 cases of complete ovariotomy^ with twenty-two other cases of abdominal section. I had previously published thirty- eight complete ovariotomies, twenty-five of them having been presented to this Society in a paper read on May 8th, 1877.^ I now present a farther table of 300 cases of complete ovariotomy, with twenty miscellaneous cases. In my previous tables I followed closely the plan of those of Sir Spencer Wells, but in the present series I have thought it well to introduce, in addition to the details in former tables, two columns showing the highest temperatures and quickest pulses recorded after operation, with a note of any special treatment required. In order to do this without making the tables too cumbersome, I have omitted the ' ♦ Med. Chir. Trans.,' vol. Ixiv, p. 141. 2 lb., vol. Ix, p. 297.

MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OF THE ARTEEIES. 136 Common femoral artery,—Guy^s Hospital Museum^ not numbered. In tlie following cases an examination rendered it pro- bable that the artery was ulcerated rather than dilated. This could notj however, be distinctly proved. Common femoral artery.—Guy's Hospital Museum, No. 1519^^ Popliteal artery.—Guy's Hospital Museum, No. 1519^®. Superior mesenteric artery.—Guy's Hospital Museum, No. 1504^^ St. George's Hospital Museum, No. 115. Posterior tibial.—St. George's Hospital Museum, No. 129. The ulceration in the case recorded by us, and in the other cases to which we allude, certainly cannot be the result of a mere mechanical distension, and, in our opinion, affords strong evidence in favour of a specific action of the embolus itself. In conclusion, we beg to submit the following proposi- tions : 1st. Embolism may undoubtedly cause the formation of an aneurism. 2nd. The aneurism is developed at the seat of embolism and not above it. 3rd. The aneurism may be due to an inflammatory softening and consequent dilatation of the artery, or to its ulceration, and the subsequent formation of a sac by the surrounding soft tissues. 4th. Aneurism only occurs when the emboli are derived from a heart, the valves of which are affected by a special form of disease, resulting in the production of fungous growths, and often of ulceration and destruction of the valves themselves.

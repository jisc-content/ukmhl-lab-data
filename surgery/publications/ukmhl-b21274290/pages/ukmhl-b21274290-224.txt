MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OF ARTERIES. 126 The lower part of the common femoral, and the super- ficial and deep femoral vesselS;, were all patent and healthy. A microscopical examination of the diseased vessels revealed the following conditions. Several portions of the right common iliac were examined, including the outer and thinnest part of the vessel where it was most distinctly bulged. The whole arterial wall in contact with the embolus was the seat of an inflammatory process, and, in its whole thickness, was infiltrated with cells. This cell-infiltration was most evident in the inner coat, and in almost every section examined the latter was found to be distinctly ulcerated, Fig. 1.â€”Section of common iliac at the seat of embolism, a.

Where the arterial wall was thinnest this ulceration had entirely penetrated the intima and involved the middle coat. The muscular fibres of the latter had been exten-

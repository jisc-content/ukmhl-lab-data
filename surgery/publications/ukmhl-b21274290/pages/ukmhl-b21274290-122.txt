30. TRESIDENT^S ADDRESS. Convalescent and Surgical Aid Fund" to be called ^''The Chapman Fund.'^ Mr. Chapman was Medical Officer to the Richmond Union Workhouse for upwards of forty years, and the long time he occupied this office was ample evidence of the efficiency and punctuality with which he performed his duties. Mr. Chapman was a member of an old and much re- spected family, long resident in Richmond. His father had been in practice there for many years as an architect and surveyor. He was himself one of a large family, which included a brother, who became the senior partner of that well-known and higlily-respected firm of publishers, Messrs. Chapman and Hall. Towards his latter days he suffered much from pain and local discomfort, which seemed to point to some malignant complication about the bladder or lower bowel. He gradually became emaciated and sank after great and prolonged suffering. He was buried at Petersham, amidst every mark of respect and regret. No one in the place was more loved and respected. His memory will long be cherished as an active and useful member of society, as well as gratefully treasured by all who can testify practically to the value of his professional tact and experience.^ Dr. Edwyn Andrew, of Shrewsbury, became a Fellow of this Society in 1862. He was a student at University College Medical School, and became a Member of the College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1855. He took his M.B. degree in 1856, and became M.D. London, in 1859. In 1866 he became a Master in Surgery and was Gold Medallist in Surgery of that year. He was Resident Medical Officer and House Surgeon at University College Hospital, and also Physician's Assistant. For a short time he held the office of Assistant Surgeon to St. Pancras Infirmary. He was a Member of the Patho- logical and Ophthalmological Societies, President of the Shropshire and Mid-Wales Branch of the British Medical ' Letter from his son, Mr. H. F. Chapman.

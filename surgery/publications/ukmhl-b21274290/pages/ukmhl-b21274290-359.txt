SUPPRESSION OF URINE. 255 30th, when it was found to be considerably less dark in colour. After consultation with my colleague, Dr. Eustace Smith, the swelling in the loin being more tense and painful, I decided on tapping it, and I drew off fifty-five ounces of clear amber-coloured urine ; this was found to contain a considerable amount of albumen; under the microscope plenty of blood-corpuscles were found, but no casts, and no crystals of any kind.

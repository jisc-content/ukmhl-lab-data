ON THE EFFECT UPON THE FEMORAL ARTERY OF ITS LIGATURE FOR THE OUEE OF POPLITEAL ANEUEISM. BY WILLIAM S. SAVORY, F.R.S., SURGEON TO ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL. Received June 8thâ€”Read December 14th, 1886. When the femoral artery is tied at tlie apex of Scarpa's triangle for tlie cure of popliteal aneurism^ what effect is produced on the vessel between the point of ligature and the sac ? In what state is the artery found at a subse- quent period ? Is it pervious or impervious ? With the view of obtaining a satisfactory answer to this question I have examined all the preparations of popliteal aneurism in which the artery had been tied that I could find in the museums of the London hospitals, and the result is set forth in the following table.^ 1 I am greatly indebted to Mr. D'Arey Power for the important help he has given me in examining and describing these oases, and I am glad to have this opportunity of acknowledging it.

130 MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OP ARTERIES. other situation than the valves of the heart. This cal- careous material was certainly not derived from the wall of the vessel itself, for, apart from the fact that calcifica- tion of arteries is never met with at the early age of nine- teen, the vessels in question, as we have already said, were healthy. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, idiopathic ulceration of an artery at a single spot has never been seen except, as we shall presently show, in vessels which have probably been plugged. We therefore conclude that the artery wall was ulcerated at the place where it was plugged, and that the blood, escaping into the surrounding tissues, at first in small quantities, formed a so-called false aneu- rism, without there being any true dilatation of the vessel wall itself. A considerable number of cases are now on record in which aneurisms occurring in young subjects have been associated with aortic valvular disease, and this coinci- dence, together with the situation of such aneurisms at the bifurcation of arteries, has suggested the probability that the disease of the vessels has been the result of their occlu- sion by an embolism. In the great majority of cases no embolism, however, has been actually discovered at the seat of aneurism, although vessels in other parts of the body have been plugged. As far as we are aware, Ponfick is the only writer on this subject who has found an embolus in the diseased vessel itself, and there are yet many surgeons who doubt the direct relationship between embolism and aneurism. The following is a list of arteries in which aneurisms have been found on post-mortem examination and have been attributed to embolism : Axillary.—Guy'& Hospital Museum, No. 1502^°.

writers' cramp and impaired writing power. 319 nerves were exquisitely tender when I saw him, and he was gouty). No. 149 found massage of no use. No. 158 (a rheumatic secretary) was much improved by a course of hot baths_, blistering the tender median nerve, and taking Donovan's solution. No. 159 was much improved by blistering the median nerve and massage, which caused marked increase in the size of the arm. No. 162 was much improved by blistering the median nerve and regulating the bowels. Nos. 163 and 167 were much improved by similar measures. No. 168 was much improved by blistering the median nerve and using the galvanic current. As shown in the above record, the methods of treat- ment which met with a fair measure of success were directed : 1. To the improvement of the general health by diet, regulation of the bowels and the administration of tonics and alteratives (especially arsenic). 2. To applying counter-irritants over painful nerve- trunks wherever they were to be found. 3. To promoting the circulation and nutrition in the affected limb by means of massage, hot baths, and the electric current. It is probable that the mode of action of massage is similar to that of the galvanic current. It will be remembered that I have previously recorded a few cases in which the persistent use of galvanism was productive of great benefit. I have now to record several others in which the employment of massage proved very serviceable. At the same time it must be borne in mind that the paper contains the record of six cases in which massage was of no use. I think I may state conclusively that massage is not useful so long as the nerve-tranks are tender. Indeed, in one or two cases I have seen patients with markedly

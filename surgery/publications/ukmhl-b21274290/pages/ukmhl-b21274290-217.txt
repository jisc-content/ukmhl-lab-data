MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OF ARTERIES. 119 extends also to the inner side of the calf to about four inches below the knee-joint. No pulse can be felt in the tibials of the right side or in the femoral artery of the left side, although it can be easily felt in the left tibial vessels. A small patch of extravasated blood is noticed in front of the right outer ankle. Circumference of the limb over the most prominent part of the aneurism is 13f inches. There is no sign of any similar tumours else- where. The patient was put upon a liberal non-stimulating diet, and confined to her bed. On the first night after her admission into the hospital her temperature rose to 103"4°, but it fell next morning to normal. Three days afterwards she was seen in consultation, when Mr. Langton stated that he believed the aneurisms to be embolic in their origin, and the result of secon- dary changes taking place in the arterial walls from the presence of the emboli. He proposed gentle com- pression of the main vessels above the aneurisms, but not upon the sacs themselves, as they gave the impression of being thin walled, and probably not consisting of the coats of the vessels. Moreover, long delay was not advised, unless manifest improvement resulted, before proceeding to ligature the arteries. In this opinion, both of the nature and the treatment of the aneurisms, he was substantially supported by his colleagues. November 6th,—Pressure was applied to the brachial and the femoral arteries by pads and bandages, the latter being gently continued over the aneurisms. The follow- ing day it was observed that the pad failed to control the pulsation of the popliteal swelling, so a tourniquet was applied very gently. Towards the evening the patient complained of much burning pain in the foot. 9th.—Has a good deal of pain in the arm, but slept well after a morphia draught. Measurement of the pop- liteal aneurism a quarter of an inch smaller, of the elbow tumour a quarter of an inch larger.

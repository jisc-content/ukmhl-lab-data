ALCOHOLIC PARALYSIS. 886 more wasted. Ophthalmoscopic examination of each fundus shows nothing abnormal. 7th.—Patient is much brighter to-day although she rambles in her talk and her speech is rather thick ; the tongue is clean and moist ; the diaphragm acts in respi- ration tolerably well^ as evidenced by epigastric bulging and descent of the liver during inspiration. There is now but little complaint of pain when the limbs are manipu- lated^ but the dropping of the hands and feet is as well marked as ever. She complains of no discomfort and says she feels better. Urine and faeces are sometimes passed in bed. She has the delusion that she gets up every day and walks in the ward. llth.—Mentally she is clearer now. Sensation of pain on pinching the skin of the legs is acute. There is some rigidity of the adductor muscles of the thighs; she lies with the knees pressed together. The pupils are mode- rately dilated and act sluggishly to light. 15th.—The extensors of the forearm are stronger. She is able to bring the hand above the horizontal line of the forearm when the hands are held out^ and she can slowly pronate and supinate both hands. She can turn in bed without assistance, and does not now pass urine or motions in bed. 1 7th.—Electrical examination of right leg made to-day shows that the peroneal and sural groups of muscles all act to moderately strong faradism. Galvanism : Extensor longus A.C.C. {fx 4) = C.C.C. Gastrocnemius A.C.C. 6) > C.C.C. Peronei A.C.C. 5) = C.C.C. In all cases the contraction is feeble_, slow_, and wave- like ; the degenerative reaction is less marked than on first examination. The examination and necessary manipula- tion of limbs now cause no pain. There is a red line on the gums close to the margins of the teeth ; the tongue is clean and moist, but of a deep red colour, and somewhat glazed.

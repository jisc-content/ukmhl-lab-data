105 ACUTE TUBERCULAR ULCERATION OF THE FAUCES. earlier stages; in the later ones^ the rapid melting down and the deep ulceration should suffice to characterise it. The general symptoms should also be taken into consider- ation, and it would then be hardly possible that a mistake should be made. Believing as we do that the condition is only a part of general tuberculosis, the prognosis is absolutely unfavour- able. There is little to be said as to treatment. The general treatment would of course be tonic and supporting, but the dysphagia renders it very difficult to do much. Mackenzie recommends insufflations of morphia to relieve the pain, and we are inclined to think that cocaine spray might be used cautiously with a view to rendering possible the thorough application of iodoform, a trial of which is certainly indicated by its success in tubercular ulceration in other parts of the body. Grougenheim has reported a case where chronic tubercular ulcerationof the fauces in a patient who presented no other sign of tuberculosis was thus cured. We think our cases entirely bear out Dr. Gee^s conclu- sions : " First, that there is a form of angina which must be called tuberculous, and which forms a part of general tuberculosis ; and next, that there is a form of tuberculosis which may be called anginal, inasmuch as during life the chief symptom relates to the fauces.^^ (For report of the discussion on this paper, see * Proceedings of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society,' New Series, vol. ii, p. 150.)

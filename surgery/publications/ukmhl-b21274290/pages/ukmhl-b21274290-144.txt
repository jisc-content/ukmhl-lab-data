OVARIOTOMY. 52 Case 396 died from exhaustion some days after a very- severe haemorrhage. I opened the abdomen and found that the inner loop of the transfixing ligatures had slipped (the only time I have ever seen this accident happen, it being always the outer loop which is the danger) ; the haemorrhage was easily stopped, but she had lost an enormous quantity of blood and never rallied. Case 401 was also a new experience in the matter of haemorrhage. It was a case in which a very difficult double enucleation was performed, and the oozing was very free and difficult to check at the time; but when I closed the abdomen I thought that all was safe. Symptoms of liaemorrhage, however, appeared, and I re-opened the wound, and then found it absolutely impossible to check the haemorrhage that was going on from a very large surface. Diarrhoea and exhaiistAon. I think the only fatal case which I should consider really preventible, was one which died from the exhaustion of diarrhoea. Case 438 was practically convalescent, but had slight looseness of the bowels, which I did not consider sufficiently, and she was moved into the convalescent ward at the week^s end as usual. In the night diar- rhoea became very violent, and the nurse, a new hand, did not attempt to check it, or seek any help, and at the morning visit I found the patient blue, cold, and collapsed, and she died in a few hours. Shoch. Cases 200 and 353 were both due to shock, both were ruptured dermoids, and both were, I think, hopeless under any conceivable management. The former was barely placed in bed alive, and the latter only lived a few hours.

134 MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OP ARTERIES. Taking the last of these theories first, we think that the explanation applies to Ponfick^s cases alone, and not to any of the others to which we have alluded in the appended table, for in none of them was any calcareous embolus found, nor, with one exception, were the vegeta- tions on the valves noted to be calcified. On the other hand, we find that of twenty-five recorded cases in which the condition of the heart was mentioned, there was ulcerative endocarditis in progress at the time of death in ten, and recent endocarditis with production of warty vegetations, such as are described by Dr. Good- hart, in twelve others. From the descriptions given, it is probable that in several of the latter there was ulceration of the valves, but this is not definitely stated. In the three remaining cases there was certainly some recent endocarditis, but whether warty or ulcerating is not clear from the descriptions. Further, it is noteworthy that although Ponfick attri- butes the aneurisms in his cases to the calcareous nature of the emboli, yet in all of them he describes the heart as being the seat of recurrent warty endocarditis," and in two of his six cases he describes ulceration as being present. In our own case, although the emboli were calcareous, we do not attribute the formation of the aneurisms to this fact, but rather to the presence of a distinct ulcera- tive endocarditis," and a corresponding septic condition of the emboli. In support of this view we submit the following argu- ments : 1st. The aneurisms of the sinuses of Valsalva were not due to ulceration of the arterial walls, but to their softening by inflammation. This could not result from the mecha- nical irritation of a calcareous embolus, and consequently must be considered to be due to an extension to the aorta of the diseased condition of the valves. This proves that the infection of the vessel may result in softening and dilatation without pre-existing ulceration.

43G CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE LIPS AND MOUTH. case which has recently been under my care which places the value of opium in a very strong light. The patient (whose hands were represented in a portrait shown to the Society) was a lady of sixty-one^ who had enjoyed excellent health until her hands began to inflame in the manner depicted. It was a sort of exfoliative der- matitis which developed with exact symmetry on hands and feet J and gradually spread. All the nails were inflamed, and when at length it attacked the scalp all the hair fell out. The lady had had much and very skilful treatment before she came to me, but the disease had steadily advanced. I had her under care for four months before I thought of trying opium, and during this period various local appli- ances were used, and arsenic and phosphorus and other internal remedies had a very fair trial. So far from improving, the state of things got worse and worse, and the general health began to fail very definitely. The patient had lost much flesh, she was bald, and her hands were quite disabled by swelling when I first prescribed opium. From this time improvement set in, and after about four months^ use of the drug we could boast that her hands were quite well, that her nails and hair had grown again, and that she was in excellent health. The drug has now been laid aside for three months, and there has been no relapse.^ The case differs chiefly from the others mentioned in this paper in that there never was any sore mouth. 1 Since this pap^r was read I have seen this patient again with some symptoms of relapse, but they were quite slight.

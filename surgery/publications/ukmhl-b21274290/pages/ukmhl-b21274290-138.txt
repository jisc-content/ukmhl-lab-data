It must also be remembered that the temperatures on the evening of operation are taken in the vagina, and that at this time the vaginal temperature is nearly always, in these cases, a degree or more above the axillary temperature. This must be borne in mind, in com- paring the highest temperatures reached on the operation evening with those on succeeding evenings. Allowing for this, I find that the highest point is reached on the evening of the day after operation in 129 cases, on the operation evening in 93 cases ; on the evening of the second day in 35 cases ; on the evening of the third day in 9 cases ; on the evenings of the fourth and fifth days in 4 cases each, and in single cases it is not reached till the sixth, seventh, eighth, thirteenth, and fifteenth evenings. Thus, excluding two or three exceptional cases, all those that recover have established convalescence within the week, and consider- ably over two thirds within forty-eight hours of the operation. While pointing to these remarkable facts, I must add the caution, that it is unwise to let the patient or the nurse think that convalescence is established; liberties taken under such circumstances are the chief cause of the few exceptional delays named above. Wunderlich, in his standard work on ^ Medical Thermo- metry,^ has given the following as the limits of the states of health, fever, hyperpyrexia, &c. B. Normal or almost normal temperatures. a. Subnormal, 96*8° to 97-7°. h. Keally normal, 97-88° to 99-12°. c. Sub-febrile, 99-5° to ]00'4°. One hundred and thirty-six of the two hundred and seventy-nine recoveries fall within these limits, and recover without fever. C. Febrile temperatures. a. Slight febrile action, 100-4° to 101-12°. I, Moderate degree of fever, 101-12° to 103-1°. c. Considerable fever, 103*1° to 104°. d. High fever, up to 105°. Forty-five cases then have slight febrile reaction; eighty-

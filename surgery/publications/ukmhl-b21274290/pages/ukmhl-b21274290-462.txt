358 THE RELATION OF A CERTAIN FORM OP obliging of patients. Thus from tlie 24t]i of October last to tlie beginning of January my urine was collected, and tlie urea and uric acid, and sometimes other constituents, esti- mated almost without a break. I also made a daily note as to weather, exercise, food, drugs (if any), and health, espe- cially the presence or absence of headache, or threatenings of it. I also weighed myself from time to time. I always took special care to write down my notes about health and headache before beginning the analysis of the urine for the twenty-four hours in question, so that the result of this could not influence my statements. On the 2nd of November, I began, for the purpose of this experiment, to take butcher's meat and cheese, each once in the day, having previously (except when away from home) abstained from them for several years; and I continued to take them in very slowly increasing amounts (but only once a day) till the 2nd of January. At first they seemed to have little effect; but gradually the threaten- ings of headache got more frequent and severe till in the twenty-four hours ending 26th of December, I had a headache lasting more than eight hours, and on the 2nd of January (1887) I had a more severe headache than I had experienced since May, 1885 ; and that one was I believe due to my breaking through my diet rules with several too good dinners. On the 2nd of January I left off the meat and cheese again, and I have since (now more than four weeks) been practically free from headache, having on one occasion only a slight threatening. I think, therefore, that there can be no reasonable doubt of the intimate relation of this form of headache to diet, at least in this particular case, and my observations lead me to believe that cases of it that are apparently similarly affected by diet are not by any means rare. As to the relation of this headache to the excretion of uric acid, my results at first were very equivocal, and though it seemed to me that there was some relation between the two, I thought that the uric acid was, if anything, slightly diminished on the days on which

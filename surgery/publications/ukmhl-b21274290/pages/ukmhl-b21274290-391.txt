SACCULATED AORTIC ANEURISM. 287 exposing our patient to the danger whicli proved fatal to him. We were under the impression that the aneurism was even larger than it proved, and, guided by previous operators, we continued to pass in the wire until distinct resistance was met with, and did not regard, as we should have done, the serious risk this entailed. The hgemorrhage during the operation was annoying to the operator but probably beneficial to the patient. The following is a list of all the cases which we have been able to find in which Moore^s treatment has been carried out. 1. Moore. 1864. Aortic aneurism; iron wire, 26 yards; death. ('Med.- Chir. Trans.,' xlvii.) 2. Levis. 1873. Subclavian; horsehair; death. 3. Bryant. 1873. Popliteal; horsehair, 20 feet; "almost complete con- solidation ;" death in five days from ulcerative endocarditis. 4. Rubio. 1874. Innominate; iron wire, 2â€”3 metres ; death. 5. Paul. 1874. Innominate; horsehair, 15 feet; death. (' Med.-Chir. Proc.,' New Ser., 12.) 6. Levis. 1876. Innominate and subclavian; horsehair, several yards; death. 7. Levis. External iliac; horsehair, several yards; inflammation, suppu- ration of sac; death from haemorrhage. 8. Baccelli. 1884. Aortic ; watch spring ; death. 9. Baccelli. 1884. Aortic; watch spring; death. 10. Van der Meulen. 1879. Brachial; catgut; recovery. 11. Loreta. 1885. Abdominal. Silvered copper wire; recovery. 12. Ransohoff. 1886. Aortic ; silver wire; death. 13. Maury. Subclavian ; horsehair; death. 14. Cayley and Hulke. Aortic; steel wire; improvement; death. 15. Pringle and Morris. Aortic ; steel wire; death. 16. White and Gould. Aortic; steel wire; death. Among these sixteen cases there are but two of com- plete recovery : those of Loreta and Van der Meulen ; but in two more, those of Bryant and Hulke, the result was at any rate a partial success. Ashhurst mentions that Dom- ville, Montenoveri, and Stimson have also had unsuccess- ful cases, but we have not been able to find details of these.

OVARIOTOMY. 55 Pej^tonitis. Case 291 was one of acute torsion of the pedicle; with general effusion of blood into the tumour and broad liga- ment. At the time I was allowed to operate;, acute peritonitis had set in, and she was very feeble from the haemorrhage; the operation was a forlorn hope, and she never rallied. Embolism. Case 370 was a case of sudden death, from embolism. The patient was so well, and had been so well all througb that I had allowed her husband to leave town ; she woke in the night, chatted and laughed with the nurse, and fell back dead. No post-mortem was allowed, but it was a clear case of sudden movement of clot. I am afraid that these brief notes of failure may seem tedious, but when read with the other details of the cases given in the tables, they are full of useful suggestions as to the possibility and impossibility of avoiding like misfortunes in the future. I can truly say, that I never go over my case-books without getting useful hints for practice, and food for thought. Frequently a direct reference to my tables, when in difficulty and doubt, helps the treatment or prognosis of a similar case. All the tables have been compiled as my operations were done, and all have been very frequently revised, but it is possible that there may be some errors. If any of those who have sent me cases can find any errors I shall be grateful if they will point them out.

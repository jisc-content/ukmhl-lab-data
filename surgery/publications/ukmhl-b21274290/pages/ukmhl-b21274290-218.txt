MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OP ARTERIES. 120 12th.—Since the application of pressure^ the elbow- tumour has diminished to its size on admission, and is manifestly firmer. Altogether the patient is much re- lieved. 14th.—No pulsation can be detected in the aneurism at the bend of the elbow. On examining the front of the right knee pulsation is detected in the arteries, which are much enlarged, and with the stethoscope a bruit can be heard. There is also slight pulsation in both tibial arteries of the same side. Circumference of the popliteal tumour is llf inches, and of the elbow, 9^ inches. 17th.—The elbow tumour yesterday suddenly enlarged to lOJ inches, and this morning measures llf inches. 19th.—The patient had last night a sudden remission of pain in the elbow, and to-day there is a brownish dis- colouration of the skin over the tumour, due probably to blood leaking through the walls of the aneurism. Liga- ture of the brachial artery was determined upon, and was performed a short distance above the aneurism, by tying the vessel with carbolised catgut ligatures in two places and dividing the artery between them. All pulsa- tion ceased, and the edges of the wound were brought together by carbolised catgut sutures, the operation being performed antiseptically throughout. 21 st.—The patient has been much more comfortable generally and locally since the operation ; sleeping and eating well. The arm was dressed, all the sutures were removed as the wound had united throughout its entire length. The measurement of the popliteal aneurism remains as before. 27th.—The popliteal tumour having increased during the night with the same discoloration over it as was noticed in the elbow, the superficial femoral artery was tied at the apex of Scarpa^s triangle in the same manner as the brachial a few days before. December 1st.—She is able for the first time since admission to bend her right elbow. To-day the crural wound was dressed and had united except at the upper

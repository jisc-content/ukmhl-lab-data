263 ANEURISM OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. bruit was heard over the area of pulsation without exert- ing pressure with the stethoscope. There was also a tender region in the back to the left of the three upper lumbar vertebrge^ overwhich the heart-sounds were plainly audible. Pulsation in the femoral arteries was forcible^ equals and synchronous on the two sides^ and tracings, subsequently taken, presented characteristically aneurismal oblique line of ascent and loss of summit wave. The diagnosis of aneurism arising from the abdominal aorta, probably sacculated with narrow aperture and eroding the vertebra, was made; absolute rest was enjoined; the diet was regulated on TufnelFs principles, applied as rigorously as the fractiousness of the patient would permit; iodide and bromide of potassium were administered four times daily, the former in gradually augmented doses of fifteen to sixty grains, and hypodermic injections of morphia were given at night or according as pain or restlessness indicated. Progress.â€”On October 1st pulsation was plainly felt and systolic murmur heard in the left ilio-lumbar region. On October 4th the advisability of surgical treatment was discussed in consultation with Mr. Morris, who con- sidered that proximal compression of the aorta was feasible only if a well-made cone-shaped pad were fitted to the abdominal tourniquet, and as the pulsation extended so low it was very doubtful if distal compression would do more than control one of the primary branches immediately beyond the bifurcation of the aorta. Laparotomy and the introduction of steel wire was, on the whole, thought to be the operation best suited to the

That in many cases after ligature of the femoral artery in Scarpa^s triangle the trunk of the vessel below remains to a greater or less extent per- vious is a fact well known to all of us; but I think, also, most of us would have said that in many cases, perhaps in the majority, the canal becomes obliterated. But this table of twenty-six cases furnishes no single instance in which after the operation the artery was rendered imper- vious throughout. Of seventeen specimens which are perfect, in four instances it is to a greater or less extent pervious, and in thirteen instances it is patent throughout. Very probably, in almost all cases, it is diminished in size, but this point cannot be determined clearly in the pre- served specimens, and the extent to which it remains patent is no doubt greatly influenced by the size, number, and arrangement of its branches. The specimens, however, hardly afford demonstration of this, but it is clear that while in some cases branches arise from the patent portions, in others they arise from a part that has become imper- vious.^ 1 The obliteration of the trunk of an artery below a ligature has been, per- haps, generally regarded as a very gradual process. For instance. Sir Astley Cooper wroteâ€” When a ligature has been applied it is some time before the artery below becomes obliterated. Mr. Forster, surgeon of Guy's Hospital, has a drawing in his possession of a case of popliteal aneurism for which the femoral artery

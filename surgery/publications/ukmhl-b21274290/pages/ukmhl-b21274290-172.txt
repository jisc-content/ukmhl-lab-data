EARLY DISSEMINATED MYELITIS. 80 immediate indication for therapeutic measures except the application of ice-bags to the spine^ in addition to the one on the head which Mr. Arkle had already ordered. During the evening the temperature rose to 104*2°, and thirty grains of antipyrin were given. In one hour's time there was subsidence to 101'2°;, but there was no improvement in the general state. The patient retched at times, but there was no actual vomiting. At midnight he was not quite so drowsy and answered questions slowly but quite intelligently. His temperature was then 99°. On the morning of the 15th the patient continued less drowsy. His mental state was indeed quite clear. He had had no delirium throughout. He recognised his father, and evidently understood questions, and answered them intelligibly. Otherwise he was much worse. He could only speak in a whisper, and his cough was quite ineffectual, and half suppressed. When questioned as to headache he said he had aching at the backs of his eyes, but his chief trouble now, as from the beginning, was of fixed pain down the breast bone and at the epigastrium, and he said he had a weight on his chest. The paralysis had evidently increased; for in addition to the paralysis of the lower limbs, the absence of reflexes and the reten- tion of the urine, the weakness in the grasp of the hands was more marked, and there was now paralysis of the intercostals so that the upper part of the chest was quite immovable, and the respiration was entirely diaphrag- matic. The tongue when protruded deviated slightly to the left, and there was a suspicion of slight flattening of the right naso-labial fold, but not enough to justify any importance being attached to it. The pulse was 76, soft and regular. Respirations 28. The temperature ranged during the day between 100*2° and 100*8°. The urine was withdrawn, and found free from albumen. The rectum was emptied by enema.

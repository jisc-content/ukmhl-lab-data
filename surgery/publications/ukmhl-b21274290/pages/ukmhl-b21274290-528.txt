420 MULTIPLE GANGRENE OF THE SKIN IN INFANTS. The conclusions I would draw from the consideration of these cases are :â€” 1. That infants and children under three years old are liable to multiple gangrenous ulcers. 2. That while the gangrenous lesions most frequently follow those of varicella and vaccinia they may also ensue from other pustular and non-specific lesions under certain conditions. 3. That when once the gangrenous process has started the fresh lesions do not necessarily arise from a pre-exist- ing pustule but may come independently. 4. While the original eruption varies much, the gan- grenous lesions are very similar in their course and development, viz. of vesicle, pustule, scab and slough surrounded by a red areola closely resembling, before the slough has formed, a vaccine lesion. 5. That the general conditions which coexist are not only specific fevers, such as varicella, vaccinia, and, for the local forms, measles and scarlatina, but tuberculosis and, perhaps, rickets, which are probably related etio- logically to the gangrenous lesions. 6. The one feature that these diseases have in common is the febrile state, but while it is very probable that antecedent fever may be a predisposing cause we are not yet in a position to say that it is essential or that other factors are not required for the production of the gan- grene. Finally, I have only to express my regret that the record of some of the cases is less complete than could be desired, but they were nearly all out-patients, and only seen once or twice, and in the high pressure at which that sort of work has to be done, details which would find a place in a more leisurely record are apt to be omitted.

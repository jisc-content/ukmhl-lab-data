230 TREATMENT OP EMPYEMA BY PERFLATION. view to air-tight closure of the wounded side. It must be confessed that the final operation for enlarging the posterior opening was undertaken unnecessarily under the impression that the expansion of the lung and the oblite- ration of the cavity were not keeping pace with the healing of the external wounds. The auscultatory evi- dence of the extensive re-establishment of breathing during the intervals of closure of the wounds should have been more implicitly trusted. Had this evidence been acted upon the empyema might perhaps have been per- manently closed within fourteen days after the para- centesis. With an actual duration of four weeks the case may nevertheless be looked upon as successful in point of time. Bemarhs on the Method of Pefflation and on its value in the Treatment of Empyema. (Before proceeding with these remarks it is my pleasant duty to express my indebtedness to Mr. Benham, not only for having agreed to the application of a novel method, but for his valuable assistance in the endeavour to render it a success^ and for practical suggestions in the manipu- lation of the apparatus. To his able surgical co-operation is due in a large measure the successful result obtained in the case.) Hippocrates, although free from the indiscriminating dread of air which arose after his time (his only fear was lest the lung should become parched, a danger which he sought to obviate by injecting oil and wine), does not appear to have utilized air surgically in the treatment of empyema. Modern English works contain no mention of the injection of air as a means of treatment in this affection. But in a pamphlet by Audouard ('De TEmpyeme,' Paris^ 1828), the following suggestive re- mark appears as a mere parenthesis : Et pourquoi ne se servirait on pas, de l^air comme moyen medicamenteux ?"

When first seen^ the head was covered with scabs from a quarter to one inch across^ but with little or no inflammation rounds and numerous scars of previous eruption were present. There was one inflamed pustule on the left fore- finger_, and a deep ulcer three quarters of an inch by half an inch over the left ischial tuberosity.

There were also some on the back of the head, and a few down the back. The vesicles became pustules with a red areola, were from a millet seed to a pea in size, and accompanied by intense itching. There are thus a dozen cases of varying degrees of severity, some so mild and chronic, that were it not for intermediate links we should hesitate to class them with those gangrenous cases at the other end of the chain, which are fatal in a few days. From a consideration of these and twenty-one other cases published by Mr. Hutchinson and other authors, we may draw up the following general account of the disease. The place of onset, and mode of development varies according to whether it appears early or late in the course of the varicella, or is independent of that disease. If it begins while the varicella lesions are still present, it commences on the head or upper part of the body, and instead of the scab being thrown off from the pock, ulce-

RUPTURE OF THE BLADDER. 205 Note.â€”The Chairman of the evening, Dr. John W. Ogle, having written to ask me the question, I desire to state that there seem to me to be two possible causes of the giving way of the funnel-like cicatrix : one is that, owing to its extreme thinness, it yielded under distension of the bladder; the other, that softening and ulceration occurred from the retention and decomposition of urine in the funnel-like recess, just as a sacculus occasionally yields from the same cause. The account of the fatal illness points to the latter cause as the more probable.

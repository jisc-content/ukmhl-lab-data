ON THE ACTIVE PEINCIPLE OP CASTOE OIL. ■BY THOMAS DIXSON, LECTUEER ON MATERIA MEDICA IN THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY. (COMMTTNICATED BY De. LAUDER BRUNTON, r.R.S.) Received June 7th—Read November 23rd, 1886. It has long been known that the seeds of castor oil are exceedingly active, but the active principle has never been isolated. The object of the following paper is to try and throw some light upon the connection between the activity of the seeds and that of the oil. Previous observers having either obtained no definite result or contradictory results, the further investigation of the sub- ject was suggested to me by Professor Schmiedeberg, of Strasburg. The last investigation previous to mine was that of Bubnow, who found that by extracting the seeds with acid, filtering the solution, and then precipitating with an alkali, a precipitate was obtained which was active when dried. This young investigator having been unfor- tunately removed by death, without publishing his method, I had to recommence afresh. After removing the oil from

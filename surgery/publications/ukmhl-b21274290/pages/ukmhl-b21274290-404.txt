300 ANEURISM AT THE ROOT OF THE NECK. solution of potassic hydrate to remove grease, washed in distilled water, immersed in a solution of carbolic acid, and as it was being drawn off the cylinder on which it was coiled it was passed through a sponge wet with the same solution. With the idea of lessening as much as possible hand contact with the wire, and of facilitating its passage through the tube into the sac, Messrs. Maw and Thompson have constructed the little apparatus exhibited. Its principal parts are a small cistern in which the wire coiled on a revolving cylinder is immersed in an antiseptic solution. Connected with this is a tubular needle for use as a trocar, and intermediately placed are two small rollers which grip the wire between them, and by turning the milled head of the upper roller the wire is drawn off the cylinder and passed through the needle-tube.^ ^ In carrying out these ideas much ingenuity has been shown by Mr. Jones, the surgical mechanician to the hospital, a workman in the employ of the above firm.

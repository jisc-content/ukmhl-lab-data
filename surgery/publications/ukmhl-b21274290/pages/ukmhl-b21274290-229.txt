In all cases, however, except that recorded by Ponfick, the process of formation of the aneurism has not been demon- strated. We believe that in the case recorded by us the mode of formation of the aneurisms is clearly demonstrated. An examination of the specimen both by the naked eye and by the microscope reveals that where the embolus has lodged the artery wall has been inflamed. The inflam-

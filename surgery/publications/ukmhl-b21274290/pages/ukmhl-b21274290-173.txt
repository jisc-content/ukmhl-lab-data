EAELY DISSEMINATED MYELITIS. 81 The patient gradually became cyanosed with rapid respiration, clammy sweat, and tracheal rales, and died at 9 p.m. I regret that we had no opportunity of making an electrical examination. The date of appearance of symptoms may be summarised as follows : June 4th (first day of illness).—First felt ill. Between 4th and 10th complained of cough, pain, and tightness referred to breast bone. 10th (sixth day of illness).—Rash. 13th (ninth day of illness).—Retention of urine. 14th (tenth day of illness).—Paralysis of lower limbs and loss of superficial and deep reflexes. Paresis of upper limbs. 15th (eleventh day of illness).—Paralysis affecting inter costals. Death. The post-mortem examination was made twenty hours after death. Rigor mortis was well marked. There was much staining of the skin, the vestige of the measles rash. The heart was free from valvular disease, the right cavities were greatly distended with coagulum. There was con- solidation of the lower lobe of the left lung, and intense congestion with ecchymosis of the trachea and bronchi. The liver showed some pallid areas, and there was a small calcareous nodule in the right lobe of uncertain origin. No syphilitic lesions were to be found in any part of the body. There was no scar on the penis, and no enlargement of glands in the groins, and the tibise were natural. The spleen was enlarged and rather soft. The kidneys appeared healthy. The intestines were natural. The calvaria was natural; there was much venous distension of the meninges, but no lymph. The grey matter of the convolutions was darker than natural. The brain-substance generally was unduly soft. The ependyma of the lateral ventricles was very easily de- tached. In the spinal canal there was much venous engorgement. On slitting up the membranes no lymph was found. The VOL. LXX. 6

On ophthalmoscopic exami- nation the fundus of each eye appears quite normal. Examination of the throat shows nothing abnormal, and no nodes are found on the bones. There is no facial or ocular paralysis, and the facial muscles are not wasted although those of the neck are. The urine is opaque and yellow in colour, acid, having a specific gravity of 1028, deposits an abundant sediment of lithates, and is free from albumen and sugar. Electrical examination of the muscles of leg and arm by Dr. Pasteur, the Medical Registrar, to whom and to Dr. Pringle I am indebted for all the electrical investigations, gave the following results : Left forearm.—No contraction front and back to faradic current. Galvanism : Supinator longus A.C.C. 7) = C.C.C. Ext. carpi ulnaris A.C.C. {fj. 5*5) = C.C.C. Ext. carpi radialis A.C.C. 6) > C.C.C. The response was immediate and the contraction volu- minous and slow. Left leg.—No contraction to faradic current of the fol- lowing muscles : Tibialis anticus, extensor communis, peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, extensor brevis, gastro- cnemius. Galvanism : Tibialis anticus A.C.C. 5) > C.C.C. Extensor communis A.C.C. 5) > C.C.C. Peroneus longus A.C.C. (ju 8) = C.C.C. (mere flicks). Peroneus brevis A.C.C. 8) = C.C.C. (decided). Extensor brevis No contraction. Gastrocnemius No contraction. No contraction of intercostals is obtained either with faradism or galvanism. No change in her condition was recorded until the evening of January 31st, when she had an attack of

RUPTURE OF THE BLADDER. 204 The opening into it from the bladder was finely plicated and had somewhat the appearance of cicatricial tissue^ but no microscopical examination was made to determine whether it was cicatricial tissue or attenuated mucous membrane, as to have done so would have injured the specimen. There were no peritoneal adhesions in the pelvis, other than the one above described, but some old pigmented patches were noticed in the deepest part of the recto- vesical pouch. The explanation of the foregoing changes, taken with the clinical history of the case, seems to us as follows : 1. This pouch marks the site of an injury to the bladder and surrounding structures received by the patient in June, 1879. 2. That injury was in all probability a rupture of the bladder attended with extravasation of urine into the peritoneal cavity, and into the cellular tissue and struc- tures of the bladder wall. 3. At the site of the injury, the bladder and rectum became united by inflammatory lymph. 4. The contractions of the bladder and bowel, hollowed out this adhesion by their traction upon it; thus leading to the formation of the infundibuliform recess above de- scribed, and thereby predisposing to the fatal rupture. 5. The perfectly normal appearance of the rest of the bladder, and the characters of the recess itself, negative the supposition that this was an ordinary congenital diverticulum or acquired sacculus. 6. The specimen, in our opinion, exhibits all the features which might be expected at a remote period after a rupture of the bladder. (Signed) Thomas Bryant. W. S. Savory. J.

OVARIOTOMY. 54 slight threatening of tetanus. I went into the country several weeks later^ and performed ovariotomy^ and tetanus carried her off on the sixth day after opera- tion. This is the only case of the disease I have ever had in my practice, and it is worthy of note that it occurred in cold, windy weather in the spring, when tetanus was apparently rife, for there were notices of several cases in the journals at the time. The paroxysms in my patient were first started by a violent gust of wind, and recurred every time the house was shaken by the wind. Abscess in pedicle stump. Case 254 was that of a young woman with a solid sarcoma of the lei't ovary, the disease penetrated so deeply into the broad ligament, that I had to tie my ligatures in sarcomatous tissue. She did well at first, then got very high temperature, for which we could find no cause, and literally died of fever without any other bad symptoms. The post-mortem revealed a small slough and confined abscess in the pedicle. She was probably saved the worse fate of a lingering death from recurrent sarcoma. Ohstruction of intestines. Cases 276 and 371 died of obstruction, the former acute from infective peritonitis, and the latter worn out by chronic obstruction, which never seemed bad enough to justify reopening the abdomen, till she was too exhausted to give one any chance of doing so with success. It is always a subject of wonder to me that more cases do not die of obstruction while carrying these great adherent tumours, and after their removal.

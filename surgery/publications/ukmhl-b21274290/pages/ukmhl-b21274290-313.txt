RELIEVING THE DISTENDED URINARY BLADDER. 209 distended to any extent short of that which would cause a temporary paralysis is followed immediately by a jet of urine^ through the instrument^ the force of which is determined by the degree of elastic tension in the organ. After an interval, momentary in itself,, the stream becomes much stronger from violent spasmodic contraction of the muscular elements of the vesical walls, aided by the action of the abdominal muscles, which, under these circum- stances, are, as a rule, beyond the control of the patient. It follows, therefore, I assume, that the period of greatest tension is not at the moment of the entry of the instrument, but shortly afterwards ; unless the bladder is enahled to empty itself very rapidly. It is at this moment that the liability to rupture or oozing is the greatest, and then must be the time at which a free flow is most called for, such a flow as would be provided by the use of the ordinary trocar and canula usually hitherto employed for tapping the bladder through the rectum or above the pubes as the case may be. I may at once state that I believe the aspirator may be used without risk of rupture or exudation for cases in which the bladder coats are healthy, as they may of course be in a case of recent acute retention, but in cases of old- standing obstruction, whether from stricture or prostatic enlargement, where the bladder walls are hypertrophied, varying in thickness, and often rotten or easily lacerable, the proceeding may be productive of serious harm, and is altogether inferior to the older method of tapping with the large trocar and canula. An objection of a minor kind to the use of the aspirator seems to me to present itself in those cases in which the bladder contains putrid urine, for it must surely be a pro- ceeding of doubtful advisability to withdraw, through the perivesical cellular tissue, a needle which has been directly before steeped in a decomposing and virulent fluid. Whatever value may be attached to the foregoing remarks, the following case will sufliciently demonstrate the serious complications which may follow the simple VOL. LXX. 14

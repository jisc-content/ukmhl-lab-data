OVARIOTOMY. 50 I would sum up this matter by saying, never tap, and, given an ovarian tumour distinctly to be diagnosed, perform ovariotomy without delay. After histories also give very important information, as to the effect of the removal of both ovaries on menstruation; but this is a subject too large to treat here, and will require a special paper to deal adequately with it. I have given a very full table of the incomplete and exploratory operations, and explanatory remarks at the end of the table, so that it will not be necessary for me to refer to them separately ; but I would call attention to the fact that all but one of the incomplete ovariotomies were rendered so by the infiltrations of malignant disease ; that all the immediate deaths were in these malignant cases ; that the subsequent deaths were due to the pro- gressive advance of such disease; and that the non- malignant cases all did well. I will now briefly allude to the causes of death in the fatal cases, not taking them quite in numerical order, but grouping them together under the following heads. Septicsemia, Case 191.â€”The septic mischief was, I believe, derived from a dilated and cystic Fallopian tube, the symptoms came on early, as they generally do in well-marked cases of septicaemia (^. e. they are not well-doing cases from the first). She seemed, however, to have fought through it, and to be on the way to recovery, when suddenly her right parotid gland swelled and became very painful, her temperature rose again, and in twelve hours she was dead. This is one of the cases in which it is possible that drainage might have been useful, but I think it is very doubtful; my notion being that the ligatures were infected by passing through the cystic tube, and that the pedicle sloughed from the putridity spreading into the distal part.

MULTIPLE GANGRENE OF THE SKIN 414 five others there was not the slightest evidence of varicella^ and in one the child had been under close observation for lichen planus infantum, and the ulcerative lesions appeared to develop on miliaria rubra pustules. These facts suggest that under certain circumstances any erup- tion of isolated pustules may be the starting-point of the ulcers. Among predisposing causes tuberculosis has been present in so many that, as Dr. Barlow first pointed out, it must be more than a mere coincidence. In one of my fatal cases congenital syphilis was present, in another rickets, while a few were apparently quite healthy. Gan- grenous ulcers of probably similar character occur some- times as a complication of variola in adults, as well as in children. The diagnosis is not difiicult, with or without a history of varicella ; the occurrence of numerous gangrenous ulcers in a young child, or even of deep ulceration beginning as a pustule, enlarging, drying into a scab in the centre, and then ulcerating, form a group of symptoms quite un- mistakable. The prognosis is serious in proportion to the tender age of the infant, the number, depth and extent of the lesions, the amount of constitutional disturbance, the presence of tuberculosis, pyaemic, or inflammatory lung symptoms. The treatment must be general and local; quinine in one- or two-grain doses in milk every four hours is often serviceable. In some of my cases sulpho-carbolate of soda in five-grain doses every three hours has been apparently beneficial. All complications must be treated as they arise. Wet boracic lint under oiled-silk until the sloughs have separated, and subsequently iodoform or iodol vaseline will keep the ulcers antiseptic. Freshly-made iodide of starch paste, painted on, is another convenient application, and Pasteur, of London, found a warm solution of chlori- nated lime on lint give most relief. These measures and the administration of concentrated, or, in young infants,

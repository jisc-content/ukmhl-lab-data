147 THE CURE OF POPLITEAL ANEURISM. the femoral need hardly be taken into account. And for the restj with regard to the two operations, the advantage appears to me to be with ligature of the popliteal_, mainly on the score of the greater certainty of its success in the cure of the aneurism. In view then of the number of cases known to us in which ligature of the femoral artery has failed I would ask whether we may not reconsider the question of ligature of the popliteal artery for the cure of popliteal aneurism ?

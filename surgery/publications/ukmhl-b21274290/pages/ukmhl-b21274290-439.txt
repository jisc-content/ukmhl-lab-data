A CASE OF INTUSSUSCEPTION OF THE UPPER END OF THE RECTUM DUE TO OBSTRUCTION BY A NEW GROWTH. EXCISION OP THE INTUSSUSCEPTION ; SUTURE OF THE REMAINING BOWEL; COMPLETE RECOVERY. BY AETHUR E. BAEKER, F.E.C.S., SURGEON TO UNIVERSITY COLLEaE HOSPITAL; TEACHER OF PRACTICAL SURGERY AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE.

And though the condition met with in the following case is one of great rarity, and not likely often in a lifetime to come under the notice of any one man, the case would be nevertheless of much interest if it only offered one more illustration of what may be undertaken and achieved with the help of strict antiseptic precautions. I believe that without the latter this opera- tion would not have been justifiable or successful ; with them it was one which, albeit difficult, offered no complications, and was followed by a rapid and perfect recovery.

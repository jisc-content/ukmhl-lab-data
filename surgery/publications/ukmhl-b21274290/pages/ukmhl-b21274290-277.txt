LESION OF SYPHILIS IN WOMEN. 173 became raised into a tubercle-like prominent sore the size of a walnut shelly while in contrast may be noticed Case 75^ where the sores were merely three slightly raised pale spots on the mucous membrane, and Case 80, where the mucous membrane was merely a little thickened and slightly altered in colour. Certainly to be noted as a peculiarity is the large proportion of cases (here about one third) where the degree of induration is so slight that it can hardly be appreciated; an important point con- nected with its diagnostic value. Next as to position and the circumscription of the induration ; whilst in men it is described as being dis- tinctly circumscribed and confined to the base of the sore itself, and clearly marked off from the surrounding tissues, this is very far from being the case always in women. As to its diffusion the thickening is very commonly widely spread far beyond the base of the sore ; thus about a dozen cases will be found in the table, where the indu- ration spread widely through the tissues, and it is not at all uncommon, as in several of these, to see the sore con- fined to a portion, say one extremity, of a labium, whilst the whole labium is infiltrated, thickened, and resistant. It is remarkable in connection with this matter that in Case 143, where the primary sore consisted of a circular reddened moist surface on the mucous membrane, neither raised nor palpably thickened, the induration which developed in connection with it did not form in its base, which was never thickened, but spread away from it to the adjacent part of the labium (it being in the posterior commissure), which became thickened and infil- trated. In extent, too, the induration not unfrequently spreads in a flattened form widely through the circumjacent skin, rendering it hard, thickened, and also discoloured, as in one case (109) where it extended up from the labium into the groin, where there were indurated glands, and in another (28), where a large patch of skin on the buttock became superficially thickened in immediate con-

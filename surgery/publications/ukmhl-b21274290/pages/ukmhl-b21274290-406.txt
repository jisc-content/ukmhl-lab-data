302 writers' cramp and impaired writing power. 4. Neuritic or neuralgic (20 cases). 5. Writers' cramp proper (31 cases). 6. Anomalous (4 cases). With the present 93 cases certain changes in this classification are necessary. Class 1 as then constituted is omitted, because with the exception of 2 cases of paresis from pressure on nerves the present series contains no case of definite nerve para- lysis. In Class 2 (spasmodic) 4 out of the 5 cases were conse- quent on cerebral lesion. These 4 will therefore be placed in the new paralytic (cerebral) group. Cases 16 and 17 clearly were cerebral, and so also was probably Case 75 (congenital left-handedness). Nos. 73 and 74 (locomotor ataxy and general paralysis) will be placed in the degenerative group, and I shall omit No. 72. Further, for the purposes of comparison I shall include groups 4 and 5 in the same class, which I shall speak of as the neuro-muscular groups. Thus, by the omission of Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, and 72, there remain 67 of my previous series available for comparison with the present 93, and these 67 may be thus arranged : 1. Paralytic (cerebral), 7 cases. 2. Degenerative, 9 cases. 3. Neuro-muscular, 51 cases. Adopting the classification for my present 93 cases I have: 1. Paralytic, 13 cases (10 cerebral). 2. Degenerative, 14 cases. 3. Neuro-muscular, 66 cases. Paralytic group.â€”20 cases, of which 13 belong to the new series. Of these 13 cases No. 76 was possibly (?) due to lead-poisoning, and Nos. 77 and 86 were cases of paresis due to pressure on nerves ; 8 (78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85) were cases of paresis due probably to long antecedent cerebral paralysis. None of them were coarsely

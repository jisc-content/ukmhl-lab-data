MULTIPLE GANGRENE OF THE SKIN 398 itching, and appear to me to correspond with the cases called by Mr. Hutchinson varicella prurigo.'^ Thirdly, a precisely analogous condition may follow vaccinia. Fourthly, I would suggest that the condition is of microbic origin and may follow any pustular eruption in which the soil is suitable. The predisposing conditions are tuherculosis, as was first pointed out by Dr. Barlow, while con-genital syphilis and richets are probably also etiological factors in a certain number. Class 1.—No Antecedent Varicella. Case 1.—Ellen A. B—, £et. 1, was first brought to University College Hospital as an out-patient on July 7thj 1886.

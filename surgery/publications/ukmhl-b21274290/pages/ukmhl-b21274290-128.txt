She ceased to menstruate on the 9th of May and soon after considered herself pregnant^ and her pregnancy proceeded without incident, except that she thought she was larger than at corresponding periods in former pregnancies, until the beginning of July, when she had an attack of what she was told was ^' inflammation in the right lower abdomen, and since then she had never been free from pain.

On examination per vaginam the lower segment of the uterus appeared expanded and fixed; the external os was patulous, and admitted the finger as far as the inner os, which was tightly closed. The sound, however, passed easily, and apparently in the normal axis to a distance of about three inches. Bimanual examination was difficult both on account of the condition of the vagina, to be described, and the fixation of the pelvic contents, and added but little to the informa- tion gained by abdomiual palpation. There was a large

ALCOHOLIC PARALYSIS. 380 supinator loiigus to Qtrong, faradic currents. The muscles in front of the forearm react to weaker currents. There is no reaction to strong faradic currents in the extensor communis digitorum or in the extensor minimi digiti.

Legs.—Faradism.—Strong secondary currents produce no contraction of the gastrocnemius^ peronei, tibiales, or extensors of foot, either over the muscles or from motor points. Galvanism.—With a current of five milliamperes there is both anodal and kathodal contraction of the extensor longus digitorum of right leg ; the contraction is slow and wave-like (A.C.C. — C.C.C.)^and other factors of modified degenerative reaction are present; the amount of current required for contraction being subnormal, and contraction produced not being that of health. No other group of muscles was examined on account of the impossibility of moving patient^s legs without causing pain, but these re- actions probably give a correct index of the condition of other paralysed muscles. After this date she got rapidly worse, the wrist-drop and foot-drop became more marked, and there was much tenderness in the calves of the legs ; her incoherence con- tinued and she spoke with weak voice and a snuffling tone ; the tongue was dry and protruded with difficulty. The pulse became more rapid and feeble, the extremities cold, and the breathing shallower. She had occasional twitch- ings of the arms the day before her death, which took place on November 29th, at 3.45 a.m. The temperature was only on three occasions over 100°, and was below that figure on the evening before her death ; it was generally about normal. The pulse, 72 at first, increased to 160 during the ten days she was in the hospital, and her respirations rose from 20 to 32. At the post-mortem examination the lungs were found to be congested and extremely oedematous, the liver very

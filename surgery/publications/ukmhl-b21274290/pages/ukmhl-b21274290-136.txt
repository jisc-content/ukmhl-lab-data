.44 OVAEIOTOMY. is, however, shown by the fact that my work at the Samaritan Hospital has yielded one consecutive series of one hundred complete ovariotomies without a death from septicaemia, and with the more healthy surroundings of the new hospital, which we hope soon to build, such pleasant experience will doubtless recur. There are twenty-one deaths in the 300 ovarioto- mies, or a mortality of 7 per cent., not quite what I had hoped to reach, but still a result of which I shall not pretend to be ashamed, especially when I remem- ber that in a similar series of 300 ovariotomies pub- lished in the ' Transactions ' of this Society by Sir Spencer Wells in 1877, the mortality was 25*66 per cent., and that in 1881, when the ^ Transactions ^ contain tables of 512 ovariotomies performed by Sir Spencer Wells, Dr. Bantock and myself, the average mortality of the whole series is still 13'28 per cent., or nearly double that of my present series. The most recent publication of any large number of cases is that of Mr. Lawson Tait.^ He gives 405 ovarioto- mies with thirty-three deaths, a mortality of 8*15 per cent. In my 150 cases published in 1881, and included in the 512 cases just alluded to, the mortality was 10 per cent. In the first 150 of the present series, it is 7*33 per cent., and in the second 150 it is 6*66 per cent. The decrease in the mortality becomes smaller with each 150 cases, and it must be so until the minimum is reached. I only trust that in each future 150 cases a fractional improvement may still be found. In 106 of the 300 cases there were no adhesions, and in eighteen others the adhesions were only slight; but in the large proportion of 176 cases the adhesions were extensive, and in these all the mortality occurs. Forty-two were operated upon in private houses, forty- eight in nursing homes, and the remaining 210 in the Samaritan Hospital. In the former series, all the cases operated upon at their 1 * Medical Press and Circular/ vol. i, 1885, pp. 65, 89.

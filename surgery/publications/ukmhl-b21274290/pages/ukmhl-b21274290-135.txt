OVAEIOTOMY. 43 water, small quantities of bread and milk, or of clear beef- tea, at frequent intervals, till the patient can take more solid food, sucb as boiled sole, chicken, &c. The abdominal wound, when the drainage-tube is not used, is first dressed at the end of the week, and the sutures removed; a small narrow dressing of dry carbolic gauze is then applied, and the abdomen, as immediately- after the operation, is again well supported by adhesive straps. If drainage be necessary the glass tube is cleared under the spray every twelve hours, till it is removed, the india-rubber sheet and sponge dressing introduced by Keith being used under the gauze dressing. In my last paper I gave tables and particulars of a num- ber of other abdominal sections, and I give in the present paper a detailed table of twenty cases of exploratory operations in which the diagnosis was probably ovarian tumour but the number of abdominal operations has so increased that it would only cause confusion if one attempted to deal in the same paper with all the different cases, and hysterectomy, oophorectomy in its various applications, nephrectomy, hepatotomy, splenectomy, &c., will form the subject of separate papers, to be brought before this or some of the sister societies. The tables contain such a mass of facts that it will not be either necessary or possible to refer to all or most of them, but I shall follow, as nearly as I think advisable, the lines of my previous papers, and dwell especially upon the fatal cases, as we learn, or should learn, more from our failures than from our successes; and it is too much the fashion to make it appear that failures are so rare that they are not worth special record. All these operations have been performed with full anti- septic precautions, and I am not prepared to alter my method ; nor have I as yet seen any full and trustworthy evidence that I should benefit my patients by so doing. I cannot claim to have banished septic fatalities in the whole series, and probably no system will ever quite attain such perfection. How much care will do in this direction

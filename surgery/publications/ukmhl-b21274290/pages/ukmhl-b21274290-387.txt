SACCULATED AOETIC ANEURISM. 283 he died. The temperature throughout the last ten days of li£e_, is shown on the accompanying chart. Post-mortem examination (twenty-six hours after death) by Dr. White.—Eigor mortis marked ; much hypostatic congestion of the dependent parts. The considerable swelling of the right side of the chest and neck and right arm wore a purplish aspect^ and large bullae containing blood-stained serum were present around the right nipple. Arborescent lines of brown discolouration were scattered over the chest and extremities. The tumour of the chest felt hard. The skin, subcutaneous fat, and the pectoral muscle were reflected from the aneurism, and in doing this much sanguineous fluid escaped. The tumour protruded through the chest wall, between the second and third rib cartilages close to the sternum, and further out, between the third and fourth ribs. Over its outer part the muscle was blended in the sac wall. Two small portions of the sac, each about the size of a threepenny piece, and close to the punctures, were obviously sloughy, and during the dissection one of these gave way, and some of the wire protruded from the aperture, and a considerable quantity of dark fluid blood ran out.

MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OP ARTERIES. 124 remains of an embolus, consisting of calcareous material of precisely the same nature as that met with on the vege- tations attached to the aortic valves, and hidden to a great extent by blood-clot. The greater part of this calcareous matter was found in the ulnar artery, and here it formed a very distinct and hard lump. The wall of the radial, however, had been completely ulcerated through, and small portions of gritty material here protruded through its walls into the tissues outside the vessel. Below the seat of embolism both the radial and ulnar arteries were very small, and filled with clot as far as the middle third of the forearm. Vessels of the Right Lower Extremity. The right common iliac artery was occluded immediately above its bifurcation by a large embolus, composed chiefly of calcareous matter similar to that found on the aortic valves. Around this was some recent blood-clot. The common iliac above the seat of embolism was perfectly healthy, but where the embolus was lodged the artery was thinned, and distinctly bulged to the outer side. On partly separating the embolus from the vessel, the endo- thelial lining of the latter was found to be irregular and pitted, as though from recent inflammation or ulceration. The internal iliac artery was patent, and its walls natural. The external iliac artery was shrunken, and filled with dark firm clot. The common femoral was in a similar condition. The superficial femoral was filled with clot in its upper two inches, and below this, for about a similar distance, the artery was represented by a fibrous cord. It was at this place that the ligatures had been applied, but no traces of them could be found. The vessel was filled with clot in almost the whole remainder of its course, but the popliteal artery was patent.

122 MULTIPLE EMBOLISM OF AETERIES. adhered loosely to numerous vegetations. On washing off this clot it was found that one of the cusps was almost completely ulcerated away. The two other cusps were covered by numerous vegetations, some of which had undergone calcareous degeneration, and formed large, pen- dulous growths, loosely attached to the valves by slender pedicles, and swaying to and fro when subjected to a gentle stream of water. The aortic valves themselves were softened and lacerable. They had evidently been the seat of recent inflammation. Immediately beyond the valves the aorta was dilated into three pouches or aneurisms corresponding to the sinuses of Valsalva. The largest of these was behind the left posterior segment, and bulged so as to come into close proximity to the left auricular appendage. It was as large as half a walnut and of about the same shape. In none of the pouches was there any clot, ulceration of the endothelium, or evidence of atheroma. Extending up the aorta from these three aneurisms were some granulations, some old, others apparently of recent date. They were very thick near the valves, but rapidly thinned further up the vessel, the highest granulation being placed about one inch and a half from the aortic orifice. At this level there was a small ulcer the size of a split pea, which had completely penetrated the inner and middle coats of the aorta, and had encroached upon the outer coat. Beyond this point the aorta in its whole extent, as well as all its main branches to the neck, arms, and trunk, was perfectly healthy.

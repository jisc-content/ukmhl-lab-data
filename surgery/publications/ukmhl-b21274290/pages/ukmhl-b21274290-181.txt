85 EARLY DISSEMINATED MYELITIS. whole of the cervical enlargement was swollen and softer than natural. At a situation corresponding with about the fifth dorsal vertebra, the whole of the cord was diffluent, and it could not be removed intact. The lumbar enlargement, although it felt tolerably firm externally, was found on section to present some softening in the lateral and posterior columns, and the grey cornua seemed to have been the seat of small haemorrhages, being discoloured, and in places tunnelled out, and the substance very pulpy. The cord was hardened in a 2 per cent, solution of bichromate of ammonium, and I have to thank Dr. Penrose for the microscopic examination of it. His report is as follows : Examination of the cord shows that the changes are entirely vascular in character, that they are universally distributed, but of greater intensity in some regions than in others. There is great engorgement of the vessels, most of the veins being many times their normal calibre and crammed with corpuscles. Many vessels are sur- rounded by a zone of coagulated exudation, and beyond this for a considerable distance the surrounding tissues are infiltrated with leucocytes, giving the appearance in transverse section of a series of concentric rings. Beyond extensive diapedesis there is further evidence of the severity of the congestion, shown by rupture of vessels with subsequent slight interstitial haemorrhage. The portion of the cord which had suffered most was the upper dorsal region, which was so soft that it was impossible to make sections of it. From this region the damage seems to have radiated upwards and downwards through the whole extent from the medulla to the lower part of the lumbar portion. Throughout, the anterior cornua have been most affected, as it is chiefly in them that the haemorrhages are to be found, but vascular changes in the other parts are nearly as great, and, moreover, are not confined to the

170 INDURATION IN THE PRIMARY the genital organs, and in those consecutive lesions in the same situation, to which women seem remarkably prone; rather than in the general manifestations of the fully- developed disease and its later effects, as occurring after ordinary contagion, in which it seems to be identical in the sexes. The establishment of the Government Lock Hospitals for Women under the Contagious Diseases Acts, in operation for about eighteen years, but now recently abolished, furnished excellent opportunities for observing fully those manifestions of syphilis in women alluded to; not only because of the large number of cases, but also because the patients, being compulsorily detained in hospital as long as symptoms lasted, were continuously under obser- vation throughout the course of the disease. Primary sores thus came under notice from the time of their com- mencement, or very soon after, and remained so till their disappearance. In a considerable number of instances the primary sores made their appearance whilst the patients were under detention in hospital for some other form of venereal disease ; ran their whole course, and were fol- lowed by typical courses of general syphilis, thus affording thoroughly authenticated cases, complete throughout, in a manner possible only under the system of the Contagious Diseases Acts. The cases upon which these clinical remarks are based were those admitted into the Eoyal Albert Hospital, Devonport, during a period of six and a half years, and were about 3300 in number. Every case was kept, and all patients thoroughly examined three times a week as a matter of routine. Space will not allow dealing here with more than a very limited part of the subject of the primary lesion of syphilis in women, and it is intended to consider that character of primary syphilitic sores which has always been looked upon as of special diagnostic significance, viz. ^'Induration;'' to inquire into the peculiarities of its characters in women, its development, the question of its

Writers^ cramp and impaired writing power. 315 the muscles moving the joints about which the tremor occurs are especially affected. Obvious spasm was rare. No. 82 had slight athetotic movements, but;, as a rule, it was hardly possible to say, from merely watching the act of writing, why the writing failed. There were some exceptions to this rule, however, and these were instructive. No 76 suffered from extreme flexion of the far-phalanx of the thumb, associated with paralysis of the extensor of that phalanx. No. 117 suffered from a collapsing of the phalangeal joint of the thumb and rotation towards the index, asso- ciated with weakness of the extensor primi internodii and abductor and opponens. No. 127 (like 76) suffered from flexion of the far-phalanx of the thumb associated with weakness of the extensor. Nos. 140 and 144 were very similar cases. In Nos. 129, 13], 139, and 140 there was inability to keep the forefinger on the pen, associated with weakness of the first right dorsal interosseous. No. 156 did not use his thumb while writing, and in this case there was weakness of the flexor brevis pollicis and tremor of the thumb. In No. 163 the phalangeal joint of the thumb collapsed, and it was noticed that faradisation of the flexor longus pollicis caused tremor of the thumb. When writing is made impossible by some decided and recurring spasmodic action, we may expect to find either deficient irritability in the muscles which normally anta- gonise, or excess of irritability in the muscles which nor- mally produce such movement. The examination of the ninety-three cases comprised in the present paper tends to confirm the statements put forward in the previous paper. The most important change has been the suppression of what in the previous paper was called the group of true writers' cramp and its amalgamation with the neuritic

377 ALCOHOLIC PARALYSIS. being granular where the fibres themselves have not be- come altogether indistinguishable. A few axis-cylinders, however, still remain, some of which are much swollen (fig- 2). In longitudinal sections, and in specimens where the nerve has been teased out merely in glycerine, the gran- ular degeneration is well seen. The myelin is segmented and the tubules irregular in their diameter, being empty and fined away to a thread-like prolongation where the myelin has disappeared, and bulged where it has accumulated in degenerate masses (fig. 4). Bight anterior crural nerve.—In this nerve similar con- ditions exist but the degenerate changes are less extreme. Many apparently sound fibres showing clearly the axis- cylinders occur in the transverse section; and in the longitudinal the segmentation and granular condition of the myelin are less marked ; the perineurium is also less thickened. Left median nerve.—In transverse section increase in the connective tissue of the endoneurium is well seen, and there are many atrophied nerve-fibres. Some of the fibres are rather swollen and granula.r showing no axis- cylinder. A considerable proportion, however, appear quite normal. The connective-tissue nuclei and leuco- cytes are abundant. Left musculo-spiral nerve.—The same description applies to this as to the median, except that there appears in transverse section to be a larger relative number of sound fibres. In the longitudinal section, however, most are degenerated at some point, and the segmentation and aggregation in masses of the myelin are conspicuous. Bight extensor carpi radialis longior.—The section of this muscle shows an enormous increase in the nuclei of the connective tissue and of the sarcolemma, with nume- rous leucocytes. The muscle-fibres are diminished in number and size, and the bundles are widely separated ; here and there the fibres are almost completely hidden by the masses of nuclei (fig. 5).

EXTRA-UTERINE GESTATION. 39 on the other. I thought it probably a case where the gesta- tion was extra-uterine and the foetus dead, and this view was strengthened, after her admission to the hospital, by the observation made as to the intestinal character of the uterine discharge, and the passage of the sound to little more than its normal length. The intestinal character of the discharge might, I thought, be accounted for by some entero-uterine fistula resulting from one or other of the abscesses which had successively occurred in connection with the progress of the case. But while we were wait- ing for the eczematous condition of the genital surfaces to improve, and also, if possible, her general health, the foetal tibia was passed in the discharges, and the idea then oc- cured to me that it might possibly be a case of missed abor- tion. Anyway the indication now seemed clear to dilate the cervix and explore the uterine interior. When this was done the second view appeared to be verified, for on dilating the inner os the finger at once came upon the body of the foetus, and it was not until the post-mortem exami- nation that we ascertained that the foetus was essentially extra-uterine in position, and occupying a sac of which the anterior wall was the anterior wall of the uterus, and the remaining walls formed by the inflammatory adhesions already described, and with the posterior wall of the uterus destroyed by ulceration. The age of the foetus, as determined by comparison with others of known age, seemed to be close upon six months, which does not entirely agree with the time the patient believed herself pregnant; but it is not un- common in cases of extra-uterine gestation for a quasi men- strual discharge to appear once or twice after conception has occurred, and it is quite probable that the pregnancy began earlier than May. Had the case been diagnosed at its commencement, or had the interior of the uterus been explored when the discharge first appeared, it is of course possible that abdominal section might have been success- fully adopted ; but at the time when she was admitted into the hospital I do not think any treatment could have saved her. So far as I have ascertained by reference to authori-

ALCOHOLIC PARALYSIS. 375 syncope, for which a small quantity of brandy was given her. During the night she slept well and in the morning had rallied somewhat. The grasping power of the hands, however, was very feeble, and she passed her motions involuntarily. On Feb. 9th it was noted that the hearths first sound was murmur-like and rough. Her general appearance was improved although the cough was still troublesome and the breathing laboured and rapid. Next day (Feb. 10th) she was much worse ; the breath- ing was still rapid (32) and shallow ; she had a wild appearance with flushed cheeks, glistening eyes, lips dry, and covered with sordes ; the tongue also was dry and fissured and coated with a thick yellow fur ; pulse 126, small, feeble, and irregular.

The cord itself was firm throughout. On section the grey

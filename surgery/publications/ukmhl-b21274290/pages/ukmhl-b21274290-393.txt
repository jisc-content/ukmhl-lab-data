A CASE OF ANEURISM AT THE ROOT OF THE NECK AND IN THE UPPER PART OF THE CHEST IN A VERY ADVANCED STAGE TEEATED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF STEEL WIRE. BY JOHN WHITAKER HULKE, F.R.S., SUEGEON TO THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL. Received March 23rdâ€”Read April 12ili, 1887. The number of cases of aneurism treated by the intro- duction of foreign substances into their cavity with the intention of inducing coagulation of the blood they contain in a mechanical way is yet so small that this plan of treat- ment must be considered as still upon trial. No final consensus of opinion can be expected respecting its reme- dial value until much larger experience of it has been gained. At present widely different estimates are held of the benefits that may reasonably be expected from it, of the risks to which it exposes the patient, of the relative value of the different materials which have been or may be used, and some technical points in the procedure are doubtless susceptible of improvement.

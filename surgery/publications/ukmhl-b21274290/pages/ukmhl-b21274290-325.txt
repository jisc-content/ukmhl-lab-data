GOUTY PAROTITIS AND GOUTY ORCHITIS. 221 mother both suffered from gout. When twenty-eight years of age he underwent an operation for incurved toe- nail, and the toe was rendered insensible to pain by the application of the ether spray. Shortly afterwards his first attack of gout declared itself in this toe, recurring two years later and subsequently affecting both feet and both elbows. In March, 1885, the patient suddenly became aware of a swelling of the left testicle accom- panied by acute pain, without any history of a traumatic or urethral origin. This swelling involved the testicle as well as the epididymis. The testicle was three times its natural size and the swelling was general; there was no effusion into the tunica vaginalis ; it was moderately tender on pressure, but was the seat of intense shooting pain. Poultices, belladonna fomentations and position, failed to effect any improvement in the patient^s condition until the swelling suddenly disappeared on the supervention of an attack of gout in the big toe. I am sorry now that I did not at once have recourse to colchicum as I did in the case of my patients suffering from gouty parotitis. In the various observations published by medical authors we remark in most cases the alternations which I have already pointed out with reference to parotid gout—the left testicle and the right foot—for in all the cases hitherto published the left testicle has been the sufferer. This rule, however, is not absolute since in the case of my other patient, the right testicle and the right foot were affected. I may add that so far I have never met with gouty mani- festations in the testicle and in the parotid in the same patient.

In the case of the third patient, iodide of potassium did not appear to do any good, and bromide of potassium and chloral, instead of making her quieter and producing sleep, seemed to have the opposite effect. Further than this, she has had strychnia in gradually increasing doses for many weeks, to the extent of ten minims of liquor strychnia every six hours, and latterly cod-liver oil, with faradism and rubbing to the wasted muscles. Probably the benefit she has received has resulted more from the withdrawal of alcohol than from any more direct element of treatment, and it has been a favorable point in her case that she has always been able to take food well.

50 AN EXPOSTULATION AGAINST THE thy divine providence forseest and disposest all thinges to thy glory, and the profite of thy Churche. Thou seest all thinges before they come to pass, and thinges that yet are not are with thee as though they were; but man thou hast inclosed within metes and boundes of knowyng thinges after they are chanced, so that we only judge of thinges present, and as for thynges to come, we can not before hande certenly decerne them.

Graunt this, 0 Lorde God, eternall and omnipotent, for the sake of thy everlasting word, thy dere Sonne,

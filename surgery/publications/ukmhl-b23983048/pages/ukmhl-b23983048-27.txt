Non purgat pectus quod comprimit segra senectus; Lenit pulinonem, pui-gat laterum regionem ; Apostema frangit, si locum bibita taugit: Tribus uncta foris anthracem liberat horis. To Urbane him selfe, it is uncertaine Howe many vertues in scabiose reygne : But excellently it clenseth the breste Of sicke aged folke, that there are opreste. The pypes of the lunges, if rough they apere, It maketh them smothe, yea gentle and clere ; The roumes of the breste, that we the sydes call. It purgeth well, from incumbrances all. K it be drunke, so that it touche the place, Apostemes it breakes, by peculiar grace; Without to carbuncles if it layde be, It doth lose and breake them within howres three."

Q.—Grigge the Poulter. In the reign of Edward VI, Grigg, a poulterer in Sun-ey, was put in the pillory at Croydon and again in Southwark, for cheating people out of their money by pretending to cure them by charms, or by looking at them, or by casting their water. (Gentle- man's Magazine, Vol. xxxiii. p. 105). Many other quacks have at various tunes been also subjected to punish- ment.—Anthony was punished for his Aurum Potabile ; Arthm- Dee for advertising medicines to cure all diseases; Foster for selling a powder for the cure of chlorosis; Tenant, an urine caster, who sold pills at £6 each; Aires for selling purging sugar plums; Hunt for putting up bills for the cure of diseases in the streets. The Council in the reign of James I despatched a warrant to the Magistrates of the City of London, to take up all reputed empirics, and cause them to be examined by the censors of the Royal College of Physicians. Several were taken up and acknowledged their ignorance; Lamb, Reed, Wood- house, &c. In the reign of King William, Fairfax was fined and imprisoned for doing injury to persons by his Aqua Coelestis. And in Stow's Chronicle it is recorded that a water caster was punished for exercising his quack- ery. He was set on horseback, his face to the horse's tail, which he held in his hand, with a collar of minals about his neck, led by the hangman through the city, whipped, branded, and then banished.

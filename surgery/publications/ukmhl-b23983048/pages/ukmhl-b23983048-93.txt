NOTES. 67 p. 2«, 1. 28.—Maister BuUeyne. William Bulleyn, or Bul- lein, was a learned physician, bom about the year 1500, in the Isle of Ely. He was intimately versed in the writings of the Greek and Arabian physicians, and he travelled over various parts of England and Scotland, to acquire botanical knowledge. He studied both at Cam- bridge and at Oxford, and was an ecclesiastic as well as a physician. He was rector of Blaxliall, in Suffolk, where he preached divinity, and practised physic. Upon the accession of Queen Mary, being a protestant, he thought it best to retire from his rectory, and he removed to Durham; where he became intimate with Sir Thomas Hilton, governor of Tinmouth Fort, engaged with him in a commercial speculation, and had occasion, also, to attend upon him in an attack of malignant fever, of which he died. Bulleyn was pm-sued and charged, by the bro- ther of the governor, with the mui'der of his relative, but of this he was honourably acquitted. He was, however, detained in prison for a debt, and during his incarceration composed his medical works, which are distinguished by learning, fancy, and humour. They consist of "The Governement of Helthe," "A Comfortable Regimen against the Pleurisie ;" Bulwarke of Defense against all Sicknes, Sornes, and Wounds, that doe daily as- saulte Mankind;" and " A Dialogue both pleasaunt and pietieful against the Fever Pestilence." He was elected into the Royal College of Physicians of London, and had a great practice. He died in 1576. P. 27,1. 13.—For where as before thyne errors ivere espied.

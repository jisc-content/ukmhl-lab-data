NOTES. 69 P. 42,1. 17.â€”Good Doctor Record. Robert Recorde, doctor of medicine, is a person of whom we have to regret that but few biographical particidars are known. My friend Mr. James Orchard Halliwell has, in an interesting little tract on "The connexion of Wales with the early science of England," published by Rodd in 1840, col- lected together several circumstances which show that he is to be regarded as the first original writer on arithmetic in English ; the first on geometry; the first person who introduced the knowledge of algebra into England; the first writer on astronomy in English; the first person in this country who adopted the Copernican system; the inventor of the present method of extracting the square root; the inventor of the sign of equality; and the in- ventor of the method of extracting the square root of multinomial algebraic quantities.

His will, from which Mr. Halliwell has given some extracts, bears the date of June 28, 1558, and he therein styles himself as "sicke in body, yet whole in mynde."

viii THE BOOKES VERDICT. As some delighte moste to beholde, Eche newe devyse and guyse, So some in workes of fathers olde, Their studies exercise. Perusing with all diligence Bokes written long before : Wherin they learne experience, To heale both sicke and sore ; Which I alowe in dede and werde, In those that understande ; For otherwyse it is a sworde Put in a mad mans hande. Let idiotes and betles blynde, Therefore lay me aparte : Leste contrarie myne author's mynde They rudly me perverte. For as the bee doth honie take From every goodly flowre, And spyders of the same doe make Veuim that wyll devoure : So all that learned men and wyse To good purpose can use, The rude, that knowledge doe despise, Will ever more abuse. Wherefore all those that use me right I shall increase their fame: And vyle abusers all my mighte Shall be to doe them shame. ft

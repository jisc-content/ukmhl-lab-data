xxiii hym their superiors? No, truly. The body of man is a common weale without rebellion: the kyng so lovyng his subjectes, and the subjectes so lovyng their kyng, that the one is ever redy to mynister unto the other all thynges nedeful; as if the harte by any occasion susteyne damage, as we may see in the disease called 8incope, or swoundyng. At suche a tyme I saye the face, the handes, and the fete, are founde colde and without felynge, strengthe or lyfe; and what proveth it, but that as lovynge and obedient subjectes they thynke nothyng theyr own wherof the harte hath nede, which is their lorde and governour; yea, they utterly depryve themselves of altogether to serve and please their lord. Immediately as the swoundyng ceaseth, the blonde resorteth to the face, the handes and the feete are warme agayne, as it were benefittes done, rendered agayne with thankes and joye. And is not such a lorde and kyng worthye of good subjectes, that for the helpe of one' of the leaste of them wyl spend all that he hath, so long as lyfe endureth ? as if a member be hurte, wherby any veyne or artery is cutte, the blonde or spirit will issue in suche wyse that it wyll not cease commyng thyther so longe as any is lefte, if it be not in tyme prevented. Oh kynd and gentyll governour, oh wel wyllyng and obe- dient subjectes."

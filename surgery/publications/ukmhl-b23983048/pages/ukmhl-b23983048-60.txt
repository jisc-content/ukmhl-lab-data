24 AN EXPOSTULATION AGAINST THE a cancer may in dede be ulcerate, and is often so; but that every ulcer may by rankling (as thou saiest) be- come a cancer, it hath not been redde nor seen. But then he sayde that he spake of a canker, and not of a cancer; for a cancer, sayde he, is when an ulcer stynketh. Muche more could I wryte of his beastly answeres, if I thought this not enough, yea, to much, except it weare better. And though I thinke this enough to greve any wyse mans eyes to see, or eares to heare, yet shall I desyre them to beare with a worde or twayne more, that what they are, even the unskilfull may per- ceive, and learne to beware of them. A certaine pacient of myne, (having lately been cured at my hande), metynge with this Nicols at his brothers house, reasoned with hym of a payne that he sometyme hadde in his hyppe ; I trowe, quod he, ye cal it a sciatica, doe ye not ? Yea, sayde Nicols, there is a sciatica, and a sciitica. Then sayde my pacient, I never hearde my chyrurgien name any suche. Who is that, sayde Nicols ? and my pacient named me. Then began Nicols to praise a neighbour of myne, sai- yng that he was cunuinger then I, but my pacient praysed me to be cunninger then my neighbour. Yea, sayd Nicols, in talke, Halle can talke better. Then sayde my paciente, I hadde a grevous sore legge, with greate apostemacions and hoUownes, wlierefore if he coulde have done nothing but talke, he myght have talked long enough to my legge before it would so have been whole.

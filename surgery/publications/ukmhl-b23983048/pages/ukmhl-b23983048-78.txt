42 AN EXPOSTULATION AGAINST THE sythe they are both partes one of an other, how can they be devided or separate wythout detriment to them bothe ? for it is not a whole body that lacketh one of hys cliiefe" members, or partes ; for nether can chirurgerye be perfectlye learned wythoute theorike, nor phisike wythoute practise. And wheras theorike and practise goe not together, whether ye call it phi- sike or chirurgery, I dare boldlye afiu-me, that there is in them no manner of perfection worthy commenda- tion. Yet some there be that thinke that onlye to phisike belongeth theorike, or speculation, and that to chirurgery belongeth onlye practise; but howe farre their judgementes differ from truthe, let everye wyse man judge.

Whiche addition we put to, because it never hath beu, is, nor shalbe possi-

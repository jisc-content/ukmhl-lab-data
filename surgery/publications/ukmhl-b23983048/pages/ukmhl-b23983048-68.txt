AN EXPOSTULATION AGAINST THE See that thou laye disdeyne aside, And pride of thyne owne skyll: And thinke no shame counsell to take, But rather wyth good wyll Gette one or two of experte men, To helpe thee in that nede; And make them partakers wyth thee. In that worke to procede. For in so doinge, thine honestye Thou shalte well kepe and save; Also thy patiente therby Righte greate comforte shall have. By thys meanes thou mayste haplye learne, Ryghte seldome sene before ; Of thee, or hym, whyche fyrste thee taughte, Thoughe thou have cunnynge store. And also if oughte goe a wrye, Or hinder in thy cure. The one maye mende the others faulte, While frendship dothe endure. The wounded or sore man also, Shall have no cause to grudge In you suche uniformitye, Whyle he maye see and judge.

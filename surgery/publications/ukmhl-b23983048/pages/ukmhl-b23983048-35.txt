xxvii pans, and made therewithal a noble salve, as they did term it. But in the end this worthy rabble- ment was committed to the Marshalsea, and threat- ened by the duke's grace to be hanged for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth what they were, and of what occupations, and in the end they did confess, as I have declared to you before." The Bodleian Library contains a MS. (178), being a translation by J. H. of Bened. Victo- rius's " Cure of the French Disease"; also some letters between J. H. and Dr. William Ouning- ham, dated 1565. The latter is well known by his " Cosmographical Glasse, containing the pleasant principles of Cosmographie, Greographie, Hydrographie, or Navigation, London, 1559, folio." Many of the cuts of this work were executed by the author, who is reported to have been ingenious in the art of engraving on copper; the map of ' Norwhich' is his own production. The work is one of the finest that issued from the press of Day. Mr. Halliwell tells me that a few years ago he saw the original MS. of this work at Denley's, a book- seller, near Drury Lane. Dr. Cuningham resided at Norwich about 1556-59, and afterwards in Lon- don, where he was appointed to read the lectures at Surgeon's Hall, in 1563. He commented on the book of Gralen upon " Tumours against Nature."

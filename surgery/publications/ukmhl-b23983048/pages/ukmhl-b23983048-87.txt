ABUSERS OF CHYRURGERIE AND PHYSYKE. 61 our only Saviour and Mediatour, by whome thou work- est aU in all tliynges, who lyveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God in trinitie, and tri- nitie in unitie, worlde without end. Amen. Nowe that after my symple skill I have formed praiers mete for chirurgiens, I thinke it mete to shew also an example howe to prayse God for the good successe of the chirurgiens busines, as foloweth. O ETERN ALL father, almyghtie God, maker of al things, howe great and glorious are all thy wonderous workes, thy lovyng kyndnes and mercies to mankynde excedynge them all, for thy benefites bestowed on mankynde are infinite and incomparable. Among whiche thy crea- tures and workes of thy handes, I, moste poore unwor- thy man, and wretched sinner, have endlesse cause to acknowledge thy grace and mercies. If, oh Lord, I should once imagin to gratifie thy goodnes, beholde what hath mortal man to geve unto God ? or what hath man that is not Gods ? neyther hast thou, 0 God, any nede of man, or ought that man hath. But not withstandyng, thy Sonne our Saviour, by divyne providence, hath satisfied for us thy wyll, and apeased thy wrath, justly bente on us for our ma- nifold sinnes, and through the Holy Ghoste, thy spirit of truthe, (who leadeth us unto aU truthe), we are in- formed that thou askeste of us from henceforthe no more, but a lyvely sacrifice of thaukes gevyng and prayse of thy holy name.

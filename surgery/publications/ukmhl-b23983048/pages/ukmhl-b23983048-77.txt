ABUSERS OF CHYRURGERIR AND PHYSYKE. 41 fullye in liartye contemplacions daye and nighte, desir- inge God for Jesus Cliristes sake, hys dei'e Sonne oure Savyoui'e, to enspire tliee wytli suche grace, that thou maiste to his honor and glory, ende all suche enter- prises as thou takest upon thee to doe; (of whyche prayer I will hereafter wryte an example), for if God be on thy syde, feare not who so ever be agaynst thee. And that thou mayste the better knowe what thou doste, that wilt be a chirurgien, and what thou takest upon thee to professe, knowe oute of good and learned authores, what chirurgerye is, and so shalte thou be the better able wiselye to worke alone, where the nedefuU Society of counseU dothe wante. Chirurgery, therefore, (as Angelus Bolognius in the prologe to his boke of the cure of externall ulcers, sayeth), is the moste aunciente, ye the moste sure and excellente parte of the arte of medicyne, whiche work- eth by handy operation. For the name thereof whiche was geven thereto by moste auncyent authores, signi- fieth nothynge elsse; for chirurgery is Operatio Man- ualis, that is handye worke. Wherfore feyth it is a parte of phisike, we can not so rightlye name it in Englishe, as to call it the handye worke of medicine. And farthermore the arte of medicine or phisicke, (wherin chirui-gery is comprehended), is an arte, and so it oughte to be named, and not a science; and chi- rui-gery is not an arte properlye of it selfe wythoute phisike, or seperated from the same, as some doe thinke; neyther can phisike be an whole and perfecte arte wythout chirurgery, as some woulde imagin.

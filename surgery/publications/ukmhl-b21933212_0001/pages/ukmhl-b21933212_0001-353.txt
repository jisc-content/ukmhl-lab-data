325 TALIPES EQUINUS makes the tendon prominent by dorsi-flexing the foot whilst the puncture in the sk\n is being made ; as soon as this has been done, however, the tendon is relaxed by depressing the front of the foot in order to enable the surgeon to insinuate his knife more readily between it and the skin. The surgeon ascertains the progress of his knife as he insinuates it between the skin and the back of the tendon by means of his left fore-finger, and makes sure that no tendinous fibres are left between the knife and the skin (see Fig. 102). When the point has been passed well across to the opposite border of the tendon, the cutting edge is turned forward, and then the e Fig. 103.â€”Diagram showing the Structures needing Division in Talipes Equino-varus.

Before with- drawing his knife, the surgeon should ascertain with his left fore-finger that there are no other tight structures requiring division ; sometimes the sheath of the tendon is also contracted and requires to be nicked. The principal reason for dividing the tendo Achillis at the spot recommended, namely an inch above its insertion into the os calcis, is that division at a lower point is not always satisfactory, because a series of tendinous slips are often given off at about that spot, to be inserted into the upper part of the OS calcis, and proper relaxation of the tendon will not occur if they escape di\-ision. When the tendon has been divided, the foot should be

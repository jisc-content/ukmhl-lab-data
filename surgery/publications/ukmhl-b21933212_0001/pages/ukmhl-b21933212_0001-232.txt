204 CHAPTER X. AFFECTIONS OF CICATRICES. CHELOID. Although the cicatrix is usually healthy when union by first intention has occurred, this is not invariably the case, and when a large wound has been allowed to heal by granulation, the scar left is often unsatis- factory. In either case the condition known as false cheloid or thickened cicatrix may be met with. The cicatrix becomes thickened and raised above the surface of the surrounding skin ; when the scar is linear there is a hard raised bar of this cheloid material, corresponding to the line of incision, and when it is a broad one the affection generally begins at the junction of the skin with the cicatricial tissue, and spreads thence through the rest of the scar. When the scar is broad, a most unsightly deformity is produced, as the surrounding parts are pulled upon and puckered up. The scar does not yield as ordinary scar tissue should, and the cheloid itself is painful, and liable to become ulcerated. CAUSES.—The cause of this condition is by no means clear. Small cheloids are sometimes found on the back of the wrists, produced by the chafing of the patient's cuffs, and there is a type of cheloid found over the manubrium sterni—Alibert's cheloid—which does not seem to be associated with a wound. It is probable that slight sepsis is a factor in the production of cheloid in many cases ; for example, after operations in which slight infection has been suspected and a drainage-tube has been used, it is not uncommon to find a cheloid scar at the site of the drainage-tube, while that of the rest of the wound is quite supple. It is most common after operations on tuberculous patients, though there is no evidence that the affection is tuberculous, and in these patients it is not uncommon to find that every scar—even down to a pin- or needle-prick—becomes cheloid. The microscope reveals simply a large number of young cells and granulation-tissue.

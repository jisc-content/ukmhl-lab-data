DEFORMITIES 2g6 is the same as before, and the after-treatment is identical with that for the subcutaneous operation (see p. 293). The immediate result of this operation is usually satisfactory, but here, as in the former case, the contraction tends to recur. CONTRACTIONS AFTER BURNS. It is not uncommon, especially in young children, to meet with con- traction of the fingers as a result of the cicatricial contraction following A Fig. 90.—Operation for Contracted finger after a Burn. A shows the in- cisions for raising the lateral flaps ; the portion between them is dissected out. B shows the finger straightened after this has been done. The flaps are sutured together tliroughout most of their extent, the triangular raw surfaces left above and below being covered by skin-grafts. upon burns. The condition is of the greatest importance because of the resulting uselessness of the hand. The burns are generally produced by grasping something red-hot, such as a poker, or falling on to the bars of a grate, and burning the palmar surface of the fingers. The result is a granulating wound which, when cicatrisation is complete, gives rise to ridges of cicatricial tissue extending from the palmar surface of the tips of the fingers to the palm, the fingers becoming flexed and rigid from the contraction of the scar. TREATMENT.—The deformity is difficult to remedy. If the bands be divided transversely, recurrence of the contraction will take place almost inevitably as the wound heals, and the deformity will be

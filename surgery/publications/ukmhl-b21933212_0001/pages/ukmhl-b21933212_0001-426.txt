396 DEFORMITIES anterior part of the capsule be stretched or divided, the head of the bone will go into the rudimentary acetabulum and then the limb can be im- mobilised in that position. The following are the stages of the procedure as practised by Lorenz. First of all the head must be brought down to the level of the aceta- bulum, next the adductors must be so stretched that they are incapable of reproducing the deformity, then the capsule must be detached from the front of the acetabulum and finally the head of the bone must be brought Fig. 137.â€”LoRENz's Non-operative Method for Congenital Dislocation of THE Hip. First Stage. While an assistant makes counter-extension by a perineal band, the surgeon forcibly pulls down the head of the bone until it is opposite the acetabulum. The traction is made outwards as well as downwards, so as to stretch the adductors. over the rudimentary acetabulum, where it is kept until the head has enlarged it sufficiently to estabhsh a stable joint on which the patient may walk without the dislocation recurring. We shall describe the treatment of a case of unilateral dislocation; although the steps of the treatment are similar for both unilateral and bilateral forms, the former condition is much more easy to treat because the patient possesses one sound limb on which to support himself when walking becomes necessary. The child is anaesthetised, and forcible extension is made upon the thigh so as to bring the trochanter down to the level of Nelaton's line, while counter-extension is exerted by a well-padded perineal band. The more important part of the procedure consists in over-stretching or actually rupturing the shortened adductors, and thereby paralysing them and

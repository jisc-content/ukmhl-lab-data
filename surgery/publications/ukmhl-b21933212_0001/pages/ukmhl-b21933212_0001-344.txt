3i6 DEFORMITIES treatment should be continued for several years at least after apparently complete recovery. In the eases in which it is possible to get the foot into position without :the exercise of any force, the treatment wiU consist in the methodical employment of manipulations, so as to keep the parts stretched, and the adoption of means designed to strengthen the action of any muscles that may be deficient in power; besides this, the bony deformity which already exists must be corrected, and prevented from recurring. The first two objects are attained by the use of suitable manipulations and massage, whilst for the third some form of apparatus must be employed. B AC Fig. 100.â€”Metal Talipes Splint. A shows the splint before application. B illus- trates the splint applied to the foot while still in its faulty position. The splint is easily made to fit the foot by bending the stout copper connecting wire a. C shows the faulty position of the foot rectified by bending the splint back into the position shown in A, while the foot is firmly fixed to It. When congenital club-foot is detected early enough to be remediable by the hand, the position of the foot should be over-corrected several times a day. It is of great advantage that this correction should be carried out, in the first instance at any rate, by the medical man himself; it should be done by grasping the anterior half of the foot with one hand and gently, firmly, and slowly bringing it into its proper position, whilst the posterior half is fixed by the other hand. It is essential that these manipulations should be carried out without using any force, as spasm of the muscles is at once set up if it be done roughly ; this interferes with the proper replacement, and soon teaches the child

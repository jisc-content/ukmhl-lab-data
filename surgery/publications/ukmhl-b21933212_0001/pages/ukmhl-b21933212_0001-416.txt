386 CHAPTER XIX. CURVATURES OF THE NECK OF THE FEMUR, Certain deformities result from alterations in the normal curvatures of the neck of the femur and are generally divided into two groups called respectively Coxa Vara and Coxa Valga. COXA VARA. CAUSES.â€”This deformity is met with at two periods of life; in infants or young children of three or four and in young adults between the ages of thirteen and eighteen. It is said that the affection is sometimes congenital. There is considerable uncertainty as to the exact etiology of the disease ; it is possible that the deformity occurs in infants as the result of some malposition in utero, as it is difficult to account for it on the ground of any faulty position assumed by the child while lying down or being carried in arms. There is no doubt, however, that in the great majority of cases the deformity in young children results from softening of the bones due to rickets. It is also highly probable that a large number of cases in young adults owe their origin to the condition that goes by the name of ' rachitis adolescentium.' In some of the adult cases, however, no signs of rickets are to be traced, and these have been attributed to rheumatoid arthritis, to osteitis, or to other causes ; the affection may certainly supervene upon a mild attack of rheumatism. The deformity in adults generally occurs n those whose occupations involve continuous and prolonged standing or carrying of heavy weights. By soijie it is held that the disease is more common in young adults than in infants, but this is very doubtful; certainly, since our attention has been directed to the point, we have found a large number of cases in young rickety children. Indeed careful examination of rickety children with knock-knees will show a certain amount of curvature of the neck of the femur in the majority of cases. This can possibly be explained as a deformity compensatory to the knock-knees, in which condition there is

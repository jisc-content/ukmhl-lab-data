CHAPTER VII. 132 THE TREATMENT OF INCISED WOUNDS. The great object of wound-treatment is to prevent the entrance of organisms into the wound, or, when this is impossible—as, for example, in operations about the mouth or the rectum—to hinder their growth, and thus minimise their evil effects. These objects are effected in two ways. The primary one is to disinfect the skin of the patient and the hands of the operator and his assistants, together with all the instruments and accessories used in the operation, so thoroughly that no organisms are thereby introduced into the wound. A secondary, but very important, object is to kill or inhibit the growth of any organisms that may accidentally gain access from any cause. CLASSIFICATION OF INCISED WOUNDS.—There are two great classes of incised wounds—viz. those made by the surgeon, and those inflicted before the patient is seen by him. Wounds made by the surgeon may be again subdivided into — {a} those made through un- broken skin and not communicating with mucous surfaces ; {b) those made in connection with previously existing sinuses or suppurating deposits, or communicating with some mucous canal. The importance of this subdivision is that, while it is comparatively easy to exclude micro-organisms from wounds of the first class, it is always difficult and may be impossible to do so in the second variety ; the treatment in the latter must therefore be directed towards minimising the ill-effects pro- duced by the organisms after they have gained entrance. TREATMENT OF WOUNDS MADE BY THE SURGEON THROUGH UNBROKEN SKIN. It is clear from what has gone before that the point to be aimed at here is healing by first intention. If this be obtained, there is rapid recovery, and a delicate scar is left, which becomes practically invisible later on, while the general septic affections or the local inflammatory troubles which may occur if union by first intention be not obtained are avoided.

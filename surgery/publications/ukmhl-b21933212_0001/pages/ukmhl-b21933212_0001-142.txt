114 WOUNDS to allow the blood to be mixed thoroughly with the saline solution. The original source of bleeding must be controlled in all cases either by B c Fig. 30.—Intka-venous Infusion.—(A) The vein has been exposed and its sheath opened ; two ligatiures have been passed beneath it, the distal one of which has been tied, the upper one being left around the vein at tlie opposite extremity of the wound. The wall of the vein has been pinciied up with a pair of fine forceps and a V-shaped incision is about to be made into the wall of the vein with a pair of scissors. (B) The incision has been made, the forceps retaining their original hold upon the wall of the vein, which has been lifted up so as to expose and stretch the opening. (C) A canula has been passed into the opening in the vein and along its lumen for a short distance, its position beneath the skin at the upper end of the wound being indicated by tlie dotted lines. The second ligature has been tied in a single knot around the canula and is ready to occlude the vein when the canula is withdrawn. ligature or pressure, othei-wise the rise in blood pressure following the infusion may start a fresh and fatal haemorrhage. It may be necessary to repeat the infusion in an hour or so when much blood has been lost.

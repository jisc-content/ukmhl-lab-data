185 CHAPTER IX. INFECTIVE DISEASES OF WOUNDS. In the preceding chapters we have laid the very greatest stress on the aseptic management of the wound, but no consideration of the subject would be complete unless reference were made to the various results which may ensue either when these precautions have not been taken, or when they have been carried out inefficiently. It must be remembered, in connection with the various septic diseases that may attack wounds, that although such affections as septic intoxica- tion, traumatic fever, septicaemia, and pyaemia are described as different conditions possessing clearly differentiated symptoms and a definite patho- logy, yet in actual practice there are numerous gradations between them, so that it is often impossible to say where one ends and the other begins. Thus a condition of septic intoxication readil}^ passes into one of traumatic fever, which in its turn may end in one of the forms of septicaemia or of pyaemia. Even septicaemia and pyaemia, which are the two members of the group that differ most widely, may both occur as the result of the septic infection of the same wound. Indeed, seeing that in all probability the same organisms are concerned in most of these affections, it is not illogical to regard the latter as being merely varieties of the one funda- mental condition of septic contamination, the particular form that the affection takes depending upon a variety of factors, such as the virulence and concentration of the infective material, the distribution of the organisms, and the anatomical conditions of the part affected. SEPTIC INTOXICATION. The organisms which gain access to wounds may be either sapro- phytes—i.e., those growing in dead tissues or in fluids, but having no power of penetrating into the living body ; or parasites—i.e. those which live and flourish in the bodies of animals whose tissues or fluids furnish suitable media for their development ; the latter group are usually capable

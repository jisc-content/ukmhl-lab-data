403 D D 2 CHAPTER XXI. KYPHOSIS: SCOLIOSIS. Under this heading are included the forms of spinal curvature which are not due to disease of the vertebra;, in contradistinction to the disease known as angular curvature or Pott's disease, which is due to a tuberculous affection. Two forms of functional curvature of the spine are met with in practice. The first is known as kyphosis, or general curvature of the spine; and although in time it may lead to the second and more serious form known as scoliosis, it is, as a rale, transient in nature and easy to treat. KYPHOSIS. In Infancy.—This is usually associated with considerable muscular weakness, and also with rickets. As a rule it is temporary, and disappears as the child grows stronger. In bad cases, however, especially in those with extensive rickets, the curvature persists, and the child grows up round-backed and stooping. The condition, if persistent, is very likely to become the starting-point of scoliosis, and therefore always requires treatment. A child who is the suliject of kyphosis has a constant tendency to sprawl upon the back, and is imable voluntarily to assume the sitting posture. When the child is sat up, the trunk is bunched forward and the spine is strongly bowed backwards, so that the chin often nearly touches the knees and the spine is bent forwards into one large C-like curve. There is no want of mobility of the spine, and usually no tenderness on pressure. The curvature disappears entirely when the child is laid flat on the back upon a hard level surface, except in advanced cases of long standing. There is no lateral curvature unless the kyphosis has persisted for a considerable time. In Adult Life.—Kyphosis in the adult is generally due to the habitual adoption of an exaggerated faulty position, such for instance as that

i84 WOUNDS of the skin, and a short delay may prove that amputation is not called for. In any case, there is no guide to the proper place for amputation until a line of demarcation has formed, for it is impossible to say at first to what extent the tissues have been irretrievably damaged. As soon, however, as there is a clear indication of the extent of the frostbite, there is no necessity to wait any longer, and amputation may be proceeded with at once. In most cases of frostbite of the foot, a Chopart's or Syme's amputation will suffice ; it is seldom that the gangrene reaches the ankle. If, however, the surgeon wait too long, the gangrene is apt to spread (as is the case with the senile form), the weak tissues being unable to resist the inflammation associated with the separation of the dead part. On the other hand, if the amputation be performed anti- septically, no further inflammation occurs, and there is no gangrene of the flaps. Thus, by waiting too long, more tissue may be lost than if the amputation were performed as soon as the appearance of a line of demarcation indicates the extent of the original gangrene. The general treatment of the third stage of frostbite is similar to that of the less severe forms (see p. 183).

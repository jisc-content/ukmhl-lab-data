CHAPTER VIII. PUNCTURED, CONTUSED, LACERATED, AND POISONED WOUNDS; BURNS, SCALDS, AND FROSTBITES. PUNCTURED WOUNDS. Characters.—A punctured wound is one made by a narrow instrument so that its superficial area is small in proportion to its depth ; there is generally a comparatively small opening in the skin leading into a large irregular wound in the deeper parts. The peculiar features of the punctured wound are due to the elasticity and contractility of the injured parts ; the elasticity of the skin tends to diminish the opening in it and, on the other hand, the contractility of the muscles beneath tends to increase the size of the wound in them. Results.—The results of punctured wounds depend largely on the particular structures injured. When no important structure has been wounded, the pain is usually slight and the haemorrhage trifling. If, however, an artery be punctured, profuse bleeding results ; this is the usual way in which a false aneurysm is produced. In punctured wounds of the abdominal wall, the instrument may penetrate the abdominal cavity and injure one of the viscera, and special symptoms will then occur, the characters and treatment of which are considered under affections of the particular organ in question. Further, if the instrument which caused the puncture pass through clothing, or if the puncture be in a hairy part, infective material is likely to be carried into the soft parts, and a septic wound may be produced. Treatment.—In all punctured wounds it is advisable to enlarge the aperture in the skin sufficiently to give thorough access to the deeper parts, which should be cleaned out, the blood-clots removed, and the haemorrhage arrested. The wound should then be washed out with a 1 in 20 carbolic acid solution, any divided muscle stitched together, and any other important injury to the deeper parts [e.g. division of nerves) repaired. When this has been done, the incision which the surgeon has i68

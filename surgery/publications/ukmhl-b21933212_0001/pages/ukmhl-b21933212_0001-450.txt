DEFORMITIES 420 is useful to have them performed against resistance, the simplest way of doing which is to instruct the attendant to oppose the movements which the patient is endeavouring to carry out, gently at first, and with gradu- ally increasing force as the muscles grow stronger. There are several forms of mechanical apparatus which are designed for the purpose of carrying out movements against resistance. Of these, Dowd's machine (see Fig. 146) is a useful type, whilst there are various other mechanical Fig. 144.—Scoliosis : Postural Treatment.

The patient makes extension upon the spine by pressing the ihac crests downwards. exercisers, such as Whiteley's, etc., in popular use. Dumb-bells are a means of doing the same thing in a minor degree. These simple movements are suited only for cases in which there is no permanent distortion of the spine—that is to say, those in which suspension of the patient causes the spine to become perfectly straight. As these exercises produce their effect and obliterate the curve, they may be gradu- ally abandoned in favour of more simple home-drill exercises designed to improve the muscular system generally (see p. 423) ; these should be practised at least once daily for a prolonged period.

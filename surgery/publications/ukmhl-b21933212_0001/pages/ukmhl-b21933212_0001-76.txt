INFLAMMATION AND ITS SEQUELS 48 only about a third of each is exposed. In this way the whole region of the ulcer, as well as the thickened tissues above and below, are firmly supported and pressed upon by a series of strips of adhesive plaster applied from below upwards. Before applying the strapping, the whole limb should be shaved, as otherwise great annoyance is caused to the patient when it is peeled off. One great objection to strapping is that the discharge from the ulcer is confined beneath it, and there undergoes decomposition, and consequently fresh ulceration occurs. The ulcer, therefore, should be Fig. 15.â€”Method of Strapping an Ulcer, A dressing has been applied over the ulcer, which is represented by a dotted outUne. disinfected before the strapping is applied, and boric lint should be placed over its surface so as to absorb and prevent the decomposition of fluids. Unless this be done, it will be necessary to cut away the lower parts of the strapping so as to allow the discharge to escape, a procedure which necessarily weakens it. The strapping should be renewed every second day unless there is much discharge, when it must be renewed daily. Strapping has now been largely abandoned in favour of the elastic bandage, that known as Martin's being the most suitable form. Martin's bandage is a thin sheet of pure rubber, cut into strips about three inches wide and of varying lengths ; this is wound around the limb, commencing at the ball of the toes and extending up as far as the knee. The best form is that containing a number of perforations to permit of evaporation ; otherwise the perspiration accumulates beneath the bandage and may set up a dermatitis.

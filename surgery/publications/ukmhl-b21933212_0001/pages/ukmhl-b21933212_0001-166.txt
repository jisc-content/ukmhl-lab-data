138 WOUNDS Halsted's Intra-dermic Suture.—Halsted has modified the buried suture by inserting a single silkworm-gut or catgut suture in the manner shown in Fig. 37. This method is, however, only suitable for short and straight incisions and requires a good deal of practice to per- form quickly and efficiently. A special long, slightly flexible needle is of advantage. Michel's Metal Clips. — These are small pieces of malle- able white metal bearing a small spike at each end. Before insertion of the suture these spikes project at right-angles to the long axis of the clip, but when the latter is bent into a semicircle they point inwards towards one another. The edges of the wound are held in apposition with two pairs of fine toothed forceps so as to produce a slight ridge with the incision at the top of it; the clip is then held in a special pair of dissecting-for- ceps (each blade being grooved to receive the ends of the clip) over the ridge, and the clip is bent by gentle pressure on the forceps so as to force the spikes lightly into the skin. If too great pressure be exerted in applying these clips there will be sloughing of the skin between their ends. The clips are inserted about half-an-inch apart along the whole length of the incision. The clips should be removed about the fifth day, preferably Fig. 38.—Michel's Cups.—The sketch shows both the method of applying the clips by pinching them up with Special forceps, and that of reniovini? them by inserting the special hooks and straightening them. —a- with the special instruments Fig. 39.-Removal of Michel's clips by Forceps.- _ Ordinary Spencer Wells's forceps can be used, but special sold for the purpose; if these forceps, shown in the figure, are made for the purpose., be not available, one blade of a Spencer Wells's forceps may be passed into the concavity of the clip and the blades closed ; this flattens out the clip and so liberates its points.

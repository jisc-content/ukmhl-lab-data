385 GENU RECURVATUM satisfactory result. In them the patella is often absent and in any case it is small. The treatment should be directed to straightening the knee first, and afterwards an attempt should be made to obtain ffexion by the use of apparatus. A posterior splint is fixed to the thigh reaching down as far as the upper part of the popliteal space, and the limb is laid upon an inclined plane which terminates just above the knee. Extension by weight and pulley is then applied to the limb. At first the extension should be in the line of the thigh, so as merely to stretch the ligaments, but in two or three weeks the pulley may be gradually lowered so as to produce an increasing amount of flexion, the thigh remaining fixed in the elevated position. In very bad cases all attempts to obtain flexion may fail ; they must not be too energetic, as otherwise a true anterior dislocation of the leg may occur. When the muscles and ligaments are shortened, only operative interference will overcome the trouble ; this consists in lengthening the quadriceps extensor through a cm^ved incision with its convexity upwards about four inches above the knee joint. A flap is turned down, and the muscle is divided in a V-shaped or zig-zag manner, by the method described for lengthening muscles (see Vol. II.). At the same time all tense fibrous structures interfering with flexion of the limb are divided by a tenotomy knife. The treatment is a prolonged one, and when the patient begins to walk, he must be fitted with an apparatus designed to prevent over-exten- sion at the knee joint. This has irons running down both sides of the thigh and leg, fastened to a pelvic band above and the heel of the boot below, and has joints opposite the hip, knee and ankle joints ; the knee joint hinge is furnished with a stop to prevent over-extension.

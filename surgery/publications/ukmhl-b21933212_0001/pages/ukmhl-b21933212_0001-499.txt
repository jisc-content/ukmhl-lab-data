ADMINISTRATION IN SPECIAL CASES 469 with which the bellows should be worked must be directly proportionate to the freedom of respiration. In extensive operations upon the base of the tongue, etc., when preliminary tracheotomy is advisable, a Hahn's or Trendelenburg's tampon is sometimes inserted (Fig. 212), the anaesthesia being then maintained through the tracheal opening. By some surgeons laryn- gotomy is preferred in these cases. No tampon is used, and the anaes- thetic is administered through the tube by means of a Junker's inhaler and tube attachment. Patients with enlarged thy- roids are very liable to sudden attacks of syncope while taking anaesthetics, but, on the other hand, it is really remarkable what a very small quantity of anaesthetic will suffice to keep such patients thoroughly under. In thyroidectomies, therefore, I frequently use a Junker's apparatus throughout, giving but very Httle of the anaes- thetic, only just enough to restrain the retching and vomiting to which such patients appear to be particiilarly prone.

In all these operations about the head and neck, some trouble is experienced in preventing the hair from falling into the wound, and in

FLAT FOOT 305 border of the sole rests upon it along a line about an inch from one edge (see Fig. 91). The lint is then wrapped round the foot, covering in the heel behind and extending as far forward as the cleft between the toes; it should reach up just above the internal malleolus, but should not overlap the dorsal sur- face to any extent. This covering is allowed to set, and when the plaster is hard there is no difficulty in remov- ing the foot from it. A fresh lot of plaster is now made and some tow is mixed in with it. The mould is well oiled, and the mixture of plaster and tow is laid in it and arranged so that it fills the mould but does not project beyond it in any direc- tion. When the plaster mixture has set, the sides of the mould are forced aside and the cast is removed and marked for the instru- ment - maker. This method of making a cast is much simpler than that described by Whitman and is equally serviceable ; an excel- lent cast can be pro- duced by it without having recourse to skilled assistance. The brace is made of thin steel 1 and should extend forwards to the line of the metatarso- phalangeal joint of the great toe and backwards to the centre of the heel ; on the inner side of the foot it extends upwards to half an inch below the internal malleolus and on the outer side grasps the foot just behind the prominence formed by the fifth metatarsal. It should be ' It may also be made of aluminium or phosphor-bronze ; these materials do not rust. I. X ^^^^^ Fig. 95.â€”Whitman's Brace.

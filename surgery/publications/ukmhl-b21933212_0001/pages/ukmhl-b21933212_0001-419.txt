COXA VARA 389 limbs can be made simultaneously by a weight and pulley at the end of the bed. This transverse bar is designed to keep the limbs in the requisite position of abduction during extension, while its extremities provide fixed points about which the limbs can be rotated so as to overcome the rotation outwards. This is done by fastening to the hooks (^7) an elastic door spring of suitable strength which thus pulls the toes together while the heels remain separated by the transverse bar (r). The apparatus must be firmly fastened to the limb by including it in the folds of a plaster of Paris bandage (see Fig. 134). The weight used for extension should be Fig. 134. Extension Apparatus for Co.xa Vara applied. The iron bars are in- corporated in tlic layers o( a plaster of Paris bandage so tliat tlie limbs are immovably fixed to them. Extension is made with the limbs abducted and well rotated inwards. The extension is applied in a somewhat upward direction to avoid the friction caused by the heavy splint lying flat on the bed. three or four pounds to commence with, according to the size of the child ; it may be increased later. The apparatus should be renewed about once a fortnight, as it is liable to become soiled with urine. When this is done, the limb should be massaged, and it is well to practise repeated inversion, flexion, and adduction, before the splint is re-applied. The results obtained by this method are often surprisingly good and ver}- rapid. It would therefore appear that at any rate some part of the deformity and incapacity from which the child suffers must be due to muscular action, for it is obvious that extension and traction could not produce any profound change in the curvatures of the neck in so short a time. The extreme outward rotation may disappear in three weeks, although of course the elevation of the trochanter still remains, and will

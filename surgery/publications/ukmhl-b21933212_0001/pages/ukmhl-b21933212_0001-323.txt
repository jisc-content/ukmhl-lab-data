DEFORMITIES AFFECTING THE FINGERS AND TOES 295 should remain, as otherwise the scar which forms will materially hamper the progress of the case. If skin-grafting be used, a single graft should be employed if possible. The after-treatment is similar to that for sub- cutaneous division. In the other operation, a V-shaped incision is made in the palm and carried through both skin and fascia The apex of the V should be situated in the long axis of the finger which is most contracted and just above the transverse crease of the palm ; from this point incisions are carried downwards into the palm on each side, diverging from each Fig. 89.â€”The v Operation for Dupuytren's Contraction. A shows the hand after the incision has been made through the fascia, and the finger straightened. The raw surface thus left is closed by employing sutures in the manner shown in B. There is often a small raw surface left at the junction of the three limbs of the Y ; this should be covered by a skin-graft. other and ending about half an inch from tlie web (see Fig. 89, A). The incisions are carried through skin and fascia, the latter being completely divided, and no attempt is made to separate the two structures. The finger can then be extended without tearing or dividing any tight bands. After the finger has been brought straight, a large triangular wound is left in the palm, but this may be stitched together if the skin be supple, so that little or no raw surface is left. The sides of the wound are ap- proximated, and the apex of the V fits in between them where they diverge lower down (see Fig. 89, B), so that there may be complete closure of the wound. When the skin is not sufficiently elastic, a certain amount of raw surface is left, which should be covered immediately with a single skin-graft. The preliminary treatment of the palm, in order to render it supple,

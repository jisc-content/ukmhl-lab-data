362 DEFORMITIES the use of the Y-shaped plastic operation described on p. 295, and many of the tendons require lengthening (see Vol. II.). After the tendons have been divided, but before they have been sutured, the soft parts should be separated from the lower end of the ulna, and the bone made to protrude through the wound. The bone is divided lengthwise with a fine saw for about two inches, the plane of the saw cut being at right angles to that of the palm. A periosteum detacher is then inserted into the saw-cut and the two portions of bone forced apart ; this will cause one of them to undergo a greenstick fracture. At the carpal end of the cut the peri- osteum at the end of each portion of bone is now sutured by a stout catgut thread to the carpus ; one to the radial and one to the ulnar side. The divided and lengthened tendons are now sutured together and the wound closed as far as possible. If the wound cannot be completely closed it should be allowed to granulate and then skin-grafted. When heahng has taken place, the hand should be maintained in the same line with the fore- arm by encasing them in a tubular sheet of poroplastic felt extending from the middle of the forearm to the base of the fingers. The absence of the thumb makes the application of the splint quite simple. For the cases in which both bones are present, the most suitable treatment is by manipula- tion and massage combined with the use of the poroplastic splint as described above. The results of this treatment are, however, far from ideal as there is always a considerable amount of muscular weakness.

DEFORMITIES 370 may thus be fixed in any position that is most suitable. Any desired amount of inversion or eversion of the foot can be obtained by graduating the padding ; generally speaking, a large long pad should be applied opposite the point of greatest convexity of the curve that it is required to obliterate, and smaller thicker ones between the ends of the bones and the sides of the splint. The latter is then fastened round the limb by broad bandages, and the whole is laid upon an inclined plane to which it may be secured by a bandage. In about a week the stitches may be removed, and a collodion dressing applied. Any additional correction of the deformity may then be made, if necessary, under an aucesthetic, and the limb put up in the fully rectified position in a plaster of Paris or silicate bandage for another week or ten days; it is of course necessary that the foot should be strictly at right angles to the leg. As soon as the wound has healed, the case may be treated as one of a simple fracture in which there is no displacement of the fragments. The patient should be kept in bed with a fii"m sandbag on each side of the leg. Twice a day the leg is thoroughly massaged, and at the end of four weeks sufficient union will be found to have occurred to prevent any recurrence of the deformity. The child may now be allowed to sit up wearing the simple splints recommended above for the early stages of curvature, the splints being removed night and morning for massage. In this way it is possible to avoid the extreme muscular wasting which often follows osteotomy when the leg has been encased for months in a rigid plaster of Paris casing, and in addition, union of the divided bone takes place more rapidly. About six months after the operation the patient may be allowed to walk without any apparatus.

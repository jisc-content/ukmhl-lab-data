As a measure of pro- phylaxis, persons who must necessarily be exposed to severe cold should take large quantities of fatty food. The clothing should be thick and woollen, it should not be tight-fitting, and the feet especially should be kept warm ; the body, particularly the exposed parts, should be oiled in order to prevent evaporation, and when the patient is exposed to intense cold, he should keep actively moving, and must not yield to the desire to rest or sleep, which is often very great. Curative.—Of the First Stage.—When the cold has, so to speak, got hold of the patient, he should not be brought at once into a warm room, as otherwise the reaction is likely to be so great that thrombosis of the vessels occurs. The affected part should at first be rubbed with snow or cold water, while, after a little time, dry friction may be sub- stituted, and then the heat very gradually increased. Dry friction should first of all be practised by the hand, for which slightly warmed cloths may afterwards be substituted, and then the patient may be exposed to the air of a warm room at a distance from the fire. When this stage has been passed and the erythematous condition has supervened, the best applications are stimulant lotions, such as camphorated alcohol, rubbed into the part. The question of food is also important. At first both food and drink should be cold, and warm nourishment should be permitted only gradually. Treatment of Chilblains.—When chilblains are present and the skin is still unbroken, various applications, in which flexile collodion is the vehicle, are of use. The following are the most valuable. When there is great itching, the irritation can be much relieved by the applica- tion of flexile collodion containing two per cent, of cocaine. In painting this on a chilblain affecting, say, the toe, care must be taken not to surround the base of the toe completely with it, as otherwise the con- traction which ensues as it dries will constrict the toe and interfere with the return circulation. The collodion should, therefore, only be painted on the main portion of the chilblain, and no collodion should be applied on one side (in the case of the great toe, the outer side). When the chilblains are very tender, turpentine is useful, and the following prescription is very satisfactory: The turpentine does not allow the collodion to dry completely, and the stocking is consequently apt to stick to the skin ; it is well, therefore, to place a piece of boric lint around the toe outside the collodion as soon as B Collodion Venice turpentine Castor oil 2 07.. 6 drachms 3 drachms.

INTOEING all that is required, but this general treatment may be supplemented by a system of exercises designed to improve the general muscular power. A list of such exercises will be found under Scohosis (p. 423). Massage of the legs is also of value. In addition, the child should wear strong boots which are frequently mended and prevented from irregular wear by metal plates. In the coimtry the child may wear sandals or go barefoot. INTOEING. This condition is often difficult to correct, the child walking with the toes pointing inwards, so that when he attempts to run he trips over his own feet and falls. TREATMENT.—General treat- ment on the lines mentioned above is of value, but in addition it is usually necessary to provide some means of rotating the feet outwards, and for this purpose the apparatus shown in Fig. 99 is useful. A band of elastic webbing is fastened to the outer side of the toe of the boot and then wound round the leg, passing behind the knee and over the front of the thigh, to end at a point in the middle of the back, where it is fixed to a belt or to the child's braces ; this is kept tight and exerts a steady external pull sufficient to correct the deformity. Fig. 99.—Whitman's Apparatus for In TOEING.—The photograph shows the appa ratus as constructed by the parent of an out-patient. Bands of elastic are fastened to the outer parts of the boots and then wound spirally around the limbs, being attached above to the back of the gurdle.

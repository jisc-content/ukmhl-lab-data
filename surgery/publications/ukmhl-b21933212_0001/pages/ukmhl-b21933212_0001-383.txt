353 TALIPES EOUINO-VARUS with the plaster of Paris bandages, whicli sliould be renewed about once a week, for six months. Every time the l^andages are renewed the leg should be well rubbed and the galvanic current applied to the muscles. At the end of about six weeks, or in some cases even earlier, it will generally be possible to carry out the second stage of the treatment, namely the correction of the talipes equinus. Before doing this, however, the foot must be examined to see whether any fresh contraction of the ligaments or the plantar fascia has occurred. Should contraction have recurred, the tenotomy and wrenching must be repeated before the tendo Achillis is divided. The best indication as to the proper time for the correction of the talipes equinus is that the foot should retain its corrected Fir,. Ii6.- -Thomas's Wrench.â€”A sliows the wrciuli, /?.

(Robert Jones.) position when the apparatus is taken off, or, at any rate, it should be possible to make it resume it at once by gentle pressure. When this stage has been reached, the tendo Achillis is divided and the equinus treated on the lines already laid down (see p. 322). About three weeks later the patient may be allowed to walk about wearing a suitable appa- ratus ; for poor people the most convenient is Sayre's (see Fig. 104) which should be renewed every week. If the patient can afford a suitable apparatus, it is best to employ a suitable shoe or splint about three weeks after the tenotomy ; with the use of this should be combined massage and the application of electricity. In infants the light metal splint already described (see p. 316) is the best. This splint should be applied with the foot in the faulty position, and the varus deformity subsequently over-corrected ; it should be taken off night and morning for massage and galvanisation of the muscles.

22 MESSRS. LONGMANS' WORKS ON MEDICINE, SURGERY, ETC. MONOGRAPHS ON BIOCHEMISTRY. Edited by R. H. ADERS PLIMMER, D.Sc, and F. GOWLAND HOPKINS, D.Sc, F.R.S. Royal 8vo. In these volumes an attempt is being made to make the subject of Bio- chemistry more accessible by issuing a series of monographs upon the various chapters of the subject, each independent of and yet dependent upon the others, so that from time to time, as new material and the demand therefor necessitate, a new edition of each monograph can be issued without reissuing the whole series. The expenses of publication and the expense to the purchaser will thus be diminished, and by a moderate outlay it will be possible to obtain a full account of any particular subject as nearly current as possible.

294 DEFORMITIES in turning aside the skin over the contracted fascia, and it is a good plan to pass a tenotomy knife between the skin and the fascia before making the skin incision so as to separate the two structures from one another ; this, however, should only be done in one or two places, and then very cautiously, because it endangers the vitality of the skin to a certain extent. After the flaps are turned aside, the contracted band of fascia is dissected out, together with all the slips going to the fingers. Sub- sequently the contracted ligaments around the joint may be divided Fig. 88.â€”Excision of the Palmar Fascia. The left-hand figure shows the in- cision made over the contracted band of fascia that is to be excised. In the right-hand figure (drawn to a larger scale), the flaps are shown turned aside, and the slips of con- tracted fascia requiring to be dissected out are seen. with a tenotomy knife, if this should be found necessary in order to bring the finger straight. This operation can sometimes be per- formed under local anaesthesia, the whole of the tissues around the con- tracted band being thoroughly infiltrated with the analgesic solution. The patient can then often help materially by moving the fingers so as to make the various bands stand out one after the other. It is often difficult to approximate the edges of the wound after the operation, especially when a portion of the skin has been excised. This is largely due to the fact that the skin is contracted in both the transverse and the longitudinal directions. The skin should be sutured as closely as possible, and immediate skin-grafting should be employed for any raw surface left. It is imperative that no granulating surface

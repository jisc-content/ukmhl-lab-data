363 CHAPTER XVII. CURVED TIBIA AND FIBULA. Curvature of the bones of the ]eg is one of the commonest results of rickets. A certain amount of curvature of these bones may also occur in syphilis, osteitis deformans, osteo-malacia, and some other diseases. In the cases due to rickets the degree and situation of the curve vary con- siderably. The most usual condition is a uniform curvature of the entire shaft of the bone with the convexity outwards and somewhat forwards, whilst the shaft becomes flattened from side to side, and there is a tend- ency to an increased production of bone in the concavity which acts as a support. In other cases the bend, which is somewhat more acute, occurs either just above the lower epiphysis or, more rarely, a little below the upper. This may be met with either alone or in combination with the uniform outward curvature. In rare cases the tibia may be convex inwards instead of outwards. The conditions met with most frequently, however, are an outward bowing of the tibia or an acute anterior curve immediately above the ankle, or a combination of the two. TREATMENT.^â€”This should be partly general and partly local. The general treatment should be that appropriate for rickets, since this disease is the primary cause of the deformity. The whole subject of rickets is discussed in Vol. II.; here we need only say that its treatment is partly dietetic and partly hygienic. We append the table of direc- tions given to the mothers of rickety children at Paddington Green Children's Hospital. These rules embrace both dietetic and hygienic instruction, and, although mainly designed for the use of hospital out- patients, may, with a little modification, be apphed to private practice. FEEDING. I. If the Mother is perfectly healthy and has plenty of Milk, breast milk alone should be given until the infant is 8 months old. Suckle every 2 hours by day, and twice b}' night, until the child is 3 months

DIVISION I. INFLAMMATION AND ITS SEQUEL.^:. CHAPTER I. INFLAMMATION. DBFIlSriTIOlSr.—Inflammation may oe defined as the first series of changes that occur in a tissue as the result of an injury, provided that the latter has not been sufficiently violent to destroy the vitality of the part at once. When an injury is done to a part, whether the injury be chemical or mechanical in nature, a certain series of changes at once commences there, and this we call inflammation, so long as it is of an exudative or destructive character. The amount of inflammatory change in the tissue will depend upon the length of time that the process lasts, and the severity and result of the inflammation will be propor- tionate to the length of time that the irritant exerts its influence, and the intensity with which it acts. Inflammation is divided into two forms—acute and chronic. ACUTE INFLAMMATION. PATHOLOGY.—It is only necessary here to enumerate the changes that take place in the tissues after an injury. Changes in the Early Stages.—In the first instance they consist of dilatation of the blood-vessels, preceded in some cases by contrac- tion. This dilatation chiefly affects the small arteries and capiUaries, but also to some extent the veins. The circulation of the blood is I. B

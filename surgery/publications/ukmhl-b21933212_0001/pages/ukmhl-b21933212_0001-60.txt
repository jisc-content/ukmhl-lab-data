32 INFLAMMATION AND ITS SEQUELS gently, and any recesses from which pus wells out should be thoroughly opened up. After this has been done, very satisfactory results are often obtained from sponging the surface of the wound with undiluted carbolic acid with the view of destroying the micro-organisms if possible. The incisions should be packed for a day or two with strips of cyanide gauze wrung out of i in 2000 sublimate solution and sprinkled with iodoform, and outside them an ordinary antiseptic dressing should be applied (see P- 150). After-tpeatment—If this treatment fails to bring the process to a standstill, resort should be had to constant irrigation or to a water-bath. Fig. 9.—Constant Irrigation by means of a Strand of Worsted. The method of arrangiiig the mackintosh so as to drain ofi the fluid is also shown. fresh incisions being made from time to time in any area showing signs of extension of the inflammation. In practising irrigation the apparatus used to convey the fluid, must not allow the latter to drop on to the wound, as this will cause intolerable pain in a very short time. If a tube be employed, its end must lie upon the skin at the highest point of the wound. Perhaps the best plan is to convey the fluid to the wound by means of capillary action. A vessel containing the lotion is placed at a higher level than the part, and a strand of worsted or gauze is placed so that one end is in the lotion, while the other lies on the upper part of the wound ; the fluid runs along these threads very quickly, and the wound is thus constantly washed with it (see Fig. 9). The liquid used for irrigation should be at or slightly above the temperature of the body [i.e. ioo°-io5° F.), and this can be arranged for by keeping a night-light under the vessel containing it.

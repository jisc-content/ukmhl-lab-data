TREATMENT OF INCISED WOUNDS 141 and the button is then secured in place. Only a few of these button stitches need be inserted ; as a rule, two pairs suffice in a breast case. The larger the button used the better ; the pressure is then more evenly distributed over the skin, and there is less likelihood of sloughing from its pressure. In order to avoid this, it is well to adopt the precaution of inserting a small wad of gauze between each button and the skin ; a small slough generally forms where the wire penetrates the skin, but this causes Fig. 42.—Method of Suturing a Wound where there is much Tension on THE Edges. On either side is a pair of button sutures, showing the figure-of-eight arrangement by which the wire is fastened. In the centre is a relaxation stitch of stout silver wire showing the manner in which the wire is tied and its ends clipped off. A con- tinuous ' button-hole ' stitch unites the edges of the skin which, by the aid of the button sutures and the silver wire stitch, come together without tension. The pucker- ing of the sldn caused by the tension upon the button sutures and silver wire stitch is also indicated. The skin has been freely undermined. no trouble in an aseptic wound, and heals readily when the buttons are removed. Several ' stitches of relaxation ' inserted midway between the buttons and the edge of the wound (see p. 140) will also be required to take off tension from the edges of the wound. The button stitches are usually left in for about five or six days ; they are the first sutures to be removed, partly because the skin will not retract after being stretched for that length of time, and partly because they are apt to cause a slough if they are in longer. (c) When there is Moderate Tension.—When only moderate trac- tion is required to bring the edges together, a very good material for a stitch, and one that is intermediate between one of ' relaxation ' and

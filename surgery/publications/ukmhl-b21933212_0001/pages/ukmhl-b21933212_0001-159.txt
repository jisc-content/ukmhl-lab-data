MODES OF HEALING deformity due to the contraction of the scar is sometimes very serious ; it is evident, therefore, that heaUng by granulation is not such a desirable process as is union by first intention. HEALING BY UNION OF GRANULATIONS. In this mode of healing the edges of the wound are not brought together in the first instance, but are intentionally kept apart with dressings until both surfaces are granulating, when the surfaces are washed and brought together. The result is that these granulating surfaces adhere over a considerable area and union occurs rapidly ; but the risks attendant on healing by granulation, to which reference has just been made, apply to this method of healing also. It is not a mode that should be deliberately chosen when other methods are available, but it is well to bear in mind that healing may occur in this way. K 2.

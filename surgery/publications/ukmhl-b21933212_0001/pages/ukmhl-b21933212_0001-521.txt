THE ENUMERATION OF THE LEUCOCYTES 491 easy to distinguish the leucocytes if they are unstained, and it is pre- ferable to use a rather strong saUne solution (10 grains to sj, or there- abouts) by which means the red corpuscles become crenated and are readily distinguished from the leucocytes. The use of solutions which dissolve the red corpuscles is not so convenient, and will not be described. Thoma's hcemocytometer consists of a pipette (S) and a counting chamber [a). The former has a glass capillary tube (with graduations on it) which dilates into a bulb [E) containing a glass ball to act as a stirrer. Above this again there is a short length of capillary tubing with a transverse mark with the figure loi above it. The longer capillary Fig. 211.â€”Thoma's HyEMocvioMEiER. tube is divided into tenths, and the division nearest the bulb (which is the only one which need be taken into account in the present examination) is marked i. The volumes of the various parts of the instrument are so proportioned that if blood be sucked up the longer capillary to this mark, and the diluting fluid to the mark loi above the bulb, the bulb itself will contain blood diluted 100 times. The counting chamber consists of a plate-glass slide (0), to the centre of which a small glass disc [B] is cemented. Around this disc, but separated from it by a narrow space or ' moat ' (r), there is a square plate of glass which is exactly -^jjih. of a miUimetre deeper than the central disc {W) : thus if a drop of fluid be placed on the central disc and a perfectly flat cover-glass {D) be placed in absolute contact with the outer square ring it will squeeze the drop of fluid into a perfectly uniform layer mm. in depth. The central disc (a part of which is shown more highly magnified

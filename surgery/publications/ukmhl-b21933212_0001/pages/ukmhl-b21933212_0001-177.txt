TREATMENT OF INCISED WOUNDS 149 Cases calling" for Drainag^e.—^The following are the chief con- ditions in which drainage seems desirable : (1) In amputation wounds.—After amputation it would not do to keep the flaps firmly pressed together for fear of interfering with their blood-supply, while it would be equally hurtful to allow blood to distend them, and possibly lead to gangrene. Therefore it seems advisable to introduce a drainage-tube in all cases of amputation. (2) When a cavity is left.—For example, after excision of one-half of the thyroid gland a cavity is left into which bleeding is very apt to occur, for pressure cannot be applied satisfactorily without interfering with the trachea ; in these and similar cases the Fig. 50.—Suture of Muscles by the Mattress Stitch.—This suture is used when the muscular fibres have been divided transversely. temporary use of a drainage-tube is advisable. A drainage- tube is also of service when the wound is very extensive, as after removal of the breast for cancer. (3) When there is oozing which cannot be stopped by ligature—e.g. in abdominal operations, where a large number of adhesions have been broken down and there is a definite liability to the formation of a hcematoma. (4) III very fat people.—Wounds in very stout people seem to fill with oil, and this apparently interferes with the proper healing of the w'ound ; in these cases also it is well to employ drainage. (5) When there is a risk of sepsis.—Drainage should always be employed when a sinus or ulcer is present at the seat of operation, and also in compound fractures, lest the attempt to disinfect them prove unsuccessful.

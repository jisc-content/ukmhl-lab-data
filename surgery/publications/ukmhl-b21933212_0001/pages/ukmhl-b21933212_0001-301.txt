DEFORMITIES AFFECTING THE FINGERS AND TOES 273 When the Web is Narrow.—This is a much more difficult con- dition to treat successfuUy. Under these circumstances the operation just described is unsuitable, for although healing might be obtained at the cleft, a large raw surface would be left along the side of each finger, which would contract and lead to lateral bending and flexion of the fingers if it were allowed to heal by granulation; the patient would finally have the fingers flexed and bent to one side, with a rigid scar running along the flexor aspect of the finger on that side. This contraction may ABC Fig. 72.—Didot's Operation for Webbed Fingers. A and B in the upper row show the incisions. C shows the fingers separated. In the lower row are diagrammatic cross-sections of two adjacent fingers before, during, and after operation. be prevented to some extent by immediate skin-grafting (see p. 52), a single long graft being applied to the raw surface on each side, and the fingers being bound together and left undisturbed for ten days. The result of skin-grafting in these cases, however, is not generally satisfactory, as contraction often occurs in spite of it. Simple splitting and skin- grafting is therefore not to be recommended. Didot's Operation.—The operation most commonly adopted for this particular form of the deformity is that known as Didot's (see Fig. 72). It is performed as follows : two incisions are made, one along the middle of the dorsal sui face of one finger, and another along the middle of the palmar surface of the other, from a point opposite the free end of I.

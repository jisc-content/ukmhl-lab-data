TALIPES EOUINO-VARUS 359 tomy knife. This is similar to Parker's syndesmotomy (see p. 351). It is important to do this before proceeding to divide bone, as otherwise an unnecessarily large amount of the tarsus will have to be removed in order to get the foot into position. One of the most important features in this preUminary procedure is the free division of the front part of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint, which will allow the os calcis to be pressed outwards towards its normal position, for in these bad cases the patient generally walks upon the outer side of the os calcis as well as upon the outer aspect of the dorsum of the foot. It is also advantageous to amplify the freedom of movement obtained after tenotomy by the use of Thomas's wrench (see p. 352). Fig. 118.â€”CuNnii oEM Tarsectomy for Talipes Equino-varus. The black line indicates the incision. The darl<er portion indicates the amount of bone that must be removed. After all the tight structures on the inner side of the foot have been divided or stretched to their utmost extent, the surgeon makes an incision along the outer border of the foot, commencing at the base of the fifth metatarsal and terminating just in front of and about an inch below the tip of the external malleolus. This incision is carried directly down to the bone, and the soft parts are raised in one mass from both dorsal and plantar surfaces of the tarsus with a periosteum detacher. The operation is greatly facilitated by making a second incision along the inner border of the foot, commencing just below and in front of the tip of the internal malleolus and terminating a finger's breadth behind the base of the first metatarsal. This enables the soft structures to be raised from the bones on the inner side and thus the tarsus can be denuded of all the soft struc- tures, above and below, opposite the two incisions. It will be necessary

Unless this be done, the graft adheres to the blade and may be either partially or wholly cut through before a sufficient length has been obtained. The razor is made to penetrate through about half the thick- Fig. 17.—Thieksch's Method of Skin-grafting. Cullitig the gri/ls.

The wider the blade the better caa long, wide grafts be cut. ness of the skin, and then, by a lateral sawing motion, the grafts are cut as broad and as long as possible. After a little practice it is easy to cut grafts about two inches in breadth, and four or five in length. If one graft be insufficient, it is best to slide it off the razor and leave it lying on the bleeding surface ; in this way it is kept warm and moist. Some surgeons put the graft into warm sterilised saline solution, and it is then said to spread out more easily afterwards. Small skin-grafts can be cut under local anaesthesia.

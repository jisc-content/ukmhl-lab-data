10 INFLAMMATION AND ITS SEQUELS, that the weight of the ice does not cause pressure upon the inflamed area. A convenient plan is to tie the ice-bag to a bed-cradle, so that it just touches the part where cold is required. A piece of Unt should be placed between the ice-bag and the skin to absorb the moisture (see Fig. 2). The ice will require renewal as it melts, and therefore the bag should be inspected frequently. The condition of the part should be carefully- watched, and if the skin become dusky from excess of venous blood, or if the circulation in it be markedly slowed—as shown by pressing on the skin and watching the rapidity with which the vessels fill again—the use of cold should be abandoned. Fig. 4.—Leiter's Tubes. This form is the best for use upon most occasions. The tubes are coiled upon and fixed to a light flexible metal plate, and hence are not likely to become kinked or to leak. The metal plate is moulded to the surface and secured by tapes, a fold of lint being interposed between it and the skin. A stiU more effectual way of employing cold is by means of Leiter's Tubes, which consist of fine lead tubing twisted into a flat spiral coil and then moulded so as to surround the part without causing any undue pressure. Through this a constant stream of water is passed, and any required degree of cold can be obtained according to the temperature of the water. Between the tubing and the skin a ])iece of lint should be placed (see Figs. 3, 4). Intense cold may be produced by these tubes, and it is seldom advis- able to leave them on an acutely inflamed part for more than twenty- four hours at a time. The condition of the circulation should be noted every three or four hours. The tubes are more useful for arresting bleed-

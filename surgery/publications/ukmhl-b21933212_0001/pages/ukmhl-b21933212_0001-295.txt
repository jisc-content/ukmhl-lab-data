In this division will be included the various deformities of the extremities (along with scoliosis) which are usually grouped together under Orthopaedic Surgery. Deformities in other regions will be discussed in connection with the affections of those regions. Deformities may be divided into two great groupsâ€”congenital and acquired deformities. Of the former we shall only deal with those that can be improved by treatment; those for which nothing surgical can be done will not be described. The acquired deformities are due to such various causes and a number of causes are so often at work in any given case that it is not possible to group them according to their causes. We shall therefore describe them according to the regions in which thev occur. SUPERFLUOUS DIGITS. The number of supernumerary digits varies widely ; in some cases ten in all have been met with. The condition is usually bilateral and frequently affects both hands and feet. In the foot it is commonest to find a supernumerary toe on the outer side, forming an accessory little toe. In the hand the most usual deformity is an accessory little finger, but an additional thumb is not at all infrequently met with. The degree of development of the supernumerary member varies within wide limits ;

The disease may be acquired, usually as the result of impure sexual connection, or it may be contracted in utero ; in the latter case it is called congenital. ACQUIRED SYPHILIS. Although syphilis is generally a venereal disease, extra-genital infection is well known, and may take place from direct contact with an infectious person or from some article which has been used by him. Syphilis is peculiar in that the manifestations of the chsease vary with the lapse of time after infection, and hence it is usually described as having three stages. This division is convenient clinically, though there are theoretical objections to it. The disease has a distinct tendency to subside, especially under appropriate treatment. The earlier lesions are locahsed, superficial, symmetrical, and highly infectious, and are accompanied by constitutional sjanptoms, such as anaemia and often slight pyrexia at night. The later lesions are erratic in their distribution, and are less infectious, but may produce severe loss of tissue. Primary Stage.â€”The first manifestation of acquired syphilis appears as an induration at the seat of inoculation, commonly termed a ' hard ' or ' Hunterian ' chancre, which generally undergoes ulceration.

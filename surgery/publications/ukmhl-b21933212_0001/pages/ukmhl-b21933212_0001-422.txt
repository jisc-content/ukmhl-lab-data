392 DEFORMITIES COXA VALGA. In this deformity the head of the femur is displaced upwards, and the shaft is abducted ; in other words there is an increase in the angle made by the neck of the femur with the shaft. Associated with this alteration in the angle there may be a curvature backwards or forwards of the neck. The deformity is present to some extent in the majority of cases of congenital dislocation of the hip ; it is then probably secondary to dislocation forwards of the head of the bone. It has also been described in association with infantile palsy, as a result of rickets, secondary to genu valgum, and as a sequel of some forms of fracture of the neck of the femur. The signs are abduction and external rotation of the limb, with limitation of adduction and inversion. In imilateral cases, there is an increased length of the limb. There is flattening over the great trochanter, which may be below the level of Nelaton's line. The outer aspect of the trochanter may also be directed backwards. Very little is really known either of the pathology or the treatment of this affection; we shall therefore not go further into the matter at present.

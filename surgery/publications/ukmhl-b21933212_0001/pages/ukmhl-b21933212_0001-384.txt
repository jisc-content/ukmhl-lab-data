354 DEFORMITIES the child is able to walk, a Scarpa's shoe may be applied and should be worn continuously for many months and sometimes for years. Although the deformity may seem to be corrected perfectly, it takes a considerable time for the shape of the bones to be influenced materially, and the deformity will inevitably be reproduced if the apparatus be left off too soon, and often in a more severe form than the original one. Fig. 117.â€”Scarpa's Shoe. On the right-hand side is seen the apparatus before use. The two ratchets (turned by the Itey shown below the figure), the lower one for flexing and extending the ankle, and the upper for inverting or everting the foot, are seen near the junction of the outside leg-iron with the foot-piece. The broad sling used to puU outwards the front part of the foot is also seen in front attached to a button on the end of the stout spring attached to the outer side of the sole and exerting a forcible outward pull. In the left-hand figure the apparatus is applied to a case of equino-varus. The foot is firmly everted, the toes raised, the heel depressed, and the front half of the foot pulled outwards. In Scarpa's shoe (see Fig. 117) there is a leg-piece appUed to the calf, on the outer side of which is attached an iron bar connected with a foot-piece. Opposite the ankle there are two hinges, one corresponding to the ankle joint proper, from which flexion and extension of the foot-piece is made, whilst the other raises or depresses the side of the foot so as to bring it into a position of eversion or inversion. A strong spring bent considerably outwards is fixed to the outer side of the front .of the foot-piece and from this a band is carried around the anterior part of the foot which can thus be brought into a position of abduction, by the

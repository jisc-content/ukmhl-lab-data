It may sometimes be undesirable to subject the patient to the comparatively slight dangers and discom- forts of a general anaesthetic, but to limit the anaesthesia to the area to be operated upon. In such cases local ancesthesia may be employed. PART I. GENERAL ANAESTHESIA. PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. Preparation of the Patient.â€”With the possible exception of nitrous oxide (see p. 448), an anaesthetic is always taken better if the patient has been subjected, for a few days, to what may be termed hospital regime. This does not of necessity mean absolute confinement to bed, but it implies rest of body and mind, careful regulation of the ordinary bodily functions, light and easily digested diet, and abstention from alcohol. Young children and highly neurotic adults are often best kept in ignorance of an impending operation, but such patients frequently give trouble under an anaesthetic, and so confirm the value of the general rule. It has been suggested that a course of some such drug, as strychnine, quinine, iron, etc., should be given for a few days before the operation, v.'ith a view to obviating some of the difficulties and dangers which may arise during the administration of an anaesthetic.

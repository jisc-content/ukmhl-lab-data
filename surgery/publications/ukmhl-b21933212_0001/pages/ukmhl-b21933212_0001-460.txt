DEFORMITIES 43P 8. Left hand, ditto. Fig. 170. 3. Same exercise lying on the side ; the concavity of the principal curve downwards (see Fig. 170). It is an exercise of over-correction, which is very difficult to perform and also to teach. Series J.—With Dowd's Machine. Note.—In using Dowd's machine, the patient is to commence without any other weight than that of the weight-carrier. Gradually weights are added as the doctor may direct. It may, for various reasons, be found necessary to add more weights to one side than to the other. For instance, in the face-to-machine exercises for a patient with rotation to the right, it would be well to place more weights on the right side than the left. In the back-to-machine exercises greater weight on the left would then tend to untwist. 1. Patient facing machine.—Patient stands facing machine. Right hand straight out in front, grasping handle of machine, is made to describe a circle in a horizontal plane, being carried as far back as possible. Return to original position. 2. Ditto, left hand. 3. Same exercise, both hands together (see Fig. 171, which shows the exercise, but with the patient back to machine, vide Series K, 3). Fig. 171. 4. Right hand held vertically up, grasping handle of machine, is brought down in front, describing a semicircle in a vertical plane. 5. Ditto, left hand. 6. Ditto, both hands at same time (see Fig.172, which is also back to machine, vide Series K 6). Fig. 172. 7. Right hand held vertically up and straight, grasping handle of machine, is brought down at the side describing a semicircle in a vertical plane. Return to original position.

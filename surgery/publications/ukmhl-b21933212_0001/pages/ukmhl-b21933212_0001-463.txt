433 SCOLIOSIS ir. Series J, Number i6, reversed. 12. 14. 15- 16. 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, Series L.—Side to Machine Exercises. 1. Right side to machine ; arm straight out grasping handle is carried upwards to side of head ; returns to first position, pauses, and is brought down to side ; reverse ; repeat. 2. Lett side to machine ; same exercise for left arm. 3. Right side to machine; left forearm resting on head, left hand over right ear grasping handle (see Fig. 180). Patient leans as far as possible to- wards machine, recovers and leans as far as possible away from it ; hips and legs immov- able (see Fig. 181). Fig. 181. 4. Repeat with left side to machine, right arm over head. 5. Repeat 3, with a circular instead of a to-and-fro movement. 6. Repeat 4, with a circular instead of a to-and-fro movement. Note.—It will be seen that most of the exercises with Dowd's machine are chiefly the previous exercises performed with apparatus. The macliine simply is an accurate means of adding increasing resistance by putting more weights on to the carrier. The same remarks apply more or less to all the developing macliines here- after mentioned. Series M.—Exercises with a Single Dowd's Machine, the Rope passing under a Pulley attached to the Floor. (Face to Machine.) 1. Right arm obliquely in front holding handle. Raise to the vertical by side of head without bending arm. 2. Left arm ditto. 3. Both grasping handle at same time (see Fig. 182). Fig. 182. 4. Right arm obliquely in front, raise forearm as far as possible without moving upper arm. 5. Left arm ditto. I. F F

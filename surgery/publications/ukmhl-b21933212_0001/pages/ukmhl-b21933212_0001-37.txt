ACUTE INFLAMMATION 9 cold should be limited to the early stages of inflammation, for it is hardly likely that it wiU arrest the process when much exudation has taken place, while in this stage the danger of weakening the tissue is especially great. Probably the mildest method of using cold is in the form of an Evaporating Lotion.^ A piece of lint is placed over the skin and kept constantly moist with the lotion, the part being freely exposed to the air to favour rapid evaporation; the patient can generally keep the hnt moist for himself. Another favourite lotion is the liquor plumbi sub- FiG. 3.—Leiter's Tubes. The illustration shows the method of using the tubes by coiling them in a spiral manner around the limb. acetatis dilutus (B.P.) used as described above. If there be much pain, 10 to 20 minims of tinct. opii may be added to each ounce of this. If greater reduction of temperature be required, dry cold should be used, because the wet form is more apt to lead to gangrene than is the dry. Dry cold may be appUed by means of an Ice-hag, crushed ice being placed in an indiarubber bag or a bladder suspended over the part so The following may be found useful :—• Ammonii chloridi . gss.

DEFORMITIES 422 In the early stages no form of brace or support is permissible which tends to keep the spinal colmnn rigid. Such an apparatus undoubtedly supports the spine to some extent, and may therefore make the patient more comfortable and relieve him of the heavy, dull, aching pain of which he complains; but its action is most mischievous, since it is essential for cure that the muscles primarily at fault should be encouraged to perform their function of supporting the spine, and the confinement entailed by a tight- fitting jacket not only fails to effect this, but even produces actual wasting of the muscles. We are inchned to hmit the use of apparatus to cases in which the curvature shows signs of increasing in spite of vigorous treatment on the lines just mentioned, or to those in which the pain is Fig. 147.—'Spinal Brace' for Scoliosis. This may be taken to represent the general type. The various parts are adjustable by means of nuts. {Percy Lewis.) severe and the weakness of the muscles excessive. Even then, the support should only be worn occasionally during the day, not all day long, and should be as light as is consistent with efficacy. It should be made of light steel bars taking purchase from a pelvic band, and should be furnished with suitably padded springs so directed as to apply pressure at the requisite spots—which are generally the convexity of the curve and over the angles of the ribs where they are rotated backwards. The apparatus should be so fashioned as only to support the spine when it is in a position of rest; that is to say, it should not be sufficiently tight-fitting to keep the spine immovable and therefore interfere with the proper action of the back muscles. At night no apparatus should be worn, attention being mainly directed to the posture in which the patient sleeps. A spinal brace of this kind is shown in Fig. 147. It requires careful adjustment as the curva- ture diminishes.

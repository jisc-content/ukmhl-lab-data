FLAT FOOT 303 another. These exercises should not be carried to the extent of tiring the patient. They should be very light at first and increased gradually ; it is better to practise them several times a day for a short time than to have a single long sitting. For a week or two after the plaster casing has been left off, the patient should be content with these exercises, which should be combined with massage and rest, with the limb in the tailor- position ; no attempts should be made at walking. As soon, however, as he is allowed to get about, there is no better form of exercise for the foot muscles than bicycling, which may be indulged in freely. Whitman's Spring.—-When the tenderness in the sole has almost disappeared and no adhesions in the tarsal joints remain, the patient may be allowed to walk with a suitable support in the boot. The best Fig. 92.—Whitman's Brace. The lint has been folded around the foot and its edge turned down. form of this is Whitman's spring or ' brace,' the so-called ' artificial instep ' (see Fig. 95). The apparatus consists of a support modeUed upon a plaster cast of the foot taken whilst the arch of the instep is held in the fully corrected position. It fits the arch of the foot accurately, extending forwards almost to the balls of the toes, outwards round the outer border of the foot, and backwards to just in front of the tuberosity of the os calcis. On the inner side it is enlarged upwards and extends well on to the inner side of the foot. With a properly made support, the weight of the foot is not borne upon the apparatus at all until the arch begins to sink ; the foot rests upon its normal bases of support, namely, the under surfaces of the heads of the metatarsal bones and the tuberosities of the OS calcis, and the spring only comes into action when the arch of the foot

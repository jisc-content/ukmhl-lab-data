237 [ DIVISION IV. TUMOURS. CHAPTER XIII. TUMOURS. DBFI]SriTIO]Sr.—Tumours may be defined as localised swellings which, though part of the body, grow continuously and independently of it and without relation to any known cause. A tumour continues to grow, and, as a rule, nothing short of its complete removal will permanently arrest its development. It must be distinguished from hyperplasia on the one hand and from an inflammatory swelling on the other. Hyperplasia is a simple increase in the size of an organ, which, however, retains its natural form and structure and, as far as we know, its function ; inflammatory swellings do not possess any inherent power of growth and only continue to increase as long as tlie causes which give rise to them continue to act. Tumours may grow inside an investing capsule or they may be devoid of one, and they then grow by invading the surrounding tissues, destroying them and taking their place ; in some cases minute portions of the tumour may be carried by the lymphatics or blood-vessels to distant parts and there give rise to secondary growths. It is unnecessary to go fully into the question of tumours here, because their treatment must be discussed in detail in connection with the various organs and tissues in which they occur. We shall, however, make a few general remarks concerning them in order to save repetition in the future. CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION".—Tumours may be classified both from a clinical and a histological point of view. Clinically they are divided into simple and malignant tumours.

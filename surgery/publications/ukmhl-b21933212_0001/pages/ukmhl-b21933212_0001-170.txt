142 WOUNDS one of ' coaptation,' is silkworm or fishing gut. This should be fairly thick, and, if a good hold of the skin be taken, the latter can be made to bear a considerable amount of tension without bad results. ' Stitches of Coaptation.'—It was formerly the practice to use interrupted sutures to bring the edges of the wound accurately together, each suture being separately inserted, knotted, and divided. Most surgeons now employ a continuous suture, which has the advantage that the edges are more accurately approximated by it and that it is much more rapidly inserted, a point of importance when a large wound requires to be closed at the end of a long or severe operation. Fig. 43.—Method of Inserting the Button-hole Suture.—The sketch shows how the needle is brought out inside the loop formed by the thread from the last section of the stitch. The best form of continuous suture is that known as the blanket or button-hole siitch (see Fig. 43). The suture is first inserted at one end of the wound and tied ; then, instead of cutting the thread, the needle is passed through the two edges of the wound, and brought out inside the loop formed by the thread, and drawn tight, and this is con- tinued till the whole wound is stitched up ; the end may be secured either by leaving the last loop long and tying a knot between it and the free end of the thread, or by taking several turns of the thread around the needle as it forms the last loop and then tightening it up (see Fig. 44). The result is that along one side of the wound there is a continuous thread of silk, which acts very Uke the old quilled suture.

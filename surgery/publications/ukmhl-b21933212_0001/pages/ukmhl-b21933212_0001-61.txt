Perhaps the best for the purpose are sanitas (a teaspoonful to the tumbler of water), iodine water (a teaspoonful of the Fig. 10.â€”Constant Irrigation. The method of forming a drain for the surplus fluid by raeanb of the mackintosh is also shown. The nozzle of the irrigator should always lie in direct contact with the edge of the sore. tincture of iodine to a pint of water) or permanganate of potash (two to four grains to the ounce).

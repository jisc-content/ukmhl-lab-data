DRUGS INJECTED INTO THE TISSUES 489 (1) Total or partial failure to produce the requisite degree of anaes- thesia. These failures are mostly due to imperfect perforation of the theca ; this may be owing to the puncture being made too low down, or to the needle being blunt, or held at too great an angle, the theca being then pushed to one side, or only a valvular opening made ; in these cases the stovaine solution escapes by the side of the theca itself. Or the solution may have become mixed with an alkali. Although these explan- ations suffice to explain many failures, there are, in my experience, a few others, which can only be accounted for on the grounds that the patient has some peculiar idiosyncrasy. It is generally recommended that, in case of failure, a second injection of half a dose should be made, and I have not seen any ill-effects follow this plan. Of course, it causes the patient some additional suffering. (2) Although syncope and partial collapse are generally due almost entirely fright, the possibility of the occurrence of these symptoms mvist be borne in mind before deciding upon employing this method in the neurotic. (3) Of the immediate after-effects the most important are, headache, abdominal pain and retention of urine. The latter may require the catheter ; the other symptoms are transient and usually yield readily to full (15-grain) doses of aspirin. More remotely, paralytic affections of the occular nerves, various spinal paralyses, mental disturbances, gangrene of the extremities and not a few fatalities have all been ascribed to the use of this method ; but in the present state of our knowledge it would be unwise to attach too great weight to what may, after all, prove to be merely a matter of coincidence; it is perfectly certain, moreover, that many thousand cases have been subjected to this process with the greatest advantage and without the development of any untoward symptoms whatever.

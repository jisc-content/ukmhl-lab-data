148 WOUNDS comparatively seldom that drainage is required. In order to dispense with drainage safely it is essential to arrest all bleeding before the wound is closed, and then to bring the deeper parts of it into apposition so that there shall be no ' dead space' into which bleeding may take place subse- FlG. 49.—Suture of the Abdominal Wall in Two Layers.—All the structures from the peritoneum to the superficial layer of the sheath of the rectus are drawn together by stout silk sutures; the sldn is then closed with a silk suture as in Fig. 48. quently.

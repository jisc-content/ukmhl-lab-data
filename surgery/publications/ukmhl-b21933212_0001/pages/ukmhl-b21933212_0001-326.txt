298 DEFORMITIES appearance being produced by the altered position of the scapula. In many cases the shape of the scapula is unaltered, but in others it is elon- gated in a direction parallel to the spine, and in rare instances there is a separate ossicle connecting the vertebral border with the spines of the dorsal vertebrae. The muscles which elevate the scapula are con- tracted and thickened, a point specially noticeable in the trapezius where it bounds the posterior triangle. The lower portion of the trapezius and the muscles which retract the scapula are thin and wasted. This deformity does not give rise to much disability, except that in raising the arm from the side the superior angle impinges upon the vertebral column. This Hmitation of movement is specially marked when the accessory ossicle is present. TRBATMBISTT.â€”Little benefit seems to be obtained by division of the contracted muscles, as their opponents are atrophic ; but when the superior angle comes into contact with the spine and limits elevation of the arm, this process may be sawn off with advantage. When an accessory ossicle is present it should be removed.

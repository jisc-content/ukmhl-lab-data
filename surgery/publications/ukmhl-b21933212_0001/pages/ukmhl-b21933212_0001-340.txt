312 CHAPTER XVI. CLUB-FOOT. By the term Club-foot or Talipes is understood a permanent deformity of such a nature that the foot is inclined at an angle to the leg, so that the sole no longer rests upon the ground in the normal position when the patient bears his weight upon it. The directions in which the foot may be displaced are various, and the displacements may be either simple or complex. Of the simple forms of club-foot we may enumerate Talipes Equinus, in which the heel is drawn up and the toes are pointed, the patient walking upon the extremities of the metatarsal bones ; Talipes Calcaneus, in which the reverse condition exists, the front part of the foot being drawn up and the patient walking upon the heel; Talipes Varus, in which the foot is inverted, and the patient walks upon its outer border ; and Talipes Valgtis, in which the foot is everted, and the patient walks upon the inner border. In the great majority of cases, however, the deformity is a mixed one, the most frequent being Talipes Equino-varus, which is a combination of talipes equinus with varus. Talipes Equino- valgus, Talipes Calcaneo-valgus, and various other less important forms are also met with ; there is also the affection known as Pes Cavus, or hollow club-foot, in which the arch of the instep is exaggerated and the plantar fascia is shortened. The cases of club-foot may be divided into two great classes, namely, the congenital form, in which the condition is present at birth, and the acquired one, in which the affection develops at a later period. CAUSES AND PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES.—Congenital talipes is probably due primarily to some arrest of development in the foetus more particularly to failure of the foot to rotate from its foetal to its post- natal position. During early intra-uterine life, the feet lie in a position closely resembling tahpes equino-varus, but shortly before birth the lower extremity becomes rotated in such a manner that the foot assumes its normal position; if from any cause this rotation does not take place,

86 INFLAMMATION AND ITS SEQUELS the mouth. In children there may be severe stomatitis leading to actual gangrene of portions of the mucous membrane of the gum. In these cases there is great swelling of the tongue and cheek, large areas of which are covered with a foul whitish membrane. The breath is very offensive; there is profuse salivation and the patient is often extremely ill for a time • the temperature does not run so high as in true cancrum oris, and the disease tends to run a more benign course. No specific organisms can be found in this condition, which is not sharply marked off from ordinary acute stomatitis. The best treatment for these cases is a mouth-wash containing resorcin. A good formula is the following:— The mouth should be frequently cleansed with weak sanitas (i in lo) or peroxide of hydrogen (lo vols.), and the above solution should be painted all over the affected area. A brisk calomel purge should be given, and the child put under the best hygienic surroundings obtainable. A mixture containing chlorate of potash and cinchona bark may be given internally. When the disease has become quiescent, the condition of the mouth should be carefully looked to, and any decayed teeth removed or filled. The free administration of mercury may also lead to severe gan- grenous stomatitis, especially when the mouth has been allowed to remain in a septic and neglected condition. With the smaller doses of mercury now in vogue this condition is uncommon. The treatment consists in stopping the administi'ation of mercury and employing a mouth-wash containing chlorate of potash.

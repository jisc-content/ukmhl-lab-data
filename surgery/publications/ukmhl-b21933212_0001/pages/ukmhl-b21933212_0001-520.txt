490 THE EXAMINATION OF THE BLOOD IN SURGICAL CONDITIONS. By W. D'ESTE emery, M.D., B.Sc. (Lond.), Pathologist to King's College Hospital and The Children's Hospital, Paddington Green. In a comparatively small number of cases an examination of the blood enables a certain diagnosis to be made without further clinical investiga- tion ; in the greater number it is only of use as an indication of the more probable of two diseases, and in these the interpretation of the results which are obtained is often a matter of considerable difficulty and uncer- tainty. In this short outline of the subject reference will be made chiefly to those methods of investigation which are simple to apply, and they will be described in connection with diseases in which these indications are useful and fairly conclusive. For the more difficult methods of blood examination, and for the condition of the blood in diseases other than those dealt with here, one of the larger works on the subject must be consulted. THE ENUMERATION OF THE LEUCOCYTES. This is a simple and easy proceeding, and often yields results of con- siderable value. The requisites are : A Thoma's heemocytometer, a microscope with a |th in. lens, and, preferably, a mechanical stage, and a bottle of diluting fluid. Of the latter there are several in use, but Toison's fluid is as good as any. It consists of: Sodii Sulph. ...... 8 grammes (122 grains). Sodii Chlor. ...... i gramme (15 grains). Glycerin ...... 30 c.c. (i oz.). Aquae ...... 160 c.c. (5J oz.). Methyl violet . . . . .a trace. (The English equivalents are approximate only.) It keeps well, but it is advisable to filter it before use. If this fluid is not at hand normal saline solution will answer very well, though it is less

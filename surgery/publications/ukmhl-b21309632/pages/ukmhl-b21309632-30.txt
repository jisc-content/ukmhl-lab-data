22 The Hospital lias long enjoyed the earnest, honest, and judicious services of a lady of whom it is impossible to speak too highly,—I mean Mrs. Wardroper. The Institution for training nurses by means of the funds of the Nightingale Testimonial, has not merely materially improved the system of nursing in this Hospital, but it has been of infinite service to suffering humanity, by sending forth into the world a phalanx of nurses such as have never issued from any public institution before. The very mention of the Nightingale Fund reminds me of Mr. Whitfield’s services in reference to its management, and the zealous interest he has for years shown in all the details of our School. It must not, however, be supposed that we were without good nurses previous to the advent of Mrs. Wardroper or the train- ing of the Nightingale nurses. Our head nurses, or sisters, as we still, I rejoice to say, call them, were women whose conduct was above all praise ; and in one especial instance, whose know- ledge of our profession was perfectly marvellous,—I allude to Mrs. Roberts, who went out to the Crimea with Miss Nightingale. Another of this noble band has lately been taken from us,— poor Sister Abraham; but, happily, wre have at least still one left of that glorious old school,—I mean the present Sister Accident. Now farewell! But, before we part, let me again insist, that in order to attain that excellence to which I give you all the credit of aspiring, you must make the Dissecting- room, the Lecturing Theatre, the Chemical Laboratory, and the Wards of the Hospital your dwelling-place. Works on Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry, Medicine, and Surgery should be your bosom friends, and the noble profession of Medicine, in its most extended meaning, the only goddess of your idolatry.

1 am quite sure that the colleagues by whom he is so well 10 is world-wide. I must read the titles of a few of his contribu- tions to science:â€” On the Structure of the Human Lungs and the Formation of Pulmonary Tubercle. On the Structure of Lungs in Birds, chiefly in reference to the Tissue witli which the Air in the Lungs is in Contact. On Fatty Degeneration of the Tissue of the Lung in Em- physema. Experimental Investigation of the Cause of the Ascent and Descent of the Sap in Plants, with some observations on the cause of Endosmose and Exosmose. On the Structure of the Ligamentum Rotundum Uteri in the Human Female. On the Structure and Development of the Cysticercus Celluloses in the Measly Pig. On the influence of Quantity of Matter over Chemical Affinity, as shown in the Formation of certain Double Chlorides and Oxalates. On the Structure and Mode of Formation of the Dental Tissues. On the Structure and Formation of Starch Granules. On the Structure of the Sudoriferous Glands. On the Pecten in the Eye of Birds, and the Adaptation of the Eye to Objects at different Distances. On the Mode of Formation of Shell Tissues, of Bone and other Silicious Structures. Most fortunate are wc in being able to retain the services of such a true philosopher. His knowledge is only equalled by his consummate skill in imparting it, and his unrivalled industry in the performance of those duties which he so skilfully and so much to our benefit consents to perform. Industry on your part, and serious unmistakable attention to your studies, are the only avenues to his heart. May the Almighty long spare him to us ; and may he be rewarded in a few years by the completion of an academical building more worthy of his talent, and with a class ns numer- ous as his deserts, and a scale of remuneration more in propor- tion to his value to the school of which he is one of our most substantial ornaments!

INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS. In the name of my colleagues and myself, Ladies, Mr. Treasurer, Mr. Tite, and old Students, we thank you for your presence here to-day. About forty years ago, my young friends, I commenced the study of my profession in this time-honoured school of St. Thomas’s Hospital, and though so many years have rolled over my head since, the feelings of that day have not been effaced by time. I began that journey with high hopes and lofty aspirations ; some have been crushed, some crumbled into dust, some faded away, some realized; but with all this I would, if 1 could, re-live this portion of my life, and start again with hopeful- ness in the same career. You, as travellers into this new coun- try, will not, I am sure, despise the advice of an old guide. 1 walked this path with joy, but now look back with regret that my time had not been better spent, and that many golden opportunities of reaping sound fruit have been lost for ever. I have likened you to travellers, but this is too tame a simile, are you not rather warriors, buckling on your armour to fight a noble fight for professional existence P Do not deceive yourselves: he who enters the Medical pro- fession must be prepared for a firm and uninterrupted struggle for existence. Having once enlisted, you are no longer your own master. You have undertaken duties far higher than any accepted by mortal man, excepting perhaps those of the Minister of Religion. In all truth, then, may I say :— “ A sacred burden is the life ye bear. Look on it, lift it, bear it solemnly, Stand up, walk beneath it steadfastly.

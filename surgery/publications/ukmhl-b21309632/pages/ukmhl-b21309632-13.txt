PREFACE The condescension of Her Most Gracious Majesty in laying the first stone of St. Thomas’s Hospital, the success which attended that interesting ceremony, the grand gathering of above 200 old St. Thomas’s pupils at our Biennial Dinner, and the renewed •interest thus excited in the future prosperity of our Alma Mater, has induced me to print this Address as it was delivered, with some additions which time and circumstances would not then permit me to insert. The loving sympathy which Her Majesty has ever shown for her subjects in suffering and sorrow, must assure us that she will never cease to feel an interest in this Royal Hospital, the value and importance of which had been previously recognized by her noble Consort: “ Floreat Nosoco- mium St. Thomas. ” July, 1868.—6, Savilf, Row.

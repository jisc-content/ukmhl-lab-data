ON THE AORTA. 137 free course of the blood through the aneurismal sac. That limb never recovered its natural heat, there being seven degrees difference between the two extremities; the sensibility also in the right limb was returning, which did not appear to be the case in the left. In an aneurism therefore similarly situated, I should apply the ligature before the swelling had acquired any very con- siderable magnitude. There is still a circumstance, however, that remains to be decided respecting a ligature upon the aorta; which is, in what manner it is to be afterwards separated: whether it should be left suspended at the wound, or cut off close to the vessel: whether the presse-artere of that inge- nious Surgeon Mr. Crampton should be em- ployed ; or some Unusual material should be used as a ligature. Although the patient whose case I have here given did not suffer from in- flammation of the abdomen, yet I should much fear that if he had lived longer, an extraneous substance suspended amidst the intestines would j have produced that effect. My friend Mr. Lawrence has proposed that the silk usually employed for ligatures should be cut off close to the knot, so as to heal the wound over it. It has occurred to me that catgut would answer the purpose better, and I shall give the result of the trial which I have made, wishing it to be understood that I consider the subject at present as undecided, and only as one for future investigation. Catgut, employed as a ligature, being more of the nature of the animal matter in which it is Danger from an ex- traneous substance amidst the intestines. Catgut pro- posed for a ligature.

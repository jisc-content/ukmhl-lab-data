ON EXOSTOSIS. By Mb. ASTLEY COOPER. I Exostosis is a preternatural growth of os- , sific matter, generally producing a circumscrib- ed swelling upon the bone on which it origi- i nates. This definition, although true, with very few exceptions, is not at all periods of the dis- f ease, or in every example of it, strictly accurate; i for I have examined exostoses in the early part I of the complaint, in which ossific matter had not j yet been deposited, but in which, from dissec- j tion of other cases, I know that such a deposition j would in future have occurred. I Exostosis has two difierent seats; it is either periosteal or medullary. By the periosteal exos- tosis, I mean a deposition seated between the external surface of the bone, and the internal surface of the periosteum, adhering with firm- ness to both surfaces; and by the medullary^ is to be understood a formation of a similar kind, originating in the medullary membrane and cancellated structure of the bone. With regard to its nature, exostosis is of two J kinds, either cartilaginous or Jungous. By the cartilaginous, is intended to be expressed that species which is preceded by the formation of a Definition. Two seats of exostosis.

Little blood was lost during the operation, nor did the patient suffer much pain. I endea- voured by approximating the integuments to unite the wound by adhesion, but did not succeed. Granulations of a very healthy na- ture arose from the surface of the wound, and six weeks after the operation, two small por- tions of bone exfoliated ; the patient not only recovered from the operation, but regained also the perfect use of the limb. CASE. The result of the foregoing case gratified me exceedingly ; for I felt a hope that exostosis, when seated on any accessible part of the body, might be safely removed by an operation similar to that before described: but I have a case now to relate v/hich proved by no means so fortu- nate in its result. This case, however, was of the fungous and not of the cartilaginous kind. A man who lived near to me when I re- sided in the city, had a large tumor grow- ing out of his forehead.

98 ON IRITIS. extreme arteries when fully excited by mercury. It is an erythemaâ€”an action which essentially weakens the cohesion of parts: but the adhesive inflammation is so exactly opposed to this, that both cannot be the result of mercurial action. From the moment that I commenced the study of morbid anatomy, I directed my attention to the adhesive inflammation, because it opened to my view the most usual process of disorganiza- tion in the viscera. This is not the place to enter into the pro- gress of my research respecting this important fact, or to shew that I applied the practice to the chief organs of the body before the interesting changes on the iris particularly engaged my attention. Suffice it to say, that I had been led, from repeated observation of the adhesive inflammation of various tex- tures being cured by the mercurial action, to receive it as one of the general laws of its ope- ration to change that arterial action on which the effusion of coagulable lymph depends, and consequently to arrest all the subsequent changes which flow from this process. Doubtless, there are exceptions to this general law. The class of tumors properly so called, form an immense and lamentable exception to it; and scrofula, in the same proportion that it has impaired the restorative powers of the constitution, forms another not less considerable. The extent and duration of the adhesive inflammation itself forms a third; for all reasonable expectation of success, even from the use of the most powerful remedy, is founded on, and pre-supposes a struc- 7

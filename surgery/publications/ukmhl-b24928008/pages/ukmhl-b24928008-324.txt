280 ON WOUNDS AND Exposure of câ€¢avit}^ Non adhe- sion of inte- giimental wound. Deductions from the experi- ments, to explain in- flammation after v. s. not be admitted as an objection. Yet allowing the rarity of the case and the frequency of the operation, it will be found in nine instances out of ten to ensue upon a local injury^ how- ever simple. Exposure of the cavity of the vein is a circumstance often not accompanying the injuries by which the inflammation is in- duced, and continually occurring without any ill consequence. Non-adhesion and festering of the wound in the integument is an effect of suppuration beneath it, as frequently I should think as a cause. The subcutaneous abscess, as is observed by Mr. Hunter, is of no moment if the vein and parts below have united ; in the hu- man subject, abscess at the wound and diffused inflammation of the subcutaneous cellular tex- ture, the lymphatics and their glands, and even the fascia, producing oedematous swelling and tension of the entire limb, are certainly more fre- quent than the inflammation of the vein as a consequence of venesection, where the wound has been improperly treated or neglected, and the patient suffered to use his arm without restric- tion. It appears from the experiments related that the wound of a vein after blood-letting does not take on direct adhesion, but that the last ef- fused blood forms a plug or stopper to the wound j that the agglutination is complete between the clot and the edges of the orifice whicli it occupies, and that the clot serves as a bed for the production of the new membrane. If from any cause suppuration occurs, the clot will be loosened and displaced, and the action which commonly ensues where the adhesive is defeated
